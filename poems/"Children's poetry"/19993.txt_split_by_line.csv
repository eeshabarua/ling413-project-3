124,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,*       *       *       *       *
125,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
126,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,Books are as much a part of the furnishing of a house as tables and
127,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"chairs, and in the making of a home they belong, not with the luxuries"
128,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,but with the necessities. A bookless house is not a home; for a home
129,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,affords food and shelter for the mind as well as for the body. It is
130,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,as great an offence against a child to starve his mind as to starve
131,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"his body, and there is as much danger of reducing his vitality and"
132,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,putting him at a disadvantage in his lifework in the one as in the
133,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,other form of deprivation. There was a time when it was felt that
134,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"shelter, clothing, food and physical oversight comprised the whole"
135,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,duty of a charitable institution to dependent children; to-day no
136,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,community would permit such an institution to exist unless it provided
137,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,school privileges. An acute sense of responsibility toward children
138,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"is one of the prime characteristics of American society, shown in the"
139,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"vast expenditures for public education in all forms, in the increasing"
140,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"attention paid to light, ventilation, and safety in school buildings,"
141,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"in the opening of play grounds in large cities, in physical"
142,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"supervision of children in schools, and the agitation against the"
143,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"employment of children in factories, and in other and less obvious"
144,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,ways.
145,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
146,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,Children are helpless to protect themselves and secure what they need
147,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,for health of body and mind; they are exceedingly impressionable; and
148,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,the future is always in their hands. The first and most imperative
149,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,duty of parents is to give their children the best attainable
150,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"preparation for life, no matter at what sacrifice to themselves. There"
151,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,are hosts of fathers and mothers who recognize this obligation but do
152,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,not know how to discharge it; who are eager to give their children the
153,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"most wholesome conditions, but do not know how to secure them; who are"
154,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,especially anxious that their children should start early and start
155,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,right on that highway of education which is the open road to honorable
156,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,success. There are many homes in which books would find abundant room
157,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"if the heads of the families knew what books to buy, or had the means"
158,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,to put into the hands of the growing child the reading matter it needs
159,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,in the successive periods of its growth.
160,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
161,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"This condition of eagerness to give the best, and of ignorance of how"
162,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,or where to find the best is the justification for the publication
163,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,of this set of books. The attempt has been made in a series of twelve
164,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"volumes to bring together in convenient form the fairy stories, myths,"
165,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,and legends which have fed the children of many generations in the
166,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,years when the imagination is awakening and craving stimulus and
167,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,material to work upon;--that age of myth-making which is a prelude to
168,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,the more scientific uses of the mind and of immense importance in an
169,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,intensely practical age;--a group of tales of standard quality and
170,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,an interest and value which have placed them among the permanent
171,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,possessions of English literature; a careful selection of stories
172,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"of animal life; a natural history, familiar in style and thoroughly"
173,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,trustworthy in fact; an account of those travels and adventures which
174,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"have opened up the earth and made its resources available, and which"
175,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,constitute one of the most heroic chapters in the history of the
176,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,long struggle of men to possess the earth and make it a home for
177,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,the highest kind of civilization; a record of heroism taken from the
178,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"annals of the patriots and of those brave men who, in all ages, ranks"
179,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"of society and occupations, have dared to face great dangers in the"
180,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"path of duty and science, with special attention to that everyday"
181,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,heroism in which the age is specially rich and of which so many good
182,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"people are grossly ignorant; a survey of scientific achievement, with"
183,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,reports of recent discoveries in knowledge and adaptation of knowledge
184,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,to human need; a group of biographies of the men and women--mostly
185,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,Americans--who are the most stimulating companions for boys and girls;
186,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"a volume on the Fine Arts dealing with music, painting, sculpture,"
187,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"architecture, in a way to instruct young readers and making accessible"
188,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,a large number of those songs which appeal in the best way to children
189,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,in schools and homes; a collection of the best poetry for the youngest
190,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"and oldest readers, chosen not only for excellence from the standpoint"
191,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"of art, but deep and abiding human interest; and a volume devoted to"
192,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"the occupations and resources of the home, addressed to parents no"
193,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"less than to children, with practical suggestions about books and"
194,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"reading, games and amusements, exercise and health, and those kindred"
195,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,topics which have to do with making the home wholesome and attractive.
196,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
197,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"These twelve volumes aim, in brief, to make the home the most"
198,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"inspiring school and the most attractive place for pleasure, and"
199,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"to bring the best the world has to offer of adventure, heroism,"
200,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,achievement and beauty within its four walls.
201,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
202,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,Special attention has been given to the youngest children whose
203,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,interests are often neglected because they are thought to be too
204,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,immature to receive serious impressions from what is read to them.
205,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,Psychology is beginning to make us understand that no greater
206,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,mistake can be made in the education of children than underrating the
207,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,importance of the years when the soil receives the seed most quickly.
208,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,For education of the deepest sort--the planting of those formative
209,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,ideas which give final direction and quality to the intellectual
210,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,life--there is no period so important as the years between three and
211,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"six, and none so fruitful. To put in the seed at that time is, as a"
212,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"rule, to decide the kind of harvest the child will reap later; whether"
213,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"he shall be a shrewd, keen, clever, ambitious man, with a hard,"
214,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"mechanical mind, bent on getting the best of the world; or a generous,"
215,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"fruitful, open-minded man, intent on living the fullest life in mind"
216,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"and heart. No apology is offered for giving large space to myths,"
217,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"legends, fairy stories, tales of all sorts, and to poetry; for in"
218,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,these expressions of the creative mind is to be found the material on
219,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"which the imagination has fed in every age and which is, for the most"
220,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"part, conspicuously absent from our educational programmes."
221,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
222,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"America has at present greater facility in producing ""smart"" men than"
223,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"in producing able men; the alert, quick-witted, money-maker abounds,"
224,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"but the men who live with ideas, who care for the principles"
225,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"of things, and who make life rich in resource and interest are"
226,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,comparatively few. America needs poetry more than it needs industrial
227,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,training; though the two ought never to be separated. The time to
228,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"awaken the imagination, which is the creative faculty, is early"
229,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,childhood; and the most accessible material for this education is the
230,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"literature which the race created in its childhood. The creative man,"
231,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"whether in the arts or in practical affairs, in poetry, in engineering"
232,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"or in business, is always the man of imagination."
233,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
234,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,In this library for young people the attempt has been made not only
235,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,to give the child what it needs but in the form which is most easily
236,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,understood. For this reason some well-known stories have been
237,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,retold in simpler English than their classic forms present. This is
238,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,especially true of many tales for any young children reprinted by
239,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"special arrangement from recent English sources. In some cases, where"
240,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,the substance has seemed of more importance to the child than the
241,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"form, simpler words and forms of expression have been substituted for"
242,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"more complex or abstract phrases, and passages of minor importance"
243,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,have been condensed or omitted.
244,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
245,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,The aim in making the selections in this set of books has been to
246,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,interest the child and give it what it needs for normal growth; the
247,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,material has been taken from many sources old and new; much of the
248,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"reading matter presented has been familiar in one form or another, to"
249,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,generations of children; much has appeared for the first time within
250,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,the last ten years; a considerable part has been prepared especially
251,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,for the Treasury and a large part has been selected from the best
252,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,writing in the various fields.
253,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,
254,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,"It is the hope of the Editor that this ""Treasury"" or ""Library"" will"
255,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,justify its title by its real and fundamental service to children and
256,GENERAL INTRODUCTION,parents alike.

265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,Since this series of books is intended for all young people from one
267,INTRODUCTION,"to one hundred, it opens with about eighty of the old MOTHER GOOSE"
268,INTRODUCTION,RHYMES. Nothing better was ever invented to tell to little folks who
269,INTRODUCTION,"are young enough for lullabies. Their rhythm, their humor, and their"
270,INTRODUCTION,pith will always cause us to prize them as the Babies' Classics.
271,INTRODUCTION,
272,INTRODUCTION,"Next come a score of the most famous NURSERY TALES, the kind that"
273,INTRODUCTION,"children cry for and love to hear fifty times over. And since, just"
274,INTRODUCTION,"as soon as little folks like stories they love to hear them in rhyme,"
275,INTRODUCTION,here are forty CHILDREN'S FAVORITE POEMS.
276,INTRODUCTION,
277,INTRODUCTION,"What would young life be without ""Puss in Boots"" and ""Little Red"
278,INTRODUCTION,"Riding Hood"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty""? Our TREASURY would indeed be"
279,INTRODUCTION,"poor without them, so these FAVORITE STORIES come next, yoked"
280,INTRODUCTION,"with some OLD-FASHIONED POEMS in story-form, as ""The Night before"
281,INTRODUCTION,"Christmas,"" ""The Wonderful World,"" and ""Little Orphant Annie."" All who"
282,INTRODUCTION,"love pets and animals have always liked FABLES, so here are the noted"
283,INTRODUCTION,"parables of Æsop, and the lesser-known but even more jolly tales from"
284,INTRODUCTION,East Indian sources.
285,INTRODUCTION,
286,INTRODUCTION,"The fairy-tale age is supposed to come from four to nine, but the"
287,INTRODUCTION,"editors are sure it lasts much longer than that. However this may be,"
288,INTRODUCTION,the better half of our first volume is given up to FAIRY TALES AND
289,INTRODUCTION,LAUGHTER STORIES from all over the world.
290,INTRODUCTION,
291,INTRODUCTION,"It ends with TALES FOR TINY TOTS, the kind that mother reads beside"
292,INTRODUCTION,"the fire at bedtime, some of them old, like the ""Little Red Hen"" and"
293,INTRODUCTION,"""Peter Rabbit,"" and some of them newer, like ""The Greedy Brownie"" and"
294,INTRODUCTION,"""The Birthday Honors of the Fairy Queen."""

1897,THE THREE BEARS,
1898,THE THREE BEARS,
1899,THE THREE BEARS,Little Goldilocks was a pretty girl who lived once upon a time in a
1900,THE THREE BEARS,far-off country.
1901,THE THREE BEARS,
1902,THE THREE BEARS,"One day she was sitting on the hearthrug playing with her two kittens,"
1903,THE THREE BEARS,"and you would have thought she was as happy as a queen, and quite"
1904,THE THREE BEARS,contented to stay where she was instead of wanting to run about the
1905,THE THREE BEARS,world meddling with other people's property. But it happened that she
1906,THE THREE BEARS,"was rather a mischievous little maid, and could not resist teasing her"
1907,THE THREE BEARS,"pets, so one of them scratched her, and then she would play with them"
1908,THE THREE BEARS,no longer.
1909,THE THREE BEARS,
1910,THE THREE BEARS,"She got up and trotted away into the wood behind her mother's house,"
1911,THE THREE BEARS,"and it was such a warm, pleasant day that she wandered on and on until"
1912,THE THREE BEARS,she came into a part of the wood where she had never been before.
1913,THE THREE BEARS,
1914,THE THREE BEARS,"Now, in this wood there lived a family of three Bears. The first was"
1915,THE THREE BEARS,"a GREAT BIG BEAR, the second was a MIDDLING-SIZED BEAR, and the third"
1916,THE THREE BEARS,"was a LITTLE TEENY TINY BEAR, and they all lived together in a funny"
1917,THE THREE BEARS,"little house, and very happy they were."
1918,THE THREE BEARS,
1919,THE THREE BEARS,"Goldilocks stopped when she came to the Bears' house, and began to"
1920,THE THREE BEARS,wonder who lived there.
1921,THE THREE BEARS,
1922,THE THREE BEARS,"""I'll just look in and see,"" she said, and so she did; but there"
1923,THE THREE BEARS,"was no one there, for the Bears had all gone out for a morning walk,"
1924,THE THREE BEARS,whilst the soup they were going to have for dinner cooled upon the
1925,THE THREE BEARS,table.
1926,THE THREE BEARS,
1927,THE THREE BEARS,"Goldilocks was rather hungry after her walk, and the soup smelt so"
1928,THE THREE BEARS,good that she began to wish the people of the house would come home
1929,THE THREE BEARS,"and invite her to have some. But although she looked everywhere, under"
1930,THE THREE BEARS,"the table and into the cupboards, she could find no one, and at last"
1931,THE THREE BEARS,"she could resist no longer, but made up her mind to take just a little"
1932,THE THREE BEARS,sip to see how the soup tasted. The soup had been put into three
1933,THE THREE BEARS,"bowls--a Great Big Bowl for the Great Big Bear, a Middling-sized Bowl"
1934,THE THREE BEARS,"for the Middling-sized Bear, and a Teeny Tiny Bowl for the Teeny Tiny"
1935,THE THREE BEARS,"Bear; beside each bowl lay a spoon, and Goldilocks took one and helped"
1936,THE THREE BEARS,herself to a spoonful of soup from the Great Big Bowl.
1937,THE THREE BEARS,
1938,THE THREE BEARS,Ugh! how it burnt her mouth; it was so hot with pepper that she did
1939,THE THREE BEARS,"not like it at all; still, she was very hungry, so she thought she"
1940,THE THREE BEARS,would try again.
1941,THE THREE BEARS,
1942,THE THREE BEARS,"This time she took a sip of the Middling-sized Bear's soup, but she"
1943,THE THREE BEARS,"liked that no better, for it was too salt. But when she tasted the"
1944,THE THREE BEARS,Teeny Tiny Bear's soup it was just as she liked it; so she ate it up
1945,THE THREE BEARS,"every drop, without thinking twice about it."
1946,THE THREE BEARS,
1947,THE THREE BEARS,When she had finished her dinner she noticed three chairs standing by
1948,THE THREE BEARS,"the wall. One was a Great Big Chair, and she climbed upon that and sat"
1949,THE THREE BEARS,"down. Oh, dear! how hard it was! She was sure she could not sit"
1950,THE THREE BEARS,"there for long, so she climbed up on the next, which was only a"
1951,THE THREE BEARS,"Middling-sized Chair, but that was too soft for her taste; so she went"
1952,THE THREE BEARS,"on to the last, which was a Teeny Tiny Chair and suited her exactly."
1953,THE THREE BEARS,
1954,THE THREE BEARS,"It was so comfortable that she sat on and on until, if you'll"
1955,THE THREE BEARS,"believe it, she actually sat the bottom out. Then, of course, she"
1956,THE THREE BEARS,"was comfortable no longer, so she got up and began to wonder what she"
1957,THE THREE BEARS,should do next.
1958,THE THREE BEARS,
1959,THE THREE BEARS,"There was a staircase in the Bears' house, and Goldilocks thought she"
1960,THE THREE BEARS,"would go up it and see where it led to. So up she went, and when she"
1961,THE THREE BEARS,"reached the top she laughed outright, for the Bears' bedroom was the"
1962,THE THREE BEARS,funniest she had ever seen. In the middle of the room stood a Great
1963,THE THREE BEARS,"Big Bed, on one side of it there was a Middling-sized Bed, and on the"
1964,THE THREE BEARS,other side there was a Teeny Tiny Bed.
1965,THE THREE BEARS,
1966,THE THREE BEARS,"Goldilocks was sleepy, so she thought she would lie down and have a"
1967,THE THREE BEARS,"little nap. First she got upon the Great Big Bed, but it was just as"
1968,THE THREE BEARS,hard as the Great Big Chair had been; so she jumped off and tried the
1969,THE THREE BEARS,"Middling-sized Bed, but it was so soft that she sank right down into"
1970,THE THREE BEARS,the feather cushions and was nearly smothered.
1971,THE THREE BEARS,
1972,THE THREE BEARS,"""I will try the Teeny Tiny Bed,"" she said, and so she did, and it was"
1973,THE THREE BEARS,so comfortable that she soon fell fast asleep.

1975,THE THREE BEARS,"Whilst she lay there, dreaming of all sorts of pleasant things, the"

1989,THE THREE BEARS,down his Teeny Tiny Face.
1990,THE THREE BEARS,
1991,THE THREE BEARS,"When the Great Big Bear went to sit down in his Great Big Chair, he"

2049,CINDERELLA,Once upon a time there lived a noble gentleman who had one dear little
2050,CINDERELLA,"daughter. Poor child! her own kind mother was dead, and her father,"
2051,CINDERELLA,"who loved her very dearly, was afraid that his little girl was"
2052,CINDERELLA,sometimes lonely. So he married a grand lady who had two daughters
2053,CINDERELLA,"of her own, and who, he thought, would be kind and good to his little"
2054,CINDERELLA,one. But no sooner did the stepmother enter her new home than she
2055,CINDERELLA,began to show her true character. Her stepdaughter was so much
2056,CINDERELLA,"prettier and sweeter than her own children, that she was jealous of"
2057,CINDERELLA,"her, and gave her all the hard work of the house to do, whilst the two"
2058,CINDERELLA,proud sisters spent their time at pleasant parties and entertainments.
2059,CINDERELLA,
2060,CINDERELLA,The only pleasure the poor child had was to spend her evenings sitting
2061,CINDERELLA,"in the chimney-corner, resting her weary limbs, and for this reason"
2062,CINDERELLA,"her sisters mockingly nicknamed her ""Cinderella."" The sisters' fine"
2063,CINDERELLA,"clothes made Cinderella feel very shabby; but, in her little torn"
2064,CINDERELLA,"frock and ragged shoes, she was a thousand times more lovely than"
2065,CINDERELLA,they.
2066,CINDERELLA,
2067,CINDERELLA,"Now, it chanced that the King's son gave a grand ball, to which he"
2068,CINDERELLA,"invited all the lords and ladies in the country, and, amongst the"
2069,CINDERELLA,"rest, Cinderella's two sisters were asked. How pleased and excited"
2070,CINDERELLA,they were when the invitation arrived! For days they could talk of
2071,CINDERELLA,nothing but the clothes they should wear and the grand folk they hoped
2072,CINDERELLA,to meet.
2073,CINDERELLA,
2074,CINDERELLA,"When at last the great day arrived, Cinderella was kept running about"
2075,CINDERELLA,"from early till late, decking the sisters, and dressing their hair."
2076,CINDERELLA,
2077,CINDERELLA,"""Don't you wish you were going to the ball?"" said one of them."
2078,CINDERELLA,
2079,CINDERELLA,"""Indeed I do,"" sighed the poor little maid. The sisters burst out"
2080,CINDERELLA,"laughing. ""A pretty spectacle _you_ would be,"" they said rudely. ""Go"
2081,CINDERELLA,"back to your cinders--they are fit company for rags."" Then, stepping"
2082,CINDERELLA,carefully into their carriage so that they might not crush their fine
2083,CINDERELLA,"clothes, they drove away to the ball."
2084,CINDERELLA,
2085,CINDERELLA,"Cinderella went back to her chimney-corner, and tried not to feel"
2086,CINDERELLA,"envious, but the tears _would_ gather in the pretty eyes, and trickle"
2087,CINDERELLA,down the sorrowful little face.
2088,CINDERELLA,
2089,CINDERELLA,"""What are you crying for, child?"" cried a silvery voice."
2090,CINDERELLA,
2091,CINDERELLA,"Cinderella started, and raised her eyes. Who could it be? Then in a"
2092,CINDERELLA,moment she knew--it was her fairy Godmother!
2093,CINDERELLA,
2094,CINDERELLA,"""I do so want----"" began Cinderella; then her sobs stopped her."
2095,CINDERELLA,
2096,CINDERELLA,"""To go to the ball,"" finished the Godmother. Cinderella nodded. ""Well,"
2097,CINDERELLA,"leave off crying--be a good girl, and you shall go. Run quickly into"
2098,CINDERELLA,"the garden, and bring the largest pumpkin you can find."""
2099,CINDERELLA,
2100,CINDERELLA,Cinderella could not imagine how a pumpkin could help her to go to the
2101,CINDERELLA,"ball, but her only thought was to obey her Godmother. In a few moments"
2102,CINDERELLA,"she was back again, with a splendid pumpkin. Her Godmother scooped out"
2103,CINDERELLA,"the inside--one touch of the wand, and the pumpkin was a golden coach,"
2104,CINDERELLA,lined with white satin.
2105,CINDERELLA,
2106,CINDERELLA,"""Now, godchild, quick--the mouse-trap from the pantry!"""
2107,CINDERELLA,
2108,CINDERELLA,"""Here it is, Godmother,"" said Cinderella breathlessly."
2109,CINDERELLA,
2110,CINDERELLA,One by one six fat sleek mice passed through the trap door. As each
2111,CINDERELLA,"appeared, a touch of the wand transformed it into a cream-colored"
2112,CINDERELLA,"horse, fit for a queen."
2113,CINDERELLA,
2114,CINDERELLA,"""Now, Cinderella, can you find a coachman?"""
2115,CINDERELLA,
2116,CINDERELLA,"""There is a large gray rat in the rat-trap--would he do, Godmother?"""
2117,CINDERELLA,
2118,CINDERELLA,"""Run and fetch him, child, and then I can judge,"" So Cinderella ran to"
2119,CINDERELLA,"fetch the rat, and her Godmother said he was just made for a coachman;"
2120,CINDERELLA,and I think you would have agreed with her had you seen him a moment
2121,CINDERELLA,"later, with his powdered wig and silk stockings."
2122,CINDERELLA,
2123,CINDERELLA,Six lizards from behind the pumpkin-frame became six footmen in
2124,CINDERELLA,splendid liveries--you would have thought they had been footmen all
2125,CINDERELLA,their lives. Cinderella was so excited that she could scarcely speak.
2126,CINDERELLA,
2127,CINDERELLA,"""Oh! Godmother,"" she cried, ""it is all so lovely!"" Then suddenly she"
2128,CINDERELLA,"thought of her shabby frock. ""There is my white muslin,"" she said"
2129,CINDERELLA,"wistfully, ""if--do you think----"""
2130,CINDERELLA,
2131,CINDERELLA,"But before Cinderella could realize what was happening, her"
2132,CINDERELLA,"Godmother's wand tapped her lightly on the shoulder, and in place of"
2133,CINDERELLA,"the shabby frock, there was a gleam of satin, silver, and pearls."
2134,CINDERELLA,
2135,CINDERELLA,"Ah! who can describe a robe made by the fairies? It was white as snow,"
2136,CINDERELLA,"and as dazzling; round the hem hung a fringe of diamonds, sparkling"
2137,CINDERELLA,like dew-drops in the sunshine. The lace about the throat and arms
2138,CINDERELLA,could only have been spun by fairy spiders. Surely it was a dream!
2139,CINDERELLA,"Cinderella put her daintily-gloved hand to her throat, and softly"
2140,CINDERELLA,touched the pearls that encircled her neck.
2141,CINDERELLA,
2142,CINDERELLA,"""Come, child,"" said the Godmother, ""or you will be late."""
2143,CINDERELLA,
2144,CINDERELLA,"As Cinderella moved, the firelight shone upon her dainty shoes."
2145,CINDERELLA,
2146,CINDERELLA,"""They are of diamonds,"" she said."
2147,CINDERELLA,
2148,CINDERELLA,"""No,"" answered her Godmother, smiling; ""they are better than"
2149,CINDERELLA,"that--they are of glass, made by the fairies. And now, child, go, and"
2150,CINDERELLA,"enjoy yourself to your heart's content. Only remember, if you stay at"
2151,CINDERELLA,"the palace one instant after midnight, your coach and servants will"
2152,CINDERELLA,"vanish, and you will be the little gray Cinderella once more!"""
2153,CINDERELLA,
2154,CINDERELLA,"A few moments later, the coach dashed into the royal courtyard, the"
2155,CINDERELLA,"door was flung open, and Cinderella alighted. As she walked slowly up"
2156,CINDERELLA,"the richly-carpeted staircase, there was a murmur of admiration, and"
2157,CINDERELLA,"the King's son hastened to meet her. ""Never,"" said he to himself,"
2158,CINDERELLA,"""have I seen anyone so lovely!"" He led her into the ball-room, where"
2159,CINDERELLA,"the King, who was much taken with her sweet face and pretty, modest"
2160,CINDERELLA,"manners, whispered to the Queen that she must surely be a foreign"
2161,CINDERELLA,Princess.
2162,CINDERELLA,
2163,CINDERELLA,"The evening passed away in a dream of delight, Cinderella dancing with"
2164,CINDERELLA,"no one but the handsome young Prince, and being waited on by his own"
2165,CINDERELLA,hands at supper-time. The two sisters could not recognize their ragged
2166,CINDERELLA,little sister in the beautiful and graceful lady to whom the Prince
2167,CINDERELLA,"paid so much attention, and felt quite pleased and flattered when she"
2168,CINDERELLA,addressed a few words to them.
2169,CINDERELLA,
2170,CINDERELLA,"Presently a clock chimed the three quarters past eleven, and,"
2171,CINDERELLA,"remembering her Godmother's warning, Cinderella at once took leave of"
2172,CINDERELLA,"the Prince, and, jumping into her coach, was driven rapidly home. Here"
2173,CINDERELLA,"she found her Godmother waiting to hear all about the ball. ""It was"
2174,CINDERELLA,"_lovely_,"" said Cinderella; ""and oh! Godmother, there is to be another"
2175,CINDERELLA,"to-morrow night, and I _should_ so much like to go to it!"""
2176,CINDERELLA,
2177,CINDERELLA,"""Then you shall,"" replied the kind fairy, and, kissing her godchild"
2178,CINDERELLA,"tenderly, she vanished. When the sisters returned from the ball, they"
2179,CINDERELLA,"found a sleepy little maiden sitting in the chimney-corner, waiting"
2180,CINDERELLA,for them.
2181,CINDERELLA,
2182,CINDERELLA,"""How late you are!"" cried Cinderella, yawning. ""Are you not very"
2183,CINDERELLA,"tired?"""
2184,CINDERELLA,
2185,CINDERELLA,"""Not in the least,"" they answered, and then they told her what a"
2186,CINDERELLA,"delightful ball it had been, and how the loveliest Princess in the"
2187,CINDERELLA,"world had been there, and had spoken to them, and admired their pretty"
2188,CINDERELLA,dresses.
2189,CINDERELLA,
2190,CINDERELLA,"""Who was she?"" asked Cinderella slyly."
2191,CINDERELLA,
2192,CINDERELLA,"""That we cannot say,"" answered the sisters. ""She would not tell her"
2193,CINDERELLA,"name, though the Prince begged her to do so on bended knee."""
2194,CINDERELLA,
2195,CINDERELLA,"""Dear sister,"" said Cinderella, ""I, too, should like to see the"
2196,CINDERELLA,"beautiful Princess. Will you not lend me your old yellow gown, that I"
2197,CINDERELLA,"may go to the ball to-morrow with you?"""
2198,CINDERELLA,
2199,CINDERELLA,"""What!"" cried her sister angrily; ""lend one of my dresses to a little"
2200,CINDERELLA,"cinder-maid? Don't talk nonsense, child!"""
2201,CINDERELLA,
2202,CINDERELLA,"The next night, the sisters were more particular than ever about their"
2203,CINDERELLA,"attire, but at last they were dressed, and as soon as their carriage"
2204,CINDERELLA,"had driven away, the Godmother appeared. Once more she touched her"
2205,CINDERELLA,"godchild with her wand, and in a moment she was arrayed in a beautiful"
2206,CINDERELLA,dress that seemed as though it had been woven of moon-beams and
2207,CINDERELLA,"sunshine, so radiantly did it gleam and shimmer. She put her arms"
2208,CINDERELLA,"round her Godmother's neck and kissed and thanked her. ""Goodbye,"
2209,CINDERELLA,"childie; enjoy yourself, but whatever you do, remember to leave"
2210,CINDERELLA,"the ball before the clock strikes twelve,"" the Godmother said, and"
2211,CINDERELLA,Cinderella promised.
2212,CINDERELLA,
2213,CINDERELLA,But the hours flew by so happily and so swiftly that Cinderella forgot
2214,CINDERELLA,"her promise, until she happened to look at a clock and saw that it was"
2215,CINDERELLA,"on the stroke of twelve. With a cry of alarm she fled from the room,"
2216,CINDERELLA,"dropping, in her haste, one of the little glass slippers; but, with"
2217,CINDERELLA,"the sound of the clock strokes in her ears, she dared not wait to pick"
2218,CINDERELLA,"it up. The Prince hurried after her in alarm, but when he reached the"
2219,CINDERELLA,"entrance hall, the beautiful Princess had vanished, and there was no"
2220,CINDERELLA,one to be seen but a forlorn little beggar-maid creeping away into the
2221,CINDERELLA,darkness.
2222,CINDERELLA,
2223,CINDERELLA,"Poor little Cinderella!--she hurried home through the dark streets,"
2224,CINDERELLA,"weary, and overwhelmed with shame."
2225,CINDERELLA,
2226,CINDERELLA,"The fire was out when she reached her home, and there was no Godmother"
2227,CINDERELLA,waiting to receive her; but she sat down in the chimney-corner to wait
2228,CINDERELLA,her sisters' return. When they came in they could speak of nothing but
2229,CINDERELLA,the wonderful things that had happened at the ball.
2230,CINDERELLA,
2231,CINDERELLA,"The beautiful Princess had been there again, they said, but had"
2232,CINDERELLA,"disappeared just as the clock struck twelve, and though the Prince had"
2233,CINDERELLA,"searched everywhere for her, he had been unable to find her. ""He was"
2234,CINDERELLA,"quite beside himself with grief,"" said the elder sister, ""for there is"
2235,CINDERELLA,"no doubt he hoped to make her his bride."""
2236,CINDERELLA,
2237,CINDERELLA,"Cinderella listened in silence to all they had to say, and, slipping"
2238,CINDERELLA,"her hand into her pocket, felt that the one remaining glass slipper"
2239,CINDERELLA,"was safe, for it was the only thing of all her grand apparel that"
2240,CINDERELLA,remained to her.
2241,CINDERELLA,
2242,CINDERELLA,On the following morning there was a great noise of trumpets and
2243,CINDERELLA,"drums, and a procession passed through the town, at the head of"
2244,CINDERELLA,"which rode the King's son. Behind him came a herald, bearing a velvet"
2245,CINDERELLA,"cushion, upon which rested a little glass slipper. The herald blew a"
2246,CINDERELLA,"blast upon the trumpet, and then read a proclamation saying that the"
2247,CINDERELLA,King's son would wed any lady in the land who could fit the slipper
2248,CINDERELLA,"upon her foot, if she could produce another to match it."
2249,CINDERELLA,
2250,CINDERELLA,"Of course, the sisters tried to squeeze their feet into the slipper,"
2251,CINDERELLA,but it was of no use--they were much too large. Then Cinderella shyly
2252,CINDERELLA,begged that she might try. How the sisters laughed with scorn when the
2253,CINDERELLA,Prince knelt to fit the slipper on the cinder-maid's foot; but what
2254,CINDERELLA,"was their surprise when it slipped on with the greatest ease, and the"
2255,CINDERELLA,next moment Cinderella produced the other from her pocket. Once more
2256,CINDERELLA,"she stood in the slippers, and once more the sisters saw before them"
2257,CINDERELLA,the lovely Princess who was to be the Prince's bride. For at the touch
2258,CINDERELLA,"of the magic shoes, the little gray frock disappeared for ever, and in"
2259,CINDERELLA,place of it she wore the beautiful robe the fairy Godmother had given
2260,CINDERELLA,to her.
2261,CINDERELLA,
2262,CINDERELLA,The sisters hung their heads with sorrow and vexation; but kind little
2263,CINDERELLA,"Cinderella put her arms round their necks, kissed them, and forgave"
2264,CINDERELLA,"them for all their unkindness, so that they could not help but love"
2265,CINDERELLA,her.
2266,CINDERELLA,
2267,CINDERELLA,"The Prince could not bear to part from his little love again, so"
2268,CINDERELLA,"he carried her back to the palace in his grand coach, and they were"
2269,CINDERELLA,married that very day. Cinderella's stepsisters were present at the
2270,CINDERELLA,"feast, but in the place of honor sat the fairy Godmother."
2271,CINDERELLA,
2272,CINDERELLA,"So the poor little cinder-maid married the Prince, and in time they"
2273,CINDERELLA,"came to be King and Queen, and lived happily ever after."

2285,THE THREE BROTHERS,"his death; but their father was just as fond of one as of the other,"
2286,THE THREE BROTHERS,and did not know how to treat them all fairly. He did not want to sell
2287,THE THREE BROTHERS,"the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, or he might"
2288,THE THREE BROTHERS,have divided the money between them.
2289,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2290,THE THREE BROTHERS,"At last an idea came into his head, and he said to his sons: ""Go out"
2291,THE THREE BROTHERS,"into the world, and each learn a trade, and when you come home, the"
2292,THE THREE BROTHERS,"one who makes best use of his handicraft shall have the house."""
2293,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2294,THE THREE BROTHERS,"The sons were quite content with this plan, and the eldest decided"
2295,THE THREE BROTHERS,"to be a farrier, the second a barber, and the third a fencing master."
2296,THE THREE BROTHERS,"They fixed a time when they would all meet at home again, and then"
2297,THE THREE BROTHERS,they set off.
2298,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2299,THE THREE BROTHERS,It so happened that they each found a clever master with whom they
2300,THE THREE BROTHERS,"learned their business thoroughly. The farrier shod the King's horses,"
2301,THE THREE BROTHERS,"and he thought, ""I shall certainly be the one to have the house."""
2302,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2303,THE THREE BROTHERS,"The barber shaved nobody but grand gentlemen, so he thought it would"
2304,THE THREE BROTHERS,fall to him.
2305,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2306,THE THREE BROTHERS,"The fencing master got many blows, but he set his teeth, and would not"
2307,THE THREE BROTHERS,"let himself be put out, because he thought, ""If I am afraid of a blow,"
2308,THE THREE BROTHERS,"I shall never get the house."""
2309,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2310,THE THREE BROTHERS,"Now, when the given time had passed, they all went home together to"
2311,THE THREE BROTHERS,their father; but they did not know how to get a good opportunity of
2312,THE THREE BROTHERS,"showing off their powers, and sat down to discuss the matter."
2313,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2314,THE THREE BROTHERS,Suddenly a hare came running over the field.
2315,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2316,THE THREE BROTHERS,"""Ah!"" cried the barber, ""she comes just in the nick of time."""
2317,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2318,THE THREE BROTHERS,"He took up his bowl and his soap, and got his lather by the time the"
2319,THE THREE BROTHERS,"hare came quite close, then he soaped her and shaved her as she raced"
2320,THE THREE BROTHERS,"along, without giving her a cut or missing a single hair. His father,"
2321,THE THREE BROTHERS,"astonished, said: ""If the others don't look out, the house will be"
2322,THE THREE BROTHERS,"yours."""
2323,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2324,THE THREE BROTHERS,Before long a gentleman came along in his carriage at full gallop.
2325,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2326,THE THREE BROTHERS,"""Now, father, you shall see what I can do,"" said the farrier and he"
2327,THE THREE BROTHERS,ran after the carriage and tore the four shoes off the horse as he
2328,THE THREE BROTHERS,"galloped along, then, without stopping a second, shod him with new"
2329,THE THREE BROTHERS,ones.
2330,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2331,THE THREE BROTHERS,"""You are a fine fellow, indeed,"" said his father. ""You know your"
2332,THE THREE BROTHERS,business as well as your brother. I don't know which I shall give the
2333,THE THREE BROTHERS,"house to at this rate."""
2334,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2335,THE THREE BROTHERS,"Then the third one said: ""Let me have a chance, too, father."""
2336,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2337,THE THREE BROTHERS,"As it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword and swirled it round"
2338,THE THREE BROTHERS,"and round his head, so that not a drop fell on him. Even when the rain"
2339,THE THREE BROTHERS,"grew heavier, so heavy that it seemed as if it were being poured from"
2340,THE THREE BROTHERS,"the sky out of buckets, he swung the sword faster and faster, and"
2341,THE THREE BROTHERS,remained as dry as if he had been under a roof.
2342,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2343,THE THREE BROTHERS,"His father was amazed, and said: ""You have done the best; the house is"
2344,THE THREE BROTHERS,"yours."""
2345,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2346,THE THREE BROTHERS,"Both the other brothers were quite satisfied with this decision, and"
2347,THE THREE BROTHERS,"as they were all so devoted to one another, they lived together in"
2348,THE THREE BROTHERS,"the house, and carried on their trades, by which they made plenty of"
2349,THE THREE BROTHERS,"money, since they were so perfect in them."
2350,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2351,THE THREE BROTHERS,"They lived happily together to a good old age, and when one fell ill"
2352,THE THREE BROTHERS,"and died, the others grieved so much over him that they pined away and"
2353,THE THREE BROTHERS,soon after departed this life.
2354,THE THREE BROTHERS,
2355,THE THREE BROTHERS,"Then, as they had been so fond of one another, they were all buried in"
2356,THE THREE BROTHERS,one grave.

2364,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2365,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2366,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"One summer's day the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and"
2367,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the bear heard a bird singing very sweetly, and said: ""Brother Wolf,"
2368,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"what kind of bird is that which is singing so delightfully?"""
2369,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2370,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""That is the King of the birds, before whom we must do reverence,"""
2371,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,replied the wolf; but it was only the wren.
2372,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2373,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""If that be so,"" said the bear, ""I should like to see his royal"
2374,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"palace; come, lead me to it."" ""That cannot be as you like,"" replied"
2375,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the wolf. ""You must wait till the Queen returns."" Soon afterward the"
2376,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"Queen arrived with some food in her bill, and the King, too, to feed"
2377,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"their young ones, and the bear would have gone off to see them, but"
2378,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the wolf, pulling his ear, said: ""No, you must wait till the Queen and"
2379,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the King are both off again."""
2380,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2381,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"So, after observing well the situation of the nest, the two tramped"
2382,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"off, but the bear had no rest, for he wished still to see the royal"
2383,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"palace, and after a short delay he set off to it again. He found the"
2384,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"King and Queen absent, and, peeping into the nest, he saw five or six"
2385,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"young birds lying in it. ""Is this the royal palace?"" exclaimed the"
2386,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"bear; ""this miserable place! You are no King's children, but wretched"
2387,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"young vagabonds."" ""No, no, that we are not!"" burst out the little"
2388,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"wrens together in a great passion, for to them this speech was"
2389,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"addressed. ""No, no, we are born of honorable parents, and you, Mr."
2390,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"Bear, shall make your words good!"" At this speech the bear and the"
2391,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"wolf were much frightened, and ran back to their holes; but the little"
2392,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"wrens kept up an unceasing, clamor till their parents' return. As soon"
2393,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"as they came back with food in their mouths the little birds began,"
2394,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""We will none of us touch a fly's leg, but will starve rather, until"
2395,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"you decide whether we are fine and handsome children or not, for the"
2396,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"bear has been here and insulted us!"""
2397,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2398,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""Be quiet,"" replied the King, ""and that shall soon be settled."" And"
2399,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"thereupon he flew with his Queen to the residence of the bear, and"
2400,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"called to him from the entrance, ""Old grumbler, why have you insulted"
2401,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"my children? That shall cost you dear, for we will decide the matter"
2402,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"by a pitched battle."""
2403,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2404,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"War having thus been declared against the bear, all the four-footed"
2405,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"beasts were summoned: the ox, the ass, the cow, the goat, the stag,"
2406,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"and every animal on the face of the earth. The wren, on the other"
2407,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"hand, summoned every flying thing; not only the birds, great and"
2408,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"small, but also the gnat, the hornet, the bee, and the flies."
2409,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2410,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"When the time arrived for the commencement of the war, the wren King"
2411,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,sent out spies to see who was appointed commander-in-chief of
2412,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the enemy. The gnat was the most cunning of all the army, and he,"
2413,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"therefore, buzzed away into the forest where the enemy was encamped,"
2414,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,and alighted on a leaf of the tree beneath which the watchword was
2415,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"given out. There stood the bear and called the fox to him, and said:"
2416,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""You are the most crafty of animals, so you must be general, and lead"
2417,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"us on."" ""Well,"" said the fox, ""but what sign shall we appoint?"" Nobody"
2418,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"answered. Then the fox said: ""I have a fine long bushy tail, which"
2419,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,looks like a red feather at a distance; if I hold this tail straight
2420,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"up, all is going well and you must march after me; but if I suffer it"
2421,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"to hang down, run away as fast as you can."" As soon as the gnat heard"
2422,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,all this she flew home and told the wren King everything to a hair.
2423,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2424,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"When the day arrived for the battle to begin, the four-footed beasts"
2425,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"all came running along to the field, shaking the earth with their"
2426,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"roaring and bellowing. The wren King also came with his army, whirring"
2427,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,and buzzing and humming enough to terrify any one out of his senses.
2428,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,Then the wren King sent the hornet forward to settle upon the fox's
2429,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,tail and sting it with all his power. As soon as the fox felt the
2430,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"first sting he drew up his hind leg with the pain, still carrying,"
2431,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"however, his tail as high in the air as before; at the second sting"
2432,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,he was obliged to drop it a little bit; but at the third he could
2433,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"no longer bear the pain, but was forced to drop his tail between his"
2434,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"legs. As soon as the other beasts saw this, they thought all was lost,"
2435,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,and began to run each one to his own hole; so the birds won the battle
2436,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,without difficulty.
2437,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2438,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,When all was over the wren King and his Queen flew home to their
2439,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"children, and cried out: ""Rejoice! rejoice! we have won the battle;"
2440,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"now eat and drink as much as you please."""
2441,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2442,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"The young wrens, however, said: ""Still we will not eat till the bear"
2443,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"has come to our nest and begged pardon, and admitted that we are fine"
2444,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"and handsome children."""
2445,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2446,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"So the wren King flew back to the cave of the bear, and called out,"
2447,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"""Old grumbler, you must come to the nest and beg pardon of my children"
2448,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"for calling them wretched young brats, else your ribs shall be crushed"
2449,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"in your body!"""
2450,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,
2451,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,In great terror the bear crept out and begged pardon; and afterward
2452,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"the young wrens, being now made happy in their minds, settled down to"
2453,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,"eating and drinking, and I am afraid they were over-excited and kept"
2454,THE WREN AND THE BEAR,up their merriment far too late.

2615,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2616,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2617,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"There once lived in Japan a rat and his wife, folk of noble race, who"
2618,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"had one beautiful daughter. They were exceedingly proud of her charms,"
2619,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"and dreamed, as parents will, of the grand marriage she was sure"
2620,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"to make in time. Proud of his pure rodent blood, the father saw no"
2621,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"son-in-law more to be desired than a young rat of ancient lineage,"
2622,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"whose attentions to his daughter were very marked. This match,"
2623,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"however, brilliant as it was, seemed not to the mother's taste. Like"
2624,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"many people who think themselves made out of special clay, she had a"
2625,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"very poor opinion of her own kind, and was ambitious for an alliance"
2626,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"with the highest circles. To the stars! was her motto, she always"
2627,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"said, and really, when one has a daughter of incomparable beauty, one"
2628,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,may well hope for an equally incomparable son-in-law.
2629,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2630,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Address yourself to the sun at once, then,"" cried the impatient"
2631,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"father one day; ""there is nothing above him, surely."""
2632,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2633,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Quite so; I had already thought of it,"" she answered, ""and since you,"
2634,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"too, are in sympathy with the idea, we will make our call to-morrow."""
2635,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2636,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"So, on the following morning the proud father and the haughty"
2637,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,mother-rat went together to present their lovely daughter to the orb
2638,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,of day.
2639,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2640,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Lord Sun,"" said the mother, ""let me present our only daughter, who"
2641,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,is so beautiful that there is nothing like her in the whole world.
2642,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"Naturally we desire a son-in-law as wonderful as she, and, as you see,"
2643,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"we have come to you first of all."""
2644,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2645,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Really,"" said the sun, ""I am extremely flattered by your proposal,"
2646,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,but you do me too much honor; there is some one greater than I; it is
2647,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"the cloud. Look, if you do not believe.""... And at that moment the"
2648,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"cloud arrived, and with one waft of his folds extinguished the sun"
2649,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,with all his golden rays.
2650,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2651,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Very well; let us speak to the cloud, then,"" said the mother-rat, not"
2652,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,in the least disconcerted.
2653,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2654,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Immensely honored, I am sure,"" replied the cloud in his turn, ""but"
2655,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,you are again mistaken; there is some one greater than I; it is the
2656,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"wind. You shall see."""
2657,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2658,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"At the same moment along came the wind, and with one blow swept the"
2659,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"cloud out of sight, after which, overturning father, mother, and"
2660,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"daughter, he tumbled with them, pell-mell, at the foot of an old wall."
2661,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2662,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Quick, quick,"" cried the mother-rat, struggling to her feet, ""and let"
2663,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"us repeat our compliments to the wind."""
2664,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2665,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""You'd better address yourself to the wall,"" growled the wind roughly."
2666,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""You see very well he is greater than I, for he stops me and makes me"
2667,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"draw back."""
2668,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2669,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,No sooner had she heard these words than mother-rat faced about and
2670,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"presented her daughter to the wall. Ah, but now the fair rat-maiden"
2671,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,imitated the wind; she drew back also. He whom she really adored in
2672,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,her heart of hearts was the fascinating young rat who had paid his
2673,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"court to her so well. However, to please her mother, she had consented"
2674,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"to wed the Sun, in spite of his blinding rays, or the cloud, in spite"
2675,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"of his sulky look, even the wind, in spite of his brusque manner; but"
2676,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"an old, broken wall!... No! death would be better a thousand times."
2677,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2678,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"Fortunately the wall excused himself, like all the rest. ""Certainly,"""
2679,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"he said, ""I can stop the wind, who can sweep away the cloud, who can"
2680,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"cover up the Sun, but there is some one greater than I: it is the rat,"
2681,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"who can pass through my body, and can even, if he chooses, reduce"
2682,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"me to powder with his teeth. Believe me, you need seek no better"
2683,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"son-in-law; greater than the rat, there is nothing in the world."""
2684,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2685,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Do you hear that, wife, do you hear it?"" cried father-rat in triumph."
2686,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Didn't I always say so?"""
2687,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2688,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"""Quite true! you always did,"" returned the mother-rat in wonder, and"
2689,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,suddenly glowed with pride in her ancient name and lineage.
2690,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,
2691,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,"So they all three went home, very happy and contented, and on the"
2692,THE RATS AND THEIR SON-IN-LAW,morrow the lovely rat-maiden married her faithful rat-lover.

2702,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"Once upon a time a little mouse and a little sausage, who loved"
2703,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"each other like sisters, decided to live together, and made their"
2704,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,arrangements in such a way that every day one would go to walk in the

2706,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,keep the house.
2707,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2708,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"One day, when the little sausage had prepared cabbage for dinner,"
2709,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"the little mouse, who had come back from town with a fine appetite,"
2710,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"enjoyed it so greatly that she exclaimed: ""How delicious the cabbage"
2711,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"is to-day, my dear!"""
2712,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2713,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"""Ah!"" answered the little sausage, ""that is because I popped myself"

2715,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2716,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"On the next day, as it was her turn to prepare the meals, the little"
2717,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"mouse said to herself: ""Now I will do as much for my friend as she did"
2718,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"for me; we will have lentils for dinner, and I will jump into the"
2719,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"pot while they are boiling,"" and she let the action follow the word,"
2720,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,without reflecting that a simple sausage can do some things which are
2721,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,out of the reach of even the wisest mouse.
2722,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2723,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"When the sausage came home, she found the house lonely and silent. She"
2724,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"called again and again, ""My little mouse! Mouse of my heart!"" but no"
2725,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,one answered. Then she went to look at the lentils boiling on the
2726,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"stove, and, alas! found within the pot her good little friend, who had"
2727,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,perished at the post of duty.
2728,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2729,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"Poor mousie, with the best intentions in the world, had stayed too"

2731,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,no longer the strength to do so.
2732,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,
2733,THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE,"And the poor sausage could never be consoled! That is why to-day, when"

2743,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2744,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2745,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"There was once a man who had three sons. Johnny, the youngest, was"
2746,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"always looked upon as the simpleton of the family, and had very little"
2747,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,consideration or kindness shown him.
2748,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2749,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,It happened one day that the eldest son was going out into the wood to
2750,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"cut fuel; and before he started, his mother gave him a slice of rich"
2751,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"plum-cake and a flask of wine, so that he might not suffer from hunger"
2752,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,or thirst.
2753,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2754,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Just as he reached the wood, he met a queer old man, dressed in gray,"
2755,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"who wished him ""Good day,"" and begged for a piece of the young man's"
2756,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,cake and a drink of wine.
2757,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2758,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"But the greedy youth replied: ""If I were to give you cake and wine, I"
2759,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"should not have enough left for myself; so be off with you, and leave"
2760,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"me in peace."""
2761,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2762,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,Then he pushed the little man rudely on one side and went his way. He
2763,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"soon came to a likely-looking tree, and began to hew it down, but he"
2764,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"made a false stroke, and instead of striking the tree he buried his"
2765,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"axe in his own arm, and was obliged to hurry home as fast as he could"
2766,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,to have the wound dressed.
2767,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2768,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,And this was what came of offending the little gray man!
2769,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2770,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"The following day the second son set out to the wood, and his mother"
2771,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,treated him just as she had done her eldest son--gave him a slice of
2772,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"cake and a flask of wine, in case he should feel hungry. The little"
2773,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"gray man met him at the entrance to the wood, and begged for a share"
2774,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"of his food, but the young man answered:"
2775,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2776,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""The more I give to you, the less I have for myself. Be off with you."""
2777,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2778,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Then he left the little gray man standing in the road, and went on his"
2779,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"way. But it was not long before he, too, was punished; for the first"
2780,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"stroke he aimed at a tree glanced aside and wounded his leg, so that"
2781,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,he was obliged to be carried home.
2782,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2783,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Then said the Simpleton: ""Father, let me go to the wood for once. _I_"
2784,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"will bring you home plenty of fuel."""
2785,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2786,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Nonsense,"" answered the father. ""Both your brothers have got into"
2787,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"trouble, and it is not likely that I am going to trust you."""
2788,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2789,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"But Johnny would not give up the idea, and worried his father, till at"
2790,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,last he said:
2791,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2792,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Very well, my son, have your own way. You shall learn by experience"
2793,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"that I know better than you."""
2794,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2795,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,There was no rich cake for the simpleton of the family. His mother
2796,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,just gave him a little loaf of dough and a bottle of sour beer.
2797,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2798,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,No sooner did he reach the wood than the little gray man appeared.
2799,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2800,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Give me a piece of your cake and a drink of your wine?"" said he."
2801,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2802,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,But the young man told him he had only a dough loaf and a bottle of
2803,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,sour beer.
2804,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2805,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Still,"" said he, ""you are welcome to a share of the food, such as it"
2806,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"is."""
2807,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2808,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,So the two sat down together; but when Johnny took his humble fare
2809,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"from his pocket, what was his surprise to find it changed into the"
2810,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,most delicious cake and wine. Then the young man and his guest made a
2811,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"hearty meal, and when it was ended the little gray man said:"
2812,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2813,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Because you have such a kind heart, and have willingly shared your"
2814,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"food with me, I am going to reward you. Yonder stands an old tree: hew"
2815,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"it down, and deep in the heart of the roots you will find something."""
2816,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2817,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"The old man then nodded kindly, and disappeared in a moment."
2818,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2819,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Johnny at once did as he had been told, and as soon as the tree fell"
2820,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"he saw, sitting in the midst of the roots, a goose with feathers of"
2821,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"purest gold. He lifted it carefully out, and carried it with him to"
2822,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"the inn, where he meant to spend the night."
2823,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2824,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Now, the landlord had three daughters, and no sooner did they see the"
2825,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"goose than they wanted to know what curious kind of bird it might be,"
2826,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,for never before had they seen a fowl of any kind with feathers of
2827,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,pure gold. The eldest made up her mind to wait for a good opportunity
2828,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,and then pluck a feather for herself. So as soon as Johnny went out
2829,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"of the room she put out her hand and seized the wing of the goose,"
2830,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,but what was her horror to find that she could not unclasp her fingers
2831,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"again, nor even move her hand from the golden goose!"
2832,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2833,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Very soon the second sister came creeping into the room, meaning also"
2834,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"to steal a feather; but no sooner did she touch her sister than she,"
2835,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"too, was unable to draw her hand away."
2836,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2837,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Lastly came the third, anxious to secure a feather before the goose's"
2838,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,master returned.
2839,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2840,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Go away! go away!"" screamed her two sisters, but she could not"
2841,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,understand why she should not help herself as well as the others.
2842,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2843,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"So she paid no heed to their cries, but came toward them and stretched"
2844,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,out her hand to the goose.
2845,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2846,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"In doing so she touched her second sister, and then, alas! she too,"
2847,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,was held fast.
2848,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2849,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"They pulled and tugged with might and main, but it was all of no use;"
2850,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"they could not get away, and there they had to remain the whole night."
2851,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2852,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"The next morning Johnny tucked the goose under his arm, and went on"
2853,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"his way, never troubling himself about the three girls hanging on"
2854,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,behind.
2855,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2856,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Then what a dance he led them: over hedges and ditches, highways and"
2857,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,byways! Wherever he led they were bound to follow. Half way across a
2858,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"sunny meadow, they met the parson, who was terribly shocked to see the"
2859,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,three girls running after a young man.
2860,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2861,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""For shame!"" he cried angrily, and seized the youngest by the hand to"
2862,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,drag her away.
2863,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2864,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"But no sooner did he touch her than the poor parson was made fast too,"
2865,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"and had to run behind the girls, whether he would or no."
2866,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2867,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"They had scarcely gone half a dozen paces before they met the sexton,"
2868,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,who stared with astonishment to see his master running at the heels of
2869,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,the three girls.
2870,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2871,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""Hi! stop, your reverence,"" he cried. ""You will be late for the"
2872,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"christening."""
2873,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2874,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"He seized the parson's sleeve as he ran past him, but the poor sexton"
2875,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,had to join the procession too.
2876,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2877,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"So now there were five of them, and just as they turned a corner the"
2878,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"parson saw two peasants, and called to them to set him and his sexton"
2879,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,free.
2880,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2881,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"They threw down their spades at once and tried to do so, but they too,"
2882,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"stuck fast, and so Johnny had a fine string of seven folk hanging on"
2883,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,to the wing of his golden goose.
2884,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2885,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"On and on they ran, until at length they came into the country of a"
2886,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,powerful King.
2887,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2888,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"This King had an only daughter, who all her life had been so sad that"
2889,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,no one had ever been able to make her laugh. So the King made a decree
2890,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,that the man who could bring a smile to his daughter's face should
2891,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,have her for his bride.
2892,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2893,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"When Johnny heard what the King had promised, he at once made his way"
2894,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"into the Princess's presence, and when she saw the goose, with the"
2895,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"seven queer-looking companions hanging on behind, she burst into such"
2896,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,a hearty fit of laughter that it was thought she would never be able
2897,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,to stop again.
2898,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2899,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Of course, the Simpleton claimed her as his bride, but the King did"
2900,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"not fancy him for a son-in-law, so he made all sorts of excuses."
2901,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2902,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""You shall have her,"" said he, ""if you can first bring me a man who can"
2903,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"drink up a whole cellarful of wine."""
2904,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2905,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"Johnny at once remembered the little gray man, and, feeling sure that"
2906,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"he would help him, he set out for the wood where he had first met him."
2907,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2908,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,When he reached the stump of the old tree which he had himself hewn
2909,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"down, he noticed a man sitting beside it, with a face as gloomy as a"
2910,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,rainy day.
2911,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,

2930,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2931,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,So the young man had no choice but to set out once more for the wood.
2932,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,
2933,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,And again he found a man sitting beside the stump of the tree. He was

2952,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"A third time the Simpleton demanded his bride, but again the King"
2953,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,found an excuse.

2955,JOHNNY AND THE GOLDEN GOOSE,"""First bring me a ship that can sail both on land and sea, and then"

3222,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"""The first is: How many drops of water are there in the sea?"""
3223,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,
3224,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"""My lord King,"" replied the shepherd boy, ""let all the waters be"
3225,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"stopped up on the earth, so that not one drop shall run into the sea"
3226,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"before I count it, and then I will tell you how many drops there are"
3227,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"in the sea!"""
3228,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,
3229,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"""The second question,"" said the King, ""is: How many stars are there in"
3230,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"the sky?"""
3231,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,
3232,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"""Give me a large sheet of paper,"" said the boy; and then he made in it"
3233,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,with a pin so many minute holes that they were far too numerous to see
3234,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"or to count, and dazzled the eyes of whomsoever looked at them. This"
3235,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"done, he said: ""So many stars are there in the sky as there are holes"
3236,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"in this paper; now count them."" But nobody was able. Thereupon the King"
3237,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"said: ""The third question is: How many seconds are there in eternity?"""
3238,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,
3239,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"""In Lower Pomerania is situated the adamantine mountain, one mile in"
3240,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,"height, one mile in breadth, and one mile deep; and thither comes"
3241,THE LITTLE SHEPHERD BOY,a bird once in every thousand years which rubs its beak against the

3255,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3256,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3257,THE THREE SPINNERS,"Once upon a time there was a lazy maiden who would not spin, and, let"
3258,THE THREE SPINNERS,"her mother say what she would, she could not make her do it. At last,"
3259,THE THREE SPINNERS,"the mother, in a fit of impatience, gave her a blow which made the"
3260,THE THREE SPINNERS,girl cry out loudly.
3261,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3262,THE THREE SPINNERS,"At that very instant, the Queen drove by, and, hearing the screams,"
3263,THE THREE SPINNERS,"she stopped the carriage, came into the house, and asked the mother"
3264,THE THREE SPINNERS,why she beat her daughter in such a way that people in passing could
3265,THE THREE SPINNERS,hear the cries.
3266,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3267,THE THREE SPINNERS,Then the mother felt ashamed that her daughter's laziness should be
3268,THE THREE SPINNERS,"known, so she said: ""Oh, your Majesty, I cannot take her away from her"
3269,THE THREE SPINNERS,"spinning: she spins from morning till night, and I am so poor that I"
3270,THE THREE SPINNERS,"cannot afford to buy the flax."""
3271,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3272,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""There is nothing I like better than to hear the sound of spinning,"""
3273,THE THREE SPINNERS,"the Queen replied, ""and nothing pleases me more than the whirl of"
3274,THE THREE SPINNERS,spinning-wheels. Let me take your daughter home with me to the castle;
3275,THE THREE SPINNERS,"I have flax enough, and she may spin there to her heart's content."""
3276,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3277,THE THREE SPINNERS,"The mother rejoiced greatly in her heart, and the Queen took the"
3278,THE THREE SPINNERS,"maiden home with her. When they arrived in the castle, she led her up"
3279,THE THREE SPINNERS,"into three rooms, which were piled from top to bottom with the finest"
3280,THE THREE SPINNERS,flax.
3281,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3282,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Now spin me this flax,"" said the Queen, ""and when thou has spun it"
3283,THE THREE SPINNERS,"all, thou shalt have my eldest son for a husband. Although thou art"
3284,THE THREE SPINNERS,"poor, yet I do not despise thee on that account, for thy untiring"
3285,THE THREE SPINNERS,"industry is dowry enough."""
3286,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3287,THE THREE SPINNERS,"The maiden was filled with inward terror, for she could not have spun"
3288,THE THREE SPINNERS,the flax had she sat there day and night until she was three hundred
3289,THE THREE SPINNERS,"years old! When she was left alone, she began to weep, and thus she"
3290,THE THREE SPINNERS,sat for three days without stirring a finger.
3291,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3292,THE THREE SPINNERS,"On the third day the Queen came, and when she saw that nothing was"
3293,THE THREE SPINNERS,"as yet spun, she wondered over it, but the maiden excused herself by"
3294,THE THREE SPINNERS,saying that she could not begin in consequence of the great sorrow she
3295,THE THREE SPINNERS,felt in being separated from her mother.
3296,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3297,THE THREE SPINNERS,"This satisfied the Queen, who, on leaving her, said:"
3298,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3299,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Thou must begin to work for me to-morrow."""
3300,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3301,THE THREE SPINNERS,"But when the maiden was once more alone, she did not know what to do,"
3302,THE THREE SPINNERS,"or how to help herself, and in her distress she went to the window and"
3303,THE THREE SPINNERS,"looked out. She saw three women passing by, the first of whom had a"
3304,THE THREE SPINNERS,"great broad foot, the second such a large under-lip that it hung down"
3305,THE THREE SPINNERS,"to her chin, and the third an enormous thumb."
3306,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3307,THE THREE SPINNERS,"They stopped under the window, and, looking up, asked the maiden what"
3308,THE THREE SPINNERS,was the matter.
3309,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3310,THE THREE SPINNERS,"When she had told them of her trouble, they immediately offered her"
3311,THE THREE SPINNERS,"their help, and said:"
3312,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3313,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Wilt thou invite us to the wedding, and not be ashamed of us, but"
3314,THE THREE SPINNERS,"call us thy aunts, and let us sit at thy table? If thou wilt, we will"
3315,THE THREE SPINNERS,"spin all the flax, and do it in a very short time."""
3316,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3317,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""With all my heart,"" answered the girl, ""only come in, and begin at"
3318,THE THREE SPINNERS,"once."""
3319,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3320,THE THREE SPINNERS,"Then she admitted the three strange women, and, making a clear space"
3321,THE THREE SPINNERS,"in the first room, they sat themselves down and began spinning."
3322,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3323,THE THREE SPINNERS,"One drew the thread and trod the wheel, the other moistened the"
3324,THE THREE SPINNERS,"thread, the third pressed it and beat it on the table, and every time"
3325,THE THREE SPINNERS,"she did so, a pile of thread fell on the ground spun in the finest"
3326,THE THREE SPINNERS,way.
3327,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3328,THE THREE SPINNERS,"The maiden concealed the three spinners from the Queen, but showed"
3329,THE THREE SPINNERS,"her the heaps of spun yarn whenever she came, and received no end of"
3330,THE THREE SPINNERS,praise for it.
3331,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3332,THE THREE SPINNERS,"When the first room was empty, the second was commenced, and when that"
3333,THE THREE SPINNERS,"was finished, the third was begun, and very soon cleared."
3334,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3335,THE THREE SPINNERS,"Then the three spinners took their leave, saying to the maiden:"
3336,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3337,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Forget not what thou hast promised us; it will make thy fortune."""
3338,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3339,THE THREE SPINNERS,When the girl showed the Queen the empty rooms and the great piles of
3340,THE THREE SPINNERS,"thread, the wedding was announced. The bridegroom rejoiced that he had"
3341,THE THREE SPINNERS,"won so clever and industrious a wife, and he praised her exceedingly."
3342,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3343,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""I have three aunts,"" said the maiden, ""and as they have done me many"
3344,THE THREE SPINNERS,"kindnesses, I could not forget them in my good fortune; permit me to"
3345,THE THREE SPINNERS,"invite them to our wedding and allow them to sit with me at table."""
3346,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3347,THE THREE SPINNERS,So the Queen and the bridegroom consented.
3348,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3349,THE THREE SPINNERS,"When the feast commenced, the three old women entered, clothed in the"
3350,THE THREE SPINNERS,"greatest splendor, and the bride said--"
3351,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3352,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Welcome, my dear aunts!"""
3353,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3354,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Alas!"" exclaimed the bridegroom, ""how is it you have such ugly"
3355,THE THREE SPINNERS,"relations?"" and going up to the one with a broad foot, he asked:"
3356,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3357,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Why have you such a broad foot?"""
3358,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3359,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""From threading, from threading,"" she answered."
3360,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3361,THE THREE SPINNERS,"Then he went to the second, and asked:"
3362,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3363,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Why have you such an overhanging lip?"""
3364,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3365,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""From moistening the thread,"" she replied, ""from moistening the"
3366,THE THREE SPINNERS,"thread."""
3367,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3368,THE THREE SPINNERS,Then he asked the third:
3369,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3370,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Why have you such a big thumb?"""
3371,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3372,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""From pressing the thread,"" answered she."
3373,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3374,THE THREE SPINNERS,"Then the Prince became frightened, and said:"
3375,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3376,THE THREE SPINNERS,"""Then shall my lovely bride never more turn a spinning-wheel, as long"
3377,THE THREE SPINNERS,"as she lives!"""
3378,THE THREE SPINNERS,
3379,THE THREE SPINNERS,Thus was the maiden freed from the hated flax-spinning.

3389,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"A cat having made the acquaintance of a mouse, told her so much of the"
3390,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"great love and affection that he had for her, that the mouse at"
3391,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"last consented to live in the same house with him, and to have their"
3392,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"domestic affairs in common. ""But we must provide for the winter,"""
3393,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"said the cat, ""or we shall be starved; you, little mouse, cannot go"
3394,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"everywhere looking for food, or you will meet with an accident."""
3395,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3396,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"This advice was followed, and a pot was brought with some grease in"
3397,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"it. However, when they had got it, they could not imagine where it"
3398,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"should be put; but at last, after a long consideration, the cat said:"
3399,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""I know no better place to put it than in the church, for there no"
3400,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"one dares to steal anything; we will set it beneath the organ, and not"
3401,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"touch it till we really want it."""
3402,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3403,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,So the pot was put away in safety; but not long afterward the cat
3404,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"began to wish for it again, so he spoke to the mouse and said: ""I have"
3405,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,to tell you that I am asked by my aunt to stand godfather to a little
3406,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"son, white with brown marks, whom she has just brought into the world,"
3407,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"and so I must go to the christening. Let me go out to-day, and do you"
3408,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"stop at home and keep house."""
3409,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3410,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Certainly,"" answered the mouse; ""pray, go; and if you eat anything"
3411,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"nice, think of me; I would also willingly drink a little of the sweet"
3412,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"red christening-wine."""
3413,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3414,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"But, alas! it was all a story; for the cat had no aunt, and had not"
3415,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,been asked to stand godfather to any one. He went straight to the
3416,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"church, crept up to the grease-pot, and licked it till he had eaten"
3417,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,off the top; then he took a walk on the roofs of the houses in the
3418,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"town, thinking over his situation, and now and then stretching himself"
3419,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,in the sun and stroking his whiskers as often as he thought of his
3420,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"meal. When it was evening he went home again, and the mouse said: ""So"
3421,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"you have come at last; what a charming day you must have had!"""
3422,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3423,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Yes,"" answered the cat; ""it went off very well!"""
3424,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3425,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""What have you named the kitten?"" asked the mouse."
3426,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3427,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""_Top-off_,"" said the cat very quickly."
3428,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3429,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""_Top-off!_"" replied the mouse; ""that is a curious and remarkable"

3431,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3432,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""What does that matter?"" said the cat; ""it is not worse than"

3434,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3435,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"Not long afterward the cat felt the same longing as before, and said"

3437,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"more by yourself; I am again asked to stand godfather, and, since"
3438,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"the youngster has a white ring round his neck, I cannot get off the"
3439,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"invitation."" So the good little mouse consented, and the cat crept"
3440,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"away behind the wall to the church again, and ate half the contents"
3441,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"of the grease-pot. ""Nothing tastes better than what one eats by one's"

3443,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,home the mouse asked how this child was named.
3444,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3445,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""_Half-out_,"" answered the cat."

3451,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,Pussy's mouth soon began to water again at the recollection of the
3452,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"feasting. ""All good things come in threes,"" said he to the mouse. ""I"
3453,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"am again required to be godfather; this child is quite black, and has"
3454,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"little white claws, but not a single white hair on his body; such a"
3455,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"thing only happens once in two years, so pray excuse me this time."""
3456,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3457,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""_Top-off! Half-out!_"" answered the mouse; ""those are such curious"

3459,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3460,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Ah!"" replied the cat, ""there you sit in your gray coat and long tail,"
3461,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"thinking nonsense. That comes of never going out."""
3462,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3463,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,The mouse busied herself during the cat's absence in putting the house
3464,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"in order, but meanwhile greedy puss licked the grease-pot clean out."
3465,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""When it is all done one will rest in peace,"" thought he to himself,"
3466,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"and as soon as night came he went home fat and tired. The mouse,"
3467,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"however, again asked what name the third child had received. ""It"
3468,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"will not please you any better,"" answered the cat, ""for he is called"
3469,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"_All-out_."""
3470,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3471,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""_All-out!_"" exclaimed the mouse; ""well, that is certainly the most"
3472,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,curious name by far. I have never yet seen it in print. _All-out!_
3473,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"What can that mean?"" and, shaking her head, she rolled herself up and"
3474,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,went to sleep.
3475,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3476,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,After that nobody else asked the cat to stand godfather; but the
3477,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"winter had arrived, and nothing more was to be picked up out of doors;"
3478,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"so the mouse bethought herself of their store of provision, and said,"
3479,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Come, friend cat, we will go to our grease-pot which we laid by; it"
3480,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"will taste well now."""
3481,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3482,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Yes, indeed,"" replied the cat; ""it will taste as well as if you"

3484,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3485,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"So they set out on their journey, and when they arrived at the church"
3486,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"the pot stood in its old place--but it was empty! ""Ah,"" said the"
3487,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"mouse, ""I see what has happened; now I know you are indeed a faithful"
3488,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,friend. You have eaten the whole as you stood godfather; first

3490,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,
3491,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"""Will you be quiet?"" cried the cat. ""Not a word, or I'll eat you."" But"
3492,THE CAT AND THE MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP,"the poor mouse had ""_All-out""_ at her tongue's end, and had scarcely"

3509,THE SWEET SOUP,"met an old woman, who already knew her distress, and who presented her"
3510,THE SWEET SOUP,"with a pot which had the following power. If one said to it, ""Boil,"
3511,THE SWEET SOUP,"little pot!"" it would cook sweet soup; and when one said: ""Stop,"
3512,THE SWEET SOUP,"little pot!"" it would immediately cease to boil. The little girl took"
3513,THE SWEET SOUP,"the pot home to her mother, and now their poverty and distresses were"

3519,THE SWEET SOUP,"she found she did not know the word. Away, therefore, the pot boiled,"
3520,THE SWEET SOUP,and very quickly was over the edge; and as it boiled and boiled the

3546,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,piece of straw. Soon afterwards a live coal flew out of the fire and
3547,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,joined their company. Then the straw began to speak.
3548,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3549,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""Dear friends,"" said he, ""whence come you?"""
3550,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3551,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""I was fortunate enough to spring out of the fire,"" answered the"
3552,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"coal. ""Had I not exerted myself to get out when I did, I should most"
3553,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"certainly have been burnt to ashes."""
3554,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3555,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""I have also just managed to save my skin,"" said the bean. ""Had the"
3556,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"old woman succeeded in putting me into the pot, I should have been"
3557,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"stewed without mercy, just as my comrades are being served now."""
3558,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3559,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""My fate might have been no better,"" the straw told them. ""The old"
3560,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"woman burnt sixty of my brothers at once, but fortunately I was able"
3561,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"to slip through her fingers."""
3562,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3563,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""What shall we do now?"" said the coal."
3564,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3565,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"""Well,"" answered the bean, ""my opinion is that, as we have all been"
3566,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"so fortunate as to escape death, we should leave this place before"
3567,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,any new misfortune overtakes us. Let us all three become traveling
3568,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"companions and set out upon a journey to some unknown country."""
3569,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3570,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"This suggestion pleased both the straw and the coal, so away they all"
3571,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"went at once. Before long they came to a brook, and as there was no"
3572,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,bridge across it they did not know how to get to the other side; but
3573,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"the straw had a good idea: ""I will lay myself over the water, and"
3574,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"you can walk across me as though I were a bridge,"" he said. So he"
3575,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"stretched himself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was"
3576,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"of a hasty disposition, at once tripped gaily on to the newly-built"
3577,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"bridge. Half way across she hesitated, and began to feel afraid of the"
3578,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"rushing water beneath her. She dared go no farther, but neither would"
3579,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"she return; but she stood there so long that the straw caught fire,"
3580,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"broke in two, and fell into the stream. Of course, the coal was bound"
3581,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"to follow. No sooner did she touch the water than--hiss, zish! out she"
3582,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"went, and never glowed again."
3583,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3584,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"The bean, who was a careful fellow, had stayed on the bank, to watch"
3585,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"how the coal got across, before trusting himself to such a slender"
3586,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"bridge. But when he saw what very queer figures his friends cut, he"
3587,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,could not help laughing. He laughed and laughed till he could not
3588,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"stop, and at length he split his side."
3589,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3590,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"It would have gone badly with him then, had not a tailor happened to"
3591,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"pass by. He was a kind-hearted fellow, and at once took out his needle"
3592,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,and thread and began to repair the mischief.
3593,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,
3594,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"The bean thanked him politely, for he knew that the tailor had saved"
3595,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,"his life, but unfortunately he had used black thread, and from that"
3596,THE STRAW THE COAL AND THE BEAN,time till to-day every bean has a little black stitch in its side.

3638,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Once upon a time, when pigs could talk and no one had ever heard of"
3639,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"bacon, there lived an old piggy mother with her three little sons."
3640,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3641,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"They had a very pleasant home in the middle of an oak forest, and were"
3642,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"all just as happy as the day was long, until one sad year the acorn"
3643,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"crop failed; then, indeed, poor Mrs. Piggy-wiggy often had hard work"
3644,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,to make both ends meet.
3645,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3646,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"One day she called her sons to her, and, with tears in her eyes, told"
3647,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,them that she must send them out into the wide world to seek their
3648,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,fortune.
3649,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3650,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"She kissed them all round, and the three little pigs set out upon"
3651,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"their travels, each taking a different road, and carrying a bundle"
3652,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,slung on a stick across his shoulder.
3653,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3654,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The first little pig had not gone far before he met a man carrying a
3655,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"bundle of straw; so he said to him: ""Please, man, give me that straw"
3656,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"to build me a house?"" The man was very good-natured, so he gave him"
3657,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"the bundle of straw, and the little pig built a pretty little house"
3658,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,with it.
3659,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3660,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"No sooner was it finished, and the little pig thinking of going to"
3661,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"bed, than a wolf came along, knocked at the door, and said: ""Little"
3662,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"pig, little pig, let me come in."""
3663,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3664,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the little pig laughed softly, and answered: ""No, no, by the hair"
3665,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"of my chinny-chin-chin."""
3666,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3667,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Then said the wolf sternly: ""I will _make_ you let me in; for I'll"
3668,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"""
3669,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3670,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, because, you"
3671,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"see, it was only of straw and too light; and when he had blown the"
3672,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"house in, he ate up the little pig, and did not leave so much as the"
3673,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,tip of his tail.
3674,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3675,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The second little pig also met a man, and _he_ was carrying a bundle"
3676,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"of furze; so piggy said politely: ""Please, kind man, will you give me"
3677,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"that furze to build me a house?"""
3678,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3679,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The man agreed, and piggy set to work to build himself a snug little"
3680,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,house before the night came on. It was scarcely finished when the wolf
3681,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"came along, and said: ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
3682,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3683,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""No, no, by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin,"" answered the second"
3684,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,little pig.
3685,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3686,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"" said the"
3687,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"wolf. So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at"
3688,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"last he blew the house in, and gobbled the little pig up in a trice."
3689,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3690,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and mortar,"
3691,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"and he said: ""Please, man, will you give me those bricks to build a"
3692,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"house with?"""
3693,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3694,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"So the man gave him the bricks and mortar, and a little trowel as"
3695,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"well, and the little pig built himself a nice strong little house. As"
3696,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"soon as it was finished the wolf came to call, just as he had done to"
3697,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"the other little pigs, and said: ""Little pig, little pig, let me in!"""
3698,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3699,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the little pig answered: ""No, no, by the hair of my"
3700,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"chinny-chin-chin."""
3701,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3702,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Then,"" said the wolf, ""I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your"
3703,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"house in."""
3704,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3705,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he"
3706,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"huffed, and he puffed; but he could _not_ get the house down. At last"
3707,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"he had no breath left to huff and puff with, so he sat down outside"
3708,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,the little pig's house and thought for awhile.
3709,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3710,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Presently he called out: ""Little pig, I know where there is a nice"
3711,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"field of turnips."""
3712,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3713,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Where?"" said the little pig."
3714,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3715,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Behind the farmer's house, three fields away, and if you will be"
3716,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we will go together"
3717,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"and get some breakfast."""
3718,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3719,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Very well,"" said the little pig; ""I will be sure to be ready. What"
3720,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"time do you mean to start?"""
3721,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3722,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""At six o'clock,"" replied the wolf."
3723,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3724,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Well, the wise little pig got up at five, scampered away to the field,"
3725,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,and brought home a fine load of turnips before the wolf came. At six
3726,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"o'clock the wolf came to the little pig's house and said: ""Little pig,"
3727,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"are you ready?"""
3728,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3729,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Ready!"" cried the little pig. ""Why, I have been to the field and"
3730,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"come back long ago, and now I am busy boiling a potful of turnips for"
3731,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"breakfast."""
3732,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3733,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The wolf was very angry indeed; but he made up his mind to catch the
3734,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,little pig somehow or other; so he told him that he knew where there
3735,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,was a nice apple-tree.
3736,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3737,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Where?"" said the little pig."
3738,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3739,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Round the hill in the squire's orchard,"" the wolf said. ""So if"
3740,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"you will promise to play me no tricks, I will come for you tomorrow"
3741,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"morning at five o'clock, and we will go there together and get some"
3742,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"rosy-cheeked apples."""
3743,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3744,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The next morning piggy got up at four o'clock and was off and away
3745,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,long before the wolf came.
3746,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3747,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the orchard was a long way off, and besides, he had the tree to"
3748,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"climb, which is a difficult matter for a little pig, so that before"
3749,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,the sack he had brought with him was quite filled he saw the wolf
3750,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,coming towards him.
3751,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3752,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was dreadfully frightened, but he thought it better to put a good"
3753,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"face on the matter, so when the wolf said: ""Little pig, why are you"
3754,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"here before me? Are they nice apples?"" he replied at once: ""Yes, very;"
3755,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"I will throw down one for you to taste."" So he picked an apple and"
3756,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,threw it so far that whilst the wolf was running to fetch it he had
3757,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,time to jump down and scamper away home.
3758,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3759,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The next day the wolf came again, and told the little pig that there"
3760,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"was going to be a fair in the town that afternoon, and asked him if he"
3761,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,would go with him.
3762,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3763,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Oh! yes,"" said the pig, ""I will go with pleasure. What time will you"
3764,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"be ready to start?"""
3765,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3766,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""At half-past three,"" said the wolf."
3767,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3768,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Of course, the little pig started long before the time, went to the"
3769,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"fair, and bought a fine large butter-churn, and was trotting away with"
3770,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,it on his back when he saw the wolf coming.
3771,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3772,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He did not know what to do, so he crept into the churn to hide, and by"
3773,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,so doing started it rolling.
3774,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3775,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Down the hill it went, rolling over and over, with the little pig"
3776,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,squeaking inside.
3777,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3778,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The wolf could not think what the strange thing rolling down the hill
3779,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,could be; so he turned tail and ran away home in a fright without ever
3780,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,going to the fair at all. He went to the little pig's house to tell
3781,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,him how frightened he had been by a large round thing which came
3782,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,rolling past him down the hill.
3783,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3784,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Ha! ha!"" laughed the little pig; ""so I frightened you, eh? I had been"
3785,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,to the fair and bought a butter-churn; when I saw you I got inside it
3786,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"and rolled down the hill."""
3787,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3788,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,This made the wolf so angry that he declared that he _would_ eat up
3789,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"the little pig, and that nothing should save him, for he would jump"
3790,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,down the chimney.
3791,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3792,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But the clever little pig hung a pot full of water over the hearth
3793,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"and then made a blazing fire, and just as the wolf was coming down the"
3794,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,chimney he took off the cover and in fell the wolf. In a second the
3795,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,little pig had popped the lid on again.
3796,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3797,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Then he boiled the wolf, and ate him for supper, and after that he"
3798,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"lived quietly and comfortably all his days, and was never troubled by"
3799,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,a wolf again.

4768,THE LITTLE LAND,
4769,THE LITTLE LAND,When at home alone I sit
4770,THE LITTLE LAND,"And am very tired of it,"
4771,THE LITTLE LAND,I have just to shut my eyes
4772,THE LITTLE LAND,To go sailing through the skies--
4773,THE LITTLE LAND,
4774,THE LITTLE LAND,To go sailing far away
4775,THE LITTLE LAND,To the pleasant Land of Play;
4776,THE LITTLE LAND,To the fairy land afar
4777,THE LITTLE LAND,Where the Little People are;
4778,THE LITTLE LAND,"Where the clover-tops are trees,"
4779,THE LITTLE LAND,"And the rain-pools are the seas,"
4780,THE LITTLE LAND,And the leaves like little ships
4781,THE LITTLE LAND,Sail about on tiny trips;
4782,THE LITTLE LAND,And above the daisy tree
4783,THE LITTLE LAND,"Through the grasses,"
4784,THE LITTLE LAND,High o'erhead the Bumble Bee
4785,THE LITTLE LAND,Hums and passes.
4786,THE LITTLE LAND,In that forest to and fro
4787,THE LITTLE LAND,"I can wander, I can go;"
4788,THE LITTLE LAND,"See the spider and the fly,"
4789,THE LITTLE LAND,And the ants go marching by
4790,THE LITTLE LAND,Carrying parcels with their feet
4791,THE LITTLE LAND,Down the green and grassy street
4792,THE LITTLE LAND,I can in the sorrel sit
4793,THE LITTLE LAND,Where the ladybird alit.
4794,THE LITTLE LAND,I can climb the jointed grass;
4795,THE LITTLE LAND,And on high
4796,THE LITTLE LAND,See the greater swallows pass
4797,THE LITTLE LAND,"In the sky,"
4798,THE LITTLE LAND,And the round sun rolling by
4799,THE LITTLE LAND,Heeding no such thing as I.
4800,THE LITTLE LAND,
4801,THE LITTLE LAND,Through the forest I can pass
4802,THE LITTLE LAND,"Till, as in a looking-glass,"
4803,THE LITTLE LAND,Humming fly and daisy tree
4804,THE LITTLE LAND,"And my tiny self I see,"
4805,THE LITTLE LAND,Painted very clear and neat
4806,THE LITTLE LAND,On the rain-pool at my feet.
4807,THE LITTLE LAND,Should a leaflet come to land
4808,THE LITTLE LAND,"Drifting near to where I stand,"
4809,THE LITTLE LAND,Straight I'll board that tiny boat
4810,THE LITTLE LAND,Round the rain-pool sea to float.
4811,THE LITTLE LAND,
4812,THE LITTLE LAND,Little thoughtful creatures sit
4813,THE LITTLE LAND,On the grassy coasts of it;
4814,THE LITTLE LAND,Little things with lovely eyes
4815,THE LITTLE LAND,See me sailing with surprise.
4816,THE LITTLE LAND,Some are clad in armor green--
4817,THE LITTLE LAND,(These have sure to battle been!)
4818,THE LITTLE LAND,"Some are pied with ev'ry hue,"
4819,THE LITTLE LAND,"Black and crimson, gold and blue;"
4820,THE LITTLE LAND,Some have wings and swift are gone;--
4821,THE LITTLE LAND,But they all look kindly on.
4822,THE LITTLE LAND,
4823,THE LITTLE LAND,When my eyes I once again
4824,THE LITTLE LAND,Open and see all things plain;
4825,THE LITTLE LAND,"High bare walls, great bare floor;"
4826,THE LITTLE LAND,Great big knobs on drawer and door;
4827,THE LITTLE LAND,"Great big people perched on chairs,"
4828,THE LITTLE LAND,"Stitching tucks and mending tears,"
4829,THE LITTLE LAND,"Each a hill that I could climb,"
4830,THE LITTLE LAND,And talking nonsense all the time--
4831,THE LITTLE LAND,"O dear me,"
4832,THE LITTLE LAND,That I could be
4833,THE LITTLE LAND,"A sailor on the rain-pool sea,"
4834,THE LITTLE LAND,"A climber in the clover-tree,"
4835,THE LITTLE LAND,"And just come back, a sleepy-head,"
4836,THE LITTLE LAND,Late at night to go to bed.

5175,GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD MORNING,The tall pink foxglove bowed his head;

5227,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"The way into my parlor is up a winding stair,"
5228,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And I have many curious things to show when you are there."""
5229,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Oh no, no,"" said the little fly; ""to ask me is in vain,"

5232,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high."

5238,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
5239,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Said the cunning spider to the fly: ""Dear friend, what can I do"

5241,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,I have within my pantry good store of all that's nice;
5242,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"I'm sure you're very welcome--will you please to take a slice?"""
5243,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Oh no, no,"" said the little fly; ""kind sir, that cannot be:"

5246,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Sweet creature!"" said the spider, ""you're witty and you're wise;"

5248,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,I have a little looking-glass upon my parlor shelf;
5249,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"If you'll step in one moment, dear, you shall behold yourself."""
5250,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""I thank you, gentle sir,"" she said, ""for what you're pleased to say,"
5251,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And, bidding you good morning now, I'll call another day."""
5252,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
5253,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,"
5254,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again:
5255,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly,"
5256,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And set his table ready to dine upon the fly;
5257,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Then came out to his door again, and merrily did sing:"
5258,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with pearl and silver wing;"
5259,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Your robes are green and purple; there's a crest upon your head;
5260,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!"""
5261,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
5262,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Alas, alas! how very soon this silly little fly,"
5263,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by;"
5264,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,"
5265,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Thinking only of her brilliant eyes and green and purple hue,"
5266,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Thinking only of her crested head. Poor, foolish thing! at last"
5267,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast;"
5268,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"He dragged her up his winding stair, into the dismal den--"
5269,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Within his little parlor--but she ne'er came out again!
5270,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
5271,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And now, dear little children, who may this story read,"
5272,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"To idle, silly, flattering words I pray you ne'er give heed;"
5273,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Unto an evil counselor close heart and ear and eye,"

5374,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5375,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5376,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Many years ago, a woodcutter and his wife, with their two children,"
5377,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hansel and Gretel, lived upon the outskirts of a dense wood. They were"
5378,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"very poor, so that when a famine fell upon the land, and bread became"
5379,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"dear, they could no longer afford to buy sufficient food for the whole"
5380,HANSEL AND GRETEL,family.
5381,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5382,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"One night, as the poor man lay tossing on his hard bed, he cried aloud"
5383,HANSEL AND GRETEL,in his grief and anguish:
5384,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5385,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Alas! what will become of us? How can I feed my hungry little ones"
5386,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"when we have no food for ourselves?"""
5387,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5388,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Listen to me, good-man,"" answered his wife, who was stepmother to the"
5389,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"children. ""As it is no longer possible for us to keep our children, we"
5390,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"will take them into the wood with us tomorrow, light a fire for them,"
5391,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and give each a piece of bread and leave them. They will not easily
5392,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"find their way back, and so we shall be rid of the burden of them."""
5393,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5394,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"But the father said: ""No, no! I could not find it in my heart to"
5395,HANSEL AND GRETEL,leave my darlings to perish. The wild beasts would tear them limb from
5396,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"limb."""
5397,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5398,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Then,"" answered the wife, ""we must all four die of hunger."" She gave"
5399,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"her husband no peace until he promised to do as she wished, and at"
5400,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"last, very unwillingly, he consented."
5401,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5402,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Now, the two children had been too hungry to go to sleep that night,"
5403,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and so it happened that they overheard all that their parents were
5404,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"saying. Gretel wept bitterly, but brave little Hansel did his best to"
5405,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"comfort her. ""Don't be afraid,"" he said; ""I will take care of you."""
5406,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5407,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"As soon as his father and stepmother were asleep, he slipped on his"
5408,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"coat, and-opening the door softly, went out into the garden. The moon"
5409,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"was shining brightly, and by its light he could see the little white"
5410,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"pebbles that lay scattered in front of the house, shining like little"
5411,HANSEL AND GRETEL,pieces of silver. He stooped and filled his pockets as full as he
5412,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"could, and then went back to Gretel, and once more bidding her be"
5413,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"comforted, for God would be sure to watch over them, he jumped into"
5414,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"bed, and they both fell fast asleep."
5415,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5416,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Early in the morning, before the sun had risen, the stepmother came"
5417,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and wakened the children. ""Rise, little lie-a-beds,"" she said, ""and"
5418,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"come with us into the wood to gather fuel."""
5419,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5420,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"She gave them each a piece of bread for their dinner, and told them to"
5421,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"be sure not to eat it too soon, for they would get nothing more."
5422,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5423,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Gretel carried the bread in her pinafore, because Hansel had his"
5424,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"pockets full, and then they all set out upon their way to the wood."
5425,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5426,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"As they trudged along, the father noticed that his little son kept"
5427,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"turning back to look at the house. ""Take care, my boy,"" he said, ""or"
5428,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"you will slip. What are you looking at so earnestly?"""
5429,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5430,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""I am watching my kitten, father: she is sitting on the roof to bid me"
5431,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"good-by."""
5432,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5433,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Silly little lad, that is not your cat,"" said the stepmother; ""it is"
5434,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"only the morning sun shining on the chimney."""
5435,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5436,HANSEL AND GRETEL,But Hansel had not been watching his cat at all; he had stayed behind
5437,HANSEL AND GRETEL,to drop the pebbles upon the path.
5438,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5439,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"When they reached the thickest part of the forest, the father bade the"
5440,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"children gather wood, that he might kindle a fire for them, so that"
5441,HANSEL AND GRETEL,they might rest beside it and warm themselves whilst he and his wife
5442,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"were cutting the fuel. So they gathered a pile of brushwood and twigs,"
5443,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and as soon as it was well alight, the parents left them, promising to"
5444,HANSEL AND GRETEL,return as soon as they had finished their work.
5445,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5446,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hansel and Gretel sat down by the fire, and when midday came they ate"
5447,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"their bread and sat listening to the strokes of their father's axe,"
5448,HANSEL AND GRETEL,thinking all the time that he was near to them. But what they heard
5449,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"was only a dry branch which the man had bound to a tree, so that the"
5450,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"wind swung it hither and thither, and the noise it made deceived the"
5451,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"children. At last the poor, tired, little eyelids closed, and, side by"
5452,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"side, brother and sister fell asleep."
5453,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5454,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"When they awoke, the night was very dark, and Gretel was frightened,"
5455,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and began to cry. Hansel put his arms around her and whispered. ""Wait,"
5456,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"dearie, till the moon rises; we shall soon find our way home then."""
5457,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5458,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"As soon as the bright moon rose, Hansel took his little sister by the"
5459,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"hand, and all night long they followed the track of the little white"
5460,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"pebbles, until at daybreak they came to their father's house."
5461,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5462,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"They knocked at the door, and no sooner did the stepmother open it"
5463,HANSEL AND GRETEL,than she began to scold them for having stayed out so long in the
5464,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"wood; but the father greeted them kindly, for he had grieved sorely"
5465,HANSEL AND GRETEL,for his little ones.
5466,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5467,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"In a short time they were as badly off as ever, and one night they"
5468,HANSEL AND GRETEL,again heard their mother trying to persuade her husband to take them
5469,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"out into the wood and lose them. ""There is nothing left in the house"
5470,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"but half a loaf of bread,"" she said; ""for our own sakes it is better"
5471,HANSEL AND GRETEL,to get rid of the children; but this time we will lead them farther
5472,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"away, so that they will not be able to find their way home."""
5473,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5474,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"But the man would not agree. ""Better to divide our last morsel with"
5475,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"them,"" he said, ""and then die together."""
5476,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5477,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"His wife would not listen to what he said, but scolded him for his"
5478,HANSEL AND GRETEL,want of thought for her; and at last the poor man gave way a second
5479,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"time, just as he had done at first."
5480,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5481,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"But the children had overheard all that was said, and as soon as the"
5482,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"mother and father were asleep, Hansel stole down to the door, meaning"
5483,HANSEL AND GRETEL,to go and collect pebbles as he had done before; but the door was
5484,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"locked and bolted, and he could not get out. ""Never mind, Gretel,"" he"
5485,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"said consolingly, ""the good God will surely help us."""
5486,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5487,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Early in the morning the woman wakened the children, and, giving them"
5488,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"a small piece of bread, bade them follow her and their father into the"
5489,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"wood. As they went, Hansel crumbled his morsel of bread in his pocket"
5490,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and strewed the crumbs upon the path.
5491,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5492,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Come, Hansel,"" said the father, ""don't loiter so, sonny. What can you"
5493,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"see to stare at so often?"""
5494,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5495,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""My little dove, father. It is sitting on the housetop, bidding me"
5496,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"good-by."""
5497,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5498,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Nonsense,"" said the woman, ""it is not your dove; it is only the"
5499,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"rising sun shining upon the chimney."""
5500,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5501,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hansel did not answer, but he went on strewing his crumbs carefully"
5502,HANSEL AND GRETEL,until the last morsel of bread was gone.
5503,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5504,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Deeper and deeper into the wood they went, where the children had"
5505,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"never been before. There a great fire was kindled, and the mother"
5506,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"said: ""Stay here, children, whilst your father and I go to cut wood."
5507,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"If you are tired you may sleep a while, and we will fetch you when it"
5508,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"is time to go home."""
5509,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5510,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"When dinner-time came, Gretel divided her piece of bread with Hansel,"
5511,HANSEL AND GRETEL,because he had scattered all his share upon the road; and then they
5512,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"went to sleep. The evening shadows fell, but still no one came to"
5513,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"fetch the poor children, and it was not until midnight that they"
5514,HANSEL AND GRETEL,awakened.
5515,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5516,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hansel put his arms round his sister and told her not to fear, for"
5517,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"when the moon rose they would easily be able to see the crumbs, and so"
5518,HANSEL AND GRETEL,find their way home again.
5519,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5520,HANSEL AND GRETEL,So when the moon rose they set out upon their way; but alas! there
5521,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"were no crumbs to be seen, for the little birds that lived in the"
5522,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"green wood were as hungry as the children, and had eaten them all up."
5523,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5524,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""We will find the way somehow,"" cried cheerful little Hansel; but"
5525,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"though they traveled all night long, and the next day too, they could"
5526,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"not find it. Poor little mites, how tired and hungry they were, for"
5527,HANSEL AND GRETEL,they had nothing to eat but the berries that grew by the roadside!
5528,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5529,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"When at length the weary little feet could go no farther, the children"
5530,HANSEL AND GRETEL,lay down beneath a tree and slept.
5531,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5532,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"On the third day they were still as far away as ever, and it seemed"
5533,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"to them that the longer they walked the deeper they got into the wood,"
5534,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and they began to be afraid that they would die of cold and hunger.
5535,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5536,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"But presently, when the midday sun was shining brightly, they noticed"
5537,HANSEL AND GRETEL,a little snow-white bird singing so sweetly that they could not help
5538,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"but stay to listen. When the birdie's song was ended, he spread his"
5539,HANSEL AND GRETEL,wings and flew away.
5540,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5541,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"The children followed him until they reached a little house, on the"
5542,HANSEL AND GRETEL,roof of which he perched. Then the children saw with surprise that the
5543,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"strange little house was built entirely of bread, roofed with cakes,"
5544,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and with windows of barley sugar.
5545,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5546,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""See, Gretel,"" cried Hansel joyfully, ""there is food for us in"
5547,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"plenty. I will take a piece of the roof, and you shall have one of the"
5548,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"windows."""
5549,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5550,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"He stretched out his hand to help himself, and Gretel had already"
5551,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"begun to nibble one of the window-panes, when suddenly they heard a"
5552,HANSEL AND GRETEL,voice call from within:--
5553,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5554,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Nibbly, nibbly, mouse!"
5555,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Who's nibbling at my house?"""
5556,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5557,HANSEL AND GRETEL,The children answered quickly:--
5558,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5559,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""'Tis my Lady Wind that blows,"
5560,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"As round about the house she goes."""
5561,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5562,HANSEL AND GRETEL,And then they went on eating as though nothing had happened for the
5563,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"cake of which the roof was made just suited Hansel's taste, whilst the"
5564,HANSEL AND GRETEL,barley-sugar window-panes were better than any sweetmeat Gretel had
5565,HANSEL AND GRETEL,ever tasted before.
5566,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5567,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"All at once the door of the cottage flew wide open, and out came an"
5568,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"old, old woman, leaning upon a crutch. The children were so frightened"
5569,HANSEL AND GRETEL,that they dropped their food and clung to each other.
5570,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5571,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"The old woman nodded her head to them, and said: ""Who brought you"
5572,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"here, my pets? Come inside, come inside; no one will hurt you."""
5573,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5574,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"She took their hands and led them into the house, and set before them"
5575,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"all kinds of delicious foods, milk, sugared pancakes, apples, and"
5576,HANSEL AND GRETEL,nuts. When they had finished their meal she showed them two cosy
5577,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"little white beds, and as Hansel and Gretel lay snugly tucked up in"
5578,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"them, they thought to themselves that surely they had now found the"
5579,HANSEL AND GRETEL,most delightful place in the whole wide world.
5580,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5581,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"But the old woman had only pretended to be friendly and kind, for she"
5582,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"was really a wicked old witch, who was always lying in wait to catch"
5583,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"little children, indeed, she had built the little house of bread and"
5584,HANSEL AND GRETEL,cakes especially to entice them in. Whenever anyone came into her
5585,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"power, she cooked and ate him, and thought what a fine feast she had"
5586,HANSEL AND GRETEL,had.
5587,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5588,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Witches have red eyes and cannot see far, but they have keen scent,"
5589,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"like animals, and can tell at once when a human being is near to them."
5590,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5591,HANSEL AND GRETEL,As soon as Hansel and Gretel came into her neighborhood she laughed to
5592,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"herself and said mockingly: ""Ha, ha! they are mine already; they will"
5593,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"not easily escape me."""
5594,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5595,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she stood beside"
5596,HANSEL AND GRETEL,them and admired their rosy cheeks and soft round limbs.
5597,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5598,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""What nice tit-bits for me,"" murmured she. Then, seizing Hansel by the"
5599,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"hand, she led him to a little stable, and, in spite of his cries and"
5600,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"screams, shut him up and left him. Then she shook Gretel until she"
5601,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"was awake, and bade her get up at once and carry food and drink to her"
5602,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"brother, and it must be of the best too, for she wished to fatten him."
5603,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5604,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""When he is nice and plump, I shall eat him,"" said the cruel old"
5605,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"witch. Gretel wept bitterly, but it was quite in vain, for she was"
5606,HANSEL AND GRETEL,obliged to do the witch's bidding; and every day she cooked the
5607,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"choicest food for her brother, while she herself lived upon nothing"
5608,HANSEL AND GRETEL,but oyster-shells.
5609,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5610,HANSEL AND GRETEL,Day by day the old woman visited the stable and called to Hansel to
5611,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"put his finger through the window bars, that she might see if he were"
5612,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"getting fat; but the little fellow held out a bone instead, and as her"
5613,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"eyes were dim with age, she mistook the bone for the boy's finger,"
5614,HANSEL AND GRETEL,and thought how thin and lean he was. When a whole month had passed
5615,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"without Hansel becoming the least bit fatter, the old witch lost"
5616,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"patience and declared she would wait no longer. ""Hurry, Gretel,"" she"
5617,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"said to the little girl, ""fill the pot with water, for to-morrow, be"
5618,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"he lean or fat, Hansel shall be cooked for my dinner."""
5619,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5620,HANSEL AND GRETEL,The tears chased each other down Gretel's cheeks as she carried in the
5621,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"water, and she sobbed aloud in her grief. ""Dear God,"" she cried, ""we"
5622,HANSEL AND GRETEL,have no one to help us but Thou. Alas! if only the wild beasts in the
5623,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"wood had devoured us, at least we should have died together."""
5624,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5625,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Cease your chattering,"" cried the old witch angrily. ""It will not"
5626,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"help you, so you may as well be still."""
5627,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5628,HANSEL AND GRETEL,The next morning poor Gretel was forced to light the fire and hang the
5629,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"great pot of water over it, and then the witch said: ""First we will"
5630,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"bake. I have kneaded the dough, and heated the oven; you shall creep"
5631,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"inside it to see if it is hot enough to bake the bread."""
5632,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5633,HANSEL AND GRETEL,But Gretel guessed that the old witch meant to shut the door upon her
5634,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and roast her, so she pretended that she did not know how to get in."
5635,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5636,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Silly goose,"" said the witch. ""The door is wide enough, to be sure."
5637,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Why, even I could get inside it."" As she spoke, she popped her head"
5638,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"into the oven. In a moment Gretel sprang towards her, pushed her"
5639,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"inside, shut the iron door, and shot the bolt. Oh! how she squealed"
5640,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and shrieked, but Gretel ran off as fast as she could, and so there"
5641,HANSEL AND GRETEL,was an end of the cruel old witch.
5642,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5643,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Quick as thought, Gretel ran to her brother. ""We are saved, Hansel,"""
5644,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"she cried, opening the door of the stable, ""the wicked old witch is"
5645,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"dead."""
5646,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5647,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Hansel flew from his prison as a bird from its cage, and the two happy"
5648,HANSEL AND GRETEL,little children kissed each other and jumped for joy. No longer afraid
5649,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"of the old witch, they entered the house, hand in hand, and then"
5650,HANSEL AND GRETEL,they saw that in every corner of the room were boxes of pearls and
5651,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"diamonds, and all kinds of precious gems."
5652,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5653,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Ah!"" said Hansel merrily, ""these are better than pebbles, Gretel,"""
5654,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"and he stuffed his pockets with the jewels, whilst Gretel filled her"
5655,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"pinafore. ""Now,"" said Hansel, ""we will leave the witch's wood behind"
5656,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"us as fast as we can."""
5657,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5658,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"So off they ran, and never stopped until they came to a lake, upon"
5659,HANSEL AND GRETEL,which swam a large white duck.
5660,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5661,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""How can we cross,"" said Hansel, ""for there is no bridge anywhere?"""
5662,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5663,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""And no ship either,"" Gretel answered; ""but we will ask the pretty"
5664,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"white duck to carry us over."" So they cried aloud:--"
5665,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5666,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"""Little duck, little duck,"
5667,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"With wings so white,"
5668,HANSEL AND GRETEL,Carry us over
5669,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"The waters bright."""
5670,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5671,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"The duck came at once, and, taking Hansel upon her back, carried him"
5672,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"over to the other side, and then did the same for Gretel. They went"
5673,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"merrily on their way, and very soon they found themselves in a part of"
5674,HANSEL AND GRETEL,the wood they knew quite well.
5675,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5676,HANSEL AND GRETEL,When they saw the roof of their father's house in the distance they
5677,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"began to run, and, breathless with haste, half laughing and half"
5678,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"crying, they rushed into the cottage and flung themselves into their"
5679,HANSEL AND GRETEL,father's arms.
5680,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5681,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"Oh! how pleased he was to see them once again, for he had not known a"
5682,HANSEL AND GRETEL,happy hour since he had left them alone in the wood. Gretel shook out
5683,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"her pinafore, and Hansel emptied his pockets, and the floor of the"
5684,HANSEL AND GRETEL,little room was quite covered with glittering precious stones.
5685,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5686,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"So now their troubles were at an end, for the cruel stepmother was"
5687,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"dead, and Hansel and Gretel and their father lived together happily"
5688,HANSEL AND GRETEL,ever after.
5689,HANSEL AND GRETEL,
5690,HANSEL AND GRETEL,"My story is ended, and see, there runs a little mouse, and the first"
5691,HANSEL AND GRETEL,who catches him shall have a fur cap made from his skin.

5792,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"first one of the lambs, brought it to the wolf, and then ran away. The"
5793,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"wolf devoured it quickly, but was not contented, and went to fetch the"
5794,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"other lamb by himself, but he did it so awkwardly that he aroused the"
5795,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"attention of the mother, who began to cry and bleat loudly, so that"
5796,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"the peasants ran up. There they found the wolf, and beat him so"
5797,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"unmercifully that he ran, howling and limping, to the fox, and said:"
5798,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"""You have led me to a nice place, for, when I went to fetch the other"
5799,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"lamb, the peasants came and beat me terribly!"""
5800,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5801,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"""Why are you such a glutton, then?"" asked the fox."
5802,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5803,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"The next day they went again into the fields, and the covetous wolf"
5804,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"said to the fox: ""Get me something to eat now, or I will devour you!"""
5805,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5806,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,The fox said he knew a country house where the cook was going that
5807,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"evening to make some pancakes, and thither they went. When they"
5808,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"arrived, the fox sneaked and crept around round the house, until he at"
5809,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"last discovered where the dish was standing, out of which he stole six"
5810,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"pancakes, and took them to the wolf, saying, ""There is something for"
5811,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"you to eat!"" and then ran away. The wolf dispatched these in a minute"
5812,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"or two, and, wishing to taste some more, he went and seized the dish,"
5813,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,but took it away so hurriedly that it broke in pieces. The noise of
5814,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"its fall brought out the woman, who, as soon as she saw the wolf,"
5815,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"called her people, who, hastening up, beat him with such a good will"
5816,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"that he ran home to the fox, howling, with two lame legs! ""What a"
5817,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"horrid place you have drawn me into now,"" cried he; ""the peasants have"
5818,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"caught me, and dressed my skin finely!"""
5819,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5820,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"""Why, then, are you such a glutton?"" said the fox."
5821,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5822,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"When they went out again the third day, the wolf limping along with"
5823,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"weariness, he said to the fox: ""Get me something to eat now, or I will"
5824,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"devour you!"""
5825,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5826,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"The fox said he knew a man who had just killed a pig, and salted the"
5827,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"meat down in a cask in his cellar, and that they could get at it. The"
5828,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,wolf replied that he would go with him on condition that he helped him
5829,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"if he could not escape. ""Oh, of course I will, on mine own account!"""
5830,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"said the fox, and showed him the tricks and ways by which they could"
5831,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"get into the cellar. When they went in there was meat in abundance,"
5832,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"and the wolf was enraptured at the sight. The fox, too, had a taste,"
5833,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"but kept looking round while eating, and ran frequently to the hole"
5834,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"by which they had entered, to see if his body would slip through it"
5835,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"easily. Presently the wolf asked: ""Why are you running about so,"
5836,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"you fox, jumping in and out?"" ""I want to see if any one is coming,"""
5837,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"replied the fox cunningly; ""but mind you do not eat too much!"""
5838,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,
5839,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,The wolf said he would not leave till the cask was quite empty;
5840,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"and meanwhile the peasant, who had heard the noise made by the fox,"
5841,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"entered the cellar. The fox, as soon as he saw him, made a spring,"
5842,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,and was through the hole in a jiffy; and the wolf tried to follow his
5843,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"example, but he had eaten so much that his body was too big for the"
5844,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"opening, and he stuck fast. Then came the peasant with a cudgel, and"
5845,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,"beat him sorely; but the fox leaped away into the forest, very glad to"
5846,THE WOLF AND THE FOX,get rid of the old glutton.

5964,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Once upon a time there was a miller, who was so poor that at his death"
5965,PUSS IN BOOTS,"he had nothing to leave to his three children but his mill, his ass,"
5966,PUSS IN BOOTS,"and his cat. The eldest son took the mill, and the second the ass, so"
5967,PUSS IN BOOTS,there was nothing left for poor Jack but to take Puss.
5968,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5969,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Jack could not help thinking that he had been treated shabbily. ""My"
5970,PUSS IN BOOTS,"brothers will be able to earn an honest livelihood,"" he sighed, ""but"
5971,PUSS IN BOOTS,"as for me, though Puss may feed himself by catching mice, I shall"
5972,PUSS IN BOOTS,"certainly die of hunger."""
5973,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5974,PUSS IN BOOTS,"The cat, who had overheard his young master, jumped upon his shoulder,"
5975,PUSS IN BOOTS,"and, rubbing himself gently against his cheek, began to speak. ""Dear"
5976,PUSS IN BOOTS,"master,"" said he, ""do not grieve. I am not as useless as you think me,"
5977,PUSS IN BOOTS,"and will undertake to make your fortune for you, if only you will buy"
5978,PUSS IN BOOTS,"me a pair of boots, and give me that old bag."""
5979,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5980,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Now, Jack had very little money to spare, but, knowing Puss to be a"
5981,PUSS IN BOOTS,"faithful old friend, he made up his mind to trust him, and so spent"
5982,PUSS IN BOOTS,all he possessed upon a smart pair of boots made of buff-colored
5983,PUSS IN BOOTS,"leather. They fitted perfectly, so Puss put them on, took the old bag"
5984,PUSS IN BOOTS,"which his master gave him, and trotted off to a neighboring warren in"
5985,PUSS IN BOOTS,which he knew there was a great number of rabbits.
5986,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5987,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Having put some bran and fresh parsley into the bag, he laid it upon"
5988,PUSS IN BOOTS,"the ground, hid himself, and waited. Presently two foolish little"
5989,PUSS IN BOOTS,"rabbits, sniffing the food, ran straight into the bag, when the clever"
5990,PUSS IN BOOTS,cat drew the strings and caught them.
5991,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5992,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Then, slinging the bag over his shoulder, he hastened off to the"
5993,PUSS IN BOOTS,"palace, where he asked to speak to the King. Having been shown into"
5994,PUSS IN BOOTS,"the royal presence, he bowed and said:"
5995,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5996,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Sire, my Lord the Marquis of Carabas has commanded me to present"
5997,PUSS IN BOOTS,"these rabbits to your Majesty, with his respects."""
5998,PUSS IN BOOTS,
5999,PUSS IN BOOTS,"The monarch having desired his thanks to be given to the Marquis (who,"
6000,PUSS IN BOOTS,"as you will guess, was really our poor Jack), then ordered his head"
6001,PUSS IN BOOTS,"cook to dress the rabbits for dinner, and he and his daughter partook"
6002,PUSS IN BOOTS,of them with great enjoyment.
6003,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6004,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Day by day Puss brought home stores of good food, so that he and his"
6005,PUSS IN BOOTS,"master lived in plenty, and besides that, he did not fail to keep the"
6006,PUSS IN BOOTS,King and his courtiers well supplied with game.
6007,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6008,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Sometimes he would lay a brace of partridges at the royal feet,"
6009,PUSS IN BOOTS,"sometimes a fine large hare, but whatever it was, it always came"
6010,PUSS IN BOOTS,"with the same message: ""From my Lord the Marquis of Carabas""; so that"
6011,PUSS IN BOOTS,"everyone at Court was talking of this strange nobleman, whom no one"
6012,PUSS IN BOOTS,"had ever seen, but who sent such generous presents to his Majesty."
6013,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6014,PUSS IN BOOTS,At length Puss decided that it was time for his master to be
6015,PUSS IN BOOTS,introduced at Court. So one day he persuaded him to go and bathe in a
6016,PUSS IN BOOTS,"river near, having heard that the King would soon pass that way."
6017,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6018,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Jack stood shivering up to his neck in water, wondering what was to"
6019,PUSS IN BOOTS,"happen next, when suddenly the King's carriage appeared in sight. At"
6020,PUSS IN BOOTS,once Puss began to call out as loudly as he could:
6021,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6022,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Help, help! My Lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!"""
6023,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6024,PUSS IN BOOTS,"The King put his head out of the carriage window and, recognizing the"
6025,PUSS IN BOOTS,"cat, ordered his attendants to go to the assistance of the Marquis."
6026,PUSS IN BOOTS,"While Jack was being taken out of the water, Puss ran to the King"
6027,PUSS IN BOOTS,and told him that some robbers had run off with his master's clothes
6028,PUSS IN BOOTS,"whilst he was bathing, the truth of the matter being that the cunning"
6029,PUSS IN BOOTS,cat had hidden them under a stone.
6030,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6031,PUSS IN BOOTS,On hearing this story the King instantly despatched one of his grooms
6032,PUSS IN BOOTS,"to fetch a handsome suit of purple and gold from the royal wardrobe,"
6033,PUSS IN BOOTS,"and arrayed in this, Jack, who was a fine, handsome fellow, looked"
6034,PUSS IN BOOTS,so well that no one for a moment supposed but that he was some noble
6035,PUSS IN BOOTS,foreign lord.
6036,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6037,PUSS IN BOOTS,The King and his daughter were so pleased with his appearance that
6038,PUSS IN BOOTS,"they invited him into their carriage. At first Jack hesitated, for he"
6039,PUSS IN BOOTS,"felt a little shy about sitting next to a Princess, but she smiled at"
6040,PUSS IN BOOTS,"him so sweetly, and was so kind and gentle, that he soon forgot his"
6041,PUSS IN BOOTS,fears and fell in love with her there and then.
6042,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6043,PUSS IN BOOTS,"As soon as Puss had seen his master seated in the royal carriage, he"
6044,PUSS IN BOOTS,"whispered directions to the coachman, and then ran on ahead as fast"
6045,PUSS IN BOOTS,"as he could trot, until he came to a field of corn, where the reapers"
6046,PUSS IN BOOTS,were busy.
6047,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6048,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Reapers,"" said he fiercely, ""the King will shortly pass this way. If"
6049,PUSS IN BOOTS,"he should ask you to whom this field belongs, remember that you say,"
6050,PUSS IN BOOTS,"'To the Marquis of Carabas.' If you dare to disobey me, I will have"
6051,PUSS IN BOOTS,"you all chopped up as fine as mincemeat."" The reapers were so afraid"
6052,PUSS IN BOOTS,the cat would keep his word that they promised to obey. Puss then
6053,PUSS IN BOOTS,ran on and told all the other laborers whom he met to give the same
6054,PUSS IN BOOTS,"answer, threatening them with terrible punishments if they disobeyed."
6055,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6056,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Now, the King was in a very good humor, for the day was fine, and he"
6057,PUSS IN BOOTS,"found the Marquis a very pleasant companion, so he told the coachman"
6058,PUSS IN BOOTS,"to drive slowly, in order that he might admire the beautiful country."
6059,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""What a fine field of wheat!"" he said presently. ""To whom does it"
6060,PUSS IN BOOTS,"belong?"" Then the men answered as they had been told: ""To our Lord the"
6061,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Marquis of Carabas."" Next they met a herd of cattle, and again to the"
6062,PUSS IN BOOTS,"King's question, ""To whom do they belong?"" they were told, ""To the"
6063,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Marquis of Carabas."" And it was the same with everything they passed."
6064,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6065,PUSS IN BOOTS,"The Marquis listened with the greatest astonishment, and thought what"
6066,PUSS IN BOOTS,a very wonderful cat his dear Puss was; and the King was delighted to
6067,PUSS IN BOOTS,find that his new friend was as wealthy as he was charming.
6068,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6069,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Meanwhile Puss, who was well in advance of the Royal party, had"
6070,PUSS IN BOOTS,"arrived at a stately castle, which belonged to a cruel Ogre, the"
6071,PUSS IN BOOTS,"richest ever known, for all the lands the King had admired so much"
6072,PUSS IN BOOTS,"belonged to him. Puss knocked at the door and asked to see the Ogre,"
6073,PUSS IN BOOTS,"who received him quite civilly, for he had never seen a cat in boots"
6074,PUSS IN BOOTS,"before, and the sight amused him."
6075,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6076,PUSS IN BOOTS,So he and Puss were soon chatting away together.
6077,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6078,PUSS IN BOOTS,"The Ogre, who was very conceited, began to boast of what clever tricks"
6079,PUSS IN BOOTS,"he could play, and Puss sat and listened, with a smile on his face."
6080,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6081,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""I once heard, great Ogre,"" he said at last, ""that you possessed the"
6082,PUSS IN BOOTS,power of changing yourself into any kind of animal you chose--a lion
6083,PUSS IN BOOTS,"or an elephant, for instance."""
6084,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6085,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Well, so I can,"" replied the Ogre."
6086,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6087,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Dear me! how much I should like to see you do it now,"" said Puss"
6088,PUSS IN BOOTS,sweetly.
6089,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6090,PUSS IN BOOTS,The Ogre was only too pleased to find a chance of showing how very
6091,PUSS IN BOOTS,"clever he was, so he promised to transform himself into any animal"
6092,PUSS IN BOOTS,Puss might mention.
6093,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6094,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Oh! I will leave the choice to you,"" said the cat politely."
6095,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6096,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Immediately there appeared where the Ogre had been seated, an enormous"
6097,PUSS IN BOOTS,"lion, roaring, and lashing with its tail, and looking as though it"
6098,PUSS IN BOOTS,meant to gobble the cat up in a trice.
6099,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6100,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Puss was really very much frightened, and, jumping out of the window,"
6101,PUSS IN BOOTS,"managed to scramble on to the roof, though he could scarcely hold on"
6102,PUSS IN BOOTS,to the tiles on account of his high-heeled boots.
6103,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6104,PUSS IN BOOTS,"There he sat, refusing to come down, until the Ogre changed himself"
6105,PUSS IN BOOTS,"into his natural form, and laughingly called to him that he would not"
6106,PUSS IN BOOTS,hurt him.
6107,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6108,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Then Puss ventured back into the room, and began to compliment the"
6109,PUSS IN BOOTS,Ogre on his cleverness.
6110,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6111,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Of course, it was all very wonderful,"" he said, ""but it would be more"
6112,PUSS IN BOOTS,"wonderful still if you, who are so great and fierce, could transform"
6113,PUSS IN BOOTS,"yourself into some timid little creature, such as a mouse. That, I"
6114,PUSS IN BOOTS,"suppose, would be quite impossible?"""
6115,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6116,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Not at all,"" said the vain Ogre; ""one is quite as easy to me as the"
6117,PUSS IN BOOTS,"other, as I will show you."" And in a moment a little brown mouse was"
6118,PUSS IN BOOTS,"frisking about all over the floor, whilst the Ogre had vanished."
6119,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6120,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""Now or never,"" said Puss, and with a spring he seized the mouse and"
6121,PUSS IN BOOTS,gobbled it up as fast as he could.
6122,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6123,PUSS IN BOOTS,At the same moment all the gentlemen and ladies whom the wicked Ogre
6124,PUSS IN BOOTS,"had held in his castle under a spell, became disenchanted. They were"
6125,PUSS IN BOOTS,so grateful to their deliverer that they would have done anything
6126,PUSS IN BOOTS,"to please him, and readily agreed to enter into the service of the"
6127,PUSS IN BOOTS,Marquis of Carabas when Puss asked them to do so.
6128,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6129,PUSS IN BOOTS,"So now the cat had a splendid castle, which he knew to be full of"
6130,PUSS IN BOOTS,"heaped-up treasures, at his command, and ordering a magnificent feast"
6131,PUSS IN BOOTS,"to be prepared, he took up his station at the castle gates to welcome"
6132,PUSS IN BOOTS,his master and the royal party.
6133,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6134,PUSS IN BOOTS,"As soon as the castle appeared in sight, the King enquired whose it"
6135,PUSS IN BOOTS,"was, ""For,"" said he, ""I have never seen a finer."""
6136,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6137,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Then Puss, bowing low, threw open the castle gates, and cried:"
6138,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6139,PUSS IN BOOTS,"""May it please your Majesty to alight and enter the home of the most"
6140,PUSS IN BOOTS,"noble the Marquis of Carabas."""
6141,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6142,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Full of surprise, the King turned to the Marquis. ""Is this splendid"
6143,PUSS IN BOOTS,"castle indeed yours?"" he asked. ""Not even our own palace is more"
6144,PUSS IN BOOTS,"beautiful, and doubtless it is as splendid within as without."""
6145,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6146,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Puss then helped his Majesty to alight, and conducted him into the"
6147,PUSS IN BOOTS,"castle, where a group of noble gentlemen and fair ladies were waiting"
6148,PUSS IN BOOTS,"to receive them. Jack, or the Marquis as he was now called, gave"
6149,PUSS IN BOOTS,"his hand to the young Princess, and led her to the banquet. Long and"
6150,PUSS IN BOOTS,"merrily they feasted, and when at length the guests rose to depart,"
6151,PUSS IN BOOTS,"the King embraced the Marquis, and called him his dear son; and the"
6152,PUSS IN BOOTS,"Princess blushed so charmingly and looked so shy and sweet, that Jack"
6153,PUSS IN BOOTS,ventured to lay his heart and fortune at her feet.
6154,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6155,PUSS IN BOOTS,"And so the miller's son married the King's daughter, and there were"
6156,PUSS IN BOOTS,great rejoicings throughout the land.
6157,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6158,PUSS IN BOOTS,"On the evening of the wedding-day a great ball was given, to which"
6159,PUSS IN BOOTS,princes and noblemen from far and near were invited. Puss opened the
6160,PUSS IN BOOTS,"ball, wearing for the occasion a pair of boots made of the finest"
6161,PUSS IN BOOTS,"leather, with gold tassels and scarlet heels. I only wish you could"
6162,PUSS IN BOOTS,have seen him.
6163,PUSS IN BOOTS,
6164,PUSS IN BOOTS,"When the old King died, the Princess and her husband reigned in his"
6165,PUSS IN BOOTS,"stead, and their most honored and faithful friend at Court was Puss"
6166,PUSS IN BOOTS,"himself, for his master never forgot to whom he owed all his good"
6167,PUSS IN BOOTS,"fortune. He lived upon the daintiest meat and most delicious cream,"
6168,PUSS IN BOOTS,"and was petted and made much of all the days of his life, and never"
6169,PUSS IN BOOTS,"again ran after mice and rats, except for exercise and amusement."

6179,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"There was once a shoemaker who, through no fault of his own, had"
6180,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,become so poor that at last he had only leather enough left for one
6181,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,pair of shoes. At evening he cut out the shoes which he intended to
6182,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"begin upon the next morning, and since he had a good conscience, he"
6183,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"lay down quietly, said his prayers, and fell asleep."
6184,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6185,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"In the morning when he had prayed, as usual, and was preparing to"
6186,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"sit down to work, he found the pair of shoes standing finished on his"
6187,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"table. He was amazed, and could not understand it in the least."
6188,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6189,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,He took the shoes in his hand to examine them more closely. They were
6190,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"so neatly sewn that not a stitch was out of place, and were as good"
6191,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,as the work of a master-hand.
6192,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6193,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"Soon after a purchaser came in, and as he was much pleased with the"
6194,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"shoes, he paid more than the ordinary price for them, so that the"
6195,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,shoemaker was able to buy leather for two pairs with the money.
6196,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6197,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"He cut them out in the evening, and next day, with fresh courage was"
6198,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"about to go to work; but he had no need to, for when he got up, the"
6199,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"shoes were finished, and buyers were not lacking. These gave him so"
6200,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,much money that he was able to buy leather for four pairs of shoes.
6201,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6202,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"Early next morning he found the four pairs finished, and so it went"
6203,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"on; what he cut out at evening was finished in the morning, so that he"
6204,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"was soon again in comfortable circumstances, and became a well-to-do"
6205,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,man.
6206,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6207,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"Now it happened one evening, not long before Christmas, when he had"
6208,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"cut out shoes as usual, that he said to his wife: ""How would it be"
6209,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,if we were to sit up to-night to see who it is that lends us such a
6210,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"helping hand?"""
6211,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6212,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"The wife agreed, lighted a candle, and they hid themselves in the"
6213,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,corner of the room behind the clothes which were hanging there.
6214,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6215,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"At midnight came two little naked men, who sat down at the shoemaker's"
6216,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"table, took up the cut-out work, and began with their tiny fingers"
6217,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"to stitch, sew, and hammer so neatly and quickly, that the shoemaker"
6218,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,could not believe his eyes. They did not stop till everything was
6219,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"quite finished, and stood complete on the table; then they ran swiftly"
6220,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,away.
6221,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6222,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"The next day the wife said: ""The little men have made us rich, and we"
6223,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"ought to show our gratitude. They run about with nothing on, and"
6224,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"must freeze with cold. Now I will make them little shirts, coats,"
6225,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"waistcoats, and hose, and will even knit them stout stockings, and you"
6226,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"shall make them each a pair of shoes."""
6227,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6228,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"The husband agreed, and at evening, when they had everything ready,"
6229,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"they laid out the presents on the table, and hid themselves to see how"
6230,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,the little men would behave.
6231,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6232,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"At midnight they came skipping in, and were about to set to work; but,"
6233,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"instead of the leather ready cut out, they found the charming little"
6234,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,clothes.
6235,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6236,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"At first they were surprised, then excessively delighted. With the"
6237,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"greatest speed they put on and smoothed down the pretty clothes,"
6238,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,singing:
6239,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6240,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"""Now we're dressed so fine and neat,"
6241,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"Why cobble more for others' feet?"""
6242,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,
6243,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"Then they hopped and danced about, and leaped over chairs and tables"
6244,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"and out at the door. Henceforward, they came back no more, but the"
6245,THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER,"shoemaker fared well as long as he lived, and had good luck in all his"

6256,HANS IN LUCK,Hans had served his master seven long years; so he said to him:
6257,HANS IN LUCK,"""Master, my time is out, and my wish is to return home to my mother:"
6258,HANS IN LUCK,"give me, if you please, my reward."""
6259,HANS IN LUCK,
6260,HANS IN LUCK,"The master answered: ""Thou hast truly and faithfully served me; as the"
6261,HANS IN LUCK,"service was, so shall the reward be."" And he gave Hans a piece of gold"
6262,HANS IN LUCK,as big as his head.
6263,HANS IN LUCK,
6264,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans pulled out his handkerchief, wrapped up the lump of gold in it,"
6265,HANS IN LUCK,"and, throwing it over his shoulder, made his way home. As he went"
6266,HANS IN LUCK,"on his way, always putting one foot before the other, he met a man"
6267,HANS IN LUCK,galloping briskly along on a fine horse.
6268,HANS IN LUCK,
6269,HANS IN LUCK,"""Ah!"" said Hans, quite aloud, ""what a capital thing it is to ride!"
6270,HANS IN LUCK,"There you sit as comfortably as in a chair, kicking against no stones,"
6271,HANS IN LUCK,"saving your shoe-leather, and getting to your journey's end almost"
6272,HANS IN LUCK,"without knowing it!"""
6273,HANS IN LUCK,
6274,HANS IN LUCK,"The horseman, who heard this, pulled up and cried, ""Hullo, Hans why do"
6275,HANS IN LUCK,"you trudge on foot?"""
6276,HANS IN LUCK,
6277,HANS IN LUCK,"""Because I must,"" answered he; ""for I have this big lump to carry"
6278,HANS IN LUCK,"home. It is real gold, you know; but, all the same, I can scarcely"
6279,HANS IN LUCK,"hold up my head, it weighs so terribly on my shoulders."""
6280,HANS IN LUCK,
6281,HANS IN LUCK,"""I'll tell you what,"" said the horseman: ""we'll just exchange. I'll"
6282,HANS IN LUCK,"give you my horse and you give me your lump of gold."""
6283,HANS IN LUCK,
6284,HANS IN LUCK,"""With all my heart!"" said Hans. ""But I warn you, you'll have a job to"
6285,HANS IN LUCK,"carry it."""
6286,HANS IN LUCK,
6287,HANS IN LUCK,"The horseman dismounted, took the gold, and helped Hans up; and,"
6288,HANS IN LUCK,"giving the bridle into his hand, said: ""If you want him to go at full"
6289,HANS IN LUCK,"speed, you must cluck with your tongue and cry 'C'ck! c'ck!'"""
6290,HANS IN LUCK,
6291,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans was heartily delighted, as he sat on his horse and rode gaily"
6292,HANS IN LUCK,along.
6293,HANS IN LUCK,
6294,HANS IN LUCK,"After a while he fancied he would like to go faster, so he began to"
6295,HANS IN LUCK,"cluck with his tongue and cry ""C'ck! c'ck!"" The horse broke into a"
6296,HANS IN LUCK,"smart trot, and before Hans was aware he was thrown off--splash!--into"
6297,HANS IN LUCK,"a ditch which divided the highway from the fields, and there he lay."
6298,HANS IN LUCK,"The horse, too, would have run away had it not been stopped by a"
6299,HANS IN LUCK,"peasant, as he came along the road, driving his cow before him."
6300,HANS IN LUCK,
6301,HANS IN LUCK,Hans pulled himself together and got upon his legs again. He felt very
6302,HANS IN LUCK,"downcast, and said to the peasant: ""It's a poor joke, that riding,"
6303,HANS IN LUCK,"especially when one lights upon such a brute as this, which kicks"
6304,HANS IN LUCK,and throws one off so that one comes near to breaking one's neck. You
6305,HANS IN LUCK,"don't catch me on his back again. Now, there's more sense in a cow"
6306,HANS IN LUCK,"like yours, behind which you can walk in peace and quietness, besides"
6307,HANS IN LUCK,"having your butter, milk, and cheese every morning for certain. What"
6308,HANS IN LUCK,"would I not give for such a cow!"""
6309,HANS IN LUCK,
6310,HANS IN LUCK,"""Well,"" said the peasant, ""if it would give you so much pleasure, I"
6311,HANS IN LUCK,"will exchange my cow for your horse."""
6312,HANS IN LUCK,
6313,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans gladly consented, and the peasant flung himself on the horse and"
6314,HANS IN LUCK,rode quickly off.
6315,HANS IN LUCK,
6316,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans drove the cow peacefully along, thinking: ""What a lucky fellow"
6317,HANS IN LUCK,I am! I have just to get a bit of bread (and that isn't a difficult
6318,HANS IN LUCK,"matter) and then, as often as I like, I can eat my butter and cheese"
6319,HANS IN LUCK,"with it. If I am thirsty, I just milk my cow and drink. What more"
6320,HANS IN LUCK,"could I desire?"""
6321,HANS IN LUCK,
6322,HANS IN LUCK,"When he came to an inn, he made a stop, and in his great joy ate all"
6323,HANS IN LUCK,"the food he had with him right up, both dinner and supper."
6324,HANS IN LUCK,
6325,HANS IN LUCK,"With his two last farthings, he bought himself half a glass of beer."
6326,HANS IN LUCK,Then he drove his cow towards his mother's village.
6327,HANS IN LUCK,
6328,HANS IN LUCK,"As the morning went on, the more oppressive the heat became, and Hans"
6329,HANS IN LUCK,found himself in a field some three miles long.
6330,HANS IN LUCK,
6331,HANS IN LUCK,"Then he felt so hot that his tongue was parched with thirst. ""This"
6332,HANS IN LUCK,"is soon cured,"" thought Hans. ""I have only to milk my cow, drink, and"
6333,HANS IN LUCK,"refresh myself."""
6334,HANS IN LUCK,
6335,HANS IN LUCK,"He tied the cow to a withered tree, and as he had no pitcher he placed"
6336,HANS IN LUCK,his leathern cap underneath her; but in spite of all his trouble not a
6337,HANS IN LUCK,drop of milk could be got.
6338,HANS IN LUCK,
6339,HANS IN LUCK,And he went to work so clumsily that the impatient brute gave him such
6340,HANS IN LUCK,"a kick with her hind leg that he was knocked over and quite dazed, and"
6341,HANS IN LUCK,for a long time did not know where he was.
6342,HANS IN LUCK,
6343,HANS IN LUCK,"Luckily a butcher came by just then, wheeling a young pig in a barrow."
6344,HANS IN LUCK,
6345,HANS IN LUCK,"""What kind of joke is this?"" cried he, helping our friend Hans to"
6346,HANS IN LUCK,rise.
6347,HANS IN LUCK,
6348,HANS IN LUCK,Hans told him what had happened. The butcher passed him his bottle and
6349,HANS IN LUCK,said:
6350,HANS IN LUCK,
6351,HANS IN LUCK,"""There, drink and revive yourself. That cow will never give any milk;"
6352,HANS IN LUCK,"she is an old animal and, at the best, is only fit for the plow or the"
6353,HANS IN LUCK,"butcher."""
6354,HANS IN LUCK,
6355,HANS IN LUCK,"""Oho!"" said Hans, running his fingers through his hair. ""Who would"
6356,HANS IN LUCK,have thought it? It is all right indeed when you can slaughter such a
6357,HANS IN LUCK,beast in your own house. But I don't think much of cow's flesh; it is
6358,HANS IN LUCK,"not tender enough. Now, if one had a young pig! That would taste far"
6359,HANS IN LUCK,"different, to say nothing of the sausages!"""
6360,HANS IN LUCK,
6361,HANS IN LUCK,"""Listen, Hans,"" said the butcher. ""For your sake, I will exchange, and"
6362,HANS IN LUCK,"let you have my pig for your cow."""
6363,HANS IN LUCK,
6364,HANS IN LUCK,"""May Heaven reward your friendship!"" said Hans, and at once gave him"
6365,HANS IN LUCK,the cow.
6366,HANS IN LUCK,
6367,HANS IN LUCK,"The man untied the pig from the wheelbarrow, and gave the rope with"
6368,HANS IN LUCK,which it was bound into Hans's hand.
6369,HANS IN LUCK,
6370,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans marched on, thinking: ""What a lucky fellow I am. As soon as"
6371,HANS IN LUCK,"anything goes wrong, something turns up and all's right again."""
6372,HANS IN LUCK,
6373,HANS IN LUCK,"Just then, up came a youth, carrying a fine white goose under his arm."
6374,HANS IN LUCK,"They were friends, and Hans began to talk about his luck and how"
6375,HANS IN LUCK,he always came off best in his exchanges. The youth told him he was
6376,HANS IN LUCK,taking the goose to a christening feast.
6377,HANS IN LUCK,
6378,HANS IN LUCK,"""Just hold it,"" he continued, seizing it by the wings, ""and feel how"
6379,HANS IN LUCK,heavy it is: yet it was only fattened for eight weeks. It will be a
6380,HANS IN LUCK,"rich morsel when roasted."""
6381,HANS IN LUCK,
6382,HANS IN LUCK,"""Yes,"" said Hans, weighing it with his hand, ""it is certainly heavy,"
6383,HANS IN LUCK,"but my pig is by no means to be despised."""
6384,HANS IN LUCK,
6385,HANS IN LUCK,"Meanwhile the lad was looking thoughtfully around, shaking his head."
6386,HANS IN LUCK,"""Listen,"" he said, ""I don't think it's all right about your pig. In"
6387,HANS IN LUCK,"the village I have just come through, one has lately been stolen from"
6388,HANS IN LUCK,the magistrate's own sty. I fear it is the one you have. They have
6389,HANS IN LUCK,"sent people out, and it would be a bad business if they found you with"
6390,HANS IN LUCK,"the pig. The least they would do would be to throw you into jail."""
6391,HANS IN LUCK,
6392,HANS IN LUCK,"Our friend Hans was downcast. ""Alas,"" he cried, ""help me in my need!"
6393,HANS IN LUCK,"You know your way here better than I. Take my pig then, and give me"
6394,HANS IN LUCK,"your goose."""
6395,HANS IN LUCK,
6396,HANS IN LUCK,"""I shall be running great risks,"" said the youth, ""but at least I will"
6397,HANS IN LUCK,"prevent your getting into trouble."""
6398,HANS IN LUCK,
6399,HANS IN LUCK,He took the rope in his hand and drove the pig quickly away down a
6400,HANS IN LUCK,"by-path, and Hans went on relieved of his sorrow, towards home, with"
6401,HANS IN LUCK,the goose under his arm.
6402,HANS IN LUCK,
6403,HANS IN LUCK,"""What a lucky fellow I am!"" he said to himself. ""First, I shall have a"
6404,HANS IN LUCK,"good roast; then there is the quantity of dripping that will fall out,"
6405,HANS IN LUCK,which will keep me in bread-and-dripping for a quarter of a year; and
6406,HANS IN LUCK,"lastly, the splendid white feathers, with which I will have my pillow"
6407,HANS IN LUCK,stuffed; then I shall fall asleep without rocking. How glad my mother

6409,HANS IN LUCK,
6410,HANS IN LUCK,"When he was at length come to the village, there stood in the street"
6411,HANS IN LUCK,"a scissors-grinder with his truck. His wheel hummed, and he sang the"

6413,HANS IN LUCK,
6414,HANS IN LUCK,"""My wheel I turn, and the scissors I grind,"
6415,HANS IN LUCK,"And my cloak hangs flowing free in the wind."""
6416,HANS IN LUCK,

6421,HANS IN LUCK,
6422,HANS IN LUCK,"""Yes,"" said the scissors-grinder; ""the work has gold at the bottom of"

6455,HANS IN LUCK,

6460,HANS IN LUCK,
6461,HANS IN LUCK,"""Now,"" said the grinder, lifting up an ordinary heavy field-stone,"
6462,HANS IN LUCK,"which lay beside him. ""There you have a capital stone, which will be"

6465,HANS IN LUCK,
6466,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans raised the stone and marched on with a joyful heart, his eyes"

6475,HANS IN LUCK,
6476,HANS IN LUCK,At length he could only proceed with great trouble and must needs stop
6477,HANS IN LUCK,"every minute; the stones, too, crushed him terribly. Then he could"

6480,HANS IN LUCK,
6481,HANS IN LUCK,"Like a snail he crept up to a well, wishing to rest himself and enjoy"

6483,HANS IN LUCK,
6484,HANS IN LUCK,"In order not to spoil the stones in setting them down, he laid them"
6485,HANS IN LUCK,"carefully on the ground one beside the other, and bent himself down to"
6486,HANS IN LUCK,"drink, but by an accident he gave them a little push, and both stones"
6487,HANS IN LUCK,went splashing down.
6488,HANS IN LUCK,
6489,HANS IN LUCK,"Hans, when he saw them sinking in the depths of the well, jumped up"

6491,HANS IN LUCK,"He had shown him this grace and, without troubling him to think what"

6563,BELLING THE CAT,Once upon a time the mice sat in council and talked of how they might
6564,BELLING THE CAT,"outwit their enemy, the Cat. But good advice was scarce, and in vain"
6565,BELLING THE CAT,the president called upon all the most experienced mice present to
6566,BELLING THE CAT,find a way.
6567,BELLING THE CAT,
6568,BELLING THE CAT,At last a very young mouse held up two fingers and asked to be allowed
6569,BELLING THE CAT,"to speak, and as soon as he could get permission he said:"
6570,BELLING THE CAT,
6571,BELLING THE CAT,"""I've been thinking for a long time why the Cat is such a dangerous"
6572,BELLING THE CAT,"enemy. Now, it's not so much because of her quickness, though people"
6573,BELLING THE CAT,"make so much fuss about that. If we could only _notice_ her in time,"
6574,BELLING THE CAT,I've no doubt we're nimble enough to jump into our holes before she
6575,BELLING THE CAT,"could do us any harm. It's in her velvet paws, there's where she hides"
6576,BELLING THE CAT,her cruel claws till she gets us in her clutches--that's where her
6577,BELLING THE CAT,power lies. With those paws she can tread so lightly that we can't
6578,BELLING THE CAT,"hear her coming. And so, while _we_ are still dancing heedlessly about"
6579,BELLING THE CAT,"the place, she creeps close up, and before we know where we are she"
6580,BELLING THE CAT,"pounces down on us and has us in her clutches. Well, then, it's my"
6581,BELLING THE CAT,opinion we ought to hang a bell round her neck to warn us of her
6582,BELLING THE CAT,"coming while there's yet time."""
6583,BELLING THE CAT,
6584,BELLING THE CAT,"Every one applauded this proposal, and the council decided that it"
6585,BELLING THE CAT,should be carried out.
6586,BELLING THE CAT,
6587,BELLING THE CAT,"Now the question to be settled was, who should undertake to fasten the"
6588,BELLING THE CAT,bell round the Cat's neck?
6589,BELLING THE CAT,
6590,BELLING THE CAT,The president declared that no one could be better fitted for the task
6591,BELLING THE CAT,than he who had given such excellent advice.
6592,BELLING THE CAT,
6593,BELLING THE CAT,But at that the young mouse became quite confused and stammered an
6594,BELLING THE CAT,"excuse. He was too young for the deed, he said. He didn't know the"
6595,BELLING THE CAT,"Cat well enough. His grandfather, who knew her better, would be more"
6596,BELLING THE CAT,suited to the job.
6597,BELLING THE CAT,
6598,BELLING THE CAT,But the grandfather declared that just because he knew the Cat very
6599,BELLING THE CAT,well he would take good care not to attempt such a task.
6600,BELLING THE CAT,
6601,BELLING THE CAT,And the long and the short of it was that no other mouse would
6602,BELLING THE CAT,"undertake the duty; and so this clever proposal was never carried out,"
6603,BELLING THE CAT,and the Cat remained mistress of the situation.

6613,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"In a great wide forest, full of beautiful trees, and green glades,"
6614,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"and thorny thickets, there lived a long time ago a wood-cutter and his"
6615,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"wife, who had only one child, a little girl. She was so pretty, and so"
6616,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"good, that the sun seemed to shine more brightly when its light fell"
6617,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"upon her rosy little face, and the birds would seem to sing more"
6618,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,sweetly when she was passing by.
6619,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6620,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,Her real name was Maisie; but the neighbors round about all called her
6621,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Little Red Riding-Hood,"" because of a scarlet riding-hood and cloak"
6622,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"that her kind old grandmother had made for her, and which she nearly"
6623,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,always wore.
6624,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6625,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"She was a happy, merry little child, with a smile and a gentle word"
6626,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"for everybody, and so you may easily believe that everybody loved her,"
6627,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,and was glad to catch a glimpse of her golden curls and her scarlet
6628,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"cloak as she tripped along, singing, under the green boughs."
6629,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6630,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Now, this, let me tell you before I forget, was at the time when all"
6631,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"the birds and beasts, or very nearly all, could speak just as well as"
6632,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"you or I; and nobody was surprised to hear them talk, as I suppose one"
6633,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,would be nowadays.
6634,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6635,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Well, as I was saying, Little Red Riding-Hood lived with her parents"
6636,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"in a little white cottage with a green door and a thatched roof, and"
6637,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"red and white roses climbing all over the walls, and even putting"
6638,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"their pretty heads in at the latticed windows, to peep at the child"
6639,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,who was so like them.
6640,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6641,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"It was on a bright spring morning early in May, when little Red"
6642,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,Riding-Hood had just finished putting away the breakfast-cups that her
6643,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,mother came bustling in from the dairy.
6644,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6645,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Here's a to-do,"" she said. ""Farmer Hodge has this very minute told"
6646,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"me that he hears your Grannie isn't quite well, and I can't leave the"
6647,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"cheese-making this morning for love or money! Do you go, my dear,"
6648,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,and find out how she is--and--stay--take her this little pot of sweet
6649,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"fresh butter, and these two new-laid eggs, and these nice tasty little"
6650,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"pasties. Maybe they'll tempt her to eat a bit. Here's your basket, and"
6651,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"don't be too long away, honey."""
6652,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6653,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"So little Red Riding-Hood pulled her hood over her curls, and set off"
6654,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"down the sunny green slope, with her basket in her hand, at a brisk"
6655,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"pace. But as she got deeper into the forest, she walked more slowly."
6656,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,Everything was so beautiful; the great trees waved their huge arms
6657,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"over her, the birds were calling to one another from the thorns all"
6658,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"white with blossom, and the child began singing as she went, she could"
6659,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"not have told why, but I think it was because the beautiful world made"
6660,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,her feel glad.
6661,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6662,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"The path wound along through the trees, and, as it grew wider after"
6663,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"turning a corner, Red Riding-saw that she was likely to have"
6664,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"company on her walk; for, where two cross-paths divided, there sat a"
6665,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"big gray wolf licking his long paws, and looking sharply about him."
6666,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"And ""Good morning, Red Riding-Hood,"" said he."
6667,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6668,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Good morning, Mr. Wolf,"" she answered."
6669,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6670,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""And where may you be going, sweet lass?"" said the Wolf, as he walked"
6671,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,beside her.
6672,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6673,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Oh, Grannie isn't very well, and mother cannot leave the"
6674,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"cheese-making this morning, and so I'm taking her some little dainties"
6675,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"in my basket, and I am to see how she is, and tell mother when I get"
6676,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"back,"" said the child with a smile."
6677,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6678,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""And,"" said the wolf, ""where does your good Grannie live, little"
6679,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"lady?"""
6680,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6681,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Through the copse, and down the hollow, and over the bridge, and"
6682,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"three meadows after the mill."""
6683,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6684,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Does she indeed?"" cried he. ""Why, then, I do believe she is a very"
6685,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"dear old friend of mine, whom I have not seen for years and years."
6686,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Now, I'll tell you what we'll do, you and I: I will go by this way,"
6687,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"and you shall take that, and whoever gets there first shall be the"
6688,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"winner of the game."""
6689,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6690,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"So the Wolf trotted off one way, and Red Riding-Hood went the other;"
6691,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,and I am sorry to say that she lingered and loitered more than she
6692,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,ought to have done on the road.
6693,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6694,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Well, what with one thing and another, the sun was right up in the"
6695,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,very mid-most middle of the sky when she crossed the last meadow from
6696,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"the mill and came in sight of her grandmother's cottage, and the big"
6697,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,lilac-bushes that grew by the garden gate.
6698,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6699,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Oh! dear, how I must have lingered!"" said the child, when she saw"
6700,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"how high the sun had climbed since she set out on her journey; and,"
6701,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"pattering up the garden-path, she tapped at the cottage door."
6702,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6703,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Who's there?"" said a very gruff kind of voice from inside."
6704,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6705,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""It's only I, Grannie dear, your little Red Riding-Hood with some"
6706,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"goodies for you in my basket, answered the child."
6707,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6708,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Then pull the bobbin,"" cried the voice, ""and the latch will go up."""
6709,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6710,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""What a dreadful cold poor Grannie must have, to be sure, to make her"
6711,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"so hoarse,"" thought the child. Then she pulled the bobbin, and the"
6712,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"latch went up, and Red Riding-Hood pushed open the door, and stepped"
6713,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,inside the cottage.
6714,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6715,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"It seemed very dark in there after the bright sunlight outside, and"
6716,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,all Red Riding-Hood could see was that the window-curtains and the
6717,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"bed-curtains were still drawn, and her grandmother seemed to be lying"
6718,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"in bed with the bed-clothes pulled almost over her head, and her great"
6719,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,white-frilled nightcap nearly hiding her face.
6720,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6721,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Now, you and I have guessed by this time, although poor Red"
6722,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Riding-Hood never even thought of such a thing, that it was not her"
6723,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Grannie at all, but the wicked Wolf, who had hurried to the cottage"
6724,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"and put on Grannie's nightcap and popped into her bed, to pretend that"
6725,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,he was Grannie herself.
6726,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6727,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"And where was Grannie all this time, you will say? Well, we shall see"
6728,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,presently.
6729,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6730,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Come and sit down beside my bed, dearie,"" wheezed the Wolf, ""and let"
6731,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"us have a little chat."" Then the Wolf stretched out his large hairy"
6732,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,paws and began to unfasten the basket.
6733,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6734,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""Oh!"" said Red Riding-Hood, ""what great arms you have, Grannie!"""
6735,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6736,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""All the better to hug you with,"" said the Wolf."
6737,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6738,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""And what great rough ears you have, Grannie!"""
6739,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6740,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""All the better to hear you with, my little dear."""
6741,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,

6743,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6744,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""All the better to see you with, my pet,"" grinned the Wolf."
6745,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6746,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""And oh! oh! Grannie,"" cried the child, in a sad fright, ""what great"
6747,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"sharp teeth you have!"""
6748,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6749,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""All the better to eat you with!"" growled the Wolf, springing up"
6750,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,suddenly at Red Riding-Hood. But just at that very moment the door
6751,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"flew open, and two tall wood-cutters rushed in with their heavy axes,"
6752,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,and killed the wicked Wolf in far less time than it takes me to tell
6753,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,you about it.
6754,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6755,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"""But where is Grannie?"" asked Little Red Riding-Hood, when she had"
6756,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"thanked the brave wood-cutters. ""Oh! where can poor Grannie be? Can"
6757,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"the cruel Wolf have eaten her up?"""
6758,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,
6759,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"And she began to cry and sob bitterly--when, who should walk in but"
6760,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"Grannie herself, as large as life, and as hearty as ever, with her"
6761,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,marketing-basket on her arm! For it was another old dame in the
6762,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,"village who was not very well, and Grannie had been down to visit her"
6763,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD,and give her some of her own famous herb-tea.

6777,THE NAIL,"A tradesman had once transacted a good day's business at a fair,"
6778,THE NAIL,"disposed of all his goods, and filled his purse with gold and silver."
6779,THE NAIL,"He prepared afterward to return, in order to reach home by the"
6780,THE NAIL,"evening, so he strapped his portmanteau, with the money in it, upon"
6781,THE NAIL,"his horse's back, and rode off. At noon he halted in a small town, and"
6782,THE NAIL,"as he was about to set out again, the stable-boy who brought his horse"
6783,THE NAIL,"said to him: ""Sir, a nail is wanting in the shoe on the left hind foot"
6784,THE NAIL,"of your animal."""
6785,THE NAIL,
6786,THE NAIL,"""Let it be wanting,"" replied the tradesman; ""I am in a hurry and the"
6787,THE NAIL,"iron will doubtless hold the six hours I have yet to travel."""
6788,THE NAIL,
6789,THE NAIL,"Late in the afternoon he had to dismount again, and feed his horse,"
6790,THE NAIL,and at this place also the boy came and told him that a nail was
6791,THE NAIL,"wanting in one of the shoes, and asked him whether he should take the"
6792,THE NAIL,"horse to a farrier. ""No, no, let it be!"" replied the master; ""it"
6793,THE NAIL,will last out the couple of hours that I have now to travel; I am in
6794,THE NAIL,"haste."" So saying he rode off; but his horse soon began to limp, and"
6795,THE NAIL,"from limping it came to stumbling, and presently the beast fell"
6796,THE NAIL,down and broke its leg. Thereupon the tradesman had to leave his
6797,THE NAIL,"unfortunate horse lying on the road, to unbuckle the portmanteau, and"
6798,THE NAIL,"to walk home with it upon his shoulder, where he arrived at last late"
6799,THE NAIL,at night.
6800,THE NAIL,
6801,THE NAIL,"""And all this misfortune,"" said he to himself, ""is owing to the want"

6812,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,Once upon a time there lived a poor widow who had an only son named
6813,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Jack. She was very poor, for times had been hard, and Jack was too"
6814,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,young to work. Almost all the furniture of the little cottage had been
6815,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"sold to buy bread, until at last there was nothing left worth selling."
6816,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Only the good cow, Milky White, remained, and she gave milk every"
6817,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"morning, which they took to market and sold. But one sad day Milky"
6818,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"White gave no milk, and then things looked bad indeed."
6819,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6820,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Never mind, mother,"" said Jack. ""We must sell Milky White. Trust me"
6821,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"to make a good bargain,"" and away he went to the market."
6822,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6823,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"For some time he went along very sadly, but after a little he quite"
6824,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"recovered his spirits. ""I may as well ride as walk,"" said he; so"
6825,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"instead of leading the cow by the halter, he jumped on her back, and"
6826,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,so he went whistling along until he met a butcher.
6827,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6828,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Good morning,"" said the butcher."
6829,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6830,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Good morning, sir,"" answered Jack."
6831,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6832,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Where are you going?"" said the butcher."
6833,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6834,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""I am going to market to sell the cow."""
6835,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6836,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""It's lucky I met you,"" said the butcher. ""You may save yourself the"
6837,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"trouble of going so far."""
6838,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6839,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"With this, he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out five"
6840,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"curious-looking beans. ""What do you call these?"" he said."
6841,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6842,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Beans,"" said Jack."
6843,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6844,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Yes,"" said he, ""beans, but they're the most wonderful beans that ever"
6845,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"were known. If you plant them overnight, by the next morning they'll"
6846,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,grow up and reach the sky. But to save you the trouble of going
6847,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"all the way to market, I don't mind exchanging them for that cow of"
6848,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"yours."""
6849,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6850,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Done!"" cried Jack, who was so delighted with the bargain that he ran"
6851,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,all the way home to tell his mother how lucky he had been.
6852,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6853,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,But oh! how disappointed the poor widow was.
6854,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6855,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Off to bed with you!"" she cried; and she was so angry that she threw"
6856,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,the beans out of the window into the garden. So poor Jack went to bed
6857,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"without any supper, and cried himself to sleep."
6858,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6859,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"When he woke up the next morning, the room was almost dark; and Jack"
6860,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,jumped out of bed and ran to the window to see what was the matter.
6861,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"The sun was shining brightly outside, but from the ground right up"
6862,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"beside his window there was growing a great beanstalk, which stretched"
6863,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"up and up as far as he could see, into the sky."
6864,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6865,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""I'll just see where it leads to,"" thought Jack, and with that he"
6866,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"stepped out of the window on to the beanstalk, and began to climb"
6867,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"upwards. He climbed up and up, till after a time his mother's cottage"
6868,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"looked a mere speck below, but at last the stalk ended, and he found"
6869,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,himself in a new and beautiful country. A little way off there was a
6870,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"great castle, with a broad road leading straight up to the front gate."
6871,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,But what most surprised Jack was to find a beautiful maiden suddenly
6872,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,standing beside him.
6873,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6874,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Good morning, ma'am,"" said he, very politely."
6875,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6876,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Good morning, Jack,"" said she; and Jack was more surprised than ever,"
6877,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,for he could not imagine how she had learned his name. But he soon
6878,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,found that she knew a great deal more about him than his name; for she
6879,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"told him how, when he was quite a little baby, his father, a gallant"
6880,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"knight, had been slain by the giant who lived in yonder castle, and"
6881,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"how his mother, in order to save Jack, had been obliged to promise"
6882,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,never to tell the secret.
6883,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6884,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""All that the giant has is yours,"" she said, and then disappeared"
6885,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,quite as suddenly as she came.
6886,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6887,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""She must be a fairy,"" thought Jack."
6888,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6889,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"As he drew near to the castle, he saw the giant's wife standing at the"
6890,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,door.
6891,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6892,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""If you please, ma'am,"" said he, ""would you kindly give me some"
6893,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"breakfast? I have had nothing to eat since yesterday."""
6894,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6895,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Now, the giant's wife, although very big and very ugly, had a kind"
6896,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"heart, so she said: ""Very well, little man, come in; but you must be"
6897,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"quick about it, for if my husband, the giant, finds you here, he will"
6898,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"eat you up, bones and all."""
6899,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6900,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"So in Jack went, and the giant's wife gave him a good breakfast, but"
6901,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,before he had half finished it there came a terrible knock at the
6902,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"front door, which seemed to shake even the thick walls of the castle."
6903,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6904,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Dearie me, that is my husband!"" said the giantess, in a terrible"
6905,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"fright; ""we must hide you somehow,"" and she lifted Jack up and popped"
6906,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,him into the empty kettle.
6907,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6908,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,No sooner had the giant's wife opened the door than her husband roared
6909,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,out:
6910,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6911,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Fee, fi, fo, fum,"
6912,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,I smell the blood of an Englishman;
6913,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Be he alive, or be he dead,"
6914,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"""
6915,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6916,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""It's a boy, I'm sure it is,"" he continued. ""Where is he? I'll have him"
6917,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"for my breakfast."""
6918,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6919,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Nonsense!"" said his wife; ""you must be mistaken. It's the ox's hide"
6920,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"you smell."" So he sat down, and ate up the greater part of the ox."
6921,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"When he had finished he said: ""Wife, bring me my money-bags."" So his"
6922,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"wife brought him two full bags of gold, and the giant began to count"
6923,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"his money. But he was so sleepy that his head soon began to nod, and"
6924,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"then he began to snore, like the rumbling of thunder. Then Jack crept"
6925,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"out, snatched up the two bags, and though the giant's dog barked"
6926,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"loudly, he made his way down the beanstalk back to the cottage before"
6927,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,the giant awoke.
6928,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6929,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,Jack and his mother were now quite rich; but it occurred to him one
6930,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,day that he would like to see how matters were going on at the giant's
6931,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"castle. So while his mother was away at market, he climbed up, and up,"
6932,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"and up, and up, until he got to the top of the beanstalk again."
6933,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6934,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"The giantess was standing at the door, just as before, but she did not"
6935,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"know Jack, who, of course, was more finely dressed than on his"
6936,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"first visit. ""If you please, ma'am,"" said he, ""will you give me some"
6937,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"breakfast?"""
6938,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6939,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Run away,"" said she, ""or my husband the giant will eat you up, bones"
6940,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,and all. The last boy who came here stole two bags of gold--off with
6941,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"you!"" But the giantess had a kind heart, and after a time she allowed"
6942,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Jack to come into the kitchen, where she set before him enough"
6943,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,breakfast to last him a week. Scarcely had he begun to eat than there
6944,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"was a great rumbling like an earthquake, and the giantess had only"
6945,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,time to bundle Jack into the oven when in came the giant. No sooner
6946,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,was he inside the room than he roared:
6947,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6948,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Fee, fi, fo, fum,"
6949,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,I smell the blood of an Englishman;
6950,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Be he alive, or be he dead,"
6951,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"""
6952,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6953,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"But his wife told him he was mistaken, and after breakfasting off"
6954,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"a roasted bullock, just as if it were a lark, he called out: ""Wife,"
6955,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"bring the little brown hen!"" The giantess went out and brought in a"
6956,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"little brown hen, which she placed on the table."
6957,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6958,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Lay!"" said the giant; and the hen at once laid a golden egg. ""Lay!"""
6959,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"said the giant a second time; and she laid another golden egg. ""Lay!"""
6960,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,said the giant a third time; and she laid a third golden egg.
6961,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6962,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""That will do for to-day,"" said he, and stretched himself out to go to"
6963,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"sleep. As soon as he began to snore, Jack crept out of the oven, went"
6964,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"on tiptoe to the table, and, snatching up the little brown hen, made"
6965,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"a dash for the door. Then the hen began to cackle, and the giant began"
6966,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"to wake up; but before he was quite awake, Jack had escaped from the"
6967,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"castle, and, climbing as fast as he could down the beanstalk, got safe"
6968,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,home to his mother's cottage.
6969,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6970,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,The little brown hen laid so many golden eggs that Jack and his mother
6971,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,had now more money than they could spend. But Jack was always thinking
6972,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"about the beanstalk; and one day he crept out of the window again, and"
6973,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"climbed up, and up, and up, and up, until he reached the top."
6974,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6975,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"This time, you may be sure, he was careful not to be seen; so he crept"
6976,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"round to the back of the castle, and when the giant's wife went out"
6977,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,he slipped into the kitchen and hid himself in the oven. In came the
6978,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"giant, roaring louder than ever:"
6979,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6980,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Fee, fi, fo, fum,"
6981,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,I smell the blood of an Englishman;
6982,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Be he alive; or be he dead,"
6983,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"""
6984,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6985,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,But the giantess was quite sure that she had seen no little boys
6986,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"that morning; and after grumbling a great deal, the giant sat down"
6987,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"to breakfast. Even then he was not quite satisfied, for every now and"
6988,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,again he would say:
6989,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6990,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Fee, fi, fo, fum,"
6991,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"I smell the blood of an Englishman;"""
6992,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6993,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"and once he got up and looked in the kettle. But, of course, Jack was"
6994,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,in the oven all the time!
6995,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
6996,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"When the giant had finished, he called out: ""Wife, bring me the golden"
6997,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"harp!"" So she brought in the golden harp, and placed it on the table."
6998,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"""Sing!"" said the giant; and the harp at once began to sing the most"
6999,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,beautiful songs that ever were heard. It sang so sweetly that the
7000,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,giant soon fell fast asleep; and then Jack crept quietly out of the
7001,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"oven, and going on tiptoe to the table, seized hold of the golden"
7002,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"harp. But the harp at once called out: ""Master! master!"" and the"
7003,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,giant woke up just in time to catch sight of Jack running out of the
7004,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,kitchen-door.
7005,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,
7006,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"With a fearful roar, he seized his oak-tree club, and dashed after"
7007,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"Jack, who held the harp tight, and ran faster than he had ever run"
7008,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"before. The giant, brandishing his club, and taking terribly long"
7009,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"strides, gained on Jack at every instant, and he would have been"
7010,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,caught if the giant hadn't slipped over a boulder. Before he could
7011,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"pick himself up, Jack began to climb down the beanstalk, and when the"
7012,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,giant arrived at the edge he was nearly half-way to the cottage. The
7013,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"giant began to climb down too; but as soon as Jack saw him coming, he"
7014,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"called out: ""Mother, bring me an axe!"" and the widow hurried out"
7015,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,with a chopper. Jack had no sooner reached the ground than he cut the
7016,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"beanstalk right in two. Down came the giant with a terrible crash, and"
7017,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"that, you may be sure, was the end of him. What became of the giantess"
7018,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,"and the castle nobody knows. But Jack and his mother grew very rich,"
7019,JACK AND THE BEANSTALK,and lived happy ever after.

7082,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"And all round the palace, for miles and miles, there were lovely"
7083,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"gardens and pleasure-grounds, with terraces and green lawns, and"
7084,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,ancient trees where the birds would sit and sing all day and all night
7085,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"long, and more flowers than you could ever think of if you were"
7086,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,to think a whole summer through. There were peacocks and birds of
7087,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"paradise on the broad lawns, and pretty slender brown deer in the"
7088,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"shady glades, and gold and silver fishes in the ponds and fountains,"
7089,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,and great red and yellow fruits ripened in the orchards.
7090,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7091,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"There was everything there that heart could wish--except just one,"
7092,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,and that was the one thing in all the world that this King and Queen
7093,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,wanted to make them perfectly happy. For there was no little child to
7094,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"run and play about the sunny gardens and pick the flowers, and pet the"
7095,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,birds and beasts that wandered there. And this would often make them
7096,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,very sad.
7097,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7098,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"But at last, after many years, they had their wish, and a little"
7099,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,baby daughter was born to them--a tiny child with a face like a blush
7100,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"rosebud, eyes like violets, and a little red mouth like the pimpernel"
7101,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,flowers that grow in the cornfields and by the wayside in summer-time.
7102,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7103,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Now, you can easily think how glad this King and Queen were, and what"
7104,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,great rejoicings were made over all the country.
7105,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7106,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Bonfires as big as haystacks were kept burning all night, fat oxen"
7107,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"were roasted whole in the market-place of every town, the church-bells"
7108,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,were rung and rung again until the ringers were out of breath and
7109,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"their arms were aching, and every little child in the kingdom was"
7110,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,given a beautiful present for the baby Princess's sake.
7111,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7112,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"In the palace, of course, all was bustle and hurry to make ready for"
7113,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,the christening-feast; the maids were busy putting flowers all
7114,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"about the halls and chambers, and sprinkling the shining floors with"
7115,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,sweet-smelling leaves and petals.
7116,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7117,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,For the most important guests invited to this christening were seven
7118,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"very powerful fairies, and you know, I am sure, how particular fairies"
7119,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,are about what they eat and drink. Not that they are greedy; but they
7120,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,are used to such delicate food that even the very best of ours seems
7121,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,strange to them. So the Queen was very anxious that they should
7122,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,be pleased; for they had been asked to be godmothers to the baby
7123,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Princess, and she wanted them to be in a good humor so that they"
7124,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,should be kind to her little one.
7125,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7126,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"It was a beautiful summer afternoon, and the roses on the palace"
7127,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"terrace were nodding their heads sleepily in the warm breeze, when the"
7128,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"fairies' chariots came into sight, sailing through the blue sky like a"
7129,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,flight of bright-winged butterflies.
7130,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7131,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"They were all good fairies, and had known the King and Queen all their"
7132,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"lives long, and as they had not seen them for some time there was"
7133,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"a great deal to talk about and much news to tell. And, dear me! how"
7134,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,pleased they were with the baby! They all agreed that she was the
7135,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,prettiest little darling they had ever seen--almost as pretty as a
7136,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"real fairy baby--and _that_ was a compliment indeed, I can tell you."
7137,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7138,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,And when they went in to the great banqueting-hall and sat down to
7139,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"table, they were even more delighted than at first. For each one of"
7140,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"them there was a set of six golden dinner things--knife, spoon, fork,"
7141,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"cup, dish, and plate--made on purpose as a present for each, and all"
7142,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"different. One was set with pearls, another with diamonds, the third"
7143,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"with rubies, the fourth with opals, the fifth with amethysts, the"
7144,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"sixth with emeralds, the seventh with sapphires; and nobody could tell"
7145,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,which was the most beautiful.
7146,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7147,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"They were just going to begin, and everybody was as happy as happy"
7148,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"could be, when, all of a sudden, there was a clashing of brazen claws"
7149,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"and a rushing of wings, and something like a black cloud seemed to"
7150,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"pass before the tall windows and darken all the room, so that the"
7151,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,guests could hardly see their plates. Then the great doors burst open
7152,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"with a terrible bang, and an old fairy in a long trailing black gown,"
7153,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"with her face almost hidden in a black hood, jumped out of a black"
7154,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"chariot drawn by fierce griffins, and stalked up to the table."
7155,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7156,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"The King turned pale, and the Queen nearly fainted away, for this"
7157,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"was the spiteful fairy Tormentilla, who lived all alone, an immense"
7158,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"distance away from everywhere and everyone, in a dismal black stone"
7159,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,castle in the middle of a desert. The poor Queen had been so happy and
7160,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"so busy that she had forgotten all about her, and never sent her an"
7161,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,invitation.
7162,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7163,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"However, they all tried to make the best of it, and another chair was"
7164,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"brought, and another place laid for Tormentilla; and both the King and"
7165,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Queen told her over and over again how very, very sorry they were not"
7166,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,to have asked her.
7167,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7168,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,It was all in vain. Nothing could please her; she would eat and
7169,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"drink nothing, and she sat, scowling and looking angrily at the other"
7170,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"fairies' jeweled cups and dishes, until the feast was over, and it was"
7171,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,time to give the presents.
7172,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7173,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Then they all went into the great tapestried room where the tiny
7174,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Princess lay sleeping in her mother-o'-pearl cradle, and the seven"
7175,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,fairies began to say what they would each give her.
7176,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7177,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"The first stepped forward and said: ""She shall always be as good as"
7178,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"gold""; the second: ""She shall be the cleverest Princess in the world"";"
7179,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"the third: ""She shall be the most beautiful""; the fourth: ""She shall"
7180,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"be the happiest""; the fifth: ""She shall have the sweetest voice that"
7181,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"was ever heard""; the sixth: ""Everyone shall love her."" And then the"
7182,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,wicked old cross fairy strode over to the cradle with long quick
7183,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"steps, and said, shaking her black crooked stick at the King and"
7184,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Queen: ""_And I say that she shall prick her hand with a spindle and"
7185,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"die of the wound_!"""
7186,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7187,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,At this the Queen fell on her knees and begged and prayed Tormentilla
7188,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"to call back her cruel words; but suddenly the seventh fairy, the"
7189,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"youngest of all, who knew Tormentilla well, and had hidden herself"
7190,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"behind the curtains for fear that some such thing might happen, came"
7191,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,out and said:
7192,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7193,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""Do not cry so, dear Queen; I cannot quite undo my cousin's wicked"
7194,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"enchantment, but I can promise you that your daughter shall not die,"
7195,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"but only fall asleep for a hundred years. And, when these are past and"
7196,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"gone, a Prince shall come and awaken her with a kiss."""
7197,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7198,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,So the King and Queen dried their tears and thanked the kind fairy
7199,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Heartsease for her goodness; and all the fairies went back to their
7200,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"homes, and things went on much as usual in the palace. But you can"
7201,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,imagine how careful the Queen was of her little girl; and the King
7202,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"made a law that every spindle in the country must be destroyed, and"
7203,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"that no more should be made, and that anyone who had a spindle should"
7204,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,be heavily punished if not executed at once.
7205,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7206,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Well, the years went by happily enough until the Princess Miranda was"
7207,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"almost eighteen years old, and all that the six fairies had promised"
7208,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"came true, for she was the best and the prettiest and the cleverest"
7209,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Princess in all the world, and everybody loved her. And, indeed, by"
7210,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,this time Tormentilla's spiteful words were almost forgotten.
7211,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7212,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""Poor old thing,"" the Queen would sometimes say, ""she was so angry"
7213,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,at having been left out that she did not know what she was saying. Of
7214,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"course, she did not really mean it."""
7215,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7216,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Now, the King and Queen had to go away for a few days to a great"
7217,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,entertainment that one of their richest nobles was giving at his
7218,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"country house; and, as the Princess did not wish to go, they left her"
7219,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,behind with her ladies-in-waiting in the beautiful old palace. For
7220,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"the first two days she amused herself very well, but on the third she"
7221,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"missed her father and mother so much that, to pass the time till"
7222,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"they came back, she began exploring all the old lumber-rooms and"
7223,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"out-of-the-way attics in the palace, and laughing at the dusty"
7224,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,furniture and queer curiosities she found there.
7225,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7226,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,At last she found herself at the top of a narrow winding stairway in
7227,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,a tall turret that seemed even older than all the rest of the palace.
7228,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,And when she lifted the latch of the door in front of her she saw
7229,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"a little low chamber with curiously painted walls, and there sat a"
7230,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"little old, old woman in a high white cap, spinning at a wheel."
7231,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7232,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"For some time she stood at the door, watching the old woman curiously;"
7233,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"she could not imagine what she was doing, for the Princess had never"
7234,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"seen a spinning-wheel in her life before, because, as I told you, the"
7235,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,King had ordered them all to be destroyed.
7236,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7237,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Now, it happened that the poor old woman who lived in this tower"
7238,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"had never heard the King's command, for she was so deaf that if"
7239,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,you shouted until you were hoarse she would never have been able to
7240,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,understand you.
7241,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7242,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""What pretty work you are doing there, Goody? And why does that wheel"
7243,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"go whirr, whirr, whirr?"" said the Princess. The old woman neither"
7244,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"answered nor looked up, for, of course, she did not hear."
7245,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7246,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,So the Princess stepped into the room and laid her hand upon the old
7247,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,woman's shoulder.
7248,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7249,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Goody started then, looked up, and rubbed her eyes."
7250,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7251,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""Deary, deary me!"" cried she, in a high, cracked voice. ""And who may"
7252,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"you be, my pretty darling?"""
7253,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7254,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"""I'm the Princess Miranda,"" screamed the maiden in her ear, but the"
7255,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,old woman only shook her head--she could hear nothing.
7256,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7257,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Then the Princess pointed to the spindle, and made the old woman"
7258,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,understand that she wanted to try if she could work it.
7259,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7260,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"So Goody nodded, and laughed, and got up from her seat, and the"
7261,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Princess sat down and took the spindle in her hand. But no sooner did
7262,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"she touch it than she pricked the palm of her hand with the point, and"
7263,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,sank down in a swoon.
7264,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7265,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Immediately a deep silence fell on all around. The little bird that
7266,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,only a moment before had been singing so sweetly upon the window-sill
7267,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,hushed his song. The distant hum of voices from the courtyard beneath
7268,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,ceased; even Goody stopped short in the directions she was giving
7269,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"the Princess, and neither moved hand nor foot towards the poor little"
7270,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"maid, and all because she had fallen fast asleep as she stood."
7271,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7272,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Below in the castle it was just the same. The King and Queen, who had"
7273,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,that moment returned from their journey and were enquiring for their
7274,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"daughter, fell asleep before the lady-in-waiting could answer them,"
7275,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,and as to the lady herself she had begun to snore--in a ladylike
7276,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"manner, of course--before you could have winked your eye."
7277,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7278,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,The soldiers and men-at-arms slumbered as they stood. The page-boy
7279,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"fell asleep writh his mouth wide open, and a fly that had just been"
7280,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,going to settle on his nose fell asleep too in mid-air.
7281,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7282,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Although the sun had been shining brightly when the Princess took the
7283,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"spindle in her hand, no sooner did she prick herself with the point"
7284,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,than deep shadows darkened the sunny rooms and gardens.
7285,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7286,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"It was just as though night had overtaken them, but there was no one"
7287,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,in or near the palace to heed whether it were dark or light.
7288,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7289,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,This sudden darkness had been caused by a magic wood which had sprung
7290,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,up all around the palace and its grounds. It was at least half a mile
7291,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"thick, and was composed of thorns and prickly plants, through which"
7292,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,it seemed impossible for anyone to penetrate. It was so thick and high
7293,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"that it hid even the topmost towers of the enchanted castle, and no"
7294,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,one outside could have dreamed that such a castle lay behind it.
7295,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7296,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Well, and so the years went on, and on, and on, until a hundred years"
7297,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"had passed, and the palace and the story of it were all but forgotten."
7298,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,And it happened that a King's son from a neighboring country came
7299,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"hunting that way with his men, and horses, and dogs. And in the"
7300,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,excitement of the chase he rode on and on until he became separated
7301,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"from his servants and attendants, and found himself in a part of the"
7302,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,country where he had never been before. In vain he tried to retrace
7303,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,his steps; he only seemed to wander farther away in the wrong
7304,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,direction.
7305,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7306,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Presently he came to a woodcutter's cottage, and dismounted to ask his"
7307,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"way. An old, old man lived in this hut, and after he had directed the"
7308,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Prince as to the best way back, the young man pointed to a thick wood"
7309,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"ahead, and asked what lay beyond it. Then the old man told him that"
7310,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,there was a legend that beyond the wood was an enchanted palace where
7311,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"a beautiful Princess had lain sleeping for a hundred years, and whom a"
7312,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,Prince was to awaken with a kiss.
7313,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7314,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Directly the Prince Florimond heard this, nothing would serve but he"
7315,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,must go there and see for himself if the tale were true. So he rode
7316,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"and he rode until he came to the edge of the wood, and there he got"
7317,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,off his horse and began to push his way through the thorny thicket. It
7318,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"was hard work indeed, for the briars were so strong and so sharp that"
7319,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"you would never believe that anyone could get past them, and they"
7320,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,closed up behind him as he went.
7321,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7322,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"But he was strong and brave, and after a time the way became easier,"
7323,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,until at last he came to the palace.
7324,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7325,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,There everyone was sleeping--the sentinels and soldiers in the
7326,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"court-yard, the cooks in the kitchen, and pages and lords and"
7327,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"ladies-in-waiting in the corridors and chambers; and, in the great"
7328,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,throne-room the King and Queen on their golden and ivory thrones.
7329,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7330,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Prince Florimond passed on, wondering more and more, till he came at"
7331,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,length to the narrow staircase which led to the little tower in which
7332,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"the Princess had fallen asleep. He mounted this, and then came the"
7333,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"greatest wonder of all--the beautiful sleeping lady, in her glistening"
7334,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,white robes. She was so beautiful that to see her almost took away his
7335,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"breath; and, falling on his knees, he bent to kiss her cheek. And as"
7336,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"he kissed her, she opened her lovely blue eyes and said, smiling: ""Oh!"
7337,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Prince, have you come at last? I have had such pleasant dreams."""
7338,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7339,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Then she sat up laughing and rubbing her eyes, and gave him her hand,"
7340,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,and they went hand in hand together down the stairs and along the
7341,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"corridors, till they came to the throne-room. And there were the King"
7342,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"and Queen rubbing their eyes too, and they kissed their daughter and"
7343,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,welcomed the Prince most gladly.
7344,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7345,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"And, all at the same time, the whole palace was awake. Cocks crowed,"
7346,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"dogs barked, the cats began to mew, the spits to turn, the clocks to"
7347,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"strike, the soldiers presented arms, the heralds blew their trumpets,"
7348,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"the head cook boxed a little scullion's ears, the butler went on"
7349,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"drinking his half-finished tankard of wine, the first lady-in-waiting"
7350,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,finished winding her skein of silk.
7351,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7352,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"Everything, in short, went on exactly as though the spell had lasted"
7353,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"a hundred seconds instead of years. To be sure, Princess Miranda's"
7354,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,pretty white dress was just such a one as Prince Florimond's
7355,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,great-grandmother might have worn. But that gave them something to
7356,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,laugh at.
7357,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,
7358,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"And now my story is done, for I need hardly tell you that the Prince"
7359,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"and Princess were married amid great rejoicings, and lived happily"
7360,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,ever after; and that the seven fairy godmothers danced at the wedding.
7361,THE SLEEPING BEAUTY,"So all ended well, and what more could anyone wish?"

7577,THE DEAD DOLL,You needn't be trying to comfort me--I tell you my dolly is dead!
7578,THE DEAD DOLL,"There's no use in saying she isn't, with a crack like that in her head."
7579,THE DEAD DOLL,"It's just like you said it wouldn't hurt much to have my tooth out,"
7580,THE DEAD DOLL,that day;
7581,THE DEAD DOLL,"And then, when the man 'most pulled my head off, you hadn't a word"

7583,THE DEAD DOLL,
7584,THE DEAD DOLL,"And I guess you must think I'm a baby, when you say you can mend it"

7586,THE DEAD DOLL,"As if I didn't know better than that! Why, just suppose it was you?"
7587,THE DEAD DOLL,You might make her look all mended--but what do I care for looks?

7589,THE DEAD DOLL,
7590,THE DEAD DOLL,"My dolly! my own little daughter! Oh, but it's the awfullest crack!"
7591,THE DEAD DOLL,It just makes me sick to think of the sound when her poor head went whack
7592,THE DEAD DOLL,Against that horrible brass thing that holds up the little shelf.
7593,THE DEAD DOLL,"Now, Nursey, what makes you remind me? I know that I did it myself!"
7594,THE DEAD DOLL,

7597,THE DEAD DOLL,And to think I hadn't quite finished her elegant new spring hat!
7598,THE DEAD DOLL,And I took a sweet ribbon of hers last night to tie on that horrid cat!

7600,THE DEAD DOLL,When my mamma gave me that ribbon--I was playing out in the yard--
7601,THE DEAD DOLL,"She said to me, most expressly, ""Here's a ribbon for Hildegarde."""

7604,THE DEAD DOLL,
7605,THE DEAD DOLL,"But I know that she knew it now, and I just believe, I do,"
7606,THE DEAD DOLL,"That her poor little heart was broken, and so her head broke too."
7607,THE DEAD DOLL,"Oh, my baby! my little baby! I wish my head had been hit!"
7608,THE DEAD DOLL,"For I've hit it over and over, and it hasn't cracked a bit."
7609,THE DEAD DOLL,
7610,THE DEAD DOLL,"But since the darling is dead, she'll want to be buried, of course:"
7611,THE DEAD DOLL,"We will take my little wagon, Nurse, and you shall be the horse;"
7612,THE DEAD DOLL,"And I'll walk behind and cry, and we'll put her in this, you see--"
7613,THE DEAD DOLL,This dear little box--and we'll bury her there out under the maple-tree.
7614,THE DEAD DOLL,
7615,THE DEAD DOLL,"And papa will make me a tombstone, like the one he made for my bird;"
7616,THE DEAD DOLL,"And he'll put what I tell him on it--yes, every single word!"

8011,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"'T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house"
8012,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;"
8013,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,"
8014,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
8015,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The children were nestled all snug in their beds,"
8016,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
8017,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,"
8018,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,--"
8019,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,"
8020,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
8021,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Away to the window I flew like a flash,"
8022,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
8023,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
8024,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Gave a lustre of midday to objects below;
8025,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"When what to my wondering eyes should appear,"
8026,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,"
8027,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"With a little old driver, so lively and quick"
8028,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
8029,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,"
8030,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And he whistled and shouted, and called them by name;"

8039,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof
8040,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
8041,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"As I drew in my head, and was turning around,"
8042,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
8043,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,"
8044,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
8045,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,"
8046,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
8047,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
8048,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;"
8049,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,"
8050,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
8051,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,"
8052,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
8053,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,He had a broad face and a little round belly
8054,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."
8055,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf;
8056,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And I laughed, when I saw him, in spite of myself."
8057,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
8058,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
8059,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,"
8060,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,"
8061,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And laying his finger aside of his nose,"
8062,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose."
8063,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,"
8064,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;
8065,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,"
8066,A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"""

8633,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"The turkeys, they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,"

9569,PART II,
9570,PART II,"The next time that good Mabel went,"
9571,PART II,There sat a lady bright

9573,PART II,All clothed in green and white.
9574,PART II,
9575,PART II,"A courtesy low made Mabel,"

9578,PART II,But no drop did she spill.
9579,PART II,
9580,PART II,"""Thou art a handy maiden,"""
9581,PART II,The fairy lady said;

9585,PART II,"""And for this thing which thou hast done,"

9594,PART II,
9595,PART II,"Thus having said, she passed from sight,"

9597,PART II,"But the little bird, the sky-blue bird,"
9598,PART II,Upon the leafy tree.
9599,PART II,
9600,PART II,"""And now go,"" said the grandmother,"
9601,PART II,"""And fetch in fagots dry;"
9602,PART II,All in the neighboring fir-wood
9603,PART II,"Beneath the trees they lie."""
9604,PART II,
9605,PART II,"Away went kind, good Mabel,"
9606,PART II,"Into the fir-wood near,"
9607,PART II,Where all the ground was dry and brown.
9608,PART II,And the grass grew thin and sear.
9609,PART II,
9610,PART II,"She did not wander up and down,"
9611,PART II,"Nor yet a live branch pull,"
9612,PART II,But steadily of the fallen boughs
9613,PART II,She picked her apron full.
9614,PART II,
9615,PART II,And when the wildwood brownies
9616,PART II,"Came sliding to her mind,"
9617,PART II,"She drove them thence, as she was told,"
9618,PART II,With home thoughts sweet and kind.
9619,PART II,
9620,PART II,But all that while the brownies
9621,PART II,"Within the fir-wood still,"
9622,PART II,"They watched her how she picked the wood,"
9623,PART II,And strove to do no ill.
9624,PART II,
9625,PART II,"""And, oh, but she is small and neat,"""
9626,PART II,"Said one; ""'t were shame to spite"
9627,PART II,"A creature so demure and meek,"
9628,PART II,"A creature harmless quite!"""
9629,PART II,
9630,PART II,"""Look only,"" said another,"
9631,PART II,"""At her little gown of blue;"
9632,PART II,"At her kerchief pinned about her head,"
9633,PART II,"And at her little shoe!"""
9634,PART II,
9635,PART II,"""Oh, but she is a comely child,"""
9636,PART II,"Said a third; ""and we will lay"
9637,PART II,"A good-luck penny in her path,"
9638,PART II,"A boon for her this day,--"
9639,PART II,Seeing she broke no living wood;
9640,PART II,"No live thing did affray!"""
9641,PART II,
9642,PART II,"With that the smallest penny,"
9643,PART II,"Of the finest silver ore,"
9644,PART II,"Upon the dry and slippery path,"
9645,PART II,Lay Mabel's feet before.
9646,PART II,
9647,PART II,"With joy she picked the penny up,"
9648,PART II,The fairy penny good;
9649,PART II,And with her fagots dry and brown
9650,PART II,Went wandering from the wood.
9651,PART II,
9652,PART II,"""Now she has that,"" said the brownies,"
9653,PART II,"""Let flax be ever so dear,"
9654,PART II,"'T will buy her clothes of the very best,"
9655,PART II,"For many and many a year!"""
9656,PART II,
9657,PART II,"""And go now,"" said the grandmother,"
9658,PART II,"""Since falling is the dew,"
9659,PART II,"Go down unto the lonesome glen,"
9660,PART II,"And milk the mother ewe!"""
9661,PART II,
9662,PART II,"All down into the lonesome glen,"
9663,PART II,"Through copses thick and wild,"
9664,PART II,"Through moist rank grass, by trickling streams,"
9665,PART II,Went on the willing child.
9666,PART II,
9667,PART II,"And when she came to the lonesome glen,"
9668,PART II,"She kept beside the burn,"
9669,PART II,And neither plucked the strawberry flower
9670,PART II,Nor broke the lady fern.
9671,PART II,
9672,PART II,And while she milked the mother ewe
9673,PART II,"Within this lonesome glen,"
9674,PART II,She wished that little Amy
9675,PART II,Were strong and well again.
9676,PART II,
9677,PART II,"And soon as she thought this thought,"
9678,PART II,"She heard a coming sound,"
9679,PART II,As if a thousand fairy folk
9680,PART II,Were gathering all around.
9681,PART II,
9682,PART II,"And then she heard a little voice,"
9683,PART II,"Shrill as the midge's wing,"
9684,PART II,"That spake aloud,--""A human child"
9685,PART II,"Is here; yet mark this thing,--"
9686,PART II,
9687,PART II,"""The lady-fern is all unbroke,"
9688,PART II,The strawberry flower unta'en!
9689,PART II,What shall be done for her who still
9690,PART II,"From mischief can refrain?"""
9691,PART II,
9692,PART II,"""Give her a fairy cake!"" said one;"
9693,PART II,"""Grant her a wish!"" said three;"
9694,PART II,"""The latest wish that she hath wished,"""
9695,PART II,"Said all, ""whate'er it be!"""
9696,PART II,
9697,PART II,"Kind Mabel heard the words they spake,"
9698,PART II,And from the lonesome glen
9699,PART II,Unto the good old grandmother
9700,PART II,Went gladly back again.
9701,PART II,
9702,PART II,Thus happened it to Mabel
9703,PART II,"On that midsummer day,"
9704,PART II,And these three fairy blessings
9705,PART II,She took with her away.
9706,PART II,
9707,PART II,"'T is good to make all duty sweet,"
9708,PART II,To be alert and kind;

9726,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9727,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And still he blew a louder blast,"

9736,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9737,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,That day Llewellyn little loved
9738,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"The chase of hart or hare,"
9739,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And scant and small the booty proved,"
9740,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,For Gelert was not there.
9741,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9742,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Unpleased, Llewellyn homeward hied,"
9743,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"When, near the portal seat,"
9744,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"His truant Gelert he espied,"
9745,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Bounding his lord to greet.
9746,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9747,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"But when he gained the castle door,"
9748,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Aghast the chieftain stood;
9749,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,The hound was smeared with gouts of gore
9750,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,His lips and fangs ran blood!
9751,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9752,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Llewellyn gazed with wild surprise;
9753,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Unused such looks to meet,"
9754,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"His fav'rite checked his joyful guise,"
9755,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And crouched, and licked his feet."
9756,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9757,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Onward in haste Llewellyn passed
9758,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"(And on went Gelert too),"
9759,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And still, where'er his eyes were cast,"
9760,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Fresh blood gouts shocked his view!
9761,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9762,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"O'erturned his infant's bed he found,"
9763,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,The blood-stained cover rent;
9764,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,And all around the walls and ground
9765,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,With recent blood besprent.
9766,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9767,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,He called his child--no voice replied;
9768,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,He searched with terror wild;
9769,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Blood! blood! he found on every side,"
9770,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,But nowhere found his child!
9771,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9772,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"""Hell-hound! by thee my child's devoured!"""
9773,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,The frantic father cried;
9774,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,And to the hilt his vengeful sword
9775,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,He plunged in Gelert's side.
9776,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9777,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"His suppliant, as to earth he fell,"
9778,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,No pity could impart;
9779,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,But still his Gelert's dying yell
9780,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Passed heavy o'er his heart.
9781,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9782,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Aroused by Gelert's dying yell,"
9783,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Some slumberer wakened nigh;
9784,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"What words the parent's joy can tell,"
9785,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,To hear his infant cry!
9786,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9787,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Concealed beneath a mangled heap,"
9788,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"His hurried search had missed,"
9789,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"All glowing from his rosy sleep,"
9790,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,His cherub boy he kissed!
9791,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9792,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Nor scratch had he, nor harm, nor dread,"
9793,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,But the same couch beneath
9794,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Lay a great wolf, all torn and dead,--"
9795,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Tremendous still in death!
9796,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9797,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Ah, what was then Llewellyn's pain!"
9798,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,For now the truth was clear;
9799,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"The gallant hound the wolf had slain,"
9800,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,To save Llewellyn's heir.
9801,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9802,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Vain, vain was all Llewellyn's woe;"
9803,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"""Best of thy kind, adieu!"
9804,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,The frantic deed which laid thee low
9805,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"This heart shall ever rue!"""
9806,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9807,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And now a gallant tomb they raised,"
9808,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,With costly sculpture decked;
9809,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,And marbles storied with his praise
9810,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Poor Gelert's bones protect.
9811,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9812,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Here never could the spearmen pass,"
9813,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"Or forester, unmoved,"
9814,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Here oft the tear-besprinkled grass
9815,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Llewellyn's sorrow proved.
9816,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,
9817,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And here he hung his horn and spear,"
9818,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,"And oft, as evening fell,"
9819,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,In fancy's piercing sounds would hear
9820,LLEWELLYN AND HIS DOG,Poor Gelert's dying yell.

10498,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10499,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers,"
10500,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,for they had all been born of one old tin spoon. They shouldered their
10501,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"muskets, and looked straight before them; their uniform was red and"
10502,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"blue, and very splendid. The first thing they had heard in the"
10503,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"world, when the lid was taken off their box, had been the words ""Tin"
10504,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"soldiers!"" These words were uttered by a little boy, clapping his"
10505,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hands: the soldiers had been given to him, for it was his birthday;"
10506,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and now he put them upon the table. Each soldier was exactly like the
10507,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"rest; but one of them had been cast last of all, and there had not"
10508,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,been enough tin to finish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg
10509,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,as the others on their two; and it was just this Soldier who became
10510,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,remarkable.
10511,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10512,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,On the table on which they had been placed stood many other
10513,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"playthings, but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat"
10514,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,castle of cardboard. Through the little windows one could see straight
10515,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,into the hall. Before the castle some little trees were placed round a
10516,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little looking-glass, which was to represent a clear lake. Waxen swans"
10517,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"swam on this lake, and were mirrored in it. This was all very pretty;"
10518,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"but the prettiest of all was a little lady, who stood at the open door"
10519,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of the castle; she was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress"
10520,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of the clearest gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her"
10521,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shoulders, that looked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon"
10522,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was a shining tinsel rose as big as her whole face. The little lady
10523,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"stretched out both her arms, for she was a dancer; and then she lifted"
10524,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"one leg so high that the Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and"
10525,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thought that, like himself, she had but one leg."
10526,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10527,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""That would be the wife for me,"" thought he; ""but she is very"
10528,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"grand. She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and there are"
10529,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,five-and-twenty of us in that. It is no place for her. But I must try
10530,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"to make acquaintance with her."""
10531,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10532,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And then he lay down at full length behind a snuff-box which was on
10533,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the table; there he could easily watch the little dainty lady, who"
10534,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,continued to stand upon one leg without losing her balance.
10535,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10536,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,When the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put into their
10537,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"box, and the people in the house went to bed. Now the toys began to"
10538,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"play at ""visiting,"" and at ""war,"" and ""giving balls."" The tin soldiers"
10539,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"rattled in their box, for they wanted to join, but could not lift the"
10540,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lid. The nutcracker threw somersaults, and the pencil amused itself on"
10541,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the table: there was so much noise that the canary woke up, and began"
10542,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"to speak too, and even in verse. The only two who did not stir from"
10543,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,their places were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady: she stood
10544,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"straight up on the point of one of her toes, and stretched out both"
10545,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,her arms; and he was just as enduring on his one leg; and he never
10546,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,turned his eyes away from her.
10547,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10548,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now the clock struck twelve--and, bounce! the lid flew off the"
10549,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"snuff-box; but there was no snuff in it, but a little black Goblin:"
10550,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"you see, it was a trick."
10551,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10552,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Tin Soldier!"" said the Goblin, ""don't stare at things that don't"
10553,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"concern you."""
10554,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10555,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.
10556,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10557,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Just you wait till to-morrow!"" said the Goblin."
10558,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10559,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But when the morning came, and the children got up, the Tin Soldier"
10560,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was placed in the window; and whether it was the Goblin or the draught
10561,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"that did it, all at once the window flew open, and the Soldier fell"
10562,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,head over heels out of the third story. That was a terrible passage!
10563,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He put his leg straight up, and stuck with helmet downward and his"
10564,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,bayonet between the paving-stones.
10565,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10566,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The servant-maid and the little boy came down directly to look for him,"
10567,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"but though they almost trod upon him, they could not see him. If the"
10568,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Soldier had cried out ""Here I am!"" they would have found him; but he"
10569,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"did not think it fitting to call out loudly, because he was in uniform."
10570,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10571,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last it came"
10572,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"down into a complete stream. When the rain was past, two street boys"
10573,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,came by.
10574,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10575,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Just look!"" said one of them: ""there lies a Tin Soldier. He must come"
10576,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"out and ride in the boat."""
10577,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10578,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin Soldier in"
10579,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the middle of it, and so he sailed down the gutter, and the two boys"
10580,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,ran beside him and clapped their hands. Goodness preserve us! how the
10581,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"waves rose in that gutter, and how fast the stream ran! But then"
10582,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"it had been a heavy rain. The paper boat rocked up and down, and"
10583,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,sometimes turned round so rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but
10584,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he remained firm, and never changed countenance, and looked straight"
10585,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"before him, and shouldered his musket."
10586,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10587,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"All at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as dark as"
10588,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,if he had been in his box.
10589,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10590,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Where am I going now?"" he thought. ""Yes, yes, that's the Goblin's"
10591,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fault. Ah! if the little lady only sat here with me in the boat, it"
10592,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"might be twice as dark for what I should care."""
10593,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10594,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Suddenly there came a great Water Rat, which lived under the drain."
10595,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10596,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Have you a passport?"" said the Rat. ""Give me your passport."""
10597,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10598,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But the Tin Soldier kept silence, and held his musket tighter than"
10599,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"ever. The boat went on, but the Rat came after it. Hu! how he gnashed"
10600,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"his teeth, and called out to the bits of straw and wood."
10601,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10602,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Hold him! hold him! He hasn't paid toll--he hasn't shown his"
10603,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"passport!"""
10604,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10605,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But the stream became stronger and stronger. The Tin Soldier could
10606,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,see the bright daylight where the arch ended; but he heard a roaring
10607,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"noise, which might well frighten a bolder man. Only think--just where"
10608,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the tunnel ended, the drain ran into a great canal; and for him that"
10609,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,would have been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great
10610,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,waterfall.
10611,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10612,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Now he was already so near it that he could not stop. The boat was
10613,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"carried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as much as he"
10614,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"could, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid. The boat whirled"
10615,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"round three or four times, and was full of water to the very edge--it"
10616,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"must sink. The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water, and the boat"
10617,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sank deeper and deeper, and the paper was loosened more and more; and"
10618,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,now the water closed over the soldier's head. Then he thought of the
10619,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"pretty little Dancer, and how he should never see her again; and it"
10620,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,sounded in the Soldier's ears:
10621,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10622,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Farewell, farewell, thou warrior brave,"
10623,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"For this day thou must die!"""
10624,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10625,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but at that"
10626,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,moment he was snapped up by a great fish.
10627,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10628,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Oh, how dark it was in that fish's body! It was darker yet than in"
10629,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the drain tunnel; and then it was very narrow too. But the Tin Soldier
10630,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"remained unmoved, and lay at full length shouldering his musket."
10631,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10632,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements, and"
10633,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,then became quite still. At last something flashed through him like
10634,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lightning. The daylight shone quite clear, and a voice said aloud,"
10635,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""The Tin Soldier!"" The fish had been caught, carried to market,"
10636,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"bought, and taken into the kitchen, where the cook cut him open with a"
10637,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,large knife. She seized the Soldier round the body with both her
10638,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hands and carried him into the room, where all were anxious to see the"
10639,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,remarkable man who had traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the
10640,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Tin Soldier was not at all proud. They placed him on the table,"
10641,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and there--no! What curious things may happen in the world. The Tin
10642,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Soldier was in the very room in which he had been before! he saw the
10643,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"same children, and the same toys stood on the table; and there was the"
10644,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,pretty castle with the graceful little Dancer. She was still balancing
10645,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"herself on one leg, and held the other extended in the air. She was"
10646,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,hardy too. That moved the Tin Soldier; he was very nearly weeping tin
10647,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tears, but that would not have been proper. He looked at her, but they"
10648,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,said nothing to each other.
10649,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10650,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung him into
10651,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the stove. He gave no reason for doing this. It must have been the
10652,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,fault of the Goblin in the snuff-box.
10653,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10654,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a heat that"
10655,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was terrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or
10656,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,from love he did not know. The colors had quite gone off from him; but
10657,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"whether that had happened on the journey, or had been caused by grief,"
10658,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"no one could say. He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and"
10659,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he felt that he was melting; but he still stood firm, shouldering"
10660,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"his musket. Then suddenly the door flew open, and the draught of air"
10661,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"caught the Dancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to"
10662,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the Tin Soldier, and flashed up in a flame, and she was gone. Then the"
10663,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Tin Soldier melted down into a lump; and when the servant-maid took
10664,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the ashes out next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin"
10665,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"heart. But of the Dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, and"
10666,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,that was burned as black as a coal.

10676,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10677,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10678,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Out in the forest stood a pretty little Fir Tree. It had a good place;
10679,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"it could have sunlight, air there was in plenty, and all around grew"
10680,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,many larger comrades--pines as well as firs. But the little Fir Tree
10681,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,wished ardently to become greater. It did not care for the warm sun
10682,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and the fresh air; it took no notice of the peasant children, who"
10683,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"went about talking together, when they had come out to look for"
10684,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"strawberries and raspberries. Often they came with a whole pot-full,"
10685,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,or had strung berries on a straw; then they would sit down by the
10686,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little Fir Tree and say, ""How pretty and small that one is!"" and the"
10687,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Fir Tree did not like to hear that at all.
10688,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10689,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Next year he had grown a great joint, and the following year he was"
10690,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"longer still, for in fir trees one can always tell by the number of"
10691,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,rings they have how many years they have been growing.
10692,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10693,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh, if I were only as great a tree as the other!"" sighed the little"
10694,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Fir, ""then I would spread my branches far around, and look out from"
10695,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,my crown into the wide world. The birds would then build nests in
10696,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"my boughs, and when the wind blew I could nod just as grandly as the"
10697,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"others yonder."""
10698,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10699,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It took no pleasure in the sunshine, in the birds, and in the red"
10700,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,clouds that went sailing over him morning and evening.
10701,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10702,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When it was winter, and the snow lay all around, white and sparkling,"
10703,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"a hare would often come jumping along, and spring right over the"
10704,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little Fir Tree. Oh! this made him so angry. But two winters went by,"
10705,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and when the third came the little Tree had grown so tall that the
10706,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,hare was obliged to run round it.
10707,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10708,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh! to grow, to grow, and become old; that's the only fine thing in"
10709,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the world,"" thought the Tree."
10710,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10711,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,In the autumn woodcutters always came and felled a few of the largest
10712,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"trees; that was done this year too, and the little Fir Tree, that was"
10713,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"now quite well grown, shuddered with fear, for the great stately trees"
10714,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fell to the ground with a crash, and their branches were cut off,"
10715,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"so that the trees looked quite naked, long, and slender--they could"
10716,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hardly be recognized. But then they were laid upon wagons, and horses"
10717,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,dragged them away out of the wood. Where were they going? What destiny
10718,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,awaited them?
10719,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10720,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"In the spring, when the Swallows and the Stork came, the Tree asked"

10722,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10723,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The Swallows knew nothing about it, but the Stork looked thoughtful,"
10724,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"nodded his head, and said:"
10725,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10726,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Yes, I think so. I met many new ships when I flew out of Egypt; on"
10727,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the ships were stately masts; I fancy these were the trees. They smelt
10728,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"like fir. I can assure you they're stately--very stately."""
10729,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10730,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh that I were only big enough to go over the sea! What kind of thing"

10732,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10733,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""It would take too long to explain all that,"" said the Stork, and he"
10734,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,went away.
10735,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10736,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Rejoice in thy youth,"" said the Sunbeams; ""rejoice in thy fresh"

10739,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And the Wind kissed the Tree, and the Dew wept tears upon it; but the"

10741,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10742,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When Christmas-time approached, quite young trees were felled,"
10743,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,sometimes trees which were neither so old nor so large as this Fir

10748,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10749,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Where are they all going?"" asked the Fir Tree. ""They are not greater"

10752,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10753,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""We know that! We know that!"" chirped the Sparrows. ""Yonder in the"

10775,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"myself what is the matter with me!"""
10776,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10777,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Rejoice in us,"" said Air and Sunshine. ""Rejoice in thy fresh youth"
10778,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"here in the woodland."""
10779,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10780,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But the Fir Tree did not rejoice at all, but it grew and grew; winter"
10781,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and summer it stood there, green, dark green. The people who saw it"
10782,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"said, ""That's a handsome tree!"" and at Christmas time it was felled"
10783,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"before any one of the others. The axe cut deep into its marrow, and"
10784,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the tree fell to the ground with a sigh; it felt a pain, a sensation"
10785,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of faintness, and could not think at all of happiness, for it was sad"
10786,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"at parting from its home, from the place where it had grown up; it"
10787,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"knew that it should never again see the dear old companions, the"
10788,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little bushes and flowers all around--perhaps not even the birds. The
10789,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,parting was not at all agreeable.
10790,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10791,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The Tree only came to itself when it was unloaded in a yard, with"
10792,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"other trees, and heard a man say:"
10793,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10794,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""This one is famous; we only want this one!"""
10795,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10796,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now two servants came in gay liveries, and carried the Fir Tree into"
10797,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"a large, beautiful parlor. All around the walls hung pictures, and by"
10798,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the great stove stood large Chinese vases with lions on the covers;
10799,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there were rocking-chairs, silken sofas, great tables covered with"
10800,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"picture books, and toys worth a hundred times a hundred dollars, at"
10801,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,least the children said so. And the Fir Tree was put into a great tub
10802,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"filled with sand; but no one could see that it was a tub, for it"
10803,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was hung round with green cloth, and stood on a large, many-colored"
10804,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"carpet. Oh, how the Tree trembled! What was to happen now? The"
10805,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"servants, and the young ladies also, decked it out. On one branch they"
10806,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hung little nets, cut out of colored paper; every net was filled"
10807,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"with sweetmeats; golden apples and walnuts hung down, as if they grew"
10808,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there, and more than a hundred little candles, red, white, and blue,"
10809,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,were fastened to the different boughs. Dolls that looked exactly like
10810,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,real people--the tree had never seen such before--swung among the
10811,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"foliage, and high on the summit of the tree was fixed a tinsel star."
10812,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It was splendid, particularly splendid."
10813,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10814,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""This evening,"" said all, ""this evening it will shine."""
10815,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10816,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh,"" thought the Tree, ""that it were evening already! Oh, that the"
10817,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,lights may be soon lit up! When may that be done? I wonder if trees
10818,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,will come out of the forest to look at me? Will the sparrows fly
10819,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"against the panes? Shall I grow fast here, and stand adorned in"
10820,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"summer and winter?"""
10821,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10822,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Yes, he did not guess badly. But he had a complete backache from"
10823,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"mere longing, and the backache is just as bad for a Tree as the"
10824,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,headache for a person.
10825,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10826,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"At last the candles were lighted. What a brilliance, what splendor!"
10827,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The Tree trembled so in all its branches that one of the candles set
10828,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fire to a green twig, and it was scorched."
10829,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10830,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Heaven preserve us!"" cried the young ladies; and they hastily put the"
10831,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,fire out.
10832,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10833,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now the Tree might not even tremble. Oh, that was terrible! It was"
10834,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"so afraid of setting fire to some of its ornaments, and it was quite"
10835,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,bewildered with all the brilliance. And now the folding doors were
10836,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thrown open, and a number of children rushed in as if they would"
10837,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,have overturned the whole Tree; the older people followed more
10838,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"deliberately. The little ones stood quite silent, but only for a"
10839,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,minute; then they shouted till the room rang: they danced gleefully
10840,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"round the Tree, and one present after another was plucked from it."
10841,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10842,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What are they about?"" thought the Tree. ""What's going to be done?"""
10843,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10844,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And the candles burned down to the twigs, and as they burned down"
10845,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"they were extinguished, and then the children received permission to"
10846,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"plunder the Tree. Oh! they rushed in upon it, so that every branch"
10847,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,cracked again: if it had not been fastened by the top and by the
10848,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"golden star to the ceiling, it would have fallen down."
10849,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10850,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The children danced about with their pretty toys. No one looked at the
10851,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Tree except one old man, who came up and peeped among the branches,"
10852,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,but only to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten.
10853,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10854,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""A story! A story!"" shouted the children; and they drew a little fat"
10855,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"man toward the tree; and he sat down just beneath it--""for then we"
10856,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shall be in the green wood,"" said he, ""and the tree may have the"
10857,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,advantage of listening to my tale. But I can only tell one. Will
10858,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"you hear the story of Ivede-Avede, or of Klumpey-Dumpey, who"
10859,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fell downstairs, and still was raised up to honor and married the"
10860,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess?"""
10861,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10862,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Ivede-Avede!"" cried some, ""Klumpey-Dumpey!"" cried others, and there"
10863,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was a great crying and shouting. Only the Fir Tree was quite silent,"
10864,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and thought, ""Shall I not be in it? Shall I have nothing to do in"
10865,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"it?"" But he had been in the evening's amusement, and had done what was"
10866,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,required of him.
10867,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10868,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And the fat man told about Klumpey-Dumpey who fell downstairs, and yet"
10869,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was raised to honor and married the Princess. And the children clapped
10870,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"their hands, and cried, ""Tell another! tell another!"" for they"
10871,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,wanted to hear about Ivede-Avede; but they only got the story of
10872,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Klumpey-Dumpey. The Fir Tree stood quite silent and thoughtful; never
10873,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,had the birds in the wood told such a story as that. Klumpey-Dumpey
10874,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,fell downstairs and yet came to honor and married the Princess!
10875,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10876,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Yes, so it happens in the world!"" thought the Fir Tree, and believed"
10877,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"it must be true, because that was such a nice man who told it. ""Well,"
10878,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"who can know? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs, too, and marry a"
10879,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess!"" And it looked forward with pleasure to being adorned again,"
10880,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the next evening, with candles and toys, gold and fruit. ""To-morrow I"
10881,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shall not tremble,"" it thought."
10882,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10883,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I will rejoice in all my splendor. To-morrow I shall here the story"
10884,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of Klumpey-Dumpey again, and perhaps that of Ivede-Avede, too."""
10885,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10886,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the Tree stood all night quiet and thoughtful.
10887,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10888,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,In the morning the servants and the chambermaid came in.
10889,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10890,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now my splendor will begin afresh,"" thought the Tree. But they"
10891,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dragged him out of the room, and upstairs to the garret, and here they"
10892,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,put him in a dark corner where no daylight shone.
10893,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10894,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What's the meaning of this?"" thought the Tree. ""What am I to do here?"
10895,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"What is to happen?"""
10896,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10897,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And he leaned against the wall, and thought, and thought. And he had"
10898,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"time enough, for days and nights went by, and nobody came up; and"
10899,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"when at length some one came, it was only to put some great boxes in"
10900,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"a corner. Now the Tree stood quite hidden away, and the supposition is"
10901,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,that it was quite forgotten.
10902,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10903,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now it's winter outside,"" thought the Tree. ""The earth is hard and"
10904,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"covered with snow, and people cannot plant me; therefore I suppose I'm"
10905,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,to be sheltered here until spring comes. How considerate that is! How
10906,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"good people are! If it were only not so dark here, and so terribly"
10907,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,solitary!--not even a little hare? That was pretty out there in the
10908,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wood, when the snow lay thick and the hare sprang past; yes, even when"
10909,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,he jumped over me; but then I did not like it. It is terribly lonely
10910,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"up here!"""
10911,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10912,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Piep! piep!"" said a little Mouse, and crept forward, and then came"
10913,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"another little one. They smelt at the Fir Tree, and then slipped among"
10914,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the branches.
10915,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10916,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""It's horribly cold,"" said the two little Mice, ""or else it would be"
10917,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"comfortable here. Don't you think so, you old Fir Tree?"""
10918,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10919,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I'm not old at all,"" said the Fir Tree. ""There are many much older"
10920,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"than I."""
10921,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10922,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Where do you come from?"" asked the Mice. ""And what do you know?"" They"
10923,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"were dreadfully inquisitive. ""Tell us about the most beautiful spot"
10924,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"on earth. Have you been there? Have you been in the store room, where"
10925,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"cheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one"
10926,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dances on tallow candles, and goes in thin and comes out fat?"""
10927,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10928,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I don't know that,"" replied the Tree; ""but I know the wood, where the"
10929,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sun shines and the birds sing."""
10930,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10931,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And then it told all about its youth.
10932,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10933,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the little Mice had never heard anything of the kind; and they
10934,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,listened and said:
10935,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10936,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What a number of things you have seen! How happy you must have been!"""
10937,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10938,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I?"" replied the Fir Tree; and it thought about what it had told."
10939,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Yes, those were really quite happy times."" But then he told of the"
10940,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Christmas Eve, when he had been hung with sweetmeats and candles."
10941,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10942,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh!"" said the little Mice, ""how happy you have been, you old Fir"
10943,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Tree!"""
10944,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10945,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I'm not old at all,"" said the Tree. ""I only came out of the wood this"
10946,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"winter. I'm only rather backward in my growth."""
10947,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10948,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What splendid stories you can tell!"" said the little Mice."
10949,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10950,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And next night they came with four other little Mice, to hear what"
10951,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the Tree had to relate; and the more it said, the more clearly did it"
10952,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"remember everything, and thought, ""Those were quite merry days! But"
10953,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,they may come again. Klumpey-Dumpey fell downstairs and yet he married
10954,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the Princess. Perhaps I may marry a Princess too?"" And then the"
10955,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Fir Tree thought of a pretty little Birch Tree that grew out in the
10956,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"forest: for the Fir Tree, that Birch was a real Princess."
10957,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10958,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Who's Klumpey-Dumpey?"" asked the little Mice."
10959,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10960,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And then the Fir Tree told the whole story. It could remember every
10961,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,single word; and the little Mice were ready to leap to the very top of
10962,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the tree with pleasure. Next night a great many more Mice came, and"
10963,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,on Sunday two Rats even appeared; but these thought the story was not
10964,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"pretty, and the little Mice were sorry for that, for now they also did"
10965,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,not like it so much as before.
10966,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10967,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Do you only know one story?"" asked the Rats."
10968,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10969,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Only that one,"" replied the Tree. ""I heard that on the happiest"
10970,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"evening of my life; I did not think then how happy I was."""
10971,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10972,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""That's a very miserable story. Don't you know any about bacon and"
10973,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tallow candles--a store-room story?"""
10974,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10975,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""No,"" said the Tree."
10976,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10977,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Then we'd rather not hear you,"" said the Rats."
10978,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10979,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And they went back to their own people. The little Mice at last stayed
10980,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,away also; and then the Tree sighed and said:
10981,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10982,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""It was very nice when they sat round me, the merry little Mice,"
10983,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and listened when I spoke to them. Now that's past too. But I shall
10984,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"remember to be pleased when they take me out."""
10985,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10986,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But when did that happen? Why, it was one morning that people came and"
10987,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"rummaged in the garret; the boxes were put away, and the Tree brought"
10988,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"out; they certainly threw him rather roughly on the floor, but a"
10989,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"servant dragged him away at once to the stairs, where the daylight"
10990,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,shone.
10991,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10992,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now life is beginning again!"" thought the Tree."
10993,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
10994,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It felt the fresh air and the first sunbeams, and now it was out in"
10995,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the courtyard. Everything passed so quickly that the Tree quite
10996,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"forgot to look at itself, there was so much to look at all round. The"
10997,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"courtyard was close to a garden, and here everything was blooming; the"
10998,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"roses hung fresh and fragrant over the little paling, the linden trees"
10999,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"were in blossom, and the swallows cried, ""Quinze-wit! quinze-wit! my"
11000,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"husband's come!"" But it was not the Fir Tree that they meant."
11001,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11002,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now I shall live!"" said the Tree, rejoicingly, and spread its"
11003,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"branches far out; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it"
11004,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,lay in the corner among nettles and weeds. The tinsel star was still
11005,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"upon it, and shone in the bright sunshine."
11006,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11007,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,In the courtyard a couple of the merry children were playing who had
11008,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"danced round the tree at Christmas time, and had rejoiced over it. One"
11009,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,of the youngest ran up and tore off the golden star.
11010,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11011,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree!"" said the child, and"
11012,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,he trod upon the branches till they cracked again under his boots.
11013,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11014,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the Tree looked at all the blooming flowers and the splendor of
11015,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in"
11016,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the dark corner of the garret; it thought of its fresh youth in the
11017,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wood, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice which had"
11018,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,listened so pleasantly to the story of Klumpey-Dumpey.
11019,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11020,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Past! past!"" said the old Tree. ""Had I but rejoiced when I could have"
11021,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"done so! Past! past!"""
11022,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11023,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces; a whole
11024,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"bundle lay there; it blazed brightly under the great brewing kettle,"
11025,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and it sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a little shot; and the"
11026,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,children who were at play there ran up and seated themselves at the
11027,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fire, looked into it, and cried ""Puff! puff!"" But at each explosion,"
11028,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"which was a deep sigh, the Tree thought of a summer day in the woods,"
11029,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"or of a winter night there, when the stars beamed; he thought of"
11030,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Christmas Eve and of Klumpey-Dumpey, the only story he had ever heard"
11031,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,or knew how to tell; and then the Tree was burned.
11032,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11033,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The boys played in the garden, and the youngest had on his breast a"
11034,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"golden star, which the Tree had worn on its happiest evening. Now that"
11035,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was past, and the Tree's life was past, and the story is past too:"
11036,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,past! past!--and that's the way with all stories.

11046,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There was once a Darning-needle, who thought herself so fine, she"
11047,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,imagined she was an embroidering-needle.
11048,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11049,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Take care, and mind you hold me tight!"" she said to the Fingers that"
11050,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"took her out. ""Don't let me fall! If I fall on the ground I shall"
11051,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"certainly never be found again, for I am so fine!"""
11052,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11053,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""That's as it may be,"" said the Fingers; and they grasped her round"
11054,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the body.
11055,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11056,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""See, I'm coming with a train!"" said the Darning-needle, and she drew"
11057,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"a long thread after her, but there was no knot in the thread."
11058,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11059,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The Fingers pointed the needle just at the cook's slipper, in which"
11060,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the upper leather had burst, and was to be sewn together."
11061,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11062,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""That's vulgar work,"" said the Darning-needle. ""I shall never get"
11063,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"through. I'm breaking! I'm breaking!"" And she really broke. ""Did I not"
11064,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"say so?"" said the Darning-needle; ""I'm too fine!"""
11065,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11066,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now it's quite useless,"" said the Fingers; but they were obliged to"
11067,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hold her fast, all the same; for the cook dropped some sealing-wax"
11068,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"upon the needle, and pinned her handkerchief together with it in"

11070,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11071,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""So, now I'm a breast-pin!"" said the Darning-needle. ""I knew very"
11072,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"well that I should come to honor; when one is something, one comes to"
11073,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"something!"""
11074,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11075,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And she laughed quietly to herself--and one can never see when a
11076,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"darning-needle laughs. There she sat, as proud as if she were in a"
11077,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"state coach, and looked all about her."
11078,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11079,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""May I be permitted to ask if you are of gold?"" she inquired of the"
11080,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"pin, her neighbor. ""You have a very pretty appearance and a peculiar"
11081,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"head, but it is only little. You must take pains to grow, for it's not"
11082,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"every one that has sealing-wax dropped upon him."""
11083,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11084,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the Darning-needle drew herself up so proudly that she fell out of
11085,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the handkerchief right into the sink, which the cook was rinsing out."
11086,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11087,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now we're going on a journey,"" said the Darning-needle. ""If I only"
11088,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"don't get lost!"""
11089,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11090,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But she really was lost.
11091,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11092,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I'm too fine for this world,"" she observed, as she lay in the gutter."
11093,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""But I know who I am, and there's always something in that!"""
11094,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11095,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"So the Darning-needle kept her proud behavior, and did not lose her"
11096,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"good humor. And things of many kinds swam over her, chips and straws"
11097,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and pieces of old newspapers.
11098,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11099,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Only look how they sail!"" said the Darning-needle. ""They don't know"
11100,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"what is under them! I'm here, I remain firmly here. See, there goes"
11101,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,a chip thinking of nothing in the world but of himself--of a chip!
11102,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,There's a straw going by now. How he turns! how he twirls about! Don't
11103,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"think only of yourself, you might easily run up against a stone."
11104,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,There swims a bit of newspaper. What's written upon it has long been
11105,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"forgotten, and yet it gives itself airs. I sit quietly and patiently"
11106,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"here. I know who I am, and I shall remain what I am."""
11107,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11108,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,One day something lay close beside her that glittered splendidly; then
11109,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the Darning-needle believed that it was a diamond; but it was a bit
11110,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of broken bottle; and because it shone the Darning-needle spoke to it,"
11111,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,introducing herself as a breastpin.
11112,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11113,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I suppose you are a diamond?"" she observed."
11114,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11115,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Why, yes, something of that kind."""
11116,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11117,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And then each believed the other to be a very valuable thing; and they
11118,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"began speaking about the world, and how very conceited it was."
11119,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11120,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I have been in a lady's box,"" said the Darning-needle, ""and this"
11121,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lady was a cook. She had five fingers on each hand, and I never saw"
11122,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,anything so conceited as those five fingers. And yet they were only
11123,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there that they might take me out of the box and put me back into it."""
11124,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11125,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Were they of good birth?"" asked the Bit of Bottle."
11126,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11127,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""No, indeed,"" replied the Darning-needle: ""but very haughty. There"
11128,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"were five brothers, all of the finger family. They kept very proudly"
11129,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"together though they were of different lengths: the outermost, the"
11130,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thumbling, was short and fat; he walked out in front of the ranks, and"
11131,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"only had one joint in his back, and could only make a single bow; but"
11132,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he said that if he were hacked off a man, that man was useless for"
11133,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"service in war. Dainty-mouth, the second finger, thrust himself into"
11134,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sweet and sour, pointed to sun and moon, and gave the impression when"
11135,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"they wrote. Longman, the third, looked at all the others over his"
11136,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shoulder. Goldborder, the fourth, went about with a golden belt round"
11137,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"his waist; and little Playman did nothing at all, and was proud of it."
11138,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There was nothing but bragging among them, and therefore I went away."""
11139,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11140,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""And now we sit here and glitter!"" said the Bit of Bottle."
11141,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11142,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"At that moment more water came into the gutter, so that it overflowed,"
11143,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and the Bit of Bottle was carried away.
11144,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11145,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""So he is disposed of,"" observed the Darning-needle. ""I remain here."
11146,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"I am too fine. But that's my pride, and my pride is honorable."" And"
11147,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"proudly she sat there, and had many great thoughts. ""I could almost"
11148,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"believe I had been born of a sunbeam, I'm so fine! It really appears"
11149,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,as if the sunbeams were always seeking for me under the water. Ah!
11150,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"I'm so fine that my mother cannot find me. If I had my old eye, which"
11151,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"broke off, I think I should cry; but, no, I should not do that; it's"
11152,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"not genteel to cry."""
11153,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11154,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"One day a couple of street boys lay grubbing in the gutter, where they"
11155,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sometimes found old nails, farthings, and similar treasures. It was"
11156,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dirty work, but they took great delight in it."
11157,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11158,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh!"" cried one, who had pricked himself with the Darning-needle,"
11159,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""there's a fellow for you!"""
11160,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11161,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I'm not a fellow; I'm a young lady!"" said the Darning-needle."
11162,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11163,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But nobody listened to her. The sealing-wax had come off, and she"
11164,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"had turned black; but black makes one look slender, and she thought"
11165,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,herself finer even than before.
11166,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11167,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Here comes an eggshell sailing along!"" said the boys; and they stuck"
11168,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the Darning-needle fast in the eggshell.
11169,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11170,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""White walls, and black myself! that looks well,"" remarked the"
11171,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Darning-needle. ""Now one can see me. I only hope I shall not be"
11172,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"seasick!"" But she was not seasick at all. ""It is good against"
11173,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"seasickness, if one has a steel stomach, and does not forget that one"
11174,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,is a little more than an ordinary person! Now my seasickness is over.
11175,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The finer one is, the more one can bear."""
11176,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11177,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Crack!"" went the eggshell, for a wagon went over her."
11178,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11179,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Good Heavens, how it crushes one!"" said the Darning-needle. ""I'm"
11180,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"getting seasick now--I'm quite sick."""
11181,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11182,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But she was not really sick, though the wagon went over her; she lay"
11183,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there at full length, and there she may lie."

11197,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11198,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""If only I had a little child of my own,"" she said, ""how the walls"

11201,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11202,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And an old witch heard what the woman wished, and said, ""Oh, but that"

11206,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The woman was in a great hurry to go home and plant the barley-corn,"
11207,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"but she did not forget to say ""thank you"" to the old witch. She not"
11208,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"only thanked her, she even stayed to give her six silver pennies."
11209,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11210,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then she hurried away to her home, took a flower-pot and planted her"
11211,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,precious barley-corn.
11212,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11213,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And what do you think happened? Almost before the corn was planted, up"
11214,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,shot a large and beautiful flower. It was still unopened. The petals
11215,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"were folded closely together, but it looked like a tulip. It really"
11216,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was a tulip, a red and yellow one, too."
11217,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11218,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The woman loved flowers. She stooped and kissed the beautiful bud.
11219,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"As her lips touched the petals, they burst open, and oh! wonder of"
11220,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wonders! there, in the very middle of the flower, there sat a little"
11221,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"child. Such a tiny, pretty little maiden she was."
11222,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11223,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,They called her Thumbelina. That was because she was no bigger than
11224,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the woman's thumb.
11225,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11226,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And where do you think she slept? A little walnut shell, lined with"
11227,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"blue, that was her cradle."
11228,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11229,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,When she slept little Thumbelina lay in her cradle on a tiny heap of
11230,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"violets, with the petal of a pale pink rose to cover her."
11231,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11232,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And where do you think she played? A table was her playground. On the
11233,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,table the woman placed a plate of water. Little Thumbelina called that
11234,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,her lake.
11235,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11236,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Round the plate were scented flowers, the blossoms lying on the edge,"
11237,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,while the pale green stalks reached thirstily down to the water.
11238,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11239,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,In the lake floated a large tulip leaf. This was Thumbelina's little
11240,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"boat. Seated there she sailed from side to side of her little lake,"
11241,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,rowing cleverly with two white horse hairs. As she rowed backwards and
11242,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"forwards she sang softly to herself. The woman listening heard, and"
11243,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,thought she had never known so sweet a song.
11244,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11245,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And now such a sad thing happened.
11246,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11247,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"In through the broken window-pane hopped a big toad, oh! such an"
11248,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"ugly big toad. She hopped right on to the table, where Thumbelina lay"
11249,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dreaming in her tiny cradle, under the pale pink rose leaf."
11250,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11251,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"She peeped at her, this ugly old toad."
11252,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11253,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""How beautiful the little maiden is,"" she croaked. ""She will make a"
11254,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lovely bride for my handsome son."" And she lifted the little cradle,"
11255,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"with Thumbelina in it, and hopped out through the broken window-pane,"
11256,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,down into the garden.
11257,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11258,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"At the foot of the garden was a broad stream. Here, under the muddy"
11259,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,banks lived the old toad with her son.
11260,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11261,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"How handsome she thought him! But he was really very ugly. Indeed, he"
11262,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was exactly like his mother.
11263,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11264,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When he saw little Thumbelina in her tiny cradle, he croaked with"

11266,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11267,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Do not make so much noise,"" said his mother, ""or you will wake the"
11268,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,tiny creature. We may lose her if we are not careful. The slightest
11269,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"breeze would waft her far away. She is as light as gossamer."""
11270,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11271,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then the old toad carried Thumbelina out into the middle of the
11272,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"stream. ""She will be safe here,"" she said, as she laid her gently on"
11273,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"one of the leaves of a large water lily, and paddled back to her son."
11274,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11275,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""We will make ready the best rooms under the mud,"" she told him, ""and"
11276,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"then you and the little maiden will be married."""
11277,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11278,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Poor little Thumbelina! She had not seen the ugly big toad yet, nor"
11279,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,her ugly son.
11280,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11281,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When she woke up early in the morning, how she wept! Water all around"
11282,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,her! How could she reach the shore? Poor little Thumbelina!
11283,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11284,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Down under the mud the old toad was very busy, decking the best room"
11285,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,with buttercups and buds of water-lilies to make it gay for her little
11286,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"daughter-in-law, Thumbelina."
11287,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11288,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Now we will go to bring her little bed and place it ready,"" said"
11289,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the old toad, and together she and her son swam out to the leaf where"
11290,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little Thumbelina sat.
11291,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11292,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Here is my handsome son,"" she said, ""he is to be your husband,"" and"
11293,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"she bowed low in the water, for she wished to be very polite to the"
11294,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little maiden.
11295,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11296,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Croak, croak,"" was all the young toad could say, as he looked at his"
11297,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,pretty little bride.
11298,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11299,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then they took away the tiny little bed, and Thumbelina was left all"
11300,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,alone.
11301,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11302,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,How the tears stained her pretty little face! How fast they fell into
11303,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the stream! Even the fish as they swam hither and thither thought,"
11304,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""How it rains to-day,"" as the tiny drops fell thick and fast."
11305,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11306,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,They popped up their heads and saw the forlorn little maiden.
11307,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11308,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""She shall not marry the ugly toad,"" they said, as they looked with"
11309,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eager eyes at the pretty child. ""No, she shall not marry the ugly"
11310,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"toad."""
11311,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11312,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But what could the little fish do to help Thumbelina?
11313,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11314,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Oh! they were such clever little fish!
11315,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11316,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,They found the green stem which held the leaf on which Thumbelina
11317,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sat. They bit it with their little sharp teeth, and they never"
11318,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"stopped biting, till at last they bit the green stem through; and"
11319,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"away, down the stream, floated the leaf, carrying with it little"
11320,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Thumbelina.
11321,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11322,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Free, free!"" she sang, and her voice tinkled as a chime of fairy"
11323,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"bells. ""Free, free!"" she sang merrily as she floated down the stream,"
11324,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"away, far away out of reach of the ugly old toad and her ugly son."
11325,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11326,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And as she floated on, the little wild birds sang round her, and on"
11327,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the banks the little wild harebells bowed to her.
11328,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11329,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Butterflies were flitting here and there in the sunshine. A pretty
11330,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little white one fluttered on to the leaf on which sat Thumbelina. He
11331,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,loved the tiny maiden so well that he settled down beside her.
11332,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11333,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now she was quite happy! Birds around her, flowers near her, and the"
11334,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,water gleaming like gold in the summer sunshine. What besides could
11335,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little Thumbelina wish?
11336,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11337,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,She took off her sash and threw one end of it round the butterfly. The
11338,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"other end she fastened firmly to the leaf. On and on floated the leaf,"
11339,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the little maiden and the butterfly.
11340,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11341,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Suddenly a great cockchafer buzzed along. Alas! he caught sight of
11342,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little Thumbelina. He flew to her, put his claw round her tiny waist"
11343,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and carried her off, up on to a tree."
11344,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11345,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Poor little Thumbelina! How frightened she was! How grieved she was,"
11346,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"too, for had she not lost her little friend the butterfly?"
11347,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11348,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Would he fly away, she wondered, or would her sash hold him fast?"
11349,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11350,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The cockchafer was charmed with the little maiden. He placed her
11351,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,tenderly on the largest leaf he could find. He gathered honey for her
11352,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"from the flowers, and as she sipped it, he sat near and told her how"
11353,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,beautiful she looked.
11354,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11355,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But there were other chafers living in the tree, and when they came to"
11356,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"see little Thumbelina, they said, ""She is not pretty at all."""
11357,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11358,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""She has only two legs,"" said one."
11359,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11360,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""She has no feelers,"" said another."
11361,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11362,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Some said she was too thin, others that she was too fat, and then they"
11363,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"all buzzed and hummed together, ""How ugly she is, how ugly she is!"""
11364,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But all the time little Thumbelina was the prettiest, daintiest little"
11365,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,maiden that ever lived.
11366,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11367,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And now the cockchafer who had flown off with little Thumbelina
11368,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,thought he had been rather foolish to admire her.
11369,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11370,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He looked at her again. ""Pretty? No, after all she was not very"
11371,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"pretty."" He would have nothing to do with her, and away he and all"
11372,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the other chafers flew. Only first they carried little Thumbelina down
11373,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,from the tree and placed her on a daisy. She wept because she was so
11374,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,ugly--so ugly that the chafers could not live with her. But all the
11375,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"time, you know, she was the prettiest little maiden in the world."
11376,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11377,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"She was living all alone in the wood now, but it was summer and she"
11378,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,could not feel sad or lonely while the warm golden sunshine touched
11379,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"her so gently, while the birds sang to her, and the flowers bowed to"
11380,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,her.
11381,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11382,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Yes, little Thumbelina was happy. She ate honey from the flowers,"
11383,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and drank dew out of the golden buttercups and danced and sang the
11384,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,livelong day.
11385,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11386,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But summer passed away and autumn came. The birds began to whisper
11387,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of flying to warmer countries, and the flowers began to fade and hang"
11388,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"their heads, and as autumn passed away, winter came, cold, dreary"
11389,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,winter.
11390,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11391,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Thumbelina shivered with cold. Her little frock was thin and old.
11392,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"She would certainly be frozen to death, she thought, as she wrapped"
11393,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,herself up in a withered leaf.
11394,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11395,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then the snow began to fall, and each snowflake seemed to smother her."
11396,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,She was so very tiny.
11397,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11398,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Close to the wood lay a corn-field. The beautiful golden grain had
11399,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"been carried away long ago, now there was only dry short stubble. But"
11400,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,to little Thumbelina the stubble was like a great forest.
11401,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11402,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,She walked through the hard field. She was shaking with cold. All at
11403,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"once she saw a little door just before her. She looked again--yes, it"
11404,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was a door.
11405,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11406,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The field-mouse had made a little house under the stubble, and lived"
11407,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"so cosily there. She had a big room full of corn, and she had a"
11408,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,kitchen and pantry as well.
11409,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11410,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Perhaps I shall get some food here,"" thought the cold and hungry"
11411,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little maiden, as she stood knocking at the door, just like a tiny"
11412,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"beggar child. She had had nothing to eat for two long days. Oh, she"
11413,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,was very hungry!
11414,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11415,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What a tiny thing you are!"" said the field-mouse, as she opened the"
11416,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"door and saw Thumbelina. ""Come in and dine with me."""
11417,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11418,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"How glad Thumbelina was, and how she enjoyed dining with the"
11419,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,field-mouse.
11420,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11421,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,She behaved so prettily that the old field-mouse told her she might
11422,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"live with her while the cold weather lasted. ""And you shall keep my"
11423,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"room clean and neat, and you shall tell me stories,"" she added."
11424,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11425,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,That is how Thumbelina came to live with the field-mouse and to meet
11426,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Mr. Mole.
11427,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11428,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""We shall have a visitor soon,"" said the field-mouse. ""My neighbor,"
11429,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Mr. Mole, comes to see me every week-day. His house is very large, and"
11430,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he wears a beautiful coat of black velvet. Unfortunately, he is blind."
11431,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"If you tell him your prettiest stories he may marry you."""
11432,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11433,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now the mole was very wise and very clever, but how could little"
11434,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Thumbelina ever care for him? Why, he did not love the sun, nor the"
11435,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"flowers, and he lived in a house underground. No, Thumbelina did not"
11436,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,wish to marry the mole.
11437,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11438,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,However she must sing to him when he came to visit his neighbor the
11439,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"field-mouse. When she had sung ""Ladybird, Ladybird, fly away home,"""
11440,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and ""Boys and girls come out to play,"" the mole was charmed, and"
11441,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,thought he would like to marry the little maiden with the beautiful
11442,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,voice.
11443,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11444,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then he tried to be very agreeable. He invited the field-mouse and
11445,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Thumbelina to walk along the underground passage he had dug between
11446,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,their houses. Mr. Mole was very fond of digging underground.
11447,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11448,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,As it was dark the mole took a piece of tinder-wood in his mouth and
11449,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,led the way. The tinder-wood shone like a torch in the dark passage.
11450,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11451,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"A little bird lay in the passage, a little bird who had not flown away"
11452,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,when the flowers faded and the cold winds blew.
11453,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11454,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It was dead, the mole said."
11455,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11456,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When he reached the bird, the mole stopped and pushed his nose right"
11457,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"up through the ceiling to make a hole, through which the daylight"
11458,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,might shine.
11459,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11460,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There lay the swallow, his wings pressed close to his side His little"
11461,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,head and legs drawn in under his feathers. He had died of cold.
11462,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11463,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Poor little swallow!"" thought Thumbelina. All wild birds were her"
11464,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,friends. Had they not sung to her and fluttered round her all the long
11465,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,glad summer days?
11466,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11467,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But the mole kicked the swallow with his short legs. ""That one will"
11468,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"sing no more,"" he said roughly. ""It must be sad to be born a bird and"
11469,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,to be able only to sing and fly. I am thankful none of my children
11470,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"will be birds,"" and he proudly smoothed down his velvet coat."
11471,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11472,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Yes,"" said the field-mouse; ""what can a bird do but sing? When the"
11473,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"cold weather comes it is useless."""
11474,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11475,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Thumbelina said nothing. Only when the others moved on, she stooped"
11476,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"down and stroked the bird gently with her tiny hand, and kissed its"
11477,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,closed eyes.
11478,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11479,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"That night the little maiden could not sleep. ""I will go to see the"
11480,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"poor swallow again,"" she thought."
11481,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11482,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,She got up out of her tiny bed. She wove a little carpet out of hay.
11483,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Down the long underground passage little Thumbelina walked, carrying"
11484,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the carpet. She reached the bird at last, and spread the carpet gently"
11485,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,round him. She fetched warm cotton and laid it over the bird.
11486,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11487,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Even down on the cold earth he will be warm now,"" thought the gentle"
11488,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little maiden.
11489,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11490,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Farewell,"" she said sadly, ""farewell, little bird! Did you sing to me"
11491,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"through the long summer days, when the leaves were green and the sky"
11492,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was blue? Farewell, little swallow!"" and she stooped to press her tiny"
11493,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,cheeks against the soft feathers.
11494,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11495,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"As she did so, she heard--what could it be? Pit, pat, pit, pat! Could"
11496,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the bird be alive? Little Thumbelina listened still. Yes, it was the"
11497,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,beating of the little bird's heart that she heard. He had not been
11498,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dead after all, only frozen with cold. The little carpet and the"
11499,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,covering the little maid had brought warmed the bird. He would get
11500,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,well now.
11501,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11502,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"What a big bird he seemed to Thumbelina! She was almost afraid now,"
11503,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"for she was so tiny. She was tiny, but she was brave. Drawing the"
11504,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"covering more closely round the poor swallow, she brought her own"
11505,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"little pillow, that the bird's head might rest softly."
11506,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11507,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Thumbelina stole out again the next night. ""Would the swallow look at"
11508,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"her,"" she wondered."
11509,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11510,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Yes, he opened his eyes, and looked at little Thumbelina, who stood"
11511,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,there with a tiny torch of tinder-wood.
11512,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11513,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Thanks, thanks, little Thumbelina,"" he twittered feebly. ""Soon"
11514,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,I shall grow strong and fly out in the bright sunshine once more;
11515,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thanks, thanks, little maiden."""
11516,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11517,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh! but it is too cold, it snows and freezes, for now it is winter,"""
11518,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"said Thumbelina. ""Stay here and be warm, and I will take care of you,"""
11519,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and she brought the swallow water in a leaf.
11520,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11521,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And the little bird told her all his story,--how he had tried to fly"
11522,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"to the warm countries, and how he had torn his wing on a blackthorn"
11523,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,bush and fallen to the ground. But he could not tell her how he had
11524,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,come to the underground passage.
11525,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11526,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"All winter the swallow stayed there, and Thumbelina was often in the"
11527,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"long passage, with her little torch of tinder-wood. But the mole and"
11528,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the field-mouse did not know how Thumbelina tended and cared for the
11529,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,swallow.
11530,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11531,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"At last spring came, and the sun sent its warmth down where the"
11532,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,swallow lay in the underground passage.
11533,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11534,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Little Thumbelina opened the hole which the mole had made in the
11535,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"ceiling, and the sunshine streamed down on the swallow and the little"
11536,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,girl.
11537,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11538,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"How the swallow longed to soar away, up and up, to be lost to sight in"
11539,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the blue, blue sky!"
11540,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11541,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Come with me, little Thumbelina,"" said the swallow, ""come with me to"
11542,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the blue skies and the green woods."""
11543,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11544,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But Thumbelina remembered how kind the field-mouse had been to her
11545,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"when she was cold and hungry, and she would not leave her."
11546,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11547,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Farewell! farewell! then, little maiden,"" twittered the swallow as he"
11548,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"flew out and up, up into the sunshine."
11549,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11550,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Thumbelina loved the swallow dearly. Her eyes were full of tears as
11551,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,she watched the bird disappearing till he was only a tiny speck of
11552,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,black.
11553,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11554,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And now sad days came to little Thumbelina.
11555,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11556,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The golden corn was once more waving in the sunshine above the house
11557,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of the field-mouse, but Thumbelina must not go out lest she lose"
11558,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,herself among the corn.
11559,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11560,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Not go out in the bright sunshine! Oh, poor little Thumbelina!"
11561,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11562,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""You must get your wedding clothes ready this summer,"" said the"
11563,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"field-mouse. ""You must be well provided with linen and worsted. My"
11564,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"neighbor the mole will wish a well-dressed bride."""
11565,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11566,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The mole had said he wished to marry little Thumbelina before the cold
11567,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,winter came again.
11568,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11569,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"So Thumbelina sat at the spinning-wheel through the long summer days,"
11570,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,spinning and weaving with four little spiders to help her.
11571,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11572,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"In the evening the mole came to visit her. ""Summer will soon be over,"""
11573,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he said, ""and we shall be married."""
11574,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11575,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But oh! little Thumbelina did not wish the summer to end.
11576,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11577,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Live with the dull old mole, who hated the sunshine, who would not"
11578,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,listen to the song of the birds--live underground with him! Little
11579,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Thumbelina wished the summer would never end.
11580,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11581,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The spinning and weaving were over now. All the wedding clothes were
11582,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,ready. Autumn was come.
11583,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11584,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Only four weeks and the wedding-day will have come,"" said the"
11585,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,field-mouse.
11586,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11587,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And little Thumbelina wept.
11588,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11589,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I will not marry the tiresome old mole,"" she said."
11590,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11591,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I shall bite you with my white tooth if you talk such nonsense,"" said"
11592,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the field-mouse. ""Among all my friends not one of them has such a fine"
11593,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,velvet coat as the mole. His cellars are full and his rooms are large.
11594,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"You ought to be glad to marry so well,"" she ended."
11595,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11596,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Was there no escape from the underground home?"" little Thumbelina"
11597,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,wondered.
11598,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11599,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The wedding-day came. The mole arrived to fetch his little bride.
11600,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11601,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,How could she say good-by for ever to the beautiful sunshine?
11602,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11603,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Farewell, farewell!"" she cried, and waved her little hands towards"
11604,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the glorious sun.
11605,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11606,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Farewell, farewell!"" she cried, and threw her tiny arms round a"
11607,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,little red flower growing at her feet.
11608,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11609,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Tell the dear swallow, when he comes again,"" she whispered to the"
11610,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"flower, ""tell him I will never forget him."""
11611,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11612,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Tweet, tweet!"" what was that Thumbelina heard? ""Tweet, tweet!"" Could"
11613,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,it be the swallow?
11614,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11615,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The flutter of wings was round her. Little Thumbelina looked. How glad
11616,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"she was, for there, indeed, was the little bird she had tended and"
11617,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"cared for so long. She told him, weeping, she must not stay. She"
11618,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"must marry the mole and live underground, and never see the sun, the"
11619,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,glorious sun.
11620,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11621,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Come with me, come with me, little Thumbelina,"" twittered the"
11622,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"swallow. ""You can sit on my back, and I will fly with you to warmer"
11623,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"countries, far from the tiresome old mole. Over mountains and seas we"
11624,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"will fly to the country where the summer never ends, and the sunlight"
11625,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"always shines."""
11626,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11627,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then little Thumbelina seated herself on her dear swallow's back, and"
11628,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,put her tiny feet on his outstretched wing. She tied herself firmly
11629,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,with her little sash to the strongest feather of the bird.
11630,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11631,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And the swallow soared high into the air. High above forests and
11632,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lakes, high above the big mountains that were crested with snow, he"
11633,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,soared.
11634,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11635,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And little Thumbelina shivered as she felt the cold air, but soon she"
11636,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"crept under the bird's warm feathers, and only pushed out her little"
11637,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,head to see the beauty all around her.
11638,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11639,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,They had reached the warm countries now. The sun was more brilliant
11640,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"here, the flowers more radiant."
11641,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11642,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"On and on flew the swallow, till he came to a white marble palace."
11643,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Half-ruined it was, and vine leaves trailed up the long slender"
11644,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"pillars. And among the broad, green leaves many a swallow had built"
11645,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"his nest, and one of these nests belonged to Thumbelina's little"
11646,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,swallow.
11647,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11648,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""This is my home,"" said the bird, ""but you shall live in one of"
11649,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"these brilliant flowers, in the loveliest of them all'."""
11650,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11651,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And little Thumbelina clapped her hands with joy.
11652,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11653,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The swallow flew with her to a stately sunflower, and set her"
11654,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,carefully on one of the broad yellow petals.
11655,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11656,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But think, what was her surprise! In the very heart of the flower"
11657,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"stood a little Prince, fair and transparent as crystal. On his head he"
11658,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wore a crown of gold, on his shoulders a pair of delicate wings, and"
11659,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"he was small, every bit as small as Thumbelina. He was the spirit of"
11660,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the flower.
11661,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11662,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"For you know in each flower there is a spirit, a tiny little boy or"
11663,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"girl, but this little Prince was King of all the flower spirits."
11664,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11665,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The little King thought Thumbelina the loveliest maiden he had ever
11666,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,seen. He took off his golden crown and placed it on the tiny head
11667,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of the little maid, and in a silvery voice he asked, ""Will you be my"
11668,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"bride, little Thumbelina, and reign with me over the flower spirits?"""
11669,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11670,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,How glad Thumbelina was!
11671,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11672,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The little King wished to marry her. Yes, she would be his little"
11673,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Queen.
11674,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11675,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then out of each blossom stepped tiny little children. They came to
11676,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,pay their homage to little Thumbelina.
11677,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11678,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Each one brought her a present, and the most beautiful of all the"

11681,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,flower to flower.
11682,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11683,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And the swallow sat on his nest above, and sang his sweetest bridal"

11695,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11696,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"A story about a tinder-box? Yes, but then it was such a wonderful one!"
11697,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Why, it must certainly have been a magic box!"
11698,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11699,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It belonged to an old witch, this tinder-box, but it had been left"
11700,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,right down inside a tree by the ugly old witch's grandmother. But get
11701,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"it again she must, for she knew it really was a magic tinder-box."
11702,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11703,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But how could she get it?
11704,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11705,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Ah! here was her chance.
11706,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11707,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Tramp, tramp; right, left, right, left. She heard the steps come"
11708,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,nearer and nearer. She looked! There was a soldier coming along;
11709,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tramp, tramp."
11710,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11711,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"She could see him now, with a knapsack on his back, and his sword at"
11712,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,his side.
11713,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11714,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The soldier had been to the wars and was coming home.
11715,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11716,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Good evening,"" said the witch, as he came close to her. ""Good"
11717,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"evening; what a bright sword you wear, and what a big knapsack! You"
11718,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shall have as much money as you wish for yourself!"""
11719,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11720,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Thank you, old witch,"" said the soldier. But he did not tell her that"
11721,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,she did not look as though she had much money to spare. He was too
11722,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wise to say anything but, ""Thank you, old witch."""
11723,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11724,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Do you see that big tree?"" she said, and she pointed to one that"
11725,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"stood close by the wayside. ""It is hollow inside. Climb up to the top,"
11726,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and you will see a hole. It is large. You must creep through it and
11727,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"let yourself down, right down under the tree. Tie a rope round your"
11728,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"waist, and I will haul you up again when you call."""
11729,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11730,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""But what am I to do under the tree?"" asked the soldier."
11731,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11732,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What are you to do? Why, did I not tell you you should have money."
11733,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It is there, under the tree, copper, silver, gold. Gold!"" cried the"
11734,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"witch, in a rough and eager voice. ""When you come to the bottom of the"
11735,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tree there is a large passage. It is quite light, indeed it is ablaze"
11736,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,with light. More than a hundred lamps are burning. There you will see
11737,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,three doors. The keys are in the keyholes. Unlock the doors and walk
11738,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"in. In the first room in the middle of the floor, is a big box. On the"
11739,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"top of it sits a dog. He has big eyes, they are as big as saucers,"
11740,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,but do not let that trouble you. You shall have my blue checked apron.
11741,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Spread it on the floor. Go forward quickly, seize the dog and place"
11742,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"him on it. After that is done, you can open the box, and take out as"
11743,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"much money as you wish. It is true the box holds only copper coins,"
11744,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"but if you would rather have silver, just walk into the next room."
11745,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There sits another dog, on another box, with big eyes, eyes as big"
11746,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"as--oh, as big as mill-wheels, but never mind that. Place the dog on"
11747,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"my apron, then open the box and take as much silver as you wish. But"
11748,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"if you would rather have gold, why, then open the third door."
11749,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"There you will see another dog, sitting on another box. This one is"
11750,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tremendous, quite gigantic, and he has eyes, oh! such great, rolling"
11751,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eyes! They are as large as the Round Tower. He is a dog indeed, but"
11752,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,do not let that trouble you. Place him on my blue checked apron and he
11753,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"will not hurt you. Then take gold, as much gold as ever you wish."""
11754,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11755,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Splendid!"" said the soldier. You see he had been to the wars and was"
11756,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"a brave man. ""Splendid! But what am I to give you, old witch? You will"
11757,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wish something, I am quite certain of that."""
11758,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11759,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""No,"" said the witch: ""I do not wish one single coin. But I do wish my"
11760,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"old tinder-box. My grandmother left it behind her, the last time she"
11761,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"went down the tree."""
11762,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11763,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Well, tie the rope round my waist,"" said the soldier."
11764,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11765,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Here it is,"" said the witch, ""and here is my blue checked apron. It"
11766,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"is very important."""
11767,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11768,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Up the tree climbed the soldier, into the tree he crept through the"
11769,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hole at the top, and down, down the hollow inside he slipped, and"
11770,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there he was, in a wide passage, lighted, as the witch had said, by a"
11771,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,hundred burning lamps.
11772,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11773,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The soldier unlocked the first door he saw. There sat the dog with
11774,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eyes as big as saucers, staring at him in great surprise."
11775,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11776,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I must obey my orders,"" thought the soldier."
11777,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11778,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He placed the witch's apron on the floor, seized the dog bravely, and"
11779,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,placed him on the apron.
11780,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11781,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then he opened the box. It was full of copper coins. He crammed as
11782,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"many as he could into his pocket, shut the lid, placed the dog again"
11783,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"on the box, and passed on to the second door."
11784,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11785,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He unlocked it. Yes! there sat another dog on another box, with great"
11786,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eyes, as big as mill-wheels."
11787,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11788,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""If you stare at me so hard, you will hurt your eyes,"" said the"
11789,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"soldier, and thought what a joke he had made. Then he seized the dog,"
11790,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"placed it on the witch's apron, and raised the lid of the second box."
11791,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11792,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Silver, every coin was silver! The soldier threw away all his copper"
11793,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,coins in a great hurry. He must have silver. He stuffed his pockets
11794,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and his knapsack with the silver coins, and clapped his hands. He was"
11795,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,rich now.
11796,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11797,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,On he went to the third room. He unlocked it. There indeed was another
11798,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"box and another dog, and oh, horrible! the soldier almost shut his"
11799,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eyes. The dog had eyes, great big rolling eyes, eyes as large as the"
11800,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Round Tower. And they would not keep still. No, round and round they"
11801,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,rolled.
11802,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11803,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But the soldier was brave; he had been to the wars.
11804,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11805,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Good evening,"" he said, and he lifted his hat respectfully, for never"
11806,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"before in all his life, had he seen so big, so enormous a creature."
11807,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11808,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then he walked straight up to the dog. Could he lift him? Yes, he"
11809,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"took the immense animal in his arms, set him on the witch's apron, and"
11810,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,opened the third box.
11811,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11812,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Gold! It was full of gold. He would be able to buy the whole town,"
11813,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and all the sugar-plums, and all the tin soldiers, and all the"
11814,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,rocking-horses and whips in the world.
11815,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11816,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The soldier was delighted. He threw away his silver money. Silver! He
11817,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"did not want silver. Here was gold, gold!"
11818,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11819,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He filled his pockets and his knapsack, but he could not bear to stop"
11820,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there. No, he crammed his cap and his boots so full that he could"
11821,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hardly walk. He was really rich at last. He shut the lid, placed the"
11822,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dog again on the box, and went out of the room, along the passage."
11823,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11824,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then he shouted up the tree, ""Halloo, old witch! haul me up again."""
11825,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11826,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Have you got the tinder-box?"" said the witch."
11827,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11828,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Oh, that I had quite forgotten,"" answered the soldier, and back he"
11829,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,went to fetch it.
11830,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11831,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"When he came back the witch took the rope and hauled and hauled, till"
11832,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there was the soldier, once more, safe on the high road, just as he"
11833,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"was before, only now he was rich, so rich that he had become very"
11834,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,bold.
11835,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11836,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He had gold in his pockets, gold in his knapsack, gold in his cap,"
11837,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,gold in his boots.
11838,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11839,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What are you going to do with the tinder-box, just tell me that?"""
11840,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,said the soldier.
11841,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11842,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""That is no business of yours,"" said the witch. ""You have the gold,"
11843,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"give me the tinder-box!"""
11844,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11845,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Rubbish!"" said the soldier. He had grown rude as well as rich, you"
11846,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"see. ""Rubbish--take your choice--tell me at once what you mean to do"
11847,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"with the tinker-box, or I will draw my sword and cut off your head."""
11848,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11849,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I won't tell you,"" screamed the witch."
11850,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11851,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then the soldier cut off her head, and the poor witch lay there dead."
11852,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But the soldier did not stay to look at her. In a great hurry he took
11853,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,all his gold and tied it up in the blue checked apron.
11854,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11855,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He slung it across his shoulder, put the tinder-box in his pocket, and"
11856,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,marched off to town.
11857,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11858,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,How grand he felt! What heaps of gold he had in his bundle!
11859,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11860,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,When the soldier reached the town he walked straight to the finest
11861,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hotel, and asked for the best rooms, and for dinner ordered all his"
11862,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,favorite puddings and fruits.
11863,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11864,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The servant who cleaned his boots tossed her head. ""Shabby boots for a"
11865,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"rich man to wear,"" she said."
11866,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11867,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"But next day the soldier had bought himself very grand new boots, and"
11868,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"gay clothing, so that no one could possibly call him shabby."
11869,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11870,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Shabby! No, he was a great man now, and people crowded round this rich"
11871,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fellow, told him all the sights there were to be seen in their city,"
11872,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"all about their King too, and the beautiful Princess, his daughter."
11873,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11874,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I should like to see her, this wonderful Princess,"" said the soldier."
11875,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11876,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""But you cannot see her,"" they told him. ""She lives, the beautiful"
11877,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess, in a great copper castle, with walls and towers all round."
11878,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Only the King visits her there, for it was once foretold that she"
11879,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"would marry a common soldier, and that our King does not wish."""
11880,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11881,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I must see her once, just once,"" thought the soldier. But how was he"
11882,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"going to find the way into the castle, that was the question?"
11883,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11884,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Meanwhile he led a merry life. He drove about in the King's Park; he
11885,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"went to the theater; he gave money to the poor, because he remembered"
11886,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,how miserable it was to have no money in his own pocket.
11887,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11888,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The soldier was always gaily dressed now. He had a great many friends
11889,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"who said he was a real gentleman, and that pleased him very much."
11890,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11891,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And so he went on day after day, spending money and giving money, but"
11892,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"getting none, till at last the gold came to an end. He had only two"
11893,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,copper coins left: he was only a poor soldier once more.
11894,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11895,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Leaving the grand hotel he went to live in a small room. He found a
11896,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tiny attic, just under a roof, up, oh! so many stairs. Here he lived,"
11897,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"mending his own clothes, brushing his own boots. He had no visitors,"
11898,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,for his grand friends would not take the trouble to walk up so many
11899,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,stairs to his little attic.
11900,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11901,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Hungry? Yes, he was hungry too, and as he had no money to buy even a"
11902,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"farthing candle, he had to sit alone in the dark."
11903,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11904,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,One evening he suddenly thought of the witch's tinder-box. Surely in
11905,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,it there were matches.
11906,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11907,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The soldier opened it eagerly. Yes, there lay the matches. He seized"
11908,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,one and struck it on the tinder-box.
11909,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11910,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"No sooner had he done this, than the door burst suddenly open, and"
11911,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"there, there, staring at him, stood the dog with eyes as big as"
11912,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,saucers.
11913,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11914,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What does my master command?"" asked the dog."
11915,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11916,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""No wonder the old witch wished the tinder-box for her very own,"""
11917,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thought the soldier. Aloud he said to the dog, ""Fetch me some money,"""
11918,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,and the dog instantly vanished to do his master's bidding.
11919,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11920,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He was back in a moment, and lo! in his mouth was a big bag, full of"
11921,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,pennies.
11922,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11923,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Why, this is a magic box,"" said the soldier. ""I have a treasure"
11924,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"indeed."" And so he had, for listen! Strike the box once, the dog with"
11925,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,eyes as large as saucers appeared. Strike it twice and the dog with
11926,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,eyes as big as mill-wheels appeared. Strike it thrice and there
11927,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,appeared the monster dog with eyes that rolled round and round and
11928,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,were as large as the Round Tower itself. All three dogs did the
11929,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,soldier's bidding.
11930,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11931,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Now the soldier could have gold again. Gold as much as ever he wished.
11932,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11933,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,He moved once more to the grand rooms in the fine hotel. He had gay
11934,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"clothes again; and now, strangely enough, all his friends came to see"
11935,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,him and liked him as much as ever.
11936,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11937,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,One evening the soldier's thoughts wandered away to the beautiful
11938,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess, the beautiful Princess who was shut up so safely in the"
11939,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,great copper palace.
11940,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11941,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""It is ridiculous that no one sees the Princess,"" thought the soldier."
11942,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I want to see her, and I shall."""
11943,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11944,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He pulled out his tinder-box, struck a light, and lo! there stood the"
11945,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,dog with eyes as large as saucers.
11946,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11947,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""It is the middle of the night,"" said the soldier, ""but I must see the"
11948,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess, if it is only for a moment."""
11949,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11950,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The dog bounded out of the door, and before the soldier had time"
11951,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,to wonder what he would do or say if the beautiful Princess really
11952,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"appeared, there she was."
11953,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11954,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Yes, there she was, fast asleep on the dog's back. She was beautiful,"
11955,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,so beautiful that the soldier was quite sure that she was a real
11956,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Princess. He stooped and kissed her hand. She was so beautiful he
11957,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"could not help it. Then off ran the dog, back to the copper palace"
11958,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,with the Princess.
11959,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11960,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I had such a strange dream last night,"" the Princess told the King"
11961,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"and Queen at breakfast next morning. ""I dreamed that an enormous dog"
11962,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"came and carried me off to a soldier, and the soldier kissed my hand."
11963,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"It was a strange dream,"" she murmured."
11964,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11965,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""The Princess must not be left alone to-night,"" said the Queen. ""She"
11966,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"may be frightened if she dreams again."" And she told an old dame who"
11967,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,lived at court to sit in the Princess's room at night.
11968,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11969,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But what would the Queen have said if she had known that what the
11970,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Princess told them was no dream, but something that had really and"
11971,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,truly happened?
11972,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11973,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Well, that evening the soldier thought he would like to see the"
11974,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Princess again.
11975,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11976,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He struck a light, and there stood one of his obedient dogs."
11977,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11978,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Bring the Princess,"" ordered the soldier, and the dog vanished to do"
11979,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,his master's will.
11980,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11981,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The old dame sat beside the Princess's bed. She had heard all about
11982,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the Princess's dream.
11983,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11984,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Was she dreaming herself now?"" she wondered. She pinched"
11985,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"herself.--No, she was wide awake, yet she saw a dog, a real dog with"
11986,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"eyes as large as saucers, in front of her."
11987,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11988,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The dog seized the Princess, and ran off; but although he ran very"
11989,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"quickly, the old dame found time to put on her goloshes before she"
11990,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,followed.
11991,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11992,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"How she panted along! How she ran, the faithful old dame! She was just"
11993,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,in time to see the Princess on the dog's back disappear into a large
11994,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,house.
11995,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
11996,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""I shall mark the house, so that I may know it in the morning,"" she"
11997,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,thought. And she took a piece of white chalk and made a great white
11998,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,cross on the door.
11999,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12000,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then she walked home and slept.
12001,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12002,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Soon afterwards the dog carried the Princess back to the copper
12003,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"palace, and noticed the great white cross on the door of the hotel"
12004,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,where his master lived.
12005,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12006,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"And what do you think he did? Oh, he was a wise dog. He took a piece"
12007,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"of chalk, and he put a great white cross on every door in the town."
12008,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12009,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Early next morning the King and Queen and all the lords and ladies of
12010,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the court were astir. They had heard the old dame's story, and were"
12011,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,going to see the house with the great white cross.
12012,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12013,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"They had scarcely started, when the King's eyes fell on a great white"
12014,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"cross! ""Here it is,"" cried the King eagerly."
12015,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12016,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""What nonsense you talk, my dear! it is here,"" said the Queen, for"
12017,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,almost at the same moment she too had seen a door with a great white
12018,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,cross.
12019,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12020,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then all the lords and ladies cried: ""It is here, it is here,"" as"
12021,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,one after another they saw doors marked with great white crosses. The
12022,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hubbub was terrible, and the poor old dame was quite bewildered. How"
12023,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,could she tell which door she had marked? It was quite useless. The
12024,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"dog had perplexed everybody, and they went back to the copper palace"
12025,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,knowing no more than when they left it.
12026,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12027,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,But the Queen was a clever woman. She could do more than just sit very
12028,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,properly on a throne.
12029,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12030,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The same evening, she took her big gold scissors and cut up a large"
12031,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,piece of silk into small pieces. These she sewed together into a
12032,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,pretty little bag. Then she filled the bag with the finest grains of
12033,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"wheat. With her own hands she tied the bag round the Princess's waist,"
12034,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,after which she took her gold scissors again and cut a tiny little
12035,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"hole in the bag, a hole just big enough to let the grains of wheat"
12036,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,drop out whenever the Princess moved.
12037,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12038,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,That night the dog came again and carried the Princess off to the
12039,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"soldier, and the soldier wished he were a Prince, for then he would"
12040,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,marry this beautiful Princess.
12041,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12042,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Now although the dog had very big eyes, eyes as large as saucers, he"
12043,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,did not notice the tiny grains of wheat as they dropped out all along
12044,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the road from the palace to the soldier's window. Under the window
12045,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the dog stopped and climbed up the wall with the Princess, into the"
12046,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,soldier's room.
12047,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12048,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,The next morning the King and Queen followed the little grains of
12049,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,wheat and very easily found out where the Princess had been.
12050,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12051,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Then the soldier was seized and put into prison.
12052,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12053,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Oh, how dark and tiresome it was! But it was worse than that one day,"
12054,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"when they told him he was to be hanged, ""hanged to-morrow,"" they told"
12055,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,him.
12056,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12057,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"What a fright the soldier was in, and, worst of all, he had left his"
12058,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,tinder-box at the hotel.
12059,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12060,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,Morning came! Through the narrow bars of his little window the soldier
12061,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,could see the people all hurrying out of town. They were going to see
12062,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,him hanged.
12063,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12064,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He heard the drums, he saw the soldiers marching along. He wished he"
12065,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"were marching with them. Alas, alas! that could never be now--"
12066,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12067,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"A little shoemaker's apprentice, with a leather apron, came running"
12068,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,along. He was in such a hurry that he lost one of his slippers. It
12069,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"fell close under the soldier's window, as he sat peering out through"
12070,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the narrow bars.
12071,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12072,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The soldier called to the boy, ""There is no hurry, for I am still"
12073,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,here. Nothing will happen till I go. I will give you two-pence if you
12074,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,will run to the house where I used to live and fetch me my tinder-box.
12075,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"You must run all the way."""
12076,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12077,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The shoemaker's boy thought he would like to earn twopence, and off he"
12078,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,raced to bring the tinder-box.
12079,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12080,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He found it. ""A useless little box,"" he said to himself, but back he"
12081,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,raced with it to the soldier; and then--what do you think happened?
12082,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12083,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Outside the town the scaffold had been raised, the soldiers were drawn"
12084,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"up round it, as well as crowds of people."
12085,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12086,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The King and Queen were there too, seated on a magnificent throne,"
12087,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,exactly opposite the judges and councilors.
12088,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12089,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The rope was being put round the soldier's neck, when he turned to"
12090,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,the King and Queen and earnestly entreated one last favor--only to be
12091,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,allowed to smoke one pipe of tobacco.
12092,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12093,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,What a harmless request! How could the King refuse so harmless a
12094,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,request?
12095,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12096,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Yes,"" said his Majesty, ""you may smoke one pipe of tobacco."""
12097,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12098,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The soldier took out his tinder-box, struck a match, once, twice,"
12099,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"thrice, and lo! there before him stood the three enormous dogs,"
12100,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,waiting his commands.
12101,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12102,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"""Help me,"" shouted the soldier; ""do not let me be hanged."""
12103,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12104,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"At once the three terrible dogs rushed at the judges and councilors,"
12105,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"tossed them high into the air, so that as they fell they were broken"
12106,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,into pieces.
12107,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12108,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"The King began to speak; perhaps he was going to forgive the soldier,"
12109,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"but no one knows what he was going to say, for the biggest dog gave"
12110,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,him no time to finish his sentence.
12111,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12112,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"He rushed at the King and Queen, flung them high into the air, so that"
12113,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"when they fell down, they too were broken all to pieces."
12114,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12115,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then the soldiers and the people, who were all terribly frightened,"
12116,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"shouted in a great hurry, ""Brave soldier, you shall be our King, and"
12117,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the beautiful Princess shall be our Queen!"""
12118,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12119,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,And while they led the soldier to the royal carriage the great big
12120,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,dogs bounded along in front.
12121,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12122,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Little boys whistled gaily, and the guards presented arms."
12123,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,
12124,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"Then the Princess was sent for, and made Queen, which she liked much"
12125,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,better than living shut up in a copper palace. And the wedding feast
12126,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"lasted for eight whole days, and the three monster wizard dogs sat at"
12127,BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN,"the table, staring around them with all their eyes."

12138,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12139,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12140,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Once on a time there was a man who had three sons, Peter, Paul, and"
12141,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"John. John was Boots, of course, because he was the youngest. I can't"
12142,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"say the man had anything more than these three sons, for he had n't"
12143,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,one penny to rub against another; and so he told his sons over and
12144,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,over again they must go out into the world and try to earn their
12145,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"bread, for there at home there was nothing to be looked for but"
12146,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,starving to death.
12147,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12148,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Now, near the man's cottage was the King's palace, and, you must know,"
12149,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"just against the King's windows a great oak had sprung up, which"
12150,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,was so stout and big that it took away all the light from the King's
12151,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"palace. The King had said he would give many, many dollars to the man"
12152,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"who could fell the oak, but no one was man enough for that, for as"
12153,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"soon as ever one chip of the oak's trunk flew off, two grew in its"
12154,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"stead. A well, too, the King would have dug, which was to hold water"
12155,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"for the whole year; for all his neighbors had wells, but he hadn't"
12156,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"any, and that he thought a shame. So the King said he would give to"
12157,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,any one who could dig him such a well as would hold water for a whole
12158,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"year round, both money and goods; but no one could do it, for the"
12159,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"King's palace lay high, high up on a hill, and they had dug only a few"
12160,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,inches before they came upon the living rock.
12161,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12162,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"But as the King had set his heart on having these two things done,"
12163,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"he had it given out far and wide, in all the churches of his kingdom,"
12164,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"that he who could fell the big oak in the King's courtyard, and get"
12165,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"him a well that would hold water the whole year round, should have"
12166,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the Princess and half the kingdom. Well, you may easily know there"
12167,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,was many a man who came to try his luck; but for all their hacking and
12168,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"hewing, and all their digging and delving, it was no good. The oak got"
12169,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"bigger and stouter at every stroke, and the rock didn't get softer,"
12170,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,either. So one day those three brothers thought they'd set off and
12171,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"try too, and their father hadn't a word against it; for even if they"
12172,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"didn't get the Princess and half the kingdom, it might happen they"
12173,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,might get a place somewhere with a good master; and that was all he
12174,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"wanted. So when the brothers said they thought of going to the palace,"
12175,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"their father said ""yes"" at once. So Peter, Paul, and Jack went off"
12176,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,from their home.
12177,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12178,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Well, they hadn't gone far before they came to a fir-wood, and up"
12179,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"along one side of it rose a steep hillside, and as they went, they"
12180,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,heard something hewing and hacking away up on the hill among the
12181,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,trees.
12182,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12183,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I wonder, now, what it is that is hewing away up yonder,"" said Jack."
12184,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12185,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""You're always so clever with your wonderings,"" said Peter and Paul"
12186,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"both at once. ""What wonder is it, pray, that a woodcutter should stand"
12187,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and hack up on a hillside?"""
12188,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12189,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Still, I'd like to see what it is, after all,"" said Jack; and up he"
12190,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,went.
12191,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12192,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Oh, if you're such a child, 'twill do you good to go and take a"
12193,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"lesson,"" bawled out his brothers after him."
12194,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12195,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,But Jack didn't care for what they said; he climbed the steep hillside
12196,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"towards where the noise came, and when he reached the place, what do"
12197,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"you think he saw? Why, an axe that stood there hacking and hewing, all"
12198,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"of itself, at the trunk of a fir."
12199,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12200,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good-day!"" said Jack. ""So you stand here all alone and hew, do you?"""
12201,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12202,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Yes; here I've stood and hewed and hacked a long, long time, waiting"
12203,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"for you,"" said the Axe."
12204,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12205,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, here I am at last,"" said Jack, as he took the axe, pulled it"
12206,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"off its handle, and stuffed both head and handle into his wallet."
12207,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12208,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So when he got down again to his brothers, they began to jeer and"
12209,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,laugh at him.
12210,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12211,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""And now, what funny thing was it you saw up yonder on the hillside?"""
12212,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,they said.
12213,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12214,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Oh, it was only an axe we heard,"" said Jack."
12215,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12216,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So when they had gone a bit farther, they came under a steep spur of"
12217,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"rock, and up there they heard something digging and shoveling."
12218,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12219,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I wonder now,"" said Jack, ""what it is digging and shoveling up yonder"
12220,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"at the top of the rock."""
12221,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12222,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Ah, you're always so clever with your wonderings,"" said Peter and"
12223,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Paul again; ""as if you'd never heard a woodpecker hacking and pecking"
12224,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"at a hollow tree."""
12225,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12226,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, well,"" said Jack, ""I think it would be a piece of fun just to"
12227,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"see what it really is."""
12228,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12229,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"And so off he set to climb the rock, while the others laughed and made"
12230,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"game of him. But he didn't care a bit for that; up he climbed, and"
12231,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"when he got near the top, what do you think he saw? Why, a spade that"
12232,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,stood there digging and delving.
12233,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12234,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good-day!"" said Jack. ""So you stand here all alone, and dig and"
12235,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"delve!"""
12236,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12237,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Yes, that's what I do,"" said the Spade, ""and that's what I've done"
12238,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"this many a long day, waiting for you."""
12239,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12240,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, here I am,"" said Jack again, as he took the spade and knocked"
12241,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"it off its handle, and put it into his wallet, and then down again to"
12242,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,his brothers.
12243,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12244,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, what was it, so rare and strange,"" said Peter and Paul, ""that"
12245,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"you saw up there at the top of the rock?"""
12246,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12247,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Oh,"" said Jack, ""nothing more than a spade; that was what we heard."""
12248,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12249,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So they went on again a good bit, till they came to a brook. They were"
12250,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"thirsty, all three, after their long walk, and so they lay down beside"
12251,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,the brook to have a drink.
12252,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12253,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I wonder now,"" said Jack, ""where all this water comes from."""
12254,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12255,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I wonder if you're right in your head,"" said Peter and Paul in one"
12256,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"breath. ""If you're not mad already, you'll go mad very soon, with your"
12257,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"wonderings. Where the brook comes from, indeed! Have you never heard"
12258,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"how water rises from a spring in the earth?"""
12259,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12260,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Yes; but still I've a great fancy to see where this brook comes"
12261,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"from,"" said Jack."
12262,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12263,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So up alongside the brook he went, in spite of all that his brothers"
12264,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"bawled after him. Nothing could stop him. On he went. So, as he went"
12265,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"up and up, the brook got smaller and smaller, and at last, a little"
12266,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"way farther on, what do you think he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out"
12267,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,of that the water trickled.
12268,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12269,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good-day!"" said Jack again; ""So you lie here, and trickle and run"
12270,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"down all alone?"""
12271,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12272,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Yes, I do,"" said the Walnut; ""and here have I trickled and run this"
12273,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"many a long day, waiting for you."""
12274,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12275,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, here I am,"" said Jack, as he took up a lump of moss, and"
12276,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"plugged up the hole, that the water mightn't run out. Then he put the"
12277,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"walnut into his wallet, and ran down to his brothers."
12278,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12279,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, now,"" said Peter and Paul, ""have you found out where the water"
12280,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"comes from? A rare sight it must have been!"""
12281,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12282,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Oh, after all, it was only a hole it ran out of,"" said Jack; and so"
12283,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the others laughed and made game of him again, but Jack didn't mind"
12284,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,that a bit.
12285,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12286,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""After all, I had the fun of seeing it,"" said he."
12287,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12288,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,So when they had gone a bit farther they came to the King's palace;
12289,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,but as every one in the kingdom had heard how they might win the
12290,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Princess and half the realm, if they could only fell the big oak and"
12291,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"dig the King's well, so many had come to try their luck that the oak"
12292,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"was now twice as stout and big as it had been at first, for two chips"
12293,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"grew for every one they hewed out with their axes, as I dare say you"
12294,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,all bear in mind. So the King had now laid it down as a punishment
12295,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"that if any one tried and couldn't fell the oak, he should be put on"
12296,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"a barren island, and both his ears were to be clipped off. But the two"
12297,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,brothers didn't let themselves be scared by that; they were quite sure
12298,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"they could fell the oak, and Peter, as he was eldest, was to try his"
12299,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,hand first; but it went with him as with all the rest who had hewn
12300,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"at the oak; for every chip he cut out, two grew in its place. So the"
12301,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"King's men seized him, and clipped off both his ears, and put him out"
12302,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,on the island.
12303,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12304,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Now Paul, he was to try his luck, but he fared just the same; when he"
12305,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"had hewn two or three strokes, they began to see the oak grow, and so"
12306,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the King's men seized him too, and clipped his ears, and put him out"
12307,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"on the island; and his ears they clipped closer, because they said he"
12308,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,ought to have taken a lesson from his brother.
12309,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12310,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,So now Jack was to try.
12311,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12312,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""If you _will_ look like a marked sheep, we're quite ready to clip"
12313,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"your ears at once, and then you'll save yourself some bother,"" said"
12314,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the King, for he was angry with him for his brothers' sake."
12315,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12316,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, I'd like to just try first,"" said Jack, and so he got leave."
12317,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,Then he took his axe out of his wallet and fitted it to its handle.
12318,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12319,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Hew away!"" said he to his axe; and away it hewed, making the chips"
12320,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"fly again, so that it wasn't long before down came the oak."
12321,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12322,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"When that was done, Jack pulled out his spade, and fitted it to its"
12323,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,handle.
12324,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12325,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Dig away!"" said he to the spade; and so the spade began to dig and"
12326,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"delve till the earth and rock flew out in splinters, and so he had the"
12327,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"well soon dug out, you may think."
12328,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12329,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"And when he had got it as big and deep as he chose, Jack took out his"
12330,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"walnut and laid it in one corner of the well, and pulled the plug of"
12331,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,moss out.
12332,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12333,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Trickle and run,"" said Jack, and so the nut trickled and ran, till"
12334,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the water gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a short time the"
12335,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,well was brimful.
12336,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12337,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Then Jack had felled the oak which shaded the King's palace, and dug"
12338,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"a well in the palace-yard, and so he got the Princess and half the"
12339,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"kingdom, as the King had said; but it was lucky for Peter and Paul"
12340,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"that they had lost their ears, else they had heard each hour and day"

12350,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12351,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12352,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,Once on a time there was a man so surly and cross he never thought
12353,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"his wife did anything right in the house. So one evening, in haymaking"
12354,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and"
12355,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,making a dust.
12356,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12357,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man,"" said his goody;"
12358,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out with the mowers and mow,"
12359,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and you shall mind the house at home."""
12360,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12361,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Yes, the husband thought that would do very well. He was quite"
12362,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"willing, he said."
12363,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12364,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and"
12365,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,went out into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow; but the
12366,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"man was to mind the house, and do the work at home."
12367,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12368,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a
12369,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"while he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of"
12370,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap"
12371,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then"
12372,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as"
12373,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but"
12374,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over,"
12375,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was"
12376,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite"
12377,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He"
12378,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick"
12379,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered
12380,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every"
12381,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,drop of ale had run out of the cask.
12382,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12383,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the
12384,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at"
12385,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking"
12386,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"cow was still shut up in the stable, and hadn't had a bit to eat or"
12387,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at"
12388,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"once he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd"
12389,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"just get her up on the housetop--for the house, you must know, was"
12390,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now"
12391,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"their house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he"
12392,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cow
12393,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,up.
12394,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12395,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babe"
12396,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"crawling about on the floor, and ""if I leave it,"" he thought, ""the"
12397,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"child is sure to upset it."" So he took the churn on his back, and"
12398,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,went out with it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow
12399,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw
12400,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink,"
12401,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down"
12402,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,into the well.
12403,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12404,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; so"
12405,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water,"
12406,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow"
12407,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So
12408,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast
12409,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"to the cow's neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied"
12410,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began"
12411,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal."
12412,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12413,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the"
12414,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"cow off the housetop after all, and as she fell she dragged the man up"
12415,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the chimney, by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she"
12416,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for"
12417,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,she could neither get down nor up.
12418,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12419,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her
12420,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they
12421,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"had. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home. But"
12422,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she"
12423,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But as she did this,"
12424,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,down came her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old dame
12425,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in"
12426,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,the porridge-pot.

12436,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12437,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12438,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,Once on a time there was an old wife who sat and baked. Now you must
12439,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"know that this old wife had a little son, who was so plump and fat,"
12440,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and so fond of good things, that they called him Buttercup; she had a"
12441,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"dog, too, whose name was Goldtooth, and as she was baking, all at once"
12442,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,Goldtooth began to bark.
12443,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12444,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Run out, Buttercup, there's a dear!"" said the old wife, ""and see what"
12445,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Goldtooth is barking at."""
12446,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12447,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So the boy ran out, and came back crying out,--"
12448,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12449,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Oh, Heaven help us! here comes a great big witch, with her head under"
12450,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"her arm, and a bag at her back."""
12451,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12452,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Jump under the kneading-trough and hide yourself,"" said his mother."
12453,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12454,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,So in came the old hag.
12455,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12456,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good day,"" said she."
12457,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12458,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""God bless you!"" said Buttercup's mother."
12459,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12460,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Isn't your Buttercup at home to-day?"" asked the hag."
12461,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12462,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""No, that he isn't. He's out in the wood with his father, shooting"
12463,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"grouse."""
12464,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12465,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Plague take it,"" said the hag, ""for I had such a nice little silver"
12466,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"knife I wanted to give him."""
12467,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12468,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Pip, pip! here I am,"" said Buttercup under the kneading-trough, and"
12469,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,out he came.
12470,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12471,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I'm so old and stiff in the back,"" said the hag, ""you must creep into"
12472,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the bag and fetch it out for yourself."""
12473,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12474,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"But when Buttercup was well into the bag, the hag threw it over her"
12475,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"back and strode off, and when they had gone a good bit of the way, the"
12476,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"old hag got tired and asked,"
12477,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12478,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""How far is it off to Snoring?"""
12479,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12480,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Half a mile,"" answered Buttercup."
12481,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12482,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So the hag put down the sack on the road, and went aside by herself"
12483,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"into the wood, and lay down to sleep. Meantime Buttercup set to work"
12484,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,and cut a hole in the sack with his knife; then he crept out and put a
12485,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"great root of a fir-tree into the sack, and ran home to his mother."
12486,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12487,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"When the hag got home and saw what there was in the sack, you may"
12488,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,fancy she was in a fine rage.
12489,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12490,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Next day the old wife sat and baked again, and her dog began to bark,"
12491,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,just as he did the day before.
12492,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12493,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Run out, Buttercup, my boy,"" said she, ""and see what Goldtooth is"

12495,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12496,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Well, I never!"" cried Buttercup, as soon as he got out; ""if there"
12497,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,isn't that ugly old beast coming again with her head under her arm and
12498,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"a great sack at her back."""
12499,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12500,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Under the kneading-trough with you and hide,"" said his mother."
12501,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12502,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good day!"" said the hag; ""is your Buttercup at home to-day?"""
12503,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12504,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I'm sorry to say he isn't,"" said his mother; ""he's out in the wood"

12506,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12507,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""What a bore!"" said the hag; ""here I have a beautiful little silver"

12509,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12510,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Pip, pip! here I am,"" said Buttercup, and crept out."
12511,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12512,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I'm so stiff in the back,"" said the old witch, ""you must creep into"
12513,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the sack and fetch it out for yourself."""
12514,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12515,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So when Buttercup was well into the sack, the hag swung it over her"
12516,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,shoulders and set off home as fast as her legs could carry her. But
12517,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"when they had gone a good bit she grew weary, and asked,"
12518,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12519,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""How far is it off to Snoring?"""
12520,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12521,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""A mile and a half,"" answered Buttercup."
12522,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12523,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So the hag set down the sack, and went aside into the wood to sleep"
12524,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"a bit, but while she slept Buttercup made a hole in the sack and got"
12525,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"out, and put a great stone into it. Now, when the old witch got home,"
12526,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"she made a great fire on the hearth, and put a big pot on it, and got"
12527,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"everything ready to boil Buttercup; but when she took the sack, and"
12528,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"thought she was going to turn out Buttercup into the pot, down plumped"
12529,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the stone and made a hole in the bottom of the pot, so that the water"
12530,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,ran out and quenched the fire. Then the old hag was in a dreadful
12531,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"rage, and said, ""If he makes himself ever so heavy next time, he"
12532,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"shan't take me in again."""
12533,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12534,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,The third day everything went just as it had gone twice before;
12535,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Goldtooth began to bark, and Buttercup's mother said to him,"
12536,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12537,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Do run out and see what our dog is barking at."""
12538,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12539,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So out he went, but he soon came back crying out,"

12541,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Heaven save us! Here comes the old hag again with her head under her"
12542,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"arm and a sack at her back."""
12543,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12544,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Jump under the kneading-trough and hide,"" said his mother."
12545,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12546,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good day!"" said the hag, as she came in at the door; ""is your"
12547,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Buttercup at home to-day?"""
12548,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12549,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""You're very kind to ask after him,"" said his mother; ""but he's out in"
12550,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"the wood with his father, shooting grouse."""
12551,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12552,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""What a bore, now,"" said the old hag; ""here have I got such a"
12553,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"beautiful little silver fork for him."""
12554,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12555,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Pip, pip! here I am,"" said Buttercup, as he came out from under the"
12556,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,kneading-trough.
12557,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12558,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""I'm so stiff in the back,"" said the hag, ""you must creep into the"
12559,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"sack and fetch it out for yourself."""
12560,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12561,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,But when Buttercup was well inside the sack the old hag swung it
12562,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"across her shoulders, and set off as fast as she could. This time she"
12563,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"did not turn aside to sleep by the way, but went straight home with"
12564,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Buttercup in the sack, and when she reached her house it was Sunday."
12565,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12566,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,So the old hag said to her daughter:
12567,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12568,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Now you must take Buttercup and kill him, and boil him nicely till I"
12569,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"come back, for I'm off to church to bid my guests to dinner."""
12570,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12571,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So, when all in the house were gone to church, the daughter was to"
12572,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"take Buttercup and kill him, but then she didn't know how to set about"
12573,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,it at all.
12574,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12575,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Stop a bit,"" said Buttercup; ""I'll soon show you how to do it; just"
12576,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"lay your head on the chopping-block, and you'll soon see."""
12577,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12578,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So the poor silly thing laid her head down, and Buttercup took an axe"
12579,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and chopped her head off, just as if she had been a chicken. Then he"
12580,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"laid her head in the bed, and popped her body into the pot, and boiled"
12581,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"it so nicely; and when he had done that, he climbed up on the roof,"
12582,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"and dragged up with him the fir-tree root and the stone, and put one"
12583,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"over the door, and the other at the top of the chimney."
12584,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12585,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"So when the household came back from church, and saw the head on the"
12586,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"bed, they thought it was the daughter who lay there asleep; and then"
12587,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,they thought they would just taste the broth.
12588,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,
12589,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"""Good, by my troth!"
12590,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Buttercup broth,"""
12591,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,

12595,BY GEORGE WEBBE DASENT,"Daughter broth,"""

12631,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12632,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"A tailor sat in his workroom one morning, stitching away busily at a"
12633,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,coat for the Lord Mayor. He whistled and sang so gaily that all the
12634,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,little boys who passed the shop on their way to school thought what a
12635,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"fine thing it was to be a tailor, and told one another that when they"
12636,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"grew to be men they'd be tailors, too."
12637,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12638,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""How hungry I feel, to be sure!"" cried the little man, at last; ""but"
12639,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,I'm far too busy to trouble about eating. I must finish his lordship's
12640,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"coat before I touch a morsel of food,"" and he broke once more into a"
12641,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,merry song.
12642,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12643,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Fine new jam for sale,"" sang out an old woman, as she walked along"
12644,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the street.
12645,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12646,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Jam! I can't resist such a treat,"" said the tailor; and, running to"
12647,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the door, he shouted, ""This way for jam, dame; show me a pot of your"
12648,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"very finest."""
12649,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12650,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The woman handed him jar after jar, but he found fault with all. At"
12651,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,last he hit upon some to his liking.
12652,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12653,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""And how many pounds will you take, sir?"""
12654,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12655,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I'll take four ounces,"" he replied, in a solemn tone, ""and mind you"
12656,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"give me good weight."""
12657,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12658,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The old woman was very angry, for she had expected to sell several"
12659,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"pounds, at least; and she went off grumbling, after she had weighed"
12660,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,out the four ounces.
12661,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12662,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Now for a feed!"" cried the little man, taking a loaf from the"
12663,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"cupboard as he spoke. He cut off a huge slice, and spread the jam on"
12664,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,quite half an inch thick; then he suddenly remembered his work.
12665,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12666,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""It will never do to get jam on the Lord Mayor's coat, so I'll finish"
12667,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"it off before I take even one bite,"" said he. So he picked up his work"
12668,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"once more, and his needle flew in and out like lightning."
12669,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12670,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,I am afraid the Lord Mayor had some stitches in his garment that were
12671,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,quite a quarter of an inch long.
12672,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12673,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The tailor glanced longingly at his slice of bread and jam once or
12674,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"twice, but when he looked the third time it was quite covered with"
12675,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"flies, and a fine feast they were having off it."
12676,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12677,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"This was too much for the little fellow. Up he jumped, crying:"
12678,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12679,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""So you think I provide bread and jam for you, indeed! Well, we'll"
12680,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"very soon see! Take that!"" and he struck the flies such a heavy blow"
12681,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"with a duster that no fewer than seven lay dead upon the table, while"
12682,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the others flew up to the ceiling in great haste.
12683,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12684,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Seven at one blow!"" said the little man with great pride. ""Such a"
12685,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"brave deed ought to be known all over the town, and it won't be my"

12687,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12688,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So he cut out a wide belt, and stitched on it in big golden letters"
12689,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the words ""Seven at one blow."" When this was done he fastened it round"
12690,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"him, crying:"
12691,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12692,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I'm cut out for something better than a tailor, it's quite clear. I'm"
12693,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"one of the world's great heroes, and I'll be off at once to seek my"

12695,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12696,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"He glanced round the cottage, but there was nothing of value to take"
12697,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with him. The only thing he possessed in the world was a small cheese.
12698,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12699,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""You may as well come, too,"" said he, stowing away the cheese in his"
12700,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"pocket, ""and now I'm off."""
12701,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12702,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,When he got into the street the neighbors all crowded round him to
12703,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,read the words on his belt.
12704,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12705,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Seven at one blow!"" said they to one another. ""What a blessing he's"
12706,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,going; for it wouldn't be safe to have a man about us who could kill
12707,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"seven of us at one stroke."""
12708,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12709,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"You see, they didn't know that the tailor had only killed flies; they"
12710,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,took it to mean men.
12711,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12712,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"He jogged along for some miles until he came to a hedge, where a"
12713,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,little bird was caught in the branches.
12714,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12715,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Come along,"" said the tailor; ""I'll have you to keep my cheese"
12716,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"company""; so he caught the bird and put it carefully into his pocket"
12717,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with the cheese.
12718,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12719,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Soon he reached a lofty mountain, and he made up his mind to climb it"
12720,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and see what was going on at the other side. When he reached the top,"
12721,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"there stood a huge giant, gazing down into the valley below."
12722,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12723,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Good day,"" said the tailor."
12724,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12725,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The giant turned round, and seeing nobody but the little tailor there,"
12726,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he cried with scorn:
12727,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12728,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""And what might you be doing here, might I ask? You'd best be off at"
12729,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"once."""
12730,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12731,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Not so fast, my friend,"" said the little man; ""read this."""
12732,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12733,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Seven at one blow,"" read the giant, and he began to wish he'd been"
12734,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,more civil.
12735,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12736,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Well, I'm sure nobody would think it to look at you,"" he replied;"
12737,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""but since you are so clever, do this,"" and he picked up a stone and"
12738,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,squeezed it until water ran out.
12739,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12740,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Do that! Why, it's mere child's play to me,"" and the man took out"
12741,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"his cheese and squeezed it until the whey ran from it. ""Now who is"
12742,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"cleverer?"" asked the tailor. ""You see, I can squeeze milk out, while"
12743,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"you only get water."""
12744,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12745,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The giant was too surprised to utter a word for a few minutes; then,"
12746,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"taking up another stone, he threw it so high into the air that for"
12747,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,a moment they couldn't see where it went; then down it fell to the
12748,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,ground again.
12749,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12750,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Good!"" said the tailor; ""but I'll throw a stone that won't come back"
12751,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"again at all."""
12752,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12753,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Taking the little bird from his pocket, he threw it into the air, and"
12754,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the bird, glad to get away, flew right off and never returned."
12755,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12756,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"This sort of thing didn't suit the giant at all, for he wasn't used to"
12757,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,being beaten by any one.
12758,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12759,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Here's something that you'll never manage,"" said he to the little"
12760,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"man. ""Just come and help me to carry this fallen oak-tree for a few"
12761,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"miles."""
12762,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12763,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Delighted!"" said the tailor, ""and I'll take the end with the"
12764,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"branches, for it's sure to be heavier."""
12765,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12766,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Agreed,"" replied the giant, and he lifted the heavy trunk on to his"
12767,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"shoulder, while the tailor climbed up among the branches at the"
12768,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"other end, and sang with all his might, as though carrying a tree was"
12769,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,nothing to him.
12770,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12771,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The poor giant, who was holding the tree-trunk and the little tailor"
12772,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"as well, soon grew tired."
12773,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12774,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I'm going to let it fall!"" he shouted, and the tailor jumped down"
12775,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"from the branches, and pretended he had been helping all the time."
12776,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12777,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""The idea of a man your size finding a tree too heavy to carry!"""
12778,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,laughed the little tailor.
12779,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12780,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""You are a clever little fellow, and no mistake,"" replied the giant,"
12781,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""and if you'll only come and spend the night in our cave, we shall be"
12782,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"delighted to have you."""
12783,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12784,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I shall have great pleasure in coming, my friend,"" answered the"
12785,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"little tailor, and together they set off for the giant's home."
12786,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12787,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"There were seven more giants in the cave, and each one of them was"
12788,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,eating a roasted pig for his supper. They gave the little man some
12789,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"food, and then showed him a bed in which he might pass the night."
12790,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"It was so big that, after tossing about for half an hour in it, the"
12791,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"tailor thought he would be more comfortable if he slept in the corner,"
12792,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,so he crept out without being noticed.
12793,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12794,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,In the middle of the night the giant stole out of bed and went up to
12795,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the one where he thought the little man was fast asleep. Taking a big
12796,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"bar of iron, he struck such a heavy blow at it that he woke up all the"
12797,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,other giants.
12798,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12799,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Keep quiet, friends,"" said he. ""I've just killed the little scamp."""
12800,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12801,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The tailor made his escape as soon as possible, and he journeyed on"
12802,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for many miles, until he began to feel very tired, so he lay down"
12803,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"under a tree, and was soon fast asleep. When he awoke, he found a big"
12804,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,crowd of people standing round him. Up walked one very wise-looking
12805,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"old man, who was really the King's prime minister."
12806,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12807,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Is it true that you have killed seven at one blow?"" he asked"
12808,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12809,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""It is a fact,"" answered the little tailor."
12810,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12811,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Then come with me to the King, my friend, for he's been searching for"
12812,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,a brave man like you for some time past. You are to be made captain of
12813,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"his army, and the King will give you a fine house to live in."""
12814,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12815,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""That I will,"" replied the little man. ""It is just the sort of thing"
12816,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"that will suit me, and I'll come at once."""
12817,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12818,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,He hadn't been in the King's service long before every one grew
12819,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"jealous of him. The soldiers were afraid that, if they offended him,"
12820,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"he would make short work of them all, while the members of the King's"
12821,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,household didn't fancy the idea of making such a fuss over a stranger.
12822,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12823,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,So the soldiers went in a body to the King and asked that another
12824,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"captain should be put over them, for they were afraid of this one."
12825,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12826,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The King didn't like to refuse, for fear they should all desert, and"
12827,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"yet he didn't dare get rid of the captain, in case such a strong and"
12828,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,brave man should try to have his revenge.
12829,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12830,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,At last the King hit upon a plan. In some woods close by there lived
12831,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"two giants, who were the terror of the country side; they robbed all"
12832,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the travelers, and if any resistance was offered they killed the men"
12833,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,on the spot.
12834,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12835,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Sending for the little tailor, he said:"
12836,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12837,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Knowing you to be the bravest man in my kingdom, I want to ask a"
12838,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"favor of you. If you will kill these two giants, and bring me back"
12839,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"proof that they are dead, you shall marry the Princess, my daughter,"
12840,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and have half my kingdom. You shall also take one hundred men to help
12841,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"you, and you are to set off at once."""
12842,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12843,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""A hundred men, your Majesty! Pray, what do I want with a hundred men?"
12844,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"If I can kill seven at one blow, I needn't be afraid of two. I'll kill"
12845,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"them fast enough, never fear."""
12846,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12847,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The tailor chose ten strong men, and told them to await him on the"
12848,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"border of the wood, while he went on quite alone. He could hear the"
12849,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"giants snoring for quite half an hour before he reached them, so he"
12850,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,knew in which direction to go.
12851,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12852,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"He found the pair fast asleep under a tree, so he filled his pockets"
12853,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with stones and climbed up into the branches over their heads. Then he
12854,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"began to pelt one of the giants with the missiles, until after a few"
12855,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"minutes one of the men awoke. Giving the other a rough push, he cried:"
12856,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12857,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""If you strike me like that again, I'll know the reason why."""
12858,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12859,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I didn't touch you,"" said the other giant crossly, and they were soon"
12860,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,fast asleep once more.
12861,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12862,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the tailor threw stones at the other man, and soon he awoke as"
12863,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the first had done.
12864,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12865,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""What did you throw that at me for?"" said he."
12866,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12867,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""You are dreaming,"" answered the other, ""I didn't throw anything."""
12868,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12869,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"No sooner were they fast asleep again, than the little man began to"
12870,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,pelt them afresh.
12871,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12872,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Up they both sprang, and seizing each other, they began to fight in"
12873,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"real earnest. Not content with using their fists, they tore up huge"
12874,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"trees by the roots, and beat each other until very soon the pair lay"
12875,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,dead on the ground.
12876,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12877,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Down climbed the little tailor, and taking his sword in his hand he"
12878,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"plunged it into each giant, and then went back to the edge of the"
12879,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,forest where the ten men were waiting for him.
12880,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12881,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""They are as dead as two door nails,"" shouted the little man. ""I don't"
12882,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"say that I had an easy task, for they tore up trees by their roots to"
12883,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"try to protect themselves with, but, of course, it was no good. What"

12885,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
12886,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,But the men wouldn't believe it until they went into the forest and
12887,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"saw the two dead bodies, lying each in a pool of blood, while the"
12888,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,ground was covered with uprooted trees.

12910,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The unicorn dashed with such force against the tree that its horn was

12926,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"his way out into the forest again, and while the boar, who was too"
12927,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"big and clumsy to follow, stood gazing at the spot where he had"
12928,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"disappeared, the tailor ran round and closed the door, keeping the"
12929,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"animal quite secure inside. Then he called the hunters, who shot the"

13166,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"come there in one night, excepting little Two Eyes. She supposed it"
13167,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,had grown up from the heart of the goat; for it stood over where she
13168,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,had buried it in the earth.
13169,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13170,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then said the mother to little One Eye, ""Climb up, my child, and break"

13180,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13181,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"One Eye slid down from the tree, and Three Eyes climbed up. But Three"

13184,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,sprang back as she put out her hand.
13185,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13186,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"At last the mother was impatient, and climbed up herself, but with no"

13190,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""May I try?"" said little Two Eyes; ""perhaps I may succeed."""

13194,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13195,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But Two Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not fly back from"
13196,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her when she touched them, but almost laid themselves on her hand,"
13197,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and she plucked them one after another, till she carried down her own"

13199,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13200,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The mother took them from her, and gave them to her sisters, as she"

13205,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13206,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,It happened that while all three sisters were standing under the tree

13212,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13213,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,As the knight came nearer they saw he was a handsome man; and
13214,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"presently he halted, and looked with wonder and pleasure at the"

13216,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13217,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"At last he spoke to the sisters, and asked: ""To whom does this"

13219,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"obtain all he wished for in the world."""
13220,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13221,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""This tree belongs to us,"" said the two sisters, ""and we will break"

13223,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"of trouble in trying to do as they offered; but all to no purpose,"
13224,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for the branches and the fruit evaded their efforts, and sprung back"
13225,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,at every touch.
13226,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13227,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""This is wonderful,"" exclaimed the knight, ""that the tree should"

13229,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13230,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"They persisted, however, in declaring that the tree was their own"
13231,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"property. At this moment little Two Eyes, who was angry because her"
13232,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sisters had not told the truth, caused two of the golden apples to"
13233,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"slip out from under the cask, and they rolled on till they reached the"
13234,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"feet of the knight's horse. When he saw them, he asked in astonishment"
13235,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,where they came from.
13236,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13237,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The two ugly maidens replied that they had another sister, but they"
13238,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"dared not let him see her, for she had only two eyes, like common"

13240,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13241,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But the knight felt very anxious to see her, and called out, ""Little"

13244,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13245,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then he said: ""Little Two Eyes, can you break off a branch of the tree"
13246,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for me?"""
13247,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13248,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Oh yes,"" she replied, ""I can, very easily, for the tree belongs to"
13249,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"me."" And she climbed up, and, without any trouble, broke off a branch"
13250,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with its silver leaves and golden fruit and gave it to the knight.
13251,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13252,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"He looked down at her as she stood by his horse, and said: ""Little Two"
13253,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Eyes, what shall I give you for this?"""
13254,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13255,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Ah!"" she answered, ""I suffer from hunger and thirst, and sorrow, and"
13256,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"trouble, from early morning till late at night; if you would only take"
13257,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"me with you, and release me, I should be so happy."""
13258,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13259,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the knight lifted the little maiden on his horse, and rode home"
13260,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with her to his father's castle. There she was given beautiful clothes
13261,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to wear, and as much to eat and drink as she wished, and as she grew"
13262,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,up the young knight loved her so dearly that they were married with
13263,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,great rejoicings.
13264,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13265,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Now, when the two sisters saw little Two Eyes carried away by the"
13266,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"handsome young knight, they were overjoyed at their good fortune. ""The"
13267,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"wonderful tree belongs to us now,"" they said; ""even if we cannot break"
13268,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"off a branch, yet everybody who passes will stop to admire it, and"
13269,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"make acquaintance with us, and, who knows? we may get husbands after"
13270,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"all."""
13271,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13272,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But when they rose the next morning, lo! the tree had vanished, and"
13273,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"with it all their hopes. And on this very morning, when little Two"
13274,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Eyes looked out of her chamber window of the castle, she saw, to her"
13275,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"great joy, that the tree had followed her."
13276,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13277,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Little Two Eyes lived for a long time in great happiness; but she
13278,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"heard nothing of her sisters, till one day two poor women came to"
13279,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the castle, to beg for alms. Little Two Eyes saw them, and, looking"
13280,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"earnestly in their faces, she recognized her two sisters, who had"
13281,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,become so poor that they were obliged to beg their bread from door to
13282,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,door.
13283,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13284,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But the good sister received them most kindly, and promised to take"
13285,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,care of them and give them all they wanted. And then they did indeed
13286,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,repent and feel sorry for having treated her so badly in their

13301,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,quite unfit for work. So his master began to consider how much he

13344,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13345,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The cock consented to this plan, and so all four traveled on together."
13346,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"They could not, however, reach Bremen in one day, and at evening they"
13347,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"came into a forest, where they meant to pass the night. The ass and"
13348,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the dog laid themselves down under a large tree, the cat and the cock"
13349,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"climbed up into the branches, but the latter flew right to the top,"
13350,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,where he was most safe. Before he went to sleep he looked all round
13351,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the four quarters, and soon thought he saw a little spark in the"
13352,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"distance; so, calling his companions, he said they were not far from"
13353,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"a house, for he saw a light. The ass said: ""If it is so, we had better"
13354,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"get up and go farther, for the pasturage here is very bad""; and the"
13355,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"dog continued: ""Yes, indeed! a couple of bones with some meat on would"

13357,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"light was, and which shone now brighter and brighter, until they came"
13358,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to a well-lighted robber's cottage. The ass, as the biggest, went to"
13359,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the window and peeped in. ""What do you see, Gray-horse?"" asked the"
13360,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"cock. ""What do I see?"" replied the ass; ""a table laid out with savory"
13361,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"meats and drinks, with robbers sitting around enjoying themselves."""
13362,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13363,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""That would be the right sort of thing for us,"" said the cock."
13364,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13365,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Yes, yes, I wish we were there,"" replied the ass. Then these animals"
13366,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,took counsel together how they should contrive to drive away the
13367,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"robbers, and at last they thought of a way. The ass placed his"
13368,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"forefeet upon the window ledge, the hound got on his back, the cat"
13369,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"climbed up upon the dog, and, lastly, the cock flew up and perched"
13370,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"upon the head of the cat. When this was accomplished, at a given"
13371,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"signal they commenced together to perform their music: the ass brayed,"
13372,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crew; and they made such"
13373,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"a tremendous noise, and so loud, that the panes of the window were"
13374,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"shivered! Terrified at these unearthly sounds, the robbers got up with"
13375,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"great precipitation, thinking nothing less than that some spirits had"
13376,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"come, and fled off into the forest, so the four companions immediately"
13377,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sat down at the table, and quickly ate up all that was left, as if"
13378,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,they had been fasting for six weeks.
13379,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13380,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"As soon as they had finished, they extinguished the light, and each"
13381,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sought for himself a sleeping-place, according to his nature and"
13382,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"custom. The ass laid himself down upon some straw, the hound behind"
13383,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the door, the cat upon the hearth, near the warm ashes, and the cock"
13384,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,flew up on a beam which ran across the room. Weary with their long
13385,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"walk, they soon went to sleep."
13386,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13387,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,At midnight the robbers perceived from their retreat that no light was
13388,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"burning in their house, and all appeared quiet; so the captain said:"
13389,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""We need not have been frightened into fits""; and, calling one of the"
13390,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"band, he sent him forward to reconnoiter. The messenger, finding"
13391,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"all still, went into the kitchen to strike a light, and, taking the"
13392,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"glistening, fiery eyes of the cat for live coals, he held a"
13393,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"lucifer match to them, expecting it to take fire. But the cat, not"
13394,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"understanding the joke, flew in his face, spitting and scratching,"
13395,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"which dreadfully frightened him, so that he made for the back door;"
13396,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"but the dog, who laid there, sprang up and bit his leg; and as he"
13397,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"limped upon the straw where the ass was stretched out, it gave him"
13398,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"a powerful kick with its hind foot. This was not all, for the cock,"
13399,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"awaking at the noise, clapped his wings, and cried from the beam:"
13400,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Cock-a-doodle-doo, cock-a-doodle-do!"""
13401,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13402,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the robber ran back as well as he could to his captain, and said:"
13403,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Ah, my master, there dwells a horrible witch in the house, who spat"
13404,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,on me and scratched my face with her long nails; and then before the

13406,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"there lies a black monster, who beat me with a great wooden club; and"
13407,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"besides all, upon the roof sits a judge, who called out, 'Bring the"

13409,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13410,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,After this the robbers dared not again go near their house; but
13411,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"everything prospered so well with the four town musicians of Bremen,"

13429,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he hauled it up there was a great flounder on the end of the line. The
13430,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"flounder said to him: ""Look here, fisherman, don't you kill me; I am"

13439,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13440,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Then the fisherman got up and went back to his wife in the hovel.

13603,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he found everything was marble and gold; and the hangings were of

13702,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the dark clouds, but toward the south they were red and heavy, as in a"
13703,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"bad storm. In despair, he stood and said;"
13704,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13705,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Flounder, flounder in the sea,"
13706,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Prythee, hearken unto me:"
13707,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"My wife, Ilsebil, will have her own way"
13708,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Whatever I wish, whatever I say."""
13709,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13710,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Now, what does she want?"" said the flounder."
13711,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13712,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Alas"" said the man, ""she wants to be pope."""
13713,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13714,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Go back. Pope she is,"" said the flounder."
13715,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13716,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So back he went, and he found a great church, surrounded with palaces."
13717,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"He pressed through the crowd, and inside he found thousands and"
13718,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"thousand of lights, and his wife, entirely clad in gold, was sitting"
13719,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"on a still higher throne, with three golden crowns upon her head, and"
13720,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,she was surrounded with priestly state. On each side of her were two
13721,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"rows of candles, the biggest as thick as a tower, down to the tiniest"
13722,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"little taper. Kings and emperors were on their knees before her,"
13723,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,kissing her shoe.
13724,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13725,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Wife,"" said the man, looking at her, ""art thou now pope?"""
13726,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13727,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Yes,"" said she; ""now I am pope."""
13728,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13729,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So there he stood gazing at her, and it was like looking at a shining"
13730,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,sun.
13731,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13732,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Alas, wife,"" he said, ""art thou better off for being pope?"" At first"
13733,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"she sat as stiff as a post, without stirring. Then he said, ""Now,"
13734,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"wife, be content with being pope; higher thou canst not go."""
13735,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13736,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I will think about that,"" said the woman, and with that they both"
13737,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"went to bed. Still she was not content, and could not sleep for her"
13738,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"inordinate desires. The man slept well and soundly, for he had walked"
13739,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,about a great deal in the day; but his wife could think of nothing
13740,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,but what further grandeur she could demand. When the dawn reddened the
13741,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sky, she raised herself up in bed and looked out of the window, and"
13742,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,when she saw the sun rise she said:
13743,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13744,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Ha! can I not cause the sun and the moon to rise? Husband!"" she"
13745,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"cried, digging her elbow into his side, ""wake up and go to the"
13746,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"flounder. I will be lord of the universe."""
13747,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13748,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Her husband, who was still more than half asleep, was so shocked that"
13749,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he fell out of bed. He thought he must have heard wrong. He rubbed his
13750,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,eyes and said:
13751,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13752,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Alas, wife, what didst thou say?"""
13753,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13754,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Husband,"" she said, ""if I cannot be lord of the universe, and cause"
13755,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the sun and moon to set and rise, I shall not be able to bear it. I"
13756,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"shall never have another happy moment."""
13757,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13758,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,She looked at him so wildly that it caused a shudder to run through
13759,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,him.
13760,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13761,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Alas, wife,"" he said, falling on his knees before her, ""the flounder"
13762,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"can't do that. Emperor and pope he can make, but that is indeed beyond"
13763,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"him. I pray thee, control thyself and remain pope."""
13764,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13765,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Then she flew into a terrible rage. Her hair stood on end; she panted
13766,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for breath, and screamed:"
13767,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13768,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I won't bear it any longer; wilt thou go?"""
13769,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13770,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Then he pulled on his trousers and tore away like a madman. Such a
13771,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,storm was raging that he could hardly keep his feet; houses and trees
13772,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"quivered and swayed, mountains trembled, and the rocks rolled into the"
13773,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sea. The sky was pitchy black; it thundered and lightened, and the"
13774,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sea ran in black waves, mountains high, crested with white foam. He"
13775,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"shrieked out, but could hardly make himself heard:"
13776,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13777,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Flounder, flounder in the sea,"

13781,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13782,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Now, what does she want?"" asked the flounder."
13783,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13784,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Alas,"" he said, ""she wants to be Lord of the Universe."""
13785,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13786,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Now she must go back to her old hovel,"" said the flounder; ""and there"
13787,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"you will find her."""
13788,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13789,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And there they are to this very day!

13800,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13801,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Once upon a time it was the middle of winter; the flakes of snow were
13802,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"falling like feathers from the sky; a Queen sat at a window sewing,"
13803,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. As she was sewing
13804,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with"
13805,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red"
13806,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself:"
13807,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13808,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as"
13809,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"black as the wood of the window-frame!"" Soon after that she had a"
13810,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and"
13811,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,her hair was as black as ebony; so she was called Little Snow-white.
13812,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And when the child was born, the Queen died."
13813,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13814,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"A year after, the King took to himself another wife. She was beautiful"
13815,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"but proud, and she could not bear to have any one else more beautiful."
13816,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"She had a wonderful Looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it,"
13817,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and looked at herself in it, and said:"
13818,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13819,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,"
13820,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Who in this land is the fairest of all?"""
13821,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13822,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the Looking-glass answered:
13823,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13824,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!"""
13825,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13826,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"At last she was well pleased, for she knew the Looking-glass spoke the"
13827,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,truth.
13828,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13829,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Now Snow-white grew up, and became more and more beautiful; and when"
13830,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more"
13831,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the queen asked her
13832,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Looking-glass:
13833,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13834,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,"
13835,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Who in this land is the fairest of all?"""
13836,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13837,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,it answered:
13838,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13839,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen,"
13840,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But more beautiful by far is Snow-white, I ween."""
13841,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13842,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the Queen was angry, and turned green with envy. From that hour,"
13843,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"whenever she looked at Snow-white, her breath came and went, she hated"
13844,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the girl so much.
13845,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13846,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And envy grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she"
13847,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said:"
13848,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13849,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Take the child away into the wood; I will no longer have her in my"
13850,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token."" The huntsman"
13851,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"did as he was told, and took her away; but when he had drawn his knife,"
13852,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and was about to pierce Snow-white's little heart, she began to weep,"
13853,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and said:
13854,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13855,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Ah, dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild"
13856,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"wood, and never come home again."""
13857,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13858,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said:
13859,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13860,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Run away, then, you poor child."" The wild beasts will soon kill her,"
13861,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,thought he; and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his
13862,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"heart, since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. As a young"
13863,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"boar just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its heart"
13864,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and took it to the Queen as a proof that the child was dead. The cook
13865,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had"
13866,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,eaten the heart of Snow-white.
13867,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13868,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But now the poor child was all alone in the great wood, and so afraid"
13869,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"that she started at every bush, and did not know what to do. Then she"
13870,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the"
13871,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm."
13872,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13873,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"She ran as long as her feet would go, until it was almost evening;"
13874,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"then she saw a little cottage, and went into it to rest herself."
13875,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than"
13876,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven"
13877,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"little plates, and by each plate was a little spoon; there were seven"
13878,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood"
13879,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"seven little beds side by side, covered with snow-white coverlets."
13880,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13881,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Little Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some fruit
13882,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and bread from each plate, and drank a drop of milk out of each mug,"
13883,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as she was so"
13884,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"tired, she lay down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited"
13885,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her; one was too long, another too short; but at last she found the"
13886,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"seventh one was just right, and so she stayed in it, said her prayers,"
13887,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and went to sleep.
13888,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13889,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,When it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back; they
13890,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,were seven dwarfs who dug in the hills for gold. They lit their seven
13891,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they could see"
13892,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"that some one had been there, for everything was not in the same order"
13893,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,in which they had left it.
13894,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13895,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The first said, ""Who has been sitting on my chair?"""
13896,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13897,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The second, ""Who has been eating off my plate?"""
13898,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13899,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The third, ""Who has been taking some of my bread?"""
13900,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13901,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The fourth, ""Who has been eating my fruit?"""
13902,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13903,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The fifth, ""Who has been using my fork?"""
13904,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13905,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The sixth, ""Who has been cutting with my knife?"""
13906,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13907,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The seventh, ""Who has been drinking out of my mug?"""
13908,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13909,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole in
13910,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"his bed, and he said:"
13911,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13912,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Who has been getting into my bed?"" The others came up and each called"
13913,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,out:
13914,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13915,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Somebody has been lying in my bed too."" But the seventh, when he"
13916,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"looked at his bed, saw little Snow-white, who was lying asleep there."
13917,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out with"
13918,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"wonder, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall"
13919,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,on little Snow-white.
13920,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13921,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!"" cried they, ""what a lovely child!"" and"
13922,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"they were so glad that they did not wake her, but let her sleep on in"
13923,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the bed. And the seventh dwarf slept with the others, one hour with"
13924,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"each, and so got through the night."
13925,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13926,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was afraid when she"
13927,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her
13928,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,name was.
13929,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13930,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""My name is Snow-white,"" she answered."
13931,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13932,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""How have you come to our house?"" said the dwarfs. Then she told them"
13933,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"that the Queen had wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman"
13934,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"had spared her life; she had run for the whole day, until at last she"
13935,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,had found their house. The dwarfs said:
13936,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13937,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew,"
13938,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and knit; and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay"
13939,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"with us, and you shall want for nothing."""
13940,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13941,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Yes,"" said Snow-white, ""with all my heart,"" and she stayed with them."
13942,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,She kept the house in order for them; in the mornings they went to the
13943,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"hills and looked for gold; in the evenings they came back, and then"
13944,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"their supper had to be ready. The girl was alone the whole day, so the"
13945,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,good dwarfs warned her and said:
13946,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13947,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Beware of the Queen; she will soon know that you are here; be sure to"
13948,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"let no one come in."""
13949,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13950,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But the Queen, thinking she had eaten Snow-white's heart, began to"
13951,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,suppose she was again the first and most beautiful person in the
13952,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,world; and she went to her Looking-glass and said:
13953,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13954,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,"
13955,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Who in this land is the fairest of all?"""
13956,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13957,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And the Glass answered:
13958,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13959,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""O Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,"
13960,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,"
13961,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Snow-white is still alive and well,"
13962,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And no one else is so fair as she."""
13963,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13964,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And so she thought and thought again how she might kill Snow-white,"
13965,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her"
13966,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"have no rest. And when she had at last thought of something to do, she"
13967,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"painted her face and dressed herself like an old peddler-woman, and"
13968,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,no one could have known her. Then she went over the seven hills to the
13969,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried:"
13970,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13971,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap."" Little Snow-white"
13972,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,looked out of the window and called out:
13973,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13974,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Good-day, my good woman, what have you to sell?"""
13975,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
13976,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Good things, pretty things,"" she answered; ""stay-laces of all"
13977,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"colors,"" and she pulled out one which was woven of bright silk."
13978,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,

14108,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were"

14110,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14111,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""We could not bury her in the dark ground,"" and they had a coffin of"

14114,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"was a King's daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the hill, and"
14115,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"one of them always stayed by it and watched it. And birds came too,"
14116,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove."
14117,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14118,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did"

14121,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14122,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"It happened that a King's son came into the wood, and went to the"

14124,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it"
14125,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs:
14126,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14127,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it."""
14128,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,But the dwarfs answered:
14129,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14130,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""We will not part with it for all the gold in the world."" Then he"
14131,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,said:
14132,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14133,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing"

14137,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14138,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their
14139,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and"
14140,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with the shock the piece of apple which Snow-white had bitten off came
14141,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the"

14143,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14144,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Oh, heavens, where am I?"" she cried. The King's son, full of joy,"

14166,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young"
14167,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still
14168,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already"
14169,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set"

14255,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,became alarmed lest he should betray the secret of her treachery. She
14256,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,told the Prince that the horse which had brought her was vicious and
14257,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"had given her much trouble, and that she desired his head cut off"
14258,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"immediately. The Prince at once granted her request, and gave orders"
14259,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,that Falada be beheaded.

14261,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When the real Princess heard the sad news, she dried her tears and"
14262,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,sought the executioner. She could not save her dear Falada from his
14263,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"doom, but with the aid of a gold piece she persuaded the slaughterer"
14264,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,to nail his head over the great gate through which she had to pass on
14265,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,her way to and from the goose-pasture.

14278,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When she had driven the geese to the field, she sat down and loosed"
14279,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her golden hair. Curdken, seeing it shining in the sun, caught at it"
14280,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,to pull some out. Whereupon she sang:
14281,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14282,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Wind, blow gently here, I pray,"
14283,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And take Curdken's hat away.

14303,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"when she came to the field where they were herded, sat down and loosed"
14304,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her hair. The sun shone upon it, and Curdken again caught at its"
14305,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,golden threads. The goose-girl called to the wind:
14306,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14307,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Wind, blow gently here, I pray,"
14308,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,And take Curdken's hat away.

14312,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The wind did as she asked, and Curdken ran so far for his hat that"
14313,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,when he returned the golden hair was plaited and bound about her head.
14314,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14315,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Curdken was sullen all day long, and when at night they had driven the"
14316,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"geese home, he complained to the King:"

14318,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""The goose-girl so teases me that I will no longer herd the geese with"

14321,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When asked how she had offended, he told the King that she spoke every"
14322,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"morning to the horse's head that was over the gate, and that the head"
14323,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,replied and called her Princess. He also related how the goose-girl
14324,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"sat in the sun and combed her golden hair, while she sent him chasing"
14325,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,for his hat.
14326,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14327,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The King bade Curdken go the next day with his flock as usual. When
14328,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,morning came the King arose early and stood in the shadow of the
14329,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"town-gate. He heard the goose-girl say, ""O Falada, hang you there?"""
14330,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and he heard the head make answer:

14335,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14336,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the King followed on to the field, where he hid behind a bush"
14337,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and watched them herd the geese. After a time the goose-girl undid
14338,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her glittering hair; and as Curdken snatched at it, the King heard her"
14339,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,say:

14341,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Wind, blow gently here, I pray,"

14348,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14349,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The King quietly returned to the palace, and that night he sent for"
14350,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the goose-girl. He told her he had watched her at the gate and in the

14359,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and poured forth her sorrows:

14364,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14365,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"She sobbed and wept, until the King, who had stood outside and heard"
14366,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"all, came in and bade her dry her eyes. He ordered her arrayed in"
14367,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,royal robes; and then she appeared as lovely as the sun. The Prince
14368,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"was summoned; and the old King told him the story, and showed him the"
14369,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,true bride. She was so beautiful that the Prince knelt at her feet in
14370,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"admiration, and knew her to be the real Princess."
14371,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14372,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"A great banquet was given, to which many guests were invited. On one"

14375,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The King at last asked the waiting-maid what punishment should be

14378,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Not knowing that she was passing sentence on herself, the"

14399,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,There was once a King who had a beautiful pleasure-garden behind his
14400,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"palace, in which grew a tree that bore golden apples. As fast as the"
14401,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"apples ripened they were counted, but the next day one was always"
14402,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,missing.
14403,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14404,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"This was made known to the King, who commanded that a watch should be"
14405,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"kept every night under the tree. Now, the King had three sons, and"
14406,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he sent the eldest into the garden when night was coming on; but at
14407,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"midnight he fell fast asleep, and in the morning another apple was"
14408,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"missing. The following night the second son had to watch, but he did"
14409,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"not succeed any better, and again another apple was missing in the"
14410,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"morning. Now came the turn of the youngest son, who was eager to go;"
14411,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"but the King did not rely much upon him, and thought he would watch"
14412,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"even worse than his brothers; however, at last he consented."
14413,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14414,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The youth threw himself on the ground under the tree and watched
14415,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"steadily, without letting sleep master him. As twelve o'clock"
14416,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"struck, something rustled in the air, and he saw a bird fly by in the"
14417,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"moonlight, whose feathers were of shining gold. The bird alighted on"
14418,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the tree and was just picking off one of the apples when the young
14419,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Prince shot a bolt at it. Away flew the bird, but the arrow had"
14420,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"knocked off one of its feathers, which was of the finest gold. The"
14421,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"youth picked it up and showed it to the King next morning, and told"
14422,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,him all he had seen in the night.
14423,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14424,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Thereupon the King assembled his council, and each one declared that"
14425,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,a single feather like this one was of greater value than the whole

14427,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14428,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""However valuable this feather may be,"" said the King, ""one will not"

14430,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14431,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So the eldest son went forth on his travels, to look for the wonderful"

14433,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14434,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When he had gone a short distance, he saw a fox sitting close to the"

14437,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"are now on the road to the golden bird, and this evening you will come"

14440,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"do not, however, go in, but rather enter the other, even though it"

14443,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""How can such a ridiculous animal give me rational advice?"" thought"
14444,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the young Prince, and shot at the fox, but missed it, so it ran away"
14445,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"with its tail in the air. The King's son then walked on, and in the"
14446,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,evening he came to a village where the two inns stood: in one there
14447,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"was dancing and singing, but the other was quiet, and had a very mean"
14448,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and wretched appearance.
14449,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14450,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I should be an idiot,"" thought he to himself, ""if I were to go"
14451,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to this gloomy old inn while the other is so bright and cheerful."""
14452,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Therefore, he went into the merry one, lived there in rioting and"
14453,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"revelry, and so forgot the golden bird, his father, and all good"

14455,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14456,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"As time passed away, and the eldest son did not return home, the"
14457,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,second son set out on his travels to seek the golden bird. Like the
14458,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"eldest brother, he met with the fox, and did not follow the good"
14459,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"advice it gave him. He likewise came to the two inns, and at the"
14460,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,window of the noisy one his brother stood entreating him to come in.
14461,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"This he could not resist, so he went in, and began to live a life of"

14463,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14464,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Again a long time passed by without any news, so the youngest Prince"

14466,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for the sake of peace, the King was obliged to consent, for he had no"
14467,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,rest as long as he refused. The fox was again sitting at the edge of
14468,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the forest, and once more it begged for its own life and gave its good"
14469,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"advice. The youth was good-hearted, and said:"
14470,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14471,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Have no fear, little fox; I will not do thee any harm."""
14472,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14473,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Thou wilt never repent of thy good nature,"" replied the fox, ""and in"

14475,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14476,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Scarcely had the youth seated himself, when away went the fox over"

14478,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When they came to the village, the youth dismounted, and following the"
14479,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"fox's advice, he turned at once into the shabby-looking inn, where he"
14480,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"slept peacefully through the night. The next morning, when the Prince"
14481,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"went into the fields, the fox was already there, and said:"
14482,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14483,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I will tell thee what further thou must do. Go straight on, and thou"
14484,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,wilt come to a castle before which a whole troop of soldiers will be
14485,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"lying asleep. Go right through the midst of them into the castle, and"
14486,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,thou wilt come to a chamber where is hanging a wooden cage containing
14487,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"a golden bird. Close by stands an empty golden cage, for show; but be"
14488,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,careful that thou dost not take the bird out of its ugly cage and put
14489,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"it in the splendid one, or it will be very unlucky for thee."""
14490,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14491,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"With these words the fox once more stretched out its tail, and the"
14492,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"King's son sat upon it again, and away they went over hill and dale,"
14493,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,with their hair whistling in the wind.
14494,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14495,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When they arrived at the castle, the Prince found everything as the"
14496,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"fox had said, and he soon discovered the room in which the golden bird"
14497,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,was sitting in its wooden cage; by it stood a golden one; while three
14498,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,golden apples were lying about the room. But the Prince thought it
14499,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,would be silly to put such a lovely bird in so ugly and common a cage;
14500,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"so, opening the door, he placed it in the golden cage. In an instant"
14501,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the bird set up a piercing shriek, which awakened all the soldiers,"
14502,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,who rushed in and made him prisoner.
14503,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14504,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The next morning he was brought before a judge, who at once condemned"

14507,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,ran faster than the wind; and if he succeeded he should also receive

14509,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14510,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The young Prince set out on his journey, but he sighed and felt very"

14516,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and tell thee how thou mayest discover the horse. Thou must travel
14517,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,straight along this road until thou comest to a castle; the horse is
14518,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,there in one of the stables. Thou wilt find a stable boy lying before
14519,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the stall, but he will be fast asleep and snoring, so thou wilt be"
14520,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,able to lead out the golden horse quite quietly. But there is one
14521,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"thing thou must be careful about, and that is to put on the shabby old"

14527,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Everything happened as the fox had said. The Prince came to the stable
14528,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"where the golden horse was standing, but, as he was about to put on"
14529,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the shabby old saddle, he thought to himself, ""It does seem a shame"
14530,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,that such a lovely animal should be disgraced with this. The fine
14531,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"saddle is his by right; it must go on."""
14532,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14533,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Scarcely had the golden saddle rested on the horse's back when it
14534,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"began to neigh loudly. This awakened the stable boy, who awakened the"
14535,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"grooms, who rushed in and seized the Prince and made him a prisoner."
14536,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The following morning he was brought to trial and condemned to death,"
14537,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"but the King promised him his life, as well as the golden horse, if"
14538,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the youth could find the beautiful daughter of the King of the golden
14539,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"castle. Once more, with a heavy heart, the Prince set out on his"
14540,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"journey, and by great good fortune he soon came across the faithful"
14541,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,fox.
14542,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14543,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I really should have left thee to the consequences of thy folly,"""
14544,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"said the fox; ""but as I feel great compassion for thee, I will help"
14545,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,thee out of thy new misfortune. The path to the castle lies straight
14546,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"before thee; thou wilt reach it about the evening. At night, when"
14547,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"everything is quiet, the lovely Princess will go to the bath-house, to"
14548,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"bathe there. As soon as she enters, thou must spring forward and give"
14549,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,her a kiss; then she will follow thee wherever thou carest to lead
14550,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"her; only be careful that she does not take leave of her parents, or"
14551,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"everything will go wrong."""
14552,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14553,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then the fox stretched out his tail, the Prince seated himself on it,"
14554,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and away they both went over hill and dale, their hair whistling in"
14555,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the wind.
14556,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14557,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When the King's son came to the golden palace, everything happened as"
14558,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the fox had predicted. He waited until midnight, and when everyone was"
14559,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"soundly asleep the beautiful Princess went into the bath-house, so"
14560,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he sprang forward and kissed her. The Princess then said she would
14561,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"joyfully follow him, but she besought him with tears in her eyes to"
14562,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,allow her to say farewell to her parents. At first he withstood her
14563,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"entreaties, but as she wept still more, and fell at his feet, he at"
14564,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,last yielded.
14565,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14566,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Scarcely was the maiden at the bedside of her father, when he awoke,"
14567,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and so did everyone else in the palace; so the foolish youth was
14568,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,captured and put into prison.
14569,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14570,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"On the following morning the King said to him: ""Thy life is forfeited,"
14571,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and thou canst only find mercy if thou clearest away the mountain that
14572,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"lies before my windows, and over which I cannot see, but it must be"
14573,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,removed within eight days. If thou dost succeed thou shalt have my
14574,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"daughter as a reward."""
14575,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14576,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,So the Prince commenced at once to dig and to shovel away the earth
14577,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"without cessation, but when after seven days he saw how little he had"
14578,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"been able to accomplish, and that all his labor was as nothing, he"
14579,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,fell into a great grief and gave up all hope.
14580,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14581,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"On the evening of the seventh day, however, the fox appeared. ""Thou"
14582,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"dost not deserve that I should take thy part or befriend thee, but do"
14583,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"thou go away and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for thee."""
14584,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14585,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"And the next morning, when he awoke and looked out of the window, the"
14586,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"mountain had disappeared! Then the Prince, quite overjoyed, hastened"
14587,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to the King and told him that the conditions were fulfilled, so that"
14588,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the King, whether he would or not, was obliged to keep his word and"
14589,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,give him his daughter.
14590,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14591,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then these two went away together, and it was not long before the"
14592,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,faithful fox came to them.
14593,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14594,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Thou hast indeed gained the best of all,"" said he; ""but to the maiden"
14595,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"of the golden castle belongs also the golden horse."""
14596,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14597,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""How can I get it?"" enquired the youth."
14598,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14599,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""I will tell thee,"" answered the fox; ""first of all, take the lovely"
14600,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Princess to the King who sent you to the golden palace. There will
14601,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,then be unheard-of joy; they will gladly lead the golden horse to thee
14602,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"and give it thee. Mount it instantly, and give your hand to everyone"
14603,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"at parting, and last of all to the Princess. Grasp her hand firmly;"
14604,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"make her spring into the saddle behind thee, and then gallop away; no"
14605,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"one will be able to overtake thee, for the golden horse runs faster"
14606,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"than the wind."""
14607,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14608,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"This was all happily accomplished, and the King's son carried off the"
14609,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"beautiful Princess on the golden horse. The fox did not remain behind,"
14610,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and spoke thus to the young Prince:
14611,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14612,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Now I will help thee to find the golden bird. When thou comest near"
14613,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the castle where the bird is to be found, let the Princess dismount,"
14614,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and I will take her under my protection. Then ride on the golden horse
14615,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to the courtyard of the palace, where thy coming will cause great joy,"
14616,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,and they will fetch the golden bird for thee. Directly the cage is in
14617,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"thy hands, gallop back to us and fetch the maiden again."""
14618,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14619,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"When this plot was successfully carried out, and the Prince was about"
14620,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"to ride home with his treasure, the fox said, ""Now must thou reward me"
14621,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"for all my services."""
14622,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14623,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""What is it that thou dost desire?"" enquired the Prince."
14624,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14625,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""When we come to yonder wood, thou must shoot me dead and cut off my"
14626,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"head and paws."""
14627,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14628,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""That would be a fine sort of gratitude,"" said the King's son; ""that I"
14629,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"cannot possibly promise thee."""
14630,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14631,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Then,"" replied the fox, ""if thou wilt not, I must leave thee; but"
14632,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,before I go I will give thee again some good advice. Beware of two
14633,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"things--buy no gallows'-flesh, and see that thou dost not sit on the"
14634,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"brink of a well!"""
14635,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14636,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,With this the fox ran off into the forest!
14637,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14638,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Ah!"" thought the young Prince, ""that is a wonderful animal with very"
14639,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"whimsical ideas! Who would buy gallows'-flesh, and when have I ever"
14640,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"had the slightest desire to sit on the brink of a well?"""
14641,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14642,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So he rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his path led him once"
14643,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,more through the village in which his two brothers had stopped. Here
14644,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"there was great tumult and lamentation, and when he asked what it all"
14645,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"meant, he was told that two men were going to be hanged. When he came"
14646,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"nearer, he saw that they were his two brothers, who had committed"
14647,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,every kind of wicked folly and had squandered all their money. Then
14648,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,the young Prince asked if they could not be freed.
14649,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14650,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Supposing you do pay for them,"" the people answered, ""where is the"
14651,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"good of wasting your money in order to free such villains?"""
14652,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14653,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Nevertheless, he did not hesitate, but paid for them, and when the"
14654,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,brothers were freed they all rode away together. They came to the
14655,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"forest where they first encountered the fox, and as it was cool and"
14656,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"pleasant away from the burning sun, the two brothers said:"
14657,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14658,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Let us sit and rest a little by this well, and eat and drink"
14659,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"something."""
14660,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14661,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The young Prince consented, and while they were all talking together"
14662,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"he quite forgot the fox's warning, and suspected no evil."
14663,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14664,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"But suddenly the two brothers threw him backwards into the well, and,"
14665,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"seizing the maiden, the horse, and the golden bird, they went home to"
14666,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,their father.
14667,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14668,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""We not only bring you the golden bird,"" said they, ""but we have also"
14669,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"found the golden palace."""
14670,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14671,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"There was great rejoicing, but the horse would not eat, neither would"
14672,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the bird sing, and the maiden only sat and wept."
14673,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14674,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,But the youngest brother had not perished. By good fortune the well
14675,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"was dry, and he had fallen on soft moss without hurting himself, but"
14676,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,he could not get out again.
14677,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14678,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Even in this misfortune the faithful fox did not desert him, but came"
14679,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,springing down to him and scolded him for not following his advice.
14680,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14681,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Still I cannot forsake thee,"" said he, ""and I will help to show thee"
14682,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"daylight once more."""
14683,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14684,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,Then he told him to seize hold of his tail and hold on tightly; and so
14685,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"saying, he lifted him up in the air."
14686,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14687,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Even now thou art not out of danger,"" said the fox, ""for thy brothers"
14688,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"were not certain of thy death, and have set spies to watch for thee in"
14689,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"the forest, who will certainly kill thee if they see thee."""
14690,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14691,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,There was an old man sitting by the wayside with whom the young Prince
14692,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"changed clothes, and, thus disguised, he reached the court of the"
14693,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,King.
14694,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14695,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"No one recognized him, but the golden bird began to sing, and the"
14696,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"golden horse commenced to eat, and the lovely maiden ceased to weep."
14697,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14698,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"The King was astonished and asked: ""What does this all mean?"""
14699,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14700,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then said the maiden: ""I know not, but I was so sad, and now I feel"
14701,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"light-hearted; it is as if my true husband had returned."""
14702,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14703,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Then she told him all that had happened, although the other brothers"
14704,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,had threatened to kill her if she betrayed them.
14705,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14706,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,The King then summoned all the people in the castle before him: and
14707,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"there came with them the young Prince dressed as a beggar in his rags,"
14708,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,but the maiden recognized him instantly and fell upon his neck.
14709,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14710,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"So the wicked brothers were seized and executed, but the young Prince"
14711,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,married the lovely Princess and was made his father's heir.
14712,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14713,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,But what became of the poor fox?
14714,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14715,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"Long afterwards the young Prince went again into the forest, and there"
14716,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"he met once more with the fox, who said:"
14717,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14718,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"""Thou hast now everything in the world thou canst desire, but to"
14719,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"my misfortunes there can be no end, although it is in thy power to"
14720,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"release me from them."""
14721,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14722,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,So he entreated the Prince to shoot him dead and cut off his head and
14723,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,feet.
14724,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14725,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"At last the Prince consented to do so, and scarcely was the deed done"
14726,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"than the fox was changed into a man, who was no other than the brother"
14727,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,"of the beautiful Princess, at last released from the spell that had"
14728,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,bound him.
14729,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,
14730,BY WILHELM AND JAKOB GRIMM,So now nothing was wanting to the happiness of the Prince and his

14746,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14747,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Once upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had three daughters."
14748,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"They lived in a very fine house in a beautiful city, and had many"
14749,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,servants in grand liveries to wait upon them. All their food was
14750,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"served on gold and silver dishes, and their gowns were made of the"
14751,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,richest stuff sewn with jewels.
14752,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14753,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,The two eldest were called Marigold and Dressalinda. Never a day
14754,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"passed but these two went out to some feast or junketing; but Beauty,"
14755,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the youngest, loved to stay at home and keep her old father company."
14756,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14757,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Now, it happened that misfortune came upon the merchant. Ships of"
14758,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,his which were sailing the high seas laden with merchandise of great
14759,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"price, were wrecked, and in one day he found that he was no longer the"
14760,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"richest merchant in the city, but a very poor man."
14761,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14762,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"There was still left to him a little house in the country, and to"
14763,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"this, when everything else had been sold, he retired. His three"
14764,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"daughters, of course, went with him."
14765,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14766,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,Marigold and Dressalinda were very cross to think that they had lost
14767,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"all their money, and after being so rich and sought after, they must"
14768,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,now live in a miserable cottage.
14769,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14770,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"But Beauty's only thought was to cheer her old father, and while her"
14771,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"two sisters sat on wooden chairs and cried and bewailed themselves,"
14772,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beauty lighted the fire and got the supper ready, for the merchant was"
14773,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,now so poor that he could not even keep a servant.
14774,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14775,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,And so it went on. The two eldest sisters would do nothing but sulk in
14776,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"corners, while Beauty swept the floors and washed the dishes, and did"
14777,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,her best to make the poor cottage pleasant. They led their sister a
14778,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"dreadful life too, with their complaints, for not only did they refuse"
14779,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"to do anything themselves, but they said that everything she did was"
14780,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"done wrong. But Beauty bore all their unkindness patiently, for her"
14781,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,father's sake.
14782,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14783,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"In this way a whole year went by, and then one day a letter came for"

14808,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Her father kissed her fondly, and set out."
14809,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14810,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""You silly girl,"" said Marigold, ""you just want our father to think"
14811,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"you are more unselfish than we are--that's what you want! A rose,"
14812,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"indeed!"""
14813,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14814,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Indeed, sister,"" said Beauty, ""that was not the reason. I thought our"
14815,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"father would have enough to do in seeing to the safety of his ship,"
14816,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"without being troubled to do shopping for me."""
14817,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14818,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"But the sisters were very much offended, and went off to sit in their"
14819,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,own room to talk of the fine things they would have when their father
14820,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,came back.
14821,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14822,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"In the meantime the merchant went his way to the city, full of hope"
14823,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,and great plans as to what he would do with his money.
14824,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14825,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"But when he got there, he found that some one had played a trick on"
14826,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"him, and no ship of his had come into harbor, so he was just as badly"
14827,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,off as before.
14828,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14829,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,He spent the whole day looking about to make sure there was no truth
14830,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"in the letter he had received, and it was beginning to get dusk when"
14831,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"he started out, with a sad heart, to make the journey home again. He"
14832,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"was tired and miserable, and he had tasted no food since he left home"
14833,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,in the morning.
14834,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14835,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,It was quite dark by the time he came to the great wood through which
14836,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"he had to pass to get to his cottage, and when he saw a light shining"
14837,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"through the trees, he decided not to go to his home that night, but"
14838,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,to make his way towards the light in the wood and ask for food and
14839,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,shelter.
14840,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14841,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"He expected to find a woodcutter's cottage, but what was his surprise,"
14842,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"as he drew near to the light, to find that it came from the windows of"
14843,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,a large and beautiful palace!
14844,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14845,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"He knocked at the gates, but no one answered, and presently, driven by"
14846,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"hunger and cold, he made bold to enter, and mounted the marble steps"
14847,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,into the great hall.
14848,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14849,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"All the way he never saw a soul. There was a big fire in the hall, and"
14850,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"when he had warmed himself, he set out to look for the master of the"
14851,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"house. But he did not look far, for behind the first door he opened"
14852,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"was a cosy little room with supper set for one, a supper the mere look"
14853,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,of which made you hungry.
14854,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14855,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So the merchant sat down as bold as you please, and made a very hearty"
14856,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"supper, after which he again thought he would look for the master of"
14857,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,the house.
14858,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14859,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"He started off and opened another door, but there he saw a bed, merely"
14860,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"to look at which made you sleepy, so he said to himself:"
14861,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14862,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""This is some fairies' work. I had better not look any farther for the"
14863,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"master of the house."""
14864,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14865,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And with that he tumbled into bed, and, being very tired, he went to"
14866,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"sleep at once, and slept like a top till it was time to get up in the"
14867,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,morning.
14868,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14869,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,When he awoke he was quite surprised to find himself in such a soft
14870,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"and comfortable bed, but presently he remembered all that had happened"
14871,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,to him.
14872,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14873,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""I must be going,"" he said to himself, ""but I wish I could thank my"
14874,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"host for my good rest and my good supper."""
14875,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14876,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,When he got out of bed he found he had something else to be grateful
14877,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"for, for on the chair by the bedside lay a fine suit of new clothes,"
14878,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"marked with his name, and with ten gold pieces in every pocket. He"
14879,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,felt quite a different man when he had put on the suit of blue and
14880,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"silver, and jingled the gold pieces of money in his pockets."
14881,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14882,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"When he went downstairs, he found a good breakfast waiting for him in"
14883,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the little room where he had supped the night before, and when he had"
14884,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"made a good meal, he thought he would go for a stroll in the garden."
14885,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14886,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Down the marble steps he went, and when he came to the garden, he saw"
14887,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"that it was full of roses, red and white and pink and yellow, and the"
14888,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"merchant looked at them, and remembered Beauty's wish."
14889,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14890,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Oh, my poor daughters,"" he said, ""what a disappointment it will be to"
14891,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"them to know that my ship has not come home after all, but Beauty at"
14892,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"any rate can have what she wanted."""
14893,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14894,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,So he stretched out his hand and plucked the biggest red rose within
14895,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,his reach.
14896,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14897,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"As the stalk snapped in his fingers, he started back in terror, for he"
14898,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"heard an angry roar, and the next minute a dreadful Beast sprang upon"
14899,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"him. It was taller than any man, and uglier than any animal, but, what"
14900,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"seemed most dreadful of all to the merchant, it spoke to him with a"
14901,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"man's voice, after it had roared at him with the Beast's."
14902,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14903,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Ungrateful wretch!"" said the Beast. ""Have I not fed you, lodged you,"
14904,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"and clothed you, and now you must repay my hospitality by stealing the"
14905,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"only thing I care for, my roses?"""
14906,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14907,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Mercy! mercy!"" cried the merchant."
14908,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14909,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""No,"" said the Beast, ""you must die!"" The poor merchant fell upon his"
14910,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,knees and tried to think of something to say to soften the heart of
14911,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the cruel Beast; and at last he said, ""Sir, I only stole this rose"
14912,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,because my youngest daughter asked me to bring her one. I did not
14913,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"think, after all you have given me, that you would grudge me a"
14914,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"flower."""
14915,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14916,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Tell me about this daughter of yours,"" said the Beast suddenly. ""Is"
14917,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"she a good girl?"""
14918,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14919,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""The best and dearest in the world,"" said the old merchant. And then"
14920,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"he began to weep, to think that he must die and leave his Beauty alone"
14921,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"in the world, with no one to be kind to her."
14922,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14923,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Oh!"" he cried, ""what will my poor children do without me?"""
14924,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14925,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""You should have thought of that before you stole the rose,"" said the"
14926,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beast. ""However, if one of your daughters loves you well enough"
14927,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"to suffer instead of you, she may. Go back and tell them what has"
14928,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"happened to you, but you must give me your promise that either you,"
14929,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"or one of your daughters, shall be at my palace door in three months'"
14930,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"time from to-day."""
14931,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14932,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,The wretched man promised.
14933,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14934,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""At any rate,"" he thought, ""I shall have three months more of life."""
14935,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14936,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Then the Beast said, ""I will not let you go empty-handed."""
14937,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14938,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So the merchant followed him back into the palace. There, on the floor"
14939,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"of the hall, lay a great and beautiful chest of wrought silver."
14940,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14941,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Fill this with any treasures that take your fancy,"" said the Beast."
14942,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14943,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,And the merchant filled it up with precious things from the Beast's
14944,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,treasure-house.
14945,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14946,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""I will send it home for you,"" said the Beast, shutting down the lid."
14947,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14948,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And so, with a heavy heart, the merchant went away; but as he went"
14949,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"through the palace gate, the Beast called to him that he had forgotten"
14950,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beauty's rose, and at the same time held out to him a large bunch of"
14951,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,the very best.
14952,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14953,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,The merchant put these into Beauty's hand when she ran to meet him at
14954,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,the door of their cottage.
14955,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14956,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Take them, my child,"" he said, ""and cherish them, for they have cost"
14957,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"your poor father his life."""
14958,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14959,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,And with that he sat down and told them the whole story. The two elder
14960,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"sisters wept and wailed, and of course blamed Beauty for all that had"
14961,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,happened.
14962,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14963,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""If it had not been for your wanting a rose, our father would have"
14964,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"left the palace in safety, with his new suit and his gold pieces; but"
14965,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"your foolishness has cost him his life."""
14966,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14967,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""No,"" said Beauty, ""it is _my_ life that shall be sacrificed, for when"
14968,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the three months are over, I shall go to the Beast, and he may kill me"
14969,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"if he will, but he shall never hurt my dear father."""
14970,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14971,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"The father tried hard to persuade her not to go, but she had made"
14972,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"up her mind, and at the end of the three months she set out for the"
14973,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,Beast's palace.
14974,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14975,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Her father went with her, to show her the way. As before, he saw the"
14976,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"lights shining through the wood, knocked and rang in vain at the great"
14977,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"gate, warmed himself at the fire in the big hall, and then found the"
14978,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,little room with the supper on the table that made you hungry to look
14979,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,at. Only this time the table was laid for two.
14980,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14981,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Come, father dear,"" said Beauty, ""take comfort. I do not think the"
14982,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beast means to kill me, or surely he would not have given me such a"
14983,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"good supper."""
14984,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14985,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,But the next moment the Beast came into the room. Beauty screamed and
14986,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,clung to her father.
14987,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14988,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Don't be frightened,"" said the Beast gently, ""but tell me, do you"
14989,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"come here of your own free will?"""
14990,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14991,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Yes,"" said Beauty, trembling."
14992,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14993,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""You are a good girl,"" said the Beast, and then, turning to the old"
14994,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"man, he told him that he might sleep there for that night, but in the"
14995,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,morning he must go and leave his daughter behind him.
14996,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
14997,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"They went to bed and slept soundly, and the next morning the father"
14998,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"departed, weeping bitterly."
14999,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15000,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beauty, left alone, tried not to feel frightened. She ran here and"
15001,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"there through the palace, and found it more beautiful than anything"
15002,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,she had ever imagined.
15003,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15004,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,The most beautiful set of rooms in the palace had written over the
15005,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"doors, ""Beauty's Rooms,"" and in them she found books and music,"
15006,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"canary-birds and Persian cats, and everything that could be thought of"
15007,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,to make the time pass pleasantly.
15008,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15009,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Oh, dear!"" she said; ""if only I could see my poor father I should be"
15010,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"almost happy."""
15011,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15012,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"As she spoke, she happened to look at a big mirror, and in it she saw"
15013,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the form of her father reflected, just riding up to the door of his"
15014,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,cottage.
15015,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15016,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"That night, when Beauty sat down to supper, the Beast came in."
15017,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15018,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""May I have supper with you?"" said he."
15019,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15020,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""That must be as you please,"" said Beauty."
15021,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15022,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So the Beast sat down to supper with her, and when it was finished, he"
15023,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,said:
15024,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15025,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""I am very ugly, Beauty, and I am very stupid, but I love you; will"
15026,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"you marry me?"""
15027,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15028,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""No, Beast,"" said Beauty gently."
15029,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15030,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,The poor Beast sighed and went away.
15031,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15032,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And every night the same thing happened. He ate his supper with her,"
15033,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"and then asked her if she would marry him. And she always said, ""No,"
15034,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Beast."""
15035,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15036,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"All this time she was waited on by invisible hands, as though she had"
15037,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,been a queen. Beautiful music came to her ears without her being able
15038,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"to see the musicians, but the magic looking-glass was best of all, for"
15039,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"in it she could see whatever she wished. As the days went by, and her"
15040,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"slightest wish was granted, almost before she knew what she wanted,"
15041,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"she began to feel that the Beast must love her very dearly, and she"
15042,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"was very sorry to see how sad he looked every night when she said ""No"""
15043,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,to his offer of marriage.
15044,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15045,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"One day, she saw in her mirror that her father was ill, so that night"
15046,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,she said to the Beast:
15047,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15048,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Dear Beast, you are so good to me, will you let me go home to see"
15049,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"my father? He is ill, and he thinks that I am dead. Do let me go and"
15050,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"cheer him up, and I will promise faithfully to return to you."""
15051,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15052,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Very well,"" said the Beast kindly, ""but don't stay away more than"
15053,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"a week, for if you do, I shall die of grief, because I love you so"
15054,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"dearly."""
15055,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15056,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""How shall I reach home?"" said Beauty; ""I do not know the way."""
15057,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15058,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Then the Beast gave her a ring, and told her to put it on her finger"
15059,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"when she went to bed, turn the ruby towards the palm of her hand, and"
15060,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,then she would wake up in her father's cottage. When she wanted to
15061,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"come back, she was to do the same thing."
15062,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15063,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So in the morning, when she awoke, she found herself at her father's"
15064,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"house, and the old man was beside himself with joy to see her safe and"
15065,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,sound.
15066,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15067,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"But her sisters did not welcome her very kindly, and when they heard"
15068,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"how kind the Beast was to her, they envied her her good luck in living"
15069,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"in a beautiful palace, whilst they had to be content with a cottage."
15070,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15071,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""I wish we had gone,"" said Marigold. ""Beauty always gets the best of"
15072,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"everything."""
15073,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15074,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Tell us all about your grand palace,"" said Dressalinda, ""and what you"
15075,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"do, and how you spend your time."""
15076,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15077,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So Beauty, thinking it would amuse them to hear, told them, and their"
15078,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,envy increased day by day. At last Dressalinda said to Marigold:
15079,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15080,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""She has promised to return in a week. If we could only make her"
15081,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"forget the day, the Beast might be angry and kill her, and then there"
15082,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"would be a chance for us."""
15083,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15084,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So on the day before she ought to have gone back, they put, some"
15085,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"poppy juice in a cup of wine which they gave her, and this made her"
15086,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,so sleepy that she slept for two whole days and nights. At the end of
15087,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"that time her sleep grew troubled, and she dreamed that She saw the"
15088,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,Beast lying dead among the roses in the beautiful gardens of his
15089,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,palace; and from this dream she awoke crying bitterly.
15090,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15091,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,Although she did not know that a week and two days had gone by since
15092,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"she left the Beast, yet after that dream she at once turned the ruby"
15093,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"towards her palm, and the next morning there she was, sure enough, in"

15095,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15096,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"She did not know where his rooms in the palace were, but she felt she"
15097,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"could not wait till supper-time before seeing him, so she ran hither"
15098,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"and thither, calling his name. But the palace was empty, and no one"
15099,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,answered her when she called.
15100,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15101,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Then she ran through the gardens, calling his name again and again,"
15102,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,but still there was silence.
15103,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15104,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Oh! what shall I do if I cannot find him?"" she said. ""I shall never"
15105,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"be happy again."""
15106,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15107,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Then she remembered her dream, and ran to the rose garden, and there,"
15108,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"sure enough, beside the basin of the big fountain, lay the poor Beast"
15109,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,without any sign of life in him.
15110,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15111,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,Beauty flung herself on her knees beside him.
15112,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15113,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Oh, dear Beast,"" she cried, ""and are you really dead? Alas! alas!"
15114,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"then I, too, will die, for I cannot live without you."""
15115,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15116,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Immediately the Beast opened his eyes, sighed, and said:"
15117,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15118,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Beauty, will you marry me?"""
15119,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15120,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And Beauty, beside herself with joy when she found that he was still"
15121,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"alive, answered:"
15122,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15123,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Yes, yes, dear Beast, for I love you dearly."""
15124,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15125,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"At these words the rough fur dropped to the ground, and in place of"
15126,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the Beast stood a handsome Prince, dressed in a doublet of white and"
15127,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"silver, like one made ready for a wedding. He knelt at Beauty's feet"
15128,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,and clasped her hands.
15129,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15130,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"""Dear Beauty,"" he said, ""nothing but your love could have disenchanted"
15131,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"me. A wicked fairy turned me into a Beast, and condemned me to remain"
15132,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,one until some fair and good maiden should love me well enough to
15133,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"marry me, in spite of my ugliness and stupidity. Now, dear one, the"
15134,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,enchantment is broken; let us go back to my palace. You will find that
15135,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"all my servants--who, too, have been enchanted, and have waited on you"
15136,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"all this long time with invisible hands--will now become visible."""
15137,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15138,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"So they returned to the palace, which by this time was crowded with"
15139,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"courtiers, eager to kiss the hands of the Prince and his bride. And"
15140,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"the Prince whispered to one of his attendants, who went out, and in a"
15141,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,very little time came back with Beauty's father and sisters.
15142,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15143,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"The sisters were condemned to be changed into statues, and to stand"
15144,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,at the right and left of the palace gates until their hearts should
15145,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"be softened, and they should be sorry for their unkindness to their"
15146,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"sister. But Beauty, happily married to her Prince, went secretly to"
15147,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,the statues every day and wept over them.
15148,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15149,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And by her tears their stony hearts were softened, and they were"
15150,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"changed into flesh and blood again, and were good and kind for the"
15151,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,rest of their lives.
15152,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15153,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And Beauty and the Beast, who was a Beast no more, but a handsome"
15154,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"Prince, lived happily ever after."
15155,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,
15156,ADAPTED BY E. NESBIT,"And indeed I believe they are living happily still, in the beautiful"

15167,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15168,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15169,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"There was once a King who had three sons, and because they were all so"
15170,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"good and so handsome, he could not make up his mind to which of them"
15171,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"to give his kingdom. For he was growing an old man, and began to think"
15172,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,it would soon be time for him to let one of them reign in his stead.
15173,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15174,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"So he determined to set them a task to perform, and whichever should"
15175,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,be the most successful was to have the kingdom as his reward.
15176,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15177,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,It was some time before he could decide what the task should be. But
15178,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,at last he told them that he had a fancy for a very beautiful little
15179,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"dog, and that they were all to set out to find one for him. They were"
15180,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"to have a whole year in which to search, and were all to return to the"
15181,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"castle on the same day, and present the various dogs they had chosen"
15182,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,at the same hour.
15183,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15184,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father's sudden
15185,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"fancy for a little dog, but when they heard that whichever of them"
15186,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,brought back the prettiest little animal was to succeed his father
15187,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"on the throne, they made no further objection, for it gave the two"
15188,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,younger sons a chance they would not otherwise have had of being King.
15189,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15190,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"So they bade their father good-bye, and after agreeing to be back at"
15191,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"the castle at the same hour, and on the same day, when a year should"
15192,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"have passed away, the three brothers all started together."
15193,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15194,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"A great number of lords and servants accompanied them out of the city,"
15195,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"but when they had ridden about a league they sent everyone back, and"
15196,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"after embracing one another affectionately, they all set out to try"
15197,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,their luck in different directions.
15198,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15199,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"The two eldest met with many adventures on their travels, but the"
15200,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,youngest saw the most wonderful sights of all.
15201,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15202,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"He was young and handsome, and as clever as a Prince should be,"
15203,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,besides being brave.
15204,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15205,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Wherever he went he enquired for dogs, and hardly a day passed without"
15206,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"his buying several, big and little, greyhounds, spaniels, lap-dogs,"
15207,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"and sheep-dogs--in fact, every kind of dog that you could think of,"
15208,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,and very soon he had a troop of fifty or sixty trotting along behind
15209,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"him, one of which he thought would surely win the prize."
15210,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15211,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"So he journeyed on from day to day, not knowing where he was going,"
15212,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"until one night he lost his way in a thick dark forest, and after"
15213,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,wandering many weary miles in the wind and rain he was glad to see at
15214,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,last a bright light shining through the trees. He thought he must
15215,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"be near some woodcutter's cottage, but what was his surprise when he"
15216,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,found himself before the gateway of a splendid castle!
15217,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15218,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"At first he hesitated about entering, for his garments were travel"
15219,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"stained, and he was drenched with rain, so that no one could have"
15220,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,possibly taken him for a Prince. All the beautiful little dogs he had
15221,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"taken so much trouble to collect had been lost in the forest, and he"
15222,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,was thoroughly weary and disheartened.
15223,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15224,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"However, something seemed to bid him enter the castle, so he pulled"
15225,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"the bell. Immediately the gateway flew open, and a number of beautiful"
15226,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"white hands appeared, and beckoned to him to cross the courtyard and"
15227,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,enter the great hall.
15228,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15229,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Here he found a splendid fire blazing, beside which stood a"
15230,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"comfortable arm-chair; the hands pointed invitingly towards it, and as"
15231,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,soon as the Prince had seated himself they proceeded to take off his
15232,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"wet, muddy clothes, and dress him in a magnificent suit of silk and"
15233,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,velvet.
15234,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15235,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"When he was ready, the hands led him into a brilliantly-lighted room,"
15236,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,in which was a table spread for supper. At the end of the room was a
15237,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"raised platform, upon which a number of cats were seated, all playing"
15238,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,different musical instruments.
15239,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15240,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"The Prince began to think he must be dreaming, when the door opened,"
15241,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"and a lovely little White Cat came in. She wore a long black veil, and"
15242,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"was accompanied by a number of cats, dressed in black, and carrying"
15243,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,swords.
15244,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15245,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"She came straight up to the Prince, and in a sweet, sad little voice"
15246,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"bade him welcome. Then she ordered supper to be served, and the whole"
15247,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,company sat down together.
15248,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15249,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"They were waited upon by the mysterious hands, but many of the"
15250,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,dishes were not to the Prince's liking. Stewed rats and mice may be a
15251,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"first-rate meal for a cat, but the Prince did not feel inclined to try"
15252,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,them.
15253,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15254,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"However, the White Cat ordered the hands to serve the Prince with the"
15255,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"dishes he liked best, and at once, without his even mentioning his"
15256,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"favorite food, he was supplied with every dainty he could think of."
15257,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15258,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"After the Prince had satisfied his hunger, he noticed that the Cat"
15259,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"wore a bracelet upon her paw, in which was set a miniature of himself;"
15260,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"but when he questioned her about it, she sighed, and seemed so sad"
15261,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"that, like a well-behaved Prince, he said no more about the matter."
15262,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15263,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Soon after supper, the hands conducted him to bed, when he at once"
15264,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"fell fast asleep, and did not awaken until late the next morning."
15265,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"On looking out of his window, he saw that the White Cat and her"
15266,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,attendants were about to start out on a hunting expedition.
15267,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15268,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"As soon as the hands had dressed him in a hunting-suit of green, he"
15269,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,hurried down to join his hostess.
15270,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15271,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"The hands led him up to a wooden horse, and seemed to expect him to"
15272,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"mount. At first the Prince was inclined to be angry, but the White Cat"
15273,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"told him so gently that she had no better steed to offer him, that he"
15274,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"at once mounted, feeling very much ashamed of his ill-humor."
15275,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15276,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"They had an excellent day's sport. The White Cat, who rode a monkey,"
15277,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"proved herself a clever huntress, climbing the tallest trees with the"
15278,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"greatest ease, and without once falling from her steed."
15279,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15280,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and day after day the time"
15281,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,passed so happily away that the Prince forgot all about the little dog
15282,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"he was searching for, and even forgot his own home and his father's"
15283,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,promise.
15284,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15285,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,At length the White Cat reminded him that in three days he must appear
15286,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"at court, and the Prince was terribly upset to think that he had now"
15287,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,no chance of winning his father's kingdom. But the White Cat told him
15288,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"that all would be well, and giving him an acorn, bade him mount the"
15289,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,wooden horse and ride away.
15290,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15291,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"The Prince thought she must be mocking him, but when she held the"
15292,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"acorn to his ear, he heard quite plainly a little dog's bark."
15293,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15294,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"""Inside this acorn,"" she said, ""is the prettiest little dog in the"
15295,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,world. But be sure you do not open the fruit until you are in the
15296,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"King's presence."""
15297,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15298,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15299,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"The Prince thanked her, and having bidden her a sorrowful farewell,"
15300,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,mounted his wooden steed and rode away.
15301,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15302,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Before he reached the castle, he met his two brothers, who made fine"
15303,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"fun of the wooden horse, and also of the big ugly dog which trotted by"
15304,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,his side.
15305,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15306,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,They imagined this to be the one their brother had brought back from
15307,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"his travels, hoping that it would gain the prize."
15308,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15309,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"When they reached the palace, everyone was loud in praise of the two"
15310,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"lovely little dogs the elder brothers had brought back with them, but"
15311,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"when the youngest opened his acorn and showed a tiny dog, lying upon a"
15312,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"white satin cushion, they knew that this must be the prettiest little"
15313,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,dog in the world.
15314,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15315,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"However, the King did not feel inclined to give up his throne just"
15316,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"yet, so he told the brothers that there was one more task they must"
15317,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,first perform: they must bring him a piece of muslin so fine that it
15318,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,would pass through the eye of a needle.
15319,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15320,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,So once more the brothers set out upon their travels. As for the
15321,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"youngest, he mounted his wooden horse and rode straight back to his"
15322,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,dear White Cat.
15323,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15324,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"She was delighted to welcome him, and when the Prince told her that"
15325,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,the King had now ordered him to find a piece of muslin fine enough to
15326,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"go through the eye of a needle, she smiled at him very sweetly, and"
15327,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,told him to be of good cheer.
15328,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15329,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"""In my palace I have some very clever spinners,"" she said; ""and I will"
15330,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"set them to work upon the muslin."""
15331,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15332,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,The Prince had begun to suspect by this time that the White Cat was
15333,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"no ordinary pussy, but whenever he begged her to tell him her history,"
15334,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,she only shook her head mournfully and sighed.
15335,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15336,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Well, the second year passed away as quickly as the first, and the"
15337,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,night before the day on which the three Princes were expected at their
15338,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"father's court, the White Cat gave the young Prince a walnut, telling"
15339,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"him that it contained the muslin. Then she bade him good-by, and he"
15340,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,mounted the wooden horse and rode away.
15341,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15342,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,This time the young Prince was so late that his brothers had already
15343,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,begun to display their pieces of muslin to the King when he arrived
15344,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,at the castle gates. The materials they had brought were of extremely
15345,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"fine texture, and passed easily through the eye of a darning-needle,"
15346,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,but through the small needle the King had provided they would _not_
15347,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,pass. Then the youngest Prince stepped into the great hall and
15348,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"produced his walnut. He cracked it carefully, and found inside"
15349,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"a hazel-nut. This when cracked held a cherrystone, inside the"
15350,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"cherrystone was a grain of wheat, and in the wheat a millet-seed. The"
15351,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"Prince himself began to mistrust the White Cat, but he instantly"
15352,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"felt a cat's claw scratch him gently, so he persevered, opened the"
15353,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"millet-seed, and found inside a beautiful piece of soft white muslin"
15354,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,that was four hundred ells long at the very least. It passed with the
15355,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"greatest ease through the eye of the smallest needle in the kingdom,"
15356,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,and the Prince felt that now the prize must be his.
15357,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,
15358,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,"But the old King was still very loth to give up ruling, so he told the"
15359,BY THE COMTESSE D'AULNOY,Princes that before any one of them could become King he must find

15674,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,A bad-tempered widow had two daughters. The eldest was like her
15675,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"mother, both in feature and disposition, while the youngest resembled"
15676,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"her father. She was sweet-natured always, and as pretty as she was"
15677,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,amiable.
15678,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15679,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"The widow doted on the daughter who was so like herself, but had no"
15680,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"love for the other, whom she compelled to work hard all day, and"
15681,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,to live upon the leavings of her elder sister. Among her other hard
15682,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"tasks, she was obliged to carry water every day from a great distance."
15683,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15684,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"One day when she had just filled her pitcher at the fountain, an old"
15685,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"woman asked to drink from it. ""With all my heart,"" replied the pretty"
15686,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"girl. Glad to show a kindness to one old and infirm, she held the"
15687,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,pitcher while the woman slaked her thirst.
15688,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15689,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"Now, this was not a trembling old peasant, as she appeared, but a"

15693,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"or a jewel."""
15694,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15695,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,When the girl reached home her mother scolded her for her long
15696,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"absence. ""Pardon me for being away so long,"" she sweetly replied. As"
15697,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,she spoke some pearls and diamonds issued from her lips.
15698,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15699,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"""What is this I see, child?"" asked the astonished widow."
15700,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15701,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,The forlorn girl was so happy to be called child by her mother that
15702,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"she eagerly related her experience with the old woman at the fountain,"
15703,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"while, with her words, dropped precious stones and roses. The widow"

15705,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15706,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"""Fanny, wouldst thou have the same gift as thy sister?"" asked she. ""Go"
15707,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,thou to the fountain and fetch water. And if an old woman asks thee
15708,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"for a drink, mind thou treat her civilly."""
15709,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15710,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"The girl refused to perform the menial task, until the widow lost"
15711,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"patience and drove her to it. Finally, she took the silver tankard and"
15712,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,sullenly obeyed. No sooner was she at the fountain than from the wood
15713,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"came a lady most handsomely attired, who asked the haughty girl for a"
15714,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,drink from her pitcher.
15715,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15716,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"""I have not come here to serve you,"" she rudely replied, ""but take the"

15718,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"I am as good as you."""
15719,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,

15724,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15725,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"The girl ran home to her mother, who met her at the door. ""Well,"
15726,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"daughter,"" she said, impatient to hear her speak. When she opened her"
15727,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"mouth, to the mother's horror, two vipers and two toads sprang from"
15728,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"it. ""This is the fault of your wretched sister,"" the unhappy mother"
15729,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"cried. She ran to beat the poor younger sister, who fled to the"
15730,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"forest to escape the cruel blows. When she was past pursuit, she threw"

15733,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"The King's son, returning from the hunt, found her thus, and asked the"

15736,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"""My mother has driven me from my home,"" she told him. She was so"
15737,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,"pretty that he fell in love with her at once, and pressed her to tell"

15741,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,
15742,TOADS AND DIAMONDS,Meanwhile the ugly and selfish sister had made herself so disagreeable

15758,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15759,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15760,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"It is said that in the days of the famed Prince Arthur, who was king"
15761,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"of Britain, in the year 516 there lived a great magician, called"
15762,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that"
15763,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,time.
15764,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15765,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"This great magician, who could assume any form he pleased, was"
15766,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"traveling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very much"
15767,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest plowman to rest"
15768,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"himself, and ask for some refreshment."
15769,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15770,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his wife, who was a very"
15771,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"good-hearted, hospitable woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden"
15772,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"bowl, and some coarse brown bread on a platter."
15773,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15774,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of
15775,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,the plowman and his wife; but he could not help seeing that though
15776,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both"
15777,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,to be sad and much cast down. He therefore questioned them on the
15778,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"cause of their sadness, and learned that they were miserable because"
15779,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,they had no children.
15780,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15781,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The poor woman declared, with tears in her eyes, that she should be"
15782,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,the happiest creature in the world if she had a son; and although he
15783,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"was no bigger than her husband's thumb, she would be satisfied."
15784,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15785,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a
15786,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"man's thumb, that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of"
15787,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the fairies, and ask her to grant the poor woman's wish. The droll"
15788,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,fancy of such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy
15789,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"queen too, greatly, and she promised Merlin that the wish should be"
15790,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"granted. Accordingly, in a short time after, the plowman's wife had a"
15791,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"son, who, wonderful to relate, was not a bit bigger than his father's"
15792,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,thumb.
15793,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15794,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The fairy queen, wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the"
15795,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"world, came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed"
15796,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"admiring him. The queen kissed the child, and giving it the name"
15797,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"of Tom Thumb, sent for some of the fairies, who dressed her little"
15798,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,favorite as she bade them.
15799,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15800,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;"
15801,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His shirt of web by spiders spun;
15802,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,With jacket wove of thistle's down;
15803,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His trousers were of feathers done.
15804,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie"
15805,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,With eyelash from his mother's eye:
15806,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"His shoes were made of mouses' skin,"
15807,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tann'd with the downy hair within."""
15808,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15809,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his father's
15810,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"thumb, which was only of an ordinary size; but as he got older he"
15811,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,became very cunning and full of tricks. When he was old enough to
15812,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"play with the boys, and had lost all his own cherry-stones, he used to"
15813,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"creep into the bags of his playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting"
15814,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"out unseen, would again join in the game."
15815,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15816,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones,"
15817,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"where he had been pilfering as usual, the boy to whom it belonged"
15818,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"chanced to see him. ""Ah, ha! my little Tommy,"" said the boy, ""so I"
15819,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"have caught you stealing my cherry-stones at last, and you shall be"
15820,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"rewarded for your thievish tricks."" On saying this, he drew the string"
15821,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"tight round his neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor"
15822,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"little Tom's legs, thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out"
15823,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"with the pain, and begged to be let out, promising never to be guilty"
15824,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,of such bad practices again.
15825,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15826,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter pudding, and"
15827,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge"
15828,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,of the bowl; but unfortunately his foot slipped and he plumped over
15829,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"head and ears into the batter, unseen by his mother, who stirred him"
15830,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"into the pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil."
15831,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15832,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The batter had filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but,"
15833,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"on feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot,"
15834,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, instantly"
15835,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"pulling it out of the pot, she threw it to the door. A poor tinker,"
15836,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"who was passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his"
15837,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"budget, he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of"
15838,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the batter, he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker"
15839,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,that he flung down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke
15840,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"to pieces by the fall, Tom crept out covered over with the batter, and"
15841,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"with difficulty walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her"
15842,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"darling in such a woful state, put him into a tea-cup, and soon washed"
15843,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"off the batter; after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed."
15844,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15845,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk her"
15846,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was"
15847,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"very high, fearing lest he should be blown away, she tied him to a"
15848,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,thistle with a piece of fine thread. The cow soon saw the oak-leaf
15849,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"hat, and, liking the look of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one"
15850,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,mouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her
15851,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"great teeth, which threatened to crush him to pieces, and he roared"
15852,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"out as loud as he could, ""Mother, mother!"""
15853,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15854,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?"" said his mother."
15855,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15856,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""Here, mother,"" replied he, ""in the cow's mouth."""
15857,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15858,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised"
15859,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out."
15860,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to
15861,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in"
15862,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,her bosom and ran home with him.
15863,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15864,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Tom's father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle
15865,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"with, and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and"
15866,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"rolled into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him"
15867,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"up, and flew with him to the top of a giant's castle that was near the"
15868,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"sea-side, and there left him."
15869,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15870,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom was in a dreadful state, and did not know what to do; but he was"
15871,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,soon more dreadfully frightened; for old Grumbo the giant came up to
15872,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"walk on the terrace, and seeing Tom, he took him up and swallowed him"
15873,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,like a pill.
15874,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15875,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to repent what he
15876,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,hand done; for Tom began to kick and jump about so much that he felt
15877,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"very uncomfortable, and at last threw him up again into the sea. A"
15878,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was"
15879,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"soon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When"
15880,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"they opened the fish in order to cook it, everyone was astonished"
15881,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"at finding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted to be out"
15882,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"again. They carried him to the King, who made Tom his dwarf, and he"
15883,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,soon grew a great favorite at court; for by his tricks and gambols he
15884,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"not only amused the King and Queen, but also all the Knights of the"
15885,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Round Table.
15886,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15887,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"It is said that when the King rode out on horseback, he often took"
15888,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom along with him, and if a shower came on, he used to creep into his"
15889,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Majesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over."
15890,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15891,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if"
15892,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"they were as small as he was, and whether rich or poor. Tom told the"
15893,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,King that his father and mother were as tall as any of the sons about
15894,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"court, but rather poor. On hearing this, the King carried Tom to his"
15895,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"treasury, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to take"
15896,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made the"
15897,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,poor little fellow caper with joy. Tom went immediately to fetch a
15898,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the"
15899,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"treasury, where he got a silver three-penny piece to put into it."
15900,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15901,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back;
15902,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set"
15903,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any accident"
15904,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two"
15905,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,days and two nights he reached his father's house in safety.
15906,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15907,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Tom had traveled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his
15908,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet"
15909,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"him, and carried him into the house."
15910,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15911,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom's parents were both happy to see him, and the more so as he had"
15912,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,brought such an amazing sum of money with him; but the poor little
15913,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"fellow was excessively wearied, having traveled half a mile in"
15914,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"forty-eight hours, with a huge silver threepenny-piece on his back."
15915,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"His mother, in order to recover him, placed him in a walnut shell by"
15916,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the fireside, and feasted him for three days on a hazel-nut, which"
15917,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,made him very sick; for a whole nut used to serve him a month.
15918,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15919,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom was soon well again; but as there had been a fall of rain, and the"
15920,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"ground was very wet, he could not travel back to King Arthur's Court;"
15921,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"therefore his mother, one day when the wind was blowing in that"
15922,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"direction, made a little parasol of cambric paper, and tying Tom"
15923,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"to it, she gave him a puff into the air with her mouth, which soon"
15924,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,carried him to the King's palace.
15925,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15926,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Just at the time when Tom came flying across the courtyard, the cook"
15927,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"happened to be passing with the King's great bowl of porridge, which"
15928,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,was a dish his Majesty was very fond of; but unfortunately the poor
15929,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"little fellow fell plump into the middle of it, and splashed the hot"
15930,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,porridge about the cook's face.
15931,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15932,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The cook, who was an ill-natured fellow, being in a terrible rage at"
15933,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Tom for frightening and scalding him with the porridge, went straight"
15934,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"to the King, and said that Tom had jumped into the royal porridge, and"
15935,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,thrown it down out of mere mischief. The King was so enraged when
15936,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"he heard this, that he ordered Tom to be seized and tried for high"
15937,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"treason; and there being no person who dared to plead for him, he was"
15938,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,condemned to be beheaded immediately.
15939,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15940,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced, poor Tom fell"
15941,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"a-trembling with fear, but, seeing no means of escape, and observing a"
15942,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"miller close to him gaping with his great mouth, as country boobies"
15943,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"do at a fair, he took a leap, and fairly jumped down his throat. This"
15944,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,exploit was done with such activity that not one person present saw
15945,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"it, and even the miller did not know the trick which Tom had played"
15946,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"upon him. Now, as Tom had disappeared, the court broke up, and the"
15947,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,miller went home to his mill.
15948,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15949,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear of the court, and"
15950,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"therefore he began to roll and tumble about, so that the poor miller"
15951,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"could get no rest, thinking he was bewitched; so he sent for a doctor."
15952,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"When the doctor came, Tom began to dance and sing; and the doctor,"
15953,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"being as much frightened as the miller, sent in haste for five other"
15954,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,doctors and twenty learned men.
15955,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15956,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"When they were debating about this extraordinary case, the miller"
15957,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"happened to yawn, when Tom, seizing the chance, made another jump, and"
15958,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,alighted safely upon his feet on the middle of the table.
15959,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15960,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The miller, who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a"
15961,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"little pigmy creature, fell into a terrible rage, and, laying hold"
15962,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"of Tom, ran to the King with him; but his Majesty, being engaged with"
15963,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"state affairs, ordered him to be taken away, and kept in custody till"
15964,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,he sent for him.
15965,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15966,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out of his hands this
15967,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"time, so he put him into a mouse-trap, and left him to peep through"
15968,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the wires. Tom had remained in the trap a whole week, when he was sent"
15969,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"for by King Arthur, who pardoned him for throwing down the porridge,"
15970,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,and took him again into favor. On account of his wonderful feats of
15971,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"activity, Tom was knighted by the King, and went under the name of the"
15972,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,renowned Sir Thomas Thumb. As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the
15973,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"batter-pudding, the porridge, and the insides of the giant, miller,"
15974,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"and fishes, his Majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be"
15975,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,mounted as a knight.
15976,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15977,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,"
15978,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His boots of chicken's hide;
15979,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"And by a nimble fairy blade,"
15980,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Well learned in the tailoring trade,"
15981,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His clothing was supplied--
15982,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,A needle dangled by his side;
15983,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"A dapper mouse he used to ride,"
15984,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!"""
15985,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15986,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress, and mounted"
15987,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"on the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the King and nobility, who"
15988,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,were all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancing
15989,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,charger.
15990,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15991,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"One day, as they were riding by a farmhouse, a large cat, which was"
15992,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"lurking about the door, made a spring, and seized both Tom and his"
15993,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"mouse. She then ran up a tree with them, and was beginning to devour"
15994,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the mouse; but Tom boldly drew his sword, and attacked the cat so"
15995,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"fiercely that she let them both fall, when one of the nobles caught"
15996,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"him in his hat, and laid him on a bed of down, in a little ivory"
15997,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,cabinet.
15998,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
15999,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The queen of the fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit, and"
16000,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"carried him back to Fairyland, where he lived several years. During"
16001,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"his residence there, King Arthur, and all the persons who knew Tom,"
16002,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"had died; and as he was desirous of being again at court, the fairy"
16003,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"queen, after dressing him in a suit of clothes, sent him flying"
16004,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"through the air to the palace, in the days of King Thunstone, the"
16005,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"successor of Arthur. Every one flocked round to see him, and being"
16006,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"carried to the King, he was asked who he was--whence he came--and"
16007,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,where he lived? Tom answered:
16008,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16009,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""My name is Tom Thumb,"
16010,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,From the fairies I've come.
16011,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"When King Arthur shone,"
16012,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His Court was my home.
16013,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"In me he delighted,"
16014,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,By him I was knighted;
16015,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Did you never hear of Sir Thomas Thumb?"""
16016,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16017,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,The King was so charmed with this address that he ordered a little
16018,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"chair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also"
16019,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"a palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in."
16020,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"He also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice."
16021,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16022,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,The Queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir Thomas that she
16023,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"resolved to ruin him, and told the King that the little knight had"
16024,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,been saucy to her.
16025,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16026,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The King sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the"
16027,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he"
16028,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"lay for a long time, until he was almost starved with hunger; but at"
16029,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"last he ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on"
16030,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"the ground, near his hiding-place, he approached very cautiously, and"
16031,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"getting himself placed astride on it, was immediately carried up into"
16032,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,the air. The butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field
16033,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"to field, and at last he returned to the court, where the King and"
16034,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,nobility all strove to catch him; but at last poor Tom fell from his
16035,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"seat into a watering-pot, in which he was almost drowned."
16036,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16037,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"When the Queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be"
16038,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse-trap until the time of his
16039,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,execution.
16040,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16041,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about"
16042,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty."
16043,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16044,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"The King received Tom again into favor, which he did not live to"
16045,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"enjoy, for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew"
16046,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"his sword and fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last"
16047,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,overcame him:
16048,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16049,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""He fell dead on the ground where he stood,"
16050,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"And the spider suck'd every drop of his blood."""
16051,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16052,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their
16053,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"little favorite, that they went into mourning, and raised a fine white"
16054,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"marble monument over his grave, with the following epitaph:"
16055,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,
16056,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"""Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,"
16057,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Who died by a spider's cruel bite.
16058,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"He was well known in Arthur's Court,"
16059,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Where he afforded gallant sport;
16060,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"He rode at tilt and tournament,"
16061,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,And on a mouse a-hunting went.
16062,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,Alive he filled the Court with mirth;
16063,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,His death to sorrow soon gave birth.
16064,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head"
16065,ADAPTED BY ERNEST RHYS,"And cry--Alas! Tom Thumb is dead!"""

16076,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16077,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land's End of"
16078,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"England, in the county of Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son"
16079,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"called Jack. He was brisk and of ready, lively wit, so that nobody or"
16080,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,nothing could worst him.
16081,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16082,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named
16083,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Cormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round"
16084,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the waist, of a fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the"
16085,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,neighboring towns and villages. He lived in a cave in the midst of
16086,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the Mount, and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the"
16087,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"mainland, where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his"
16088,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"way. Everybody at his approach ran out of their houses, while he"
16089,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"seized on their cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen"
16090,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"on his back at a time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie"
16091,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,them round his waist like a bunch of tallow-dips. He had done this
16092,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"for many years, so that all Cornwall was in despair."
16093,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16094,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,One day Jack happened to be at the town hall when the magistrates were
16095,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sitting in council about the giant. He asked, ""What reward will be"
16096,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"given to the man who kills Cormoran?"" ""The giant's treasure,"" they"
16097,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"said, ""will be the reward."" Quoth Jack, ""Then let me undertake it."""
16098,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16099,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in"
16100,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the beginning of a dark winter's evening, when he fell to work, and"
16101,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"before morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as"
16102,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"broad, covering it over with long sticks and straw. Then he strewed a"
16103,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"little mold over it, so that it appeared like plain ground. Jack then"
16104,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"placed himself on the opposite side of the pit, farthest from the"
16105,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"giant's lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put the horn to"
16106,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his mouth, and blew. This noise roused the giant, who rushed from his"
16107,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"cave, crying: ""You incorrigible villain, are you come here to disturb"
16108,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will have, and"
16109,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you for breakfast."""
16110,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled into the pit, and made"
16111,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the very foundations of the Mount to shake. ""Oh Giant,"" quoth Jack,"
16112,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""where are you now? Oh, faith, you are gotten now into a tight place,"
16113,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,where I will surely plague you for your threatening words; what do you
16114,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will no other diet serve
16115,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"you but poor Jack?"" Then having tantalized the giant for a while, he"
16116,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe on the very crown of
16117,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his head, and killed him on the spot."
16118,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16119,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search the cave,"
16120,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,which he found contained much treasure. When the magistrates heard of
16121,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,this they made a declaration he should henceforth be termed:
16122,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16123,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER
16124,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16125,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were written these"
16126,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,words embroidered in letters of gold:
16127,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16128,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Here's the right valiant Cornish man."
16129,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Who slew the giant Cormoran."""
16130,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16131,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"The news of Jack's victory soon spread over all the West of England,"
16132,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"so that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing of it, vowed to be"
16133,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"revenged on Jack, if ever he should light on him. This giant was the"
16134,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,lord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood.
16135,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Now Jack, about four months afterwards, walking near this wood in his"
16136,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"journey to Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain"
16137,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and fell fast asleep. While he was sleeping, the giant, coming there"
16138,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"for water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed Jack the"
16139,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Giant-killer by the lines written on the belt. Without ado, he took"
16140,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack on his shoulders and carried him towards his castle. Now, as they"
16141,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"passed through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack,"
16142,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,who was strangely surprised to find himself in the clutches of the
16143,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant. His terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw"
16144,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the ground strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his own"
16145,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,would ere long be among them. After this the giant locked poor Jack in
16146,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"an immense chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another"
16147,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant, his brother, living in the same wood, who might share in the"
16148,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,meal on Jack.
16149,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16150,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window beheld afar"
16151,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"off the two giants coming towards the castle. ""Now,"" quoth Jack to"
16152,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"himself, ""my death or my deliverance is at hand."""
16153,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16154,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Now, there were strong cords in a corner of the room in which Jack"
16155,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"was, and two of these he took, and made a strong noose at the end; and"
16156,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,while the giants were unlocking the iron gate of the castle he threw
16157,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,the ropes over each of their heads. Then he drew the other ends across
16158,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"a beam, and pulled with all his might, so that he throttled them."
16159,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Then, when he saw they were black in the face, he slid down the rope,"
16160,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and drawing his sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant's keys,"
16161,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and unlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by the hair"
16162,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"of their heads, almost starved to death. ""Sweet ladies,"" quoth Jack,"
16163,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""I have destroyed this monster and his brutish brother, and obtained"
16164,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"your liberty."" This said he presented them with the keys, and so"
16165,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,proceeded on his journey to Wales.
16166,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16167,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack made the best of his way by traveling as fast as he could, but"
16168,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"lost his road, and was benighted, and could find no habitation until,"
16169,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"coming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order"
16170,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,to get shelter took courage to knock at the gate. But what was his
16171,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,surprise when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet
16172,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"he did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh"
16173,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant, and what he did was by private and secret malice under the"
16174,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"false show of friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the"
16175,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant, was shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard"
16176,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,his host in another apartment muttering these words:
16177,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16178,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Though here you lodge with me this night,"
16179,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,You shall not see the morning light:
16180,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"My club shall dash your brains outright!"""
16181,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16182,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Say'st thou so,"" quoth Jack; ""that is like one of your Welsh tricks,"
16183,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"yet I hope to be cunning enough for you."" Then, getting out of bed, he"
16184,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"laid a log in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of"
16185,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the room. At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who"
16186,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"struck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had"
16187,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"broken every bone in Jack's skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in"
16188,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"his sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night's lodging. ""How"
16189,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"have you rested?"" quoth the giant; ""did you not feel anything in the"
16190,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"night?"" ""No,"" quoth Jack, ""nothing but a rat, which gave me two or"
16191,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"three slaps with her tail."" With that, greatly wondering, the giant"
16192,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of"
16193,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"hasty pudding. Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him,"
16194,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack put a large leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that"
16195,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"he could convey the pudding into it without its being perceived. Then,"
16196,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"telling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack"
16197,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"ripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding. Whereupon,"
16198,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"saying, ""Odds splutters her nails, her can do that trick herself,"" the"
16199,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"monster took the knife, and ripping open his belly, fell down dead."
16200,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16201,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur's only son asked his"
16202,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"father to give him a large sum of money, in order that he might go and"
16203,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"seek his fortune in the principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful"
16204,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,lady possessed with seven evil spirits. The King did his best to
16205,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"persuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last gave way and the"
16206,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the other for"
16207,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"himself to ride upon. Now, after several days' travel, he came to a"
16208,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"market-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered"
16209,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"together. The Prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they"
16210,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,had arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the
16211,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,deceased owed when he died. The Prince replied that it was a pity
16212,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"creditors should be so cruel, and said, ""Go bury the dead, and let his"
16213,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"creditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid."""
16214,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"They came, in such great numbers that before night he had only"
16215,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,twopence left for himself.
16216,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16217,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Now Jack the Giant-killer, coming that way, was so taken with the"
16218,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"generosity of the Prince, that he desired to be his servant. This"
16219,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"being agreed upon, the next morning they set forward on their journey"
16220,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"together, when, as they were riding out of the town, an old woman"
16221,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"called after the Prince, saying, ""He has owed me twopence these seven"
16222,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"years; pray pay me as well as the rest."" Putting his hand into his"
16223,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"pocket, the Prince gave the woman all he had left, so that after their"
16224,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"day's food, which cost what small store Jack had by him, they were"
16225,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,without a penny between them.
16226,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16227,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"When the sun got low, the King's son said, ""Jack, since we have no"
16228,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"money, where can we lodge this night?"""
16229,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16230,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"But Jack replied, ""Master, we'll do well enough, for I have an uncle"
16231,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and monstrous giant
16232,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"with three heads; he'll fight five hundred men in armor, and make them"
16233,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"to fly before him."""
16234,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16235,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Alas!"" quoth the Prince, ""what shall we do there? He'll certainly"
16236,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are scarce enough to fill one of his"
16237,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"hollow teeth!"""
16238,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16239,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""It is no matter for that,"" quoth Jack; ""I myself will go before and"
16240,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"prepare the way for you; therefore stop here and wait till I return."""
16241,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack then rode away at full speed, and coming to the gate of the"
16242,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"castle, he knocked so loud that he made the neighboring hills resound."
16243,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"The giant roared out at this like thunder, ""Who's there?"""
16244,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16245,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack answered, ""None but your poor cousin Jack."""
16246,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16247,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Quoth he, ""What news with my poor cousin Jack?"""
16248,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16249,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"He replied, ""Dear uncle, bad news, God willing!"""
16250,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16251,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Prithee,"" quoth the giant, ""what bad news can come to me? I am a"
16252,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five"
16253,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"hundred men in armor, and make them fly like chaff before the wind."""
16254,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16255,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Oh, but,"" quoth Jack, ""here's the King's son a-coming with a thousand"
16256,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"men in armor to kill you and destroy all that you have!"""
16257,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16258,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Oh, cousin Jack,"" said the giant, ""this is bad news indeed! I will"
16259,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"immediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar"
16260,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"me in, and keep the keys until the Prince is gone."" Having secured"
16261,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the giant, Jack fetched his master, when they made themselves heartily"
16262,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,merry whilst the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.
16263,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16264,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of
16265,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"gold and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,"
16266,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,at which time the Prince was pretty well out of the smell of the
16267,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant. Jack then returned, and let the giant out of the vault, who"
16268,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,asked what he should give him for keeping the castle from destruction.
16269,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Why,"" quoth Jack, ""I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together"
16270,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"with the old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed's head."""
16271,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16272,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Quoth the giant: ""You know not what you ask; they are the most"
16273,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"precious things I have. The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will"
16274,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"tell you all you want to know, the sword cuts asunder whatever you"
16275,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"strike, and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness. But you have"
16276,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"been very serviceable to me, therefore take them with all my heart."""
16277,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack thanked his uncle, and then went off with them. He soon overtook"
16278,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,his master and they quickly arrived at the house of the lady the
16279,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Prince sought, who, finding the Prince to be a suitor, prepared a"
16280,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"splendid banquet for him. After the repast was concluded, she told"
16281,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"him she had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with a handkerchief,"
16282,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"saying, ""You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow morning, or"
16283,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"else you will lose your head."" With that she put it in her bosom."
16284,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"The Prince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack's cap of knowledge"
16285,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,informed him how it was to be obtained. In the middle of the night she
16286,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,called upon her familiar spirit to carry her to Lucifer. But Jack put
16287,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"on his coat of darkness and his shoes of swiftness, and was there as"
16288,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"soon as she was. When she entered the place of the demon, she gave the"
16289,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"handkerchief to him, and he laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack took it"
16290,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady next day, and"
16291,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"so saved his life. On that day, she gave the Prince a kiss and told"
16292,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning that she kissed last
16293,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"night, or lose his head."
16294,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16295,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Ah!"" he replied, ""if you kiss none but mine, I will."""
16296,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16297,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""That is neither here nor there,"" said she; ""if you do not, death's"
16298,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"your portion!"""
16299,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16300,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"At midnight she went as before, and was angry with the demon for"
16301,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"letting the handkerchief go. ""But now,"" quoth she, ""I will be too"
16302,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"hard for the King's son, for I will kiss thee and he is to show me thy"
16303,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"lips."" Which she did, and Jack, when she was not standing by, cut off"
16304,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Lucifer's head and, brought it under his invisible coat to his master,"
16305,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,who the next morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady. This
16306,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"broke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her, and she appeared"
16307,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"in all her beauty. They were married the next morning, and soon"
16308,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"after went to the Court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great"
16309,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"exploits, was made one of the Knights of the Round Table."
16310,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16311,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not ridden"
16312,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"far, when he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he beheld a giant"
16313,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"sitting upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side."
16314,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"His goggle eyes were like flames of fire, his countenance grim and"
16315,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"ugly, and his cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon, while"
16316,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the bristles of his beard resembled rods of iron wire, and the locks"
16317,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,that hung down upon his brawny shoulders were like curled snakes or
16318,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"hissing adders. Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat"
16319,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"of darkness, went up close to the giant, and said softly, ""Oh! are you"
16320,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"there? It will not be long before I take you fast by the beard."" The"
16321,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"giant all this while could not see him, on account of his invisible"
16322,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"coat, so that Jack, coming up close to the monster, struck a blow"
16323,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"with his sword at his head, but, missing his aim, he cut off the nose"
16324,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"instead. At this, the giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to"
16325,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"lay about him with his iron club like one stark mad. But Jack, running"
16326,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"behind, drove his sword up to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he"
16327,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"fell down dead. This done, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent"
16328,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"it, with his brother's also, to King Arthur, by a wagoner he hired for"
16329,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,that purpose.
16330,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16331,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his treasure,"
16332,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and, passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came"
16333,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"at length to a large room paved with freestone, at the upper end of"
16334,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"which was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large table, at"
16335,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"which the giant used to dine. Then he came to a window, barred with"
16336,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"iron, through which he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable"
16337,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"captives, who, seeing him, cried out: ""Alas! young man, art thou come"
16338,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"to be one amongst us in this miserable den?"""
16339,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16340,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Ay,"" quoth Jack, ""but pray tell me what is the meaning of your"
16341,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"captivity?"""
16342,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16343,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""We are kept here,"" said one, ""till such time as the giants have a"
16344,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"wish to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered! And many"
16345,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"are the times they have dined upon murdered men!"""
16346,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16347,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Say you so,"" quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the gate and let"
16348,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"them free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon."
16349,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Then searching the giant's coffers, he shared the gold and silver"
16350,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"equally amongst them and took them to a neighboring castle, where they"
16351,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,all feasted and made merry over their deliverance.
16352,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16353,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that
16354,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his"
16355,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"kinsman, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack, and"
16356,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"was within a mile of the castle, the country people flying before him"
16357,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"like chaff. But Jack was not a bit daunted, and said, ""Let him come! I"
16358,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"have a tool to quiet him; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out into"
16359,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the garden, and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell's death and"
16360,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"destruction."""
16361,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16362,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by
16363,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"a moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over which lay a"
16364,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,drawbridge. So Jack employed men to cut through this bridge on
16365,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"both sides, nearly to the middle; and then, dressing himself in"
16366,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"his invisible coat, he marched against the giant with his sword"
16367,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"of sharpness. Although the giant could not see Jack, he smelt his"
16368,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"approach, and cried out in these words:"
16369,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16370,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Fee, fi, fo, fum!"
16371,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,I smell the blood of an Englishman!
16372,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Be he alive or be he dead,"
16373,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"I'll grind his bones to make me bread!"""
16374,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16375,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Say'st thou so,"" said Jack; ""then thou art a monstrous miller"
16376,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"indeed."""
16377,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16378,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"The giant cried out again, ""Art thou that villain who killed my"
16379,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"kinsmen? Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood, and"
16380,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"grind thy bones to powder."""
16381,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16382,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""You'll have to catch me first,"" quoth Jack, and throwing off his"
16383,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"invisible coat, so that the giant might see him, and putting on his"
16384,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"shoes of swiftness, he ran from the giant, who followed like a walking"
16385,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"castle, so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at"
16386,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"every step. Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen and"
16387,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"ladies might see; and at last to end the matter, ran lightly over"
16388,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the drawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursuing him with his club."
16389,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Then, coming to the middle of the bridge, the giant's great weight"
16390,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"broke it down, and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled"
16391,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and wallowed like a whale. Jack, standing by the moat, laughed at"
16392,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"him all the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him scoff, and"
16393,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"plunged from place to place in the moat, yet he could not get out to"
16394,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,be revenged. Jack at length got a cart rope and cast it over the two
16395,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"heads of the giant and drew him ashore by a team of horses, and then"
16396,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"cut off both his heads with his sword of sharpness, and sent them to"
16397,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,King Arthur.
16398,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16399,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking leave of the"
16400,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"knights and ladies, set out for new adventures. Through many woods he"
16401,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"passed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. Here, late"
16402,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"at night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door, which"
16403,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"was opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow. ""Father,"""
16404,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"said Jack, ""can you lodge a benighted traveler that has lost his way?"""
16405,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Yes,"" said the old man; ""you are right welcome to my poor cottage."""
16406,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Whereupon Jack entered, and down they sat together, and the old man"
16407,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"began to speak as follows: ""Son, I see by your belt you are the great"
16408,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"conqueror of giants, and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain"
16409,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"is an enchanted castle; this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and"
16410,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"he, by the help of an old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies"
16411,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"into his castle, where by magic art they are transformed into sundry"
16412,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"shapes and forms. But above all, I grieve for a duke's daughter, whom"
16413,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"they fetched from her father's garden, carrying her through the air in"
16414,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,a burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons. When they secured her within
16415,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the castle, they transformed her into a white hind. And though many"
16416,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"knights have tried to break the enchantment, and work her deliverance,"
16417,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"yet no one could accomplish it, on account of two dreadful griffins"
16418,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,which are placed at the castle gate and which destroy every one who
16419,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"comes near. But you, my son, may pass by them undiscovered, then on"
16420,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,the gates of the castle you will find engraven in large letters how
16421,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the spell may be broken."" Jack gave the old man his hand, and promised"
16422,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,that in the morning he would venture his life to free the lady.
16423,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16424,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap
16425,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"and shoes, and prepared himself for the fray. Now, when he had reached"
16426,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"the top of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins, but"
16427,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"passed them without fear, because of his invisible coat. When he"
16428,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"had got beyond them, he found upon the gates of the castle a golden"
16429,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"trumpet hung by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:"
16430,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16431,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"""Whoever shall this trumpet blow,"
16432,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Shall soon the giant overthrow,"
16433,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,And break the black enchantment straight;
16434,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"So all shall be in happy state."""
16435,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,
16436,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at which the"
16437,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"castle trembled to its vast foundations, and the giant and conjurer"
16438,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"were in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair,"
16439,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,knowing their wicked reign was at an end. Then the giant stooping to
16440,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"take up his club, Jack at one blow cut off his head; whereupon the"
16441,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"conjurer, mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind."
16442,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Then the enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who"
16443,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,had so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their
16444,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"proper shapes, and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. This"
16445,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"being done, the head of Galligantua was likewise, in the usual manner,"
16446,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"conveyed to the Court of King Arthur, where, the very next day,"
16447,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Jack followed, with the knights and ladies who had been delivered."
16448,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Whereupon, as a reward for his good services, the King prevailed upon"
16449,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,the duke to bestow his daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married
16450,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"they were, and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding."
16451,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"Furthermore, the King bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a very"
16452,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER,"beautiful estate thereto belonging, where he and his lady lived in"

16465,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16466,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter,"
16467,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,and she was courted by a gentleman. Every evening he used to come and
16468,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"see her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the daughter used"
16469,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,to be sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for supper. So one
16470,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"evening she had gone down to draw the beer, and she happened to look"
16471,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"up at the ceiling while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck"
16472,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"in one of the beams. It must have been there a long, long time,"
16473,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"but somehow or other she had never noticed it before, and she began"
16474,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,a-thinking. And she thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet
16475,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"there, for she said to herself: ""Suppose him and me was to be married,"
16476,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and we was to have a son, and he was to grow up to be a man, and come"
16477,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"down into the cellar to draw the beer, like as I'm doing now, and the"
16478,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it"
16479,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"would be!"" And she put down the candle and the jug, and sat herself"
16480,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,down and began a-crying.
16481,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16482,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long"
16483,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she"
16484,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over the"
16485,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"floor. ""Why, whatever is the matter?"" said her mother. ""Oh, mother!"""
16486,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"says she, ""look at that horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be married,"
16487,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down to"
16488,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head"
16489,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!"" ""Dear, dear! what"
16490,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"a dreadful thing it would be!"" said the mother, and she sat her down"
16491,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,beside the daughter and started crying too. Then after a bit the
16492,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"father began to wonder that they didn't come back, and he went down"
16493,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"into the cellar to look after them himself, and there they two sat"
16494,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"crying, and the beer running all over the floor. ""Whatever is the"
16495,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"matter?"" says he. ""Why,"" says the mother, ""look at that horrid mallet."
16496,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Just suppose, if our daughter and her sweetheart was to be married,"
16497,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down"
16498,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"into the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his"
16499,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!"" ""Dear, dear,"
16500,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"dear! so it would!"" said the father, and he sat himself down aside of"
16501,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the other two, and started a-crying."
16502,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16503,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself,"
16504,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what they were"
16505,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"after; and there they three sat crying side by side, and the beer"
16506,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,running all over the floor. And he ran straight and turned the tap.
16507,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Then he said: ""Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and"
16508,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"letting the beer run all over the floor?"" ""Oh!"" says the father, ""look"
16509,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"at that horrid mallet! Suppose you and our daughter was to be married,"
16510,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down"
16511,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"into the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on"
16512,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his head and kill him!"" And then they all started crying worse than"
16513,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"before. But the gentleman burst out laughing, and reached up and"
16514,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"pulled out the mallet, and then he said: ""I've traveled many miles,"
16515,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,and I never met three such big sillies as you three before; and now I
16516,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"shall start out on my travels again, and when I can find three bigger"
16517,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sillies than you three, then I'll come back and marry your daughter."""
16518,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"So he wished them good-by, and started off on his travels, and left"
16519,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,them all crying because the girl had lost her sweetheart.
16520,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16521,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Well, he set out, and he traveled a long way, and at last he came to a"
16522,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And the woman
16523,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and the"
16524,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked the woman what she was
16525,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"doing. ""Why, lookye,"" she said, ""look at all that beautiful grass. I'm"
16526,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it. She'll be quite safe,"
16527,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"for I shall tie a string round her neck, and pass it down the chimney,"
16528,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and tie it to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can't fall off"
16529,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"without my knowing it."" ""Oh, you poor silly!"" said the gentleman,"
16530,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""you should cut the grass and throw it down to the cow!"" But the woman"
16531,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,thought it was easier to get the cow up the ladder than to get the
16532,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"grass down, so she pushed her and coaxed her and got her up, and tied"
16533,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"a string round her neck, and passed it down the chimney, and fastened"
16534,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"it to her own wrist. And the gentleman went on his way, but he hadn't"
16535,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"gone far when the cow tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string"
16536,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"tied round her neck, and it strangled her. And the weight of the cow"
16537,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"tied to her wrist pulled the woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast"
16538,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,halfway and was smothered in the soot.
16539,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16540,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Well, that was one big silly."
16541,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16542,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the"
16543,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in"
16544,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"a double-bedded room, and another traveler was to sleep in the other"
16545,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"bed. The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got very"
16546,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"friendly together; but in the morning, when they were both getting up,"
16547,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,the gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the
16548,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,knobs of the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump
16549,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"into them, and he tried over and over again, and couldn't manage it;"
16550,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,and the gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for. At last he
16551,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. ""Oh dear,"" he says,"
16552,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""I do think trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever"
16553,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,were. I can't think who could have invented such things. It takes me
16554,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the best part of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so"
16555,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"hot! How do you manage yours?"" So the gentleman burst out laughing,"
16556,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,and showed him how to put them on; and he was very much obliged to
16557,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"him, and said he never should have thought of doing it that way."
16558,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16559,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,So that was another big silly.
16560,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16561,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a
16562,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"village, and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond"
16563,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"was a crowd of people. And they had rakes, and brooms, and pitchforks,"
16564,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,reaching into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was the matter.
16565,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""Why,"" they say, ""matter enough! Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we"
16566,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"can't rake her out anyhow!"" So the gentleman burst out laughing, and"
16567,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"told them to look up into the sky, and that it was only the shadow in"
16568,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the water. But they wouldn't listen to him, and abused him shamefully"
16569,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,and he got away as quick as he could.
16570,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16571,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,So there were a whole lot of sillies bigger than the three sillies at
16572,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,home. So the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmer's
16573,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever after, that's nothing"
16574,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,to do with you or me.

16590,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"O'Toole--well, well, but the darkness of mankind is untellable! Well,"
16591,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sir, you must know, as you didn't hear it afore, that there was a"
16592,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"King, called King O'Toole, who was a fine old King in the old ancient"
16593,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"times, long ago; and it was he that owned the churches in the early"
16594,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"days. The King, you see was the right sort; he was the real boy, and"
16595,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"loved sport as he loved his life, and hunting in particular; and from"
16596,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the rising o' the sun, up he got, and away he went over the mountains"
16597,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,after the deer; and fine times they were.
16598,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16599,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the King had his health; but,"
16600,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"you see, in the course of time the King grew old, by raison he was"
16601,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"stiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart"
16602,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"failed him, and he was lost entirely for want o' diversion, because he"
16603,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"couldn't go a-hunting no longer; and, by dad the poor King was obliged"
16604,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"at last to get a goose to divert him. Oh, you may laugh, if you like,"
16605,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,but it's truth I'm telling you; and the way the goose diverted him was
16606,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"this-a-way: You see, the goose used to swim across the lake, and go"
16607,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"diving for trout, and catch fish on a Friday for the King, and flew"
16608,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"every other day round about the lake, diverting the poor King. All"
16609,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got stricken in years"
16610,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"like her master, and couldn't divert him no longer, and then it was"
16611,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,that the poor King was lost entirely. The King was walkin' one mornin'
16612,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"by the edge of the lake, lamentin' his cruel fate, and thinking of"
16613,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"drowning himself, that could get no diversion in life, when all of"
16614,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"a sudden, turning round the corner, whom should he meet but a mighty"
16615,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,decent young man coming up to him.
16616,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16617,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""God save you,"" says the King to the young man."
16618,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16619,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""God save you kindly, King O'Toole,"" says the young man."
16620,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,

16627,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough--the saint himself in"

16629,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"than that. May I make bold to ask how is your goose, King O'Toole?"""
16630,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,says he.
16631,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
16632,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""Blur-an-agers, how came ye to know about my goose?"" says the King."

16654,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"waddling up to the poor cripple, her master, and as like him as two"

16764,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"Lucifer, and no king or prince would she agree to marry. Her father"
16765,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"was tired out at last, and invited every king, and prince, and duke,"
16766,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,and earl that he knew or didn't know to come to his court to give her
16767,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"one trial more. They all came, and next day after breakfast they stood"
16768,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"in a row in the lawn, and the Princess walked along in the front of"

16775,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,he had nothing remarkable but a ring of brown curling hair under his

16779,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"So all went away, and the King was so vexed, he said to her, ""Now"

16785,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16786,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"When the song was over, the hall-door was opened, the singer asked in,"

16791,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16792,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"Off he led her, and dismal enough she was. The only thing that gave"
16793,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,her relief was the tones of her husband's voice and his genteel
16794,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"manners. ""Whose wood is this?"" said she, as they were going through"
16795,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"one. ""It belongs to the King you called Whiskers yesterday."" He gave"

16797,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"city. ""Ah, what a fool I was!"" said she to herself. ""He was a fine"
16798,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"man, and I might have him for a husband."" At last they were coming up"
16799,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"to a poor cabin. ""Why are you bringing me here?"" says the poor lady."
16800,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"""This was my house,"" said he, ""and now it's yours."" She began to cry,"
16801,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"but she was tired and hungry, and she went in with him."
16802,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16803,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"Ovoch! there was neither a table laid out, nor a fire burning, and she"
16804,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"was obliged to help her husband to light it, and boil their dinner,"
16805,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,and clean up the place after; and next day he made her put on a stuff
16806,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"gown and a cotton handkerchief. When she had her house readied up, and"
16807,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"no business to keep her employed, he brought home sallies [willows],"
16808,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"peeled them, and showed her how to make baskets. But the hard twigs"
16809,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"bruised her delicate fingers, and she began to cry. Well, then he"
16810,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"asked her to mend their clothes, but the needle drew blood from her"
16811,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"fingers, and she cried again. He couldn't bear to see her tears, so"
16812,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"he bought a creel of earthenware, and sent her to the market to sell"
16813,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"them. This was the hardest trial of all, but she looked so handsome"
16814,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"and sorrowful, and had such a nice air about her, that all her pans,"
16815,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"and jugs, and plates, and dishes were gone before noon, and the only"
16816,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,mark of her old pride she showed was a slap she gave a buckeen across
16817,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,the face when he axed her an impudent question.
16818,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16819,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"Well, her husband was so glad, he sent her with another creel the next"
16820,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"day; but, faith! her luck was after deserting her. A drunken huntsman"
16821,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"came up riding, and his beast got in among her ware, and made _brishe_"
16822,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"of every mother's son of 'em. She went home cryin', and her husband"
16823,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"wasn't at all pleased. ""I see,"" said he, ""you're not fit for business."
16824,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"Come along, I'll get you a kitchen-maid's place in the palace. I know"
16825,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"the cook."""
16826,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16827,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,So the poor thing was obliged to stifle her pride once more. She was
16828,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"kept very busy, and the footman and the butler would be very impudent"
16829,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"about looking for a kiss, but she let a screech out of her the first"
16830,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"attempt was made, and the cook gave the fellow such a lambasting with"
16831,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,the besom that he made no second offer. She went home to her husband
16832,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"every night, and she carried broken victuals wrapped in papers in her"
16833,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,side pockets.
16834,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,
16835,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,A week after she got service there was great bustle in the kitchen.
16836,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"The King was going to be married, but no one knew who the bride was to"
16837,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"be. Well, in the evening the cook filled the Princess's pockets with"
16838,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"cold meat and puddens, and, says she, ""Before you go, let us have a"
16839,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"look at the great doings in the big parlor."" So they came near the"
16840,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"door to get a peep, and who should come out but the King himself, as"
16841,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"handsome as you please, and no other but King Whiskers himself. ""Your"
16842,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"handsome helper must pay for her peeping,"" said he to the cook, ""and"
16843,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"dance a jig with me."" Whether she would or no, he held her hand and"
16844,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"brought her into the parlor. The fiddlers struck up, and away went"
16845,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,_him_ with _her_. But they hadn't danced two steps when the meat and
16846,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"the puddens flew out of her pockets. Every one roared out, and she"
16847,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"flew to the door, crying piteously. But she was soon caught by the"
16848,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"King, and taken into the back parlor. ""Don't you know me, my darling?"""
16849,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"said he. ""I'm both King Whiskers, your husband the ballad-singer, and"
16850,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,the drunken huntsman. Your father knew me well enough when he gave you
16851,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"to me, and all was to drive your pride out of you."" Well, she didn't"
16852,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"know how she was, with fright, and shame, and joy. Love was uppermost,"
16853,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"anyhow, for she laid her head on her husband's breast and cried like a"
16854,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,child. The maids-of-honor soon had her away and dressed her as fine as
16855,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"hands and pins could do it; and there were her mother and father, too."
16856,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,While the company were wondering what would be the end of the handsome
16857,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"girl and the King, he and his Queen, _who_ they didn't know in her"
16858,ADAPTED BY PATRICK KENNEDY,"fine clothes, came in, and such rejoicings and fine doings as there"

16871,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,A poor woman had three sons. The eldest and second eldest were
16872,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"cunning, clever fellows, but they called the youngest Jack the Fool,"
16873,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,because they thought he was no better than a simpleton. The eldest got
16874,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"tired of staying at home, and said he'd go look for service. He stayed"
16875,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"away a whole year, and then came back one day, dragging one foot after"
16876,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the other, and a poor, wizened face on him, and he was as cross as two"
16877,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sticks. When he was rested and had got something to eat, he told"

16879,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Mischance, and that the agreement was whoever would first say he was"

16881,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"from shoulder to hips, taken off. If it was the master, he should also"

16896,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,All the poor mother could say didn't prevent Jack the Fool from

17346,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"But the Brown Lake was far, the road was dusty, Hudden and Dudden"

17666,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,THERE was once upon a time ...
17667,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17668,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""A king!"" my little readers will instantly exclaim."
17669,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17670,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"No, children, you are wrong. There was once upon a time a piece of"
17671,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,wood.
17672,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17673,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,This wood was not valuable; it was only a common log like those that
17674,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,are burnt in winter in the stoves and fireplaces to make a cheerful
17675,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,blaze and warm the rooms.
17676,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17677,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"I cannot say how it came about, but the fact is, that one fine day"
17678,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,this piece of wood was lying in the shop of an old carpenter of the
17679,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"name of Master Antonio. He was, however, called by everybody Master"
17680,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"Cherry, on account of the end of his nose, which was always as red and"
17681,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,polished as a ripe cherry.
17682,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17683,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,No sooner had Master Cherry set his eyes on the piece of wood than
17684,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"his face beamed with delight; and, rubbing his hands together with"
17685,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"satisfaction, he said softly to himself:"
17686,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17687,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""This wood has come at the right moment; it will just do to make the"
17688,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"leg of a little table."""
17689,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17690,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,Having said this he immediately took a sharp axe with which to remove
17691,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"the bark and the rough surface. Just, however, as he was going to give"
17692,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"the first stroke he remained with his arm suspended in the air, for"
17693,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"he heard a very small voice saying imploringly: ""Do not strike me so"
17694,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"hard!"""
17695,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17696,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,Picture to yourselves the astonishment of good old Master Cherry!
17697,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17698,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,He turned his terrified eyes all around the room to try and discover
17699,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"where the little voice could possibly have come from, but he saw"
17700,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,nobody! He looked under the bench--nobody; he looked into a cupboard
17701,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,that was always shut--nobody; he looked into a basket of shavings and
17702,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,sawdust--nobody; he even opened the door of the shop and gave a glance
17703,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"into the street--and still nobody. Who, then, could it be?"
17704,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17705,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""I see how it is;"" he said, laughing and scratching his wig;"
17706,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""evidently that little voice was all my imagination. Let us set to"
17707,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"work again."""
17708,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17709,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,And taking up the axe he struck a tremendous blow on the piece of
17710,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,wood.
17711,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17712,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""Oh! oh! you have hurt me!"" cried the same little voice dolefully."
17713,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17714,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,This time Master Cherry was petrified. His eyes started out of his
17715,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"head with fright, his mouth remained open, and his tongue hung out"
17716,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,almost to the end of his chin like a mask on a fountain. As soon as he
17717,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"had recovered the use of his speech, he began to say, stuttering and"
17718,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,trembling with fear:
17719,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17720,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""But where on earth can that little voice have come from that said"
17721,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,'Oh! oh!?'... Here there is certainly not a living soul. Is it
17722,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,possible that this piece of wood can have learnt to cry and to lament
17723,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,like a child? I cannot believe it. This piece of wood here it is; a
17724,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"log for fuel like all others, and thrown on the fire it would about"
17725,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,suffice to boil a saucepan of beans.... How then? Can anyone be hidden
17726,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"inside it? If anyone is hidden inside, so much the worse for him. I"
17727,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"will settle him at once."""
17728,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17729,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,So saying he seized the poor piece of wood and commenced beating it
17730,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,without mercy against the walls of the room.
17731,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17732,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,Then he stopped to listen if he could hear any little voice
17733,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,lamenting. He waited two minutes--nothing; five minutes-nothing; ten
17734,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,minutes--still nothing!
17735,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17736,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""I see how it is,"" he then said, forcing himself to laugh and pushing"
17737,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"up his wig; ""evidently, the little voice that said 'Oh! oh!' was all"
17738,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"my imagination! Let us to work again."""
17739,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17740,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,But all the same he was in a great fright; he tried to sing to give
17741,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,himself a little courage.
17742,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17743,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,Putting the axe aside he took his plane to plane and polish the bit
17744,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,of wood; but whilst he was running it up and down he heard the same
17745,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"little voice say, laughing:"
17746,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17747,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"""Have done! you are tickling me all over!"""
17748,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17749,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,This time poor Master Cherry fell down as if he had been struck by
17750,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,lightning. When he at last opened his eyes he found himself seated on
17751,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,the floor.
17752,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,
17753,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"His face was quite changed; even the end of his nose, instead of being"
17754,MASTER CHERRY FINDS A QUEER PIECE OF WOOD,"crimson, as it was nearly always, had become blue from fright."

17766,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,
17767,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,A lively little old man immediately walked into the shop. His name was
17768,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"Geppetto, but when the boys in the neighborhood wished to put him in"
17769,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"a passion they called him by the nickname of Polendina, because his"
17770,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,yellow wig greatly resembled a pudding made of Indian corn.
17771,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,
17772,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,Geppetto was very fiery. Woe to him who called him Polendina! He
17773,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"became furious, and there was no holding him."
17774,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,
17775,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"""Good day, Master Antonio,"" said Geppetto; ""what are you doing there"

17787,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"""Here I am ready to serve you,"" replied the carpenter getting on his"

17825,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,
17826,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,When the fight was over Master Antonio was in possession of Geppetto's
17827,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,"yellow wig, and Geppetto discovered that the gray wig belonging to the"

17845,GEPPETTO PLANS A WONDERFUL PUPPET,wriggling violently out of his hands struck with all its force against

17894,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17895,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,Geppetto lived in a small ground-floor room that was only lighted from
17896,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"the staircase. The furniture could not have been simpler--a bad chair,"
17897,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"a poor bed, and a broken-down table. At the end of the room there was"
17898,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"a fireplace with a lighted fire; but the fire was painted, and by the"
17899,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"fire was painted a saucepan that was boiling cheerfully, and sending"
17900,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,out a cloud of smoke that looked exactly like real smoke.
17901,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17902,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,As soon as he reached home Geppetto took his tools and set to work to

17904,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17905,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""What name shall I give him?"" he said to himself; ""I think I will call"
17906,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,him Pinocchio. It is a name that will bring him luck. I once knew a

17908,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"the mother, and Pinocchi the children, and all of them did well. The"
17909,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"richest of them was a beggar."""
17910,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17911,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"Having found a name for his puppet he began to work in good earnest,"
17912,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"and he first made his hair, then his forehead and then his eyes."
17913,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17914,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"The eyes being finished, imagine his astonishment when he perceived"

17917,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"Geppetto seeing himself stared at by those two wooden eyes, took it"
17918,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"almost in bad part, and said in an angry voice:"

17921,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17922,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,No one answered.
17923,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17924,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,Then he proceeded to carve the nose; but no sooner had he made it
17925,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"than it began to grow. And it grew, and grew, and grew until in a few"
17926,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,minutes it had become an immense nose that seemed as if it would never

17928,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17929,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,Poor Geppetto tired himself out with cutting it off. But the more he
17930,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"cut and shortened it, the longer did that impertinent nose become!"
17931,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17932,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,The mouth was not even completed when it began to laugh and deride

17934,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17935,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""Stop laughing!"" said Geppetto provoked; but he might as well have"

17938,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""Stop laughing, I say!"" he roared in a threatening tone."
17939,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17940,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"The mouth then ceased laughing, but put out its tongue as far as it"

17943,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"Geppetto, not to spoil his handiwork, pretended not to see, and"
17944,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"continued his labors. After the mouth he fashioned the chin, then the"

17946,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17947,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,The hands were scarcely finished when Geppetto felt his wig snatched
17948,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"from his head. He turned round, and what did he see? He saw his yellow"
17949,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,wig in the puppet's hand.
17950,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17951,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""Pinocchio!... Give me back my wig instantly!"""
17952,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17953,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"But Pinocchio instead of returning it, put it on his own head, and was"
17954,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,in consequence nearly smothered.
17955,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17956,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,Geppetto at this insolent and derisive behavior felt sadder and more
17957,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,melancholy than he had ever been in his life before; and turning to
17958,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,Pinocchio he said to him:
17959,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17960,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""You young rascal! You are not yet completed, and you are already"
17961,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"beginning to show want of respect to your father! That is bad, my boy,"
17962,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"very bad."""
17963,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17964,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,And he dried a tear.
17965,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17966,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,The legs and feet remained to be done.
17967,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17968,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,When Geppetto had finished the feet he received a kick on the point of
17969,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,the nose.
17970,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17971,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"""I deserve it!"" he said to himself; ""I should have thought of it"

17973,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17974,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,He then took the puppet under the arms and placed him on the floor to
17975,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,teach him to walk.
17976,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17977,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"Pinocchio's legs were stiff and he could not move, but Geppetto led"
17978,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,him by the hand and showed him how to put one foot before the other.
17979,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,
17980,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,When his legs became flexible Pinocchio began to walk by himself and
17981,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"to run about the room; until, having gone out of the house door, he"
17982,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,jumped into the street and escaped.

17984,THE PUPPET IS NAMED PINOCCHIO,"Poor Geppetto rushed after him but was not able to overtake him, for"

18136,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18137,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,At this call two wooden gendarmes immediately appeared. They were very
18138,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"long and very thin and had on cocked hats, and held unsheathed swords"
18139,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,in their hands.
18140,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18141,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,The showman said to them in a hoarse voice:
18142,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18143,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""Take Harlequin, bind him securely, and then throw him on the fire to"

18145,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18146,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,Only imagine that poor Harlequin! His terror was so great that his
18147,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"legs bent under him, and he fell with his face on the ground."
18148,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18149,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"At this agonizing sight Pinocchio, weeping bitterly, threw himself at"
18150,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"the showman's feet, and bathing his long beard with his tears he began"
18151,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,to say in a supplicating voice:
18152,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18153,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""Have pity, Sir Fire-eater!"""
18154,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18155,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""Here there are no sirs,"" the showman answered severely."

18166,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18167,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"Upon hearing himself called Excellence the showman began to smile,"
18168,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,and became at once kinder and more tractable. Turning to Pinocchio he
18169,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,asked:
18170,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18171,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""Well, what do you want from me?"""

18182,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"Harlequin, my true friend, should die for me!"""

18187,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18188,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"Fire-eater at first remained as hard and unmoved as ice, but little by"
18189,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,little he began to melt and to sneeze. And having sneezed four or five

18191,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,

18195,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,beard he deposited a hearty kiss on the point of his nose.
18196,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18197,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""Then the pardon is granted?"" asked poor Harlequin in a faint voice"
18198,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,that was scarcely audible.
18199,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,
18200,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""The pardon is granted!"" answered Fire-eater. He then added, sighing"

18203,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,"""I must have patience! To-night I shall have to resign myself to eat"

18208,FIRE-EATER SNEEZES AND PARDONS PINOCCHIO,they began to leap and to dance merrily. At dawn they were still

18217,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,The following day Fire-eater called Pinocchio to one side and asked
18218,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,him:
18219,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18220,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""What is your father's name?"""
18221,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18222,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Geppetto."""
18223,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18224,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""And what trade does he follow?"""
18225,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18226,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""He is a beggar."""
18227,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18228,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Does he gain much?"""
18229,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18230,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Gain much? Why, he has never a penny in his pocket. Only think, to"
18231,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"buy a spelling-book for me to go to school, he was obliged to sell the"
18232,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,only coat he had to wear--a coat that between patches and darns was
18233,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"not fit to be seen."""
18234,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18235,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Poor devil! I feel almost sorry for him! Here are five gold pieces."
18236,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"Go at once and take them to him with my compliments."""
18237,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18238,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,You can easily understand that Pinocchio thanked the showman a
18239,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,thousand times. He embraced all the puppets of the company one by
18240,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"one, even to the gendarmes, and beside himself with delight set out to"
18241,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,return home.
18242,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18243,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,But he had not gone far when he met on the road a Fox lame in one
18244,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"foot, and a Cat blind in both eyes, who were going along helping each"
18245,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,other like good companions in misfortune. The Fox who was lame walked
18246,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"leaning on the Cat, and the Cat who was blind was guided by the Fox."
18247,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18248,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Good day, Pinocchio,"" said the Fox, accosting him politely."
18249,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18250,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""How do you come to know my name?"" asked the puppet."
18251,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18252,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""I know your father well."""

18258,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""And what was he doing?"""
18259,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18260,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""He was in his shirt sleeves and shivering with cold."""

18262,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Poor papa! But that is over; for the future he shall shiver no more."""
18263,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18264,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Why?"""
18265,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18266,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Because I am become a gentleman."""
18267,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18268,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""A gentleman--you!"" said the Fox, and he began to laugh rudely and"
18269,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"scornfully. The Cat also began to laugh, but to conceal it she combed"
18270,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,her whiskers with her forepaws.
18271,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18272,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""There is little to laugh at,"" cried Pinocchio angrily. ""I am really"
18273,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"sorry to make your mouths water, but if you know anything about it,"
18274,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"you can see that here are five gold pieces."""
18275,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18276,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,And he pulled out the money that Fire-eater had made him a present of.
18277,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18278,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,At the sympathetic ring of the money the Fox with an involuntary
18279,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"movement stretched out the paw that had seemed crippled, and the cat"
18280,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,opened wide two eyes that looked like two green lanterns. It is true
18281,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"that she shut them again, and so quickly that Pinocchio observed"
18282,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,nothing.
18283,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18284,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""And now,"" asked the Fox, ""what are you going to do with all that"

18286,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18287,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""First of all,"" answered the Puppet, ""I intend to buy a new coat for"
18288,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"my papa, made of gold and silver, and with diamond buttons, and then I"
18289,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"will buy a spelling-book for myself."""
18290,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18291,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""For yourself?"""
18292,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18293,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Yes, indeed, for I wish to go to school to study in earnest."""
18294,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18295,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Look at me!"" said the Fox. ""Through my foolish passion for study I"
18296,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"have lost a leg."""
18297,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18298,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Look at me!"" said the Cat. ""Through my foolish passion for study I"
18299,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"have lost the sight of both my eyes."""
18300,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18301,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"At that moment a white Blackbird, that was perched on the hedge by the"
18302,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"road, began his usual song, and said:"
18303,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18304,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Pinocchio, don't listen to the advice of bad companions; if you do"
18305,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"you will repent it!"""
18306,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18307,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,Poor Blackbird! If only he had not spoken! The Cat with a great leap
18308,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"sprang upon him and without even giving him time to say ""Oh!"" ate him"
18309,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"in a mouthful, feathers and all."
18310,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18311,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,Having eaten him and cleaned her mouth she shut her eyes again and
18312,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,feigned blindness as before.
18313,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18314,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Poor Blackbird!"" said Pinocchio to the Cat. ""Why did you treat him so"
18315,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"badly?"""
18316,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18317,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""I did it to give him a lesson. He will learn another time not to"
18318,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"meddle in other people's conversation."""
18319,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18320,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"They had gone almost half-way when the Fox, halting suddenly, said to"
18321,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,the puppet:

18323,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Would you like to double your money?"""
18324,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18325,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""In what way?"""
18326,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18327,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Would you like to make out of your five miserable gold pieces, a"

18329,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18330,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""I should think so! But in what way?"""
18331,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18332,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""The way is easy enough. Instead of returning home you must go with"

18334,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18335,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""And where do you wish to take me?"""
18336,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18337,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""To the Land of the Owls."""
18338,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18339,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"Pinocchio reflected a moment, and then he said resolutely:"

18341,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""No, I will not go. I am already close to the house, and I will return"
18342,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,home to my papa who is waiting for me. Who can tell how often the poor

18344,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"been a bad son, indeed, and the Talking-cricket was right when he said"
18345,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,'Disobedient boys never come to any good in the world.' I have
18346,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"found it to my cost, for many misfortunes have happened to me. Even"
18347,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,yesterday in Fire-eater's house I ran the risk.... Oh! it makes me
18348,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"shudder only to think of it."""
18349,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18350,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""Well, then,"" said the Fox, ""you are quite decided to go home? Go,"

18367,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""I will explain it to you at once,"" said the Fox. ""You must know that"
18368,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,in the Land of the Owls there is a sacred field called by everybody
18369,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"the Field of Miracles. In this field you must dig a little hole, and"
18370,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"you put into it, we will say one gold piece. Then you cover up the"
18371,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,hole with a little earth; you water it with two pails of water from
18372,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"the fountain, then sprinkle it with two pinches of salt, and when"
18373,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"night comes you can go quietly to bed. In the meanwhile, during the"
18374,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"night, the gold piece will grow and flower, and in the morning when"
18375,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"you return to the field, what do you find? You find a beautiful tree"

18378,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,
18379,THE SHOWMAN BECOMES GENEROUS,"""So that,"" said Pinocchio, more and more bewildered, ""supposing I"

18422,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"to-morrow morning."""
18423,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18424,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"Having gone into the inn they all three sat down to table, but none of"
18425,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,them had any appetite.
18426,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18427,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"The Cat, who was suffering from indigestion and feeling seriously"
18428,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"indisposed, could only eat thirty-five mullet with tomato sauce, and"
18429,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,four portions of tripe with Parmesan cheese; and because she thought
18430,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"the tripe was not seasoned enough, she asked three times for the"
18431,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,butter and grated cheese!
18432,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18433,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"The Fox would also willingly have picked a little, but as his doctor"
18434,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"had ordered him a strict diet, he was forced to content himself simply"
18435,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"with a hare dressed with a sweet and sour sauce, and garnished lightly"
18436,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,with fat chickens and early pullets. After the hare he sent for a made
18437,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"dish of partridges, rabbits, frogs, lizards, and other delicacies;"
18438,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"he could not touch anything else. He had such a disgust for food, he"
18439,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"said, that he could put nothing to his lips."
18440,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18441,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,The one who ate the least was Pinocchio. He asked for some walnuts
18442,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"and a hunch of bread, and left everything on his plate. The poor boy,"
18443,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"whose thoughts were continually fixed on the Field of Miracles, had"
18444,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,got in anticipation an indigestion of gold pieces.
18445,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18446,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,When they had supped the Fox said to the host:
18447,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18448,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Give us two good rooms, one for Mr. Pinocchio, and the other for"
18449,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,me and my companion. We will snatch a little sleep before we leave.
18450,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"Remember, however, that at midnight we wish to be called to continue"
18451,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"our journey."""
18452,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18453,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Yes, gentlemen,"" answered the host, and he winked at the Fox and the"
18454,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"Cat as much as to say: ""I know what you are up to. We understand one"
18455,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"another!"""
18456,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18457,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,No sooner had Pinocchio got into bed than he fell asleep at once and
18458,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"began to dream. And he dreamt that he was in the middle of a field,"
18459,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,and the field was filled with shrubs covered with clusters of gold
18460,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"pieces, and as they swung in the wind they went zin, zin, zin, almost"
18461,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"as if they would say: ""Let who will come and take us."" But when"
18462,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"Pinocchio was at the most interesting moment, that is, just as he"
18463,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,was stretching out his hand to pick handfuls of those beautiful gold
18464,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"pieces and put them in his pockets, he was suddenly wakened by three"
18465,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,violent blows on the door of his room.
18466,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18467,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,It was the host who had come to tell him that midnight had struck.
18468,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18469,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Are my companions ready?"" asked the puppet."
18470,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18471,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Ready! Why, they left two hours ago."""
18472,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18473,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Why were they in such a hurry?"""
18474,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18475,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Because the Cat had received a message to say that her eldest kitten"
18476,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"was ill with chilblains on his feet, and was in danger of death."""
18477,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18478,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""Did they pay for supper?"""
18479,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18480,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""What are you thinking of? They are too highly educated to dream of"
18481,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"offering such an insult to a gentleman like you."""
18482,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18483,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""What a pity! It is an insult that would have given me so much"
18484,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"pleasure!"" said Pinocchio, scratching his head. He then asked:"
18485,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18486,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""And where did my good friends say they would wait for me?"""
18487,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18488,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"""At the Field of Miracles, to-morrow morning at daybreak."""
18489,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18490,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,Pinocchio paid a gold piece for his supper and that of his companions
18491,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,and then he left.
18492,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,
18493,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,Outside the inn it was so pitch dark that he had almost to grope his
18494,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"way, for it was impossible to see a hand's breadth in front of him."
18495,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,In the adjacent country not a leaf moved. Only some night-birds flying
18496,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,across the road from one hedge to the other brushed Pinocchio's nose
18497,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"with their wings as they passed, which caused him so much terror that"
18498,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"springing back, he shouted: ""Who goes there?"" and the echo in the"
18499,THE INN OF THE RED-CRAWFISH,"surrounding hills repeated in the distance: ""Who goes there? Who goes"

18506,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18507,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18508,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"He turned to look, and saw in the gloom two evil-looking black figures"
18509,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,completely enveloped in charcoal sacks. They were running after him on
18510,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"tiptoe, and making great leaps like two phantoms."
18511,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18512,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Here they are in reality!"" he said to himself, and not knowing where"
18513,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,to hide his gold pieces he put them in his mouth precisely under his
18514,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,tongue.
18515,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18516,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,Then he tried to escape. But he had not gone a step when he felt
18517,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"himself seized by the arm, and heard two sepulchral voices saying to"
18518,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,him:
18519,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18520,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Your money or your life!"""
18521,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18522,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"Pinocchio, not being able to answer in words, owing to the money in"
18523,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"his mouth, made a thousand low bows and a thousand pantomimes. He"
18524,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"tried thus to make the two muffled figures, whose eyes were only"
18525,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"visible through the holes in their sacks, understand that he was"
18526,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"a poor puppet, and that he had not as much as a false penny in his"
18527,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,pocket.
18528,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18529,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Come now! Less nonsense and out with the money!"" cried the two"
18530,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,brigands threateningly.
18531,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18532,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"And the puppet made a gesture with his hands to signify ""I have got"
18533,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"none."""
18534,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18535,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Deliver up your money or you are dead,"" said the tallest of the"
18536,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,brigands.
18537,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18538,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Dead!"" repeated the other."
18539,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18540,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""And after we have killed you, we will also kill your father!"""
18541,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18542,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Also your father!"""
18543,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18544,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""No, no, no, not my poor papa!"" cried Pinocchio in a despairing tone;"
18545,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"and as he said it, the gold pieces clinked in his mouth."
18546,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18547,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""Ah! You rascal! Then you have hidden your money under your tongue!"
18548,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"Spit it out at once!"""
18549,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18550,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,But Pinocchio was obdurate.
18551,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18552,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"And one of them seized the puppet by the end of his nose, and the"
18553,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"other took him by the chin, and began to pull them brutally, the one"
18554,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"up, and the other down, to constrain him to open his mouth, but it was"
18555,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,all to no purpose. Pinocchio's mouth seemed to be nailed and riveted
18556,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,together.
18557,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18558,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,Then the shortest assassin drew out an ugly knife and tried to force
18559,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,it between his lips like a lever or chisel. But Pinocchio as quick
18560,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"as lightning caught his hand with his teeth, and with one bite bit it"
18561,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,clean off and spat it out. Imagine his astonishment when instead of a
18562,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,hand he perceived that he had spat a cat's paw on to the ground.
18563,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18564,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,Encouraged by his first victory he used his nails to such purpose that
18565,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"he succeeded in liberating himself from his assailants, and jumping"
18566,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,the hedge by the roadside he began to fly across the country. The
18567,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,assassins ran after him like two dogs chasing a hare; and the one who
18568,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,had lost the paw ran on one leg and no one ever knew how he managed
18569,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,it.
18570,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18571,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,After a race of some miles Pinocchio could do no more. Giving himself
18572,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,up for lost he climbed the stem of a very high pine-tree and seated
18573,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,himself in the topmost branches. The assassins attempted to climb
18574,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"after him, but when they had reached halfway up the stem they slid"
18575,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"down again, and arrived on the ground with the skin grazed from their"
18576,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,hands and knees.
18577,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18578,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,But they were not to be beaten by so little; collecting a quantity of
18579,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,dry wood they piled it beneath the pine and set fire to it. In less
18580,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,time than it takes to tell the pine began to burn and flame like
18581,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"a candle blown by the wind. Pinocchio, seeing that the flames were"
18582,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"mounting higher every instant, and not wishing to end his life like"
18583,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"a roasted pigeon, made a stupendous leap from the top of the tree and"
18584,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,started afresh across the fields and vineyards. The assassins followed
18585,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"him, and kept behind him without once giving in."
18586,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18587,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,The day began to break and they were still pursuing him. Suddenly
18588,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"Pinocchio found his way barred by a wide, deep ditch full of dirty"
18589,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"water the color of coffee. What was he to do? ""One! two! three!"""
18590,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"cried the puppet, and making a rush he sprang to the other side."
18591,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"The assassins also jumped, but not having measured the distance"
18592,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"properly--splash, splash!... they fell into the very middle of the"
18593,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"ditch. Pinocchio who heard the plunge and the splashing of water,"
18594,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"shouted out, laughing and without stopping:"
18595,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18596,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"""A fine bath to you, gentlemen assassins."""
18597,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,
18598,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"He felt convinced that they were drowned, when, turning to look he"
18599,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,"perceived that, on the contrary, they were both running after him,"
18600,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,still enveloped in their sacks with the water dripping from them as if
18601,THE PUPPET FALLS AMONG ASSASSINS,they had been two hollow baskets....

18609,THE FOX AND THE CAT,Pinocchio set out; and as soon as he was in the wood he began to run
18610,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"like a kid. But when he had reached a certain spot, almost in front"
18611,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"of the Big Oak, he stopped because he thought that he heard people"
18612,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"amongst the bushes. In fact, two persons came out on the road. Can you"
18613,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"guess who they were?... His two traveling companions, the Fox and the"
18614,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Cat, with whom he had supped at the Inn of the Red-Crawfish."
18615,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18616,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Why here is our dear Pinocchio!"" cried the Fox, kissing and embracing"
18617,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"him. ""How come you to be here?"""
18618,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18619,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""How come you to be here?"" repeated the Cat."
18620,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18621,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""It is a long story,"" answered the puppet, ""which I will tell you when"
18622,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"I have time. But do you know that the other night, when you left me"
18623,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"alone at the inn, I met with assassins on the road."""
18624,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18625,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Assassins!... Oh, poor Pinocchio! And what did they want?"""
18626,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18627,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""They wanted to rob me of my gold pieces."""
18628,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18629,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Villains!"" said the Fox."
18630,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18631,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Infamous villains!"" repeated the Cat."
18632,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18633,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""But I ran away from them,"" continued the puppet, ""and they followed"
18634,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"me, and at last they overtook me and hung me to a branch of that"
18635,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"oak-tree."""
18636,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18637,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"And Pinocchio pointed to the Big Oak, which was two steps from them."
18638,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18639,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Is it possible to hear of anything more dreadful?"" said the Fox. ""In"
18640,THE FOX AND THE CAT,what a world we are condemned to live! Where can respectable people
18641,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"like us find a safe refuge?"""
18642,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18643,THE FOX AND THE CAT,Whilst they were thus talking Pinocchio observed that the Cat was lame
18644,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"of her front right leg, for in fact she had lost her paw with all its"
18645,THE FOX AND THE CAT,claws. He therefore asked her:
18646,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18647,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""What have you done with your paw!"""
18648,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18649,THE FOX AND THE CAT,The Cat tried to answer but became confused. Therefore the Fox said
18650,THE FOX AND THE CAT,immediately:
18651,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18652,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""My friend is too modest, and that is why she doesn't speak. I will"
18653,THE FOX AND THE CAT,answer for her. I must tell you that an hour ago we met an old wolf on
18654,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"the road, almost fainting from want of food, who asked alms of us. Not"
18655,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"having so much as a fish-bone to give to him, what did my friend, who"
18656,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"has really the heart of a Cæsar, do? She bit off one of her forepaws,"
18657,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"and threw it to that poor beast that he might appease his hunger."""
18658,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18659,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"And the Fox, in relating this, dried a tear."
18660,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18661,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Pinocchio was also touched, and approaching the Cat he whispered into"
18662,THE FOX AND THE CAT,her ear:
18663,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18664,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""If all cats resemble you, how fortunate the mice would be!"""
18665,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18666,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""And now, what are you doing here?"" asked the Fox of the puppet."
18667,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18668,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""I am waiting for my papa, whom I expect to arrive every moment."""
18669,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18670,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""And your gold pieces?"""

18672,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""I have got them in my pocket, all but one that I spent at the Inn of"
18673,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"the Red-Crawfish."""
18674,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18675,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""And to think that, instead of four pieces, by to-morrow they might"
18676,THE FOX AND THE CAT,become one or two thousand! Why do you not listen to my advice? why
18677,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"will you not go and bury them in the Field of Miracles?"""
18678,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18679,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""To-day it is impossible, I will go another day."""
18680,THE FOX AND THE CAT,

18682,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18683,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Why?"""
18684,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18685,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Because the field has been bought by a gentleman, and after to-morrow"
18686,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"no one will be allowed to bury money there."""
18687,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18688,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""How far off is the Field of Miracles?"""
18689,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18690,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Not two miles. Will you come with us? In half an hour you will be"
18691,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"there. You can bury your money at once, and in a few minutes you"
18692,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"will collect two thousand, and this evening you will return with your"

18694,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18695,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Pinocchio thought of the good Fairy, old Geppetto, and the warning of"
18696,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"the Talking-cricket, and he hesitated a little before answering. He"
18697,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"ended however, by doing as all boys do who have not a grain of sense"
18698,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"and who have no heart--he ended by giving his head a little shake, and"
18699,THE FOX AND THE CAT,saying to the Fox and Cat:
18700,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18701,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Let us go: I will come with you."""
18702,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18703,THE FOX AND THE CAT,And they went.
18704,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18705,THE FOX AND THE CAT,After having walked half the day they reached a town that was called
18706,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Trap for Blockheads."" As soon as Pinocchio entered this town, he saw"
18707,THE FOX AND THE CAT,that the streets were crowded with dogs who had lost their coats and
18708,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"who were yawning from hunger, shorn sheep trembling with cold, cocks"
18709,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"without combs or crests who were begging for a grain of Indian corn,"
18710,THE FOX AND THE CAT,large butterflies who could no longer fly because they had sold their
18711,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"beautiful colored wings, peacocks who had no tails and were ashamed to"
18712,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"be seen, and pheasants who went scratching about in a subdued fashion,"
18713,THE FOX AND THE CAT,mourning for their brilliant gold and silver feathers gone for ever.
18714,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18715,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"In the midst of this crowd of beggars and shamefaced creatures,"
18716,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"some lordly carriage passed from time to time containing a Fox, or a"
18717,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"thieving Magpie, or some other ravenous bird of prey."
18718,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18719,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""And where is the Field of Miracles?"" asked Pinocchio."
18720,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18721,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""It is here, not two steps from us."""
18722,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18723,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"They crossed the town, and having gone beyond the walls they came to a"
18724,THE FOX AND THE CAT,solitary field which to look at resembled all other fields.
18725,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18726,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""We are arrived,"" said the Fox to the puppet. ""Now stoop down and dig"
18727,THE FOX AND THE CAT,with your hands a little hole in the ground and put your gold pieces

18729,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18730,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Pinocchio obeyed. He dug a hole, put into it the four gold pieces that"
18731,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"he had left, and then filled up the hole with a little earth."
18732,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18733,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Now, then,"" said the Fox, ""go to that canal close to us, fetch a can"
18734,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"of water, and water the ground where you have sowed them."""
18735,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18736,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Pinocchio went to the canal, and as he had no can he took off one of"
18737,THE FOX AND THE CAT,his old shoes and filling it with water he watered the ground over the
18738,THE FOX AND THE CAT,hole.
18739,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18740,THE FOX AND THE CAT,He then asked:
18741,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18742,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Is there anything else to be done?"""
18743,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18744,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""Nothing else,"" answered the Fox. ""We can now go away. You can return"
18745,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"in about twenty minutes, and you will find a shrub already pushing"
18746,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"through the ground, with its branches quite loaded with money."""
18747,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18748,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"The poor puppet, beside himself with joy, thanked the Fox and the Cat"
18749,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"a thousand times, and promised them a beautiful present."
18750,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18751,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"""We wish for no presents,"" answered the two rascals. ""It is enough for"
18752,THE FOX AND THE CAT,us to have taught you the way to enrich yourself without undergoing
18753,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"hard work, and we are as happy as folk out for a holiday."""
18754,THE FOX AND THE CAT,
18755,THE FOX AND THE CAT,"Thus saying they took leave of Pinocchio, and wishing him a good"
18756,THE FOX AND THE CAT,harvest went about their business.

18764,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,The puppet returned to the town and began to count the minutes one by
18765,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,one; and when he thought it must be time he took the road leading to
18766,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,the Field of Miracles.
18767,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18768,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"And as he walked along with hurried steps his heart beat fast, tic,"
18769,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"tac, tic, tac, like a drawing-room clock when it is really going well."
18770,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,Meanwhile he was thinking to himself:
18771,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18772,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""And if instead of a thousand gold pieces, I was to find on the"
18773,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,branches of the tree two thousand?... And instead of two thousand
18774,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,supposing I found five thousand? and instead of five thousand that
18775,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,I found a hundred thousand? Oh! what a fine gentleman I should then
18776,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"become!... I would have a beautiful palace, a thousand little wooden"
18777,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"horses and a thousand stables to amuse myself with, a cellar full of"
18778,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"currant-wine, and sweet syrups, and a library quite full of candies,"
18779,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"tarts, plum-cakes, macaroons, and biscuits with cream."""
18780,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18781,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,Whilst he was building these castles in the air he had arrived in
18782,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"the neighborhood of the field, and he stopped to look if by chance he"
18783,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,could perceive a tree with its branches laden with money; but he saw
18784,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,nothing. He advanced another hundred steps--nothing; he entered the
18785,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,field ... he went right up to the little hole where he had buried
18786,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"his gold pieces--and nothing. He then became very thoughtful, and"
18787,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,forgetting the rules of society and good manners he took his hands out
18788,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,of his pockets and gave his head a long scratch.
18789,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18790,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"At that moment he heard an explosion of laughter close to him, and"
18791,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"looking up he saw a large Parrot perched on a tree, who was preening"
18792,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,the few feathers he had left.
18793,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18794,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""Why are you laughing?"" asked Pinocchio in an angry voice."
18795,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,

18802,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18803,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"Whilst he was thus occupied another laugh, and still more impertinent"

18809,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""I am laughing at those simpletons who believe in all the foolish"

18817,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"same way as beans and gourds. I also believed it once, and to-day I"
18818,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,am suffering for it. To-day--but it is too late--I have at last learnt
18819,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,that to put a few pennies honestly together it is necessary to know
18820,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"how to earn them, either by the work of our own hands or by the"

18826,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""Have patience! I will explain myself better,"" rejoined the Parrot."
18827,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""You must know, then, that whilst you were in the town the Fox and the"

18831,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"Pinocchio remained with his mouth open, and not choosing to believe"
18832,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,the Parrot's words he began with his hands and nails to dig up the
18833,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"earth that he had watered. And he dug, and dug, and dug, and made such"
18834,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,a deep hole that a rick of straw might have stood up in it; but the
18835,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,money was no longer there.
18836,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18837,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"He rushed back to the town in a state of desperation, and went at once"
18838,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,to the Courts of Justice to denounce the two knaves who had robbed him
18839,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,to the judge.
18840,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18841,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,The judge was a big ape of the gorilla tribe--an old ape respectable
18842,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"for his age, his white beard, but especially for his gold spectacles"
18843,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"without glasses that he always was obliged to wear, on account of an"
18844,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,inflammation of the eyes that had tormented him for many years.
18845,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18846,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,Pinocchio related in the presence of the judge all the particulars of
18847,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"the infamous fraud of which he had been the victim. He gave the names,"
18848,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"the surnames, and other details, of the two rascals, and ended by"
18849,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,demanding justice.
18850,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18851,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,The judge listened with great benignity; took a lively interest in the
18852,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,story; and was much touched and moved; and when the puppet had nothing
18853,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,further to say he stretched out his hand and rang a bell.
18854,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18855,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,At this summons two mastiffs immediately appeared dressed as
18856,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"gendarmes. The judge then, pointing to Pinocchio said to them:"
18857,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18858,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""That poor devil has been robbed of four gold pieces; take him up, and"
18859,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"put him immediately into prison."""
18860,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18861,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"The puppet was petrified on hearing this unexpected sentence, and"
18862,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"tried to protest; but the gendarmes, to avoid losing time, stopped his"
18863,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"mouth, and carried him off to the lockup."
18864,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18865,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,And there he remained for four months--four long months--and he would
18866,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,have remained longer still if a fortunate chance had not released him.
18867,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,For I must tell you that the young Emperor who reigned over the town
18868,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"of ""Trap for Blockheads,"" having won a splendid victory over his"
18869,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"enemies, ordered great public rejoicings. There were illuminations,"
18870,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"fire-works, horse races, and velocipede races, and as a further sign"
18871,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,of triumph he commanded that the prisons should be opened and all
18872,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,prisoners liberated.
18873,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18874,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""If the others are to be let out of prison, I will go also,"" said"
18875,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,Pinocchio to the jailor.
18876,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18877,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""No, not you,"" said the jailor, ""because you do not belong to the"
18878,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"fortunate class."""
18879,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18880,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""I beg your pardon,"" replied Pinocchio, ""I am also a criminal."""
18881,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,
18882,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,"""In that case you are perfectly right,"" said the jailor; and taking"
18883,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,off his hat and bowing to him respectfully he opened the prison door
18884,PINOCCHIO IS ROBBED,and let him escape.

18906,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. His surname meant"

18908,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,still very far removed from being poor. He had inherited a small

18910,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"carelessly, without any serious thoughts of work, till he was about"

18913,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and"

18916,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18917,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""I should like to live,"" he said to himself, ""till I am five or six"

18920,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18921,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally"
18922,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"henceforth, to prolong his life as long as he wished."
18923,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18924,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had
18925,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"lived a thousand years, and there was a Princess of Yamato, who it was"
18926,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"said, lived to the age of five hundred. This was the latest story of a"
18927,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,very long life on record.
18928,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18929,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named
18930,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Shin-no-Shiko. He was one of the most able and powerful rulers in
18931,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Chinese history. He built all the large palaces, and also the famous"
18932,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"great wall of China. He had everything in the world he could wish for,"
18933,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"but in spite of all his happiness, and the luxury and splendor of his"
18934,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"court, the wisdom of his councilors and the glory of his reign, he was"
18935,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave it all.
18936,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18937,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning,"
18938,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"as he went through his day, the thought of death was always with him."
18939,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,He could not get away from it. Ah--if only he could find the Elixir of
18940,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Life, he would be happy."
18941,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18942,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them
18943,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,all if they could not find for him the Elixir of Life of which he had
18944,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,so often read and heard.
18945,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18946,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas"
18947,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"there was a country called Horaizan, and that certain hermits lived"
18948,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,there who possessed the secret of the Elixir of Life. Whoever drank of
18949,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,this wonderful draught lived forever.
18950,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18951,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to"
18952,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"find the hermits, and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir."
18953,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it out for him, and"
18954,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for
18955,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Jofuku to take as presents to the hermits.
18956,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18957,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned to the"
18958,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,waiting Emperor; but ever since that time Mount Fuji has been said to
18959,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of
18960,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"the elixir, and Jofuku has been worshipped as their patron god."
18961,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18962,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he"
18963,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"could, to become one, so that he might obtain the water of perpetual"
18964,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,life. He remembered that as a child he had been told that not only did
18965,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit"
18966,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,all the very high peaks.
18967,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18968,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and started out"
18969,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,on his quest. He traveled through all the mountainous regions of the
18970,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"land, climbing to the tops of the highest peaks, but never a hermit"
18971,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,did he find.
18972,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18973,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many days, he met a"
18974,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,hunter.
18975,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18976,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""Can you tell me,"" asked Sentaro, ""where the hermits live who have the"

18978,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18979,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""No,"" said the hunter; ""I can't tell you where such hermits live, but"
18980,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,there is a notorious robber living in these parts. It is said that he
18981,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"is chief of a band of two hundred followers."""
18982,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18983,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"This odd answer irritated Sentaro very much, and he thought how"
18984,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this
18985,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"way, so he decided to go at once to the shrine of Jofuku, who is"
18986,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,worshipped as the patron god of the hermits in the South of Japan.
18987,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18988,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days, entreating"
18989,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he
18990,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,wanted so much to find.
18991,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18992,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"At midnight of the seventh day, as Sentaro knelt in the temple, the"
18993,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"door of the innermost shrine flew open, and Jofuku appeared in a"
18994,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"luminous cloud, and calling to Sentaro to come nearer, spoke thus:"
18995,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
18996,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""Your desire is a very selfish one and cannot be easily granted. You"
18997,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir
18998,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,of Life. Do you know how hard a hermit's life is? A hermit is only
18999,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees; a hermit
19000,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become
19001,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire. Gradually after
19002,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"following these strict rules, the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold"
19003,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"or heat, and his body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or"
19004,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"a carp, and can walk on water without getting his feet wet."
19005,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19006,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort. You are"
19007,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"not even like an ordinary man, for you are exceptionally idle, and"
19008,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,more sensitive to heat and cold than most people. You would never be
19009,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin garment in the winter
19010,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,time! Do you think that you would ever have the patience or the
19011,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,endurance to live a hermit's life?
19012,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19013,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in another way."
19014,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"I will send you to the country of Perpetual Life, where death never"
19015,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"comes--where the people live for ever!"""
19016,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19017,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane made of"
19018,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"paper, telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there."
19019,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19020,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. The crane grew large enough for him to
19021,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"ride on it with comfort. It then spread its wings, rose high in the"
19022,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"air, and flew away over the mountains right out to sea."
19023,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19024,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro was at first quite frightened; but by degrees he grew
19025,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,accustomed to the swift flight through the air. On and on they went
19026,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"for thousands of miles. The bird never stopped for rest or food, but"
19027,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment,"
19028,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"and strange to say, neither did Sentaro."
19029,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19030,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,After several days they reached an island. The crane flew some
19031,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,distance inland and then alighted.
19032,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19033,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"As soon as Sentaro got down from the bird's back, the crane folded up"
19034,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,of its own accord and flew into his pocket.
19035,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19036,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Now Sentaro began to look about him wonderingly, curious to see what"
19037,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,the country of Perpetual Life was like. He walked first round about
19038,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"the country and then through the town. Everything was, of course,"
19039,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"quite strange, and different from his own land. But both the land and"
19040,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"the people seemed prosperous, so he decided that it would be good for"
19041,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,him to stay there and took up lodgings at one of the hotels.
19042,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19043,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"The proprietor was a kind man, and when Sentaro told him that he was a"
19044,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"stranger and had come to live there, he promised to arrange everything"
19045,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,that was necessary with the governor of the city concerning Sentaro's
19046,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"sojourn there. He even found a house for his guest, and in this way"
19047,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country
19048,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,of Perpetual Life.
19049,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19050,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there,"
19051,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,and sickness was a thing unknown. Priests had come over from India
19052,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"and China and told them of a beautiful country called Paradise, where"
19053,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"happiness and bliss and contentment fill all men's hearts, but its"
19054,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,gates could only be reached by dying. This tradition was handed down
19055,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,for ages from generation to generation--but none knew exactly what
19056,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,death was except that it led to Paradise.
19057,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19058,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Quite unlike Sentaro and other ordinary people, instead of having a"
19059,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"great dread of death, they all, both rich and poor, longed for it as"
19060,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"something good and desirable. They were all tired of their long,"
19061,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"long lives, and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called"
19062,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Paradise of which the priests had told them centuries ago.
19063,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19064,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders. He found
19065,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"himself, according to his ideas, in the land of _Topsy-turvydom_."
19066,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Everything was upside down. He had wished to escape from dying. He had
19067,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"come to the land of Perpetual Life with great relief and joy, only"
19068,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"to find that the inhabitants themselves, doomed never to die, would"
19069,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,consider it bliss to find death.
19070,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19071,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good
19072,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"food, and all the things to which he had been accustomed as food they"
19073,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"rejected. Whenever any merchants from other countries arrived, the"
19074,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons. These they swallowed
19075,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,eagerly hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise.
19076,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19077,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without effect in
19078,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"this strange place, and people who swallowed them with the hope of"
19079,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"dying, only found that in a short time they felt better in health"
19080,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,instead of worse.
19081,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19082,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like. The wealthy
19083,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,would have given all their money and all their goods if they could but
19084,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,shorten their lives to two or three hundred years even. Without any
19085,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"change, to live on forever, seemed to this people wearisome and sad."
19086,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19087,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"In the drug-shops there was a drug which was in constant demand,"
19088,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"because after using it for a hundred years, it was supposed to turn"
19089,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,the hair slightly gray and to bring about disorders of the stomach.
19090,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19091,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish was
19092,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"served up in restaurants as a delectable dish, and hawkers in the"
19093,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish flies. He never saw
19094,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"anyone ill after eating these horrible things, nor did he ever see"
19095,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,anyone with as much as a cold.
19096,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19097,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro was delighted. He said to himself that he would never grow
19098,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"tired of living, and that he considered it profane to wish for death."
19099,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,He was the only happy man on the island. For his part he wished
19100,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. He set himself up in
19101,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"business, and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his"
19102,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,native land.
19103,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19104,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"As years went by, however, things did not go as smoothly as at first."
19105,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"He had heavy losses in business, and several times some affairs went"
19106,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,wrong with his neighbors. This caused him great annoyance.
19107,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19108,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him, for he was busy from"
19109,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,morning till night. Three hundred years went by in this monotonous
19110,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"way, and then at last he began to grow tired of life in this country,"
19111,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,and he longed to see his own land and his old home. However long he
19112,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"lived here, life would always be the same, so was it not foolish and"
19113,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,wearisome to stay on here for ever?
19114,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19115,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Sentaro, in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual Life,"
19116,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"recollected Jofuku, who had helped him before when he was wishing to"
19117,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,escape from death--and he prayed to the saint to bring him back to his
19118,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,own land again.
19119,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19120,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket.
19121,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Sentaro was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all
19122,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,these years. Once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough
19123,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"for him to mount it. As he did so, the bird spread its wings and flew"
19124,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan.
19125,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19126,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Such was the wilfulness of the man's nature that he looked back and
19127,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,regretted all he had left behind. He tried to stop the bird in vain.
19128,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,The crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean.
19129,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19130,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Then a storm came on, and the wonderful paper crane got damp, crumpled"
19131,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"up, and fell into the sea. Sentaro fell with it. Very much frightened"
19132,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"at the thought of being drowned, he cried out loudly to Jofuku to save"
19133,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"him. He looked round, but there was no ship in sight. He swallowed"
19134,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"a quantity of sea-water, which only increased his miserable plight."
19135,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"While he was thus struggling to keep himself afloat, he saw a"
19136,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,monstrous shark swimming towards him. As it came nearer it opened its
19137,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,huge mouth ready to devour him. Sentaro was all but paralyzed with
19138,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"fear now that he felt his end so near, and screamed out as loudly as"
19139,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,ever he could to Jofuku to come and rescue him.
19140,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19141,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Lo, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams, to find that"
19142,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"during his long prayer he had fallen asleep before the shrine, and"
19143,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures had been only a
19144,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"wild dream. He was in a cold perspiration with fright, and utterly"
19145,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,bewildered.
19146,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19147,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"Suddenly a bright light came towards him, and in the light stood a"
19148,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,messenger. The messenger held a book in his hand and spoke to Sentaro:
19149,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19150,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""I am sent to you by Jofuku, who in answer to your prayer, has"
19151,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,permitted you in a dream to see the land of Perpetual Life. But you
19152,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"grew weary of living there, and begged to be allowed to return to your"
19153,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"native land so that you might die. Jofuku, so that he might try you,"
19154,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"allowed you to drop into the sea, and then sent a shark to swallow you"
19155,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"up. Your desire for death was not real, for even at that moment you"
19156,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,cried out loudly and shouted for help.
19157,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19158,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit, or to find the"
19159,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,Elixir of Life. These things are not for such as you--your life is not
19160,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"austere enough. It is best for you to go back to your paternal home,"
19161,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,and to live a good and industrious life. Never neglect to keep the
19162,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"anniversaries of your ancestors, and make it your duty to provide for"
19163,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,your children's future. Thus will you live to a good old age and be
19164,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"happy, but give up the vain desire to escape death, for no man can"
19165,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"do that, and by this time you have surely found out that even when"
19166,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,selfish desires are granted they do not bring happiness.
19167,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19168,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"""In this book I give you there are many precepts good for you to"
19169,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"know--if you study them, you will be guided in the way I have pointed"
19170,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"out to you."""
19171,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,
19172,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking, and Sentaro"
19173,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,took the lesson to heart. With the book in his hand he returned to his
19174,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"old home, and giving up all his old vain wishes, tried to live a good"
19175,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,"and useful life and to observe the lessons taught him in the book, and"
19176,ADAPTED BY YEI THEODORA OZAKI,he and his house prospered henceforth.

19188,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"A long time ago, at a temple called Morinji, in the province of"
19189,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"Jhôsiu, there was an old teakettle. One day, when the priest of the"
19190,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the water for his
19191,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"tea, to his amazement the kettle all of a sudden put forth the head"
19192,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"and tail of a badger. What a wonderful kettle, to come out all over"
19193,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"fur! The priest, thunderstruck, called in the novices of the temple to"
19194,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"see the sight; and whilst they were stupidly staring, one suggesting"
19195,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"one thing and another another, the kettle, jumping up into the air,"
19196,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"began flying about the room. More astonished than ever, the priest and"
19197,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,his pupils tried to pursue it; but no thief or cat was ever half so
19198,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"sharp as this wonderful badger-kettle. At last, however, they managed"
19199,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"to knock it down and secure it; and, holding it in with their united"
19200,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"efforts, they forced it into a box, intending to carry it off and"
19201,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"throw it away in some distant place, so that they might be no more"
19202,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"plagued by the goblin. For this day their troubles were over; but, as"
19203,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"luck would have it, the tinker who was in the habit of working for the"
19204,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"temple called in, and the priest suddenly bethought him that it was a"
19205,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"pity to throw the kettle away for nothing, and that he might as"
19206,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"well get a trifle for it, no matter how small. So he brought out the"
19207,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"kettle, which had resumed its former shape and had got rid of its head"
19208,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"and tail, and showed it to the tinker. When the tinker saw the kettle,"
19209,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"he offered twenty copper coins for it, and the priest was only too"
19210,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,glad to close the bargain and be rid of his troublesome piece of
19211,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,furniture. But the tinker trudged off home with his pack and his new
19212,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"purchase. That night, as he lay asleep, he heard a strange noise near"
19213,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"his pillow; so he peered out from under the bedclothes, and there he"
19214,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"saw the kettle that he had bought in the temple covered with fur, and"
19215,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,walking about on four legs. The tinker started up in a fright to see
19216,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"what it could all mean, when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its"
19217,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"former shape. This happened over and over again, until at last the"
19218,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"tinker showed the teakettle to a friend of his, who said: ""This is"
19219,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,certainly an accomplished and lucky teakettle. You should take it
19220,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"about as a show, with songs and accompaniments of musical instruments,"
19221,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"and make it dance and walk on the tight rope."""
19222,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,
19223,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"The tinker, thinking this good advice, made arrangements with"
19224,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"a showman, and set up an exhibition. The noise of the kettle's"
19225,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"performances soon spread abroad, until even the Princes of the land"
19226,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,sent to order the tinker to come to them; and he grew rich beyond all
19227,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"his expectations. Even the Princesses, too, and the great ladies of"
19228,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,"the court, took great delight in the dancing kettle, so that no sooner"
19229,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,had it shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep
19230,ADAPTED BY A. B. MITFORD,some other engagement. At last the tinker grew so rich that he took

19276,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,
19277,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"Again the Sparrow brought out two wicker baskets, and asked as before,"
19278,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"""Will you take the heavy one, or shall I give you the light one?"""
19279,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,
19280,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,Thinking the treasure would be great in proportion to the weight of
19281,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"the basket, the old woman replied, ""Let me have the heavy one."""
19282,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,
19283,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"Receiving this, she started home with it on her back, the sparrows"
19284,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"laughing at her as she went. It was as heavy as a stone, and hard to"
19285,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"carry, but at last she got back with it to her house."
19286,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,
19287,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"Then, when she took off the lid and looked in, a whole troop of"
19288,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,"frightful creatures came bouncing out from the inside, and at once"
19289,THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW,they caught her up and flew away with her.

19298,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,
19299,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,A monkey and a Crab once met when going round a mountain.
19300,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,
19301,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"The Monkey had picked up a persimmon-seed, and the Crab had a piece"
19302,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"of toasted rice-cake. The Monkey, seeing this, and wishing to get"
19303,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"something that could be turned to good account at once, said, ""Pray,"
19304,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"exchange that rice-cake for this persimmon-seed."" The Crab, without a"
19305,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"word, gave up his cake, and took the persimmon-seed and planted it. At"
19306,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"once it sprung up, and soon became a tree so high one had to look far"
19307,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"up to see it. The tree was full of persimmons, but the Crab had no"
19308,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"means of climbing it, so he asked the Monkey to scramble up and get"
19309,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,the fruit for him. The Monkey got up on a limb of the tree and began
19310,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"to eat the persimmons. The unripe ones he threw at the Crab, but all"
19311,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,the ripe and good ones he put in his pouch. The Crab under the tree
19312,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"thus got his shell badly bruised, and only by good luck escaped into"
19313,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"his hole, where he lay distressed with pain, and not able to get up."
19314,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"Now, when the relatives and household of the Crab heard how matters"
19315,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"stood, they were surprised and angry, and declared war, and attacked"
19316,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"the Monkey, who, leading forth a numerous following, bade defiance to"
19317,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"the other party. The crabs, finding themselves unable to meet and"
19318,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"cope with this force, became still more exasperated and enraged,"
19319,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,and retreated into their hole and held a council of war. Then came a
19320,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"rice-mortar, a pestle, a bee, and an egg, and together they devised a"
19321,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,deep-laid plot to be avenged.
19322,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,
19323,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"First, they requested that peace be made with the crabs; and thus they"
19324,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"induced the king of the monkeys to enter their hole unattended, and"
19325,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"seated him on the hearth. The Monkey, not suspecting any plot, took"
19326,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"the _hibashi_, or poker, to stir up the slumbering fire, when bang!"
19327,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"went the egg, which was lying hidden in the ashes, and burned the"
19328,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"Monkey's arm. Surprised and alarmed, he plunged his arm into the"
19329,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,pickle-tub in the kitchen to relieve the pain of the burn. Then the
19330,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"bee which was hidden near the tub stung him sharply in his face,"
19331,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"already wet with tears. Without waiting to brush off the bee, and"
19332,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"howling bitterly, he rushed for the back door; but just then some"
19333,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,seaweed entangled his legs and made him slip. Then down came the
19334,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"pestle, tumbling on him from a shelf, and the mortar, too, came"
19335,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"rolling down on him from the roof of the porch and broke his back, and"
19336,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,so weakened him that he was unable to rise up. Then out came the crabs
19337,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,"in a crowd, and brandishing on high their pinchers they pinched the"
19338,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,Monkey so sorely that he begged them for forgiveness and promised
19339,BATTLE OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB,never to repeat his meanness and treachery.

19347,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19348,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19349,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",A long long time ago there lived an old man and an old woman. One day
19350,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",the old man went to the mountains to cut grass; and the old woman went
19351,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",to the river to wash clothes. While she was washing a great thing came
19352,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",tumbling and splashing down the stream. When the old woman saw it she
19353,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","was very glad, and pulled it to her with a piece of bamboo that lay"
19354,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",near by. When she took it up and looked at it she saw that it was a
19355,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",very large peach. She then quickly finished her washing and returned
19356,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",home intending to give the peach to her old man to eat.
19357,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19358,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","When she cut the peach in two, out came a child from the large kernel."
19359,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Seeing this the old couple rejoiced, and named the child Momotaro,"
19360,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","or Little Peachling, because he came out of a peach. As both the"
19361,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","old people took good care of him, he grew and became strong and"
19362,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","enterprising. So the old couple had their expectations raised, and"
19363,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",bestowed still more care on his education.
19364,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19365,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Momotaro finding that he excelled everybody in strength, determined"
19366,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","to cross over to the island of the devils, take their riches, and come"
19367,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",back. He at once consulted with the old man and the old woman about
19368,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","the matter, and got them to make him some dumplings. These he put"
19369,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",in his pouch. Besides this he made every kind of preparation for his
19370,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",journey to the island of the devils and set out.
19371,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19372,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Then first a dog came to the side of the way and said, ""Momotaro! What"
19373,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","have you there hanging at your belt?"" He replied, ""I have some of the"
19374,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","very best Japanese millet dumplings."" ""Give me one and I will go with"
19375,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","you,"" said the dog. So Momotaro took a dumpling out of his pouch and"
19376,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",gave it to the dog. Then a monkey came and got one the same way. A
19377,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","pheasant also came flying and said, ""Give me a dumpling too, and I"
19378,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","will go along with you."" So all three went along with him. In no time"
19379,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","they arrived at the island of the devils, and at once broke through"
19380,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",the front gate; Momotaro first; then his three followers. Here they
19381,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","met a great multitude of the devils' retainers who showed fight, but"
19382,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","they pressed still inwards, and at last encountered the chief of the"
19383,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","devils, called Akandoji. Then came the tug of war. Akandoji hit at"
19384,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Momotaro with an iron club, but Momotaro was ready for him, and dodged"
19385,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","him adroitly. At last they grappled each other, and without difficulty"
19386,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",Momotaro just crushed down Akandoji and tied him with a rope so
19387,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",tightly that he could not even move. All this was done in a fair
19388,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",fight.
19389,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19390,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",After this Akandoji the chief of the devils said he would surrender
19391,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","all his riches. ""Out with your riches then,"" said Momotaro laughing."
19392,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Having collected and ranged in order a great pile of precious things,"
19393,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","Momotaro took them, and set out for his home, rejoicing, as he marched"
19394,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","bravely back, that, with the help of his three companions, to whom he"
19395,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","attributed all his success, he had been able so easily to accomplish"
19396,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",his end.
19397,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",
19398,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING",Great was the joy of the old man and the old woman when Momotaro
19399,"MOMOTARO, OR LITTLE PEACHLING","came back. He feasted everybody bountifully, told many stories of his"

19410,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19411,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19412,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Uraschima Taro, which means in Japanese ""Son of the Island,"" was the"
19413,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,only and dearly beloved son of an old fisherman and his wife:
19414,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19415,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"He was a fine, strong youth, who could manage a boat more cleverly"
19416,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,than any one else on the neighboring coast. He often ventured so far
19417,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,out to sea that neighbors warned his parents that he would sometime go
19418,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,too far and never return.
19419,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19420,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"His parents knew, however, that he understood his boat and the sea"
19421,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"very well, and they were never much concerned about him. Even when"
19422,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"he failed to come back as soon as he was expected, they awaited his"
19423,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"return without anxiety. They loved him better than their own lives,"
19424,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,and were proud that he was braver and stronger than their neighbors'
19425,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,sons.
19426,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19427,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Early one morning, Uraschima Taro went to haul in his nets, which had"
19428,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"been set the night before. In one of them, among some fishes, he found"
19429,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"a small turtle. This he placed in the boat, by itself, where it would"
19430,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"safely keep, until he could take it home. To his amazement, the turtle"
19431,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"begged for its life in most pitiful tones. ""Of what use am I to you?"""
19432,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"it asked. ""I am too small to eat, and so young that it will take me a"
19433,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"long time to grow. Have mercy and put me back into the sea, for I do"
19434,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"not want to die."" Uraschima Taro had a very kind heart and could not"
19435,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,bear to see anything that was small and helpless suffer; so he did as
19436,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,the turtle asked him.
19437,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19438,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Several years after this, when Uraschima Taro was one day far out at"
19439,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"sea, a terrible whirlwind struck his boat and shattered it. He was a"
19440,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"good swimmer, and managed for a long time to make progress toward the"
19441,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"land; but as he was so far from shore in the rough sea, his strength"
19442,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,at last gave out and he felt himself sinking. Just as he had given up
19443,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"hope, and thought that he would never see his dear parents again, he"
19444,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,heard his name called and saw a large turtle swimming toward him.
19445,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19446,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"""Climb on my back,"" shouted the turtle, ""and I will carry you to"
19447,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"land."" When Uraschima Taro was safely sitting on the turtle's back it"
19448,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"continued: ""I am the turtle whose life you saved when you found me,"
19449,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"little and helpless, in your net, and I am glad of this opportunity to"
19450,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"show that I am not ungrateful."""
19451,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19452,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Before they reached the shore, the turtle asked Uraschima Taro how he"
19453,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,would like to be shown some of the wonderful beauties hidden under the
19454,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,sea. The young fisherman replied that the experience would please him.
19455,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,In a moment they were shooting down through the green water. He clung
19456,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"to the turtle's back, who carried him many, many fathoms below."
19457,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"After three nights they reached the bottom of the sea, and came to a"
19458,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,wonderful palace of gold and crystal. Coral and pearls and precious
19459,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"stones dazzled his eyes; but inside, the palace was more beautiful"
19460,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"still, and blazing fish scales lighted it."
19461,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19462,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"""This,"" said the turtle, ""is the palace of the sea-god. I am a"
19463,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"waiting-maid to his lovely daughter, the Princess."""
19464,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19465,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,The turtle went to announce the arrival of Uraschima Taro to the
19466,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Princess, and soon returning, led him to her presence. She was so"
19467,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,beautiful that when she asked him to remain in the palace he gladly
19468,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,consented.
19469,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19470,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"""Do not leave me, and you shall always be as handsome as you are now,"
19471,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"and old age cannot come to you,"" she said."
19472,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19473,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,So it happened that Uraschima Taro lived in the marvelous palace at
19474,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,the bottom of the sea with the daughter of the sea-god. He was so
19475,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,happy that the time passed by unheeded. How long he dwelt there he
19476,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,could not have told. But one day he thought of his parents; then he
19477,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,remembered that they must be troubled by his absence. The thought of
19478,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"them kept coming to him continually, and the longing to see them grew"
19479,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,so strong that at last he told the Princess he must go to visit them.
19480,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,She begged him not to leave her and wept bitterly.
19481,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19482,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"""If you go, I shall never see you again,"" she sobbed."
19483,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19484,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,But he told her that he must see his father and mother once again;
19485,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"then he would return to the palace in the sea, to be with her always."
19486,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"When she found that she could not persuade him to remain, she gave him"
19487,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"a small gold box, which, she told him, he must on no account open."
19488,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19489,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"""If you heed my words,"" said she, ""you may come back to me. When you"
19490,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"are ready, the turtle will be there to bring you; but if you forget"
19491,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"what I have told you, I shall never see you again."""
19492,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19493,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,Uraschima Taro fondly assured her that nothing in the world should
19494,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"keep him from her, and bade her farewell. Mounting the turtle's back,"
19495,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,he soon left the palace far below. For three days and three nights
19496,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"they swam, and then the turtle left him on the familiar sands near his"
19497,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,old home.
19498,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19499,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,He eagerly ran to the village and looked about for some of his
19500,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"comrades. All of the faces were strange, and even the houses seemed"
19501,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"different. The children, playing in the street where he had lived, he"
19502,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"had never seen before. Stopping in front of his own house, he regarded"
19503,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,it with a sinking heart. There was the sound of music from a window
19504,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"above, and a strange woman opened the door to him. She could tell him"
19505,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"nothing of his parents, and had never heard their names. Every one"
19506,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,whom he questioned looked at him curiously. At last he wandered from
19507,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,the village and came to the burying ground. Searching about among the
19508,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"graves, he soon found himself beside a stone bearing the dear names he"
19509,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,sought. The date showed him that his father and mother had died soon
19510,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,after he left them; and then he discovered that he had been away from
19511,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"his home three hundred years. Bowed with sorrow, he went back to the"
19512,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"city. At each step he hoped to wake and find it all a dream, but the"
19513,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,people and streets were real.
19514,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19515,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"He thought of the Princess, and remembered the gold box she had given"
19516,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"to him. It might be that he was under some cruel enchantment, and that"
19517,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,this box contained the charm to break the spell. He eagerly raised
19518,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"the cover, and a purple vapor escaped and left the box empty. To his"
19519,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"alarm, he noticed that the hand that held it had shriveled and grown"
19520,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"suddenly old. Trembling with horror, he ran to a stream of water which"
19521,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"ran down from the mountain, and saw reflected in its waters the face"
19522,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,of a mummy.
19523,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19524,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"He crawled fearfully back to the village, and no one recognized him"
19525,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,as the strong youth who had entered it a few hours before. Nearly
19526,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"exhausted; he finally reached the shore, where he sat wearily on a"
19527,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,rock and cried to the turtle. But he called to it in vain; the turtle
19528,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"never came, and soon his quavering voice was hushed in death."
19529,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,
19530,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"Before he died, the people of the village gathered about him and"
19531,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,listened to his strange story. Long afterward they told their children
19532,URASCHIMA TARO AND THE TURTLE,"of the young man who, for the love of his parents, left a marvelous"

19549,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19550,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19551,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Once upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no"
19552,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"children. This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered"
19553,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.
19554,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19555,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Now it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King and
19556,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"said, ""Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and"
19557,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"one of your seven Queens shall bear a son."""
19558,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19559,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The King's delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders"
19560,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,for appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event
19561,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,throughout the length and breadth of the land.
19562,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19563,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Meanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace,"
19564,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts'"
19565,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,content on sweetmeats and confectionery.
19566,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19567,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started,"
19568,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the seven Queens sent him a message saying, ""May it please our dearest"
19569,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"lord not to hunt toward the north to-day, for we have dreamed bad"
19570,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"dreams, and fear lest evil should befall you."""
19571,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19572,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes,"
19573,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and set out toward the south; but as luck would have it, although he"
19574,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"hunted diligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the"
19575,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"east or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to"
19576,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"go home empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise and turned to"
19577,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the north. Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had"
19578,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"made up his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden"
19579,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So quickly
19580,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"did it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless, a burning desire to"
19581,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast.
19582,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket,"
19583,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he"
19584,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in
19585,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the midst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till just as he thought to"
19586,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"lay hold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound,"
19587,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"leaped clean over the King's head, and fled toward the mountains."
19588,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed"
19589,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"at full speed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind,"
19590,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"keeping the white hind in view, never drawing bridle until, finding"
19591,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed."
19592,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Before him stood a miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his"
19593,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An"
19594,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"old woman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request"
19595,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"by calling to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came"
19596,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"a maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired,"
19597,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a
19598,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,sight in the wretched hovel.
19599,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19600,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"She held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he drank he"
19601,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl"
19602,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet
19603,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,he had chased so far.
19604,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19605,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Her beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to"
19606,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven"
19607,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage. However, when he"
19608,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"would take no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising"
19609,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"her everything she could desire, she replied, ""Give me the eyes of"
19610,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you"
19611,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"say."""
19612,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19613,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,The King was so carried away by the glamor of the white hind's magical
19614,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"beauty that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven Queens"
19615,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"taken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome"
19616,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"dungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for the hovel"
19617,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"in the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering. But the"
19618,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes,"
19619,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and threading them as a necklace, flung it round her mother's neck,"
19620,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"saying, ""Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, while I am away in"
19621,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the King's palace."""
19622,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19623,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Then she went back with the bewitched Monarch, as his bride, and he"
19624,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"gave her the seven Queens' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven"
19625,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Queens' palace to live in, and the seven Queens' slaves to wait upon"
19626,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,her; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.
19627,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19628,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes"
19629,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest"
19630,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"of the Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very"
19631,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,jealous that the youngest among them should be so fortunate. But
19632,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"though at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved"
19633,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"so useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son."
19634,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud
19635,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had"
19636,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,made a hole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he
19637,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats, which"
19638,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,he divided equally among the seven blind Queens.
19639,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19640,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"As he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three"
19641,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,times every day to play with the little nobles in the town. No one
19642,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full"
19643,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"of funny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to"
19644,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"be rewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some"
19645,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sweetmeats. All these, things he brought home to his seven mothers, as"
19646,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"he loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in"
19647,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death
19648,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,ages before.
19649,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19650,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"At last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and"
19651,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"arrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace"
19652,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"where the white hind lived in wicked splendor and magnificence, he saw"
19653,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets, and, taking"
19654,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"good aim, shot one dead. It came tumbling past the very window where"
19655,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the matter, and"
19656,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,looked out. At the first glance of the handsome young lad standing
19657,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that it was the King's son."
19658,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19659,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"She nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad"
19660,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"without delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her"
19661,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"presence, she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just"
19662,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,shot.
19663,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19664,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""No,"" replied the sturdy lad, ""the pigeon is for my seven blind"
19665,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"mothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did"
19666,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"not bring them food."""
19667,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19668,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""Poor souls!"" cried the cunning white witch. ""Would you not like"
19669,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"to bring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I"
19670,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"faithfully promise to show you where to find them."""
19671,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19672,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Hearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the"
19673,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,pigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother
19674,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"without delay, and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace."
19675,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19676,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""She will not fail to give them,"" said the cruel Queen, ""if you show"
19677,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"her this token on which I have written what I want done."""
19678,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19679,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"So saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these"
19680,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"words inscribed on it, ""Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his"
19681,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"blood like water!"""
19682,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19683,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal"
19684,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"message cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen's mother."
19685,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19686,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,While he was journeying he passed through a town where every one of
19687,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,the inhabitants looked so sad that he could not help asking what was
19688,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,the matter. They told him it was because the King's only daughter
19689,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,refused to marry; therefore when her father died there would be no
19690,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"heir to the throne. They greatly feared she must be out of her mind,"
19691,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,for though every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown
19692,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"to her, she declared she would only marry one who was the son of seven"
19693,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"mothers, and who had ever heard of such a thing? The King, in despair,"
19694,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,had ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the
19695,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Princess; so, much to the lad's impatience, for he was in an"
19696,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"immense hurry to find his mothers' eyes, he was dragged into the"
19697,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,presence-chamber.
19698,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19699,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"No sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and,"
19700,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"turning to the King, said, ""Dear father, this is my choice!"""
19701,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19702,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Never were such rejoicings as these few words produced. The
19703,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven Queens"
19704,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,said he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him recover
19705,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his mothers' eyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story, she asked"
19706,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"to see the potsherd, for she was very learned and clever. Seeing the"
19707,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"treacherous words, she said nothing, but taking another similar-shaped"
19708,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"bit of potsherd, she wrote on it these words, ""Take care of this"
19709,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"lad, giving him all he desires,"" and returned it to the son of seven"
19710,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Queens, who, none the wiser, set off on his quest."
19711,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19712,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Ere long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch's
19713,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"mother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the"
19714,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"message, especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes."
19715,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Nevertheless she took it off and gave it him, saying, ""There are only"
19716,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"thirteen of 'em now, for I lost one last week."""
19717,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19718,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried"
19719,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"home as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes"
19720,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"apiece to the six elder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one,"
19721,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"saying, ""Dearest little mother!--I will be your other eye always!"""
19722,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19723,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"After this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but"
19724,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,when passing by the white Queen's palace he saw some pigeons on the
19725,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"roof. Drawing his bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the"
19726,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"window. The white hind looked out, and lo! there was the King's son"
19727,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,alive and well.
19728,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19729,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"She cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him"
19730,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought"
19731,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"home the thirteen eyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens,"
19732,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,she could hardly restrain her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be
19733,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"charmed with his success, and told him that if he would give her this"
19734,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"pigeon also, she would reward him with the Jogi's wonderful cow, whose"
19735,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom. The"
19736,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as before, she bade"
19737,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"him go and ask her mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd where"
19738,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"on was written, ""Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood"
19739,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"like water!"""
19740,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19741,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"But on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess,"
19742,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"just to tell her how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the"
19743,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"message on the potsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when"
19744,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the lad reached the old hag's hut and asked her for the Jogi's cow,"
19745,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"she could not refuse, but told the boy how to find it; and bidding"
19746,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,him of all things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who
19747,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"kept watch and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she"
19748,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,became too angry at her daughter's foolishness in thus giving away so
19749,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,many good things.
19750,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19751,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Then the lad bravely did as he had been told. He journeyed on and on
19752,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"till he came to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand"
19753,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"demons. They were really frightful to behold, but, plucking up"
19754,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"courage, he whistled a tune as he walked through them, looking neither"
19755,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"to the right nor the left. By and by he came upon the Jogi's cow,"
19756,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"tall, white, and beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of"
19757,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"all the demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed"
19758,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"from her udder, filling the milk-white tank."
19759,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19760,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, ""What do you want"
19761,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"here?"""
19762,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19763,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Then the lad answered, according to the old hag's bidding, ""I want"
19764,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettledrum, and says your"
19765,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"skin is nice and tough."""
19766,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19767,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,Upon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi
19768,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"dares disobey King Indra's command), and, falling at the lad's feet,"
19769,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"cried, ""If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess, even"
19770,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"my beautiful white cow!"""
19771,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19772,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"To this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation,"
19773,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"agreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice"
19774,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,tough skin like the Jogi's elsewhere; so driving the wonderful cow
19775,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"before him, he set off homeward."
19776,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19777,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The seven Queens were delighted to possess so marvelous an animal,"
19778,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"and though they toiled from morning till night making curds and whey,"
19779,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"besides selling milk to the confectioners, they could not use half the"
19780,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"cow gave, and became richer and richer day by day."
19781,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19782,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Seeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with"
19783,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,a light heart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind's
19784,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,palace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons that were
19785,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,cooing on the parapet. One fell dead just beneath the window where
19786,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"the white Queen was sitting. Looking out, she saw the lad, hale and"
19787,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"hearty, standing before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and"
19788,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,spite.
19789,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19790,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"She sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she"
19791,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"heard how kindly her mother had received him, she very nearly had a"
19792,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"fit. However, she dissembled her feelings as well as she could, and,"
19793,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"smiling sweetly, said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her"
19794,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"promise, and that if he would give her this third pigeon, she would"
19795,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"do yet more for him than she had done before, by giving him the"
19796,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"millionfold rice, which ripens in one night."
19797,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19798,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"The lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the"
19799,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"pigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on"
19800,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"which was written, ""Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle"
19801,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his blood like water!"""
19802,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19803,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"But when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming"
19804,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"anxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and"
19805,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"substituted another, on which was written, ""Yet again give this lad"
19806,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"all he requires, for his blood shall be as your blood!"""
19807,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19808,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the"
19809,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"millionfold rice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the"
19810,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"most furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her daughter, she"
19811,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"controlled herself, and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by"

19815,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19816,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"So the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where,"
19817,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"guarded by eighteen millions of demons, the millionfold rice grew."
19818,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"He walked on bravely, looking neither to the right nor left, till"
19819,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"he reached the center and plucked the tallest ear, but as he turned"
19820,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"homeward a thousand sweet voices rose behind him, crying in tenderest"
19821,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"accents, ""Pluck me too! oh, please pluck me too!"" He looked back, and"
19822,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,lo! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!
19823,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19824,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew"
19825,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"uneasy, remembering the message ""His blood shall be as your blood""; so"
19826,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,she set off to see what had happened.
19827,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19828,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Soon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it"
19829,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"was, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste,"
19830,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"formed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood"
19831,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"from her little finger into its mouth, she blew on it, and instantly"
19832,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,the son of seven Queens started up as well as ever.
19833,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19834,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"""Don't you disobey orders again!"" grumbled the old hag, ""or next time"
19835,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"I'll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!"""
19836,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,
19837,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"So the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers,"
19838,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"who, by the aid of the millionfold rice, soon became the richest"
19839,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,people in the kingdom. Then they celebrated their son's marriage to
19840,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp; but the bride was so
19841,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"clever, she would not rest until she had made known her husband to his"
19842,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"father, and punished the wicked white witch. So she made her husband"
19843,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven Queens had
19844,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"lived, and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendor. Then, when"
19845,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King."
19846,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"Now the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven queens, and"
19847,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"his marvelous wealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what"
19848,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,was his astonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a
19849,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"facsimile of his own in every particular! And when his host, richly"
19850,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"attired, led him straight to the private hall, where on royal thrones"
19851,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"sat the seven Queens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was"
19852,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"speechless with surprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw"
19853,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,herself at his feet and told him the whole story. Then the King awoke
19854,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"from his enchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked white hind"
19855,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"who had bewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself. So"
19856,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"she was put to death, and her grave plowed over, and after that the"
19857,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,"seven Queens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody"
19858,ADAPTED BY JOSEPH JACOBS,lived happily.

19896,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,
19897,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"And when the Mouse-deer came into the presence of the King, the King"

19899,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"replied, ""Your slave accuses him of the murder of your slave's"
19900,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"children; your slave would hear the Law of the Land."" Then the King"
19901,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"said unto the Mouse-deer, ""Was it your doing that the Otter's children"
19902,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"were killed?"" The Mouse-deer replied, ""Assuredly it was, but I crave"
19903,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"pardon for doing so."" ""How was it, then,"" said the King, ""that you"
19904,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"came to kill them?"" The Mouse-deer replied, ""Your slave came to kill"

19910,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"""Was it you, Woodpecker,"" said the King, ""who sounded the war-gong?"""
19911,ADAPTED BY WALTER SKEAT,"""Assuredly it was,"" said the Woodpecker,--""forasmuch as your slave saw"

19943,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19944,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,A hungry Jackal once went down to the riverside in search of little
19945,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"crabs, bits of fish, and whatever else he could find for his dinner."
19946,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Now it chanced that in this river there lived a great big Alligator,"
19947,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"who, being also very hungry, would have been extremely glad to eat the"
19948,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,Jackal.
19949,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19950,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"The Jackal ran up and down, here and there, but for a long time could"
19951,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"find nothing to eat. At last, close to where the Alligator was lying"
19952,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"among some tall bulrushes under the clear, shallow water, he saw a"
19953,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,little crab sidling along as fast as his legs could carry him. The
19954,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,Jackal was so hungry that when he saw this he poked his paw into the
19955,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"water to try to catch the crab, when snap! the old Alligator caught"
19956,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"hold of him. ""Oh, dear!"" thought the Jackal to himself, ""what can I"
19957,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"do? This great, big Alligator has caught my paw in his mouth, and in"
19958,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,another minute he will drag me down by it under the water and kill
19959,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"me. My only chance is to make him think he has made a mistake."" So he"
19960,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"called out in a cheerful voice: ""Clever Alligator, clever Alligator,"
19961,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,to catch hold of a bulrush root instead of my paw! I hope you find
19962,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"it very tender."" The Alligator, who was so buried among the bulrushes"
19963,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"that he could hardly see, thought, on hearing this: ""Dear me, how"
19964,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,tiresome! I fancied I had caught hold of the Jackal's paw; but there
19965,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"he is, calling out in a cheerful voice. I suppose I must have seized a"
19966,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"bulrush root instead, as he says,"" and he let the Jackal go."
19967,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19968,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"The Jackal ran away as fast as he could, crying, ""O wise Alligator,"
19969,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"wise Alligator! So you let me go again!"""
19970,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19971,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Then the Alligator was very much vexed, but the Jackal had run away"
19972,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,too far to be caught. Next day the Jackal returned to the riverside to
19973,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,get his dinner as before; but because he was very much afraid of the
19974,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Alligator he called out: ""Whenever I go to look for my dinner, I see"
19975,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,the nice little crabs peeping up through the mud; then I catch them
19976,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"and eat them. I wish I could see one now."""
19977,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19978,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"The Alligator, who was buried in the mud at the bottom of the river,"
19979,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"heard every word. So he popped the little point of his snout above it,"
19980,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"thinking: ""If I do but just show the tip of my nose, the Jackal will"
19981,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"take me for a crab and put in his paw to catch me, and as soon as ever"
19982,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"he does I'll gobble him up."""
19983,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19984,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,But no sooner did the Jackal see the little tip of the Alligator's
19985,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"nose than he called out, ""Aha, my friend! there you are. No dinner for"
19986,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"me in this part of the river, then, I think."" And so saying, he ran"
19987,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,farther on and fished for his dinner a long way from that place.
19988,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"The Alligator was very angry at missing his prey a second time, and"
19989,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,determined not to let him escape again.
19990,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
19991,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"So on the following day, when his little tormentor returned to the"
19992,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"waterside, the Alligator hid himself close to the bank, in order to"
19993,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,catch him if he could. Now the Jackal was rather afraid of going
19994,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"near the river, for he thought, ""Perhaps the Alligator will catch"
19995,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"me to-day."" But yet, being hungry, he did not wish to go without his"
19996,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"dinner; so to make all as safe as he could, he cried: ""Where are all"
19997,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,the little crabs gone? There is not one here and I am so hungry; and
19998,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"generally, even when they are under water, one can see them going"
19999,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"bubble, bubble, bubble, and all the little bubbles go pop! pop! pop!"""
20000,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"On hearing this the Alligator, who was buried in the mud under the"
20001,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"river bank, thought: ""I will pretend to be a little crab."" And he"
20002,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"began to blow, ""Puff, puff, puff! Bubble, bubble, bubble!"" and all the"
20003,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"great bubbles rushed to the surface of the river and burst there, and"
20004,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,the waters eddied round and round like a whirlpool; and there was such
20005,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,a commotion when the huge monster began to blow bubbles in this way
20006,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"that the Jackal saw very well who must be there, and he ran away as"
20007,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"fast as he could, saying, ""Thank you, kind Alligator, thank you;"
20008,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"thank you! Indeed, I would not have come here had I known you were so"
20009,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"close."""
20010,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20011,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,This enraged the Alligator extremely; it made him quite cross to think
20012,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"of being so often deceived by a little Jackal, and he said to himself,"
20013,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"""I will be taken in no more. Next time I will be very cunning."" So"
20014,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,for a long time he waited and waited for the Jackal to return to the
20015,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"riverside; but the Jackal did not come, for he had thought to himself:"
20016,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"""If matters go on in this way, I shall some day be caught and eaten by"
20017,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,the wicked old Alligator. I had better content myself with living
20018,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"on wild figs,"" and he went no more near the river, but stayed in the"
20019,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"jungles and ate wild figs, and roots which he dug up with his paws."
20020,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20021,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"When the Alligator found this out, he determined to try and catch the"
20022,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Jackal on land; so, going under the largest of the wild fig-trees,"
20023,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"where the ground was covered with the fallen fruit, he collected a"
20024,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"quantity of it together, and, burying himself under the great heap,"
20025,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,waited for the Jackal to appear. But no sooner did the cunning little
20026,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,animal see this great heap of wild figs all collected together than
20027,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"he thought, ""That looks very like my friend the Alligator."" And to"
20028,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"discover if it were so or not, he called out: ""The juicy little wild"
20029,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"figs I love to eat always tumble down from the tree, and roll here and"
20030,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,there as the wind drives them; but this great heap of figs is quite
20031,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"still; these cannot be good figs; I will not eat any of them."" ""Ho,"
20032,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"ho!"" thought the Alligator, ""is that all? How suspicious this Jackal"
20033,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"is! I will make the figs roll about a little, then, and when he sees"
20034,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"that, he will doubtless come and eat them."""
20035,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20036,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"So the great beast shook himself, and all the heap of little figs went"
20037,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"roll, roll, roll--some a mile this way, some a mile that, farther than"
20038,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,they had ever rolled before or than the most blustering wind could
20039,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,have driven them.
20040,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20041,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Seeing this, the Jackal scampered away, saying: ""I am so much obliged"
20042,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"to you, Alligator, for letting me know you are there, for indeed I"
20043,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,should hardly have guessed it. You were so buried under that heap of
20044,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"figs."" The Alligator, hearing this, was so angry that he ran after"
20045,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"the Jackal, but the latter ran very, very fast away, too quickly to be"
20046,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,caught.
20047,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20048,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Then the Alligator said to himself: ""I will not allow that little"
20049,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,wretch to make fun of me another time and then run away out of reach;
20050,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"I will show him that I can be more cunning than he fancies."" And early"
20051,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,the next morning he crawled as fast as he could to the Jackal's den
20052,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"(which was a hole in the side of a hill) and crept into it, and hid"
20053,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"himself, waiting for the Jackal, who was out, to return home. But when"
20054,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"the Jackal got near the place, he looked about him and thought: ""Dear"
20055,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,me! the ground looks as if some heavy creature had been walking over
20056,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"it, and here are great clods of earth knocked down from each side of"
20057,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"the door of my den, as if a very big animal had been trying to squeeze"
20058,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,himself through it. I certainly will not go inside until I know that
20059,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"all is safe there."" So he called out: ""Little house, pretty house, my"
20060,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"sweet little house, why do you not give an answer when I call? If"
20061,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"I come, and all is safe and right, you always call out to me. Is"
20062,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"anything wrong, that you do not speak?"""
20063,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20064,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Then the Alligator, who was inside, thought, ""If that is the case I"
20065,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"had better call out, that he may fancy all is right in his house."" And"
20066,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"in as gentle a voice as he could, he said, ""Sweet little Jackal."""
20067,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20068,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"At hearing these words the Jackal felt quite frightened, and thought"
20069,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"to himself: ""So the dreadful old Alligator is there. I must try to"
20070,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"kill him if I can, for if I do not he will certainly catch and kill me"
20071,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"some day."" He therefore answered: ""Thank you, my dear little house. I"

20102,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,There was once a Farmer who suffered much at the hands of a

20104,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"Money-lender rich. At the last, when he hadn't a farthing left, the"

20108,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20109,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""My friend,"" returned the Money-lender piously, ""riches come from"

20111,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20112,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""Thank you, I will!"" replied the simple Farmer; so he prepared three"
20113,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"girdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram."
20114,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20115,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point"
20116,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"out the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake, and went on"
20117,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"his way without a word. Next the Farmer met a yogi, or devotee, and to"
20118,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"him he gave a cake, without receiving any help in return. At last"
20119,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"he came upon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was"

20122,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20123,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""And where are you going?"" asked the poor man, at length."
20124,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20125,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!"""

20131,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20132,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"Then the Farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him,"
20133,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"gave him a conch-shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particular"

20144,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,long the Farmer found himself telling the whole story--all except the
20145,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"secret of blowing the conch, for, with all his simplicity, the Farmer"
20146,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,was not quite such a fool as to tell that.
20147,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20148,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"Nevertheless, the Money-lender determined to have the conch by hook"
20149,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"or by crook, and, as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he"
20150,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,waited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch.
20151,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20152,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every"

20161,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20162,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""Never!"" cried the Farmer; ""that would be the old business all over"

20164,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20165,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"""Not at all!"" replied the wily Money-lender; ""you will have your share!"
20166,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for, if _you_ get all you want,"
20167,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"what can it matter to you if _I_ am rich or poor?"""
20168,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20169,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit"
20170,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"to a Money-lender, the Farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,"
20171,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"no matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the Money-lender"
20172,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"gained double. And the knowledge that this was so, preyed upon the"
20173,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"Farmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of"
20174,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,anything.
20175,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,
20176,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,At last there came a very dry season--so dry that the Farmer's crops
20177,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"withered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a"
20178,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"well to water them, and lo! there was the well, _but the Money-lender"
20179,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,had two_!--two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any Farmer
20180,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"to stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till"
20181,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"at last a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it"
20182,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"loudly, and cried out, ""Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!"" And"
20183,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"so he was, in a twinkling, but the Money-lender, of course, was blind"
20184,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"of both, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells he"
20185,THE FARMER AND THE MONEY-LENDER,"fell into one, and was drowned."

20214,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"But being a much smaller animal, he had made an excellent meal before"

20222,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,away. But when they got there they found to their surprise not only a
20223,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"Jackal, but a Camel who was eating the sugarcanes! This made them very"

20226,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,
20227,ADAPTED BY M. FRERE,"When they had gone, the Jackal said to the Camel, ""We had better go"

20346,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"There was once a very beautiful Indian maiden, who died suddenly on"
20347,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,the day she was to have been married to a handsome young warrior. He
20348,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"was also brave, but his heart was not proof against this loss. From"
20349,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the hour she was buried, there was no more joy or peace for him."
20350,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20351,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"He went often to visit the spot where the women had buried her, and"
20352,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"sat musing there, when, it was thought by some of his friends, he"
20353,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"would have done better to try to amuse himself in the chase, or by"
20354,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,diverting his thoughts in the warpath. But war and hunting had both
20355,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,lost their charms for him. His heart was already dead within him. He
20356,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,pushed aside both his war-club and his bow and arrows.
20357,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20358,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"He had heard the old people say, that there was a path that led to the"
20359,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"land of souls, and he determined to follow it. He accordingly set out,"
20360,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"one morning, after having completed his preparations for the journey."
20361,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,At first he hardly knew which way to go. He was only guided by the
20362,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,tradition that he must go south. For a while he could see no change in
20363,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the face of the country. Forests, and hills, and valleys, and streams"
20364,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,had the same looks which they wore in his native place.
20365,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20366,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"There was snow on the ground when he set out, and it was sometimes"
20367,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,seen to be piled and matted on the thick trees and bushes. At length
20368,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"it began to diminish, and finally disappeared. The forest assumed a"
20369,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"more cheerful appearance, the leaves put forth their buds, and before"
20370,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"he was aware of the completeness of the change, he found himself"
20371,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,surrounded by spring.
20372,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20373,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"He had left behind him the land of snow and ice. The air became mild,"
20374,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,the dark clouds of winter had rolled away from the sky; a pure field
20375,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"of blue was above him, and as he went he saw flowers beside his path,"
20376,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,and heard the songs of birds. By these signs he knew that he was going
20377,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the right way, for they agreed with the traditions of his tribe. At"
20378,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"length he spied a path. It led him through a grove, then up a long and"
20379,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"elevated ridge, on the very top of which he came to a lodge. At the"
20380,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"door stood an old man, with white hair, whose eyes, though deeply"
20381,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"sunk, had a fiery brilliancy. He had a long robe of skins thrown"
20382,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"loosely around his shoulders, and a staff in his hands."
20383,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20384,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,The young Chippewayan began to tell his story; but the venerable
20385,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"chief arrested him before he had proceeded to speak ten words. ""I have"
20386,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"expected you,"" he replied, ""and had just risen to bid you welcome"
20387,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"to my abode. She whom you seek passed here but a few days since, and"
20388,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"being fatigued with her journey, rested herself here. Enter my lodge"
20389,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"and be seated, and I will then satisfy your inquiries, and give you"
20390,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"directions for your journey from this point."" Having done this, they"
20391,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,both issued forth to the lodge door.
20392,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20393,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"""You see yonder gulf,"" said he, ""and the wide-stretching blue plains"
20394,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"beyond. It is the land of souls. You stand upon its borders, and my"
20395,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,lodge is the gate of entrance. But you can not take your body along.
20396,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"Leave it here with your bow and arrows, your bundle, and your dog."
20397,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"You will find them safe on your return."" So saying, he re-entered"
20398,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the lodge, and the freed traveler bounded forward as if his feet had"
20399,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,suddenly been endowed with the power of wings.
20400,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20401,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,But all things retained their natural colors and shapes. The woods and
20402,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"leaves, and streams and lakes, were only more bright and comely than"
20403,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"he had ever witnessed. Animals bounded across his path, with a freedom"
20404,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,and a confidence which seemed to tell him there was no blood shed
20405,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"here. Birds of beautiful plumage inhabited the groves, and sported"
20406,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,in the waters. There was but one thing in which he saw a very unusual
20407,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,effect. He noticed that his passage was not stopped by trees or other
20408,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"objects. He appeared to walk directly through them. They were, in"
20409,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"fact, but the souls or shadows of material trees. He became sensible"
20410,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,that he was in a land of shadows.
20411,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20412,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"When he had traveled half a day's journey, through a country which was"
20413,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"continually becoming more attractive, he came to the banks of a broad"
20414,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"lake, in the center of which was a large and beautiful island. He"
20415,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"found a canoe of shining white stone, tied to the shore. He was now"
20416,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"sure that he had taken the right path, for the aged man had told him"
20417,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,this. There were also shining paddles. He immediately entered the
20418,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"canoe, and took the paddles in his hands, when, to his joy and"
20419,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"surprise, on turning round he beheld the object of his search in"
20420,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"another canoe, exactly its counterpart in everything. She had exactly"
20421,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"imitated his motions, and they were side by side."
20422,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20423,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,They at once pushed out from shore and began to cross the lake. Its
20424,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"waves seemed to be rising, and at a distance looked ready to swallow"
20425,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,them up; but just as they entered the whitened edge of them they
20426,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"seemed to melt away, as if they were but the images of waves. But no"
20427,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"sooner was one wreath of foam passed, than another, more threatening"
20428,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"still, arose."
20429,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20430,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"Thus they were in perpetual fear; and what added to it, was the"
20431,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"_clearness of the water_, through which they could see heaps of beings"
20432,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"who had perished before, and whose bones lay strewed on the bottom of"
20433,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the lake. The Master of Life had, however, decreed to let them pass,"
20434,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,for the actions of neither of them had been bad. But they saw many
20435,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,others struggling and sinking in the waves. Old and young of all ages
20436,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"and ranks, were there: some passed and some sank. It was only the"
20437,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,little children whose canoes seemed to meet no waves.
20438,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20439,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"At length every difficulty was gone, as in a moment, and they both"
20440,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,leaped out on the happy island. They felt that the very air was food.
20441,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,It strengthened and nourished them. They wandered together over the
20442,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"blissful fields, where every thing was formed to please the eye and"
20443,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the ear. There were no tempests--there was no ice, no chilly winds--no"
20444,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,one shivered for the want of warm clothes: no one suffered hunger--no
20445,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,one mourned for the dead. They saw no graves. They heard of no wars.
20446,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,There was no hunting of animals; for the air itself was their food.
20447,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"Gladly would the young warrior have remained there forever, but he was"
20448,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"obliged to go back for his body. He did not see the Master of Life,"
20449,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,but he heard his voice in a soft breeze.
20450,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,
20451,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"""Go back,"" said this voice, ""to the land from whence you came. Your"
20452,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"time has not yet come. The duties for which I made you, and which"
20453,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"you are to perform, are not yet finished. Return to your people, and"
20454,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,accomplish the duties of a good man. You will be the ruler of your
20455,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,tribe for many days. The rules you must observe will be told you by my
20456,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"messenger, who keeps the gate. When he surrenders back your body, he"
20457,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,will tell you what to do. Listen to him and you shall afterward rejoin
20458,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"the spirit, which you must now leave behind. She is accepted and will"
20459,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"be ever here, as young and as happy as she was when I first called her"
20460,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"from the land of snows."" When this voice ceased, the narrator awoke."
20461,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"It was all the fabric of a dream, and he was still in the bitter land"
20462,ADAPTED BY H. R. SCHOOLCRAFT,"of snows, and hunger, and tears."

20470,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20471,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20472,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"There was once among the Marshpees, a small tribe who have their"
20473,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"hunting-grounds on the shores of the Great Lake, near the Cape of"
20474,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"Storms, a woman whose name was Awashanks. She was rather silly and"
20475,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,very idle. For days together she would sit doing nothing. Then she was
20476,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,so ugly and ill-shaped that not one of the youths of the village would
20477,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,have aught to say to her by way of courtship or marriage. She squinted
20478,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"very much; her face was long and thin, her nose excessively large and"
20479,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"humped, her teeth crooked and projecting, her chin almost as sharp"
20480,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"as the bill of a loon, and her ears as large as those of a deer."
20481,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"Altogether she was a very odd and strangely formed woman, and wherever"
20482,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,she went she never failed to excite much laughter and derision among
20483,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,those who thought that ugliness and deformity were fit subjects for
20484,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,ridicule.
20485,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20486,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"Though so very ugly, there was one faculty she possessed in a more"
20487,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,remarkable degree than any woman of the tribe. It was that of singing.
20488,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"Nothing, unless such could be found in the land of spirits, could"
20489,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,equal the sweetness of her voice or the beauty of her songs. Her
20490,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"favorite place of resort was a small hill, a little removed from the"
20491,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"river of her people, and there, seated beneath the shady trees, she"
20492,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,would while away the hours of summer with her charming songs. So
20493,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"beautiful and melodious were the things she uttered that, by the time"
20494,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"she had sung a single sentence, the branches above her head would be"
20495,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"filled with the birds that came thither to listen, the thickets around"
20496,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"her would be crowded with beasts, and the waters rolling beside her"
20497,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"would be alive with fishes, all attracted by the sweet sounds. From"
20498,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"the minnow to the porpoise, from the wren to the eagle, from the snail"
20499,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"to the lobster, from the mouse to the mole--all hastened to the spot"
20500,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,to listen to the charming songs of the hideous Marshpee maiden.
20501,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20502,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,Among the fishes which repaired every night to the vicinity of
20503,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"the Little Hillock, which was the chosen resting-place of the ugly"
20504,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"songstress, was the great chief of the trouts, a tribe of fish"
20505,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,inhabiting the river near by. The chief was of a far greater size than
20506,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"the people of his nation usually are, being as long as a man and quite"
20507,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,as broad.
20508,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20509,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,Of all the creatures which came to listen to the singing of Awashanks
20510,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,none appeared to enjoy it so highly as the chief of the trouts. As
20511,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"his bulk prevented him from approaching so near as he wished, he,"
20512,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"from time to time, in his eagerness to enjoy the music to the best"
20513,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"advantage, ran his nose into the ground, and thus worked his way"
20514,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,a considerable distance into the land. Nightly he continued his
20515,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"exertions to approach the source of the delightful sounds he heard,"
20516,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"till at length he had plowed out a wide and handsome channel, and so"
20517,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"effected his passage from the river to the hill, a distance extending"
20518,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,an arrow's-flight. Thither he repaired every night at the commencement
20519,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"of darkness, sure to meet the maiden who had become so necessary to"
20520,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"his happiness. Soon he began to speak of the pleasure he enjoyed, and"
20521,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,to fill the ears of Awashanks with fond protestations of his love and
20522,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"affection. Instead of singing to him, she now began to listen to his"
20523,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,voice. It was something so new and strange to her to hear the tones of
20524,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"love and courtship, a thing so unusual to be told she was beautiful,"
20525,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"that it is not wonderful her head was turned by the new incident, and"
20526,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,that she began to think the voice of her lover the sweetest she had
20527,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,ever heard. One thing marred their happiness. This was that the trout
20528,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"could not live upon land, nor the maiden in the water. This state of"
20529,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,things gave them much sorrow.
20530,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20531,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"They had met one evening at the usual place, and were discoursing"
20532,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"together, lamenting that two who loved each other so, should be doomed"
20533,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"always to live apart, when a man appeared close to Awashanks. He asked"
20534,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,the lovers why they seemed to be so sad.
20535,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20536,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,The chief of the trouts told the stranger the cause of their sorrow.
20537,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20538,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"""Be not grieved nor hopeless,"" said the stranger, when the chief"
20539,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"had finished. ""The impediments can be removed. I am the spirit who"
20540,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"presides over fishes, and though I cannot make a man or woman of a"
20541,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"fish, I can make them into fish. Under my power Awashanks shall become"
20542,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"a beautiful trout."""
20543,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,
20544,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,With that he bade the girl follow him into the river. When they had
20545,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,waded in some little depth he took up some water in his hand and
20546,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"poured it on her head, muttering some words, of which none but himself"
20547,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,knew the meaning. Immediately a change took place in her. Her body
20548,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"took the form of a fish, and in a few moments she was a complete"
20549,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,trout. Having accomplished this transformation the spirit gave her
20550,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"to the chief of the trouts, and the pair glided off into the deep"
20551,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"and quiet waters. She did not, however, forget the land of her birth."
20552,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"Every season, on the same night as that upon which her disappearance"
20553,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"from her tribe had been wrought, there were to be seen two trouts of"
20554,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,enormous size playing in the water off the shore. They continued
20555,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"their visits till the palefaces came to the country, when, deeming"
20556,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,themselves to be in danger from a people who paid no reverence to the
20557,THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH,"spirits of the land, they bade it adieu forever."

20567,THE STAR WIFE,In the days when the buffalo raced and thundered over the earth and
20568,THE STAR WIFE,"the stars danced and sang in the sky, a brave young hunter lived on"
20569,THE STAR WIFE,the bank of Battle River. He was fond of the red flowers and the blue
20570,THE STAR WIFE,sky; and when the rest of the Indians went out to hunt in waistcloths
20571,THE STAR WIFE,"of skin he put on his fringed leggings all heavy with blue beads, and"
20572,THE STAR WIFE,"painted red rings and stripes on his face, till he was as gay as the"

20574,THE STAR WIFE,wore a red swan's feather on his head.
20575,THE STAR WIFE,
20576,THE STAR WIFE,"One day, when High-feather was out with his bow and arrows, he came on"
20577,THE STAR WIFE,"a little beaten trail that he had never seen before, and he followed"

20579,THE STAR WIFE,"where he had started. It came from nowhere, and it went to nowhere."
20580,THE STAR WIFE,
20581,THE STAR WIFE,"""What sort of animal has made this?"" he said. And he lay down in the"
20582,THE STAR WIFE,"middle of the ring to think, looking up into the blue sky."
20583,THE STAR WIFE,
20584,THE STAR WIFE,"While he lay thinking, he saw a little speck up above him in the sky,"
20585,THE STAR WIFE,"and thought it was an eagle. But the speck grew bigger, and sank down"
20586,THE STAR WIFE,"and down, till he saw it was a great basket coming down out of the"
20587,THE STAR WIFE,sky. He jumped up and ran back to a little hollow and lay down to hide
20588,THE STAR WIFE,in a patch of tall red flowers. Then he peeped out and saw the basket
20589,THE STAR WIFE,come down to the earth and rest on the grass in the middle of the
20590,THE STAR WIFE,ring. Twelve beautiful maidens were leaning over the edge of the
20591,THE STAR WIFE,"basket. They were not Indian maidens, for their faces were pink and"
20592,THE STAR WIFE,"white, and their long hair was bright red-brown like a fox's fur, and"
20593,THE STAR WIFE,their clothes were sky-blue and floating light as cobwebs.
20594,THE STAR WIFE,
20595,THE STAR WIFE,The maidens jumped out of the basket and began to dance round and
20596,THE STAR WIFE,"round the ring-trail, one behind the other, drumming with their"

20599,THE STAR WIFE,

20602,THE STAR WIFE,
20603,THE STAR WIFE,"The maidens were frightened, and ran to the basket and jumped in,"

20607,THE STAR WIFE,"The young man went home to his wigwam, and his mother roasted buffalo"
20608,THE STAR WIFE,"meat for his dinner; but he could not eat, and he could not think of"
20609,THE STAR WIFE,anything but the twelve beautiful maidens. His mother begged him to
20610,THE STAR WIFE,"tell her what the matter was; and at last he told her, and said he"
20611,THE STAR WIFE,would never be happy till he brought one of the maidens home to be his
20612,THE STAR WIFE,wife.
20613,THE STAR WIFE,
20614,THE STAR WIFE,"""Those must be the Star-people,"" said his mother, who was a great"
20615,THE STAR WIFE,"magician--the prairie was full of magic in those days, before the"
20616,THE STAR WIFE,"white man came and the buffalo went. ""You had better take an Indian"
20617,THE STAR WIFE,"girl for your wife. Don't think any more of the Star-maidens, or you"
20618,THE STAR WIFE,"will have much trouble."""
20619,THE STAR WIFE,
20620,THE STAR WIFE,"""I care little how much trouble I have, so long as I get a Star-maiden"
20621,THE STAR WIFE,"for my wife,"" he said; ""and I am going to get one, if I have to wait"
20622,THE STAR WIFE,"till the world ends."""
20623,THE STAR WIFE,
20624,THE STAR WIFE,"""If you must, you must,"" said his mother."
20625,THE STAR WIFE,
20626,THE STAR WIFE,So next morning she sewed a bit of gopher's fur on to his feather;
20627,THE STAR WIFE,and he ate a good breakfast of buffalo meat and tramped away over
20628,THE STAR WIFE,the prairie to the dancing ring. As soon as he came into the ring he
20629,THE STAR WIFE,turned into a gopher; but there were no gophers' holes there for him
20630,THE STAR WIFE,"to hide in, so he had to lie in the grass and wait."
20631,THE STAR WIFE,
20632,THE STAR WIFE,"Presently he saw a speck up in the sky, and the speck grew larger and"
20633,THE STAR WIFE,"larger till it became a basket, and the basket came down and down till"
20634,THE STAR WIFE,it rested on the earth in the middle of the ring.
20635,THE STAR WIFE,
20636,THE STAR WIFE,"The eldest maiden put her head over the edge and looked all around,"
20637,THE STAR WIFE,north and east and south and west.
20638,THE STAR WIFE,
20639,THE STAR WIFE,"""There is no man here,"" she said. So they all jumped out to have their"
20640,THE STAR WIFE,dance. But before they came to the beaten ring the youngest maiden
20641,THE STAR WIFE,"spied the gopher, and called out to her sisters to look at it."
20642,THE STAR WIFE,
20643,THE STAR WIFE,"""Away! away!"" cried the eldest maiden. ""No gopher would dare to come"
20644,THE STAR WIFE,"on our dancing ground. It is a conjuror in disguise!"""
20645,THE STAR WIFE,
20646,THE STAR WIFE,So she took her youngest sister by the arm and pulled her away to the
20647,THE STAR WIFE,"basket, and they all jumped in and the basket went sailing up into"
20648,THE STAR WIFE,the sky before High-feather could get out of his gopher skin or say a
20649,THE STAR WIFE,word.
20650,THE STAR WIFE,
20651,THE STAR WIFE,The young man went home very miserable; but when his mother heard what
20652,THE STAR WIFE,"had happened she said: ""It is a hard thing you want to do; but if you"
20653,THE STAR WIFE,"must, you must. To-night I will make some fresh magic, and you can try"
20654,THE STAR WIFE,"again to-morrow."""
20655,THE STAR WIFE,
20656,THE STAR WIFE,Next morning High-feather asked for his breakfast; but his mother
20657,THE STAR WIFE,"said, ""You must not have any buffalo meat, or it will spoil the magic."
20658,THE STAR WIFE,You must not eat anything but the wild strawberries you find on the
20659,THE STAR WIFE,"prairie as you go."""
20660,THE STAR WIFE,
20661,THE STAR WIFE,Then she sewed a little bit of a mouse's whisker on to his red
20662,THE STAR WIFE,"feather; and he tramped away across the prairie, picking wild"
20663,THE STAR WIFE,"strawberries and eating them as he went, till he came to the dancing"
20664,THE STAR WIFE,"ring. As soon as he was inside the ring he turned into a little mouse,"
20665,THE STAR WIFE,and made friends with the family of mice that lived in a hole under
20666,THE STAR WIFE,the grass; and the mother mouse promised to help him all she could.
20667,THE STAR WIFE,
20668,THE STAR WIFE,They had not waited long when the basket came dropping down out of
20669,THE STAR WIFE,"the sky. The eldest sister put her head over the edge, and looked all"
20670,THE STAR WIFE,"around, north and west and south and east and down on the ground."
20671,THE STAR WIFE,
20672,THE STAR WIFE,"""There is no man here,"" she said, ""and I do not see any gopher; but"
20673,THE STAR WIFE,"you must be very careful."""
20674,THE STAR WIFE,
20675,THE STAR WIFE,"So they all got out of the basket, and began to dance round the ring,"
20676,THE STAR WIFE,drumming and singing as they went. But when they came near the mouse's
20677,THE STAR WIFE,"nest the eldest sister held up her hand, and they stopped dancing and"
20678,THE STAR WIFE,held their breath. Then she tapped on the ground and listened.
20679,THE STAR WIFE,
20680,THE STAR WIFE,"""It does not sound so hollow as it did,"" she said, ""The mice have a"
20681,THE STAR WIFE,"visitor."""
20682,THE STAR WIFE,
20683,THE STAR WIFE,"And she tapped again, and called out, ""Come and show yourselves, you"
20684,THE STAR WIFE,"little traitors, or we will dig you up!"""
20685,THE STAR WIFE,
20686,THE STAR WIFE,"But the mother mouse had made another door to her nest, just outside"
20687,THE STAR WIFE,"the ring, working very fast with all her toes; and while the maidens"
20688,THE STAR WIFE,were looking for her inside the ring she came out at the other door
20689,THE STAR WIFE,with all her children and scampered away across the prairie.
20690,THE STAR WIFE,
20691,THE STAR WIFE,The maidens turned round and ran after them; all but the youngest
20692,THE STAR WIFE,"sister, who did not want any one to be killed; and High-feather came"
20693,THE STAR WIFE,"out of the hole and turned himself into what he was, and caught her by"
20694,THE STAR WIFE,the arm.
20695,THE STAR WIFE,
20696,THE STAR WIFE,"""Come home and marry me,"" he said, ""and dance with the Indian maidens;"
20697,THE STAR WIFE,"and I will hunt for you, and my mother will cook for you, and you will"
20698,THE STAR WIFE,"be much happier than up in the sky."""
20699,THE STAR WIFE,
20700,THE STAR WIFE,"Her sisters came rushing round her, and begged her to go back home to"
20701,THE STAR WIFE,"the sky with them; but she looked into the young man's eyes, and said"
20702,THE STAR WIFE,she would go with him wherever he went. So the other maidens went
20703,THE STAR WIFE,"weeping and wailing up into the sky, and High-feather took his"
20704,THE STAR WIFE,Star-wife home to his tent on the bank of the Battle River.
20705,THE STAR WIFE,
20706,THE STAR WIFE,High-feather's mother was glad to see them both; but she whispered in
20707,THE STAR WIFE,"his ear: ""You must never let her out of your sight if you want to keep"
20708,THE STAR WIFE,"her; you must take her with you everywhere you go."""
20709,THE STAR WIFE,
20710,THE STAR WIFE,"And he did so. He took her with him every time he went hunting, and"
20711,THE STAR WIFE,"he made her a bow and arrows, but she would never use them; she would"
20712,THE STAR WIFE,pick wild strawberries and gooseberries and raspberries as they went
20713,THE STAR WIFE,"along, but she would never kill anything; and she would never eat"
20714,THE STAR WIFE,anything that any one else had killed. She only ate berries and
20715,THE STAR WIFE,crushed corn.
20716,THE STAR WIFE,
20717,THE STAR WIFE,"One day, while the young man's wife was embroidering feather stars on"
20718,THE STAR WIFE,"a dancing-cloth, and his mother was gossiping in a tent at the end"
20719,THE STAR WIFE,"of the village, a little yellow bird flew in and perched on"
20720,THE STAR WIFE,"High-feather's shoulder, and whispered in his ear:"
20721,THE STAR WIFE,
20722,THE STAR WIFE,"""There is a great flock of wild red swans just over on Loon Lake. If"
20723,THE STAR WIFE,you come quickly and quietly you can catch them before they fly away;
20724,THE STAR WIFE,"but do not tell your wife, for red swans cannot bear the sight of a"
20725,THE STAR WIFE,"woman, and they can tell if one comes within a mile of them."""
20726,THE STAR WIFE,
20727,THE STAR WIFE,High-feather had never seen or heard of a red swan before; all the red
20728,THE STAR WIFE,"feathers he wore he had had to paint. He looked at his wife, and as"
20729,THE STAR WIFE,she was sewing busily and looking down at her star embroidering he
20730,THE STAR WIFE,thought he could slip away and get back before she knew he had gone.
20731,THE STAR WIFE,But as soon as he was out of sight the little yellow bird flew in and
20732,THE STAR WIFE,"perched on her shoulder, and sang her such a beautiful song about her"
20733,THE STAR WIFE,sisters in the sky that she forgot everything else and slipped out
20734,THE STAR WIFE,"and ran like the wind, and got to the dancing ring just as her sisters"
20735,THE STAR WIFE,"came down in their basket. Then they all gathered round her, and"
20736,THE STAR WIFE,begged her to go home with them.
20737,THE STAR WIFE,
20738,THE STAR WIFE,"But she only said, ""High-feather is a brave man, and he is very good"
20739,THE STAR WIFE,"to me, and I will never leave him."""
20740,THE STAR WIFE,
20741,THE STAR WIFE,"When they saw they could not make her leave her husband, the eldest"
20742,THE STAR WIFE,"sister said: ""If you must stay, you must. But just come up for an"
20743,THE STAR WIFE,"hour, to let your father see you, because he has been mourning for you"
20744,THE STAR WIFE,"ever since you went away."""
20745,THE STAR WIFE,
20746,THE STAR WIFE,"The Star-wife did not wish to go, but she wanted to see her father"
20747,THE STAR WIFE,"once more, so she got into the basket and it sailed away up into the"
20748,THE STAR WIFE,"sky. Her father was very glad to see her, and she was very glad to"
20749,THE STAR WIFE,"see him, and they talked and they talked till the blue sky was getting"
20750,THE STAR WIFE,gray. Then she remembered that she ought to have gone home long
20751,THE STAR WIFE,before.
20752,THE STAR WIFE,
20753,THE STAR WIFE,"""Now I must go back to my husband,"" she said."
20754,THE STAR WIFE,
20755,THE STAR WIFE,"""That you shall never do!"" said her father."
20756,THE STAR WIFE,
20757,THE STAR WIFE,And he shut her up in a white cloud and said she should stay there
20758,THE STAR WIFE,till she promised never to go back to the prairie. She begged to be
20759,THE STAR WIFE,"let out, but it was no use."
20760,THE STAR WIFE,
20761,THE STAR WIFE,Then she began to weep; and she wept so much that the cloud began to
20762,THE STAR WIFE,"weep too, and it was weeping itself quite away. So her father saw she"
20763,THE STAR WIFE,would go down to the earth in rain if he kept her in the cloud any
20764,THE STAR WIFE,"longer, and he let her out."
20765,THE STAR WIFE,
20766,THE STAR WIFE,"""What must I do for you,"" he said, ""to make you stay with us here and"
20767,THE STAR WIFE,"be happy?"""
20768,THE STAR WIFE,
20769,THE STAR WIFE,"""I will not stay here,"" she said, ""unless my husband comes and lives"
20770,THE STAR WIFE,"here too."""
20771,THE STAR WIFE,
20772,THE STAR WIFE,"""I will send for him at once,"" said her father. So he sent the basket"
20773,THE STAR WIFE,"down empty, and it rested in the middle of the dancing ring."
20774,THE STAR WIFE,
20775,THE STAR WIFE,Now when High-feather reached Loon Lake he found it covered with red
20776,THE STAR WIFE,"swans. He shot two with one arrow, and then all the rest flew away."
20777,THE STAR WIFE,"He picked up the two swans and hurried back to his tent, and there lay"
20778,THE STAR WIFE,"the dancing-cloth with the feather stars on it half finished, but no"
20779,THE STAR WIFE,"wife could he see. He called her, but she did not answer. He rushed"
20780,THE STAR WIFE,"out, with the two red swans still slung round his neck and hanging"
20781,THE STAR WIFE,"down his back, and ran to the dancing ring, but nobody was there."
20782,THE STAR WIFE,
20783,THE STAR WIFE,"""I will wait till she comes back,"" he said to himself, ""if I have to"
20784,THE STAR WIFE,"wait till the world ends."" So he threw himself down on the grass and"
20785,THE STAR WIFE,lay looking up at the stars till he went to sleep.
20786,THE STAR WIFE,
20787,THE STAR WIFE,"Early in the morning he heard a rustling on the grass, and when he"
20788,THE STAR WIFE,opened his eyes he saw the great basket close beside him. He jumped
20789,THE STAR WIFE,"up, with the two red swans still slung round his neck, and climbed"
20790,THE STAR WIFE,into the basket. There was nobody there; and when he began to climb
20791,THE STAR WIFE,out again he found that the basket was half way up to the sky. It went
20792,THE STAR WIFE,"up and up, and at last it came into the Star-country, where his wife"
20793,THE STAR WIFE,was waiting for him. Her father gave them a beautiful blue tent to
20794,THE STAR WIFE,"live in, and High-feather was happy enough for a while; but he soon"
20795,THE STAR WIFE,"grew tired of the cloud-berries that the Star-people ate, and he"
20796,THE STAR WIFE,"longed to tramp over the solid green prairie, so he asked his wife's"
20797,THE STAR WIFE,father to let him take her back to the earth.
20798,THE STAR WIFE,
20799,THE STAR WIFE,"""No,"" said the Star-man, ""because then I should never see her again."
20800,THE STAR WIFE,"If you stay with us you will soon forget the dull old earth."""
20801,THE STAR WIFE,
20802,THE STAR WIFE,The young man said nothing; but he put on the wings of one of the red
20803,THE STAR WIFE,"swans, and he put the other red swan's wings on his wife, and they"
20804,THE STAR WIFE,leapt over the edge of the Star-country and flew down through the air
20805,THE STAR WIFE,"to the prairie, and came to the tent where High-feather's mother was"
20806,THE STAR WIFE,mourning for them; and there was a great feast in the village because
20807,THE STAR WIFE,they had come back safe and sound. The Star-wife finished embroidering
20808,THE STAR WIFE,her dancing-cloth that day; and whenever the Indians danced she danced
20809,THE STAR WIFE,with them. She never went back to the Star-maidens' dancing ring;
20810,THE STAR WIFE,"but she still lived on berries and corn, because she would never kill"
20811,THE STAR WIFE,"anything,--except one thing, and that was the little yellow bird. It"
20812,THE STAR WIFE,"flew into the tent one day when High-feather had his back turned,"
20813,THE STAR WIFE,and began to whisper into the Star-wife's ear; but it never came to
20814,THE STAR WIFE,trouble her again.

20828,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20829,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20830,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Caliph Charid, of Bagdad, was reclining on his divan one pleasant"
20831,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"afternoon, smoking his long pipe and sipping coffee from a handsome"
20832,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"dish which a slave was holding for him, when his Grand Vizier, Mansor,"
20833,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,entered and told him of a peddler in the court below whose wares might
20834,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"interest him. The Caliph, being in an affable state of mind, summoned"
20835,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"the peddler, who, delighted with the opportunity, displayed all the"
20836,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"treasures of his pack. There were pearls, rings, silks, and many other"
20837,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"rich things. The Caliph selected something for himself, a handsome"
20838,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"present for the Vizier, and another for the Vizier's wife."
20839,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20840,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Just as the peddler was putting the things back into his box, the"
20841,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,Caliph noticed a small drawer and asked what it contained.
20842,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20843,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""Only something of no value, which I picked up in a street of Mecca,"""
20844,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,the peddler replied. He thereupon opened the drawer and showed the
20845,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Caliph a small box, containing a black powder and a scroll written in"
20846,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,characters which neither the Caliph nor his Grand Vizier could make
20847,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,out. The Caliph immediately decided that he wanted this strange
20848,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"scroll, and the peddler was persuaded to part with it for a trifle."
20849,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,Then the Vizier was asked to find some one to decipher its meaning.
20850,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20851,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Near the mosque lived a man called Selim, who was so learned that"
20852,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,he knew every language in the world. When the Vizier brought him to
20853,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"interpret the scroll, the Caliph said to him:"
20854,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20855,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""They tell me that you are a scholar and can read all languages. If"
20856,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"you can decipher what is written here, I shall know that it is true,"
20857,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"and will give you a robe of honor; but if you fail, I shall have you"

20859,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20860,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Selim prostrated himself at the feet of the Caliph, and then took the"
20861,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,scroll. He had not looked at it long when he exclaimed:

20863,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""My lord and master, I hope to die if this is not Latin."""
20864,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20865,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""Well, if so, let us hear what it says,"" the Caliph impatiently"
20866,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,answered. Selim at once began:
20867,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20868,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""Let him who finds this box praise Allah. If he snuffs the powder it"
20869,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"contains, at the same time pronouncing the word 'Matabor,' he will be"

20871,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"language of all animals. When he wishes to return to his own form,"
20872,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"let him bow to the east three times, repeating the word 'Matabor.'"
20873,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"But remember if, while he is bird or beast, he should laugh, the magic"

20875,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20876,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,The Caliph was delighted with the knowledge of Selim. He made him
20877,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"a splendid present, and told him to keep the secret. When he had"
20878,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"dismissed the learned man, he turned to the Grand Vizier, and"
20879,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,expressed a wish to try the powder.
20880,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20881,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"""Come to-morrow morning early,"" said he, ""and we will go together to"

20884,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"The Vizier came as he was ordered, and they left the palace without"

20886,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"storks were often seen, and to this place they presently came. A grave"
20887,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"and stately stork was hunting for frogs, while another flew about and"

20893,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"The Caliph replied that the stork had always interested him, and he"

20897,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,
20898,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Together they cried ""Matabor,"" and instantly their beards disappeared,"
20899,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,and feathers covered their bodies; their necks stretched out long and

20916,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"Yellowlegs stepped out, and began to pose most gracefully. The Caliph"
20917,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"and the Vizier watched her, until she stood on one foot and spread"
20918,THE STORY OF CALIPH STORK,"her wings; then they both, at the same time, burst into such peals of"

21141,THE MOST FRUGAL OF MEN,decided that the son should go and inquire whether the master in
21142,THE MOST FRUGAL OF MEN,economic science would take pupils. An exchange of presents being a

21200,THE MOON-CAKE,"that, if he did not like so small a moon, he should have one that was"

21212,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21213,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21214,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,Once there was an old woman who lived on what she got by wile from her
21215,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,relatives and neighbors. Her husband's brother lived alone with his
21216,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"only son, in a house near hers, and when the son brought home a wife"
21217,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,the old woman went to call on the bride. During the call she inquired
21218,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"of the bride whether she had not, since her arrival in the house,"
21219,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,heard a scratching at night among the boxes containing her wedding
21220,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,outfit. The bride said she had not. A few days later the old woman
21221,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"came again, and during the visit the bride remarked that, before the"
21222,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"matter was mentioned, she had heard no scratching among her boxes, but"
21223,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"that since that time she had listened for it, and had heard it every"
21224,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"night. The old woman advised her to look carefully after her clothing,"
21225,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"saying that there were evidently many mice in the house, and that she"
21226,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,would be likely at any time to find her best garments nibbled into
21227,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"shreds. The old woman knew there was no cat in the house, but she"
21228,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"inquired whether there was one, and on hearing that there was not, she"
21229,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"offered to lend the young woman her own black-and-white cat, saying"
21230,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,that it would soon extirpate all the mice. The bride accepted the
21231,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"loan, and the old woman brought the cat, and left it in the bride's"
21232,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"apartment. After a few hours the cat disappeared, and the bride,"
21233,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"supposing it to have gone home, made no search for it. It did, indeed,"
21234,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"go home, and the old woman secretly disposed of it; but several days"
21235,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"later she came to the young woman and said that, when she lent the"
21236,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"cat, her house had been free from mice, but that, as soon as the cat"
21237,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"was gone, the mice came and multiplied so fast that now everything was"
21238,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"overrun by them, and she would be obliged to take the cat home again."
21239,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,The young woman told her that the cat went away the same day that it
21240,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"came, and she had supposed it had gone home. The old woman said it had"
21241,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"not, and that nothing could compensate her for the loss of it, for she"
21242,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,had reared it herself; that there was never before seen such a cat for
21243,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"catching mice; that a cat, spotted as that one was, was seldom found;"
21244,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,and that it was of the rare breed which gave rise to the common
21245,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,saying:
21246,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21247,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"""A coal-black cat, with snowy loins,"
21248,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"Is worth its weight in silver coins."""
21249,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21250,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,and that the weight of her cat was two hundred ounces.
21251,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21252,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,The young woman was greatly surprised by this estimate of the value of
21253,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"the lost cat, and went to her father-in-law and related all that had"
21254,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"occurred. The father-in-law, knowing the character of the old woman,"
21255,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"could neither eat nor sleep, so harassed was he by the expectation"
21256,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,that she would worry his daughter-in-law till the two hundred ounces
21257,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"of silver should be paid. The young woman, being a new-comer, thought"
21258,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"but lightly of the matter, till the old woman came again and again to"
21259,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,make mention of the cat. When it became apparent that she must defend
21260,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"herself, the young woman asked her father-in-law if he had ever lent"
21261,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,anything to the old woman; and when he said he could not remember
21262,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"having lent anything, she begged him to think carefully, and see if"
21263,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"he could not recall the loan of a tool, a dish, or a fagot. He finally"
21264,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"recollected that he had lent to her an old wooden ladle, but he said"
21265,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"it originally cost but a few farthings, and was certainly not worth"
21266,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,speaking about.
21267,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21268,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,The next time the old woman came to dun for the amount due for her
21269,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"cat, the young woman asked her to return the borrowed ladle. The old"
21270,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,woman said that the ladle was old and valueless; that she had allowed
21271,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"the children to play with it, and that they had dropped it in the"
21272,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"dirt, where it had lain until she had picked it up and used it for"
21273,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"kindlings. The bride responded: ""You expect to enrich yourself and"
21274,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,your family by means of your cat. I and my family also want money.
21275,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"Since you cannot give back the ladle, we will both go before the"
21276,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,magistrate and present our cases. If your cat is adjudged to be worth
21277,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,more than my ladle I will pay you the excess; and if my ladle be worth
21278,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"more than your cat, then you must pay me."" Being sure that the cat"
21279,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"would, by any judge, be considered of greater value than the ladle,"
21280,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"the old woman agreed to the proposition, and the two went before the"
21281,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"magistrate. The young woman courteously gave precedence to the elder,"
21282,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,and allowed her to make the accusation. The old woman set forth her
21283,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"case, and claimed two hundred ounces of silver as a compensation for"
21284,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"the loss of the cat. When she had concluded her statement, the judge"
21285,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,called on the young woman for her defense. She said she could not
21286,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"disprove the statement, but that the claim was offset by a ladle that"
21287,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,had been borrowed by the plaintiff. There was a common saying:
21288,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21289,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"""In the moon overhead, at its full, you can see"
21290,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"The trunk, branch and leaf of a cinnamon tree."""
21291,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21292,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,A branch from this tree had one night been blown down before her
21293,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"father-in-law's door, and he had had a ladle made from the wood."
21294,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"Whatever the ladle was put into never diminished by use. Whether wine,"
21295,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"oil, rice, or money, the bulk remained the same if no ladle beside"
21296,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"this one were used in dipping it. A foreign inn-keeper, hearing of"
21297,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"this ladle, came and offered her father-in-law three thousand ounces"
21298,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"of silver for it, but the offer was refused. And this ladle was the"
21299,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,one that the plaintiff had borrowed and destroyed.
21300,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,
21301,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"The magistrate, on hearing this defense, understood that the cat had"
21302,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"been a pretext for extortion, and decided that the two claims offset"
21303,THE LADLE THAT FELL FROM THE MOON,"each other, so that no payment was due from either one."

21311,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21312,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21313,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"There was once a family consisting of a father, his three sons, and"
21314,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"his two daughters-in-law. The two daughters-in-law, wives of the two"
21315,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"elder sons, had but recently been brought into the house, and were"
21316,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,both from one village a few miles away. Having no mother-in-law
21317,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"living, they were obliged to appeal to their father-in-law whenever"
21318,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"they wished to visit their former homes, and as they were lonesome"
21319,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,and homesick they perpetually bothered the old man by asking leave of
21320,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,absence.
21321,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21322,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"Vexed by these constant petitions, he set himself to invent a method"
21323,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"of putting an end to them, and at last gave them leave in this wise:"
21324,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"""You are always begging me to allow you to go and visit your mothers,"
21325,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,and thinking that I am very hard-hearted because I do not let you go.
21326,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"Now you may go, but only upon condition that when you come back you"
21327,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,will each bring me something I want. The one shall bring me some
21328,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"fire wrapped in paper, and the other some wind in a paper. Unless you"
21329,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"promise to bring me these, you are never to ask me to let you go home;"
21330,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"and if you go, and fail to get these for me, you are never to come"
21331,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"back."""
21332,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21333,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"The old man did not suppose that these conditions would be accepted,"
21334,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"but the girls were young and thoughtless, and in their anxiety to"
21335,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,get away did not consider the impossibility of obtaining the articles
21336,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"required. So they made ready with speed, and in great glee started off"
21337,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"on foot to visit their mothers. After they had walked a long distance,"
21338,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,chatting about what they should do and whom they should see in their
21339,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"native village, the high heel of one of them slipped from under her"
21340,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"foot, and she fell down. Owing to this mishap both stopped to adjust"
21341,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"the misplaced footgear, and while doing this the conditions under"
21342,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"which alone they could return to their husbands came to mind, and they"
21343,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,began to cry.
21344,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21345,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,While they sat there crying by the roadside a young girl came riding
21346,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,along from the fields on a water buffalo. She stopped and asked them
21347,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"what was the matter, and whether she could help them. They told her"
21348,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,she could do them no good; but she persisted in offering her sympathy
21349,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"and inviting their confidence, till they told their story, and then"
21350,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,she at once said that if they would go home with her she would show
21351,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,them a way out or their trouble. Their case seemed so hopeless to
21352,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"themselves, and the child was so sure of her own power to help them,"
21353,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"that they finally accompanied her to her father's house, where she"
21354,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,showed them how to comply with their father-in-law's demand.
21355,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21356,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,For the first a paper lantern only would be needed. When lighted it
21357,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"would be a fire, and its paper surface would compass the blaze, so"
21358,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"that it would truly be ""some fire wrapped in paper."" For the second a"
21359,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"paper fan would suffice. When flapped, wind would issue from it, and"
21360,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"the ""wind wrapped in paper"" could thus be carried to the old man."
21361,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21362,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"The two young women thanked the wise child, and went on their way"
21363,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"rejoicing. After a pleasant visit to their old homes, they took a"
21364,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"lantern and a fan, and returned to their father-in-law's house. As"
21365,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,soon as he saw them he began to vent his anger at their light regard
21366,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"for his commands, but they assured him that they had perfectly"
21367,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"obeyed him, and showed him that what they had brought fulfilled the"
21368,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"conditions prescribed. Much astonished, he inquired how it was that"
21369,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"they had suddenly become so astute, and they told him the story of"
21370,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"their journey, and of the little girl who had so opportunely come"
21371,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,to their relief. He inquired whether the little girl was already
21372,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"betrothed, and, finding that she was not, engaged a go-between to see"
21373,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,if he could get her for a wife for his youngest son.
21374,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21375,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"Having succeeded in securing the girl as a daughter-in-law, he brought"
21376,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"her home, and told all the rest of the family that as there was"
21377,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"no mother in the house, and as this girl had shown herself to be"
21378,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"possessed of extraordinary wisdom, she should be the head of the"
21379,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,household.
21380,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21381,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"The wedding festivities being over, the sons of the old man made ready"
21382,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"to return to their usual occupations on the farm; but, according to"
21383,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"their father's order, they came to the young bride for instructions."
21384,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,She told them that they were never to go to or from the fields
21385,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,empty-handed. When they went they must carry fertilizers of some sort
21386,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"for the land, and when they returned they must bring bundles of sticks"
21387,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"for fuel. They obeyed, and soon had the land in fine condition, and so"
21388,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,much fuel gathered that none need be bought. When there were no
21389,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"more sticks, roots, or weeds to bring; she told them to bring stones"
21390,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"instead; and they soon accumulated an immense pile of stones, which"
21391,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,were heaped in a yard near their house.
21392,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21393,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"One day an expert in the discovery of precious stones came along,"
21394,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,and saw in this pile a block of jade of great value. In order to get
21395,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"possession of this stone at a small cost, he undertook to buy the"
21396,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"whole heap, pretending that he wished to use it in building. The"
21397,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"little head of the family asked an exorbitant price for them, and, as"
21398,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"he could not induce her to take less, he promised to pay her the sum"
21399,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"she asked, and to come two days later to bring the money and to remove"
21400,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,the stones. That night the girl thought about the reason for the
21401,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"buyer's being willing to pay so large a sum for the stones, and"
21402,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,concluded that the heap must contain a gem. The next morning she sent
21403,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"her father-in-law to invite the buyer to supper, and she instructed"
21404,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,the men of her family in regard to his entertainment. The best of wine
21405,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"was to be provided, and the father-in-law was to induce him to talk of"
21406,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"precious stones, and to cajole him into telling in what way they were"
21407,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,to be distinguished from other stones.
21408,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21409,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"The head of the family, listening behind a curtain, heard how the"
21410,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,valuable stone in her heap could be discovered. She hastened to find
21411,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"and remove it from the pile; and, when her guest had recovered from"
21412,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"the effect of the banquet, he saw that the value had departed from"
21413,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"his purchase. He went to negotiate again with the seller, and she"
21414,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,conducted the conference with such skill that she obtained the price
21415,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"originally agreed upon for the heap of stones, and a large sum besides"
21416,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,for the one in her possession.
21417,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21418,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"The family, having become wealthy, built an ancestral hall of fine"
21419,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"design and elaborate workmanship, and put the words ""No Sorrow"" as an"
21420,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"inscription over the entrance. Soon after, a mandarin passed that way,"
21421,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"and, noticing this remarkable inscription, had his sedan-chair set"
21422,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"down, that he might inquire who were the people that professed to have"
21423,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"no sorrow. He sent for the head of the family, was much surprised"
21424,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"on seeing so young a woman thus appear, and remarked: ""Yours is a"
21425,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"singular family. I have never before seen one without sorrow, nor one"
21426,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,with so young a head. I will fine you for your impudence. Go and weave
21427,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"me a piece of cloth as long as this road."""
21428,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21429,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"""Very well,"" responded the little woman; ""so soon as your Excellency"
21430,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"shall have found the two ends of the road, and informed me as to the"
21431,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"number of feet in its length, I will at once begin the weaving."""
21432,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21433,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"Finding himself at fault, the mandarin added, ""And I also fine you as"
21434,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"much oil as there is water in the sea."""
21435,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21436,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"""Certainly,"" responded the woman; ""as soon as you shall have measured"
21437,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"the sea, and sent me correct information as to the number of gallons,"
21438,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"I will at once begin to press out the oil from my beans."""
21439,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21440,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"""Indeed,"" said the mandarin, ""since you are so sharp, perhaps you can"
21441,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"penetrate my thoughts. If you can, I will fine you no more. I hold"
21442,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,this pet quail in my hand; now tell me whether I mean to squeeze it to
21443,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"death, or to let it fly in the air."""
21444,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,
21445,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"""Well,"" said the woman, ""I am an obscure commoner, and you are a famed"
21446,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"magistrate; if you are no more knowing than I, you have no right to"
21447,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,fine me at all. Now I stand with one foot on one side my threshold and
21448,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,the other foot on the other side; tell me whether I mean to go in or
21449,THE YOUNG HEAD OF THE FAMILY,"come out. If you cannot guess my riddle, you should not require me to"

21479,A DREADFUL BOAR,his way. The old woman stuck the needles thickly over the lower half
21480,A DREADFUL BOAR,"of her door, on its outer side, and then she went on crying. Just then"
21481,A DREADFUL BOAR,"a man came along with a basket of crabs, heard her lamentations, and"
21482,A DREADFUL BOAR,"stopped to inquire what ailed her. She told him, and he said he knew"
21483,A DREADFUL BOAR,"no help for her, but he would do the best he could for her by giving"
21484,A DREADFUL BOAR,"her half his crabs. The old woman put the crabs in her water-jar,"
21485,A DREADFUL BOAR,"behind her door, and again sat down and cried. A farmer soon came"
21486,A DREADFUL BOAR,"along from the fields, leading his ox, and he also asked the cause of"
21487,A DREADFUL BOAR,her distress and heard her sad story. He said he was sorry he could
21488,A DREADFUL BOAR,"not think of any way of preventing the evil she expected, but that he"
21489,A DREADFUL BOAR,"would leave his ox to stay all night with her, as it might be a sort"
21490,A DREADFUL BOAR,"of company for her in her loneliness. She led the ox into her cabin,"
21491,A DREADFUL BOAR,"tied it to the head of her bedstead, gave it some straw, and then"
21492,A DREADFUL BOAR,cried again.
21493,A DREADFUL BOAR,
21494,A DREADFUL BOAR,"A courier, returning on horseback from a neighboring town, next passed"
21495,A DREADFUL BOAR,"her door, and dismounted to inquire what troubled her. Having heard"
21496,A DREADFUL BOAR,"her tale, he said he would leave his horse to stay with her, and make"
21497,A DREADFUL BOAR,"the ox more contented. So she tied the horse to the foot of her bed,"
21498,A DREADFUL BOAR,"and, thinking how surely evil was coming upon her with the night,"
21499,A DREADFUL BOAR,she burst out crying anew. A boy just then came along with a
21500,A DREADFUL BOAR,"snapping-turtle that he had caught, and stopped to ask what had"
21501,A DREADFUL BOAR,"happened to her. On learning the cause of her weeping, he said it was"
21502,A DREADFUL BOAR,"of no use to contend against sprites, but that he would give her his"
21503,A DREADFUL BOAR,"snapping-turtle as a proof, of his sympathy. She took the turtle, tied"
21504,A DREADFUL BOAR,"it in front of her bedstead, and continued to cry."
21505,A DREADFUL BOAR,
21506,A DREADFUL BOAR,"Some men who were carrying mill-stones then came along, inquired"
21507,A DREADFUL BOAR,"into her trouble, and expressed their compassion by giving her a"
21508,A DREADFUL BOAR,"mill-stone, which they rolled into her back yard. A little later a man"
21509,A DREADFUL BOAR,"arrived carrying hoes and pickax, and asked her why she was crying so"
21510,A DREADFUL BOAR,"hard. She told him her grief, and he said he would gladly help her if"
21511,A DREADFUL BOAR,"he could, but he was only a well-digger, and could do nothing for her"
21512,A DREADFUL BOAR,other than to dig her a well. She pointed out a place in the middle of
21513,A DREADFUL BOAR,"her back yard, and he went to work and quickly dug a well."
21514,A DREADFUL BOAR,
21515,A DREADFUL BOAR,"On his departure the old woman cried again, until a paper-seller came"
21516,A DREADFUL BOAR,"and inquired what was the matter. When she had told him, he gave her"
21517,A DREADFUL BOAR,"a large sheet of white paper, as a token of pity, and she laid it"
21518,A DREADFUL BOAR,smoothly over the mouth of the well.
21519,A DREADFUL BOAR,
21520,A DREADFUL BOAR,"Nightfall came; the old woman shut and barred her door, put her"
21521,A DREADFUL BOAR,"granddaughter snugly on the wall-side of the bed, and then lay down"
21522,A DREADFUL BOAR,"beside her, to await the foe."
21523,A DREADFUL BOAR,
21524,A DREADFUL BOAR,"At midnight the Boar came, and threw himself against the door to break"
21525,A DREADFUL BOAR,"it in. The needles wounded him sorely, so that when he had gained"
21526,A DREADFUL BOAR,"an entrance he was heated and thirsty, and went to the water-jar to"
21527,A DREADFUL BOAR,"drink. When he thrust in his snout the crabs attacked him, clung to"
21528,A DREADFUL BOAR,"his bristles and pinched his ears, till he rolled over and over to"
21529,A DREADFUL BOAR,disencumber himself. Then in a rage he approached the front of the
21530,A DREADFUL BOAR,"bed, but the snapping-turtle nipped his tail, and made him retreat"
21531,A DREADFUL BOAR,"under the feet of the horse, who kicked him over to the ox, who tossed"
21532,A DREADFUL BOAR,him back to the horse; and thus beset he was glad to escape to the
21533,A DREADFUL BOAR,"back yard to take a rest, and to consider the situation. Seeing a"
21534,A DREADFUL BOAR,"clean paper spread on the ground, he went to lie upon it, and fell"
21535,A DREADFUL BOAR,"into the well. The old woman heard the fall, rushed out, rolled the"
21536,A DREADFUL BOAR,"mill-stone down on him, and crushed him."

21551,KING KOJATA,
21552,KING KOJATA,
21553,KING KOJATA,"King Kojata ruled over a mighty kingdom, and was beloved by his"
21554,KING KOJATA,"subjects; but because he had no heir to his crown, both he and the"
21555,KING KOJATA,"Queen lamented. Once, while traveling through his territories, he came"
21556,KING KOJATA,to a well that was filled to the brim with clear cold water; and being
21557,KING KOJATA,"very thirsty, he stopped to drink. On the top of the water floated a"
21558,KING KOJATA,"golden vessel, which the King attempted to seize; but just as his hand"
21559,KING KOJATA,"touched it, away it floated to the other side of the well. He went"
21560,KING KOJATA,"around to where the vessel rested and tried again, with the same"
21561,KING KOJATA,result. Every time the King touched the basin it glided from his
21562,KING KOJATA,"grasp. At last, losing patience, he gave up trying to seize the"
21563,KING KOJATA,"vessel, and bending over the well, he began to drink. His long beard"
21564,KING KOJATA,"had fallen into the water, and when he had slaked his thirst and"
21565,KING KOJATA,"attempted to rise, he found himself held fast by it. After vainly"
21566,KING KOJATA,"pulling and jerking for some time, he looked down into the water and"
21567,KING KOJATA,"saw a hideous face grinning at him. Its eyes were green and shining,"
21568,KING KOJATA,"its teeth showed from ear to ear, and it held him by the beard with"
21569,KING KOJATA,"two bony claws. In horror, the king tried to extricate himself, but a"
21570,KING KOJATA,terrible voice came from the depths of the well:
21571,KING KOJATA,
21572,KING KOJATA,"""You cannot get away, King Kojata, so do not make me pull your beard"
21573,KING KOJATA,too hard. There is something at the palace of which you do not know;
21574,KING KOJATA,"promise to give it to me, and I will release you."""
21575,KING KOJATA,
21576,KING KOJATA,The King did not know of anything that could have arrived at the
21577,KING KOJATA,palace during his absence worth the discomfort he was experiencing;
21578,KING KOJATA,"so he very readily gave his promise, and was freed. When he had shaken"
21579,KING KOJATA,"the water from his beard, he looked in the well for the ugly monster"
21580,KING KOJATA,"which had held him captive, but he was nowhere to be seen. Summoning"
21581,KING KOJATA,"his attendants, he at once set out for home, where he arrived in a few"
21582,KING KOJATA,days. The people along the way hailed him with delight; and when he
21583,KING KOJATA,"reached the palace, the Queen led him to the royal chamber and showed"
21584,KING KOJATA,him a beautiful son that had been born during his absence. His joy was
21585,KING KOJATA,so great that he forgot all else; but after a time he recalled with
21586,KING KOJATA,"horror his compact with the monster of the well, and the meaning was"
21587,KING KOJATA,all plain to him. The thought of what he had promised haunted him day
21588,KING KOJATA,"and night, and the fear that something would happen to his little son"
21589,KING KOJATA,"tortured him. But as days and months passed, and the little Prince"
21590,KING KOJATA,"grew more beautiful all the time, the King at last forgot his fears"
21591,KING KOJATA,and became happy once more.
21592,KING KOJATA,
21593,KING KOJATA,"Years went by without anything happening to disturb his peace of mind,"
21594,KING KOJATA,"and the Prince grew to be a beautiful youth, who was the joy and pride"
21595,KING KOJATA,"of the King and Queen. One day he went with the hunters to the forest,"
21596,KING KOJATA,"and while pursuing a wild boar, became separated from them. He got"
21597,KING KOJATA,"farther and farther away from his companions, and at last found"
21598,KING KOJATA,himself alone in a dark part of the wood where he never before had
21599,KING KOJATA,"been. Not knowing in which direction his path lay, he called again and"
21600,KING KOJATA,"again to the hunters. At last a hoarse voice answered him, and from"
21601,KING KOJATA,the hollow trunk of a lime-tree appeared a hideous man with green eyes
21602,KING KOJATA,and terrible teeth.
21603,KING KOJATA,
21604,KING KOJATA,"""I've waited for you a long time, Prince Milan,"" said he."
21605,KING KOJATA,
21606,KING KOJATA,"""Who on earth may you be?"" asked the Prince."
21607,KING KOJATA,
21608,KING KOJATA,"""Your father will tell you who I am. Just give my greetings to his"
21609,KING KOJATA,"Majesty, and tell him that I am ready to claim the debt he owes me."""
21610,KING KOJATA,
21611,KING KOJATA,The green-eyed man then disappeared into the hollow tree from which he
21612,KING KOJATA,"came; and when the Prince reached home, he related his experience to"
21613,KING KOJATA,"his father. The King turned white, and cried:"
21614,KING KOJATA,
21615,KING KOJATA,"""At last, it has come!"" Then he explained to the Prince what had"
21616,KING KOJATA,"occurred at the well, and added, ""Now my happiness is at an end, for"
21617,KING KOJATA,"you, my son, will be taken from me."""
21618,KING KOJATA,
21619,KING KOJATA,"The Prince told the King not to despair, for though he might go"
21620,KING KOJATA,"away, he was certain to return to him. His father provided him with a"
21621,KING KOJATA,"handsome horse with golden stirrups, and the Queen gave him a cross to"
21622,KING KOJATA,"wear about his neck. When he had said farewell to his unhappy parents,"
21623,KING KOJATA,he mounted his horse and rode for two days without stopping.
21624,KING KOJATA,
21625,KING KOJATA,On the third day he came to a lake on whose smooth surface thirty
21626,KING KOJATA,"ducks were swimming, while spread about upon the grass were thirty"
21627,KING KOJATA,"white garments. The Prince dismounted, and taking up one of the"
21628,KING KOJATA,"garments, seated himself behind a bush and waited to see what would"
21629,KING KOJATA,happen. The ducks dived under the water and disported themselves for a
21630,KING KOJATA,"time, then came ashore and putting on the little white garments, they"
21631,KING KOJATA,"became beautiful maidens, and disappeared. But there was one little"
21632,KING KOJATA,"duck, that remained on the lake and swam about in the most distracted"
21633,KING KOJATA,"manner, uttering piteous cries. The Prince came from behind the bush"
21634,KING KOJATA,and the little duck begged him to give back her garment. He had no
21635,KING KOJATA,sooner done so than before him stood the loveliest maiden he had ever
21636,KING KOJATA,seen.
21637,KING KOJATA,
21638,KING KOJATA,"""Thank you, Prince Milan, for restoring my garment,"" said she. ""My"
21639,KING KOJATA,"name is Hyacinthia, and I am one of the thirty daughters of a King"
21640,KING KOJATA,"of the Underworld, to whose castle I will lead you, for he has waited"
21641,KING KOJATA,"long for you. Approach him on your knees and do not fear him, for I"
21642,KING KOJATA,"will be there to help you, whatever happens."""
21643,KING KOJATA,
21644,KING KOJATA,"She tapped her little foot on the ground, which opened; and they were"
21645,KING KOJATA,"immediately transported to the palace of her father in the Underworld,"
21646,KING KOJATA,which was carved from a single carbuncle. When his eyes became
21647,KING KOJATA,"accustomed to the radiant light, the Prince saw the magician of the"
21648,KING KOJATA,lime-tree sitting on a dazzling throne. His green eyes looked out from
21649,KING KOJATA,"under a golden crown, and his hideous claws clutched the air with"
21650,KING KOJATA,"rage when he saw the Prince. Remembering what the maiden had told him,"
21651,KING KOJATA,Prince Milan walked boldly up to the throne and knelt at the feet of
21652,KING KOJATA,"the magician, who cursed in a voice that shook the Underworld. As"
21653,KING KOJATA,"the youth was not at all frightened, the magician at last stopped"
21654,KING KOJATA,"swearing. Laughing at his courage, he welcomed him to his palace,"
21655,KING KOJATA,and showed him to a beautiful chamber which he was to occupy. On the
21656,KING KOJATA,following day he sent for him and said;
21657,KING KOJATA,
21658,KING KOJATA,"""You are very brave, Prince Milan, but you must pay the penalty for"
21659,KING KOJATA,keeping me waiting so long for you. To-night build me a palace of gold
21660,KING KOJATA,"and marble, with windows of crystal, and about it the most beautiful"
21661,KING KOJATA,"gardens in the world, or tomorrow I shall cut off your head."""
21662,KING KOJATA,
21663,KING KOJATA,The Prince went back to his chamber and sadly awaited his doom. That
21664,KING KOJATA,"evening a small bee flew in through his window, and as soon as it"
21665,KING KOJATA,"entered the room it became Hyacinthia. ""Why are you sad, Prince"
21666,KING KOJATA,"Milan?"" she asked. He told her of her father's impossible command and"
21667,KING KOJATA,"added, ""Naturally, I am not happy at the thought of losing my head."""
21668,KING KOJATA,
21669,KING KOJATA,"""Do not be distressed about that,"" said she, ""but trust to me."" In the"
21670,KING KOJATA,"morning he looked out of the window and saw a wonderful marble palace,"
21671,KING KOJATA,with a roof of gold.
21672,KING KOJATA,
21673,KING KOJATA,"When the magician beheld it, he exclaimed, ""You have accomplished a"
21674,KING KOJATA,"great wonder, but I cannot let you off so easily. To-morrow I will"
21675,KING KOJATA,"place my thirty daughters in a row, and if you cannot tell me which"
21676,KING KOJATA,"one is the youngest, you will lose your head."""
21677,KING KOJATA,
21678,KING KOJATA,"The Prince, however, was not cast down at this, for he thought he"
21679,KING KOJATA,would have no trouble in recognizing Hyacinthia. That evening the
21680,KING KOJATA,little bee entered the room and told him that this task was quite as
21681,KING KOJATA,"difficult as the first, because the sisters were all exactly alike."
21682,KING KOJATA,"""But you will know me,"" said she, ""by a little fly which you will"
21683,KING KOJATA,"discover on my cheek."""
21684,KING KOJATA,
21685,KING KOJATA,"The next day the magician summoned him to his presence, and showed him"
21686,KING KOJATA,the thirty daughters standing in a row. The Prince passed before them
21687,KING KOJATA,"twice, without daring to choose; but he saw the little fly on the pink"
21688,KING KOJATA,cheek of one of the maidens.
21689,KING KOJATA,
21690,KING KOJATA,"""This is Hyacinthia!"" exclaimed he. The magician was greatly"
21691,KING KOJATA,"astonished; but not yet satisfied, he required of the Prince still"
21692,KING KOJATA,another task.
21693,KING KOJATA,
21694,KING KOJATA,"""If, before this candle burns to the bottom,"" said he, ""you make me"
21695,KING KOJATA,"a pair of boots reaching to my knees, I will let you go; but if you"
21696,KING KOJATA,"fail, you will lose your head."""
21697,KING KOJATA,
21698,KING KOJATA,"""Then we must fly, for I love you dearly,"" said Hyacinthia, when the"
21699,KING KOJATA,"Prince had told her of this new task. She breathed on the window-pane,"
21700,KING KOJATA,"and straightway it was covered with frost; then, leading Prince Milan"
21701,KING KOJATA,"from the chamber, she locked the door, and they fled through the"
21702,KING KOJATA,passage by which they had entered the Underworld. Beside the smooth
21703,KING KOJATA,"lake his horse was still grazing, and mounting it, they were borne"
21704,KING KOJATA,swiftly away.
21705,KING KOJATA,
21706,KING KOJATA,"When the magician sent for the Prince to come to him, the frozen"
21707,KING KOJATA,"breath replied to the messengers, and so delayed the discovery of his"
21708,KING KOJATA,escape. At last the magician lost patience and ordered the door burst
21709,KING KOJATA,"open. The frozen breath mocked at him, and he hastened in pursuit of"
21710,KING KOJATA,the fugitives.
21711,KING KOJATA,
21712,KING KOJATA,"""I hear the sound of horses' feet behind us,"" said Hyacinthia. The"
21713,KING KOJATA,"Prince dismounted, and putting his ear to the ground, answered, ""Yes,"
21714,KING KOJATA,"they are near."" Hyacinthia thereupon changed herself into a river, and"
21715,KING KOJATA,"the Prince became a bridge, and his horse a blackbird. Their pursuers,"
21716,KING KOJATA,"no longer finding their footprints, were obliged to return to the"
21717,KING KOJATA,"magician, who cursed them, and again sent them forth."
21718,KING KOJATA,
21719,KING KOJATA,"""I hear the sound of horses' feet behind us,"" again said Hyacinthia."
21720,KING KOJATA,"The Prince put his ear to the earth and said, ""Yes, they are nearly"
21721,KING KOJATA,"upon us."" Thereupon Hyacinthia changed herself, the Prince and the"
21722,KING KOJATA,"horse, all into a dense forest in which many paths crossed, so"
21723,KING KOJATA,that the followers were bewildered; and they again returned to the
21724,KING KOJATA,magician.
21725,KING KOJATA,
21726,KING KOJATA,"""I hear horses' feet behind us,"" said Hyacinthia a third time; and"
21727,KING KOJATA,this time it was the magician himself. Hyacinthia took the little
21728,KING KOJATA,"cross from the neck of the Prince, and changed herself into a church,"
21729,KING KOJATA,"the Prince into a monk, and the horse into the belfry; so that when"
21730,KING KOJATA,"the magician came up he lost all trace of them, and was obliged to"
21731,KING KOJATA,return to the Underworld in great chagrin.
21732,KING KOJATA,
21733,KING KOJATA,"When he had departed, the Prince and Hyacinthia mounted the horse and"
21734,KING KOJATA,rode till they came to a beautiful town.
21735,KING KOJATA,
21736,KING KOJATA,"""We must not enter,"" said she, ""for we may not come out again."""
21737,KING KOJATA,"But the Prince would not take her advice, and insisted upon passing"
21738,KING KOJATA,through the gates.
21739,KING KOJATA,
21740,KING KOJATA,"""Then,"" sadly replied the maiden, ""when the King and Queen of the town"
21741,KING KOJATA,"come out to meet you, do not kiss the little child which they will"
21742,KING KOJATA,"lead by the hand, or you will forget me and never come back. As for"
21743,KING KOJATA,"me, I will become a milestone and wait for you here."""
21744,KING KOJATA,
21745,KING KOJATA,It was all as Hyacinthia had said. The King and Queen came out to
21746,KING KOJATA,"greet him, and when the lovely little child ran up to him for a"
21747,KING KOJATA,"caress, he kissed its pretty face and forgot Hyacinthia."
21748,KING KOJATA,
21749,KING KOJATA,"The first and second day went by; and when the third day came,"
21750,KING KOJATA,"Hyacinthia wept, and became a little blue flower growing by the"
21751,KING KOJATA,"roadside. An old man came along, and digging up the flower carried it"
21752,KING KOJATA,home with him and planted it in his garden. He watered and tended it
21753,KING KOJATA,"carefully, and one day the little flower became a beautiful maiden."
21754,KING KOJATA,
21755,KING KOJATA,"""Why did you not leave me to die by the roadside?"" she asked, and told"
21756,KING KOJATA,the old man her story.
21757,KING KOJATA,
21758,KING KOJATA,"""To-morrow is Prince Milan's wedding day,"" said the old man."
21759,KING KOJATA,
21760,KING KOJATA,"Hyacinthia at once dried her tears, and presented herself at the"
21761,KING KOJATA,"palace, dressed like a peasant. She went to the cook and asked to"
21762,KING KOJATA,be allowed to make the wedding cake. The cook was so struck with her
21763,KING KOJATA,beauty that he could not refuse the request. When the guests were all
21764,KING KOJATA,"seated about the table, Prince Milan was called upon to cut the cake."
21765,KING KOJATA,"As soon as he had done so, out flew two beautiful doves, which circled"
21766,KING KOJATA,about his head.
21767,KING KOJATA,
21768,KING KOJATA,"""Dear mate,"" cried one of the doves, ""do not leave me as Prince Milan"
21769,KING KOJATA,"left Hyacinthia."""
21770,KING KOJATA,
21771,KING KOJATA,"The Prince, who suddenly recollected all he had forgotten, ran from"
21772,KING KOJATA,the room and at the door found Hyacinthia and his horse awaiting him.
21773,KING KOJATA,"They mounted and rode swiftly away to the kingdom of King Kojata,"
21774,KING KOJATA,"where the King and Queen received them with tears of joy, and they all"
21775,KING KOJATA,lived in happiness to the end of their days.

21786,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"everything she could get, and a stepdaughter whom she neglected and"
21787,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"ill treated. In the mother's eyes the daughter had no faults, while"
21788,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"the stepdaughter was always blamed, and, try as she might, the poor"
21789,THE STORY OF KING FROST,girl never could please. So unhappy was she made that her eyes were
21790,THE STORY OF KING FROST,often red from weeping. The sight of her tear-stained face only
21791,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"angered the stepmother the more, and caused her to say to the girl's"
21792,THE STORY OF KING FROST,father:
21793,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21794,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"""Send her away, old man. My eyes are tired of the sight of her, and my"

21797,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"The father begged to have his daughter remain, but the shrew was"
21798,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"determined to be rid of her, and gave him no peace. At last, when he"
21799,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"could gainsay her no longer, he placed his daughter in a sledge and"
21800,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"drove her to the open fields. Here he left her, with nothing to shield"
21801,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"her from the bitter cold. Kissing her good-by, he drove away, not"
21802,THE STORY OF KING FROST,daring to look back at Her.
21803,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21804,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"Left alone by her father, the girl wandered across the bleak fields to"
21805,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"the edge of the forest, where she sat down under a fir-tree and"
21806,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"wept. A crackling sound caused her to look up, and she saw King Frost"
21807,THE STORY OF KING FROST,springing from one tree to another. When he reached the fir-tree
21808,THE STORY OF KING FROST,he jumped down beside her with a bound. Snapping his fingers in her
21809,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"lovely face, he asked:"

21811,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"""Do you know who I am? I will tell you. I am King Frost."""
21812,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21813,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"""Hail to you, great King!"" smiled the maiden. ""Have you come for me?"""
21814,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21815,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"""Are you warm, fair maiden?"" he asked in answer."
21816,THE STORY OF KING FROST,

21834,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21835,THE STORY OF KING FROST,The gentle girl's patience and uncomplaining endurance caused King
21836,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"Frost to take pity on her suffering. He arrayed her in a robe,"
21837,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"embroidered in silver and gold, and decked her with sparkling"
21838,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"diamonds. She glittered and shone, and was dazzling to behold. Then"
21839,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"placing her in his sleigh, he wrapped her in furs; and six white"
21840,THE STORY OF KING FROST,horses bore them swiftly away.

21842,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"The stepmother, at home, was baking pancakes for the girl's funeral"

21845,THE STORY OF KING FROST,when the little dog barked:

21860,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21861,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"The woman beat the dog, then coaxed it with more pancakes; but the"
21862,THE STORY OF KING FROST,blows could not terrify it nor food persuade. It barked always the

21864,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"room, followed by the radiant stepdaughter, in a dress that dazzled"
21865,THE STORY OF KING FROST,them with its beauty.
21866,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21867,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"As soon as the stepmother recovered from her astonishment, she"

21870,THE STORY OF KING FROST,"the old woman cautioned. The father left the girl as he was bidden,"
21871,THE STORY OF KING FROST,and returned to his home.

21873,THE STORY OF KING FROST,She was not long alone when King Frost came by.

21884,THE STORY OF KING FROST,and she was dead.
21885,THE STORY OF KING FROST,
21886,THE STORY OF KING FROST,The mother waited for her daughter's return until she became

22346,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"First he ate some lettuces and some French beans, and then he ate"

22349,BY BEATRIX POTTER,

22356,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22357,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,"

22360,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22361,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I"

22363,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his"
22364,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new."
22365,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22366,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs"
22367,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great"

22369,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22370,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the"
22371,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"top of Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket"
22372,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"behind him; and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It"
22373,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so"
22374,BY BEATRIX POTTER,much water in it.
22375,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22376,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed,"
22377,BY BEATRIX POTTER,perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over
22378,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"carefully, looking under each."
22379,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22380,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Presently Peter sneezed--""Kerty-schoo!"" Mr. McGregor was after him"
22381,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of"
22382,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr."
22383,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his"
22384,BY BEATRIX POTTER,work.
22385,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22386,BY BEATRIX POTTER,Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with
22387,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was"
22388,BY BEATRIX POTTER,very damp with sitting in that can.
22389,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22390,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"After a time he began to wander about, going lippity-lippity--not very"
22391,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"fast, and looking all around."
22392,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22393,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room"
22394,BY BEATRIX POTTER,for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
22395,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22396,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying"
22397,BY BEATRIX POTTER,peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to
22398,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not"
22399,BY BEATRIX POTTER,answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.
22400,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22401,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he"
22402,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where"
22403,BY BEATRIX POTTER,Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some
22404,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her"
22405,BY BEATRIX POTTER,tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away
22406,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin,"
22407,BY BEATRIX POTTER,little Benjamin Bunny.
22408,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22409,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"He went back toward the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,"
22410,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scratch."
22411,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But, presently, as nothing"
22412,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped"
22413,BY BEATRIX POTTER,over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back
22414,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"was turned toward Peter, and beyond him was the gate!"
22415,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22416,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started"
22417,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some"
22418,BY BEATRIX POTTER,black-currant bushes.
22419,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22420,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not"
22421,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood"
22422,BY BEATRIX POTTER,outside the garden.
22423,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22424,BY BEATRIX POTTER,Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow
22425,BY BEATRIX POTTER,to frighten the blackbirds.
22426,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22427,BY BEATRIX POTTER,Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to
22428,BY BEATRIX POTTER,the big fir-tree.
22429,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22430,BY BEATRIX POTTER,He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the

22432,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22433,BY BEATRIX POTTER,His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his
22434,BY BEATRIX POTTER,clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter
22435,BY BEATRIX POTTER,had lost in a fortnight!
22436,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22437,BY BEATRIX POTTER,I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
22438,BY BEATRIX POTTER,
22439,BY BEATRIX POTTER,"His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a"

22462,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",coming from the town.
22463,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22464,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""Look!"" said one of them. ""Did you ever see such stupid fellows? They"
22465,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","are walking when one of them might be riding."""
22466,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22467,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","When the miller heard this he bade the boy get up on the ass, while he"
22468,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",tramped along merrily by its side. Soon they came to a number of old
22469,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",men standing by the side of the road talking together.
22470,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22471,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""Look at that,"" said one of them, ""Look at that young rascal riding,"
22472,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","while his poor father has to walk. Get down, you idle fellow, and let"
22473,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","your father ride."""
22474,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22475,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","Upon this the son got down from the ass, and the miller took his"
22476,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",place. They had not gone very far when they met two women coming home
22477,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",from market.
22478,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22479,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""You lazy old man!"" they cried at once. ""How dare you ride when your"
22480,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","poor little boy is walking and can hardly keep pace with you?"""
22481,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22482,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","Then the miller, who was a good-natured man, took his son up behind"
22483,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","him, and in this way they went to the town."
22484,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22485,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""My good fellow,"" said a townsman whom they met, ""is that ass your"
22486,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","own?"""
22487,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22488,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""Yes,"" replied the miller."
22489,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22490,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""I should not have thought so, by the way you load him,"" said the man."
22491,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""Why, you two are better able to carry the beast than he is to carry"
22492,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","you."""
22493,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22494,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","""Well,"" said the miller, ""we can but try."""
22495,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22496,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","So he and his son got down, and tied the legs of the ass together."
22497,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","Then they slung him on a pole, and carried him on their shoulders. It"
22498,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",was such a funny sight that the people laughed and jeered at them.
22499,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22500,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","The poor ass was very uncomfortable, and tried hard to get off the"
22501,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS","pole. At last, as they were passing over a bridge, he pulled his legs"
22502,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",out of the rope and tumbled to the ground. He was so frightened that
22503,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",he jumped off the bridge into the river and was drowned.
22504,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",
22505,"THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS",Do you know what this story teaches you?

22518,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Christmas was so near. They talked of nothing but Santa Claus.
22519,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22520,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Don't you wish you could _see_ him?"" they said over and over."
22521,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22522,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"One night, just before Christmas, Mother tucked them in bed and left"

22526,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Jack,"" Margaret whispered, ""are you asleep?"""

22530,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22531,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"They both listened, and they heard a little _tap, tap_ on the window."
22532,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"They looked, and there, right in the window, they saw a funny little"
22533,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Brownie.
22534,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22535,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""What's that I heard you say? You want to see Santa Claus? Well, I"
22536,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,am one of his Brownies. I am on my way back to Santa Claus Land. I'll
22537,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"take you with me if you want to go."""
22538,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22539,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Jack and Margaret scrambled from their beds.
22540,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22541,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Come on, show us the way!"" they cried in great excitement."
22542,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22543,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""No, indeed,"" said the Brownie. ""No one must know the way to Santa"
22544,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Claus Land. Kindly wait a moment."""
22545,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22546,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Then the Brownie took something soft and thick and dark, and tied it"
22547,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"around Jack's eyes. Next he took something soft and thick and dark,"
22548,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,and tied it around Margaret's eyes.
22549,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22550,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""How many fingers before you?"" he asked."
22551,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22552,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Both of them shook their heads. They could not see a wink.
22553,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22554,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Very well, now we're off,"" said the Brownie."
22555,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22556,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"He took Jack's hand on one side, and Margaret's on the other. It"
22557,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,seemed as if they flew through the window. They went on swiftly for a
22558,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"little while, then the Brownie whirled them round and round until"
22559,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"they were dizzy, and off they went again. The children could not tell"
22560,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"whether they were going north, south, east, or west. After a time they"
22561,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,stopped.
22562,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22563,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Here we are,"" said the Brownie."
22564,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22565,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"He uncovered their eyes, and the children saw that they were standing"
22566,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"before a big, thick gate."
22567,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22568,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"The Brownie knocked and the gate was swung open. They went through it,"
22569,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,right into Santa Claus's garden.
22570,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22571,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,It was a very queer garden. There were rows and rows of Christmas
22572,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"trees, all glittering with balls and cobwebby tinsel, and instead"
22573,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,of flower beds there were beds of every kind of toy in the world.
22574,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Margaret at once ran over to a bed of dolls.
22575,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22576,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Let's see if any of them are ripe,"" said the Brownie."
22577,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22578,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Ripe?"" said Margaret in great surprise."
22579,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22580,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Why, of course,"" said the Brownie. ""Now if this one is ripe it will"
22581,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"shut its eyes."""
22582,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22583,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,The Brownie picked a little doll from the bed and laid it in
22584,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Margaret's arms. Its eyes went half shut, and then stuck."
22585,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22586,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""No, it's not ripe yet,"" said the Brownie. ""Try this one."""
22587,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22588,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"He picked another one, and this one shut its eyes just as if it had"
22589,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,gone to sleep.
22590,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22591,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""We'll take that one,"" he said, and he dropped it into a big sack he"
22592,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,was carrying.
22593,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22594,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Now this one cries, if it's ripe,"" he said as he picked a lovely"
22595,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"infant doll. The Brownie gave it a squeeze, and the doll made a funny"
22596,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,squeaking noise.
22597,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22598,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Not quite ripe,"" he said, and he put it back into the bed. He tried"
22599,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"several others, and he picked a good many. Some of them cried, some"
22600,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"said ""Mamma"" and ""Papa,"" and some danced when they were wound up."
22601,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22602,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Oh, do come over here, Margaret!"" Jack called."
22603,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22604,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Margaret ran over to another bed and there were drums--big drums,"
22605,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"little drums, and middle sized drums; yellow drums, blue drums, green"
22606,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"drums, red drums."
22607,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22608,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Can we gather some of these?"" said Jack to the Brownie."
22609,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22610,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Why, of course. Let's see if this one is ripe."""
22611,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22612,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"The Brownie took up a little red drum, and gave it a thump with a"
22613,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,drum stick. But it made such a queer sound that Jack and Margaret both
22614,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"laughed out loud. The little red drum was put back into the bed, and"
22615,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,the Brownie tried another big one. It went _Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
22616,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Boom_! and Jack and Margaret marched all along the bed, keeping step"
22617,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,to it.
22618,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22619,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"When they had finished picking drums, they went over to a bed filled"
22620,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,with horns. That was the most fun of all. Some of them made very queer
22621,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"noises, and on some the Brownie played jolly little tunes."
22622,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22623,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,The next bed they came to was filled with toys which could be wound
22624,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"up. There were trains, automobiles, dancing dolls, climbing monkeys,"
22625,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"hopping birds, funny wobbling ducks, and every kind of toy you could"
22626,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,think of. The children stayed at this bed for a long time.
22627,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22628,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"At last Margaret said: ""But where is Santa Claus? We wanted to see"
22629,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"him."""
22630,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22631,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Oh, to be sure,"" said the Brownie. ""Come along,"" and he led them down"
22632,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"a long, winding walk, to the edge of the garden. Then he pointed to a"
22633,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,hill in the distance.
22634,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22635,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Do you see that large white house? There is where he lives."""
22636,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22637,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,The children stared at it. It was so white that it seemed to shine in
22638,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,the distance.
22639,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22640,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Walk right across here,"" said the Brownie, ""then up the hill to Santa"
22641,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Claus's house."""
22642,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22643,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Oh, must we walk across there?"" said Margaret. She stared down at"
22644,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,the deep dark chasm between the garden and the hill; across it was
22645,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,stretched a narrow plank.
22646,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22647,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Walk carefully,"" said the Brownie, ""and mind you don't look down; for"
22648,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"if you do, I'm afraid you won't see Santa Claus to-night."""
22649,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22650,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""We'll be very careful,"" said Jack. ""Come along, Margaret,"" and he"
22651,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,took his little sister's hand and they started across the plank.
22652,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22653,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,They had almost reached the middle of it when Jack looked down.
22654,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22655,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Oh!"" he said, and gave Margaret a pull."
22656,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22657,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"She looked down too, and cried ""Oh, Oh!"" and down, down, down they"
22658,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,went.
22659,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22660,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,Suddenly they landed with a thump. They sat up and rubbed their eyes.
22661,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,There they were right in their own beds at home. Mother opened the
22662,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,door.
22663,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22664,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Are you awake, children?"" she said."
22665,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22666,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"""Oh, Mother, we haven't been asleep. We've been to Santa Claus Land,"
22667,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"and we nearly saw Santa Claus!"""
22668,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,
22669,THE VISIT TO SANTA CLAUS LAND,"Then they told her all about it, and Mother just smiled."

22677,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22678,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22679,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,There was once a little Brownie who lived in a hollow tree stump. He
22680,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,had been busy all the day playing pranks. His pranks had taken him
22681,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,far away from home to the house of a very important laird. Into the
22682,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,laird's cup of wine he had dropped some sour berries which he had
22683,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"picked on his way. He also put thistles into his boots, so that when"
22684,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,the laird had drawn them on he had screamed out with pain.
22685,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22686,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"The Brownie had been away all the day, so that when at last he turned"
22687,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,to go back to his home he felt really very tired. On his way back to
22688,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,the wood he passed by a cozy-looking farmhouse. The door of the dairy
22689,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,was open. The Brownie thought this would be a very nice cool place
22690,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"in which to rest for a few moments. So he slipped into the dairy, and"
22691,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,curled himself up underneath the bench to have a nice little doze.
22692,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22693,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,He was so weary that once he had fallen asleep he never woke up again
22694,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"until it was quite dark, when he was disturbed by two lassies who had"
22695,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,come into the dairy.
22696,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22697,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"One was carrying a candle in her hand, and by its light the pair"
22698,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,espied a big bowl of cream on the shelf. The naughty girls thought
22699,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,that they would drink it for supper. They could only find one spoon
22700,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"on the shelf, so they decided they would each have a spoonful in turn."
22701,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"Lassie Jean took the bowl and carried it to a bench in the corner, and"
22702,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,Lassie Meg followed it with the candle. No sooner had the two girls
22703,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"settled themselves than the Brownie, who was now wide awake, and who"
22704,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"was himself feeling that some supper might not be out of place, crept"
22705,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,up behind them and blew out the candle.
22706,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22707,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,The lassies at first were very much concerned at being in the dark;
22708,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"nevertheless they determined they would drink the cream, all the same."
22709,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22710,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,Lassie Jean filled the spoon with the rich delicacy. She was about to
22711,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,raise it to her lips when the naughty Brownie poked his head over her
22712,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"shoulder, and lapped it out of the spoon before it had reached her"
22713,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"mouth. Lassie Meg, believing that Lassie Jean had already swallowed"
22714,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"some cream while she had had none, stretched out her hand to take away"
22715,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,the spoon from her friend. Lassie Jean was not willing to give it
22716,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"up, since she said she had not yet tasted any cream. Lassie Meg was"
22717,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"unwilling to believe her, for she declared she had heard her lapping"
22718,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,the cream.
22719,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22720,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"Without waiting for Lassie Jean to explain, she snatched the spoon out"
22721,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"of her friend's hand. She filled it with cream from the bowl, and"
22722,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,was about to raise it to her lips when the Brownie jumped from behind
22723,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"Lassie Jean, and settling himself behind Lassie Meg's shoulders, poked"
22724,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"forward his head, and again lapped up the cream from out of the spoon."
22725,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22726,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,Lassie Jean in her turn snatched back the spoon from Lassie Meg. Thus
22727,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"they went on, for every time one or the other raised the spoonful"
22728,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,of cream to her lips it was lapped up by the Brownie. This continued
22729,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"until the bowl was emptied. The Brownie was full of cream, but"
22730,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"the poor lassies had not so much as tasted one drop, although each"
22731,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,believed the other had drunk it all.
22732,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22733,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,The lassies were still quarreling when the door of the dairy was
22734,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"opened, and the farmer's wife entered, carrying a lighted candle in"
22735,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,her hand. The moment that she did so the Brownie hopped under the
22736,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,bench and the lassies started up guiltily.
22737,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22738,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,The farmer's wife caught sight of the empty basin. She was very angry
22739,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"with them indeed. When they tried hastily to explain, each blaming"
22740,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"the other, the farmer's wife would not listen, but only grew the more"
22741,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"angry. She told them that, since they had supped so well, they should"
22742,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,have none of the scones and eggs which she had prepared for the
22743,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,evening meal in the kitchen.
22744,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,
22745,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"When the farmer's wife had entered she had left the door open, so"
22746,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,while she was busily scolding the lassies the Brownie slipped out
22747,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,from under the bench and made his escape. As he ran chuckling down
22748,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,"the road, he could still hear her angry voice drowning the attempted"
22749,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,explanations of the bewildered lassies. When the little fellow curled
22750,THE GREEDY BROWNIE,himself up some time later in the tree trunk he was still laughing.

22929,I,
22930,I,It was the tailor's mother who spoke. She was a very old woman and
22931,I,nearly helpless. All day she sat in a large armchair knitting rugs.
22932,I,
22933,I,"""What have my two lads ever done to help me?"" continued the tailor,"
22934,I,"sadly. ""They do nothing but play. If I send Tommy on an errand, he"

22965,I,

22971,I,"""The Old Owl in the woods knows; I do not. When I was young many"

22982,I,"""You may set out what you like, my lad, but you must go to bed now."""
22983,I,
22984,I,The boys brought out a pan of water. Then they climbed the ladder to

22986,I,
22987,I,"Johnny was soon in the land of dreams, but Tommy lay awake thinking"

22998,II,"""and it is time for me to go."" Downstairs he crept softly and out into"
22999,II,the still night.
23000,II,
23001,II,"""Hoot! hoot!"" cried a voice from the grove near the house."
23002,II,
23003,II,"""That's the Old Owl,"" thought Tommy. He ran to a big tree and looked"
23004,II,"up. There he saw the Old Owl, sitting on a branch and staring at him"
23005,II,with yellow eyes.
23006,II,
23007,II,"""Oh, dear!"" said Tommy, for he did not like the Owl very well."
23008,II,
23009,II,"""Come up here! Come up here!"" she cried."
23010,II,
23011,II,Tommy climbed the tree and sat face to face with her on the big
23012,II,branch.
23013,II,
23014,II,"""Now, what do you want?"" said the Owl."
23015,II,
23016,II,"""Please,"" said Tommy, ""I want to know where to find the brownies, and"
23017,II,"how to get one to come and live with us."""
23018,II,
23019,II,"""Oo-hoo! oo-hoo!"" said the Owl. ""That's it, is it? I know of three"
23020,II,"brownies."""
23021,II,
23022,II,"""Hurrah!"" said Tommy. ""Where do they live?"""
23023,II,
23024,II,"""In your house,"" said the Owl."
23025,II,
23026,II,"""In our house! Whereabouts? Why don't they work?"" cried Tommy."
23027,II,
23028,II,"""One of them is too little,"" said the Owl."
23029,II,
23030,II,"""But why don't the other two do something?"" said Tommy. ""Nobody does"
23031,II,"any work at our house except father."""
23032,II,
23033,II,"""They are idle, they are idle,"" said the Old Owl."
23034,II,
23035,II,"""Then we don't want them,"" said Tommy. ""What is the use of having"
23036,II,"brownies in the house if they do nothing to help us?"""
23037,II,
23038,II,"""Perhaps they don't know what to do."""
23039,II,
23040,II,"""I wish you would tell me where to find them,"" said Tommy. ""I could"
23041,II,"tell them what to do."""
23042,II,
23043,II,"""Could you, could you? Oo-hoo! oo-hoo!"" and Tommy could not tell"
23044,II,whether the Owl was hooting or laughing.
23045,II,
23046,II,"""Of course I could. They might get up early in the morning and sweep"
23047,II,"the house, and light the fire, and spread the table before my father"
23048,II,"comes downstairs."""
23049,II,
23050,II,"""So they might!"" said the Owl. ""Well, I can tell you where to find one"
23051,II,"of the brownies, and he can tell you where to find his brother. Go to"
23052,II,"the north side of the pond, where the moon is shining on the water,"
23053,II,"turn yourself around three times, while you say this charm:"
23054,II,
23055,II,'_Twist me and turn me and show me the elf_--
23056,II,I looked in the water and saw_--'
23057,II,
23058,II,"Then look in the water, and think of a word which rhymes with 'elf'"
23059,II,"and makes the charm complete."""
23060,II,
23061,II,"Tommy knew the place very well. He ran to the north side of the pond,"
23062,II,"and turning himself around three times, he repeated the charm. Then he"
23063,II,looked in and saw--himself.
23064,II,
23065,II,"""Why, there's no one but myself. I can't think of the right word. What"
23066,II,"can it be? I'll go back and ask the Old Owl,"" thought Tommy. And back"
23067,II,he went. There sat the Owl as before.
23068,II,
23069,II,"""Oo-hoo,"" said she, as Tommy climbed up. ""Did you find out the word?"""
23070,II,
23071,II,"""No,"" said Tommy, ""I could find no word that rhymes with 'elf' except"
23072,II,"'myself.'"""
23073,II,
23074,II,"""Well, that is the word! Now, do you know where your brother is?"""
23075,II,
23076,II,"""In bed in the loft,"" said Tommy."
23077,II,
23078,II,"""Then all your questions are answered. Good night;"" and the Old Owl"
23079,II,began to shake her feathers.
23080,II,
23081,II,"""Don't go yet,"" said Tommy, humbly; ""I don't understand you. I am not"
23082,II,"a brownie, am I?"""
23083,II,
23084,II,"""Yes, you are, and a very idle one, too,"" said the Old Owl. ""All"
23085,II,"children are brownies."""
23086,II,
23087,II,"""But are there really any brownies except children?"" inquired Tommy,"
23088,II,in a dismal tone.
23089,II,
23090,II,"""No, there are not. Now listen to me, Tommy. Little people can do only"
23091,II,"little things. When they are idle and mischievous, they are called"
23092,II,"boggarts, and they are a burden to the house they live in. When they"
23093,II,"are thoughtful and useful, they are brownies, and are a blessing to"
23094,II,"every one."""
23095,II,
23096,II,"""I'll be a brownie,"" said Tommy. ""I won't be a boggart. Now I'll go"
23097,II,"home and tell Johnny."""
23098,II,
23099,II,"""I'll take you home,"" said the Owl, and in a moment Tommy found"
23100,II,"himself in bed, with Johnny sleeping by his side."
23101,II,
23102,II,"""How quickly we came,"" said Tommy to himself. ""But is it morning? That"
23103,II,"is very strange! I thought the moon was shining. Come, Johnny, get up,"
23104,II,"I have a story to tell you."""
23105,II,
23106,II,
23107,III,III
23108,III,
23109,III,
23110,III,While his brother was rubbing his eyes Tommy told him of his visit to
23111,III,the Old Owl in the grove.
23112,III,
23113,III,"""Is that all true?"" asked Johnny."
23114,III,
23115,III,"""It is all just as I tell you, and if we don't want to be boggarts, we"
23116,III,"must get up and go to work."""
23117,III,
23118,III,"""I won't be a boggart,"" said Johnny, and so the two brownies crept"
23119,III,"softly down the ladder into the kitchen. ""I will light the fire,"""
23120,III,"said Tommy. ""And you, Johnny, can dig some potatoes to roast for"
23121,III,"breakfast."" They swept the room and laid the table. Just as they were"
23122,III,putting the potatoes in a dish they heard footsteps.
23123,III,
23124,III,"""There's father,"" said Tommy; ""we must run."""
23125,III,
23126,III,The poor tailor came wearily down the stairs. Morning after morning he
23127,III,had found an untidy room and an empty table. But now when he entered
23128,III,"the kitchen, he looked around in great surprise. He put his hand out"
23129,III,to the fire to see if it was really warm. He touched the potatoes and
23130,III,"looked at the neat room. Then he shouted, ""Mother, mother! boys, boys,"
23131,III,"the brownie has come!"""
23132,III,
23133,III,"There was great excitement in the small house, but the boys said"
23134,III,"nothing. All day the tailor talked about the brownie. ""I have often"
23135,III,"heard of Little People,"" he said, ""but this is wonderful. To come and"
23136,III,"do the work for a pan of cold water! Who would have believed it?"""
23137,III,
23138,III,The boys said nothing until they were both in bed. Then Tommy said:
23139,III,"""The Old Owl was right, and we must stick to the work if we don't"
23140,III,want to be boggarts. But I don't like to have father thinking that we
23141,III,"are still idle. I wish he knew that we are the brownies."""
23142,III,
23143,III,"""So do I,"" said Johnny."
23144,III,
23145,III,"Day after day went by and still the boys rose early, and each day they"
23146,III,found more and more to do. The brownies were the joy of the tailor's
23147,III,life.
23148,III,
23149,III,One day a message came for the tailor to go to a farmhouse several
23150,III,"miles away. The farmer gave him an order for a suit of clothes, and"
23151,III,"paid him at once. Full of joy at his good fortune, he hurried home. As"
23152,III,"he came near the house, he saw that the garden had been weeded. ""It's"
23153,III,"that brownie!"" he said; ""and I shall make a suit of clothes for him."""
23154,III,
23155,III,"""If you make clothes for the brownie, he will leave the house,"" said"
23156,III,the grandmother.
23157,III,
23158,III,"""Not if the clothes are a good fit, mother. I shall measure them by"
23159,III,"Tommy, for they say the brownies are about his size."""
23160,III,
23161,III,At last a fine new suit with brass buttons was finished and laid out
23162,III,for the brownie.
23163,III,
23164,III,"""Don't the clothes look fine?"" said Tommy, when he came down in the"
23165,III,"morning; ""I'll try them on."""
23166,III,
23167,III,"The tailor rose earlier than usual that day, for he wished to catch a"
23168,III,glimpse of the brownies. He went softly downstairs. There was Johnny
23169,III,"sweeping the floor, and Tommy trying on the new suit."
23170,III,
23171,III,"""What does this mean?"" shouted the father."
23172,III,
23173,III,"""It's the brownies,"" said the boys."
23174,III,
23175,III,"""This is no joke,"" cried the tailor, angrily. ""Where are the real"
23176,III,"brownies, I say?"""
23177,III,
23178,III,"""We are the only brownies, father,"" said Tommy."
23179,III,
23180,III,"""I can't understand this. Who has been sweeping the kitchen lately, I"
23181,III,"should like to know?"""
23182,III,
23183,III,"""We have,"" said the boys."
23184,III,
23185,III,"""Who gets breakfast and puts things in order?"""
23186,III,
23187,III,"""We do! we do!"" they shouted."
23188,III,
23189,III,"""But when do you do it?"""
23190,III,
23191,III,"""Early in the morning before you come down."""
23192,III,
23193,III,"""But if you do the work, where is the brownie?"""
23194,III,
23195,III,"""Here,"" cried the boys; ""we are the brownies, and we are sorry that we"
23196,III,"were boggarts so long."""
23197,III,
23198,III,The father was delighted to find how helpful his boys had become. The
23199,III,"grandmother, however, could hardly believe that a real brownie had not"
23200,III,been in the house. But as she sat in her chair day after day watching
23201,III,"the boys at their work, she often repeated her favorite saying,"
23202,III,"""Children are a blessing."""

23210,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23211,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"Once upon a time there were three children named Wendy, John, and"
23212,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"Michael, who lived with their father and mother in London. One evening"
23213,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"the father and mother were invited to a party, and the mother, after"
23214,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"lighting the dim lamp in the nursery and kissing them good-night, went"
23215,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"away. That evening a little boy climbed in through the window, whose"
23216,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"name was Peter Pan. He was a curious little fellow, very conceited,"
23217,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"very forgetful, and yet very lovable. The most remarkable thing about"
23218,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,him was that he never grew up. There came flitting in through the
23219,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"window with him his fairy, whose name was Tinker Bell. Peter Pan woke"
23220,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"all the children up, and after he had sprinkled fairy dust on their"
23221,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"shoulders, he took them away to the Neverland, where he lived with a"
23222,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"family of lost boys. Tinker Bell was jealous of the little girl Wendy,"
23223,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,and she hurried ahead of Peter Pan and persuaded the boys that Wendy
23224,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"was a bird who might do them harm, and so one of the boys shot her"
23225,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,with his bow and arrow.
23226,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23227,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,When Peter Pan came and found Wendy lying lifeless upon the ground in
23228,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"the woods he was very angry, but he was also very quick-witted. So"
23229,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,he told the boys that if they would build a house around Wendy he was
23230,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,sure that she would be better. So they hurried to collect everything
23231,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,they had out of which they could make a house. Though she was not yet
23232,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"strong enough to talk, they thought perhaps she might sing the kind of"
23233,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"house she would like to have, so Wendy sang softly this little verse:"
23234,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23235,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"""I wish I had a pretty house,"
23236,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"The littlest ever seen,"
23237,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,With funny little red walls
23238,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"And roof of mossy green."""
23239,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23240,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"When the house was done Peter Pan took John's hat for the chimney, and"
23241,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,the little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that
23242,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,smoke at once began to come out through the hat. All that night Peter
23243,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"Pan walked up and down in front of Wendy's house, to watch over her"
23244,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,and keep her from danger while she slept.
23245,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23246,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"All these children lived in an underground cave, and the next day,"
23247,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"when Wendy got well, they all went down into the cave and Wendy agreed"
23248,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,to be their mother and Peter their father. They had many good times
23249,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,together. They also had some exciting adventures with the red-skins
23250,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,and with a pirate named Captain Hook and his crew. After a time the
23251,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"redskins became their friends, and Peter rescued his family from the"
23252,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,pirates' ship.
23253,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23254,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,One day Wendy and her brothers realized that they had been away so
23255,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,long that perhaps their mother had forgotten them and shut the window
23256,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,of the nursery so that they could not get back. They decided to hurry
23257,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"home. When they reached home Peter Pan was before them, and he closed"
23258,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,the window so that they could not get back. But when he heard the
23259,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"children's mother singing such a sad song inside, his heart was made"
23260,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,tender and he opened the window and the children crept back safely
23261,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,into their mother's arms. Wendy's mother invited Peter Pan to stay
23262,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"and be her child, but Peter was so afraid that he would have to go"
23263,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,to school and grow up and be a man that he went back to his home in
23264,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,fairy-land.
23265,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23266,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,Wendy promised to go once a year and stay a few days with Peter Pan
23267,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,and clean house and mend his clothes. Let us picture them in the
23268,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"little house that was built for Wendy, which the fairies had put up in"
23269,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,the branches of a pine-tree. The birds are singing in their nests and
23270,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"in the branches, and far below the clouds you can see the land and"
23271,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,the sea. Wendy is sewing for Peter and Peter Pan is playing his pipes
23272,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,while she works. When night comes the woods are full of flashing
23273,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"lights like little stars, because the fairies are flitting around the"
23274,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,"house where Peter and Wendy live, and are singing to them as they go"
23275,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,to sleep.
23276,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,
23277,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,In a few days Wendy will go back to John and Michael to tell them what
23278,THE STORY OF PETER PAN,a good time she had on her visit in the little house in the woods.

23344,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23345,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,BY KATE E. BUNCE (after RUDOLF BAUNBACH)
23346,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23347,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"To Heaven's Meadows, bright with flowers and sunshine,"
23348,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"The little children go,"
23349,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"When they have had enough of life's sad dreaming,"
23350,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And leave the earth below.
23351,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23352,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,But as they had not time to learn their lessons
23353,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Before they went away,"
23354,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"There is a school, where all the angel children"
23355,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Must work four hours a day.
23356,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23357,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"With golden pencils upon silver tablets,"
23358,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They copy fairy tales,"
23359,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And learn to keep their halos bright and shining,"
23360,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And sing, and play their scales."
23361,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23362,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And twice a week they glide with merry laughter
23363,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"All down the Milky Way,"
23364,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And homeward in the evening wander softly
23365,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Upon a sunset ray.
23366,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23367,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"But Sunday is the day they love and long for,"
23368,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Then all the children go
23369,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And play from morn till night within a meadow
23370,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Where flowers in thousands grow.
23371,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23372,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"The meadow is not green, but blue and golden"
23373,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,The flowers like dewdrops bright;
23374,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"When it is night, they burn and glow and glisten--"
23375,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Men call them stars of light.
23376,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23377,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Through Heaven's gate they all must pass to find it,"
23378,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Where Peter with the key
23379,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Keeps watch and warns the little angels kindly
23380,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,How good they all must be.
23381,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23382,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They must not fly about or run too quickly,"
23383,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Nor go too far away,"
23384,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And when upon his golden key he calls them,"
23385,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Then they must all obey.
23386,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23387,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,One day it was so very hot in Heaven
23388,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"That good St. Peter slept,"
23389,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And when the little angel children saw it,"
23390,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Away they quickly crept.
23391,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23392,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Ah! then they ran and flew about with laughter,"
23393,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And fluttered far and wide,"
23394,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,So far they wandered that of Heaven's meadow
23395,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They reached the other side.
23396,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23397,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They came to where the strong, tall, wooden paling"
23398,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Shuts all that place away,"
23399,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Where idle, careless, mischief-loving, naughty,"
23400,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,The Imps of Darkness stray.
23401,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23402,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And there the angels stopped, devoutly wishing"
23403,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Some opening there might be,"
23404,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"So that they might each one in turn peep through it,"
23405,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And see what they could see.
23406,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23407,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"But not a chink or hole, for all their seeking,"
23408,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"No gleam of light pierced through,"
23409,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"So with their little wings outspread and eager,"
23410,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Right to the top they flew.
23411,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23412,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And looking down they saw with awe and wonder.
23413,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Imps all as black as soot;
23414,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Each had two horns and each a tail to play with,"
23415,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And hoof, instead of foot."
23416,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23417,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They heard the rustle of the angel feathers,"
23418,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They felt the cool sweet air,"
23419,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And, lifting up their little coal-black faces,"
23420,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They saw Heaven's children there.
23421,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23422,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Then with one voice they cried: ""Oh! angel Children,"
23423,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"You look so good and fair,"
23424,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"We pray you, let us come up into Heaven"
23425,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And play a little there.
23426,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23427,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"""We will not tweak nor pull your shining feathers,"
23428,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,But be so very good;
23429,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"We will not try and steal your little halos,"
23430,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"But all do as we should."""
23431,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23432,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Then quick they flew away for Jacob's ladder,"
23433,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"(Peter was still asleep),"
23434,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And placed it safely, where from Heaven to Imp-land"
23435,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,The way was dark and steep.
23436,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23437,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Then every little imp, with shouts and laughter,"
23438,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Helped by an angel's hand,"
23439,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Scrambled right over the great wooden paling,"
23440,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And stood in Heaven's land.
23441,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23442,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They all, with air sedate and pious faces,"
23443,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Discreetly walked around,"
23444,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Their tails like trains upon their arms upholding,"
23445,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And eyes upon the ground.
23446,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23447,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"The little angels fluttered round in rapture,"
23448,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And showed the lovely flowers,"
23449,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And bade them listen to the thrilling voices
23450,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Of birds in Heaven's bowers.
23451,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23452,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And gently led them by the crystal streamlets,"
23453,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Bade them on dewdrops feast,"
23454,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And showed them where the silver moon was rising
23455,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,To light them from the east.
23456,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23457,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Alas! when all the little demons saw her,"
23458,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"The moon, so large and round,"
23459,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They all began to roar, and growl, and gibber,"
23460,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And leap from off the ground;
23461,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23462,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And mocked the great white moon with ugly faces,"
23463,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Turned somersaults in air,"
23464,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And when the angels prayed them cease, in terror,"
23465,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They vowed they did not care.
23466,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23467,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They trampled down the grass in Heaven's Meadow,"
23468,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They tore the flowers about,"
23469,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And flung them on the earth beyond the paling,"
23470,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"With gibe, and jeer, and shout."
23471,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23472,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They chased the birds that sang among the tree-tops
23473,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And hushed their music sweet,"
23474,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They pulled the little angels' tender feathers
23475,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And trod upon their feet.
23476,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23477,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Then to the good St. Peter cried the angels
23478,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"To help them in their pain,"
23479,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And if he would but this one time forgive them,"
23480,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They would be good again.
23481,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23482,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Then rose St. Peter from his peaceful dreaming--
23483,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,An angry saint was he--
23484,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"He wrung his hands and clasped his head in horror,"
23485,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And seized his golden key.
23486,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23487,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Then blew a mighty blast in wrath upon it;
23488,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Back all the angels flew,"
23489,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And wide he threw the door of heaven open,"
23490,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And thrust the children through.
23491,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23492,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And then he called two great and powerful angels,"
23493,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"The strongest of the race,"
23494,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"To chase the little demons out of Heaven,"
23495,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And clear the holy place.
23496,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23497,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"They gathered up the little imps in armfuls,"
23498,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Bore them with mighty stride,"
23499,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And flung them over the strong wooden paling
23500,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Down on the other side.
23501,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23502,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And though they fought and lashed their tails and whimpered,"
23503,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"And kicked with might and main,"
23504,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"To Heaven's Meadow, bright with sun and flowers"
23505,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,They never came again.
23506,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23507,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,For two long months the little angel-children
23508,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Were not allowed to play
23509,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Before the door of Heaven in the meadow,"
23510,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,But stayed in all the day.
23511,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23512,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And when again they sought the Heavenly Meadow
23513,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,Each child with humble mind
23514,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Must lay aside its little shining halo,"
23515,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,And leave its wings behind.
23516,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,
23517,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"But all the flowers that on that day of sorrow,"
23518,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Flung out and scattered were,"
23519,THE IMPS IN THE HEAVENLY MEADOW,"Took root and bloom again in earth's green meadows,"

23531,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23532,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,Once upon a time there lived in green Erin a little girl by the name
23533,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,of Nora. Her home was a small thatched cottage of stone beside the
23534,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"brae at the foot of a mountain, in the midst of a woodland so deep"
23535,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,that in the summer time when the trees were full the sun got its rays
23536,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,inside but a few hours of the day and you could see of the star-dust
23537,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,that covers the fields of the sky no piece larger than the palm of
23538,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,your hand.
23539,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23540,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"It was a famous meeting-place for the fairies, this haunt at the foot"
23541,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"of the mountain by the stream, for the Little Folk from the heather"
23542,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,above used nightly to foregather in the meadow with the Little Folk
23543,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"from the woodland below, and there they danced the long night through"
23544,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,among the shamrocks. But although Nora had heard about the fairies
23545,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"from her grandmother, who sat all day tending the peat fire, and"
23546,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,something more about them from her mother when of an evening after
23547,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"supper she had time to speak to Nora of herself when she was a girl,"
23548,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,yet Nora had never in all her life set eyes upon one of these feasters
23549,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"of the forest. For the fairies, mind you, come only to two kinds of"
23550,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"folk, to those who believe in them and to those who need them. Now"
23551,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Nora believed in the fairies all right, all right, but she had never"
23552,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"been in need of them until now, at this time that I'm telling ye of."
23553,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23554,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,Now this same Nora was one of these lasses that is a wee bit gloomery.
23555,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"And ye don't know what this same gloomery is? Well, she was at times"
23556,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,hindered by a rainy mornin' disposition. So it was plain enough to the
23557,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,fairies that she was in some need of them.
23558,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23559,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,One day Nora went into the deep of the wildwood a few steps below her
23560,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,mother's cottage to a trysting-place where she often resorted when she
23561,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,had the time from her daily duties.
23562,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23563,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"She had been unusually heckled that morning, as all of us are at"
23564,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"times, by being obliged to do many things for the which she had little"
23565,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,liking. The spot was a favorite one of Nora's.
23566,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23567,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"There was a shelter of rocks above, almost like a cave or roof, and"
23568,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,below there was a tiny stream of water that ran out of a spring in the
23569,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,back of the hill and sang its way down the slope to the brae below.
23570,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"In this pool Nora nearly always laid some field flowers, because they"
23571,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,kept fresher there than anywhere else. From the low seat that Nora had
23572,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,made out of a stone in the back of her shelter she looked out into a
23573,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"sunny place in the woods, around which stood, as if they were pillars"
23574,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"of a woodland palace, six gray beeches."
23575,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23576,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Now upon this sunny afternoon that I am speaking of, hardly had Nora"
23577,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"reclined upon her bench, feeling a bit drowsy no doubt with the heat,"
23578,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"yet not quite sleepy you know, listening to a robin singing with"
23579,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"the voice of Eden, when she heard a light tapping on the wall of the"
23580,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"largest beech, the one that was nearest to the place where she was"
23581,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,lying. At first when she heard this sound she thought that it was the
23582,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,robin redbreast that she had noticed hopping up and down in the open
23583,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"place in the sunlight, and yet she knew well that robins do not drum"
23584,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,upon the bark of trees like woodpeckers. So she jumped lightly up and
23585,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"ran to the tree, and at once she was aware that the tapping was from"
23586,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,inside the tree. And between the taps that were no louder than those
23587,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,of a branch against a window-pane she distinctly heard a very tiny
23588,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,voice.
23589,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23590,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""How tiny was the voice, Michael aroon?"""
23591,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23592,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,You are asking me how tiny was the voice? Let me see if I can tell
23593,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,you. You have heard the sound of the rivulet when it falls upon the
23594,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"mossy stones in the pasture by the bar-way? Well, it was about as"
23595,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,loud as the echo of that if you should walk thirty paces away and then
23596,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,listen. So Nora had to put her ear up close against the breast of the
23597,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,beech-tree and even then the voice sounded no louder than the sound
23598,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,of a beech-leaf when it falls from a branch into the moss-bed. But she
23599,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"could hear what that voice was saying, and it was these words: ""Nora,"
23600,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"my darling, turn the key and let me out."" Nora looked around in"
23601,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"amazement, but sure enough, there on the breast of the beech, about"
23602,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"the height of her heart, was a small key of the color of the bark,"
23603,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"that she had never noticed before, though she had hugged that"
23604,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"beech-tree every morning of her life. So Nora turned the key at once,"
23605,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"and out stepped----"""
23606,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23607,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""A fairy, Michael?"""
23608,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23609,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Yes, better than a fairy, a dryad, that is a fairy of the tree. For a"
23610,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,fairy of a tree is as much higher in rank than a fairy of the meadow
23611,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,as a duchess is than a goose-girl. She was about the size of the robin
23612,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"redbreast, and she was dressed all in green, except a lovely cloak of"
23613,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"red that, when it was folded about her, made her look very much indeed"
23614,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"like the redbreast himself, and she was no bit bigger than the robin"
23615,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,either.
23616,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23617,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""Nora Mavourneen,"" said the dryad, ""I have been noticing that you"
23618,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"seem a bit sad-hearted of late, and for no reason either that anybody"
23619,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"knows, so if you don't mind I will take you with me for a walk this"
23620,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"afternoon through fairyland, and we will see if we cannot do something"
23621,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"to restore your good spirits again."""
23622,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23623,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"At these words Nora danced for joy, and you would never have been able"
23624,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,to guess that she had ever known a downhearted moment. So the dryad
23625,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"clapped her tiny hands three times, and out of the open door into the"
23626,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"beech-tree stepped a little gnome who came and bowed low before them,"
23627,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,holding in his hands a silver salver on which lay a little pellet.
23628,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23629,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""How little was the pellet, uncle?"""
23630,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23631,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""Well, what would you say if I told you that it was as small as a"
23632,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"humming bird's egg? Oh, you think it was smaller than that? Well, how"
23633,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,about the seed of a coriander? No? Then I will tell you the truth. It
23634,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"was as small as the gnat that gets into your eye, that feels as big as"
23635,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"a rat."""
23636,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23637,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,So Nora took the pellet from the platter and thanked the gnome kindly
23638,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"and she ate it down, and no sooner had she swallowed it than she was"
23639,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,no bigger than the dryad herself.
23640,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23641,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,So the dryad took her by the hand and they walked gaily into the
23642,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"beech-tree door, and the door shut behind them."
23643,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23644,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,They went down and down a lot of winding stairs that were lighted only
23645,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,by small windows in the bark of the tree that Nora had never noticed
23646,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"before and could never find afterward. It was very cool and pleasant,"
23647,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,for they could hear the sap go singing on its way from the roots up
23648,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,to the branches and leaves and when a summer shower went by they could
23649,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,hear the raindrops as they went singing down the trunk outside to the
23650,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,roots. After they had reached the foot of the stairs they walked for
23651,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"a long way through a cool corridor. It was not quite dark, for Little"
23652,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,People stood at every turn who seemed to be doing what fireflies do
23653,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"on summer nights in the grass, and each one whistling to himself as"
23654,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,he held his softly shaded lantern aloft. Down the side passages Nora
23655,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,could see thousands of tiny miners at work. And what do you think they
23656,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,are doing?
23657,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23658,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""Digging for gold and diamonds."""
23659,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23660,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,They were tending the woodland plants that hang their golden blossoms
23661,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,in the pathways and carrying up the dewdrops that sparkle like
23662,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,diamonds from their leaves in the daybreak. And it was pleasant to see
23663,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"them work, for they were all singing."
23664,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23665,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,By and by Nora and the dryad came to a place where there was a
23666,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"brighter light ahead, and as they drew nearer Nora could see that they"
23667,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"had come to the bank of the pond that is below Nora's cottage, only"
23668,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"that they were under the surface, looking up through a light so soft"
23669,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,that it cast no shadows. And now the dryad took Nora's hand and she
23670,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"found herself in a little boat, no bigger than a leaf, sailing across"
23671,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,the pond but still beneath its surface. And here she saw on every
23672,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"hand, working amid the mire and the mirk, such jolly little divers,"
23673,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"who were feeding the fish and tending the pond lily roots, and, like"
23674,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"all the others, singing at their tasks."
23675,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23676,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,Now you will know of course that they were on their way to the home of
23677,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,the fairy queen. And it was but a short while before they were there.
23678,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"I need not tell you, children, how lovely is her palace, with its"
23679,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,golden floor and silver walls and its hangings of the colors of the
23680,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"rainbow. Nor need I say how beautiful is her majesty herself, with"
23681,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,wings like the most splendid butterfly and a gown like the morning and
23682,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,a face like the sunshine.
23683,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23684,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"It seems that Nora had come upon the queen's birthday, and she was"
23685,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,just giving the birthday honors. So Nora and the dryad stood in the
23686,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,background and watched the scene. Around the throne stood gallant
23687,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,fairy gentlemen clad like beetles and dragon flies for splendor
23688,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,and ladies whose long gowns hung like the light on the waterfall of
23689,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Loughmareen. But to the amazement of Nora, those who came forward to"
23690,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,receive the honors were for the most part dressed like workmen and
23691,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,many of them were bent with hard labor. As each advanced and made
23692,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"obeisance, the royal herald read the exploit for which the rank"
23693,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"of knighthood was about to be conferred. For one he read: ""To our"
23694,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,faithful servant who covered the lilies of Moira from the attack of
23695,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"the Frost King""; and to another: ""To the gallant yeoman who watered"
23696,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"the grain field of Kilvellin""; and to still another: ""To him who dug"
23697,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,the trench by the roadside and kept safe the highway to Throselwait
23698,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Fair."" And as each came forward the trumpets pealed in triumph, and"
23699,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,after a gold star had been pinned upon the new knight's breast the
23700,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,gentlemen and ladies of the court greeted them with hearty reverence.
23701,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"And Nora looked in the smiling face of the dryad, but said nothing."
23702,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23703,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"Then Nora herself, in a breathless moment of fear, was presented to"
23704,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"the queen, and the queen kissed her daintily just above her lips on"
23705,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,both sides. And suddenly Nora found herself back on her stony bench by
23706,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,the spring with the branches of the beech-tree waving silently before
23707,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,her.
23708,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,
23709,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"""Oh, mothereen and grandmotherkin,"" she cried as soon as she got home,"
23710,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"and she ran home all the way--""let me tell you about the wonderful"
23711,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"visit I have been making out in the wildwood."" And after she had"
23712,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"told her story, mothereen said, ""I think Nora has been dreaming,"" but"
23713,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"grandmotherkin said, ""No, daughter, I think our little acushla has had"
23714,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"her eyes opened the day."" Then Nora in triumph showed the two dimples"
23715,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"where the fairy queen had kissed her. And do you know, my darlings, I"
23716,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"cannot but think that she told the truth after all, for ever after,"
23717,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,if one kissed Nora upon those two dimples or even touched them or even
23718,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,"looked at them, she would break into the sweetest smile, and she never"
23719,BY HAPGOOD MOORE,was gloomerin' or lowerin' any more.
