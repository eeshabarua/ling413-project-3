33,PREFACE.,
34,PREFACE.,"The object of the ""GOOD CHILD'S LIBRARY,"" is to encourage a taste for"
35,PREFACE.,"Scripture reading, by presenting some of the most interesting portions"
36,PREFACE.,"of the New Testament narrative, in the attractive form of verse. While"
37,PREFACE.,"the children read these verses, they will not only become acquainted"
38,PREFACE.,with the principal events in the lives of our Blessed Saviour and His
39,PREFACE.,"Apostles--their travels, their sufferings and their death,--but they"
40,PREFACE.,"will see that the Bible is a readable book, and a book that may be read"
41,PREFACE.,"every day, without any fear of becoming the unhappy being that some"
42,PREFACE.,"persons suppose; and besides this, the tone which is given to the"
43,PREFACE.,"affections, the minds, and the morals of children by such reading, is of"
44,PREFACE.,almost infinite value.

47,PREFACE.,"possible extent, the publishers have gotten up at a great expense,"

49,PREFACE.,that have ever been published. These pictures are printed in Oil
50,PREFACE.,"Colours--an expensive, but a finished and highly artistical process, of"
51,PREFACE.,which the publishers are the originators in this country. Each history
52,PREFACE.,is illustrated handsomely with them.

159,OF THE SOWER.,
160,OF THE SOWER.,"But tribulation soon assails,"
