21,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.
22,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,
23,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,
24,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"There were once three bears, who lived in a wood,"
25,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Their porridge was thick, and their chairs and beds good."
26,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"The biggest bear, Bruin, was surly and rough;"
27,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"His wife, Mrs. Bruin, was called Mammy Muff."
28,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Their son, Tiny-cub, was like Dame Goose's lad;"
29,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"He was not very good, nor yet very bad."
30,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Now Bruin, the biggest--the surly old bear--"
31,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Had a great granite bowl, and a cast-iron chair."
32,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,Mammy Muffs bowl and chair you would no doubt prefer--
33,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"They were both made of brick-bats, but both suited her."
34,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Young Tiny-cub's bowl, chair, and bed were the best,--"
35,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"This, big bears and baby bears freely confessed."
36,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Mr. B----, with his wife and his son, went one day"
37,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"To take a short stroll, and a visit to pay."
38,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"He left the door open, ""For,"" said he, ""no doubt"
39,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"If our friend should call in, he will find us all out."""
40,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"It was only two miles from dark Hazel-nut Wood,"
41,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"In which the great house of the three Bruins stood,"
42,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"That there lived a young miss, daring, funny, and fair,"
43,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"And from having bright curls, she was called Goldenhair."
44,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"She had roamed through the wood to see what she could see,"
45,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,And she saw going walking the Bruins all three.
46,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Said she to herself, ""To rob bears is no sin;"
47,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"The three bears have gone out, so I think I'll go in."""
48,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"She entered their parlor, and she saw a great bowl,"
49,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,And in it a spoon like a hair-cutter's pole.
50,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"""That porridge,"" said she ""may stay long enough there,"
51,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"It tastes like the food of the surly old bear,"""
52,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"She tried Mammy Muff's, and she said, ""Mrs. B----,"
53,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"I think your taste and my taste will never agree."""
54,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Then she tried Tiny-Cub's bowl, and said, ""This is nice;"
55,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"I will put in some salt, and of bread a thick slice."""
56,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"The porridge she eat soon made her so great,"
57,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,The chair that she sat on broke down with her weight;
58,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"The bottom fell out, and she cried in dismay,"
59,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"""This is Tiny-cub's chair, and oh, what will he say?"
60,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"His papa is, I know, the most savage of bears,--"
61,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,His mamma is a fury; but for her who cares?
62,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"I'm sure I do not; and then, as for her son,"
63,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"That young bear, Tiny-cub--from him shall I run?"
64,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"No, not I, indeed; but I will not sit here--"
65,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"I shall next break the floor through--that's what I most fear;"""
66,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"So up-stairs she ran, and there three beds she found"
67,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"She looked under each one, and she looked all around;"
68,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"But no one she saw, so she got into bed--"
69,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"It was surly old Bruin's, and well stuffed with lead."
70,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Mammy Muffs next she tried; it was stuffed with round stones,"
71,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,So she got into Tiny-cub's and rested her bones.
72,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,Goldenhair was asleep when the three bears came in.
73,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"Said Big Bruin, ""I'm hungry--to eat, let's begin--"
74,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?"" he roared with such might;"
75,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,His voice was like wind down the chimney at night.
76,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,"""WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE?"" growled out Mrs. B----;"
77,_THE STORY OF_ THE THREE BEARS.,Her voice was like cats fighting up in a tree.
78,"""WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE AND EATEN IT ALL?""","""WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE AND EATEN IT ALL?"""
79,"""WHO HAS BEEN TO MY PORRIDGE AND EATEN IT ALL?""","Young Tiny-cub said, in a voice very small,"
80,"""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GREAT ARM CHAIR?""","""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GREAT ARM CHAIR?"""
81,"""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GREAT ARM CHAIR?""","In voice like a thunder-storm, roared the big bear."
82,"""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GOOD ARM CHAIR?""","""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GOOD ARM CHAIR?"""
83,"""WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY GOOD ARM CHAIR?""","Growled out Mammy Muff, like a sow in despair."
84,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?"""
85,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","Young Tiny-cub said, and so fierce was his frown,"
86,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","That his mother with pride to his father said, ""There!"
87,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","See our pet Tiny-cub can look just like a bear,"""
88,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","So roaring, and growling, and frowning, the bears,"
89,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","One after the other, came running up-stairs."
90,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","""WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?"" old Bruin roared out,"
91,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",In a voice just like rain down a large water-spout.
92,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","""WHO HAS BEEN UPON MY BED?"" growled out Mammy Muff,"
93,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","In a voice like her husband's, but not quite so rough."
94,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","""WHO IS LYING ON MY BED?"" said young Tiny-Cub,"
95,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",In a voice like hot water poured into a tub.
96,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","And Tiny-cub's breath was so hot as he spoke,"
97,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","That Goldenhair dreamt of hot water, and woke."
98,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","She opened her eyes, and she saw the three bears,"
99,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","And said, ""Let me go, please, I'll soon run down stairs."""
100,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","But big Bruin was angry, and shouted out, ""No!"
101,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","You had no right to come hither, and now you shan't go."
102,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","What we mean to do with you, ere long you shall find;"
103,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","You can lie there and cry till I make up my mind."""
104,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","To Mammy and Tiny then did big Bruin roar,"
105,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","""Go and block up the chimney and nail up the door;"
106,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","This Goldenhair now has got into a scrape,"
107,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","And if I can help it, she shall not escape."""
108,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","But Goldenhair saw that a window was there,"
109,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","(It was always kept open to let in fresh air),"
110,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","So she jumped out of bed--to the window she ran,"
111,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","Saying ""Three bears, good-bye! Catch me now if you can!"""
112,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","To the window the bears ran as fast as they could,"
113,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",But Goldenhair flew like the wind through the wood.
114,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","She said the bears' breath had filled her with steam,"
115,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","But when she grew older she said 'twas a dream,"
116,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",And no doubt she was right to take such a view;
117,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","Still, some part of the story is certainly true,"
118,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""","For unto this day there is no one who dares,"
119,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",To say that there never existed THREE BEARS.
120,"""WHO HAS SAT IN MY NICE CHAIR, AND BROKEN IT DOWN?""",
