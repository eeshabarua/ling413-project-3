43,JULIA WARD HOWE.,_Sweet! when first my baby ear
44,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Curled itself and learned to hear,"
45,JULIA WARD HOWE.,'Twas your silver-singing voice
46,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Made my baby heart rejoice._
47,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
48,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"_Hushed upon your tender breast,"
49,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Soft you sang me to my rest;
50,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Waking, when I sought my play,"
51,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Still your singing led the way._
52,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
53,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"_Cradle songs, more soft and low"
54,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Than the bird croons on the bough;
55,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Olden ballads, grave and gay,"
56,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Warrior's chant, and lover's lay._"
57,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
58,JULIA WARD HOWE.,_So my baby hours went
59,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"In a cadence of content,"
60,JULIA WARD HOWE.,To the music and the rhyme
61,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Keeping tune and keeping time._
62,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
63,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"_So you taught me, too, ere long,"
64,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"All our life should be a song,--"
65,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Should a faltering prelude be
66,JULIA WARD HOWE.,To the heavenly harmony;_
67,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
68,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"_And with gracious words and high,"
69,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Bade me look beyond the sky,"
70,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"To the Glory throned above,"
71,JULIA WARD HOWE.,To th' eternal Light and Love._
72,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
73,JULIA WARD HOWE.,_Many years have blossomed by:
74,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Far and far from childhood I;
75,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Yet its sunrays on me fall,"
76,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Here among my children all._
77,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
78,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"_So among my babes I go,"
79,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Singing high and singing low;
80,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Striving for the silver tone
81,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Which my memory holds alone._
82,JULIA WARD HOWE.,
83,JULIA WARD HOWE.,_If I chant my little lays
84,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"Tunefully, be yours the praise;"
85,JULIA WARD HOWE.,"If I fail, 'tis I must rue"
86,JULIA WARD HOWE.,Not t' have closelier followed you._
