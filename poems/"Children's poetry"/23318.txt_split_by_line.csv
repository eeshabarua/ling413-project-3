59,PREFACE,
60,PREFACE,"For some time past, it has arrived at"
61,PREFACE,the dignity of a popular Nursery Tale in

65,PREFACE,
66,PREFACE,"It will be worth while explaining, that"
67,PREFACE,the circle in each page is made to
68,PREFACE,represent some object in connection with
69,PREFACE,"the story; and, that as some of them"
70,PREFACE,"have proved rather puzzling, to Juvenile"
71,PREFACE,admirers has been left the task of
72,PREFACE,"""finding them out."""
