3068,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3069,THE FLOWER FOLK,Down in a green and shady bed
3070,THE FLOWER FOLK,A modest violet grew;
3071,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,"
3072,THE FLOWER FOLK,As if to hide from view.
3073,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3074,THE FLOWER FOLK,"And yet it was a lovely flower,"
3075,THE FLOWER FOLK,Its color bright and fair;
3076,THE FLOWER FOLK,It might have graced a rosy bower
3077,THE FLOWER FOLK,Instead of hiding there.
3078,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3079,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Yet there it was content to bloom,"
3080,THE FLOWER FOLK,In modest tints arrayed;
3081,THE FLOWER FOLK,And there diffused its sweet Perfume
3082,THE FLOWER FOLK,Within the silent shade.
3083,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3084,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Then let me to the valley go,"
3085,THE FLOWER FOLK,"This pretty flower to see,"

3101,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Blew keen on her face,"

3119,THE FLOWER FOLK,And then she looked round.
3120,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3121,THE FLOWER FOLK,"There was snow all about her,"
3122,THE FLOWER FOLK,Gray clouds overhead;
3123,THE FLOWER FOLK,The trees all looked dead:

3125,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Poor Daffy-down felt,"
3126,THE FLOWER FOLK,"When the sun would not shine,"
3127,THE FLOWER FOLK,And the ice would not melt?
3128,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3129,THE FLOWER FOLK,"""Cold weather!"" thought Daffy,"
3130,THE FLOWER FOLK,Still working away;
3131,THE FLOWER FOLK,"""The earth's hard to-day!"
3132,THE FLOWER FOLK,There's but a half inch
3133,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Of my leaves to be seen,"
3134,THE FLOWER FOLK,And two thirds of that
3135,THE FLOWER FOLK,Is more yellow than green.
3136,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3137,THE FLOWER FOLK,"""I can't do much yet;"

3144,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3145,THE FLOWER FOLK,"So, little by little,"
3146,THE FLOWER FOLK,"She brought her leaves out,"
3147,THE FLOWER FOLK,All clustered about;
3148,THE FLOWER FOLK,And then her bright flowers
3149,THE FLOWER FOLK,"Began to unfold,"
3150,THE FLOWER FOLK,Till Daffy stood robed
3151,THE FLOWER FOLK,In her spring green and gold.
3152,THE FLOWER FOLK,
3153,THE FLOWER FOLK,"O Daffy-down-dilly,"
3154,THE FLOWER FOLK,So brave and so true!

5001,IX,
5002,IX,Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray;
5003,IX,"And, when I crossed the wild,"
5004,IX,I chanced to see at break of day
5005,IX,The solitary child.
5006,IX,
5007,IX,"No mate, no comrade, Lucy knew;"
5008,IX,"She dwelt on a wide moor,--"
5009,IX,The sweetest thing that ever grew
5010,IX,Beside a human door!
5011,IX,
5012,IX,"You yet may spy the fawn at play,"
5013,IX,The hare upon the green;
5014,IX,But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
5015,IX,Will never more be seen.
5016,IX,
5017,IX,"""To-night will be a stormy night--"
5018,IX,You to the town must go:
5019,IX,"And take a lantern, child, to light"

5021,IX,
5022,IX,"""That, father, will I gladly do:"
5023,IX,'Tis scarcely afternoon--
5024,IX,The minster-clock has just struck two;
5025,IX,"And yonder is the moon."""
5026,IX,
5027,IX,"At this the father raised his hook,"
5028,IX,And snapped a faggot-band;
5029,IX,He plied his work;--and Lucy took
5030,IX,The lantern in her hand.
5031,IX,
5032,IX,Not blither is the mountain roe:
5033,IX,With many a wanton stroke
5034,IX,"Her feet disperse the powdery snow,"
5035,IX,That rises up like smoke.
5036,IX,
5037,IX,The storm came on before its time
5038,IX,She wandered up and down;
5039,IX,"And many a hill did Lucy climb,"
5040,IX,But never reached the town.
5041,IX,
5042,IX,The wretched parents all that night
5043,IX,Went shouting far and wide;
5044,IX,But there was neither sound nor sight
5045,IX,To serve them for a guide.
5046,IX,
5047,IX,At daybreak on a hill they stood
5048,IX,That overlooked the moor;
5049,IX,"And thence they saw the bridge of wood,"
5050,IX,A furlong from their door.
5051,IX,
5052,IX,"They wept--and, turning homeward, cried,"
5053,IX,"""In heaven we all shall meet!"""
5054,IX,When in the snow the mother spied
5055,IX,The print of Lucy's feet.
5056,IX,
5057,IX,Then downwards from the steep hill's edge
5058,IX,They tracked the footmarks small;
5059,IX,"And through the broken hawthorn hedge,"
5060,IX,And by the low stone wall:
5061,IX,
5062,IX,And then an open field they crossed;
5063,IX,The marks were still the same;
5064,IX,"They tracked them on, nor ever lost;"
5065,IX,And to the bridge they came.
5066,IX,
5067,IX,They follow from the snowy bank
5068,IX,"Those footmarks, one by one,"
5069,IX,Into the middle of the plank;
5070,IX,And further there were none!
5071,IX,
5072,IX,--Yet some maintain that to this day
5073,IX,She is a living child;
5074,IX,That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
5075,IX,Upon the lonesome wild.
5076,IX,
5077,IX,"O'er rough and smooth she trips along,"
5078,IX,And never looks behind;

5111,IX,Since first he could walk they have served him like this.

5710,STORY TIME,
5711,STORY TIME,"Down the broad stream the Fairies float,"

5718,STORY TIME,With salt and savour of the seas--
5719,STORY TIME,
5720,STORY TIME,"Still down the stream the Fairies float,"
5721,STORY TIME,An unseen power impels their boat;
5722,STORY TIME,
5723,STORY TIME,Until they mark the rushing tide
5724,STORY TIME,Within the estuary wide.
5725,STORY TIME,
5726,STORY TIME,"And now they're tossing on the sea,"

7925,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse."
7926,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,"
7927,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
7928,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"The children were nestled all snug in their beds,"
7929,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
7930,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,"
7931,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap--
7932,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
7933,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
7934,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"Away to the window I flew like a flash,"
7935,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"Tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash."
7936,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
7937,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,Gave a lustre of midday to objects below;
7938,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,When what to my wondering eyes should appear
7939,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,"
7940,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"With a little old driver, so lively and quick,"
7941,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick!
7942,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,"

7950,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"So, up to the housetop the coursers they flew,"
7951,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"With a sleigh full of toys--and St. Nicholas, too."
7952,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof"
7953,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
7954,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"As I drew in my head, and was turning around,"
7955,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:
7956,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,"
7957,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot:
7958,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,"
7959,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
7960,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!"
7961,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;"
7962,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,"
7963,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
7964,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,"
7965,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath."
7966,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,He had a broad face and a little round belly
7967,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."
7968,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf:
7969,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;"
7970,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,"
7971,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
7972,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,"
7973,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And filled all the stockings: then turned with a jerk,"
7974,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And laying his finger aside of his nose,"
7975,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose."
7976,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,"
7977,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
7978,BELLS OF CHRISTMAS,"But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,"
