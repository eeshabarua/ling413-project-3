267,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
268,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
269,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"There are two little girls living nearly a hundred rods apart, Mamie"
270,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,and Fannie. Each had a nice pet cat.
271,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
272,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,Mamie's cat had three little kittens. When they were about three weeks
273,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,old their poor mother was killed by a useless dog. For two days Mamie
274,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"fed her kittens with a spoon, and did all she could to comfort them;"
275,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,but they would cry for their mother.
276,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
277,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"Fannie's cat had only one kitten, and it died at once. Then Mamie took"
278,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,her three motherless kittens down to Fannie's cat to see if she would
279,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"adopt them. She took them at once, and made a great fuss over them."
280,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,Then she was allowed to raise them.
281,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
282,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,When Mamie thought her kittens were old enough she took all three of
283,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,them home again. But their stepmother would neither eat nor drink. She
284,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,cried and looked for the kittens. At last Fannie carried her cat up to
285,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,Mamie's house to see the kittens. Then mother and kittens were all
286,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"happy again, and played together as if they had never been separated."
287,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
288,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,When the girls saw how much the cat and kittens were attached to each
289,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,other they concluded to take Fannie's cat home again with only two of
290,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"the kittens; in a short time bring back one of them, and later the"
291,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,last one. In this way they thought they could separate them without
292,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,any trouble.
293,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,
294,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,Fannie's cat was not pleased with this plan. She began to look for and
295,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"call the third kitten. The next morning, when Mamie went to feed her"
296,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"one kitten, she could not find it anywhere about the barn or woodshed."
297,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"She went down to Fannie's house, and there she found her kitten."
298,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"Sometime in the night Fannie's cat went to Mamie's house, found the"
299,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"kitten, and carried it home. Since that time the girls have not tried"
300,THE KITTENS' STEPMOTHER.,"to part the cat and kittens, and they are a happy family."

314,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,Many noble oak-trees are planted by the little squirrel. Running up

318,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,often grow up into great and beautiful trees.
319,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,
320,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,"The nuthatch, too, among the birds, is a great planter. After"
321,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,twisting off a cluster of beech-nuts this queer little bird carries
322,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,"them to some favorite tree, and pegs them into the crevices of the"
323,HOW SOME SEEDS ARE PLANTED.,"bark in a curious way. How, we cannot tell. After a while they fall to"

459,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,
460,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,"When he came back he tied his horse, and set out to find the little"

484,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,
485,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,"He went nearer, expecting to see a woodchuck again; but there were"

494,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,
495,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,Then Mr. Nash went and called a man to help him. They took spades and

497,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,
498,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,"They carried them up to the farm-yard, and put them into a pen. They"

502,NINE LITTLE FOXES.,"Mr. Nash said he did not want to kill them, because they were so"

518,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
519,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,It was the first day of school after a vacation. The children were
520,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,playing in the yards. The teachers sat at their desks waiting for the
521,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,bell to strike to call the children to the different rooms. The hands
522,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,of the different clocks pointed to a quarter before nine.
523,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
524,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"The bell was a sort of gong, fastened to the outside of the building,"
525,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,and the master of the school could ring it by touching a knob in the
526,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,wall near his desk. It was now time to call the children into school.
527,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,The master pulled the bell and waited. Still the merry shouts could be
528,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,heard in the school-yards. Very strange! The children were so engaged
529,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"in play that they could not hear the bell, he thought. Then he pulled"
530,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,it more vigorously. Still the shouts and laughter continued.
531,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
532,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"The master raised his window, clapped his hands, and pointed to the"
533,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,bell.

535,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,[Illustration: {THE MASTER LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW.}]
536,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
537,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"The children rushed into line like little soldiers, and waited for the"
538,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"second signal. The teacher pulled and pulled, but there was no sound."
539,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"Then he sent a boy to tell each line to file in, and he sent another"
540,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,boy for a carpenter to find out if the bell-cord was broken.
541,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
542,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,[Illustration: {A BOY CLEARS THE EMPTY NEST AWAY FROM THE BELL.}]
543,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
544,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,What do you think the carpenter found? A little sparrow had built its
545,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"nest inside the bell, and prevented the hammer striking against the"
546,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"bell. The teacher told the children what the trouble was, and asked if"
547,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"the nest should be taken out. There was a loud chorus of ""No, sir."""
548,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,
549,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,Every day the four hundred children would gather in the yard and look
550,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,up at the nest. When the little birds were able to fly to the trees in
551,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,"the yard, and no longer needed a nest, one of the boys climbed on a"
552,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,ladder and cleared away the straw and hay so that the sound of the
553,WHAT AILED THE BELL.,bell might call the children from play.

855,WHERE THE PRETTY PATH LED.,At last Frank said they must wade for them. He and Fred took off their

1352,SAILOR BABIES.,there are? I am very sorry you could not count them all. And such
1353,SAILOR BABIES.,queer fellows many of them are! There are butcher-birds and
1354,SAILOR BABIES.,"tailor-birds, soldier-birds--the penguins, you know, who stand on the"
1355,SAILOR BABIES.,"sea-shore like companies of soldiers, ""heads up, eyes front, arms"
1356,SAILOR BABIES.,"(meaning wings) at the sides""--and sailor-birds. It is about one of"
1357,SAILOR BABIES.,the sailor-birds and his babies that I am going to tell you now. She
1358,SAILOR BABIES.,"is called the Little Grebe, or sometimes, by her intimate friends, the"
1359,SAILOR BABIES.,"Dabchick. She is a pretty little bird, about nine inches long, with"
1360,SAILOR BABIES.,"brown head and back, and grayish-white breast. She and her husband are"
1361,SAILOR BABIES.,"both extremely fond of the water. ""We are first cousins to the"
1362,SAILOR BABIES.,"Divers!"" they sometimes say proudly. ""The Divers are never happy away"
1363,SAILOR BABIES.,"from the water, and neither are we. It is very vulgar to live on land"
1364,SAILOR BABIES.,"all the time. One might almost as well have four legs, and be a"
1365,SAILOR BABIES.,"creature at once!"" (The Divers are a very proud family, and speak of"
1366,SAILOR BABIES.,"all quadrupeds as ""creatures."") Mr. and Mrs. Grebe have very"
1367,SAILOR BABIES.,"curiously webbed feet, looking more like a horse-chestnut leaf with"
1368,SAILOR BABIES.,three lobes than anything else. They are excellent swimmers and
1369,SAILOR BABIES.,"divers; indeed, in diving, the Great Northern Diver himself is not so"
1370,SAILOR BABIES.,"quick and alert. If anything frightens them, pop! they are under the"
1371,SAILOR BABIES.,water in the shaking of a feather; and you may sometimes see them in a
1372,SAILOR BABIES.,"pond, popping up and down like little absurd Jacks-in-the-box. As they"
1373,SAILOR BABIES.,"think the land so very vulgar, of course they do not want to bring up"
1374,SAILOR BABIES.,their children on it.

1378,SAILOR BABIES.,"Oh, dear, no! They find a pleasant, quiet stream, or pond, where there"
1379,SAILOR BABIES.,"are plenty of reeds and rushes growing in the water, and where there"
1380,SAILOR BABIES.,"is no danger of their being disturbed by ""creatures."" Then they go to"
1381,SAILOR BABIES.,"work and make a raft, a regular raft, of strong stems of water-plants,"
1382,SAILOR BABIES.,"reeds, and arrow-heads, plaited and woven together with great care and"
1383,SAILOR BABIES.,"skill. It is light enough to float, and yet strong enough to bear the"
1384,SAILOR BABIES.,weight of the mother-bird.
1385,SAILOR BABIES.,
1386,SAILOR BABIES.,"While she is building it she sits, or stands, on another and more"
1387,SAILOR BABIES.,"roughly built raft, which is not meant to hold together long. Mr."
1388,SAILOR BABIES.,"Grebe helps her, pulling up the water-plants and cutting off the stems"
1389,SAILOR BABIES.,the right length; and so this little couple work away till the
1390,SAILOR BABIES.,"raft-nest is quite ready. Then Mrs. Grebe takes her place on it, and"
1391,SAILOR BABIES.,"proceeds to lay and hatch her eggs. There are five or six eggs, and"
1392,SAILOR BABIES.,they are white when she lays them; but they do not keep their
1393,SAILOR BABIES.,"whiteness long, for the water-weeds and the leaves that cover the"
1394,SAILOR BABIES.,"raft soon decay, and stain the pretty white eggs, so that they are"
1395,SAILOR BABIES.,"muddy brown by the time they are hatched. Well, there little Madame"
1396,SAILOR BABIES.,"Grebe sits, brooding contentedly over her eggs, and thinking how"
1397,SAILOR BABIES.,"carefully she will bring up her children, so that they will be a"
1398,SAILOR BABIES.,"credit to the family of the Divers. Mr. Grebe paddles, and dives and"
1399,SAILOR BABIES.,"pops up and down about the nest, and brings her all sorts of good"
1400,SAILOR BABIES.,"things to eat,--worms for dinner, minnows for supper, and for"
1401,SAILOR BABIES.,breakfast the most delicate and appetizing of flies and beetles. One
1402,SAILOR BABIES.,"day, when he brings his wife's dinner (a fine stickle-back), he finds"
1403,SAILOR BABIES.,her in a state of great excitement.
1404,SAILOR BABIES.,
1405,SAILOR BABIES.,"""My dear,"" she says, ""I am going to move. I cannot endure this place"
1406,SAILOR BABIES.,"another hour. I only waited to tell you about it."""
1407,SAILOR BABIES.,
1408,SAILOR BABIES.,"""Why, what is the matter, my love?"" asks Mr. Grebe, in amazement."
1409,SAILOR BABIES.,
1410,SAILOR BABIES.,"""Some creatures have been here,"" answers little madam,"
1411,SAILOR BABIES.,"indignantly,--""huge, ugly monsters, with horns; cows, I believe they"
1412,SAILOR BABIES.,"are called. They have torn up the reeds, and muddied the water; and,"
1413,SAILOR BABIES.,"if you will believe it, Dabchick, one of them nearly walked right over"
1414,SAILOR BABIES.,"me; then I flew in his face, and gave him a good fright, I can tell"
1415,SAILOR BABIES.,"you. But the whole thing has upset me very much, and I am determined"
1416,SAILOR BABIES.,"to leave the place."""
1417,SAILOR BABIES.,

1420,SAILOR BABIES.,
1421,SAILOR BABIES.,"Accordingly, when she has finished her dinner, Mrs. Grebe puts one"
1422,SAILOR BABIES.,"foot into the water, and paddles her raft away as skilfully as if she"
1423,SAILOR BABIES.,"were an Indian in a birch canoe. She steers it round the corners, and"
1424,SAILOR BABIES.,"paddles on and on, till she finds another quiet nook, where there is"
1425,SAILOR BABIES.,"no sign of any ""creatures."" Then she draws in her paddle-foot, and"
1426,SAILOR BABIES.,"broods quietly again, while Mr. Grebe, who has followed her, goes to"
1427,SAILOR BABIES.,"explore the new surroundings, and see what he can pick up for supper."
1428,SAILOR BABIES.,
1429,SAILOR BABIES.,"After a time the muddy brown eggs crack open one by one, and out come"

1899,THE COUNTRY WEEK.,
1900,THE COUNTRY WEEK.,Lina spent most of the next day in the garden. She helped pick the

2201,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2202,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2203,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,Something very strange happened at our house the other day. In our
2204,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,cold country we keep a stove in our sitting-room all summer. Sometimes
2205,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"we have to build a fire, even in July and August."
2206,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2207,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,One afternoon I was surprised to hear a great scratching in the room.
2208,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"After looking about a little, I found it came from the stove. Scratch,"
2209,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"scratch, scratch, as if some creature was trying hard to get out. I"
2210,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"called my boy of eight years. For a few moments all was still, and we"
2211,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,concluded the poor thing had got out as it had come in.
2212,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2213,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,But we were mistaken; soon came that same clattering noise again. We
2214,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,removed the top of the stove and peeped in; nothing was to be seen in
2215,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,the darkness. We then made bold to open the door and poke about; but
2216,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"with no better result. After listening, we decided that the creature"
2217,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,was between the lining and outside.
2218,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2219,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,But how were we to get at it? Annie came in from the kitchen armed
2220,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,with a poker. We took out the damper and poked out all the soot and
2221,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"ashes. We brought to the front--what do you think? Why, a little bird,"
2222,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"a chimney swallow, chirping and fluttering, poor thing, with fright."
2223,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2224,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,One wing seemed to droop a little; so we took it up and put it in a
2225,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,box. If we supposed it was going to stay there we were much mistaken.
2226,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"Soon the bird began to recover, and with a little hop was upon the"
2227,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"edge of the box cocking its head and looking with its big, bright eyes"
2228,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"all about, as if on the alert for any new danger."
2229,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2230,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"A tree was the best and safest place, and Hervin carried it out and"
2231,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,set it gently down.
2232,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2233,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"It rose, feebly at first, then soared away over the tops of the"
2234,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,houses.
2235,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,
2236,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,"Wasn't that a queer place to find a birdie? You are glad it got out,"
2237,WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR STOVE.,for that very night we had to have a fire.

2248,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,
2249,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,John and Lincoln have a fleet of ten boats. They made these boats
2250,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,themselves. They are made out of flat chips. They are whittled round
2251,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,at one end and pointed at the other. Each boat has a mast and a sail.
2252,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,
2253,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"Sometimes they tie these boats together, and call them the _John and"
2254,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"Lincoln_ fleet; they call each other ""Captain John"" and ""Captain"
2255,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"Lincoln."" They have a big boat called the _Mary_; aunt Mary gave it to"
2256,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,them. The _Mary_ is their flagship.

2259,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,
2260,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"One day the fleet were all out when a storm came. The wind blew, the"
2261,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"rain fell, and the waves were big. Six of the little boats were"
2262,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,wrecked on a rock. But the _Mary_ only plunged a little. It was great
2263,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,"fun. What, a storm at sea great fun! Yes, because John and Lincoln"
2264,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,made the storm themselves. They made the wind with the bellows; they
2265,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,poured the big raindrops from the watering-pot; and they made the high
2266,THE JOHN AND LINCOLN FLEET.,waves by dragging shingles through the water.

2274,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"The _Starlight_ was in Gloucester harbor for three days, and Rob and"
2275,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"Phyllis went on board with mamma one day, to lunch with Arthur and"
2276,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,Helen and their mamma. They had never been on a yacht before. They
2277,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,were surprised to find it so pretty. It was finished in beautiful
2278,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"mahogany with a great deal of brass-work, the latter brightly shining,"
2279,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"too, for the housekeeping on a yacht is always first-rate."
2280,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2281,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"The ceiling of the cabin was of blue satin, and so were the curtains,"
2282,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"which hung before the funny little windows, and at the doors. On each"
2283,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,side of the cabin was a long seat covered with blue satin cushions.
2284,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2285,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"These cushions lifted up, and underneath were kept books, dishes,"
2286,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"clothes, in fact, all sorts of things. Every bit of room on a vessel"
2287,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"is always precious, there can be so little of it, anyway. Helen showed"
2288,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"Phyllis her sleeping room. It was a mite of a place, about half as big"
2289,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,as the bed Phyllis slept in at home. The walls were lined with blue
2290,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"satin and the bed was covered with blue satin, and it was a real blue"
2291,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"satin nest for a little girl, instead of for a bird."
2292,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2293,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"Then they went on deck to watch the sailors, who were running up and"
2294,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"down the rigging. Arthur has been on his father's yacht so much, for"
2295,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"his father owns the _Starlight_, that he can run up and down the"
2296,THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,ratlines almost as fast as the sailors can. The ratlines are the rope

2310,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,Once when he went on a voyage a little kitten went too. She was

2314,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,that poor Gil had to go away and play by himself.
2315,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2316,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,One day kitty fell overboard and Gil saw her and plunged into the sea
2317,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"to save her. Kitty thought it was bad enough to fall into the water,"
2318,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"but to see Gil come jumping after her was too much, and she was ready"
2319,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,to die with fright.
2320,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2321,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"When he opened his great mouth to take her and hold her above water,"
2322,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"she felt sure that her last moment had come, and she fought and"

2324,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2325,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,The officers stood watching Gil and pussy. Poor little mistaken pussy
2326,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,was getting very tired and would soon sink if she did not let good old

2328,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,
2329,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,Suddenly Gil dove down out of sight and then rose again just under
2330,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"kitty, so that she stood on his back. Puss was so glad to feel"
2331,THE STORY OF THE DOG ON THE YACHT STARLIGHT.,"something solid under her little tired legs, that she clung to it with"

2377,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,He lived almost all his life in Africa. In some parts of Africa there

2390,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,
2391,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,He heard the men shout. He turned and saw the lion all ready to

2396,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,"The lion sprang upon Livingstone, and seized his shoulder with his"

2398,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,
2399,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,Was Livingstone frightened? He was frightened when the lion seized

2401,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,
2402,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,He said the lion shook the fear all out of him. He felt as if he was

2404,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,
2405,THE MAN WHO WAS SHAKEN BY A LION.,He did not do anything next. He stood with his great paw on

2469,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,Jocko was homesick. Jocko was a forest creature. He was born to tread

2472,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"Jocko liked to leap from tree to tree, and run about over miles of"

2475,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2476,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"He could see only blue waves, and the ropes and masts and sails of the"

2479,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2480,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"After many days, he saw the land again. But it was not forest land. It"

2482,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,flowers! All stone and brick! His cage was carried into a hotel
2483,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"dining-room where people came and sat down and talked in German, and"
2484,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,ate things that Jocko knew were not good to eat--bread and pies and

2487,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2488,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"But by and by Jocko was not so homesick. The cook was kind to him, and"

2495,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,But one day little Gretchen played a trick on him to see what he would

2497,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,with lumps of sugar. Then she gave it to Jocko.
2498,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2499,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,Jocko was wild with delight when he saw the sugar. He jumped up in a

2501,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2502,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,But Gretchen had put in a cork. The sugar would not pour out.
2503,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2504,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,It was very funny then to see what trouble Jocko was in. He would
2505,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,tilt the bottle up and try to drink the sugar out of the neck. Then he
2506,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,would try to shake it out at the bottom. Then he would sit still and
2507,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,look at the lumps. Then he would try to bite through the glass. Then
2508,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,he would jump down and run away. Then he would come back and catch the
2509,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"bottle again and roll the lumps about, and chatter and scold as he"
2510,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,heard them rattle.
2511,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2512,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,This went on for several days. Everybody came in to see little

2519,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,"Like a flash, up he sprang to a high cupboard with his sugar bottle,"

2527,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,
2528,THE TRICK THEY PLAYED ON JOCKO.,He would seize every bottle and can and pitcher that was left within

2548,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,They sit and float upon the water. They run about over the water. In

2550,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2551,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,Bobby's mamma told him many things about the stormy petrel. She told
2552,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,"him how the stormy petrel flies far, far away from land. His home is"
2553,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,on the sea. He can fly all day long and not be tired.
2554,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2555,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,The stormy petrel hardly ever goes on land except to lay her eggs. Her
2556,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,nest is in a hole in some high cliff by the sea. She hatches one
2557,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,little bird. It looks like a ball of fluff. The nest smells very oily.
2558,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2559,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,"The stormy petrel is very oily, like all sea birds. He is so full of"

2561,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,They take a dead petrel and run a wick through him. Then they set him

2568,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,It was a bird's nest. It was built in the rigging of a ship.
2569,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2570,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,This ship had been lying in port a good while. The nest was built in
2571,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,a block where some of the cordage runs. It was built by a pair of
2572,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,chaffinches.
2573,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2574,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,Now the chaffinch is not a sea bird; it is a land bird. It builds its
2575,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,nest in trees and hedges. It builds a cosey little nest out of moss
2576,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,and wool and hair. It is deep and round like a cup.
2577,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,
2578,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,But this pretty pair of chaffinches found a new place in which to
2579,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,build their nest. It was even more airy than the top of a tree. See it
2580,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,in the picture! Day by day Bobby watched them as they flew busily to
2581,SOME OTHER THINGS BOBBY SAW AT SEA.,and fro. Many other people watched them too.

2599,THE MOSQUITO.,
2600,THE MOSQUITO.,It is the female mosquito that sings around our heads at night and

2605,THE MOSQUITO.,
2606,THE MOSQUITO.,She lays her eggs in a very queer way. First she finds a puddle or a

2610,THE MOSQUITO.,
2611,THE MOSQUITO.,"The eggs cling together in the shape of a boat or canoe, and float"

2665,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,There were seven ducklings. The very first thing they did was to go
2666,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,and tumble into a bucket of water.
2667,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2668,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"""Cluck-cluck-cluck! quaw-aw-awk! cr-r-r!"" said the hen-mother. She was"

2670,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,hawk.
2671,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2672,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,She thought they would all drown. But they didn't. They swam and dove
2673,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,and shook the water from their little wings.
2674,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2675,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"One day when they were about a quarter grown, Annie found"
2676,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,Fluffy-dumpty lying on the ground; she was quacking faintly. Her leg

2678,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2679,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"""O papa! mend her leg just as you did my arm!"" she said."
2680,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2681,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,Papa is a doctor; and when Annie was a _very_ little girl she broke
2682,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,her arm and papa mended it. So he did up Fluffy-dumpty's leg with a
2683,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"splinter, and then wound a bandage round it. Annie took care of her."
2684,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,Mary used to help Annie feed her with a spoon.
2685,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2686,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,Fluffy-dumpty got well very fast. But when she was about three
2687,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"quarters grown, she met with another accident. She fell down a steep"

2689,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2690,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"""Quack-quack! Take me out! Oh, take me out!"" cried poor Fluffy-dumpty."

2693,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,"""We can't! we can't!"" they cried. ""We haven't got any hands. Call a"

2695,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,
2696,ANNIE'S DUCKS.,How thankful Fluffy-dumpty was! She smoothed down her ruffled feathers

3253,FINNETTE.,
3254,FINNETTE.,
3255,FINNETTE.,"""Bow-wow-wow!"" was the first thing Winny heard that morning. She"
3256,FINNETTE.,opened her eyes and there stood Finnette. Aunt Bertha had brought her
3257,FINNETTE.,as a birthday gift for Winny from Paris.
3258,FINNETTE.,
3259,FINNETTE.,Finnette was full of pretty tricks. She could stand on her hind legs
3260,FINNETTE.,and dance. She could sing.
3261,FINNETTE.,
3262,FINNETTE.,"""Now, Finnette,"" Winny's mamma would say, ""I will play and you shall"
3263,FINNETTE.,"sing."""
3264,FINNETTE.,
3265,FINNETTE.,[Illustration: WINNY.]
3266,FINNETTE.,
3267,FINNETTE.,So Finnette would stand on her hind legs and sing such a droll little
3268,FINNETTE.,"tune. It sounded like ""I love--I love--I love--do you?"" Finnette"
3269,FINNETTE.,always helped Winny to put her dolls to bed. It was wonderful to see
3270,FINNETTE.,her.
3271,FINNETTE.,
3272,FINNETTE.,"""Bring me Grandma Snowhair's cap, Finnette,"" Winny would say. And"
3273,FINNETTE.,Finnette would trot off and fetch it. She knew the doll's clothes just
3274,FINNETTE.,as well as Winny did.
3275,FINNETTE.,
3276,FINNETTE.,"""Now, Finnette, I will have Glorianna's nightgown,"" said Winny again,"
3277,FINNETTE.,and Finnette would bring it.
3278,FINNETTE.,
3279,FINNETTE.,"When Winny got her dolls in bed, she always sang them to sleep, and"
3280,FINNETTE.,"then Finnette would sing too. ""I love--I love--I love--do you?"""
3281,FINNETTE.,
3282,FINNETTE.,Mamma used to like to peep in and see them. Winny always put her dolls
3283,FINNETTE.,to bed at five o'clock. Finnette always knew when the clock struck
3284,FINNETTE.,"five, and off she would run to find Winny."
3285,FINNETTE.,
3286,FINNETTE.,But one day she couldn't find her. She searched through the house and
3287,FINNETTE.,"garden, but Winny was not to be found. So Finnette lay down in the"
3288,FINNETTE.,"library, and waited. Once she got up and trotted in and looked at the"
3289,FINNETTE.,"dolls. She barked softly, as though she would say, ""Be patient; your"
3290,FINNETTE.,"mamma will be here soon."""
3291,FINNETTE.,
3292,FINNETTE.,But the little mamma did not come; so Finnette concluded to put the
3293,FINNETTE.,dolls to bed herself. She laid Grandma Snowhair on the floor and then
3294,FINNETTE.,with her teeth and paws she gently drew off her cap and gray silk
3295,FINNETTE.,"dress. She put on her nightgown, but she could not button it."
3296,FINNETTE.,
3297,FINNETTE.,"She undressed Glorianna, but she got her nightgown on upside down. She"
3298,FINNETTE.,put her legs into the sleeves. She did not try to put on aunt Sukey's
3299,FINNETTE.,nightgown. She just wrapped her up in a blanket.
3300,FINNETTE.,
3301,FINNETTE.,She tumbled the four small dolls into their beds anyhow. How surprised
3302,FINNETTE.,and pleased and amused Winny was when she came home! There were the
3303,FINNETTE.,"dolls fast asleep, and their clothes all piled on a chair; and there"
3304,FINNETTE.,"sat Finnette watching them. She gave the happiest little ""bow-wow,"""
3305,FINNETTE.,when she saw Winny. She had not been able to eat or to sleep with the
3306,FINNETTE.,care of all those dolls on her mind. Winny hugged and kissed her.
3307,FINNETTE.,
3308,FINNETTE.,[Illustration: THERE STOOD--FINNETTE!]
3309,FINNETTE.,
3310,FINNETTE.,"""You dear old darling Finnette,"" she said. ""How sweet you have been to"
3311,FINNETTE.,"my children. You shall have a silver collar, for you are my best"

3606,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3607,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3608,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,Mr. Allen's early apples were almost ripe. They were uncommonly pretty
3609,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"apples--yellow, streaked with red. How tempting they looked! Ripe"
3610,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,apples in August are always tempting.
3611,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3612,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"Mr. Allen knew that, so he had put up a sign to warn the boys off. For"
3613,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,boys were very apt to help themselves to ripe apples. Somehow they
3614,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,think that taking a few apples is not stealing.
3615,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3616,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"So, as I said, Mr. Allen put up a board with these words on"
3617,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"it--""Trespassers prosecuted."" That meant, if he caught any boy near"
3618,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"his apple-tree, he would carry him off to a justice of the peace, for"
3619,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,stealing.
3620,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3621,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,Early one morning Tommy Tilden was walking through the lane. He had
3622,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,just driven the cows to pasture and was coming home. He stopped and
3623,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"looked at the apples. How good they did look, to be sure!"
3624,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3625,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,He searched on the ground to see if any had dropped into the lane.
3626,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"But he could not find one. Then he looked at the tree again. ""I wish I"
3627,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"had one,"" he thought."
3628,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3629,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"Ah, Tommy, Tommy, the best thing for you to do is to run away as fast"
3630,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,as you can!
3631,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3632,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,But Tommy didn't do any such thing. He kept looking at the apples and
3633,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"wishing he had one. Then he thought, ""I'll just climb up and look at"
3634,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"them."""
3635,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3636,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"And now, of course, you can guess what happened. Tommy climbed up, and"
3637,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,tried the apples with his thumb to see if they were ripe. Then he
3638,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"reached out to get a fine big one, and the branch broke, and over he"
3639,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"went, with the branch, and the sign, and a shower of apples, into Mr."
3640,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,Allen's garden.
3641,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3642,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"The dog ran out barking furiously, and Mr. Allen, who was just eating"
3643,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"his breakfast, came out too, and little May Allen, to see what was the"
3644,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,matter.
3645,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3646,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"How ashamed Tommy felt! ""Trying to steal some of my apples, were you,"
3647,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"eh?"" said Mr. Allen, and Tommy could not answer a word."
3648,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3649,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"Little May Allen felt very sorry for him. ""Can't you give him some"
3650,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"apples, papa?"" she said."
3651,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3652,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,"""No,"" said Mr. Allen; ""if he had come and asked me I would have given"

3655,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,
3656,TOMMY'S TEMPTATION.,So Tommy picked up his hat and went home. He told his mother all about

3668,A BEAR STORY.,
3669,A BEAR STORY.,"When mother was a young girl, she taught school in Illinois. Very few"
3670,A BEAR STORY.,people lived there at that time. The settlements were far apart. The
3671,A BEAR STORY.,"schoolhouse was built of rough logs, and the chinks were filled with"
3672,A BEAR STORY.,"clay and straw. Instead of glass windows, they had oiled paper to let"
3673,A BEAR STORY.,in the light.
3674,A BEAR STORY.,
3675,A BEAR STORY.,"One night mother staid late at the schoolhouse, to help the girls trim"
3676,A BEAR STORY.,it with evergreens. It was almost dark when she started for home. She
3677,A BEAR STORY.,"walked very fast, as she felt lonely. Her way lay through a thick,"
3678,A BEAR STORY.,"tall woods, and the path was narrow."
3679,A BEAR STORY.,
3680,A BEAR STORY.,All at once she saw a big animal in front of her. What was it? A calf?
3681,A BEAR STORY.,No; it was a big black bear.
3682,A BEAR STORY.,
3683,A BEAR STORY.,Was she afraid? Of course she was afraid. Shouldn't you be afraid if
3684,A BEAR STORY.,"you met a big bear in the woods? She had an umbrella in her hand, and"
3685,A BEAR STORY.,"she held the point close to the bear's nose, and opened and shut it as"
3686,A BEAR STORY.,fast as she could. She called him all the bad names she could think
3687,A BEAR STORY.,"of, and he walked off, growling."
3688,A BEAR STORY.,
3689,A BEAR STORY.,"He was a brave bear, wasn't he, to be afraid of an umbrella? Mother"
3690,A BEAR STORY.,"hurried on, and just as she got to the edge of the woods, out he came"
3691,A BEAR STORY.,"again. Then she opened the umbrella at him again, and shouted as loud"
3692,A BEAR STORY.,"as she could, and away he went."
3693,A BEAR STORY.,
3694,A BEAR STORY.,Mother was so tired and frightened she almost fainted when she got
3695,A BEAR STORY.,"home. ""I don't believe it was a bear; it must have been neighbor"
3696,A BEAR STORY.,"Clapp's big heifer,"" grandma said."
3697,A BEAR STORY.,
3698,A BEAR STORY.,"But just as she said it, they heard a loud squeal. They ran to the"
3699,A BEAR STORY.,"door, and there was the bear carrying off a pig. He had jumped into"
3700,A BEAR STORY.,the pen and got it.

3707,A BEAR STORY.,"men heard about the bear they said. ""We must kill him as soon as"
3708,A BEAR STORY.,"possible."""
3709,A BEAR STORY.,
3710,A BEAR STORY.,So they had a great hunt for him. They hunted all that night and the
3711,A BEAR STORY.,"next day. They found him, at last, sitting upon the stump of a hollow"

3713,A BEAR STORY.,
3714,A BEAR STORY.,What do you think they found in the hollow stump? Three little cubs.

3939,GOOD OLD ROSE.,"""Let me go!"" said Lily. But Rose pulled her back hard. Lily looked up"

3941,GOOD OLD ROSE.,"shake the ground. ""You shall let me go!"" cried Lily. ""Bad Rose!"" and"
3942,GOOD OLD ROSE.,"she jerked the dress, and tore it out of Rose's teeth, and ran. Then"

3946,GOOD OLD ROSE.,Just that instant the train thundered round the curve. But Lily was

3961,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,Aunt Patty lives in a little bit of a house. It has only two rooms. In
3962,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,"summer it is covered with vines--grapevines, morning glories and"

3969,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,"the yard, out would fly Gypsy, barking furiously. But he would not"

3971,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,
3972,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,"Then, when you opened the door, a sharp little voice would say"

3985,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,Where did aunt Patty get so many pets? They were given to her.
3986,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,Everybody knows that she likes pets. A sailor cousin once brought her
3987,AUNT PATTY'S PETS.,a turtle. It is quite big enough for you to ride on. This turtle lives

4005,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4006,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,Tommy sometimes visits his old nurse. Nurse lives in a tiny house and
4007,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,keeps geese. Tommy is afraid of the geese. The gander hisses at him
4008,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,and Tommy does not like that.
4009,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4010,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,One day Nurse went into the goose-house and brought out ten little
4011,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,goslings. Tommy took one of them in his hands. How pretty they were
4012,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,with their pink feet and fluffy white feathers!
4013,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4014,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""To-morrow, they will go out and eat the tender grass,"" said Nurse."
4015,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4016,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""Then I shall catch them,"" said Tommy."
4017,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4018,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""The old gander won't let you,"" said Nurse."
4019,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4020,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""Pooh! who's afraid?"" said Tommy very bravely."
4021,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4022,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,So the next day Tommy tried to catch a gosling. Nurse had gone down
4023,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,cellar and the gander was in the goose-house. But the mother-goose
4024,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,hissed and the gander heard her and flew out of the goose-house after
4025,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,Tommy.
4026,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4027,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"Tommy ran, but the gander caught hold of his clothes and began to beat"
4028,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"Tommy's legs with his wings. The old goose screamed, and Tommy ran and"
4029,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"screamed, and the gander ran and screamed and whipped. What a noise"
4030,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,they made! and Nurse ran up from the cellar to see what the matter
4031,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,was.
4032,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4033,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,Just as Tommy went up the steps the gander bit both his red stockings.
4034,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,Nurse picked Tommy up and shut the door so the gander could not get
4035,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"in. Then she kissed Tommy, and cuddled him, and laughed, and said,"
4036,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""Who's afraid?"""
4037,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4038,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""I am,"" sobbed Tommy. ""And I want that old gander shut up in the"
4039,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"barn. He isn't good for anything."""
4040,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4041,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"""Oh, yes, he is,"" said Nurse, ""he takes care of the goslings."""
4042,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4043,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,The next day Tommy saw something very pretty. He was looking over the
4044,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,gate. He did not dare to go out for fear the gander would bite him
4045,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"again. He heard a gosling cry ""peep, peep."" The goose and gander heard"
4046,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"it too, and ran and looked down into a deep hole."
4047,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,
4048,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"Tommy used to play this hole was his ""well."" Tommy saw the gander"
4049,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,stretch his long neck down into the hole and lift out a little
4050,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"gosling, and put it carefully on the grass. Then the mother goose was"
4051,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,so pleased that she screamed outright.

4053,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,[Illustration: TOMMY'S NURSE.]

4055,TOMMY AND THE GANDER.,"And Tommy screamed too. ""O Nurse, Nurse, that gander is good for"

4071,A NIGHT VISITOR.,
4072,A NIGHT VISITOR.,"""A bat! a bat!"" shrieked aunt Mary, and ran behind the door. Mamma"

4076,A NIGHT VISITOR.,
4077,A NIGHT VISITOR.,"The poor little bat fluttered about, and almost fell into the kerosene"

4295,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4296,KITTY'S TRAMP.,One cold day in January Kitty Blake had dined with grandma and was on
4297,KITTY'S TRAMP.,her way home through the fields. Perhaps you wonder why Kitty should
4298,KITTY'S TRAMP.,walk in the fields when the snow was so deep. But there was a hard
4299,KITTY'S TRAMP.,crust on the snow and she could skip along over it without breaking
4300,KITTY'S TRAMP.,through. It was great fun.
4301,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4302,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"Suddenly she stopped, for there in a slight hollow in the snow lay a"
4303,KITTY'S TRAMP.,tiny bird.
4304,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4305,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""Poor little birdie, it must have frozen to death,"" said Kitty softly,"
4306,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"and a tear stood in her eye, for she has a tender heart for all little"
4307,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"creatures. Then she said ""Oh!"" and gave a start that sent the tears"
4308,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"tumbling over her muff for just that instant, one of the bird's legs"
4309,KITTY'S TRAMP.,twitched and the tears would not stay back.
4310,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4311,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""P'r'aps it's still alive, after all;"" she thought, and she picked it"
4312,KITTY'S TRAMP.,up and tucked it into her muff. Her muff was lined with fur.
4313,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4314,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"She reached home quite breathless, and when she took out the bird and"
4315,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"laid it on mamma's lap, it gave one little ""Peep!"" stood on its legs,"
4316,KITTY'S TRAMP.,and then flew up into the ivy that ran all about the south bay window.
4317,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4318,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""What made it make b'lieve dead?"" asked Kitty."
4319,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4320,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""It didn't make believe,"" said mamma. ""I think it was dizzy. Birds"
4321,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"sometimes are dizzy. But if you had not found it, it would soon have"
4322,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"frozen to death."""
4323,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4324,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"Kitty named him ""The Tramp,"" and he lived in the bay window with"
4325,KITTY'S TRAMP.,mamma's plants. This bay window was shut off from the rest of the room
4326,KITTY'S TRAMP.,by glass doors. It was a sunny and fragrant home for the little
4327,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"chickadee, and a lucky bird he was to have it just then."
4328,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4329,KITTY'S TRAMP.,For on the first day of February it began to snow and snowed three
4330,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"days, and when it cleared there were piles and piles of snow."
4331,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4332,KITTY'S TRAMP.,Great flocks of birds then came about the house searching for food.
4333,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4334,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""We must feed them or they will die,"" said mamma. ""The snow is so deep"
4335,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"they cannot find food."""
4336,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4337,KITTY'S TRAMP.,So Kitty scattered meal and hemp seed on the snow and tied meaty bones
4338,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"on the lilac and rose bushes, and there wasn't a moment of the day"
4339,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"when some blue jay, or snow bird, or chickadee, or robin, was not"
4340,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"picking up grain, or pecking at the bones."
4341,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4342,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""That is the way to have birds in winter!"" said Kitty."
4343,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4344,KITTY'S TRAMP.,The Tramp did not seem to care a fig about his relations till one day
4345,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"in March when a flock of chickadees flew past, and he fluttered"
4346,KITTY'S TRAMP.,against the windows and begged to be let out.
4347,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4348,KITTY'S TRAMP.,[Illustration: THE TRAMP VISITS CHARLEY.]
4349,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4350,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"Mamma opened the window and off he flew! Kitty sighed and said, ""That"
4351,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"is the last of him, I suppose."" But it wasn't."
4352,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4353,KITTY'S TRAMP.,One sunny May day Charley was sitting up in bed. Charley is Kitty's
4354,KITTY'S TRAMP.,brother. He had been sick and the window was open so he could breathe
4355,KITTY'S TRAMP.,the soft spring air. Suddenly a bird dropped upon the window sill and
4356,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"began to whistle ""Chick-a-dee-dee-dee!"" so blithely and cock his head"
4357,KITTY'S TRAMP.,at Charley.
4358,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4359,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""It's the Tramp!"" said Charley; and sure enough it was! After that he"
4360,KITTY'S TRAMP.,came almost every day. If the window was shut they opened it for him.
4361,KITTY'S TRAMP.,Charley used to hide hemp seed and sugar under the edge of the pillows
4362,KITTY'S TRAMP.,for the Tramp to find. He always found it. Sometimes he would tie
4363,KITTY'S TRAMP.,sugar up in a paper and the Tramp would peck at it until he got it
4364,KITTY'S TRAMP.,out.
4365,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4366,KITTY'S TRAMP.,[Illustration: THE TRAMP'S HOME.]
4367,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4368,KITTY'S TRAMP.,He would perch on Charley's shoulder and eat seeds from his mouth.
4369,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4370,KITTY'S TRAMP.,He wanted to build a nest in an old letter box nailed up against a
4371,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"wall. Ever so many birds, blue birds, wrens and sparrows wanted to"
4372,KITTY'S TRAMP.,build in that box too.
4373,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4374,KITTY'S TRAMP.,The Tramp was a brave little fellow and a good fighter; but he never
4375,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"would have driven the birds off, if Kitty hadn't helped him."
4376,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4377,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"""I love all the birds,"" said Kitty, ""but the Tramp is my very own"
4378,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"bird."""
4379,KITTY'S TRAMP.,
4380,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"So he and his mate built a nest and raised a family of birds in peace,"
4381,KITTY'S TRAMP.,"and now Kitty and Charley call the old letter-box ""The Tramp's Home."""

4435,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,They have their nests in a hollow on the ground. The Hottentot likes
4436,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,ostrich eggs to eat. One ostrich egg is as big as sixteen hen's eggs.
4437,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,So it makes a breakfast for a number of people. The Hottentot breaks a
4438,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,"hole in the small end of the egg, stirs up the contents with a stick,"

4441,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,
4442,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,"There is somebody else who likes ostrich eggs too, and that somebody"

4444,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,Sometimes the ostrich comes home and finds him at it.
4445,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,
4446,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,Many other people like to wear ostrich plumes as well as Matty. So
4447,AN OSTRICH PLUME.,there is a large trade in them. The wild ostrich does not supply

4652,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4653,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"When Bobby Smart was six years old, he was left to the care of his"
4654,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"Uncle James, who lived in the country. His aunt took him to his future"
4655,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"home, and at the depot he saw his uncle for the first time."
4656,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4657,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Bobby was lonely and sad; his uncle often treated him with harshness
4658,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,and even cruelty. The cold winter had come on early. Bobby was the
4659,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"only boy about the farm, and he had to work very hard. His clothing"
4660,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"was unfit for the winter weather, and he often suffered from the cold."
4661,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4662,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Among the duties which this poor boy had to perform was that of
4663,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"tending a flock of sheep. One afternoon, when there were signs of a"
4664,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"snow-storm, he was sent to drive the flock to the barn. He started for"
4665,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"the field, but his clothes were so thin that he was benumbed by the"
4666,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,intense cold. He sat down on a large rock to rest himself. He felt
4667,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,strangely tired and cold. In a little while he began to feel drowsy.
4668,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Then he thought it was so nice and comfortable that he would stay
4669,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"there awhile. In a very few moments he was asleep, and perhaps"
4670,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,dreaming.
4671,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4672,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Suddenly he was aroused by a tremendous blow which sent him spinning
4673,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"from his perch on the rock to the ground. Looking about him, he saw an"
4674,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,old ram near by. The creature looked as though he had been doing
4675,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"mischief, and Bobby was no longer at a loss to know where the blow"
4676,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"came from; but he thought the attack was an accident, and in a short"
4677,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,time he was again in the land of Nod.
4678,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4679,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Again the ram very rudely tumbled him over into the snow. He was now
4680,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"wide awake, and provoked at the attack of the beast. He began to"
4681,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,search for a stick to chastise his enemy. The ram understood his
4682,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"intention, for he turned upon Bobby as if to finish the poor boy."
4683,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"Bobby was forced to take to his heels, and ran towards home."
4684,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4685,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"The ram chased him, while the rest of the flock followed after their"
4686,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,leader. The inmates of the farm-house were surprised to see Bobby
4687,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,rushing towards the house as fast as his little legs would allow him.
4688,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"His hair was streaming in the wind, and he was very much terrified."
4689,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"Close upon him was the old ram, kicking up his heels in his anger."
4690,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Behind him could be seen a straggling line of sheep doing their best
4691,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,to keep up.

4695,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"Bobby won the race, however. His uncle came out in time to turn the"
4696,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,flock into the barn. It was a long time before Bobby would venture
4697,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,near the ram again.
4698,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4699,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,Bobby knows now that but for the efforts of that old ram in knocking
4700,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,him from his seat on that bitterly cold day he would have been among
4701,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,the angels in a very short time. The sleepy feeling which overcame him
4702,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,would have ended in death.
4703,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,
4704,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"Bobby declares that the ram knew all the time what ailed him, and that"
4705,SAVED FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.,"he butted him from the rock on purpose. I cannot explain it, but do"

5308,GROUND.],
5309,GROUND.],"Carrie jumped, and lifting Gretchen from it, secured the skirt, and"
5310,GROUND.],Lucindy grasped it and rolled it in a small ball and hid it in the

5312,GROUND.],"was best for Lucindy to go back immediately; but, as it was now"
5313,GROUND.],"impossible to restore the skirt to its place in the wardrobe, they"
5314,GROUND.],"urged her to put it in some unfrequented spot, until a favorable"

5316,GROUND.],"arrive without warning, and, although loth to part without the long"

5610,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5611,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5612,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,Did you ever think of how lowly was the start in life of many of our
5613,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,great men? Read the pages of history and you will find that fully
5614,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,seven out of ten of the great men were really poor. Bonaparte used to
5615,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"be a book agent, Gould was a surveyor, Franklin was a printer,"
5616,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"Garfield worked on the tow path, Lincoln was a rail splitter, Grant"
5617,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"was a tanner, Poe was always in financial distress; Crome, the great"
5618,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"artist, used to pull hair from his cat's tail to make his brushes;"
5619,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,Astor came to New York with nothing as the foundation of his fortunes.
5620,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,The list is almost endless.
5621,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5622,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"To us, there is much encouragement in these facts. By looking into the"
5623,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,lives of such men we find the secret of success. Lincoln was a poor
5624,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"Illinois farmer, with no visionary dreams of his great future. He was"
5625,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,poor and unlearned. Of the poverty he was not ashamed; of his lack of
5626,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,learning he was by no means satisfied. He resolved to gain knowledge.
5627,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"He studied, studied hard, and at a time in his life when other men"
5628,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"felt they had passed the age of schooling. Of his work, we find he"
5629,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,always tried to give an honest day's labor; his motto was to do well
5630,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,everything he put his hands to. It was this trait of character that
5631,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"attracted the attention of his neighbors, and this it was that first"
5632,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,started him on the road to great success.
5633,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5634,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"[Illustration: GRANT'S HOUSE, NEAR ST. LOUIS.]"
5635,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5636,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,Look at the early days of Grant. There was no indication of unusual
5637,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"brightness in him. At West Point, where he was sent to military"
5638,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"school, he did not stand at the head of his classes. He only seemed an"
5639,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"earnest worker, with plenty of determination. Later, when he lived on"
5640,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"his little Illinois farm, there was nothing about him that pointed him"
5641,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,out as the future great general. It was only when the great civil war
5642,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,broke out that he had an opportunity to show the kind of a man he was.
5643,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"His only thought was to accomplish the task assigned him, be it ever"
5644,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"so difficult. This naturally found him in the line of promotion, and"
5645,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"step by step he climbed higher, earning by hard work every step he"
5646,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"gained, until he reached the highest office in the land."
5647,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5648,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"Take Edison, the inventor. He was only a tramp telegrapher, but he was"
5649,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"not satisfied with being anything but the best, and many are the"
5650,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,stories of speed he attained in sending or receiving messages. He was
5651,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,inquisitive--wanted to know more of the mysteries of the electricity
5652,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"that carried his messages. He began experimenting, and by close"
5653,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"application to his studies, has astonished the world with his"
5654,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"telephone, phonograph and other inventions."
5655,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5656,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"Now, these great men are not merely the products of chance. Not at"
5657,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"all. Study each of them and you will find they were workers, gaining"
5658,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,by just such struggles as you and I can make. We may not reach such
5659,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"distinction as these have reached, but rest assured there is just as"
5660,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"great a demand now as ever for good, earnest men, and earnest,"
5661,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"successful men grow from painstaking boys. The boy who, as clerk in"
5662,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"the counting-house, watches after the interests of his employers, will"
5663,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,be the coming merchant; the young man on the farm who slights not the
5664,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"work assigned him, will own a farm of his own."
5665,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,
5666,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"Let this lesson make an impression. The road to success may be rugged,"
5667,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"but it is not so steep but that enough steps, if in the right"
5668,SMALL BEGINNINGS.,"direction, be they ever so short, will in time carry you a long way"

5681,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,"flowing, has washed out the soil, and owing to the peculiar"
5682,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,"composition of the ground has washed it away unevenly, and these"
5683,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,"standing peaks are so numerous and so fantastic in form, that this"
5684,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,location has been called the Garden of the Gods. It is most impressive
5685,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,and inspiring grandeur. A trip will well repay a journey from the most
5686,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,"remote parts of our country to see this view, only a little of which"
5687,GARDEN OF THE GODS.,is in the engraving.

5697,YOUNG ARTIST.,"Albert, the blacksmith's son, will be an artist some day. While other"
5698,YOUNG ARTIST.,"boys are playing ball or skating, or other amusements, Albert is using"
5699,YOUNG ARTIST.,"his time making pictures. He seems to delight in it, and even when"
5700,YOUNG ARTIST.,"quite a small boy, many were the scoldings he received from his"
5701,YOUNG ARTIST.,"parents for a too free use of his chalk and pencil, leaving his rude"
5702,YOUNG ARTIST.,drawings on wall and fences; and in school his troubles were only
5703,YOUNG ARTIST.,"increased, for his books always contained pictures, sometimes of"
5704,YOUNG ARTIST.,"horses, or dogs, or of his friends. This habit did not correspond with"
5705,YOUNG ARTIST.,"his teachers' ideas of tidiness, and punishment followed punishment."
5706,YOUNG ARTIST.,"It did not help matters, though, and his drawing continued. In time he"
5707,YOUNG ARTIST.,became quite apt and could make pictures that very closely resembled
5708,YOUNG ARTIST.,"the objects he drew. His companions called him the ""artist,"" and they"
5709,YOUNG ARTIST.,would have him make pictures of them. Some of his methods were odd
5710,YOUNG ARTIST.,enough. To make an outline of a boy's face he would tack a piece of
5711,YOUNG ARTIST.,"paper on the side of a door in his father's shop, and by placing the"
5712,YOUNG ARTIST.,"boy between the paper and a lighted lamp, would trace with pencil the"
5713,YOUNG ARTIST.,outline of the shadow as it fell on the paper. Soon he tried painting
5714,YOUNG ARTIST.,"with paint and brush. At first his efforts were crude, and to anyone"
5715,YOUNG ARTIST.,"less determined and enthusiastic, discouraging. Not so to Albert. He"
5716,YOUNG ARTIST.,"worked along day after day, and in time could paint well enough to"
5717,YOUNG ARTIST.,attract some notice in his little village.
5718,YOUNG ARTIST.,
5719,YOUNG ARTIST.,"About this time a great artist from the city, spending the summer in"
5720,YOUNG ARTIST.,"this part of the country, heard of Albert, and by accident met him."
5721,YOUNG ARTIST.,"Quick to perceive the natural talent of the boy, and being generously"
5722,YOUNG ARTIST.,"inclined, he offered to take him to his city home and give him"
5723,YOUNG ARTIST.,"training in his studio. The parents, though loth to be separated from"
5724,YOUNG ARTIST.,"their son, saw here an opportunity to educate him in his favorite"
5725,YOUNG ARTIST.,"study, and so accepted the offer."
5726,YOUNG ARTIST.,
5727,YOUNG ARTIST.,You can well imagine Albert's surprise and delight when he first
5728,YOUNG ARTIST.,entered the studio and saw the work of the master. How the great
5729,YOUNG ARTIST.,"paintings filled him with wonder. He proved an apt student, a true"
5730,YOUNG ARTIST.,"artist, and year after year worked with patience and determination,"
5731,YOUNG ARTIST.,and became a noted painter.
5732,YOUNG ARTIST.,
5733,YOUNG ARTIST.,He often thinks of his early days--of the pictures he made in the old
5734,YOUNG ARTIST.,"blacksmith shop. He thinks, too, of the years spent since then in"
5735,YOUNG ARTIST.,"attaining prominence in his calling, but no regrets come to him."
5736,YOUNG ARTIST.,
5737,YOUNG ARTIST.,The true story of how one boy succeeded can be of use to others. It
5738,YOUNG ARTIST.,only takes this same perseverance and pluck to succeed in any other
5739,YOUNG ARTIST.,"calling. Had he complained because he could not paint like the master,"
5740,YOUNG ARTIST.,"and not been contented to study on during these years, he could not"
5741,YOUNG ARTIST.,now lay claim to his present success and eminence as an artist. Let
5742,YOUNG ARTIST.,"others, in reading this, see in it an object, and may it bring to them"
5743,YOUNG ARTIST.,new resolve to succeed in the life work they have started on.
5744,YOUNG ARTIST.,
5745,YOUNG ARTIST.,"Life is what we make it, and not a matter of chance. By marking out a"
5746,YOUNG ARTIST.,"future success we expect to accomplish,--by sticking closely to this"
5747,YOUNG ARTIST.,"one idea, and bending every energy to attain it, we can come"
5748,YOUNG ARTIST.,approximately near accomplishing our undertaking.

6055,IN THE WOODS.,Merryvale was not a very lively place for any one except a couple of
6056,IN THE WOODS.,"young colts, and as many calves, jumping around after their mothers."
6057,IN THE WOODS.,
6058,IN THE WOODS.,"The bees seemed to be making a good deal of fun for themselves, if"
6059,IN THE WOODS.,"stinging us children amused them, and buzzing into every pretty,"
6060,IN THE WOODS.,"bright flower, so that no one could pick it with safety."
6061,IN THE WOODS.,
6062,IN THE WOODS.,"The crows, too, collected in great gossiping parties, in the pines,"
6063,IN THE WOODS.,"over on the shore of the pond, and they always seemed to be"
6064,IN THE WOODS.,congratulating themselves over something immensely satisfactory.
6065,IN THE WOODS.,
6066,IN THE WOODS.,"But we children, especially the girls, found it very dull after we had"
6067,IN THE WOODS.,seen the few sights of the farm. The boys were trying to hunt and
6068,IN THE WOODS.,"fish; but Lib and I talked that over, and we came to the conclusion,"
6069,IN THE WOODS.,"after much laughing and many caustic remarks, that the only amusement"
6070,IN THE WOODS.,"we had was, laughing at their failures."
6071,IN THE WOODS.,
6072,IN THE WOODS.,"We communicated that fact to them, but it didn't seem to make any"
6073,IN THE WOODS.,"difference; off they went on the same fruitless hunt, and left us to"
6074,IN THE WOODS.,"do what we might, to make ourselves happy."
6075,IN THE WOODS.,
6076,IN THE WOODS.,"The next day, Lib and Dora and I told them we would go into the woods"
6077,IN THE WOODS.,"with them and see what the charm was. Lib was the eldest of us three,"
6078,IN THE WOODS.,"and had read a great deal, and she said:"
6079,IN THE WOODS.,
6080,IN THE WOODS.,"""May be we shall find the robbers' cave, and if we say, 'Open Sesame,'"
6081,IN THE WOODS.,"the great stone doors will slowly swing open, and we can go in where"
6082,IN THE WOODS.,"the chains of flashing gems and the heaps of golden coin are."""
6083,IN THE WOODS.,
6084,IN THE WOODS.,"""I think you'll get into places where you can't get out; 'open sesame'"
6085,IN THE WOODS.,"will never lift you out of a marsh hole,"" said William Pitt Gaylord,"
6086,IN THE WOODS.,our eldest brother.
6087,IN THE WOODS.,
6088,IN THE WOODS.,"""Mollie, you can find somebody to have a talking match with, for there"
6089,IN THE WOODS.,"are lots of chipmunks over in the grove,"" remarked Hugh."
6090,IN THE WOODS.,
6091,IN THE WOODS.,"""I've seen snakes in that very woods, too, and if you'd holler, Lib,"
6092,IN THE WOODS.,"at that end of the pond, as you do at this end of the tea-table, you"
6093,IN THE WOODS.,"wouldn't catch any fish,"" said William. This caused an uproarious"
6094,IN THE WOODS.,laugh on the part of the boys.
6095,IN THE WOODS.,
6096,IN THE WOODS.,"We listened quietly to their sarcastic remarks, knowing they were"
6097,IN THE WOODS.,prompted by an unreasonable desire to monopolize the delights of the
6098,IN THE WOODS.,woods to themselves.
6099,IN THE WOODS.,
6100,IN THE WOODS.,"William Pitt remarked that ""Girls had no business to meddle with boys'"
6101,IN THE WOODS.,"sports, and they'd come to grief if they did; you'd see!"""
6102,IN THE WOODS.,
6103,IN THE WOODS.,"Next morning the August haze lay soft on the landscape, but in a"
6104,IN THE WOODS.,"short time it went off, and Father, learning that we girls were going"
6105,IN THE WOODS.,"to spend a part of the day in the woods, quietly told the boys that"
6106,IN THE WOODS.,"they must escort us to the pleasantest place, and not wander very far"
6107,IN THE WOODS.,"off. They pouted considerably, and had a talk at the corner of the"
6108,IN THE WOODS.,"barn; they then came back, smiling, and apparently good-natured."
6109,IN THE WOODS.,
6110,IN THE WOODS.,[Illustration: {WALKING THROUGH THE FIELDS.}]
6111,IN THE WOODS.,
6112,IN THE WOODS.,"Our brothers did not intend to be unkind, but they had the common"
6113,IN THE WOODS.,failing of humanity--selfishness. But Lib matched them in a dozen ways
6114,IN THE WOODS.,with her good-humored retaliations; and many a tilt she had with
6115,IN THE WOODS.,William Pitt since we had arrived at the farm. In the city she was
6116,IN THE WOODS.,abreast of him in all his studies; and I noticed that Lib could get
6117,IN THE WOODS.,"out her Latin, and write a composition much faster than he, and often"
6118,IN THE WOODS.,he had been obliged to come to her for aid. It nettled Lib not to be
6119,IN THE WOODS.,able to hunt and fish. We two younger ones modeled after her; she was
6120,IN THE WOODS.,"the leader, and when she said we would go with the boys, we went."
6121,IN THE WOODS.,
6122,IN THE WOODS.,"""Hello Fred,"" said Hugh, as a neighboring boy, a city boarder, came"
6123,IN THE WOODS.,"through the gate, attired in base-ball cap and knickerbockers, ""we"
6124,IN THE WOODS.,can't go to Duck Inlet to-day. Father says the girls must have a good
6125,IN THE WOODS.,"time, too, and that we must devote one day to them, at least."""
6126,IN THE WOODS.,
6127,IN THE WOODS.,"""All right,"" said Fred, ""can I go with you? I'll go and get my"
6128,IN THE WOODS.,"butterfly net, and we can go over to Fern Hollow mill, the"
6129,IN THE WOODS.,winter-greens and berries are as thick there! Gracious! you can get a
6130,IN THE WOODS.,"quart pail full in no time. The mill-wheel is a beautiful sight,"" said"
6131,IN THE WOODS.,"Fred, turning to Lib, ""and you can sketch it, Miss Gaylord."""
6132,IN THE WOODS.,
6133,IN THE WOODS.,"Lib looked upon Fred with a little more toleration, after he had said"
6134,IN THE WOODS.,"""Miss Gaylord,"" and went and ordered an additional ration to be put"
6135,IN THE WOODS.,"into the lunch basket. We were glad to have Fred along with us, for he"
6136,IN THE WOODS.,"was very funny, and made jokes on every thing."
6137,IN THE WOODS.,
6138,IN THE WOODS.,"Lib would allow no one to carry the lunch basket but herself, as she"
6139,IN THE WOODS.,"remarked, ""It is safer with me."""
6140,IN THE WOODS.,
6141,IN THE WOODS.,"We started, and were tempted to loiter at all the little nooks on the"
6142,IN THE WOODS.,"leaf-shadowed road, and investigate the haunts of the curious dwellers"
6143,IN THE WOODS.,"in the rocks and bushes, and especially were we interested in the"
6144,IN THE WOODS.,ducks on Fern Hollow creek. Dora insisted upon feeding them a piece of
6145,IN THE WOODS.,"bread. ""Calamity,"" the dog, was along, of course, and as he belonged"
6146,IN THE WOODS.,"to William Pitt, who called him ""Clam,"" he was always in that boy's"
6147,IN THE WOODS.,"company. It was, ""Love me, love my dog,"" with William; and as he was a"
6148,IN THE WOODS.,"professional of some kind, he was greatly prized by the boys."
6149,IN THE WOODS.,
6150,IN THE WOODS.,We reached the woods and the old mill early; I think I never was in a
6151,IN THE WOODS.,more delightful place. Every thing seemed to grow here.
6152,IN THE WOODS.,"Winter-greens, with their crimson berries, shining in the moss, and"
6153,IN THE WOODS.,"blueberries, where the sun came; tall, white flowers that grew in"
6154,IN THE WOODS.,"clusters in the shade, sent their perfume all about. Back of the mill,"
6155,IN THE WOODS.,"on some sandy ledges, grew pennyroyal and spearmint; raspberries and"
6156,IN THE WOODS.,blackberries grew everywhere.
6157,IN THE WOODS.,
6158,IN THE WOODS.,[Illustration: {A STREAM RUNNING THROUGH FIELDS.}]
6159,IN THE WOODS.,
6160,IN THE WOODS.,"The boys went off to gather a quantity for lunch, and Lib and Dora and"
6161,IN THE WOODS.,I hunted for a pleasant place to set out our dainties. We found it. A
6162,IN THE WOODS.,"natural bower, between four trees; one being a giant of a pine, right"
6163,IN THE WOODS.,at the doorway. The wild grape-vine and the woodbine had inclosed the
6164,IN THE WOODS.,"space so completely, that Lib, who had thoughtfully brought along a"
6165,IN THE WOODS.,"scissors to cut off stubborn plants, could make two windows in the"
6166,IN THE WOODS.,"green wall; one looking into the woods, the other off at the distant"
6167,IN THE WOODS.,"pond. The grass was fine in here, and the sunbeams dropped down in"
6168,IN THE WOODS.,"little round spots, on the pine needles that covered the floor."
6169,IN THE WOODS.,
6170,IN THE WOODS.,"""This is certainly the fairies' dining hall,"" said Lib."
6171,IN THE WOODS.,
6172,IN THE WOODS.,"""I'll tell you what,"" said I, ""this is not far from home, and we can"
6173,IN THE WOODS.,"bring things, and have a little parlor here. I can make a couple of"
6174,IN THE WOODS.,"curtains out of that figured scrim, for windows, and that old square"
6175,IN THE WOODS.,rug in the carriage-house will do for the floor. You can bring your
6176,IN THE WOODS.,"rocking-chair, Lib, and Dora can bring her tea-set."""
6177,IN THE WOODS.,
6178,IN THE WOODS.,"""I'll bring our Christmas and Easter cards, and we can fasten them all"
6179,IN THE WOODS.,"about, on the walls,"" said Lib, who had fallen in immediately with the"
6180,IN THE WOODS.,plan.
6181,IN THE WOODS.,
6182,IN THE WOODS.,"""I'll bring Mrs. Snobley, and all her children, and the dining table,"""
6183,IN THE WOODS.,said Dora.
6184,IN THE WOODS.,
6185,IN THE WOODS.,"She had reference to her large doll, and a whole dozen of little ones,"
6186,IN THE WOODS.,that were always brought forward in any play that Dora had taken a
6187,IN THE WOODS.,fancy to.
6188,IN THE WOODS.,
6189,IN THE WOODS.,"We were in such haste to put our scheme into operation, that we"
6190,IN THE WOODS.,"dispatched the lunch in short order, and told the boys of our plan."
6191,IN THE WOODS.,"They thought it was capital. Any thing that would release them, after"
6192,IN THE WOODS.,"they had eaten all that was to be had, would, of course, be received"
6193,IN THE WOODS.,"with acclamation. They acknowledged the same, in a very neat speech,"
6194,IN THE WOODS.,"which Lib said, ""did very good for Hugh."""
6195,IN THE WOODS.,
6196,IN THE WOODS.,"She fell in immediately with our fun, and helped us to a number of"
6197,IN THE WOODS.,"nice things, to furnish our greenwood bower. We worked tremendously"
6198,IN THE WOODS.,"that afternoon, and after Betty had washed the dinner dishes, she"
6199,IN THE WOODS.,"helped us. Before sun-down every thing was complete. The boys, who had"
6200,IN THE WOODS.,"taken themselves a mile away, to hunt, came round to visit us on their"
6201,IN THE WOODS.,"way home. They agreed that it was just perfect, and inquired if we"
6202,IN THE WOODS.,"hadn't put in an elevator, to reach the second story, with numerous"
6203,IN THE WOODS.,"other inquiries, intended to be funny; and then asked where we kept"
6204,IN THE WOODS.,our cranberry tarts.
6205,IN THE WOODS.,
6206,IN THE WOODS.,"""We're not going to allow any boys in this play-house after to-day,"""
6207,IN THE WOODS.,"said I; ""your feet are muddy, and you're so big, you fill it all up."""
6208,IN THE WOODS.,
6209,IN THE WOODS.,"Our visitor, Fred, looked at his feet, and blushed. ""Not after to-day?"
6210,IN THE WOODS.,"How are you going to keep any one out?"" inquired William Pitt."
6211,IN THE WOODS.,
6212,IN THE WOODS.,"""We will draw this portiere across the doorway, and no _gentleman_"
6213,IN THE WOODS.,"would think of entering,"" said Lib."
6214,IN THE WOODS.,
6215,IN THE WOODS.,"""No, they wouldn't, sure enough,"" said Hugh. ""How are you going to"
6216,IN THE WOODS.,"prevent our looking in the windows?"""
6217,IN THE WOODS.,
6218,IN THE WOODS.,"""Only rude boys would look in windows,"" said Fred, ""and I don't know"
6219,IN THE WOODS.,"of any hereabouts."""
6220,IN THE WOODS.,
6221,IN THE WOODS.,"They laughed at this, and Lib laughed too, and made the sly remark,"
6222,IN THE WOODS.,"that ""Hunting on the duck-pond transformed some people mighty soon."""
6223,IN THE WOODS.,
6224,IN THE WOODS.,Fred said he'd try to be on his good behavior if we'd let him make a
6225,IN THE WOODS.,formal call on us the next afternoon. We consented to this; then they
6226,IN THE WOODS.,all said they'd call.
6227,IN THE WOODS.,
6228,IN THE WOODS.,The next day we busied ourselves in preparing a spread of good things
6229,IN THE WOODS.,"for our reception, and Betty took it over, and on returning, said"
6230,IN THE WOODS.,every thing was just as we had left it. We dressed ourselves up in our
6231,IN THE WOODS.,"best, to receive the gentlemen, a little time after dinner. The woods"
6232,IN THE WOODS.,"were never so lovely, we thought, and to add to our personal charms,"
6233,IN THE WOODS.,we made wreaths and garlands of ferns and wild-flowers to adorn our
6234,IN THE WOODS.,persons and hats.
6235,IN THE WOODS.,
6236,IN THE WOODS.,"I had sauntered along considerably in advance, and as I approached the"
6237,IN THE WOODS.,bower I was not a little surprised to see from a distance that the
6238,IN THE WOODS.,"door-curtain was drawn half open. I stopped to listen, but there was"
6239,IN THE WOODS.,"no sound, only a wild bird piping its three little notes, down by the"
6240,IN THE WOODS.,"mill. I cautiously went up, and peeped into the little window, and"
6241,IN THE WOODS.,there stood a man on the rug! He seemed to be looking about. I think I
6242,IN THE WOODS.,"never was so frightened. I ran back, and whispered to the rest the"
6243,IN THE WOODS.,dreadful state of things. They looked horror-stricken. Lib changed
6244,IN THE WOODS.,"color, but just stood still. Then she said,--""There's plenty of help"
6245,IN THE WOODS.,"over at the mill."""
6246,IN THE WOODS.,
6247,IN THE WOODS.,"""Oh, let us go no nearer, but get home as fast as we can,"" I said."
6248,IN THE WOODS.,
6249,IN THE WOODS.,"Lib raised her hand in warning for us to keep still, and we crept"
6250,IN THE WOODS.,"along, softly, behind the bower; and when we had gotten so far, we all"
6251,IN THE WOODS.,turned around and ran for dear life into the woods again.
6252,IN THE WOODS.,
6253,IN THE WOODS.,"""This is nonsense,"" said Lib. ""You were mistaken, Mollie, I'm sure."""
6254,IN THE WOODS.,
6255,IN THE WOODS.,"I said I'd go back with her, and she could see for herself. We crept"
6256,IN THE WOODS.,"to the back of the bower, and Lib leaned over and looked in. Lib"
6257,IN THE WOODS.,"turned pale, caught hold of my hand and Dora's, and ran quite a"
6258,IN THE WOODS.,"distance toward the mill. Then she stopped, and said, as true as she"
6259,IN THE WOODS.,"was alive, there was a man in there; he stood with a large stick"
6260,IN THE WOODS.,"resting on his shoulder, upon which was slung a bundle, tied up in a"
6261,IN THE WOODS.,"red handkerchief, his clothing was ragged, and his hat was very"
6262,IN THE WOODS.,dilapidated.
6263,IN THE WOODS.,
6264,IN THE WOODS.,"""Oh, Lib, I'm going to run for it,"" said I."
6265,IN THE WOODS.,
6266,IN THE WOODS.,"""Wait a minute,"" said she. ""I don't hear any noise. Let's think; if we"
6267,IN THE WOODS.,"didn't have to go right in front of the door, we could get to the"
6268,IN THE WOODS.,"mill."""
6269,IN THE WOODS.,
6270,IN THE WOODS.,All this time we were edging ourselves as far away from the dangerous
6271,IN THE WOODS.,"precincts as we conveniently could. She stood again, perfectly still."
6272,IN THE WOODS.,"""I won't go another step,"" she said. That moment's reflect had"
6273,IN THE WOODS.,"re-instated her courage. ""He don't come out; I should say that was"
6274,IN THE WOODS.,making an informal call when the ladies were out. He's a
6275,IN THE WOODS.,"beautiful-looking specimen anyway,"" said Lib, with fine irony; and as"
6276,IN THE WOODS.,"she said this, she frowned, and put her head back."
6277,IN THE WOODS.,
6278,IN THE WOODS.,"No sound was heard, and no demonstrations from the interloper were"
6279,IN THE WOODS.,"made. The sight of the mill-wagon, going slowly down the road, gave us"
6280,IN THE WOODS.,"heart, and Lib said:"
6281,IN THE WOODS.,
6282,IN THE WOODS.,"""I'll go and order him out, be the consequences what they may."
6283,IN THE WOODS.,"Mollie, you're good at screaming, you can bring the miller here if we"
6284,IN THE WOODS.,"have to get help."""
6285,IN THE WOODS.,
6286,IN THE WOODS.,"""Don't! Don't! I would rather he stole all our things; let him have"
6287,IN THE WOODS.,"the tarts and the cocoanut cake, and the jam, and the pickles, and the"
6288,IN THE WOODS.,"cheese, and the sandwiches! Let him have them in welcome! I'm going to"
6289,IN THE WOODS.,"fly home!"""
6290,IN THE WOODS.,
6291,IN THE WOODS.,"""I want Mrs. Snobley!"" sobbed Dora."
6292,IN THE WOODS.,
6293,IN THE WOODS.,"Lib never said another word. She walked up to the entrance, and pulled"
6294,IN THE WOODS.,"aside the curtain, and there stood the semblance of a man. In his"
6295,IN THE WOODS.,"extended hand was a card, on which was very badly printed:"
6296,IN THE WOODS.,
6297,IN THE WOODS.,"""_I'm a poor b'y,--I want a home._"""
6298,IN THE WOODS.,
6299,IN THE WOODS.,"""_References exchanged._"""
6300,IN THE WOODS.,
6301,IN THE WOODS.,"""_I'll scrape the mud off me boots, if ye'll let me"
6302,IN THE WOODS.,"in._"""
6303,IN THE WOODS.,
6304,IN THE WOODS.,"Lib called, ""Come here, Mollie, it's a trick of those boys."""
6305,IN THE WOODS.,
6306,IN THE WOODS.,"We went in, and there we found the interloper to be a scarecrow from a"
6307,IN THE WOODS.,"neighboring field, ingeniously arranged so as to appear very human."
6308,IN THE WOODS.,
6309,IN THE WOODS.,"At that moment, a loud laugh above our heads betrayed the presence of"
6310,IN THE WOODS.,"the boys in the trees, who clambered down with hilarious expedition,"
6311,IN THE WOODS.,and fairly rolled themselves upon the ground with delight. They had
6312,IN THE WOODS.,seen all our perturbation; had heard my cowardly cries and
6313,IN THE WOODS.,"expressions; Lib's looking in the window, and her fearful hesitation"
6314,IN THE WOODS.,"and scamper behind the fairy bower! The best thing to do was to laugh,"
6315,IN THE WOODS.,"and that we did right heartily; we girls, were internally thankful"
6316,IN THE WOODS.,that the intruder was only a scarecrow after all.
6317,IN THE WOODS.,
6318,IN THE WOODS.,"We ordered the boys take their silly joke out, and to come in like"
6319,IN THE WOODS.,"gentlemen, and make a formal call, and probably they would be invited"
6320,IN THE WOODS.,to take some refreshments.
6321,IN THE WOODS.,
6322,IN THE WOODS.,This news caused them to work with great alacrity. They were dressed
6323,IN THE WOODS.,"up too; Fred having chosen to wear his school uniform, with a gorgeous"
6324,IN THE WOODS.,crimson sash and his sword.
6325,IN THE WOODS.,
6326,IN THE WOODS.,We were never so delighted with any thing as with that afternoon's

6345,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Oh, Bessie! I've such an idea, _such_ a good one, and _so_ sure, you"
6346,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"can't think how it came either, if you guessed and tried for a week!"""
6347,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6348,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Child, you are always having ideas, but they amount to nothing; you"
6349,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"have enough to do at home, without continually fretting your head"
6350,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"about what you cannot carry out."""
6351,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6352,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""But, Bessie, this is _just splendid_, and it came to me all of a"
6353,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"sudden, and I'm sure as sure can be that it is a real _good_ idea. Now"
6354,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"wont you listen!"""
6355,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6356,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""I suppose I must, if I want any peace; but I'm very tired, so if it"
6357,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"is like your latest--to catch fish and sell them in the town, or to"
6358,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,have your curls cut off and let some city hair-dresser pay you for
6359,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"them--there will be no use to tell it to me."""
6360,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6361,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Tain't neither, Bessie dear, it's a real clever idea, and I know you"
6362,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,wont say 'no' to it. I was looking over some of the old picture papers
6363,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"this morning, and I found a funny picture of a gentleman that had gone"
6364,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"fishing with, oh! the greatest lot of lines, and a fine rod, and a"
6365,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"basket swung at his back, and he looked ever so nice; but he hadn't"
6366,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,caught any thing and he was ashamed to go back to the city with an
6367,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,empty basket; and then there was another picture where he was buying a
6368,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"great string of fish from a bare-footed little country boy, that had"
6369,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"caught them all, and had only a rough old pole and an old line on it."""
6370,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6371,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""So it _is_ the fishing idea, again,"" said Bessie, ""but the present"
6372,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"variation does not improve on the last."""
6373,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6374,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""No, it just ain't the fishing idea any more; it's this: you know all"
6375,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the excursion parties that come up here, are coming all the time now;"
6376,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"well, the ladies all gather autumn leaves, lots and lots, handsful and"
6377,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,handsful of them. But they get tired of carrying so many after a
6378,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"while, and by the time they get ready to go back to the cars, their"
6379,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"leaves are thrown away, and they are empty-handed. Now just listen! If"
6380,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,I go to work and pick out the _very_ prettiest leaves and do them up
6381,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"in the _very_ sweetest bunches, and tie them so they are easy to"
6382,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"carry, and meet them when they are starting to go home, I'm _sure_"
6383,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"they will buy them, just like the gentleman did the fish from that"
6384,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"boy. Now, ain't that a _real good_ idea?"""
6385,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6386,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""I believe there is something in it, Katie,"" answered the eldest"
6387,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,sister.
6388,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6389,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""I knew you would,"" cried Katie, joyously, ""and may I try it?"""
6390,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6391,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""If you will be very careful and not talk too much to the people you"
6392,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"know nothing of, I have no objections; it can do no harm, at all"
6393,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"events,"" and poor, tired Bessie sighed as she looked at her bright"
6394,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,young sister and thought of the time when she too was young and full
6395,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,of hope and gay spirits.
6396,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6397,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,There was quite a family of these Wilsons in the little house at the
6398,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"foot of the mountains, in Pennsylvania. The widowed mother, sickly and"
6399,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"almost blind; Bessie, a young lady, the eldest daughter, aged"
6400,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"twenty-three, who taught a very large school for very small pay; then"
6401,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Katie not quite twelve, and Robbie, the baby, the pet, the boy, who"
6402,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,was only five.
6403,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6404,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Three years before, their father had been living, and they had enjoyed"
6405,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"all that wealth could bring them. Suddenly he sickened and died, and"
6406,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,then came the dreadful knowledge that he left nothing for his family;
6407,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"he was deeply in debt to his partner, with whom he had worked a large"
6408,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"coal-mine, and this Mr. Moore was what all people called a ""hard man,"""
6409,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"he was old and crabbed, and always wanted and would have every cent"
6410,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"coming to him. Bessie was to have been married to his son, Philip, but"
6411,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"when poverty came to her, the old man refused to let Philip see her"
6412,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"more, and the girl was too proud to go into a family where she was"
6413,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"not wanted, and, beside, she had her poor mother, who had given up"
6414,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"and failed fast after her misfortunes, she had her to look after. So"
6415,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,Bessie taught school; Katie attended to the little home into which
6416,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"they had moved from the great house on the hill, a noble little"
6417,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,housekeeper she was; Robbie did about as he pleased and was well
6418,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"content with life, except when neat Katie would seize him and wash his"
6419,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"face with plenty of soap in his eyes, and comb his tangled curls with"
6420,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"a comb that ""allus pulled,"" as he cried."
6421,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6422,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"It was hard for them to pay the rent, to get food and the many"
6423,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"delicacies Mrs. Wilson had always been used to, and now needed more"
6424,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"than ever. Bessie's small wages from her school were taken, every"
6425,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"cent, for these, and Katie was continually bothering her young head"
6426,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"with ""ideas"" as to how _she_ could make money to help them all. The"
6427,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"autumn leaves were the latest, and it really did seem as though there"
6428,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,were something in it.
6429,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6430,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"The next day was Saturday, Bessie was free from school duties, and so"
6431,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,her little sister had more time at her disposal. Friday evening she
6432,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,and Robbie gathered a great quantity of bright-colored leaves; the
6433,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"next morning, bright and early, they were out again; the little back"
6434,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,porch was filled with them.
6435,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6436,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"With her own natural good taste, aided by Bessie's more cultivated"
6437,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"judgment, they made up many neat, beautiful bunches of those"
6438,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,bright-colored droppings from the forest trees. These she placed in a
6439,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"large but pretty basket that once had been sent, filled with rare"
6440,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"fruit, to Bessie, from Philip, and the older girl sighed when she gave"
6441,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,it to her sister.
6442,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6443,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Then Katie started, leaving Robbie behind crying; and with a trembling"
6444,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"heart and a big lump in her throat, but bravely as a little soldier,"
6445,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,she made her way to the path by which the excursion parties would have
6446,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"to return to the cars. Soon they began to come along, all tired,"
6447,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,trying to be merry ladies and gentlemen.
6448,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6449,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,Katie stood with her basket on her arm. She did not know how pretty
6450,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"she looked, with her brown curls floating out from beneath her big"
6451,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"sun-bonnet, her pure white apron, her dark dress which Bessie had made"
6452,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"from one of her own, with delicate bits of lace at the wrists, a"
6453,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,bright bit of ribbon about her throat and a plain little breast-pin
6454,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"clasping it. Her big black eyes looked longingly at the passers-by,"
6455,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"her red lips tried, many times, to utter some words that would help"
6456,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"her sell her wares, but she could not speak, she could only up her"
6457,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,hand and _look_ her wants.
6458,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6459,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""What lovely leaves!"" cried a young lady, ""these of mine seem all"
6460,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"faded by the carrying, and I'm tired of the great load anyhow,"" and"
6461,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"she threw away a great lot tied round with her handkerchief, and"
6462,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,hastened toward the little merchant.
6463,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6464,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""What a pretty girl,"" said the young man with her."
6465,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6466,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""How much are these?"" inquired the lady."
6467,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6468,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Bessie had not thought of what she would ask for her bunches, and now,"
6469,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"between pleasure and fright, she could not think of any price to put"
6470,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,upon them.
6471,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6472,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Whatever you please, Miss,"" she faintly murmured."
6473,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6474,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""How lovely they are,"" said the lady, and taking three bunches, she"
6475,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"gave two to the young man with her, telling him: ""Harry, you must"
6476,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"carry these, and pay the child,"" the third one she kept in her own"
6477,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,hand.
6478,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6479,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"The gentleman put his hand in his pocket, drew it out, and dropped"
6480,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,into Katie's basket a silver dollar.
6481,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6482,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,The tears almost blinded the little girl--tears of joy over her first
6483,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"success--she could hardly see what the coin was, but when she picked"
6484,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"it up she managed to stammer that she ""had no change."""
6485,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6486,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Don't want any, little one,"" said the young man pleasantly, ""the"
6487,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"sight of you is worth all the money and more."" Then the couple hurried"
6488,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,away.
6489,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6490,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"But their stopping had attracted many more, and a dozen bought of"
6491,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Katie, and, though few were as generous as her first customers, she"
6492,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"soon disposed of most of her stock at ten cents a bunch, having gained"
6493,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,courage to fix and state her price. Quite a number gave her more than
6494,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"that sum, and she began to feel a very rich little girl, indeed."
6495,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6496,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"More than half her stock was sold, when an old gentleman and a young"
6497,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"lady came along. The lady, as usual, was the first to admire the"
6498,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"bright bunches, she took two, the old gentleman giving Katie fifty"
6499,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"cents and telling her that ""was right."" He seemed a cross old man, but"
6500,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,still spoke pleasantly.
6501,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6502,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""What's your name, child?"" he asked."
6503,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6504,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Katie Wilson, sir,"" replied the little girl, faintly."
6505,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6506,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Um! um! Come along Helen,"" said he, hastily, and hurried away."
6507,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6508,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"These were the last of the excursion parties, except an elderly lady"
6509,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"having in charge a dozen children, all dressed alike; little ones from"
6510,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"a soldiers' orphan school, for whom some kind person had provided a"
6511,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"day's pleasure. They were tired and worn out with romping, and dragged"
6512,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,along slowly; they looked at Katie's bright face and longingly at the
6513,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,pretty leaves in her basket. The girl's heart was touched; timidly she
6514,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"held out a bunch to a little boy who half stopped in front of her, he"
6515,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,took it eagerly; in a moment the others were about her. By good
6516,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"fortune, she had enough to give on to each and an extra bunch to the"
6517,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,lady.
6518,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6519,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"With the thanks of these poor children in her heart, an empty basket"
6520,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"and a happy jingle in her pocket she ran nearly all the way home,"
6521,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"burst in on Bessie, put her arms about her neck and sobbed for"
6522,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,happiness.
6523,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6524,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"When the elder sister at last succeeded in calming her, she told the"
6525,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,whole story of her afternoon's work.
6526,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6527,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,Together they counted the money--three dollars and eighty-five
6528,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,cents--just think of it!
6529,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6530,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"If ever there was a happy, excited little girl, it was Katie that"
6531,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"night. She could not sleep or eat. When she _had to_ go to bed, she"
6532,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"lay awake long, long hours, thinking how _she_ would buy back the big"
6533,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"house, how mother should have doctors and every thing she needed, how"
6534,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Bessie should stop teaching and have a horse and little carriage, and"
6535,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"pretty dresses, and a piano, like she used to, and how Robbie should"
6536,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,go to school and college and grow up to be a great man and finally be
6537,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"President. She never thought of herself, except that _she_ was to do"
6538,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"all this, and when she fell asleep she dreamed the whole thing over"
6539,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"again, and that it had turned out just as she planned."
6540,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6541,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"All through the excursion season Katie sold her leaves, and though she"
6542,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"never made as much as on the first day, yet when people stopped coming"
6543,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"she had over one hundred dollars in Bessie's hands, all made by"
6544,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"herself, all made by being up early and attending to her household"
6545,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,duties and working hard so as to have her bunches ready by the time
6546,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,that visitors were returning to the train.
6547,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6548,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"She was brave, and true, and unselfish, and her reward was great."
6549,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6550,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"It was one chill November evening, toward Thanksgiving day, that she"
6551,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,and Robbie had wandered out among the mountain paths; the little
6552,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,fellow was wild as a colt and ran here and there until it was all
6553,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,Katie could do to keep track of him. Finally she caught him; both were
6554,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"tired out, and when she looked around, to her great terror, she could"
6555,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,not make out just where they were. They wandered along and at last
6556,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"came to a road, but she did not know which way to go. Robbie was cross"
6557,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"and sleepy; she could not carry the heavy boy, and he _would_ lay"
6558,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,down; at last she let him rest. He dropped by a fallen log and in a
6559,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"moment was asleep. She covered him with a little cloth cape she wore,"
6560,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"and sat down beside him; her eyes were heavy, she nodded, and very"
6561,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,soon was as sound as he.
6562,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6563,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Along the road came a thin, old, but active man; he stepped out firmly"
6564,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,and aided his steps with a stout cane. It was after dusk of the
6565,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"evening. He spied something in the gloom, on the other side of the"
6566,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"road, something unusual; he crossed over; it was a little girl leaning"
6567,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"against a big, fallen tree and a small boy stretched on the ground"
6568,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,beside it; both were fast asleep. He touched the girl's shoulder; she
6569,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"sprang up. ""Oh!"" she gasped, ""don't hurt Robbie! We weren't doing any"
6570,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"harm, indeed we weren't."""
6571,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6572,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""What are you doing here any how?"" he inquired."
6573,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6574,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""It was Robbie, no, it was me, he was so sleepy and so was I, and we"
6575,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"were just resting until we could start and try to find home again."""
6576,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6577,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Um! so you're lost, are you?"""
6578,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6579,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""No, sir, I guess not only--only we don't know the way."""
6580,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6581,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Well, I should say that's pretty near being lost. Where do you live?"
6582,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"What's your name?"""
6583,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6584,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""We live in the old Mill cottage, and my name's Katie Wilson, and"
6585,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Robbie's is Robert T. Wilson."""
6586,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6587,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Um! um! Yes; well, I know where you live; come along, I'll put you"
6588,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"right. Come! wake up here, young man!"" and he gently poked Robbie with"
6589,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"his cane. But Robbie was sleepy and cross, and cried and kicked, and"
6590,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,it was all Katie could do to get him on his feet and moving. Then as
6591,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"they went slowly on, she holding her brother's hand, her own in that"
6592,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"of the stranger, he asked her: ""Weren't you frightened to be out all"
6593,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"alone?"""
6594,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6595,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Why, no, sir,"" she answered. ""I was frightened for mother and Bessie"
6596,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"being worried, but not for us; I just said my prayers and covered"
6597,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Robbie, and then I fell asleep and didn't know any thing until you"
6598,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"woke me up."""
6599,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6600,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Um! said your prayers, did you!"" and the old man stopped and looked"
6601,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,at her.
6602,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6603,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""See here, Katie!"" he said, in a very gentle voice, ""say your prayers"
6604,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"for me, I'd like to hear them."""
6605,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6606,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,The child looked at him in astonishment and trouble. Could it be that
6607,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the gentleman could not say his prayers for himself, that he did not"
6608,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"pray himself! ""Oh, sir!"" she said, with choking voice and tears in her"
6609,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"eyes, ""I can't say them to you, only to Bessie or mother: It's just"
6610,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"God bless mother, and Bessie and Robbie and me, and take care of us in"
6611,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the night and day, and--and that's all, sir."""
6612,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6613,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"""Well, never mind now, little Katie, come along, we must get Robbie"
6614,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"home to the mother and Bessie soon, or they'll think the bears have"
6615,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"eaten you both,"" and the old man's voice was still more gentle, and he"
6616,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"hurried as fast as the little ones could go. He knew the roads well,"
6617,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,and in half an hour they were on a path that the children were well
6618,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"acquainted with, and near home."
6619,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6620,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"There was a cry of joy, and Bessie sprang upon the little ones at a"
6621,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"bend in the road and gathered them in her arms, and kissed and scolded"
6622,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"and petted them, all at the same time."
6623,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,
6624,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,The old gentleman hurried away as soon as he saw they were safe; but
6625,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,he did not go far; he stepped back in the dark and heard Katie tell
6626,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the tale of adventure and take all the blame herself, and excuse"
6627,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"Robbie, and talk about the kind gentleman who had found them and"
6628,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"brought them home, and wonder where he had gone so quickly before she"
6629,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,had time to thank him. He followed them at a distance; he saw them
6630,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"enter their home, and he watched outside until the lamp was lighted in"
6631,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,the little sitting-room; then he came near the window and looked in;
6632,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"he watched while the sick, half-blind mother cried over her children;"
6633,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"he saw pale, sweet-faced Bessie comforting all; he stood there an"
6634,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,hour without noticing the cold and wind that grew about him. He saw
6635,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"brave, hard-working Bessie, and true Katie, and the little boy, and"
6636,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the mother of all, kneel at their chairs, and he thought he could hear"
6637,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,the prayers of thanks that came from the hearts of all and the lips of
6638,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"the older sister, and he felt drops upon his cheek, not rain, but"

6647,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"of ""hard old man"" Moore was little Katie, wondering to see such an old"
6648,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"man wipe the tears from his eyes, wondering at the way in which he"
6649,ALEX DUKE BAILIE.,"held one arm close around her, and wondering still more why he should"

6703,FOSTER PARENTS.,
6704,FOSTER PARENTS.,"Strolling down back of the barn, and seeing a fluttering of wings near"
6705,FOSTER PARENTS.,"the ground, Fred and John discovered, upon coming closer, that a poor"
6706,FOSTER PARENTS.,little bird had fallen from its nest in the bough of a tree that stood
6707,FOSTER PARENTS.,"near them. The bird was young, too young to fly, and seemed more dead"
6708,FOSTER PARENTS.,"than alive from the fall. The boys took the bird, fondly caressed it,"
6709,FOSTER PARENTS.,"stroked its feathers, and were glad to see that it showed signs of"
6710,FOSTER PARENTS.,life and that it was only stunned by the fall it had received. The
6711,FOSTER PARENTS.,"boys were kind-hearted, they were boys full of life, the first-most in"
6712,FOSTER PARENTS.,"a race, in climbing a hill they among the first who stood on its top."
6713,FOSTER PARENTS.,"Yet in all their sports they were never cruel. So with the bird, they"
6714,FOSTER PARENTS.,only thought of how to care for it. The tree was too tall to climb
6715,FOSTER PARENTS.,"with safety, and then they were forbidden to climb this tree because"
6716,FOSTER PARENTS.,John had once ventured to the first of its branches and by some
6717,FOSTER PARENTS.,"accident, such as will happen to boys, he lost his hold and tumbled to"
6718,FOSTER PARENTS.,the ground and he still remembered the days of pain it caused.
6719,FOSTER PARENTS.,
6720,FOSTER PARENTS.,"Said Fred, ""Why can we not take the bird home and care for it?"""
6721,FOSTER PARENTS.,
6722,FOSTER PARENTS.,"So, with this suggestion, they brought it to the house and placed it"
6723,FOSTER PARENTS.,in a small basket. The basket was one they used to carry their dinners
6724,FOSTER PARENTS.,"to school in, and, of course, this could not be used to keep it in all"
6725,FOSTER PARENTS.,"the time. John said, ""It will be best to make a cage for it. We can,"
6726,FOSTER PARENTS.,"with our knives, soon whittle out sticks for bars and with the saw and"
6727,FOSTER PARENTS.,"some boards make a cage."" They labored on this for two days, and then,"
6728,FOSTER PARENTS.,"with Uncle Ben's help, for he could drive nails better than they, the"
6729,FOSTER PARENTS.,cage was completed. Some cotton was shaped into a nest and the bird
6730,FOSTER PARENTS.,was placed in it and the cage was its home.
6731,FOSTER PARENTS.,
6732,FOSTER PARENTS.,They fed it on berries and crumbs and it grew rapidly. It soon learned
6733,FOSTER PARENTS.,to perch on one of the boy's fingers and pick its food from his hand.
6734,FOSTER PARENTS.,When it had eaten enough it would fly to his shoulder and seem quite
6735,FOSTER PARENTS.,"contented. In due time it became full grown, and though it seemed to"
6736,FOSTER PARENTS.,"know and appreciate the attention given it by the boys, yet it seemed"
6737,FOSTER PARENTS.,to long for more freedom than the little cage afforded. The boys
6738,FOSTER PARENTS.,"noticed this, and with sad hearts concluded it would be cruel to keep"
6739,FOSTER PARENTS.,it confined and so gave it its freedom. For some time it lingered
6740,FOSTER PARENTS.,"around the house, in branches of the trees, but finally it flew away"

6990,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
6991,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
6992,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,Several years ago the beautiful Shenandoah valley in West Virginia was
6993,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"the scene of a great freshet. The river overflowed its banks, and the"
6994,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"usually placid stream became a mighty torrent, rushing along with"
6995,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"frightful velocity, carrying away houses, barns and cattle. Buildings"
6996,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"were washed from their foundations by the resistless current, and sent"
6997,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,whirling down the stream with the terrified occupants clinging to the
6998,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"roofs. They had not had timely warning, and many perished, while whole"
6999,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"flocks of sheep, and hundreds of cows, horses and oxen were drowned."
7000,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"The writer visited the valley several years afterward, and could see"
7001,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,articles of clothing and even furniture still lodged in the branches
7002,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"of trees, they had been caught and lodged by the receding waters,"
7003,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,twenty feet from the ground.
7004,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
7005,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,During this visit a most interesting story was told of a poor little
7006,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"kitten who lost home and friends, and was carried by the surging flood"
7007,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,far away to find a new home and a genuine lover. It is a true romance
7008,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"of the flood, and it has never been told in print so far. For all"
7009,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"gentle lovers of animals, this beautiful romance of Woggy and Waif is"
7010,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,given to the world.
7011,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
7012,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"In this beautiful valley there lived a lovely family, consisting of"
7013,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"father, mother and two children. Edwin was a tall and manly lad of"
7014,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"sixteen, and Florence was one year younger. They were children of"
7015,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"refined and cultivated parents, and the members of this little home"
7016,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,circle displayed such charming affection and thoughtfulness in their
7017,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"intercourse with each other, that it was beautiful to behold. Edwin"
7018,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"was passionately fond of out-of-door sports, and Florence had deep"
7019,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,love for all that was beautiful and interesting in nature. She loved
7020,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"animals, birds and flowers, and it was her delight to ramble with her"
7021,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"brother through the woods, gathering the modest wild flowers, or the"
7022,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,delicate maiden hair ferns. She took great delight in pets of all
7023,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"kinds, and had numerous rabbits, birds and squirrels that her brother"
7024,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,had trapped; she made them all love her; even the tiniest bird or
7025,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,animal can appreciate tenderness and kindness; and Florence's pure
7026,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,little heart was overflowing with love and kindness toward all God's
7027,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,dumb creatures.
7028,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
7029,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,The constant companion of the brother and sister in their rambles was
7030,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"a very frolicsome and handsome dog, which was so remarkable for"
7031,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"sagacity and intelligence, that he was known through all the"
7032,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"countryside; he was devoted to his young mistress, and, though he was"
7033,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,not a very large animal; he had enough of the Shepherd's breed in him
7034,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,to make him very fierce and courageous in her defense whenever she
7035,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,seemed to need it.
7036,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
7037,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"At the time of the great freshet, a homeless family, whose house had"
7038,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"been swept away by the flood, had been harbored at Florence's home."
7039,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"Her time and mind was fully occupied by her additional home duties,"
7040,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"which to her gentle nature, were labors of love, even if the"
7041,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,overflowed valley had prevented her accustomed excursions; but not so
7042,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"with Woggy, he had no duties to keep him, and no wet ground or body of"
7043,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,water could keep him from taking his usual runs about the country. For
7044,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"several days after the great flood, he was noticed to leave the house"
7045,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,regularly in the morning and not return until evening. This was
7046,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,something unusual; generally his runs were finished in one or two
7047,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,hours; but when he was observed one day to take in his mouth the best
7048,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"part of his breakfast and trot off with it, Edwin's curiosity was"
7049,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"excited, and he resolved to unravel the mystery of Woggy's regular"
7050,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,absences; he followed his tracks over the wet ground for nearly two
7051,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"miles, until he came to a good sized pond left by the receding waters"
7052,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,in a hollow near the river. The first thing that attracted his
7053,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,attention was a partially submerged fir tree near the center of the
7054,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"ford, and lodged against it was a chicken coop. Were there chickens in"
7055,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"it, do you ask? No; if there had been when the angry waves picked it"
7056,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"up there were none now, but instead, the sweetest little _kitten_ you"
7057,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"ever saw; and crouched down on the trunk of the tree, with his"
7058,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"aristocratic paws resting on the end of the coop, was the mysterious"
7059,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"Woggy, gravely contemplating the kitten, as it minced at the food the"
7060,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,generous dog had brought it. How proud Edwin felt of Woggy as he
7061,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"looked and understood the scene. How Woggy, in his solitary rambles,"
7062,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"must have discovered the forlorn kitten, who had been suddenly torn"
7063,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"from her home, far up the valley perhaps, and borne, half drowned and"
7064,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"thoroughly frightened, on the rushing torrent, until her box, in which"
7065,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"the rising waters had found her taking her afternoon nap, had lodged"
7066,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"against the tree. Edwin wanted to rescue her, and take her home. This"
7067,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"was his first impulse, but how? The pond was wide and deep, and he had"
7068,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"no boat, nor any other means of reaching her; so he decided to wait"
7069,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"until the water got lower, until he could devise some plan. He"
7070,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"returned home in great amazement, and told the story of Woggy's"
7071,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,wonderful doings. Florence was all excitement and sympathy in a
7072,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"moment, and wanted to go at once but could not. But what a delicious"
7073,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,hugging and petting Woggy got when he returned home that night. When
7074,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"Edwin found them, the kitten was snuggled up as close to her brute"
7075,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,protector as the slats would allow; she would put her tongue through
7076,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"and lick his paws, which process seemed to give him the liveliest"
7077,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"satisfaction. Edwin whistled to him to come home with him, but he only"
7078,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,wagged his bushy tail and looked at his frail charge as much as to
7079,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"say, ""I can't go just now."" Just think of the idea of protection"
7080,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,entering the head of a dog! but it did. Some animals seem almost to
7081,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"reason. We all know a perfect horror of water all cats have, they will"
7082,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"not go into water voluntarily. This poor little thing, surrounded by"
7083,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"water, must have died of starvation had not kind-hearted Woggy found"
7084,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,and cared for her.
7085,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,
7086,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"The next day, Edwin, provided with a long board and other means of"
7087,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"rescuing the distressed stranger, started for the pond. Just as he"
7088,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"left the house, with Florence calling out from the porch some parting"
7089,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"injunctions of carefulness, what was their astonishment to see Woggy"
7090,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,coming along the road with the kitten in his mouth; the sagacious dog
7091,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,had evidently thought that his keepless little charge needed more care
7092,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"than he could give her, and brought her unharmed to his mistress. When"
7093,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"he had deposited the kitten at her feet, he looked up in her eyes as"
7094,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"though he wanted to tell her something, and he really looked as if he"
7095,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,could almost talk. When Florence took up the pretty thing she
7096,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"exclaimed, ""You poor little waif! Where did you come from?"" The little"
7097,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"waif could not tell, but looked as if she wanted to. She was pure"
7098,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"white in color, with a water-stained ribbon and tiny silver bell"
7099,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,"around her neck. Edwin said she should be called Waif, and Waif she"
7100,WAIF'S ROMANCE.,was ever after called in that house.

7163,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,
7164,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"The trunks were strapped on the back of the carriage; we children,"
7165,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"with Nurse, were bundled inside; the door shut--the driver snapped his"
7166,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"whip--and without any time for last good-byes, we were whirled away to"
7167,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"the station. How excited and glad we were, for Papa and Mamma were to"
7168,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"follow us next day, and we left the city far behind to spend the whole"
7169,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,beautiful summer at Willow-spring. The very first day after our
7170,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"arrival, we were out--Willie, my brother, Elsie, our little"
7171,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"four-year-old sister, and myself--scouring the premises, and I guess"
7172,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,there were not a nook or corner we had not visited by night. It was a
7173,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"lovely place, with broad shady walks through which we raced, or Willie"
7174,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"drove us as two spirited young colts, for like most boys he was rather"

7176,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,
7177,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,I wish I could tell you of the grand time we had that summer. We
7178,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"formed the acquaintance of several little neighbor children, who"
7179,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"proved pleasant playmates, and together we would wander through the"
7180,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"cool leafy woods, or roam the sunny meadows gathering sweet wild"
7181,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"strawberries and armsful of golden-eyed daisies, and taking our"
7182,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"treasures home, would have a little treat on the shady veranda, and"
7183,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"garland ourselves with long daisy chains, making believe we were"
7184,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,woodland fairies. Once in a while the rabbits from the near wood ran
7185,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"across the garden path, timid and shy little creatures at first--they"
7186,A SUMMER AT WILLOW-SPRING.,"grew quite tame from our feeding--and Elsie dearly loved her bunnies,"

7317,WINDSOR CASTLE.,This ancient and splendid pile is a fitting residence for the
7318,WINDSOR CASTLE.,sovereigns of England. It impresses one with the idea of supreme
7319,WINDSOR CASTLE.,"grandeur and formidable strength, but it has reached its present"
7320,WINDSOR CASTLE.,magnificence by constant embellishments and additions by successive
7321,WINDSOR CASTLE.,sovereigns.
7322,WINDSOR CASTLE.,
7323,WINDSOR CASTLE.,"It owes its origin to William the Conqueror, that bold and progressive"

7327,WINDSOR CASTLE.,

7406,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,Among the sad episodes in the illustrated history of English
7407,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"sovereigns, not one is more pathetic or impressive than the story of"
7408,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"the two little Princes, sons of Edward IV. This King had an ambitious"
7409,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"and unscrupulous brother, called Richard, Duke of Gloucester."
7410,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7411,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"At the time of the King's death, this man was at the head of an army"
7412,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"in Scotland, which was entirely devoted to him, and he felt strong and"
7413,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,equal to undertaking any bold and unlawful measure to obtain the
7414,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"crown, which rightfully belonged to Edward's son, the young Prince of"
7415,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,Wales.
7416,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7417,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"Upon receiving the news of his brother's death, Richard clothed"
7418,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,himself and his large retinue in deep mourning and proceeded in great
7419,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"haste to London, taking the oath of loyalty on the way, and making"
7420,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,many protestations of interest and affection for the fatherless boys.
7421,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7422,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,The young Prince of Wales received him with many expressions of regard
7423,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"and respectful consideration, as befitted a paternal uncle, and placed"
7424,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,undoubted faith in his suggestions; the Duke thus found it an easy
7425,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"matter to direct his movements, and the selection of his counselors"
7426,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"and servants. Two of these, who were favorite and loyal friends, he"
7427,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"caused to be seized on a frivolous accusation, and they were taken to"
7428,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,a distant castle as prisoners. Other measures were taken to isolate
7429,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"him, and in a few days the young King was completely in the hands of"
7430,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,the terrible Duke of Gloucester.
7431,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7432,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"From one high-handed act of usurpation to another, assisted by"
7433,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"unprincipled, ambitious men, he proceeded, evidently aiming to secure"
7434,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,the crown for his own head.
7435,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7436,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"Under pretense of placing the Prince in greater safety, and removing"
7437,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"him from persons who might influence him, to the detriment of the"
7438,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"peace and welfare of the kingdom, he was conducted, in great state, to"
7439,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,the Tower; his uncle assuming the office of Lord Protector of the
7440,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,King.
7441,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7442,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"Upon gaining the entire custody of the royal lad, he sent a large"
7443,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"number of dignitaries to the royal mother, to persuade her to allow"
7444,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,the other little boy to be taken to the Tower to keep his brother
7445,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"company. The Prince was allowed to proceed thither, and Richard, now"
7446,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"having them both at his mercy, determined upon their death."
7447,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7448,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"The Governor of the Tower was, it seems, a man of at least human"
7449,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"feelings, and when he was ordered by Richard, ""In some wise to put the"
7450,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"children to death,"" utterly refused to perform so dangerous and"
7451,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,horrible an act.
7452,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7453,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"Richard then sent for the keys of the Tower, to keep in his possession"
7454,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"twenty-four hours, and gave them, and the command of the Tower for"
7455,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"that time, to Sir James Tyrrel, his master of horse."
7456,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7457,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"This man procured two assassins, who proceeded, at dead of night, to"
7458,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"the chamber of the sleeping Princes. They lay in each other's arms, as"

7460,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"assassins, falling upon them with their ruffian strength, smothered"
7461,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"them with the bed-clothes, ""Keeping the feather pillows hard upon"
7462,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"their mouths."""
7463,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7464,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"When the deed was done, Tyrrel stepped into the chamber, to take a"
7465,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"hasty view of the dead bodies, which were then, by his orders, buried"

7467,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,
7468,THE LITTLE PRINCES.,"Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had no further obstacle in assuming the"

7551,MARY AND HER LAMB.,This is the title of one of the most familiar poems in the English
7552,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"language, but few people know its history."
7553,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7554,MARY AND HER LAMB.,Most of our young readers will be surprised to hear that the
7555,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"well-known nursery song of ""Mary had a Little Lamb"" is a true story,"
7556,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"and that ""Mary"" is still living, says an exchange."
7557,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7558,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"About seventy years ago she was a little girl, the daughter of a"
7559,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"farmer in Worcester county, Mass. She was very fond of going with her"
7560,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"father to the fields to see the sheep, and one day they found a baby"
7561,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"lamb, which was thought to be dead."
7562,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7563,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"Kind-hearted little Mary, however, lifted it up in her arms, and as it"
7564,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"seemed to breathe she carried it home, made it a warm bed near the"
7565,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"stove, and nursed it tenderly. Great was her delight when, after weeks"
7566,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"of careful feeding and watching, her little patient began to grow well"
7567,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"and strong, and soon after it was able to run about. It knew its young"
7568,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"mistress perfectly, always came at her call, and was happy only when"
7569,MARY AND HER LAMB.,at her side.
7570,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7571,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"One day it followed her to the village school, and not knowing what"
7572,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"else to do with it, she put it under her desk and covered it with her"
7573,MARY AND HER LAMB.,shawl.
7574,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7575,MARY AND HER LAMB.,There it stayed until Mary was called up to the teacher's desk to say
7576,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"her lesson, and then the lamb walked quietly after her, and the other"
7577,MARY AND HER LAMB.,children burst out laughing. So the teacher had to shut the little
7578,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"girl's pet in the woodshed until school was out. Soon after this, a"
7579,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"young student, named John Rollstone, wrote a little poem about Mary"
7580,MARY AND HER LAMB.,and her lamb and presented it to her. The lamb grew to be a sheep and
7581,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"lived for many years, and when at last it died Mary grieved so much"
7582,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"for it that her mother took some of its wool, which was as ""white as"
7583,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"snow,"" and knitted a pair of stockings for her, to wear in remembrance"
7584,MARY AND HER LAMB.,of her darling.
7585,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7586,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"Some years after the lamb's death, Mrs. Sarah Hall, a celebrated woman"
7587,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"who wrote books, composed some verses about Mary's lamb and added them"
7588,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"to those written by John Rollstone, making the complete poem as we"
7589,MARY AND HER LAMB.,know it. Mary took such good care of the stockings made of her lamb's
7590,MARY AND HER LAMB.,fleece that when she was a grown-up woman she gave one of them to a
7591,MARY AND HER LAMB.,church fair in Boston.
7592,MARY AND HER LAMB.,
7593,MARY AND HER LAMB.,As soon as it became known that the stocking was made from the fleece
7594,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"of ""Mary's little lamb,"" every one wanted a piece of it; so the"
7595,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"stocking was raveled out, and the yarn cut into small pieces. Each"
7596,MARY AND HER LAMB.,"piece was tied to a card on which ""Mary"" wrote her full name, and"
7597,MARY AND HER LAMB.,these cards sold so well that they brought the large sum of $140 in

7638,A. DE G. H.,"Con, who were the greatest of chums, as well as the noisiest, merriest"
7639,A. DE G. H.,boys in Curryville Academy--were to go into camp for the next two
7640,A. DE G. H.,"weeks, by way of spending part of their vacation. They could hardly"
7641,A. DE G. H.,"wait for school to close, and over the pages of Greenleaf danced,"
7642,A. DE G. H.,"those last two days, unknown quantities of fishing tackle, tents, and"
7643,A. DE G. H.,the regular regalia of a camping out-fit. They talked of it by day and
7644,A. DE G. H.,dreamed of it by night.
7645,A. DE G. H.,
7646,A. DE G. H.,At last the great day dawned--dawned upon three of the most
7647,A. DE G. H.,"grotesque-looking specimens of boyhood, arrayed in the oldest and"
7648,A. DE G. H.,"worst fitting clothes they could find; for, as they said, in the most"
7649,A. DE G. H.,"expressive boy language--""We are in for a rattlin' good time, and"
7650,A. DE G. H.,"don't want to be togged out."" They and their effects were taken by"
7651,A. DE G. H.,"wagon over to the Lake Shore, about four miles distant, to establish"
7652,A. DE G. H.,"their camp under the shadow of old Rumble Sides, a lofty crag or"
7653,A. DE G. H.,boulder.
7654,A. DE G. H.,
7655,A. DE G. H.,"Boys, I wish you could have seen them that night, in their little"
7656,A. DE G. H.,"woodland home; really, it was quite attractive. They worked like"
7657,A. DE G. H.,"beavers all day--cutting away the brush, driving stakes to tie down"
7658,A. DE G. H.,"the little white tent, digging a trench all around in case of rain,"
7659,A. DE G. H.,"and building a fire-place of stone, with a tall, forked stick on which"
7660,A. DE G. H.,"to hang the kettle. A long board, under the shady trees, served as"
7661,A. DE G. H.,table.
7662,A. DE G. H.,
7663,A. DE G. H.,"Too tired to make a fire that night, they ate a cold lunch, and threw"
7664,A. DE G. H.,themselves on their bed--which was a blanket thrown over pine
7665,A. DE G. H.,"boughs--untied the tent flaps to let in air, and slept a happy,"
7666,A. DE G. H.,dreamless sleep.
7667,A. DE G. H.,
7668,A. DE G. H.,"The next morning, early, they were up, and, after taking a cold plunge"
7669,A. DE G. H.,"in the lake, built a brisk fire, boiled coffee, and roasted potatoes"
7670,A. DE G. H.,"for breakfast. They then bailed out the punt, which was their only"
7671,A. DE G. H.,"sailing craft, and put off for an all-day's fishing excursion. Several"
7672,A. DE G. H.,"days, with fine weather, passed, and the boys declared they were"
7673,A. DE G. H.,"having a royal time, and that camping was the only life to lead."
7674,A. DE G. H.,
7675,A. DE G. H.,"They had much difficulty to settle upon a name, but finally decided"
7676,A. DE G. H.,"that ""Camp Trio"" was most appropriate."
7677,A. DE G. H.,
7678,A. DE G. H.,"One night they were suddenly awakened by a deep, roaring sound; the"
7679,A. DE G. H.,"wind blew fiercely, it rained hard, but the noise was not of thunder,"
7680,A. DE G. H.,it seemed almost human; nearer and nearer it came! The three lads sat
7681,A. DE G. H.,"up in the semi-darkness, and peered at each other with scared faces."
7682,A. DE G. H.,
7683,A. DE G. H.,"""It's Old Rumble broke loose and coming down on us,"" said Con, in a"
7684,A. DE G. H.,"ghostly whisper. ""Hush!"" and the trio clutched in a cold shiver, as a"
7685,A. DE G. H.,"crackling of twigs was heard outside, a heavy tread, a long, low moan,"
7686,A. DE G. H.,a horrible silence.
7687,A. DE G. H.,
7688,A. DE G. H.,"""It was the Leviathan, I guess,"" said Tom, with a ghastly attempt at"
7689,A. DE G. H.,"smiling, as the early morning light stole through the flaps. At length"
7690,A. DE G. H.,"they moved their stiffened limbs and peeped out. Oh, how it did pour!"
7691,A. DE G. H.,"No fire, no fishing, no any thing to-day. Pretty soon a shout from"
7692,A. DE G. H.,"Ned, who had been cautiously prowling around to find the cause of"
7693,A. DE G. H.,their late fright.
7694,A. DE G. H.,
7695,A. DE G. H.,"""Oh, boys, it's too rich! Why, it was Potter's old cow, down here last"
7696,A. DE G. H.,"night, bawling for her calf that was after our towels, as usual--look"
7697,A. DE G. H.,"here!"" and he held up three or four dingy, chewed-looking articles,"
7698,A. DE G. H.,"which had hung on a tree to dry, and might have been towels once. The"
7699,A. DE G. H.,boys broke into a hearty laugh at their own expense. The day was very
7700,A. DE G. H.,"long and dull, and the next, stories and jokes fell flat, cold"
7701,A. DE G. H.,"victuals didn't relish, they began to feel quite blue. The third day"
7702,A. DE G. H.,Farmer Potter appeared upon the scene.
7703,A. DE G. H.,
7704,A. DE G. H.,"""What on airth ye doin' here; trespassin' on other folks' grounds?"
7705,A. DE G. H.,"Mebby ye don't know it's agin the law!"""
7706,A. DE G. H.,
7707,A. DE G. H.,"The boys felt a trifle uneasy, but answered him politely."
7708,A. DE G. H.,
7709,A. DE G. H.,"""Hevin' _fun_, be ye! Wall, I'll vow, settin' in the wet, eatin' cold"
7710,A. DE G. H.,"rations, haint _my_ idee of _fun_."" And away he stalked."
7711,A. DE G. H.,
7712,A. DE G. H.,The boys looked at each other.
7713,A. DE G. H.,
7714,A. DE G. H.,"""I say, fellers,"" said Con, ""a piece of pie and a hunk of fresh bread"
7715,A. DE G. H.,"_wouldn't_ go bad--eh?"""
7716,A. DE G. H.,
7717,A. DE G. H.,The two answered with a hungry look.
7718,A. DE G. H.,
7719,A. DE G. H.,"""But let's tough it out over Sunday, or they'll all laugh at us."" And"
7720,A. DE G. H.,"so they did; but it was the longest, dreariest Sabbath they ever"
7721,A. DE G. H.,spent.
7722,A. DE G. H.,
7723,A. DE G. H.,"""I'd rather learn ten chapters in Chronicles,"" Tom affirmed, ""than put"
7724,A. DE G. H.,"in another such a Sunday."""
7725,A. DE G. H.,
7726,A. DE G. H.,"They had, in the main, a jolly time, but the ending was not as"
7727,A. DE G. H.,"brilliant as they had looked for. They never regretted going, but the"
7728,A. DE G. H.,"next year took a larger party, and went for a shorter time."

7790,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"The work progressed safely and rapidly for awhile. Geraniums, roses,"

7801,EARTHEN VESSELS.,that with a loud crash it parted in the middle and lay in pieces at

7810,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""The pot, Charley, was made of clay; the same weak material from which"

7825,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7826,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"That afternoon, the three, started for the pottery works. Mr. Sands,"
7827,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"the proprietor, kindly received them, and fully explained all his"
7828,EARTHEN VESSELS.,processes. First he pointed out what seemed to Charley a heap of dry
7829,EARTHEN VESSELS.,hard common dirt; taking a little piece of this he dipped it into a
7830,EARTHEN VESSELS.,basin of water and then squeezing and pressing it in his hand it soon
7831,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"became soft, and plastic, so that it could be wrought to any shape. He"
7832,EARTHEN VESSELS.,then led the party to another room where a young man was engaged in
7833,EARTHEN VESSELS.,thus softening large masses. He would first crumble the hard earth
7834,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"into fine pieces; then wet and pack it together into a ""loaf,"" so"
7835,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"Charley called it, and then raising it over his head throw it again"
7836,EARTHEN VESSELS.,with all his might upon the table before him until it became soft and
7837,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"smooth through all its bulk. This, Mr. Sands said, was called ""wedging"
7838,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"the clay,"" and that it was now ready for ""throwing"" into shape."
7839,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7840,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Will it come into shape if you just throw it?"" said Charley."
7841,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7842,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"Mr. Sands laughed heartily at this, and answered, ""come and see;"" and"
7843,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"taking up one of the softened ""loaves,"" to use Charley's word for"
7844,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"them, he led the way to the next room. The young man who had been"
7845,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""wedging"" now followed and placed himself at a large wheel which was"
7846,EARTHEN VESSELS.,connected by a strap or belt with a table at which Mr. Sands seated
7847,EARTHEN VESSELS.,himself.
7848,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7849,EARTHEN VESSELS.,[Illustration: HOW POTS AND PANS ARE MADE.]
7850,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7851,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"Upon the table was another little table, round and low, and upon"
7852,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"this Mr. Sands placed his ""loaf."" Then the young man began to turn the"
7853,EARTHEN VESSELS.,wheel and the loaf began to spin round very rapidly. Mr. Sands next
7854,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"pressed his finger right through the middle of the clay, so farming"
7855,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"the hole which we always see at the bottom of flower-pots. Then, as it"
7856,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"spun round, he worked the clay gradually upwards and sloped it"
7857,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"outwards, using both hands, and holding the edges with his fingers and"
7858,EARTHEN VESSELS.,thumbs.
7859,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7860,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"Before Charley could express his surprise, the little roll of clay was"
7861,EARTHEN VESSELS.,changed into a flower-pot. With a square iron tool called a _rib_ it
7862,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"was smoothed outside, and then the pot was lifted on a board. One"
7863,EARTHEN VESSELS.,after another followed till a long row was ready and they were carried
7864,EARTHEN VESSELS.,off to be dried.
7865,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7866,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""How do you know when to leave off stretching it?"" asked Mary of the"
7867,EARTHEN VESSELS.,potter.
7868,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7869,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"He laughed, and pointed to a small iron gauge on the table. As soon as"
7870,EARTHEN VESSELS.,the pot reached this he knew he must leave off stretching it out. This
7871,EARTHEN VESSELS.,iron is of course put higher or lower according to the size required.
7872,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7873,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Now I'll make you a pitcher, missie,"" said the good-natured man, and"
7874,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"with the same kind of clay, just rounding it a bit and giving a"
7875,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"cunning little pinch to form the spout, he made quite a pretty jug."
7876,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7877,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Where's the handle?"" asked Charley."
7878,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7879,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Oh, that can't go on yet, sir! We must wait till the jug is dry, for"
7880,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"we could not press it tight enough to make it stick."""
7881,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7882,EARTHEN VESSELS.,Bread-pans and washing-pans are made in exactly the same way as
7883,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"flower-pots, being moulded by the hand into different forms. When the"
7884,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"pots and pans leave the potter's wheel they are taken, as we saw, to"
7885,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"dry, and great care is required to keep them at a certain heat, for if"
7886,EARTHEN VESSELS.,the frost gets to them now they crack and are useless.
7887,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7888,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Here's a comical little pot!"" exclaimed Charley, holding up a wee"
7889,EARTHEN VESSELS.,one.
7890,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7891,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""We call them _long Toms_,"" said Mr. Sands. ""They are mostly used by"
7892,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"nursery-gardeners, because they take so little room."""
7893,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7894,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""How long do they take to dry?"" asked Mary, looking longingly at her"
7895,EARTHEN VESSELS.,little jug.
7896,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7897,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""About a day; so we will leave your jug with the others, and go to the"
7898,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"kiln to see how they will be burnt to-morrow."""
7899,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7900,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"The kiln was round, with a big doorway, called a wicket."
7901,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7902,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"The pots and pans are put inside, great care being taken that they"
7903,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"should not touch each other, or they would stick like loaves of bread."
7904,EARTHEN VESSELS.,Pans are first glazed with a mixture of blue or red lead. The fire is
7905,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"burning below, and there are holes to allow the flames to pass upwards"
7906,EARTHEN VESSELS.,amongst the pottery. When the kiln is full the wicket is bricked up
7907,EARTHEN VESSELS.,and daubed over with road-mud.
7908,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7909,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Fancy using such dirty stuff!"" said Mary."
7910,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7911,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""The manure in it makes it stick, just as hair does in mortar. Clay"
7912,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"would crack with the heat. So you see, dear, there's nothing so dirty"
7913,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"or so common that it may not be of some use in the world."""
7914,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7915,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""How do you know when they are cooked enough?"" asked Charley."
7916,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7917,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""I'll show you,"" said Mr. Sands, and he immediately led us to a small"
7918,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"door, which opened some way up the kiln."
7919,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7920,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""This is called the crown,"" said Mr. Sands."
7921,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7922,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"It was a flat surface, with four holes which showed the red heat"
7923,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"below, and looked like little volcanoes in a good temper."
7924,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7925,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""Do you see those iron rods hanging like walking-sticks in the"
7926,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"furnace?"" asked our guide. ""Well, those are called _trials_, and at"
7927,EARTHEN VESSELS.,the end of each is a lump of clay and glaze. If the glaze is burnt
7928,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"enough we suppose that the whole batch is done, but we sometimes make"
7929,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"a mistake and spoil a lot."""
7930,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7931,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""What is done next?"" asked Charley."
7932,EARTHEN VESSELS.,
7933,EARTHEN VESSELS.,"""If they are properly burnt, they are allowed to cool gradually, and"

7990,A BATTLE.,
7991,A BATTLE.,
7992,A BATTLE.,Do you like accounts of battles? Here is one for you. I shall have to
7993,A BATTLE.,"tell of a well-disciplined army, and some hard fighting, as well as of"
7994,A BATTLE.,a victory.
7995,A BATTLE.,
7996,A BATTLE.,"The scene is a quiet country district, with fields and hedge-rows, not"
7997,A BATTLE.,"looking a bit like war and bloodshed, and the time is a summer"
7998,A BATTLE.,"afternoon, hot, for it is July, and a haze is over the mountains,"
7999,A BATTLE.,"which rise a little way behind, as silent witnesses of the fray. The"
8000,A BATTLE.,"sun begins to decline, and as the air grows cooler the army has orders"
8001,A BATTLE.,"to start. There is a short delay of preparations, and then the"
8002,A BATTLE.,"warriors pour forth; not in confusion, but in a compact, unbroken"
8003,A BATTLE.,"column, each keeping to the ranks in perfect order, and never"
8004,A BATTLE.,"diverging from them. At first the army follows the high road, but ere"
8005,A BATTLE.,"long it passes through an opening in the hedge, and crosses the field"
8006,A BATTLE.,"on the other side. Still the soldiers march on, never hindered, never"
8007,A BATTLE.,straggling out of place. It must have been a clever commander-in-chief
8008,A BATTLE.,to have trained them into such admirable obedience.
8009,A BATTLE.,
8010,A BATTLE.,Presently a fortress rises before them--_that_ is the object of their
8011,A BATTLE.,"expedition; rather, it is something within the citadel that they are"
8012,A BATTLE.,"sent to get, and have it they _will_. Not without a struggle, though,"
8013,A BATTLE.,"for the enemy is on guard, and when he sees the hostile army"
8014,A BATTLE.,"approaching, he sallies out to battle. He has no idea of surrendering"
8015,A BATTLE.,without a fight for it.
8016,A BATTLE.,
8017,A BATTLE.,"The invaders gather up their forces and charge bravely up the hill,"
8018,A BATTLE.,"and in an instant, hand to hand, or something very like it, the foes"
8019,A BATTLE.,"are locked together in desperate conflict. Neither have they any guns,"
8020,A BATTLE.,"but they carry sharp weapons with them, and soon the field is strewn"
8021,A BATTLE.,with the dead and dying.
8022,A BATTLE.,
8023,A BATTLE.,"The fight thickens--the issue is doubtful, but not long--the defenders"
8024,A BATTLE.,"are routed, and the assailants press forward to the citadel. Most"
8025,A BATTLE.,"skillful are they, for with neither cannon nor battering-rams they"
8026,A BATTLE.,"speedily make a breach in the walls, and in they rush, pouring through"
8027,A BATTLE.,the street and lanes of the devoted city. Yet they do not destroy
8028,A BATTLE.,it--they do not kill the inhabitants--they do not even stay within the
8029,A BATTLE.,walls so hardly won. In a very short space of time they return as they
8030,A BATTLE.,"came, save that each bears a portion of the spoil for which they came."
8031,A BATTLE.,"They form in order once again, they march in line, they regain their"
8032,A BATTLE.,"own quarters, but each one carrying--would you believe it?--a _young"
8033,A BATTLE.,slave_.
8034,A BATTLE.,
8035,A BATTLE.,[Illustration: {ANTS HEADING OUT ON AN EXPEDITION.}]
8036,A BATTLE.,
8037,A BATTLE.,"Yes, the army did not care to conquer the strange city; the expedition"
8038,A BATTLE.,was organized solely and entirely that they might steal the young and
8039,A BATTLE.,"bring them up in their own colony as slaves. For, through the long"
8040,A BATTLE.,"influence of evil habits, the race to which these warriors belong have"
8041,A BATTLE.,"lost their natural powers, and so have now to be waited on, fed, and"
8042,A BATTLE.,altogether taken care of by its slaves. With food before them they
8043,A BATTLE.,would starve unless the slaves put it into their mouths.
8044,A BATTLE.,
8045,A BATTLE.,"If they want to change their abode, the slaves must make the new"
8046,A BATTLE.,"habitation ready, and then carry their masters on their backs to reach"
8047,A BATTLE.,"it. If the children have to be taken care of, the slaves must be the"
8048,A BATTLE.,"nurses. In fact, _fighting_ is the one single thing they _can_ do, and"
8049,A BATTLE.,"that, as we have seen, they do well. As the supply of slaves is"
8050,A BATTLE.,"necessary to their existence, every now and then they have to go and"
8051,A BATTLE.,help themselves in the way we have just seen them do; and though the
8052,A BATTLE.,"idea of slavery is abhorrent to every mind, we must allow that they"
8053,A BATTLE.,"are brave soldiers, and under excellent discipline."
8054,A BATTLE.,
8055,A BATTLE.,"Now, can you tell me who the soldiers are? Go back to your history"
8056,A BATTLE.,"stories and think. Some old Roman race, perhaps, or the early"
8057,A BATTLE.,"inhabitants of Britain, when people knew no better? Or some tribe of"
8058,A BATTLE.,"savages in America, or the South Sea islands at the present time? Nay,"
8059,A BATTLE.,"you must guess again, or shall I tell you? Yes, you give it up. Well,"
8060,A BATTLE.,"then, it is a people ""not strong;"" small and insignificant, yet wise,"
8061,A BATTLE.,"for this is what the Bible says, ""Go to the ANT, consider her ways and"
8062,A BATTLE.,"be wise.""--Prov. vi:10."
8063,A BATTLE.,
8064,A BATTLE.,"This race of warriors is none other than the slave-keeping ant,"
8065,A BATTLE.,(_Polyergus rufescens_). I do not think you would meet with it in our
8066,A BATTLE.,"woods, but in Switzerland and other countries it is common. Huber, who"
8067,A BATTLE.,"wrote so much about bees and ants, first witnessed an attack near"
8068,A BATTLE.,Geneva. I should tell you that the young which they carry off are the
8069,A BATTLE.,"larva or young grubs, which, transferred to the nests of the"
8070,A BATTLE.,"conquerors, soon become ants, and live the rest of their lives in"
8071,A BATTLE.,"serving them, and waiting on them, as slaves or servants would their"
8072,A BATTLE.,masters.
8073,A BATTLE.,
8074,A BATTLE.,How extraordinary! Do they pine for their own kind? Are they happy in
8075,A BATTLE.,"their bondage? We do not know, but as far as we can judge they render"
8076,A BATTLE.,"a willing and cheerful service, forgetting themselves in what they do"
8077,A BATTLE.,"for others. Then, of course, they are happy; we need not repeat the"
8078,A BATTLE.,question; we are only lost in wonder at this strange and interesting
8079,A BATTLE.,page in Nature's book.

8284,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"What should we see but a little creature, grotesque and hideous, that"
8285,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"made its way round in the water, with astounding celerity, throwing"
8286,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"out legs or claws, or whatever they were, from every point of its"
8287,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,circumference. Its body was flat and was a green color above and pink
8288,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"under, and to add to its alarming appearance, it looked at us with two"
8289,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"black eyes, in a very sinister and uncanny manner. We looked at each"
8290,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"other with blanched faces and speechless horror, and then kept a sharp"
8291,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"lookout, lest it might take it into its head (we couldn't tell if it"

8296,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"amusing after a few moments, and from being horribly frightened, we"
8297,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,became interested when we found it did not attempt the offensive. We
8298,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"gave it some lunch and called it ""Jack Deadeye,"" and for the whole"

8300,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8301,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"""Let us take him back with us,"" I proposed. ""We can get him into a"
8302,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"pail, and then we can have him in some pool nearer home, and see what"

8305,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8306,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"My knowledge of natural history had always been lamentably meager, and"

8318,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8319,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"We all rushed again to the edge of the rocks to look at him, with"
8320,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,added wonder.
8321,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8322,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"""Well, we'll take that tad home on a pole, any way,"" said Nannie"
8323,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"White, who was the cutest girl to say things in the whole crowd. She"
8324,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,immediately ran off to secure a piece of drift that was tumbling about
8325,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,on the wet sand. But how to get him into a pail was the next problem.
8326,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,A committee of the whole was called. I thought we could obstruct his
8327,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"path by putting the mouth of the pail in front of him, and then when"
8328,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"he sailed into it, we could instantly pull him out. This was decided"
8329,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,upon; but how to get it down to him without falling in? A bright idea
8330,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"struck me. I whipped off my flannel sash, and running it through the"
8331,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"handle, dashed it into the water; but that proceeding only frightened"
8332,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,him--we must move more cautiously. We worked for an hour and had him
8333,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"in twice, but were so excited both times that he escaped."
8334,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8335,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"First time, Totty Rainsford shouted, ""We've got him!"" and immediately"
8336,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"rolled off the rocks, head first, into the water. We were all so"
8337,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"scared, with the water splashing, and she screaming at the top of her"
8338,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"voice, ""Save me! Save me!"" that Jack got away. She scrambled out"
8339,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"pretty lively, and when we got him in again, we were all seized with"
8340,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"another fit of laughing at Totty, who, in her moist predicament, was"
8341,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"jumping round to dry herself, because she didn't want to go home, that"
8342,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"he crawled out as leisurely as possible. But we secured him at last,"
8343,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"safe in the pail; and to prevent his crawling out, I clapped my sailor"
8344,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"hat over the top of it, and the elastic kept it down tight. We put the"
8345,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"pole through the handle and Estella and myself took hold of the ends,"
8346,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"and we came near losing him every few minutes, owing to the"
8347,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"inequalities of the ground. The pail would slide down to either end,"
8348,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"as the pole inclined, and Estella would drop it and scream when she"
8349,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"saw the pail traveling noiselessly toward her, and if it hadn't been"
8350,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"for my happy thought of putting the hat over him, he'd have got away"
8351,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"to his ""happy hunting grounds,"" or rather, waters, in short order."
8352,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8353,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"We arrived at the hotel at last, with Jack all safe, and the rest of"
8354,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"the girls went to dress for dinner, and left me to find the boys, to"
8355,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"help me deposit him in a secure place, for we were sure we should very"
8356,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,greatly astonish the boarders and achieve renown as having discovered

8358,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8359,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,The boys were in a perfect ecstacy of curiosity to see what the girls
8360,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"had caught. When I carefully took off the hat, I found the water had"
8361,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"all leaked out, and his monstership lay kicking and crawling at the"
8362,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,bottom.
8363,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,
8364,HOW THE DAYS WENT AT SEA-GULL BEACH.,"""Ho! ho! ho!"" shouted Willie, ""is that what-cher call a curiosity?"""

8710,ON TRIAL.,Twelve cats had to be found who could say that they were not quite

8712,ON TRIAL.,"stay-at-home cats, who did not know what was going on outside of the"
8713,ON TRIAL.,comfortable houses where they lived. These twelve cats were to be the
8714,ON TRIAL.,"jury, and it was their duty to hear all that the lawyers and the"
8715,ON TRIAL.,"witnesses had to say about Hal's doings, and then to tell whether or"
8716,ON TRIAL.,not they thought he ought to be punished.
8717,ON TRIAL.,
8718,ON TRIAL.,At last the day of the trial came; Judge Thomas White sat down in his
8719,ON TRIAL.,big chair and took his pen; the lawyers took their places; the twelve
8720,ON TRIAL.,"jury cats were brought in, and put in a high box, so they could not"
8721,ON TRIAL.,jump out and run away. Hal was brought in and put in the prisoner's
8722,ON TRIAL.,"box, as they call it; and Christopher Gray, his mother's old cat, took"
8723,ON TRIAL.,"his place beside Hal. Three cats, called ""reporters,"" came in with"
8724,ON TRIAL.,"pockets full of paper and pencils, to write down all that is said; to"
8725,ON TRIAL.,"print in the newspapers, for all cats in the world to read."
8726,ON TRIAL.,
8727,ON TRIAL.,The first witness to tell all the bad she knew about Hal was his

8729,ON TRIAL.,"blue ribbon tied around her neck, as she sat on the witness stand"
8730,ON TRIAL.,telling how Hal chased her from cellar to garret; and stepped on her
8731,ON TRIAL.,tail; and gave her saucer of milk to the dog Jack whenever he got a

8738,ON TRIAL.,"had thrown a dipper of hot water, was called to the witness stand."
8739,ON TRIAL.,Poor old thing! the hot water had taken the fur off his back. Then
8740,ON TRIAL.,"came another cat, limping up to the witness stand, whose leg had been"
8741,ON TRIAL.,broken by a stone which Hal had thrown. There were so many witnesses
8742,ON TRIAL.,that it would make my story too long to tell about them all. All that
8743,ON TRIAL.,"Christopher Gray could say in Hal's favor was: ""He has a good mother."""

8747,ON TRIAL.,"When the jury had heard all that was to be said, they went out of the"
8748,ON TRIAL.,room together; in five minutes they came back; all agreed that Hal

8750,ON TRIAL.,"said: ""Albert Keys, you are found guilty of great cruelty to good cats"
8751,ON TRIAL.,"everywhere. I must, therefore, pronounce sentence upon you. You must"
8752,ON TRIAL.,"go with us to Cat town for two days and one night."""
8753,ON TRIAL.,
8754,ON TRIAL.,"There were tears in Hal's eyes, but the Judge had no pity on him, and"
8755,ON TRIAL.,"he called in some of the strongest cats to take him. Oh! what a long,"
8756,ON TRIAL.,"hard way it was; over fences, under houses, and through the barns. It"
8757,ON TRIAL.,"was hard work for Hal to keep up with them, but they made him. What a"
8758,ON TRIAL.,time he had after he got to Cat town. All of the cats gathered around
8759,ON TRIAL.,"him, and howled at him, and scratched his face and hands, and made him"

8944,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"children themselves. Mr. Dickens had a pet cat, that was always in his"
8945,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"library. Strange to say, it had no name. That was no matter, because"
8946,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,the cat could not hear. He was deaf. But he liked very much to be
8947,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"petted, and plainly showed sometimes that he was not pleased to have"
8948,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"his master do any thing else. One evening, when Mr. Dickens was"
8949,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"sitting at the table reading, his candle suddenly went out. He did not"
8950,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"know why it should have done so, but he got up and lighted it. In a"
8951,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"few moments it began to get dark again, and he looked up quickly at"
8952,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"the candle, and saw puss just raising his paw to put it out. ""What did"
8953,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,"he do?"" He gave the cat a loving little pat and went on with his"
8954,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,reading. What a sly cat was that to find a way to make his master
8955,PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE.,notice him.

8978,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Archie Phillips was the little boy's name, and he and his sister had"
8979,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,got a holiday and were watching a party of older children from the
8980,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Wynne High School, who had come down to the river to spend the"
8981,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"afternoon. There was Algernon Wright with a large model yacht, and"
8982,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Willie Schofield, the Mayor's son, with a new silver-mounted fishing"
8983,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,rod. They were all as happy and full of frolic as all boys in the
8984,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"spring-time of life ought to be. Little Archie was, however, of a"
8985,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"morose temperament, and did not share in any of the amusements."
8986,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
8987,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"The village of Wynne is a fishing village, and is approached from the"
8988,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,sea by a beautiful cove on the Cornish coast. The town is built on the

8990,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Wynne empties itself into the sea near by.

8992,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"It is, indeed, a pleasant place. At the time of this story all the"

9002,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9003,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,The girl took no notice of this discourse. It was no new thing for her
9004,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"to hear grumbling from her brother, and she was accustomed to bear it"
9005,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"without murmur or dissent. Presently she ran away, along the river"
9006,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"bank, with her doll, to a shady place, where she knew the sun was not"
9007,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"strong, and where some rushes overhung the path. There she could put"
9008,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,her doll to sleep. It was no use asking Archie to join her. He was too
9009,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,old and too much of a man to enter into any such stupidity.
9010,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9011,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Presently Archie sat down in the shade, on the balustrades of the"
9012,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,churchyard and watched the glee of the High-Schoolboys with a sulky
9013,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,envy.
9014,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9015,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"It was a glorious summer afternoon. The sky overhead was one vast,"

9024,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9025,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Then he paused in his musings and thought of all the injustice done to
9026,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"him by his mother. He thought, like all gloomy, wretched little boys,"
9027,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"of all that was ill. He didn't for one moment remember, how, that very"
9028,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"morning, the self-same, unjust mother, after packing up his little"
9029,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"lunch-basket, had put her arms round his neck, and a little"
9030,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"red-cheeked apple in his pocket, and told him to keep away from the"
9031,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"river. Oh, no, he seemed to have quite forgotten all that."
9032,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9033,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Then the sun went behind a cloud and Archie felt the cool wind, which"
9034,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"blew from the cove, on his cheek, so he jumped down from his musing"
9035,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,place and sped away as fast as his legs would carry him toward the
9036,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"house of the boat-builder. He ran across the green, down the grassy"
9037,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"slopes and across a stretch of shingly beach, to the cottage of his"
9038,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,friend.
9039,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9040,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Ben Huntly, the boat-builder, was a good-hearted fellow, and was"
9041,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,extremely fond of all the children of the village. He had that method
9042,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,possessed by few people of searching into the heart of a child and
9043,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,arguing with him in a manner suitable for a child's understanding.
9044,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9045,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Archie had often sought Ben's counsel when things seemed to go wrong,"
9046,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,and it was seldom that the boat-builder had failed to convince the
9047,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"boy, even to his satisfaction, that he was wrong."
9048,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9049,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"It was an off day for the boat-builder. He was sitting, smoking his"
9050,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"pipe, in the cottage porch, and reading a well-thumbed copy of ""Gray's"
9051,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Master Mariner."" He welcomed Archie with a secret delight, for he"
9052,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"knew, by his little friend's face, that he was brooding over some"
9053,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"fancied injury, and it gave the boat-builder pleasure to talk his"

9055,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9056,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"""Well, Archie, what's new in the wind,"" said Ben, as he greeted the"

9058,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"my boy."""
9059,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9060,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Little Archie sat down on a large stone bench in the porch, and told"
9061,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Ben his story. His mother had been vexed with him that morning. She
9062,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"had asked him to call at the rectory with a message for Doctor Hart,"
9063,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"and he wanted to cut grass at the time, and objected. His mother did"
9064,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"not scold him, oh, no, Ben, she sent Carrie, who willingly took the"
9065,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"message, and his father had called him a name. Then, again, he had no"
9066,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,toys like other boys. Some had a pony; he couldn't have one. His
9067,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,father always answered his request for a pony with the reply that he
9068,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,couldn't afford one just then and he would see about it some day. If
9069,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Ben would only tell him how to go to sea he would certainly run away

9073,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9074,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Now, Ben knew the character of little Archie better, perhaps, than his"
9075,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"own mother did; so, when he had given the little boy a draught of cool"
9076,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"milk from the cottage kitchen, Ben lit his pipe afresh, and took down"
9077,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"an old telescope, a relic of his sea-faring days, from the wall. The"
9078,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"young man and the boy then strolled across a low, level tract of sand,"
9079,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"to a grassy hillock, formed by the current of the Wyncombe. Here they"
9080,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"sat down in the fast waning twilight, and discussed little Archie's"
9081,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,purposed flight.
9082,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9083,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"""Yes, Archie,"" said Ben, ""a sailor's life is well enough, if you don't"
9084,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,mind hard beds and harder words. If you can eat salty meat and mouldy
9085,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"bread it's a fine life, Archie. There is no life I'd like better if"
9086,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"they'd give you fresher water and not quite so many cruel blows. But,"
9087,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"if you've made up your mind, Archie, and think you can go to bed"
9088,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"nights in a rolling, tossing sea, with the wind howling and the rain"
9089,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"pouring, and your mother thousands of miles away, looking at your"
9090,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"little empty bed, I should think very seriously about it."" Archie"
9091,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"looked thoughtful, as the gloom deepened on his face, and silence fell"
9092,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,on the pair for a time.
9093,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9094,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,[Illustration: ARCHIE THINKING OF BEN'S STORY.]
9095,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9096,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Suddenly Ben spied a French frigate looming against the darkening sky
9097,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,and showed it to Archie through the telescope. He explained all the
9098,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,parts of the ship and dwelt long in his answers to the lad's
9099,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"questions. He told little Archie how, early one stormy morning, he had"
9100,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,been awakened from his bed in the cottage by the sound of guns away at
9101,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"sea, how he had descended to the beach with a lot of the villagers, to"
9102,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,find the waves beating mercilessly over a great broken ship. He told
9103,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"how they had all stood, in the leaden morning, stricken with dread at"
9104,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,the sight of the disaster they were all powerless to prevent; leaning
9105,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"hard against the wind, their breath and vision often failing as the"
9106,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,sleet and spray rushed at them from the great mountain of foaming sea
9107,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"which kept breaking on the rocks in the cove. He told farther, how,"
9108,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"before all their eyes, the vessel had given one great heave backwards"
9109,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,and sank beneath the waves forever; how they could faintly hear the
9110,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,heart-rending screams of women and children above the storm as the
9111,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,great waste of waters covered the struggling vessel. He told Archie
9112,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"that, on the following evening, while he was mending a boat down the"
9113,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"bay, he came across something lying amongst a mass of sea-weed, and on"
9114,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"turning it over had found it to be the dead body of a sailor--a fair,"
9115,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,curly-headed youth.
9116,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9117,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"""He was clad,"" said Ben, ""in a pair of linen trowsers and a sea shirt,"
9118,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,and the weeds and sand were all tangled in his hair. I raised him up
9119,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,from the beach and a small bundle fell out of his bosom. I laid him in
9120,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,my boat and went for Doctor Hart. It was the talk of the village for
9121,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,days. Dr. Hart found the bundle to contain a packet of letters written
9122,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,in a feeble hand and signed by the dead sailor's mother. They were
9123,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"loving letters of expected joy at her boy's return."""
9124,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9125,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Ben would have gone on with the story, but he was attracted by the"
9126,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"appearance of Archie. The little lad was sitting, with his pale face"
9127,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"turned up to Ben, and with two great tears, as large as horse beans,"
9128,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,in the corners of his eyes. On meeting Ben's gaze he broke down
9129,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"thoroughly and burst into a flood of tears, throwing his arms round"
9130,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"the honest boat-builder's neck, sobbing on his breast."
9131,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9132,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"""Oh, Ben, I don't want to leave mother; I am a wicked boy. If she were"
9133,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"to die, Ben, what should I do? Do you think she is alive now, Ben? I"
9134,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"don't want to go away, Ben."""
9135,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9136,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,The boat-builder soothed the little lad and smiled at the success of
9137,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,his purpose to divert the boy's mind.
9138,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9139,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"It was now nearly night, and time for Archie to go home, so Ben took"
9140,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"him on his shoulders and carried him to Mr. Archer's house, where the"
9141,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,family were all waiting supper for the little boy.
9142,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9143,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,Archie ran to his mother as soon as he got in and kissed her over and
9144,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"over again. He told her his little story, making the good woman's"
9145,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,heart overflow with love for her little son.
9146,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,
9147,BY C. MANNERS SMITH.,"Ben stayed to supper with the family that night, and all was bright"

9264,BY RUTH LAMB.,sample of such.
9265,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9266,BY RUTH LAMB.,"When she spoke of having been left ""comfortable"" by her deceased"
9267,BY RUTH LAMB.,"partner, there was a look of triumph and satisfaction on her face, and"
9268,BY RUTH LAMB.,"a ""No-thanks-to-any-of-you"" kind of tone in her voice, that must have"
9269,BY RUTH LAMB.,jarred on the ear of a listener.
9270,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9271,BY RUTH LAMB.,"No one ever saw a tear in Mrs. Crook's eye, or heard an expression of"
9272,BY RUTH LAMB.,"regret for the loss of ""Crook"" himself. He had been dead and out of"
9273,BY RUTH LAMB.,sight and mind almost these ten years past. He was merely remembered
9274,BY RUTH LAMB.,"as having done his duty in leaving his widow ""comfortable."" People"
9275,BY RUTH LAMB.,were left to speculate as they chose about the amount represented by
9276,BY RUTH LAMB.,the expression. It would not have been good for the man or woman who
9277,BY RUTH LAMB.,"had ventured to ask a direct question on the subject, but everybody"
9278,BY RUTH LAMB.,agreed that Mrs. Crook must have something handsome. Surely
9279,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""comfortable"" means free from care, both as regards to-day and"
9280,BY RUTH LAMB.,"to-morrow: not only enough, but a little more, or else anxiety might"
9281,BY RUTH LAMB.,"step in and spoil comfort. If Mrs. Crook had more than enough, she"
9282,BY RUTH LAMB.,"took care not to give of her abundance. Neither man, woman nor child"
9283,BY RUTH LAMB.,"was ever the better for the surplus, if such there were. One of her"
9284,BY RUTH LAMB.,"favorite expressions was, ""I don't care for much neighboring; I prefer"
9285,BY RUTH LAMB.,"keeping myself to myself."""
9286,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9287,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""And you keep every thing else to yourself,"" muttered one who had"
9288,BY RUTH LAMB.,vainly tried to enlist her sympathy for another who was in sickness
9289,BY RUTH LAMB.,and trouble.
9290,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9291,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Mrs. Crook had a pretty garden, well-stocked with flowers, according"
9292,BY RUTH LAMB.,"to the season. She was fond of working in it, and might be seen there"
9293,BY RUTH LAMB.,"daily, with her sun-bonnet on, snipping, tying and tending her plants."
9294,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9295,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Children do so love flowers, and, thank God, those who live in country"
9296,BY RUTH LAMB.,"places have grand gardens to roam in, free to all, and planted by His"
9297,BY RUTH LAMB.,"own loving hand. But in town it is different, and Mrs. Crook lived"
9298,BY RUTH LAMB.,just outside one; far enough away from its smoke to allow of
9299,BY RUTH LAMB.,"successful gardening, not too far to prevent little feet from"
9300,BY RUTH LAMB.,"wandering thither from narrow courts and alleys, to breathe a purer"
9301,BY RUTH LAMB.,"air, and gaze, with longing eyes, at the fair blossoms. It always"
9302,BY RUTH LAMB.,"irritated Mrs. Crook to see these dirty, unkempt little creatures"
9303,BY RUTH LAMB.,"clustering around her gate, or peeping through her hedge."
9304,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9305,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""What do you want here?"" she would ask, sharply. ""Get away with you,"
9306,BY RUTH LAMB.,or I will send for a policeman. You are peeping about to see if you
9307,BY RUTH LAMB.,"can pick up something; I know you are. Be off, without any more"
9308,BY RUTH LAMB.,"telling!"""
9309,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9310,BY RUTH LAMB.,The light of pleasure called into the young eyes by the sight of the
9311,BY RUTH LAMB.,"flowers would fade away, and the hopeful look leave the dirty faces,"
9312,BY RUTH LAMB.,as Mrs. Crook's harsh words fell on the children's ears. But as they
9313,BY RUTH LAMB.,"turned away with unwilling, lingering steps, heads would be stretched,"
9314,BY RUTH LAMB.,"and a wistful, longing gaze cast upon the coveted flowers, until they"
9315,BY RUTH LAMB.,were quite lost to sight.
9316,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9317,BY RUTH LAMB.,There was a tradition amongst the youngsters that a very small child
9318,BY RUTH LAMB.,"had once called, through the bars of the gate: ""P'ease, Missis, do"
9319,BY RUTH LAMB.,"give me a f'ower."" Also that something in the baby voice had so far"
9320,BY RUTH LAMB.,"moved Mrs. Jemima Crook, that she had stooped to select one or two of"
9321,BY RUTH LAMB.,"the least faded roses among all those just snipped from the bushes,"
9322,BY RUTH LAMB.,"and given them to the daring little blue eyes outside, with this"
9323,BY RUTH LAMB.,"injunction, however:"
9324,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9325,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""Mind you never come here asking for flowers any more."""
9326,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9327,BY RUTH LAMB.,"This report was long current among the inhabitants of a city court,"
9328,BY RUTH LAMB.,but it needs confirmation.
9329,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9330,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Mrs. Crook objected to borrowers also, and perhaps she was not so much"
9331,BY RUTH LAMB.,"to be blamed for that. Most of us who possess bookshelves, and once"
9332,BY RUTH LAMB.,"delighted in seeing them well filled, look sorrowfully at gaps made by"
9333,BY RUTH LAMB.,borrowers who have failed to return our treasures. But domestic
9334,BY RUTH LAMB.,"emergencies occur even in the best regulated families, and neighborly"
9335,BY RUTH LAMB.,help may be imperatively required. It may be a matter of Christian
9336,BY RUTH LAMB.,"duty and privilege too, to lend both our goods and our personal aid."
9337,BY RUTH LAMB.,Mrs. Crook did not think so. Lending formed no part of her creed. If
9338,BY RUTH LAMB.,"other people believed in it, and liked their household goods to travel"
9339,BY RUTH LAMB.,"up and down the neighborhood, that was their look-out, not hers."
9340,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9341,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""I never borrow, so why should I lend?"" asked Mrs. Crook. ""Besides, I"
9342,BY RUTH LAMB.,am particular about my things. My pans are kept as bright and clean as
9343,BY RUTH LAMB.,"new ones, and if my servant put them on the shelves, as some people's"
9344,BY RUTH LAMB.,"servants replace theirs after using, she would not be here long. No,"
9345,BY RUTH LAMB.,"thank you. When I begin to borrow, I will begin to lend, but not until"
9346,BY RUTH LAMB.,"then."""
9347,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9348,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Mrs. Crook's sentiments were so well known that, even in a case of"
9349,BY RUTH LAMB.,"sickness, when a few spoonfuls of mustard were needed for immediate"
9350,BY RUTH LAMB.,"use in poultices, the messenger on the way to borrow it, passed her"
9351,BY RUTH LAMB.,"door rather than risk a refusal, whereby more time might be lost than"
9352,BY RUTH LAMB.,by going farther in the first instance.
9353,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9354,BY RUTH LAMB.,Many were the invitations Mrs. Crook received to take part in the work
9355,BY RUTH LAMB.,of different societies. One lady asked her to join the Dorcas meeting.
9356,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9357,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""You can sew so beautifully,"" she said. ""You would be a great"
9358,BY RUTH LAMB.,"acquisition to our little gathering."""
9359,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9360,BY RUTH LAMB.,The compliment touched a tender point. Mrs. Crook was proud of her
9361,BY RUTH LAMB.,"needlework, but to dedicate such skill in sewing to making"
9362,BY RUTH LAMB.,under-clothing for the poorest of the poor: The idea was monstrous!
9363,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9364,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Mrs. Crook answered civilly, that she could not undertake to go"
9365,BY RUTH LAMB.,backwards and forwards to a room half a mile off. It would be a waste
9366,BY RUTH LAMB.,"of time. Besides, though it was probably not the case in that"
9367,BY RUTH LAMB.,"particular meeting, she had heard that there was often a great deal of"
9368,BY RUTH LAMB.,gossip going on at such places. The visitor was determined not to be
9369,BY RUTH LAMB.,"offended, and she replied, gently, that there was no chance of gossip,"
9370,BY RUTH LAMB.,"for, after a certain time had been given to the actual business of the"
9371,BY RUTH LAMB.,"meeting, such as planning, cutting out, and apportioning work, one of"
9372,BY RUTH LAMB.,"the ladies read, whilst the rest sewed. ""But,"" she added, ""if you are"
9373,BY RUTH LAMB.,"willing to help us a little, and object to joining the meeting at the"
9374,BY RUTH LAMB.,"room, perhaps you would let me bring you something to be made at home."
9375,BY RUTH LAMB.,"There is always work for every willing hand."""
9376,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9377,BY RUTH LAMB.,Then Mrs. Crook drew herself up and said she did not feel inclined to
9378,BY RUTH LAMB.,"take in sewing. She had her own to do, and did it without requiring"
9379,BY RUTH LAMB.,"assistance, and she thought it was better to teach the lower classes"
9380,BY RUTH LAMB.,to depend upon themselves than to go about pampering poor people and
9381,BY RUTH LAMB.,"encouraging idleness, as many persons were so fond of doing"
9382,BY RUTH LAMB.,"now-a-days. No doubt they thought they were doing good, but, for her"
9383,BY RUTH LAMB.,"part, she believed that in many cases they did harm."
9384,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9385,BY RUTH LAMB.,"The visitor could have told tales of worn-out toilers, laboring almost"
9386,BY RUTH LAMB.,"night and day to win bread for their children, but unable to find"
9387,BY RUTH LAMB.,either material for a garment or time to make it. She could have
9388,BY RUTH LAMB.,"pleaded for the widow and the orphan, if there had seemed any feelings"
9389,BY RUTH LAMB.,"to touch, any heart to stir. But Mrs. Crook's hard words and looks"
9390,BY RUTH LAMB.,"repelled her, and she went her way, after a mere ""Good-morning. I am"
9391,BY RUTH LAMB.,"sorry you cannot see your way to help us."""
9392,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9393,BY RUTH LAMB.,"No chance of widows weeping for the loss of Mrs. Crook, or telling of"
9394,BY RUTH LAMB.,"her almsdeeds and good works, or showing the coats and garments made"
9395,BY RUTH LAMB.,for them by her active fingers!
9396,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9397,BY RUTH LAMB.,It was the same when some adventurous collector called upon Mrs. Crook
9398,BY RUTH LAMB.,to solicit a subscription. She had always something to say against the
9399,BY RUTH LAMB.,object for which money was asked. If it were for the sufferers by an
9400,BY RUTH LAMB.,accident in a coal mine or for the unemployed at a time of trade
9401,BY RUTH LAMB.,depression:
9402,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9403,BY RUTH LAMB.,"""Why don't they insure their lives like their betters? Why don't they"
9404,BY RUTH LAMB.,"save something, when they are getting good wages? I am not going to"
9405,BY RUTH LAMB.,"encourage the thriftless, or help those who might help themselves, if"
9406,BY RUTH LAMB.,"they would think beforehand."""
9407,BY RUTH LAMB.,
9408,BY RUTH LAMB.,"At length every one gave up trying to enlist her services, or to"
9409,BY RUTH LAMB.,"obtain contributions from her, for the support of any good cause. And"
9410,BY RUTH LAMB.,"Mrs. Crook bestowed all her thoughts, her affections, her time and her"
9411,BY RUTH LAMB.,"means, on the only person she thought worthy of them all--namely Mrs."
9412,BY RUTH LAMB.,Crook herself.

9982,MAY R. BALDWIN.,There is a class of workers in India who have always held to
9983,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"needlework, useful and ornamental, through the changes of the long"
9984,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"years, and have never had the help of machines."
9985,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
9986,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"These workers are ""Tailor Birds."" Specimens of their handiwork have"
9987,MAY R. BALDWIN.,excited the admiration of many travelers in the country where they are

9989,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
9990,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"Their needlework is seen in the construction of their nests, which"
9991,MAY R. BALDWIN.,vary in size and appearance.
9992,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
9993,MAY R. BALDWIN.,The beak of the bird answers for a needle; and for thread--and this is
9994,MAY R. BALDWIN.,the wonderful thing about sewing--they use the silken spiders' webs.
9995,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"These threads are made secure by fastening them with silken buttons,"
9996,MAY R. BALDWIN.,made by twisting the ends. Think of that! spiders' webs for thread!
9997,MAY R. BALDWIN.,How marvelous would the work of the fair ladies all over the land
9998,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"seem, if the door screens and the window hangings and the dresses and"
9999,MAY R. BALDWIN.,the laces were decorated with designs worked with spider's web thread!
10000,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
10001,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"Sometimes, it is true, these birds use the silk from cocoons for their"
10002,MAY R. BALDWIN.,work; and even such common material as bits of thread and wool are
10003,MAY R. BALDWIN.,used. One traveler states that he has seen a bird watch a native
10004,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"tailor as he sewed under a covered veranda; and, when he had left his"
10005,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"work for a while, the watchful bird flew to the place, gathered some"
10006,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"of the threads quickly, and then flew away with his unlawful prize to"
10007,MAY R. BALDWIN.,use it in sewing together leaves for his nest.
10008,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
10009,MAY R. BALDWIN.,Imagine one of these bird homes. Could any thing be more fairy-like?
10010,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"The leaves are joined, of course, to the tree by their own natural"
10011,MAY R. BALDWIN.,fastenings. But who taught the first bird home-maker how to bring the
10012,MAY R. BALDWIN.,leaves together? And who gave the first lessons in sewing? And how did
10013,MAY R. BALDWIN.,it come to choose its delicate spider web thread and twist it into
10014,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"strength, and fasten it with silken buttons?"
10015,MAY R. BALDWIN.,
10016,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"The great art leader, John Ruskin, who has written so many books to"
10017,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"teach people that all beautiful things have their use, and that things"
10018,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"that are not truthful can never be beautiful, would say, I think, that"
10019,MAY R. BALDWIN.,the workmanship upon the tailor bird's nest exactly fitted his idea of
10020,MAY R. BALDWIN.,"the ""true and the beautiful,"" because there is no ornament which has"
10021,MAY R. BALDWIN.,not its use. The silk buttons are not placed there for show; they

10081,THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME.,"Samuel Appleton, a distinguished Boston merchant, was once sued for a"
10082,THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME.,"note, found among the papers of a deceased merchant tailor, and signed"
10083,THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME.,"with his name. The handwriting was exactly like his own, but he"
10084,THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME.,"declared it to be a forgery, albeit his own brother said he could not"
10085,THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME.,"positively say it was not Mr. Appleton's writing, though he believed"

10104,DINGFORD'S BABY.,That little brother of Hetty Dingford was the funniest baby on the
10105,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"coast; and there were a good many of them, right around the river"

10107,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10108,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"Flora thought so too, or rather she looked upon him in the light of a"
10109,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"puppy, as she had just raised a small family herself, and the baby had"
10110,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"associated so much with the little dogs, that she thought she owned"
10111,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"him too. She seemed to regard him as her especial charge, and used to"
10112,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"rush between him and cattle on the roads, and bark away strollers from"
10113,DINGFORD'S BABY.,the door-yard; but she seemed to love it most on the beach.
10114,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10115,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"Whenever she thought of it, she would leave the other children, in"
10116,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"whose charge the baby had been placed, and rush up to the little one,"
10117,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"and lick its face all over, and bark with a very funny sound. The baby"
10118,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"would pick up a handful of gravel and throw it at the dog, but it"
10119,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"never hit him, and then they would both laugh together."
10120,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10121,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"One afternoon, Tony Dingford said he was going a crabbing, and then"
10122,DINGFORD'S BABY.,Hetty and Polly and Janey and the baby all wanted to go and see him
10123,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"off. Janey took a lovely little boat, that had been made for her by"
10124,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"her uncle, and Polly took her spade and pail to dig for shells. Hetty"
10125,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"took the baby, and she had to carry him every step of the way, and she"
10126,DINGFORD'S BABY.,was only eight years old; he was a year and a half old and couldn't
10127,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"walk very steady, but he could creep. Oh, how he could get over the"
10128,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"ground! He could go sidewise and backwards, like a crab, Tony said. He"
10129,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"thought he could talk, too, and such a lot of curious sounds as he"
10130,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"used to make. He looked very odd, winking his eyes and sticking his"
10131,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"tongue between his four little teeth, and he was up to all sorts of"
10132,DINGFORD'S BABY.,tricks.
10133,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10134,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"After awhile they came to the beach, right opposite the light-house--a"
10135,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"most delightful spot, and Hetty proceeded to deposit the baby on the"
10136,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"ground, when he came to the conclusion that he didn't want to be put"
10137,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"there, and he caught hold of her curly locks and held on for dear"
10138,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"life, and screamed like a sea-gull."
10139,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10140,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"This made Hetty cry out, but nothing could induce that baby to let go,"
10141,DINGFORD'S BABY.,until a pail with some shells changed the current of his thoughts.
10142,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"Hetty jumped away, and ran with the children, a few steps, to see"
10143,DINGFORD'S BABY.,Tony's boat.
10144,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10145,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"He threw in his basket and crabbing net and then, getting in himself,"
10146,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"he pulled out into the bay. The children wandered along, watching Tony"
10147,DINGFORD'S BABY.,as he grew a lessening speck out in the sunshine. It was such fun to
10148,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"jump on the stones, over the water; the shells looked more beautiful"
10149,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"here, because they were wet."
10150,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10151,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"They staid longer than they thought, and on going back, they found the"
10152,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"pail and the shells, but no baby! They called, they looked about, but"
10153,DINGFORD'S BABY.,the baby was gone! Every one of them cried bitter tears; they searched
10154,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"behind rocks and under bushes; his little pink, spotted cap could not"
10155,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"be seen, but the marks of his hands and feet showed plainly in the"
10156,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"sand, and they led down to the water!"
10157,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10158,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"""Oh, baby,"" said Hetty in her agony, ""you may pull out all my hair if"
10159,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"you like--where are you?"""
10160,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10161,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"""Oo may whack my boat all to pieces, baby--come back to Janey!"" said"
10162,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"her sister. No sound answered, and the gulls sailed over them, and the"
10163,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"blue waters lapped the stones. The tide was rising, as it was past the"
10164,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"middle of the afternoon. Nothing was to be done, but to carry the"
10165,DINGFORD'S BABY.,dreadful news to mother.
10166,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10167,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"As the children approached the cottage, they saw their father"
10168,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"returning with the dog, Flora, and as the father caught sight of them"
10169,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"he saw that something had happened. Hetty approached, and, with"
10170,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"heart-broken sobs, told her story. The mother cried and wrung her"
10171,DINGFORD'S BABY.,hands.
10172,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10173,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"""Husband, he's drowned! he's drowned!"" she cried. The father brushed"
10174,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"his hand roughly across his eyes, for the tears would come; and the"
10175,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"dog staring from one to the other, looked painfully alert and"
10176,DINGFORD'S BABY.,interested.
10177,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10178,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"""I'll go to the beach and search all night; maybe he'll be washed up"

10180,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10181,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"""Father,"" said the weeping wife, ""maybe he has not been drowned; oh,"

10183,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"baby."""
10184,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10185,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"The father looked at the dog, which seemed to understand every word,"
10186,DINGFORD'S BABY.,and went into the house and picked up a little Indian moccasin that
10187,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"the child had worn, and calling Flora, gave it to her. She looked at"
10188,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"it, smelled of it, and throwing her nose into the air, rushed toward"
10189,DINGFORD'S BABY.,the beach.
10190,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10191,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"The short, sharp barks of the dog guided them to the different spots"
10192,DINGFORD'S BABY.,to which the child had crept. But he was not found. The dog bounded
10193,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"away again, this time in the direction of some holes that had been"
10194,DINGFORD'S BABY.,worn in the face of the rocks by the tides. The water was fast coming
10195,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"up to them, and they would be entirely filled before the tide turned."
10196,DINGFORD'S BABY.,The despairing mother was about returning with her children when the
10197,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"father caught a distant sound, a joyful barking that Flora always made"
10198,DINGFORD'S BABY.,when she had been successful in a hunt. He bounded over the rocks that
10199,DINGFORD'S BABY.,were bathed in the red light of the setting sun. He found Flora
10200,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"barking and wagging her tail, at the mouth of the first little cavern;"
10201,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"he stooped and looked in, and there on the white sand lay the baby,"
10202,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"asleep. Its little cap was gone, and it dress torn and soiled with"
10203,DINGFORD'S BABY.,seaweed.
10204,DINGFORD'S BABY.,
10205,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"The father reached for his little treasure, and hugged him to his"
10206,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"heart. The baby laughed, and made most frantic efforts to talk, and"
10207,DINGFORD'S BABY.,immediately twisted both hands tight in his father's hair. This was
10208,DINGFORD'S BABY.,"the baby's way, you know, when he wanted to be carried. You would have"

10470,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"These plants are so constructed as to attract insects, capture them in"
10471,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"various ways, and feed upon them. Perhaps the best known of the group"
10472,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"is _Venus' Fly-Trap_. The leaves vary from one to six inches long, and"
10473,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"at the extremities are placed two blades, or claspers. On the inner"
10474,PLANTS THAT EAT.,walls of these claspers are placed six irritable hairs; the slightest
10475,PLANTS THAT EAT.,touch from an insect on any one of which is sufficient to bring the
10476,PLANTS THAT EAT.,two blades together with such rapidity as to preclude any possibility
10477,PLANTS THAT EAT.,of the fly escaping.

10479,PLANTS THAT EAT.,[Illustration: LEAVES OF THE FLY-TRAP OPENED AND CLOSED.]
10480,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10481,PLANTS THAT EAT.,This plant readily discriminates between animal and other matter;
10482,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"thus, if a small stone or piece of wood be dropped into the trap, it"
10483,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"will instantly close, but as soon as it has found out its mistake--and"
10484,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"it only takes a few minutes--it begins to unfold its trap, and the"
10485,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"piece of wood or stone falls out. On the other hand, should a piece of"
10486,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"beef or a bluebottle fly be placed in it, it will remain firmly closed"
10487,PLANTS THAT EAT.,until all the matter is absorbed through the leaf. It will then unfold
10488,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"itself, and is ready for another meal."

10492,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"Another species is called the _Vegetable Whiskey Shop_, as it captures"
10493,PLANTS THAT EAT.,its victims by intoxication. The entire shop is shaped after the
10494,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"manner of a house, with the entrance projecting a little over the rim."
10495,PLANTS THAT EAT.,Half-way round the brim of the cavity there are an immense number of
10496,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"honey glands, which the influence of the sun brings into active"
10497,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"operation. This sweet acts as a lure to passing insects, and they are"
10498,PLANTS THAT EAT.,sure to alight on the outside edge and tap the nectar.
10499,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10500,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"They, however, remain there but a brief period, as there is something"
10501,PLANTS THAT EAT.,more substantial inside the cavity in the shape of an intoxicating
10502,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"liquid, which is distilled by the plant. The way down to this beverage"
10503,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"is straight, as the entrance is paved with innumerable fine hairs, all"
10504,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"pointing to the bottom, and should the fly walk crooked its feet"
10505,PLANTS THAT EAT.,become entangled in them.

10509,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"When the fly has had its first sip, it does not stop and fly right"
10510,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"out, as it could do, but it indulges until it comes staggering up and"
10511,PLANTS THAT EAT.,reaches that portion where the hairs begin; here its progress outward
10512,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"is stopped, owing to the points of the hairs being placed against it."
10513,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"The fly is now in a pitiable plight; it attempts to use its wings, but"
10514,PLANTS THAT EAT.,in doing so only hasten its destruction. It inevitably gets immersed
10515,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"in the liquid, and dies drunk."
10516,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10517,PLANTS THAT EAT.,_Australian Pitcher Plant_ is a beautiful little object. Its pitchers
10518,PLANTS THAT EAT.,are at the bottom of the principal stem of the plant.
10519,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10520,PLANTS THAT EAT.,One species distils an intoxicant of its own; but owing to its small
10521,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"orifice, it excludes the majority of insects, and admits but a select"
10522,PLANTS THAT EAT.,few. The individual pitchers somewhat resemble an inverted parrot's
10523,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"bill, with a narrow leaf-like expansion running along the top. The"
10524,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"color is light green, beautifully shaded with crimson. The inside of"
10525,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"the pitcher is divided into three parts: The first, nearest the"
10526,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"entrance, is studded with minute honey glands, and is called the"
10527,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"attractive surface; a little farther down the inside, very minute"
10528,PLANTS THAT EAT.,hairs are situated with their extremities all pointing to the other
10529,PLANTS THAT EAT.,chamber. This is the conducting surface.
10530,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10531,PLANTS THAT EAT.,[Illustration: THE PITCHER PLANT OF MADAGASCAR.]
10532,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10533,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"Lastly, the small hairs give place to the longer ones, amid which are"
10534,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"placed secreting pores, which give forth the intoxicating nectar. This"
10535,PLANTS THAT EAT.,is termed the detentive surface. When the pitcher has caught a
10536,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"sufficient number of insects, the nectar gives place to a substance"
10537,PLANTS THAT EAT.,which enables the plant more readily to digest its food.
10538,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10539,PLANTS THAT EAT.,Another variety is the _Mosquito Catcher_. It grows about one foot
10540,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"high, and the leaves, after reaching a certain height, divide into"
10541,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"long, narrow spathes, covered with hairs, each coated with a bright"
10542,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"gummy substance. This, during sunshine, gives to the plant a most"
10543,PLANTS THAT EAT.,magnificent appearance. If a plant be placed in a room where
10544,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"mosquitoes abound, all the troublesome pests will in a brief period be"
10545,PLANTS THAT EAT.,in its steady embrace.
10546,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10547,PLANTS THAT EAT.,It is most interesting to watch the method by which it secures its
10548,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"prey. Immediately the fly alights on the leaf, it may be that only"
10549,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"one of its six legs stick to the sweet, viscid substance at the"
10550,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"extremity of the hairs; but in struggling to free itself, it"
10551,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"invariably touches with its legs or wings the contiguous hairs, and is"
10552,PLANTS THAT EAT.,immediately fixed.
10553,PLANTS THAT EAT.,
10554,PLANTS THAT EAT.,These little hairs meantime are not idle; they slowly but surely curl
10555,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"round and draw their victim into the very center of the leaf, thus"
10556,PLANTS THAT EAT.,"bringing it into contact with the very short hairs, which are placed"
10557,PLANTS THAT EAT.,there in order to facilitate the process of sucking the life-blood
10558,PLANTS THAT EAT.,from the body.

10618,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"She was only five years old, hardly that, but a stout, healthy little"
10619,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"creature, full of love and fun, but often hard to manage."
10620,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10621,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"Maggie was her name, but she would call herself nothing but ""Davy's"
10622,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"girl."""
10623,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10624,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"Davy, her brother, a brave, good boy, about fifteen years of age, was"
10625,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"all she had to cling to, and she was his only treasure. They were"
10626,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"orphans; their father had been drowned, with many other poor"
10627,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"fishermen, when Maggie was a wee baby, and the mother, soon after,"
10628,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"died, from worry and hard work."
10629,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10630,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"So these two were all alone in the world, but they did not feel"
10631,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"lonely, for each one was all the world to the other."
10632,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10633,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"They lived with an old fisherman and his wife, on the shores of the"
10634,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"ocean, in New Jersey; and in the inlets and about outside, Davy used"
10635,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"to go with the men, in the boats, and help them fish; sometimes he"
10636,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"would work in-shore, for the truck farmers; sometimes help to gather"
10637,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,the salt hay from the marshes. He would work hard at any thing so as
10638,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,to make money to keep his little sister comfortable and to give her
10639,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,all it was well for her to have.
10640,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10641,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"In winter he would tramp through cold and snow and storms, several"
10642,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"miles, to the little town where the school was, and so, every year, he"
10643,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,gained a few weeks of instruction.
10644,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10645,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"The people among whom these orphans lived were rough, but"
10646,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"kind-hearted, and Davy always had enough work to enable him to earn"
10647,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,money sufficient to keep Maggie and himself in the simple way in which
10648,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,every body about them lived.
10649,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10650,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"Whenever he had an idle half-day, or even a few hours, he would take"
10651,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"the little girl and his books, and go down to the shore, and getting"
10652,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"into one of the boats always to be found drawn up on the sand, he"
10653,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"would study hard to learn, for he was anxious to get on in the world,"
10654,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"not only for his own, but his sister's sake, and Maggie would take one"
10655,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"of the books, and open it, and run her little fat finger over the"
10656,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"page, and move her lips, and make believe that she, too, was studying"
10657,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"her lessons and she would keep still as a little mouse, until, after a"
10658,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"few minutes of nodding, her eyes would close, then her head would drop"
10659,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"on Davy's knee, and she would be off--sound asleep, until it was time"
10660,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,for him to go.
10661,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10662,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"It happened, one afternoon, as Davy, with Maggie, was going to the"
10663,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"boat, which was his favorite place of study, a farmer drove along and"
10664,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,asked him if he could not go and help with some work.
10665,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10666,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"They were very near home yet, and when Davy said, ""Maggie, will you"
10667,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"run right home?"" she answered, ""'Es;"" so the brother saw her start off"
10668,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"towards the house, which was in sight, then jumped in beside the"
10669,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"farmer, and they drove off."
10670,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10671,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"It was several hours before the boy returned. He went directly home,"
10672,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"and as soon as he entered, called, ""Maggie!"""
10673,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10674,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"""Maggie aint here,"" said Mrs. Baker, who was busy cleaning up the"
10675,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"floor, ""she hasn't been here since you took her out with you."""
10676,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10677,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"If ever there was a frightened boy, it was Davy, then. He knew how"
10678,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"careless his little sister was, and how she loved to go down and"
10679,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"splash in the water, and play around the deep pools. He could look,"
10680,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"from the door, all along the beach and out on the sea, and there was"
10681,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"no sign of his little girl. Mrs. Baker was frightened, too, when he"
10682,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"told her all. They ran to the few houses about, and while some of the"
10683,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"children had seen Maggie, it was hours before; since then she had"
10684,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,disappeared entirely.
10685,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10686,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"It was a terrible blow to the poor boy, and he blamed himself as he"
10687,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,thought that perhaps his dear little sister was dead under the great
10688,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"waves, or her body was being washed away far beyond his reach. He ran"
10689,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"up and down, everywhere calling her name as loudly as he could, but"
10690,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,no answer came.
10691,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10692,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"Almost blind, with the tears in his eyes, he stood still for a moment"
10693,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"to think, when he caught sight of a little paper book. He knew it at"
10694,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,once; he had made it for Maggie so that she would not soil or tear his
10695,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,own. In a moment he was running as fast as his feet would carry him to
10696,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"the boat on the sand, a considerable distance off; quickly he reached"
10697,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"it, and climbed up the side. No Maggie yet."
10698,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10699,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"The great sail lay in a heap before him; he walked around it, and"
10700,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"there, all curled up, fast asleep, was his runaway girl."
10701,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10702,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"How his heart did jump for joy as he picked her up, and kissed and"
10703,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,petted her.
10704,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10705,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"But Maggie cried, and said he hurt her."
10706,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10707,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"Then he found that in climbing into the boat to ""study her lessons,"""
10708,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"she had sprained her ankle, and she had been very miserable all by"
10709,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"herself, and cried and called for him until she fell asleep."
10710,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,
10711,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"The books, all but one, were lying on the other side of the boat, on"
10712,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"the sand. Davy never minded them, precious as they were to him, but"
10713,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"taking his little sister on his strong back, he carried her home, her"
10714,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,arms about his neck and her cheek close to his; and Maggie had to stay
10715,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,"in the house, with her foot bandaged, for a week. But Davy never"
10716,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,forgot that fright nor left her to herself again until she was much
10717,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,older; and the little girl never thought of disobeying his orders
10718,ALEX. DUKE BAILIE.,after that. They had both learned a hard lesson.

10752,BONEY.,
10753,BONEY.,
10754,BONEY.,"Boney was not a thin cat by any means, as his name would suggest. He"
10755,BONEY.,was very stout for his age; this could be explained by the fact that
10756,BONEY.,"he had always looked out for number one, and had managed to secure a"
10757,BONEY.,great many nice things to eat in the course of his short life.
10758,BONEY.,
10759,BONEY.,"His coat, which was striped, gray and black, had an infinite number of"
10760,BONEY.,"shades in it and was so beautiful, that more than one lady wanted to"
10761,BONEY.,buy him.
10762,BONEY.,
10763,BONEY.,"Boney was not his whole name. A lovely romance could be written, I've"
10764,BONEY.,"no doubt, out of the adventures of this cat, before Fannie found him,"
10765,BONEY.,"one cold morning, in the summer-house. He was covered with dust and"
10766,BONEY.,"leaves, and moaning piteously. Fannie said,--""Pussy, pussy,"" to him;"
10767,BONEY.,"and he tried to get up and come to her, but he couldn't make any"
10768,BONEY.,"progress, and John Henry came up at that moment, and taking up the cat"
10769,BONEY.,"by the back of the neck, looked at it critically, and said,--""That cat"
10770,BONEY.,ain't a-going to die--he'll come out all right in a few days; he's
10771,BONEY.,been pelted with stones by those children that live at the
10772,BONEY.,"cross-roads, I think."""
10773,BONEY.,
10774,BONEY.,"Fannie followed her brother into the house with the cat, and he gave"
10775,BONEY.,"it some warm milk, and Fannie covered it up, snug, by the kitchen"
10776,BONEY.,stove.
10777,BONEY.,
10778,BONEY.,It was surprising how soon that pussy got well; and John Henry chose
10779,BONEY.,"to call him Boneset. The name took in the household, and though Fannie"
10780,BONEY.,"called him ""Boney,"" Boneset was his real name. John Henry bought him a"
10781,BONEY.,"collar, and Fannie would tie a beautiful scarlet ribbon on this, and"
10782,BONEY.,"away they'd go together, down the road to the village post-office."
10783,BONEY.,He'd look very sharply at the meadow-birds flitting over the stone
10784,BONEY.,"fences, and the yellow butterflies on the tall mullen stalks, as if he"
10785,BONEY.,"would say,--""I'll get you any of those you'd like to have, my dear"
10786,BONEY.,"mistress."""
10787,BONEY.,
10788,BONEY.,"But Fannie would say, ""Don't think of it, Boney; I would like to have"
10789,BONEY.,"them, but it would be wicked to catch them you know."" Pussy did not"
10790,BONEY.,"want to give up the sport of hunting them, however, and Fannie would"
10791,BONEY.,"have to take him right up, and carry him until they had passed them."
10792,BONEY.,
10793,BONEY.,He had such lovely coaxing ways; he knew to a minute when it was lunch
10794,BONEY.,"time, and he had his in the kitchen, but he would steal up into the"
10795,BONEY.,"dining-room, and pass round softly to Fannie's place, and pop up into"
10796,BONEY.,"her lap--or, if she were standing up, he'd get upon the table and rub"
10797,BONEY.,"his furry cheek against her shoulder, and shut one eye."
10798,BONEY.,
10799,BONEY.,"Then Fannie would turn round, and his comical appearance, sitting"
10800,BONEY.,"there with his little pink tongue sticking out between his lips, would"
10801,BONEY.,make Fannie just jump up and down with laughing.
10802,BONEY.,
10803,BONEY.,"Of course, he wanted some of Fannie's lunch, and he always got it, and"
10804,BONEY.,this was the way he managed to get so fat and sleek.
10805,BONEY.,
10806,BONEY.,"One unfortunate time, Fannie was very sick; the room was darkened, and"
10807,BONEY.,the doctor came. All the pets were not allowed to come near the room.
10808,BONEY.,
10809,BONEY.,"It was, oh, so lonesome for Boney. No one petted him like his little"
10810,BONEY.,"mistress, and they didn't put up with his tricks, or laugh at his"
10811,BONEY.,funny pranks.
10812,BONEY.,
10813,BONEY.,"The time went by heavily enough, he had not had on any of his ribbons,"
10814,BONEY.,"and he would go and stay away from home for days together, and when he"
10815,BONEY.,"came home just before dark, he had a wild look, as if he had been in"
10816,BONEY.,rough company.
10817,BONEY.,
10818,BONEY.,"On a lovely morning in June, Fannie was carried down stairs, to sit in"
10819,BONEY.,"the bay window, in the sunshine, and the ivy hung down its fresh,"
10820,BONEY.,green leaves.
10821,BONEY.,
10822,BONEY.,Boney saw her the first thing. His delight knew no bounds; he rubbed
10823,BONEY.,"his back against her chair, turned his head around in her robe as it"
10824,BONEY.,"lay on the carpet, and jumped into her lap! And Fannie smoothed his"
10825,BONEY.,back with her little thin hand.
10826,BONEY.,
10827,BONEY.,"After a time he went away, and nobody thought any thing about him,"
10828,BONEY.,"till dinner-time, when, what should they see coming up the piazza"
10829,BONEY.,"steps, but Boney, with a bobolink in his mouth! He walked right up to"
10830,BONEY.,"Fannie, and laid it down at her feet, and looked up at his little"
10831,BONEY.,"mistress, with such a satisfied, happy expression on his face, as if"
10832,BONEY.,"he would say,--""There, that's the best I could do, and you are welcome"
10833,BONEY.,"to it."""
10834,BONEY.,
10835,BONEY.,"Fannie understood his good intentions, and laughed heartily, and that"
10836,BONEY.,was the beginning of her recovery.
10837,BONEY.,
10838,BONEY.,"Pretty soon, she was able to go out again, and she and Boney had the"
10839,BONEY.,best of times that summer.

10881,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,
10882,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,"Jocko was hardly more than a baby monkey, but he was so full of"
10883,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,mischief that he often made his mother very sad. Jocko's father used
10884,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,to get angry with him; sometimes he used to give Jocko a good
10885,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,spanking; only he hadn't a slipper as the father of little boys have!
10886,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,Jocko's father and mother used to try to teach him that it was very
10887,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,bad manners to snatch any thing from the visitors who came up to the
10888,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,cage. That was a very hard lesson for Jocko to learn. One day he
10889,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,"snatched a pair of spectacles from an old lady, who was looking into"
10890,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,the cage and laughing; the old lady screamed with fright. Jocko tried
10891,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,to put the spectacles on himself; but the keeper made him give them
10892,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,"up. When the old lady got her glasses again, she didn't care to look"

10897,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,"going to die, and she was quite sure that some of his monkey cousins"
10898,A MISCHIEVOUS MONKEY.,"had hurt him. ""Not so,"" chattered Jocko's father, ""I found some pieces"

10942,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"how he made him earn money for him, and beat him because he was too"
10943,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,small to undertake the tasks which were set him. He told how he and
10944,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,some other boys had crept out of the slave-hut at night and found
10945,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"their way to English Mission House, because they had heard of the"
10946,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"white people, who were kind to the blacks."
10947,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,
10948,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"Then little Saat, for that was his name, made Lady Baker understand"
10949,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"how much he loved the white people, and how he wished to be her little"
10950,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"slave. She told him kindly that she needed no slave-boy, and that he"
10951,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"must go back to his rightful master. But little Saat said, ""No, he had"
10952,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"no master;"" and explained that the Missionaries had taught him a great"
10953,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"deal, and then sent him, with some other lads, to Egypt, to help in"
10954,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,the Mission work.
10955,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,
10956,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"Unfortunately, his companions had soon forgotten the good things they"
10957,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"had been taught, and behaved so badly that the Missionaries in Egypt"
10958,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"refused to keep them, and turned them out, to find their way back as"
10959,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,best they might to their own people; but Saat had no people of his
10960,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"own, and he never rested until he succeeded in finding the Great White"
10961,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,Man of whom he had heard so much.
10962,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,
10963,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,Lady Baker's kind heart was touched. She determined to keep the little
10964,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,black boy and train him to be her own attendant. He accompanied the
10965,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,"travelers upon their wonderful journey to the Source of the Nile, and"
10966,THE AFRICAN SLAVE BOY.,his attachment to his mistress was very touching.

11014,FAITH LATIMER.,"every thing."""
11015,FAITH LATIMER.,
11016,FAITH LATIMER.,Percy was as full of wonder as little May over the baby sleeper. He
11017,FAITH LATIMER.,"wanted to see the back of her head, but it was resting on the soft"
11018,FAITH LATIMER.,"pillow, and the eyes were tightly closed. May stood at the foot of the"
11019,FAITH LATIMER.,"bed longing, and yet afraid, to pull up the cover, and look at the"
11020,FAITH LATIMER.,"little feet. ""Do you thpect she wearth pink thatin thlipperth like"
11021,FAITH LATIMER.,"thothe in the glath cathe?"" she said."
11022,FAITH LATIMER.,
11023,FAITH LATIMER.,The voices did not waken the baby even when Percy made May give a
11024,FAITH LATIMER.,"little scream as he pulled her braided hair, and carried off the"
11025,FAITH LATIMER.,"ribbon, saying,--""You've got a Chinese pig-tail anyway."" Did you ever"
11026,FAITH LATIMER.,see a big brother do any thing like that? Then Percy went out and
11027,FAITH LATIMER.,"slammed the door, and left little May thinking very hard, and the baby"
11028,FAITH LATIMER.,"asleep, after all that noise. What was May thinking about? She had"
11029,FAITH LATIMER.,"heard mamma talk a great deal about China, and had seen queer pictures"
11030,FAITH LATIMER.,of people with bald heads and a long braid of hair hanging down
11031,FAITH LATIMER.,"behind, and in the cabinet in the sitting-room was a pair of tiny pink"
11032,FAITH LATIMER.,"satin slippers, so small that her little hand could just go into one"
11033,FAITH LATIMER.,"of them. Then she had a Chinese doll with almost a bald head, and the"
11034,FAITH LATIMER.,queerest shaped eyes; and that was why she and Percy wanted this baby
11035,FAITH LATIMER.,to wake up that they might see what she looked like. That very morning
11036,FAITH LATIMER.,"while the children were visiting their grandmother, a carriage came to"
11037,FAITH LATIMER.,"their house, bringing a little baby and its mother; and by the time"
11038,FAITH LATIMER.,"they got home, the child was in May's crib, fast asleep, and the two"
11039,FAITH LATIMER.,mothers were talking together as they had not done for years before.
11040,FAITH LATIMER.,"Baby Elsie was not easily wakened, for she never had a very quiet"
11041,FAITH LATIMER.,"place to sleep in. She was quite used to strange noises on shipboard,"
11042,FAITH LATIMER.,"creaking ropes and escaping steam, loud voices giving orders to"
11043,FAITH LATIMER.,"sailors, sometimes roaring waters and stormy winds. She had been many"
11044,FAITH LATIMER.,"nights in a railroad sleeping-car, and she was not disturbed by the"
11045,FAITH LATIMER.,"rush of wheels, or the whistling of the locomotive. Before that, she"
11046,FAITH LATIMER.,"lived part of her little life on a boat in a narrow river, and a few"
11047,FAITH LATIMER.,"months in a crowded, noisy house. Does it seem as if she had been"
11048,FAITH LATIMER.,quite a traveler? She had just come all the way from China--a land on
11049,FAITH LATIMER.,the other side of the round world--and that was the reason that May
11050,FAITH LATIMER.,called her a Chinese baby. Percy and May had never seen Elsie's
11051,FAITH LATIMER.,"mother, although she was their own aunt, for she and her husband had"
11052,FAITH LATIMER.,"been more than ten years missionaries in China, and had come on a"
11053,FAITH LATIMER.,"visit to America. Don't you think the two mothers, dear sisters, who"
11054,FAITH LATIMER.,"had been so long and so far apart, had a great deal to say to each"
11055,FAITH LATIMER.,other? Do you expect they wanted Elsie to sleep quite as much as her
11056,FAITH LATIMER.,"cousins wanted her to wake? She was a good child, but she knew how to"
11057,FAITH LATIMER.,"cry, and after a few days Percy said,--""She's not so much after all,"
11058,FAITH LATIMER.,"she can't talk and tell us anything, and when she cries, she boo-hoo's"
11059,FAITH LATIMER.,"just as you do, May."""
11060,FAITH LATIMER.,
11061,FAITH LATIMER.,"In a week, two more Chinese travelers came; the baby's father, and"
11062,FAITH LATIMER.,"another cousin, Knox, a boy nine years old. Did you ever fire off a"
11063,FAITH LATIMER.,whole pack of Chinese fire-crackers at a time? That was almost the way
11064,FAITH LATIMER.,"that questions were asked by the two boys, back and forth, so quick"
11065,FAITH LATIMER.,and fast that there was hardly time to answer each one. The boy from
11066,FAITH LATIMER.,Shanghai found as many things strange to him as the New York boy would
11067,FAITH LATIMER.,"have seen in China. Percy, and May, although she could not understand"
11068,FAITH LATIMER.,"half she heard, were full of wonder as Knox told of living on a boat"
11069,FAITH LATIMER.,"in the river, of so many boats around them, where people lived crowded"
11070,FAITH LATIMER.,"together as closely as houses could be on land. He told of the cities,"
11071,FAITH LATIMER.,"of narrow, crooked streets, all the way under awnings, to be shielded"
11072,FAITH LATIMER.,"from the hot sun; of riding many miles in a wheel-barrow, with a"
11073,FAITH LATIMER.,Chinaman to push it along the road. They all laughed when Percy said
11074,FAITH LATIMER.,"they called their cousin Elsie ""a Chinese baby;"" and the grown folks"
11075,FAITH LATIMER.,"helped to tell about the black-eyed babies over there, wrapped up in"
11076,FAITH LATIMER.,"wadded comforts and placed standing, a great, round roll, in a tall"
11077,FAITH LATIMER.,"basket, instead of a cradle. Percy thought the best thing he heard was"
11078,FAITH LATIMER.,"of a boy in a royal family. He had to be well taught, for he must be a"
11079,FAITH LATIMER.,"wise scholar in Chinese learning, but no one dared to touch or hurt"
11080,FAITH LATIMER.,him; so a poor boy of low rank was hired and kept in the house to take
11081,FAITH LATIMER.,all the whippings for him; and whenever the young prince deserved
11082,FAITH LATIMER.,"correction, the bamboo rod was well laid on the poor boy's back. What"
11083,FAITH LATIMER.,would you think of such a plan? Elsie's father and mother were going
11084,FAITH LATIMER.,"back to China, but they were not willing that Knox should grow up"
11085,FAITH LATIMER.,there; he must go to some good school and stay in this country. Even
11086,FAITH LATIMER.,little Elsie they dared not trust out of their sight among the
11087,FAITH LATIMER.,Chinese.
11088,FAITH LATIMER.,
11089,FAITH LATIMER.,"And so for the love of the dear Master, who said,--""Go and teach all"

11093,FAITH LATIMER.,
11094,FAITH LATIMER.,"Don't you believe our heavenly Father will watch over Knox and Elsie,"

11096,FAITH LATIMER.,"where they were born, to carry on the good work their father and"
11097,FAITH LATIMER.,"mother are doing in that strange, far-off country?"
11098,FAITH LATIMER.,
11099,FAITH LATIMER.,Do you know of any ways in which children at home can help such work

11128,KITTY STRIKER.,"The angry goose with hisses fierce,"

11168,MAYING.,like playing better.
11169,MAYING.,
11170,MAYING.,"Phil and I have a little dog of our own, and he belongs between us."
11171,MAYING.,"His name is Dash. He came from the Home for Lost Dogs, and we didn't"
11172,MAYING.,"know his name, so Phil and I sat on the grass, and we called him by"
11173,MAYING.,"every name we could think of, until Phil thought of Dash, and when"
11174,MAYING.,"Dash heard that name he jumped up, and ran to Phil, and licked his"
11175,MAYING.,"face. We don't know what kind of dog he is, and father called him a"
11176,MAYING.,"'terrier spaniel;' but he laughed as he said it, and so we're not"
11177,MAYING.,quite sure that he wasn't in fun. But it doesn't matter what kind of
11178,MAYING.,"dog Dash is, because we are all fond of him, and if you're fond of any"
11179,MAYING.,"one if doesn't matter what they're like, or if they have a pretty"
11180,MAYING.,name.
11181,MAYING.,
11182,MAYING.,"Dash goes out with us when we take a walk, and I'm sure he knew"
11183,MAYING.,"yesterday when we went out without leave, because we wanted to go"
11184,MAYING.,Maying. There's a beautiful hedge full of May blossoms down the lane
11185,MAYING.,"and across the meadow, and we _did_ want some May very badly. So Phil"
11186,MAYING.,"and I went without asking mother, and Dash went with us."
11187,MAYING.,
11188,MAYING.,"We found the place quite easily, and had pulled down several boughs of"
11189,MAYING.,"it, when we heard a gruff voice calling to us, and the farmer came up,"
11190,MAYING.,asking what we were doing to _his_ hedge.
11191,MAYING.,
11192,MAYING.,"I said, ""Please, we didn't know it was yours, and we want some May"
11193,MAYING.,"very much, because to-morrow's the first of June, you know, and Phil"
11194,MAYING.,"says we can't go Maying then."""
11195,MAYING.,
11196,MAYING.,"The farmer didn't say any thing until he caught sight of Dash, and"
11197,MAYING.,"then he called out, angrily,--""If that dog gets among my chickens, I"
11198,MAYING.,"shall have him shot!"""
11199,MAYING.,
11200,MAYING.,"We were so frightened at that, that we ran away; and Dash ran too, as"
11201,MAYING.,if he understood what the farmer said. We didn't stop for any May
11202,MAYING.,"blossoms though we had picked them, and we did want them so, because"
11203,MAYING.,of its being the thirty-first of May.
11204,MAYING.,
11205,MAYING.,"Phil said the farmer was calling after us, but we only ran the faster,"
11206,MAYING.,"for fear he should shoot Dash. When we got home, mother met us in the"
11207,MAYING.,"porch, and asked where we had been; then we told her all about the"
11208,MAYING.,"farmer, and how we wanted to go Maying while we could."
11209,MAYING.,
11210,MAYING.,"She laughed a little, but presently she looked quite grave, and"
11211,MAYING.,"said,--""I'm very glad to find you have told me the whole truth,"
11212,MAYING.,because if you had not I should still have known it. Farmer Grey has
11213,MAYING.,"been here, and he told me about your having gone across his meadow"
11214,MAYING.,that he is keeping for hay. He has brought you all the May you left
11215,MAYING.,"behind, and he says you may have some more if you want it, only you"
11216,MAYING.,"must not walk through the long grass, but go round the meadow by the"
11217,MAYING.,"little side-path. He said he was afraid he had frightened you, and he"
11218,MAYING.,"was sorry."""
11219,MAYING.,
11220,MAYING.,Phil and I had a splendid Maying after that. We made wreaths for
11221,MAYING.,"ourselves, and one for Dash, only we couldn't get him to wear his,"
11222,MAYING.,which was a pity.
11223,MAYING.,
11224,MAYING.,"But the best of all is that mother says she can always trust us,"
11225,MAYING.,because we told the truth at once; and Phil and I think we would
11226,MAYING.,rather never go Maying any more (though we like it so much) than not
11227,MAYING.,"tell her every thing. I'm sure it's a very good plan, and we mean to"
11228,MAYING.,"do it _always_, even when we're quite grown up. Mother laughs at that,"
11229,MAYING.,"and says,--""You will have your secrets then;"" but Phil and I don't"
11230,MAYING.,"think we shall, because it couldn't be a really nice secret if we"

11514,HOPE LEDYARD.,"very young girl to help me about the house, who did not know any thing"

11519,HOPE LEDYARD.,ask me what I wanted for dinner. He was to bring a gentleman home that

11521,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11522,HOPE LEDYARD.,"About ten o'clock Annie, my little servant, came to me and said, ""Oh,"

11529,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11530,HOPE LEDYARD.,I went into the kitchen and there lay a beautiful trout--too pretty to
11531,HOPE LEDYARD.,"eat, it seemed to me. Certainly too pretty to be spoiled by careless"
11532,HOPE LEDYARD.,"cooking. So I took my receipt book and after reading carefully, I"
11533,HOPE LEDYARD.,"stuffed the pretty fish and laid him in a pan all ready for the oven,"
11534,HOPE LEDYARD.,and told Annie to put it in at eleven o'clock.
11535,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11536,HOPE LEDYARD.,"I was pretty tired, so I lay down for a little nap, and had just"
11537,HOPE LEDYARD.,"dropped asleep when Annie came into the room, wringing her hands and"

11539,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11540,HOPE LEDYARD.,"It seems that she had taken the fish out of the safe and put it, pan"

11543,HOPE LEDYARD.,"pepper-box, and when she came back, the pan was empty!"
11544,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11545,HOPE LEDYARD.,"""The cat stole it, Annie,"" I said."

11547,HOPE LEDYARD.,"""Indade and she didn't. The innocent cratur was lyin' on my bed and"

11549,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11550,HOPE LEDYARD.,I tried to quiet the girl; but I told her at last she could go home
11551,HOPE LEDYARD.,"that night, only she must dry her eyes and run to the butcher's for a"
11552,HOPE LEDYARD.,"steak, for the master would be home with a strange gentleman in half"
11553,HOPE LEDYARD.,"an hour. We managed to get the steak cooked, and papa tried to laugh"
11554,HOPE LEDYARD.,"Annie out of the notion of a ghost stealing our beautiful fish, but"
11555,HOPE LEDYARD.,the girl would not smile and was afraid to be left alone in the
11556,HOPE LEDYARD.,kitchen. So after tea she packed up her things and was to take the
11557,HOPE LEDYARD.,stage to the depot; for Annie lived a long way off.
11558,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11559,HOPE LEDYARD.,"Just before the stage came as I was standing at the gate, my eyes full"

11561,HOPE LEDYARD.,saw the lady who lived across the way open her gate and come toward
11562,HOPE LEDYARD.,our house. I saw the stage stop a few doors off as she came to our
11563,HOPE LEDYARD.,gate and bowing to me said:
11564,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11565,HOPE LEDYARD.,"""Excuse me, we are strangers, but did you lose a fine trout to-day?"""
11566,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11567,HOPE LEDYARD.,"She must have thought me mad, for I rushed into the house, and called:"
11568,HOPE LEDYARD.,"""Annie, Annie, I've found the fish! Now put your things back in the"
11569,HOPE LEDYARD.,"bureau, you silly girl."""
11570,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11571,HOPE LEDYARD.,"Then I went back and invited my neighbor in, telling her about Annie's"

11573,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11574,HOPE LEDYARD.,"""Why, it was our Nero--our great dog! I was away at my mother's or I"
11575,HOPE LEDYARD.,"would have brought it back, for I was sure it belonged to you. Nero"
11576,HOPE LEDYARD.,"must have slipped in, nabbed the fish, and brought it to our house. He"
11577,HOPE LEDYARD.,"laid it on the kitchen floor, as if he had done a very good deed, my"
11578,HOPE LEDYARD.,"girl tells me, and she, foolish thing, thought he had brought it from"
11579,HOPE LEDYARD.,"my mother's, and cooked it."""
11580,HOPE LEDYARD.,
11581,HOPE LEDYARD.,"We had a hearty laugh at our stupid servants, and were great friends"
11582,HOPE LEDYARD.,"from that day, and I never see a picture of fish for sale, but I think"
11583,HOPE LEDYARD.,"of my first trout, which I prepared for dinner with such care, but"
11584,HOPE LEDYARD.,"never tasted. Annie never dared say ""ghosts"" after that, and lived"
11585,HOPE LEDYARD.,"with us till Dick was three years old. But there is papa, and these"
11586,HOPE LEDYARD.,little girls must have a piece of cake and run home.
