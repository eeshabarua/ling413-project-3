18,,If this is borrowed by a friend
19,,Right welcome shall he be
20,,"To read, to study, _not_ to _lend_"
21,,But to return to me.
22,,Not that imparted knowledge doth
23,,Diminish learning's store
24,,But books I find if often lent
25,,Return to me no more.

213,I.,
214,I.,"Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,"
215,I.,By famous Hanover city;
216,I.,"The river Weser, deep and wide,"
217,I.,Washes its wall on the southern side;
218,I.,A pleasanter spot you never spied;
219,I.,"But, when begins my ditty,"
220,I.,"Almost five hundred years ago,"
221,I.,To see the townsfolk suffer so
222,I.,"From vermin, was a pity."
223,I.,
224,I.,
225,II.,II.
226,II.,
227,II.,Rats!
228,II.,"They fought the dogs and killed the cats,"
229,II.,"And bit the babies in the cradles,"
230,II.,"And ate the cheeses out of the vats,"
231,II.,"And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,"
232,II.,"Split open the kegs of salted sprats,"
233,II.,"Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,"
234,II.,And even spoiled the women's chats
235,II.,By drowning their speaking
236,II.,With shrieking and squeaking
237,II.,In fifty different sharps and flats.
238,II.,
239,II.,
240,III.,III.
241,III.,
242,III.,At last the people in a body
243,III.,To the Town Hall came flocking:
244,III.,"""'Tis clear,"" cried they, ""our Mayor's a noddy;"
245,III.,And as for our Corporation--shocking
246,III.,To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
247,III.,For dolts that can't or won't determine
248,III.,What's best to rid us of our vermin!
249,III.,"You hope, because you're old and obese,"
250,III.,To find in the furry civic robe ease?
251,III.,"Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking"
252,III.,"To find the remedy we're lacking,"
253,III.,"Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"""
254,III.,At this the Mayor and Corporation
255,III.,Quaked with a mighty consternation.
256,III.,
257,III.,
258,IV.,IV.
259,IV.,
260,IV.,An hour they sat in council;
261,IV.,At length the Mayor broke silence:
262,IV.,"""For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,"
263,IV.,I wish I were a mile hence!
264,IV.,It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--
265,IV.,"I'm sure my poor head aches again,"
266,IV.,"I've scratched it so, and all in vain."
267,IV.,"Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap!"""
268,IV.,"Just as he said this, what should hap"
269,IV.,At the chamber-door but a gentle tap?
270,IV.,"""Bless us,"" cried the Mayor, ""what's that?"""
271,IV.,"(With the Corporation as he sat,"
272,IV.,Looking little though wondrous fat;
273,IV.,"Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister"
274,IV.,"Than a too-long-opened oyster,"
275,IV.,Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous
276,IV.,For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)
277,IV.,"""Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?"
278,IV.,Anything like the sound of a rat
279,IV.,"Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"""
280,IV.,
281,IV.,
282,V.,V.
283,V.,
284,V.,"""Come in!""--the Mayor cried, looking bigger:"
285,V.,And in did come the strangest figure!
286,V.,His queer long coat from heel to head
287,V.,"Was half of yellow and half of red,"
288,V.,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
289,V.,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,"
290,V.,"And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
291,V.,"No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,"
292,V.,But lips where smiles went out and in;
293,V.,There was no guessing his kith and kin:
294,V.,And nobody could enough admire
295,V.,The tall man and his quaint attire.
296,V.,"Quoth one: ""It's as my great-grandsire,"
297,V.,"Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,"
298,V.,"Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"""
299,V.,
300,V.,
301,VI.,VI.
302,VI.,
303,VI.,He advanced to the council-table:
304,VI.,"And, ""Please your honours,"" said he, ""I'm able,"
305,VI.,"By means of a secret charm, to draw"
306,VI.,"All creatures living beneath the sun,"
307,VI.,"That creep or swim or fly or run,"
308,VI.,After me so as you never saw!
309,VI.,And I chiefly use my charm
310,VI.,"On creatures that do people harm,"
311,VI.,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
312,VI.,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
313,VI.,(And here they noticed round his neck
314,VI.,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
315,VI.,To match with his coat of the self-same cheque;
316,VI.,And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
317,VI.,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying"
318,VI.,As if impatient to be playing
319,VI.,"Upon this pipe, as low it dangled"
320,VI.,Over his vesture so old-fangled.)
321,VI.,"""Yet,"" said he, ""poor piper as I am,"
322,VI.,"In Tartary I freed the Cham,"
323,VI.,"Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;"
324,VI.,I eased in Asia the Nizam

335,VII.,"Into the street the Piper stept,"
336,VII.,"Smiling first a little smile,"
337,VII.,As if he knew what magic slept
338,VII.,In his quiet pipe the while;
339,VII.,"Then, like a musical adept,"
340,VII.,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
341,VII.,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
342,VII.,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
343,VII.,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
344,VII.,You heard as if an army muttered;
345,VII.,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
346,VII.,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
347,VII.,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
348,VII.,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats"
349,VII.,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats"
350,VII.,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
351,VII.,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
352,VII.,"Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,"
353,VII.,"Families by tens and dozens,"
354,VII.,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--"
355,VII.,Followed the Piper for their lives.
356,VII.,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
357,VII.,"And step for step they followed dancing,"
358,VII.,"Until they came to the river Weser,"
359,VII.,Wherein all plunged and perished!
360,VII.,"--Save one who, stout as Julius Cæsar,"
361,VII.,Swam across and lived to carry
362,VII.,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)"
363,VII.,To Rat-land home his commentary:
364,VII.,"Which was, ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
365,VII.,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
366,VII.,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
367,VII.,Into a cider-press's gripe:
368,VII.,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
369,VII.,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
370,VII.,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
371,VII.,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:
372,VII.,And it seemed as if a voice
373,VII.,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
374,VII.,"Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice!"
375,VII.,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
376,VII.,"So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,"
377,VII.,"Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'"
378,VII.,"And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,"
379,VII.,"All ready staved, like a great sun shone"
380,VII.,"Glorious scarce an inch before me,"

402,IX.,For council dinners made rare havoc
403,IX.,"With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;"
404,IX.,And half the money would replenish
405,IX.,Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.

451,XII.,And ere he blew three notes (such sweet
452,XII.,Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
453,XII.,Never gave the enraptured air)
454,XII.,There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
455,XII.,Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
456,XII.,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,"
457,XII.,"Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,"
458,XII.,"And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,"
459,XII.,Out came the children running.
460,XII.,"All the little boys and girls,"
461,XII.,"With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,"
462,XII.,"And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,"

473,XIII.,--Could only follow with the eye
474,XIII.,That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
475,XIII.,"But how the Mayor was on the rack,"
476,XIII.,"And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,"
477,XIII.,As the Piper turned from the High Street
478,XIII.,To where the Weser rolled its waters
479,XIII.,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
480,XIII.,"However, he turned from South to West,"
481,XIII.,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,"
482,XIII.,And after him the children pressed;
483,XIII.,Great was the joy in every breast.
484,XIII.,"""He never can cross that mighty top!"
485,XIII.,"He's forced to let the piping drop,"
486,XIII.,"And we shall see our children stop!"""
487,XIII.,"When, lo, as they reached the mountainside,"
488,XIII.,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
489,XIII.,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
490,XIII.,"And the Piper advanced and the children followed,"
491,XIII.,"And when all were in to the very last,"
492,XIII.,The door in the mountainside shut fast.
493,XIII.,"Did I say, all? No! One was lame,"
494,XIII.,And could not dance the whole of the way;
495,XIII.,"And in after years, if you would blame"
496,XIII.,"His sadness, he was used to say,--"

502,XIII.,"Joining the town and just at hand,"
503,XIII.,Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew
504,XIII.,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
505,XIII.,And everything was strange and new;
506,XIII.,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,"
507,XIII.,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"
508,XIII.,"And honey-bees had lost their stings,"
509,XIII.,And horses were born with eagles' wings:
510,XIII.,And just as I became assured
511,XIII.,"My lame foot would be speedily cured,"
512,XIII.,"The music stopped and I stood still,"
513,XIII.,"And found myself outside the hill,"

529,XIV.,"Silver and gold to his heart's content,"

532,XIV.,"But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,"
533,XIV.,"And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,"
534,XIV.,They made a decree that lawyers never
535,XIV.,Should think their records dated duly

545,XIV.,Was sure for the future to lose his labour.
546,XIV.,Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
547,XIV.,To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
548,XIV.,But opposite the place of the cavern
549,XIV.,"They wrote the story on a column,"
550,XIV.,And on the great church-window painted
551,XIV.,"The same, to make the world acquainted"
552,XIV.,"How their children were stolen away,"
