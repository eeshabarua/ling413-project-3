47,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
48,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.
49,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,
50,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,
51,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,This little book is dedicated to parents and children. Most of the
52,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"poems were written with no other hope, than that they would instruct"
53,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,or please some child. The pleasure they have given in a limited circle
54,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,has tempted the writer to print them. Some have never before appeared
55,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"in public, but most of them have been already published in different"
56,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"works; some few, without the author's knowledge."
57,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,
58,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,It will be found that these poems are intended for children of
59,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"different ages and characters. It may be objected to the book, that"
60,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,gay and serious pieces are bound up together; but so it is in human
61,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"life and human nature, and it is essential to the healthful action of"
62,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,a child's mind that it should be so. The smile that overtakes its
63,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,tears is as necessary to the child as the sun after a spring shower
64,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,is to the young plant; and without it a blight will fall upon the
65,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,opening blossom.
66,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,
67,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"The natural love that all have for their literary offspring, perhaps,"
68,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,first induced the author to bring the stray little family together.
69,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,This motive was strengthened by the hope that children might love the
70,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"book, and that she might have the pleasure of seeing it among their"
71,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"treasures, with the corners of the leaves well worn by their little"
72,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"fingers, and perhaps sometimes placed upon the pillow where ""angels"
73,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"hover round."""
74,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,
75,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"This success, which must secure to her also the approbation of"
76,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"parents, she does aspire after, and most earnestly desire; this, and"
77,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,"this alone, will satisfy her; without this, she would be the first to"
78,BY CHARLES FOLLEN.,pronounce it an unworthy offering.

92,TO THE PRESENT EDITION.,"limited circulation, and also by a number of translations from the"
93,TO THE PRESENT EDITION.,German. If they should have the good fortune to add to the innocent
94,TO THE PRESENT EDITION.,"pleasure of the young, and deserve to become associated in their minds"
