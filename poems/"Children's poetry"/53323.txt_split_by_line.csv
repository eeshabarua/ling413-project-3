52,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.
53,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,
54,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,
55,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,In presenting to the American public this new and beautiful edition of a
56,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"work that has been established as a favourite for nearly half a century,"
57,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"the publishers do not think it needful to enlarge upon its merits, or to"
58,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,point out the attractions which have secured for it a popularity so
59,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"universal and long continued. Fifteen editions in England, and probably"
60,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"an equal or greater number in this country, have already borne testimony"
61,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"in that behalf, much stronger than any praises which they can bestow."
62,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,Yet they may be permitted briefly to suggest a comparison between this
63,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"charming specimen of the good old school, and most of the illustrated"
64,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"works that have recently been brought out in such profusion, professedly"
65,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"for the entertainment and instruction of youth; works, in the majority"
66,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,of which there is exhibited so little of that peculiar talent required
67,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"for imparting instruction with entertainment, and so little judgment in"
68,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"the choice of subjects, as well as in the manner of dealing with them."
69,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,The great defect of these books—at least the greater portion of them—is
70,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,the total want of pure and unaffected simplicity; the principal
71,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"characteristic of well-trained youth, and therefore indispensable in"
72,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,everything designed for youthful readers. Multitudes of authors have
73,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"written, of late years, for childhood; but small, indeed, is the number"
74,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"of those who, like Mrs. Barbauld and Dr. Aikin, possess the faculty of"
75,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,adaptation to the tastes and intellects of children; and in the effort
76,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"to make books suited to those tastes and intellects, they succeed only"
77,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"in producing things too puerile for grown-up people, and so tainted with"
78,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,the affectation of simplicity that the natural feelings of the child can
79,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,give to them no sympathy. And it would be a subject for rejoicing if
80,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,this were the worst or only fault with which some of them are
81,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,chargeable.
82,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,
83,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,The nearest approach to perfection that a book written for young people
84,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"can make, is to give the idea of having been written by one of them."
85,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"When a child reads a story, and fancies that he could write just such"
86,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"another, we may be sure that the author has hit the mark. This test of"
87,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"excellence the “Evenings at Home” bears with a success unrivalled, as"
88,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,must be within the experience of many parents. There is scarcely another
89,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"book ever placed in the hands of children, from the age of four or five"
90,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"years to that of twelve or fourteen, which they read with so much"
91,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"delight, or remember so long and well, or by which they are so strongly"
92,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,incited to the attempt at composition.
93,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,
94,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"Knowing the excellence of the work, and its enduring popularity, the"
95,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,publishers have thought it worthy of a better style of publication than
96,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,it has ever enjoyed in this country; they have therefore brought out
97,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"this handsome edition on the best of paper, and for its embellishment"
98,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,secured the valuable services of the same unrivalled engraver on wood
99,PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.,"who illustrated their “Fairy Book,” and their editions of “Robinson"

106,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,
107,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,
108,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"The thirteenth edition of “Evenings at Home,” a work which has not been"
109,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,superseded in general estimation by any later publication for the
110,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"instruction and amusement of youth, appeared in 1823, enriched with the"
111,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"addition of some new pieces, and carefully revised and corrected"
112,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"throughout by Mr. Arthur Aikin. Since that time, its venerable author,"
113,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"and his distinguished sister and coadjutor, have both paid the debt of"
114,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,nature; and it appears proper to introduce this posthumous
115,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"republication, by an account of their respective shares in its"
116,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"production. The plan, then, of the work originated solely with Dr."
117,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"Aikin; the Introduction and Epilogue are both his, and about eleven"
118,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"parts in twelve of the whole. The pieces written by Mrs. Barbauld,"
119,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"including one found among her papers, and now first printed, are, the"
120,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"Young Mouse; the Wasp and Bee; Alfred, a Drama; Animals and their"
121,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,Countries; Canute’s Reproof to his Courtiers; the Mask of Nature; Things
122,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,by their Right Names; the Goose and Horse; On Manufactures; the
123,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,Flying-Fish; a Lesson on the Art of Distinguishing; the Phenix and Dove;
124,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,the Manufacture of Paper; the Four Sisters; and Live Dolls;—amounting to
125,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,fifteen out of one hundred and one.
126,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,
127,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"A new arrangement of the matter has been followed in this edition, for"
128,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,which the editor is answerable. Her father was precluded from attending
129,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"to this point in the first instance, by the manner in which the work"
130,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"grew under his hand. The volumes came out one or two at a time, with an"
131,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,interval of several years between the earliest and the latest. He did
132,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,not at first contemplate so extensive a work; but his invention flowed
133,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,freely—the applause of parents and the delight of children invited him
134,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,to proceed; the slight thread by which he had connected the pieces was
135,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"capable of being drawn out indefinitely, and the plan was confessedly"
136,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"that of a miscellany. Under these circumstances, it appeared allowable"
137,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"on a view of the whole work, to change the order, so as to conduct the"
138,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"young reader, in a gentle progress, from the easier pieces to the more"
139,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"difficult; or rather, to adapt the different volumes to different ages,"
140,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,by which the inconvenience might be avoided of either putting the whole
141,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"set into the hands of a child, while one portion of its contents would"
142,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"not be intelligible to him, or withholding the whole until another"
143,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"portion should have ceased to be interesting. This idea the editor has,"
144,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"to the best of her ability, put in execution. Should she thus be the"
145,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"humble means of extending, in any degree, the influence of her father’s"
146,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,"wisdom and genius—of his extensive knowledge, his manly principles, and"
147,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,his genuine benevolence and tenderness of heart—her pains will be amply
148,PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.,rewarded.

264,INTRODUCTION,"The mansion-house of the pleasant village of _Beechgrove_, was inhabited"
265,INTRODUCTION,"by the family of FAIRBORNE, consisting of the master and mistress, and a"
266,INTRODUCTION,"numerous progeny of children of both sexes. Of these, part were educated"
267,INTRODUCTION,"at home under their parents’ care, and part were sent out to school. The"
268,INTRODUCTION,"house was seldom unprovided with visiters, the intimate friends or"
269,INTRODUCTION,"relations of the owners, who were entertained with cheerfulness and"
270,INTRODUCTION,"hospitality, free from ceremony and parade. They formed, during their"
271,INTRODUCTION,"stay, part of the family; and were ready to concur with Mr. and Mrs."
272,INTRODUCTION,"Fairborne in any little domestic plan for varying their amusements, and"
273,INTRODUCTION,particularly for promoting the instruction and entertainment of the
274,INTRODUCTION,younger part of the household. As some of them were accustomed to
275,INTRODUCTION,"writing, they would frequently produce a fable, a story, or dialogue,"
276,INTRODUCTION,adapted to the age and understanding of the young people. It was always
277,INTRODUCTION,considered as a high favour when they would so employ themselves; and
278,INTRODUCTION,"when the pieces were once read over, they were carefully deposited by"
279,INTRODUCTION,"Mrs. Fairborne in a box, of which she kept the key. None of these were"
280,INTRODUCTION,allowed to be taken out again till all the children were assembled in
281,INTRODUCTION,the holydays. It was then made one of the evening amusements of the
282,INTRODUCTION,"family to _rummage the budget_, as their phrase was. One of the least"
283,INTRODUCTION,"children was sent to the box, who putting in its little hand, drew out"
284,INTRODUCTION,"the paper that came next, and brought it into the parlour. This was then"
285,INTRODUCTION,read distinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had undergone
286,INTRODUCTION,"sufficient consideration, another little messenger was despatched for a"
287,INTRODUCTION,"fresh supply; and so on, till as much time had been spent in this manner"
288,INTRODUCTION,as the parents thought proper. Other children were admitted to these
289,INTRODUCTION,readings; and as the _Budget of Beechgrove Hall_ became somewhat
290,INTRODUCTION,"celebrated in the neighbourhood, its proprietors were at length urged to"
291,INTRODUCTION,"lay it open to the public. They were induced to comply; and thus,"
292,INTRODUCTION,"without further preface, begins the “First Evening.”"

305,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,A young mouse lived in a cupboard where sweetmeats were kept; she dined
306,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"every day upon biscuit, marmalade, or fine sugar. Never had any little"
307,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,mouse lived so well. She had often ventured to peep at the family while
308,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"they sat at supper; nay, she had sometimes stolen down on the carpet,"
309,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"and picked up the crumbs, and nobody had ever hurt her. She would have"
310,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"been quite happy, but that she was sometimes frightened by the cat, and"
311,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,then she ran trembling to the hole behind the wainscot. One day she came
312,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"running to her mother in great joy. “Mother,” said she, “the good people"
313,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,of this family have built me a house to live in; it is in the cupboard:
314,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"I am sure it is for me, for it is just big enough: the bottom is of"
315,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"wood, and it is covered all over with wires! and I dare say they have"
316,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"made it on purpose to screen me from that terrible cat, which ran after"
317,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"me so often; there is an entrance just big enough for me, but puss"
318,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,cannot follow; and they have been so good as to put in some toasted
319,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"cheese, which smells so deliciously, that I should have run in directly"
320,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"and taken possession of my new house, but I thought I would tell you"
321,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"first, that we might go in together, and both lodge there to-night, for"
322,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,it will hold us both.”
323,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,
324,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"“My dear child,” said the old mouse, “it is most happy that you did not"
325,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"go in, for this house is called a trap, and you would never have come"
326,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"out again, except to have been devoured, or put to death in some way or"
327,THE YOUNG MOUSE.—A FABLE.,"other. Though man has not so fierce a look as a cat, he is as much our"

336,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"A wasp met a bee, and said to him, “Pray, can you tell me what is the"
337,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"reason that men are so ill-natured to me, while they are so fond of you?"
338,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"We are both very much alike, only that the broad golden rings about my"
339,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"body make me much handsomer than you are: we are both winged insects, we"
340,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"both love honey, and we both sting people when we are angry, yet men"
341,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"always hate me and try to kill me, though I am much more familiar with"
342,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"them than you are, and pay them visits in their houses, and at their"
343,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"tea-table, and at all their meals; while you are very shy, and hardly"
344,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"ever come near them: yet they build you curious houses, thatched with"
345,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"straw, and take care of and feed you in the winter very often:—I wonder"
346,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,what is the reason?”
347,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,
348,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"The bee said, “Because you never do them any good, but, on the contrary,"
349,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"are very troublesome and mischievous; therefore, they do not like to see"
350,THE WASP AND BEE.—A FABLE.,"you, but they know that I am busy all day long in making them honey. You"

358,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,
359,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"A goose, who was plucking grass upon a common, thought herself affronted"
360,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"by a _horse_ who fed near her, and in hissing accents thus addressed"
361,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"him: “I am certainly a more noble and perfect animal than you, for the"
362,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,whole range and extent of your faculties is confined to one element. I
363,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"can walk upon the ground as well as you: I have besides wings, with"
364,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"which I can raise myself in the air; and when I please, I can sport in"
365,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"ponds and lakes, and refresh myself in the cool waters: I enjoy the"
366,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"different powers of a bird, a fish, and a quadruped.”"
367,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,
368,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"The _horse_, snorting somewhat disdainfully, replied, “It is true you"
369,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"inhabit three elements, but you make no very distinguished figure in any"
370,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"one of them. You fly, indeed; but your flight is so heavy and clumsy,"
371,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,that you have no right to put yourself on a level with the lark or the
372,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"swallow. You can swim on the surface of the waters, but you cannot live"
373,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"in them as fishes do; you cannot find your food in that element, nor"
374,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"glide smoothly along the bottom of the waves. And when you walk, or"
375,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"rather waddle, upon the ground, with your broad feet, and your long neck"
376,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"stretched out, hissing at every one who passes by, you bring upon"
377,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,yourself the derision of all beholders. I confess that I am only formed
378,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,to move upon the ground; but how graceful is my make! how well turned my
379,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,limbs! how highly finished my whole body! how great my strength! how
380,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"astonishing my speed! I had far rather be confined to one element, and"
381,THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—A FABLE.,"be admired in that, than be a _goose_ in all.”"

389,THE FLYING-FISH.,"The flying-fish, says the fable, had originally no wings, but being of"
390,THE FLYING-FISH.,"an ambitious and discontented temper, she repined at being always"
391,THE FLYING-FISH.,"confined to the waters, and wished to soar in the air. “If I could fly"
392,THE FLYING-FISH.,"like the birds,” said she, “I should not only see more of the beauties"
393,THE FLYING-FISH.,"of nature, but I should be able to escape from those fish which are"
394,THE FLYING-FISH.,"continually pursuing me, and which render my life miserable.” She"
395,THE FLYING-FISH.,therefore petitioned Jupiter for a pair of wings; and immediately she
396,THE FLYING-FISH.,perceived her fins to expand. They suddenly grew to the length of her
397,THE FLYING-FISH.,"whole body, and became at the same time so strong as to do the office of"
398,THE FLYING-FISH.,"a pinion. She was at first much pleased with her new powers, and looked"
399,THE FLYING-FISH.,with an air of disdain on all her former companions; but she soon
400,THE FLYING-FISH.,"perceived herself exposed to new dangers. When flying in the air, she"
401,THE FLYING-FISH.,was incessantly pursued by the tropic bird and the albatross; and when
402,THE FLYING-FISH.,"for safety she dropped into the water, she was so fatigued with her"
403,THE FLYING-FISH.,"flight, that she was less able than ever to escape from her old enemies"
404,THE FLYING-FISH.,"the fish. Finding herself more unhappy than before, she now begged of"
405,THE FLYING-FISH.,"Jupiter to recall his present; but Jupiter said to her, “When I gave you"
406,THE FLYING-FISH.,"your wings, I well knew they would prove a curse; but your proud and"
407,THE FLYING-FISH.,"restless disposition deserved this disappointment. Now, therefore, what"
408,THE FLYING-FISH.,"you begged as a favour, keep as a punishment!”"

416,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"“What shall I do,” said a very little dog one day to his mother, “to"
417,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"show my gratitude to our good master, and make myself of some value to"
418,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"him? I cannot draw or carry burdens, like the horse, nor give him milk,"
419,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"like the cow; nor lend him my covering for his clothing, like the sheep;"
420,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"nor produce him eggs, like the poultry; nor catch mice and rats so well"
421,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"as the cat. I cannot divert him with singing, like the canaries and"
422,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"linnets; nor can I defend him against robbers, like our relation Towzer."
423,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"I should not be of use to him even if I were dead, as the hogs are. I am"
424,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"a poor insignificant creature, not worth the cost of keeping; and I"
425,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,don’t see that I can do a single thing to entitle me to his regard.” So
426,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"saying, the poor little dog hung down his head in silent despondency."
427,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,
428,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"“My dear child,” replied his mother, “though your abilities are but"
429,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"small, yet a hearty good will is sufficient to supply all defects. Do"
430,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"but love him dearly, and prove your love by all the means in your power,"
431,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,and you will not fail to please him.”
432,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,
433,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,The little dog was comforted with this assurance; and on his master’s
434,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"approach, ran to him, licked his feet, gambolled before him, and every"
435,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"now and then stopped, wagging his tail, and looking up to his master"
436,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,with expressions of the most humble and affectionate attachment. The
437,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"master observed him. “Ah, little Fido,” said he, “you are an honest,"
438,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,good-natured little fellow!”—and stooped down to pat his head. Poor Fido
439,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,was ready to go out of his wits for joy.
440,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,
441,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"Fido was now his master’s constant companion in his walks, playing and"
442,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"skipping round him, and amusing him by a thousand sportive tricks. He"
443,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"took care, however, not to be troublesome by leaping on him with dirty"
444,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"paws, nor would he follow him into the parlour, unless invited. He also"
445,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,attempted to make himself useful by a number of little services. He
446,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"would drive away the sparrows as they were stealing the chickens’ food,"
447,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,and would run and bark with the utmost fury at any strange pigs or other
448,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"animals that offered to come into the yard. He kept the poultry, geese,"
449,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"and pigs, from straying beyond their bounds, and particularly from doing"
450,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,mischief in the garden. He was always ready to alarm Towzer if there was
451,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"any suspicious noise about the house, day or night. If his master pulled"
452,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"off his coat in the field to help his workmen, as he would sometimes do,"
453,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"Fido always sat by it, and would not suffer either man or beast to touch"
454,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,it. By this means he came to be considered as a very trusty protector of
455,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,his master’s property.
456,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,
457,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,His master was once confined to his bed with a dangerous illness. Fido
458,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"planted himself at the chamber-door, and could not be persuaded to leave"
459,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"it, even to take food; and as soon as his master was so far recovered as"
460,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"to sit up, Fido being admitted into the room, ran up to him with such"
461,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"marks of excessive joy and affection, as would have melted any heart to"
462,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"behold. This circumstance wonderfully endeared him to his master; and,"
463,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"some time after, he had an opportunity of doing him a very important"
464,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"service. One hot day, after dinner, his master was sleeping in a"
465,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,summer-house with Fido by his side. The building was old and crazy; and
466,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"the dog, who was faithfully watching his master, perceived the walls"
467,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"shake, and pieces of mortar fall from the ceiling. He comprehended the"
468,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"danger, and began barking to awake his master; and this not sufficing,"
469,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"he jumped up and gently bit his finger. The master, upon this, started"
470,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"up, and had just time to get out of the door before the whole building"
471,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"fell down. Fido, who was behind, got hurt by some rubbish which fell"
472,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,upon him; on which his master had him taken care of with the utmost
473,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"tenderness, and ever after acknowledged his obligation to this animal as"
474,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,the preserver of his life. Thus his love and fidelity had their full
475,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,reward.
476,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,
477,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,MORAL.—The poorest man may repay his obligations to the richest and
478,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,greatest by faithful and affectionate service—the meanest creature may
479,THE LITTLE DOG.—A FABLE.,"obtain the favour and regard of the Creator himself, by humble gratitude"

486,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
487,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
488,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"One winter’s evening, as _Captain Compass_ was sitting by the fireside"
489,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"with his children all around him, little Jack said to him, “Papa, pray"
490,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,tell us some stories about what you have seen in your voyages. I have
491,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"been vastly entertained, while you were abroad, with Gulliver’s Travels,"
492,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"and the Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor; and I think, as you have gone"
493,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"round and round the world, you must have met with things as wonderful as"
494,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"they did.”—“No, my dear,” said the captain, “I never met with"
495,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"Lilliputians or Brobdignagians, I assure you, nor ever saw the black"
496,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"loadstone mountain, or the valley of diamonds; but, to be sure, I have"
497,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"seen a great variety of people, and their different manners and ways of"
498,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"living; and if it will be any entertainment to you, I will tell you some"
499,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"curious particulars of what I observed.”—“Pray do, papa,” cried Jack and"
500,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"all his brothers and sisters: so they drew close round him, and he began"
501,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,as follows:—
502,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
503,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“Well, then—I was once, about this time of the year, in a country where"
504,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"it was very cold, and the poor inhabitants had much ado to keep"
505,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"themselves from starving. They were clad partly in the skins of beasts,"
506,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"made smooth and soft by a particular art, but chiefly in garments made"
507,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"from the outward covering of a middle-sized quadruped, which they were"
508,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,so cruel as to strip off his back while he was alive. They dwelt in
509,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"habitations, part of which was sunk underground. The materials were"
510,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"either stones, or earth hardened by fire; and so violent in that country"
511,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"were the storms of wind and rain, that many of them covered their roofs"
512,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,all over with stones. The walls of their houses had holes to let in the
513,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"light: but to prevent the cold air and wet from coming in, they were"
514,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"covered by a sort of transparent stone, made artificially of melted sand"
515,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"or flints. As wood was rather scarce, I know not what they would have"
516,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"done for firing, had they not discovered in the bowels of the earth a"
517,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"very extraordinary kind of stone, which when put among burning wood,"
518,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,caught fire and flamed like a torch.”
519,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
520,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“Dear me,” said Jack, “what a wonderful stone! I suppose it was somewhat"
521,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"like what we call fire-stones, that shine so when we rub them"
522,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"together.”—“I don’t think they would burn,” replied the captain;"
523,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“besides, these are of a darker colour.”"
524,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
525,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,“Well—but their diet too was remarkable. Some of them ate fish that had
526,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,been hung up in the smoke till they were quite dry and hard; and along
527,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"with it they ate either the roots of plants, or a sort of coarse black"
528,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,cake made of powdered seeds. These were the poorer class; the richer had
529,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"a whiter kind of cake, which they were fond of daubing over with a"
530,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,greasy matter that was the product of a large animal among them. This
531,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"grease they used, too, in almost all their dishes, and, when fresh, it"
532,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,really was not unpalatable. They likewise devoured the flesh of many
533,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,birds and beasts when they could get it; and ate the leaves and other
534,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"parts of a variety of vegetables growing in the country, some absolutely"
535,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"raw, others variously prepared by the aid of fire. Another great article"
536,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"of food was the curd of milk, pressed into a hard mass and salted. This"
537,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"had so rank a smell, that persons of weak stomachs often could not bear"
538,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"to come near it. For drink, they made great use of the water in which"
539,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"certain dry leaves had been steeped. These leaves, I was told, came from"
540,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,a great distance. They had likewise a method of preparing a liquor of
541,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,the seeds of a grasslike plant steeped in water with the addition of a
542,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"bitter herb, and then set to work or ferment. I was prevailed upon to"
543,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"taste it, and thought it at first nauseous enough, but in time I liked"
544,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"it pretty well. When a large quantity of the ingredients is used, it"
545,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"becomes perfectly intoxicating. But what astonished me most, was their"
546,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,use of a liquor so excessively hot and pungent that it seems like liquid
547,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"fire. I once got a mouthful of it by mistake, taking it for water, which"
548,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"it resembles in appearance, but I thought it would instantly have taken"
549,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"away my breath. Indeed, people are not unfrequently killed by it; and"
550,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,yet many of them will swallow it greedily whenever they can get it.
551,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"This, too, is said to be prepared from the seeds abovementioned, which"
552,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"are innocent and even salutary in their natural state, though made to"
553,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,yield such a pernicious juice. The strangest custom that I believe
554,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"prevails in any nation I found here, which was, that some take a mighty"
555,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"pleasure in filling their mouths full of stinking smoke and others, in"
556,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,thrusting a nasty powder up their nostrils.”
557,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
558,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“I should think it would choke them,” said Jack. “It almost did me,”"
559,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"answered his father, “only to stand by while they did it—but use, it is"
560,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"truly said, is second nature.”"
561,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
562,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,“I was glad enough to leave this cold climate; and about half a year
563,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"after, I fell in with a people enjoying a delicious temperature of air,"
564,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,and a country full of beauty and verdure. The trees and shrubs were
565,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"furnished with a great variety of fruits, which, with other vegetable"
566,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"products, constituted a large part of the food of the inhabitants. I"
567,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"particularly relished certain berries growing in bunches, some white and"
568,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"some red, of a very pleasant sourish taste, and so transparent that one"
569,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,might see the seeds at their very centre. Here were whole fields full of
570,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"extremely odoriferous flowers, which they told me were succeeded by pods"
571,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"bearing seeds, that afforded good nourishment to man and beast. A great"
572,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,variety of birds enlivened the groves and woods; among which I was
573,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"entertained with one, that without any teaching spoke almost as"
574,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"articulately as a parrot, though indeed it was only a repetition of a"
575,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"single word. The people were tolerably gentle and civilized, and"
576,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,possessed many of the arts of life. Their dress was very various. Many
577,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,were clad only in a thin cloth made of the long fibres of the stalk of a
578,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"plant cultivated for the purpose, which they prepared by soaking in"
579,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"water, and then beating with large mallets. Others wore cloth woven from"
580,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"a sort of vegetable wool, growing in pods upon bushes. But the most"
581,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"singular material was a fine glossy stuff, used chiefly by the richer"
582,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"classes, which, as I was credibly informed, is manufactured out of the"
583,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"webs of caterpillars—a most wonderful circumstance, if we consider the"
584,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,immense number of caterpillars necessary to the production of so large a
585,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,quantity of stuff as I saw used. This people are very fantastic in their
586,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"dress, especially the women, whose apparel consists of a great number of"
587,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"articles impossible to be described, and strangely disguising the"
588,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,natural form of the body. In some instances they seem very cleanly; but
589,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"in others, the Hottentots can scarce go beyond them; particularly in the"
590,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"management of their hair, which is all matted and stiffened with the fat"
591,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"of swine and other animals, mixed up with powders of various colours and"
592,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"ingredients. Like most Indian nations, they use feathers in their"
593,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"head-dress. One thing surprised me much, which was, that they bring up"
594,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"in their houses an animal of the tiger-kind, with formidable teeth and"
595,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"claws, which, notwithstanding its natural ferocity, is played with and"
596,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,caressed by the most timid and delicate of their women.”
597,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
598,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“I am sure I would not play with it,” said Jack. “Why, you might chance"
599,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"to get an ugly scratch if you did,” said the captain."
600,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
601,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,“The language of this nation seems very harsh and unintelligible to a
602,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"foreigner, yet they converse among one another with great ease and"
603,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,quickness. One of the oddest customs is that which men use on saluting
604,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"each other. Let the weather be what it will, they uncover their heads,"
605,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"and remain uncovered for some time, if they mean to be extraordinarily"
606,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,respectful.”
607,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,
608,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“Why that’s like pulling off our hats,” said Jack.—“Ah, ah! papa,” cried"
609,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"Betsy, “I have found you out. You have been telling us of our own"
610,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"country, and what is done at home, all this while!”—“But,” said Jack,"
611,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"“we don’t burn stones or eat grease and powdered seeds, or wear skins"
612,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"and caterpillars’ webs, or play with tigers.”—“No?” said the"
613,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"Captain—“pray, what are coals but stones? and is not butter, grease; and"
614,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"corn, seeds: and leather, skins; and silk, the web of a kind of"
615,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,caterpillar? And may we not as well call a cat an animal of the tiger
616,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"kind, as a tiger an animal of the cat-kind? So, if you recollect what I"
617,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"have been describing, you will find, with Betsy’s help, that all the"
618,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,other wonderful things I have told you of are matters familiar among
619,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"ourselves. But I meant to show you, that a foreigner might easily"
620,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,represent everything as equally strange and wonderful among us as we
621,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,could do with respect to his country; and also to make you sensible that
622,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"we daily call a great many things by their names, without ever inquiring"
623,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"into their nature and properties; so that, in reality, it is only their"
624,TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.,"names, and not the things themselves, with which we are acquainted.”"

631,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,
632,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"In a pleasant wood, on the western side of a ridge of mountains, there"
633,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"lived a _squirrel_, who had passed two or three years of his life very"
634,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"happily. At length, he began to grow discontented, and one day fell into"
635,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,the following soliloquy:—
636,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,
637,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"“What, must I spend all my time in this spot, running up and down the"
638,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"same trees, gathering nuts and acorns, and dozing away months together"
639,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,in a hole! I see a great many of the birds who inhabit this wood ramble
640,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"about to a distance wherever their fancy leads them; and, at the"
641,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"approach of winter, set out for some remote country, where they enjoy"
642,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,summer weather all the year round. My neighbour cuckoo tells me he is
643,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"just going; and even little nightingale will soon follow. To be sure, I"
644,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"have not wings like them, but I have legs nimble enough; and if one does"
645,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"not use them, one might as well be a mole or a dormouse. I dare say I"
646,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,could easily reach to that blue ridge which I see from the tops of the
647,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"trees, which no doubt must be a fine place; for the sun comes directly"
648,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"from it every morning, and it often appears all covered with red and"
649,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"yellow, and the finest colours imaginable. There can be no harm, at"
650,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"least, in trying; for I can soon get back again if I don’t like it. I am"
651,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"resolved to go, and I will set out to-morrow morning.”"
652,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,
653,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"When squirrel had taken this resolution, he could not sleep all night"
654,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"for thinking of it; and at peep of day, prudently taking with him as"
655,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"much provision as he could conveniently carry, he began his journey in"
656,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"high spirits. He presently got to the outside of the wood, and entered"
657,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,upon the open moors that reached to the foot of the hills. These he
658,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"crossed before the sun was gotten high; and then, having eaten his"
659,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"breakfast with an excellent appetite, he began to ascend. It was heavy"
660,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,toilsome work scrambling up the steep sides of the mountains; but
661,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,squirrel was used to climbing; so for awhile he proceeded expeditiously.
662,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"Often, however, was he obliged to stop and take breath; so that it was a"
663,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,good deal past noon before he had arrived at the summit of the first
664,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"cliff. Here he sat down to eat his dinner; and looking back, was"
665,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,wonderfully pleased with the fine prospect. The wood in which he lived
666,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,lay far beneath his feet; and he viewed with scorn the humble habitation
667,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,in which he had been born and bred.
668,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,
669,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"When he looked forward, however, he was somewhat discouraged to observe"
670,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"that another eminence rose above him, full as distant as that to which"
671,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,he had already reached; and he now began to feel stiff and fatigued.
672,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"However, after a little rest, he set out again, though not so briskly as"
673,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"before. The ground was rugged, brown, and bare; and to his great"
674,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"surprise, instead of finding it warmer as he got nearer the sun, he felt"
675,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,it grow colder and colder. He had not travelled two hours before his
676,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,strength and spirits were almost spent; and he seriously thought of
677,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"giving up the point, and returning before night should come on. While he"
678,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"was thus deliberating with himself, clouds began to gather round the"
679,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"mountain, and to take away all view of distant objects. Presently, a"
680,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"storm of mingled snow and hail came down, driven by a violent wind,"
681,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"which pelted poor squirrel most pitifully, and made him quite unable to"
682,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"move forward or backward. Besides, he had completely lost his road, and"
683,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,did not know which way to turn toward that despised home which it was
684,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,now his only desire again to reach. The storm lasted till the approach
685,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"of night; and it was as much as he could do, benumbed and weary as he"
686,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"was, to crawl to the hollow of a rock at some distance, which was the"
687,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,best lodging he could find for the night. His provisions were spent; so
688,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"that, hungry and shivering, he crept into the farthest corner of the"
689,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"cavern, and rolling himself up, with his bushy tail over his back, he"
690,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"got a little sleep, though disturbed by the cold, and the shrill"
691,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,whistling of the wind among the stones.
692,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,
693,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"The morning broke over the distant tops of the mountains, when squirrel,"
694,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"half frozen and famished, came out of his lodging, and advanced, as well"
695,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"as he could, toward the brow of the hill, that he might discover which"
696,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"way to take. As he was slowly creeping along, a hungry kite, soaring in"
697,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"the air above, descried him, and making a stoop carried him off in her"
698,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"talons. Poor squirrel, losing his senses with the fright, was borne away"
699,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"with vast rapidity, and seemed inevitably doomed to become food for the"
700,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"kite’s young ones: when an eagle, who had seen the kite seize her prey,"
701,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"pursued her in order to take it from her; and overtaking her, gave her"
702,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"such a buffet, as caused her to drop the squirrel in order to defend"
703,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"herself. The poor animal kept falling through the air a long time, till"
704,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"at last he alighted in the midst of a thick tree, the leaves and tender"
705,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"boughs of which so broke his fall, that, though stunned and breathless,"
706,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"he escaped without material injury, and after lying a while, came to"
707,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"himself again. But what was his pleasure and surprise, to find himself"
708,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"in the very tree which contained his nest. “Ah!” said he, “my dear"
709,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,"native place and peaceful home! if ever I am again tempted to leave you,"
710,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,may I undergo a second time all the miseries and dangers from which I
711,THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.,have now so wonderfully escaped.”

726,ON THE MARTEN.,"“Look up, my dear,” said his papa to Little William, “at those"
727,ON THE MARTEN.,"birds’nests above the chamber-windows, beneath the eaves of the house."
728,ON THE MARTEN.,"Some, you see, are just begun—nothing but a little clay stuck against"
729,ON THE MARTEN.,the wall. Others are half finished; and others are quite built—close and
730,ON THE MARTEN.,tight—leaving nothing but a small hole for the birds to come in and go
731,ON THE MARTEN.,out at.”
732,ON THE MARTEN.,
733,ON THE MARTEN.,“What are they?” said William.
734,ON THE MARTEN.,
735,ON THE MARTEN.,"“They are martens’ nests,” replied his father; “and there you see the"
736,ON THE MARTEN.,"owners. How busily they fly backward and forward, bringing clay and dirt"
737,ON THE MARTEN.,"in their bills, and laying it upon their work, forming it into shape"
738,ON THE MARTEN.,"with their bills and feet! The nests are built very strong and thick,"
739,ON THE MARTEN.,"like a mud wall, and are lined with feathers to make a soft bed for the"
740,ON THE MARTEN.,"young. Martens are a kind of swallows. They feed on flies, gnats, and"
741,ON THE MARTEN.,other insects; and always build in towns and villages about the houses.
742,ON THE MARTEN.,"People do not molest them, for they do good rather than harm, and it is"
743,ON THE MARTEN.,very amusing to view their manners and actions. See how swiftly they
744,ON THE MARTEN.,skim through the air in pursuit of their prey! In the morning they are
745,ON THE MARTEN.,"up by daybreak, and twitter about your window while you are asleep in"
746,ON THE MARTEN.,"bed; and all day long they are upon the wing, getting food for"
747,ON THE MARTEN.,"themselves and their young. As soon as they have caught a few flies,"
748,ON THE MARTEN.,"they hasten to their nests, pop into the hole, and feed their little"
749,ON THE MARTEN.,ones. I’ll tell you a story about the great care they take of their
750,ON THE MARTEN.,young. A pair of martens once built their nest in a porch; and when they
751,ON THE MARTEN.,"had young ones, it happened that one of them climbing up to the hole"
752,ON THE MARTEN.,"before he was fledged, fell out, and, lighting upon the stones, was"
753,ON THE MARTEN.,"killed. The old birds, perceiving this accident, went and got short bits"
754,ON THE MARTEN.,"of strong straw, and stuck them with mud, like palisades, all round the"
755,ON THE MARTEN.,"hole of the nest, in order to keep the other little ones from tumbling"
756,ON THE MARTEN.,after their poor brother.”
757,ON THE MARTEN.,
758,ON THE MARTEN.,“How cunning that was!” cried William.
759,ON THE MARTEN.,
760,ON THE MARTEN.,"“Yes,” said his father; “and I can tell you another story of their"
761,ON THE MARTEN.,"sagacity, and also of their disposition to help one another. A saucy"
762,ON THE MARTEN.,cock-sparrow (you know what impudent rogues they are!) had got into a
763,ON THE MARTEN.,"marten’s nest while the owner was abroad; and when he returned, the"
764,ON THE MARTEN.,sparrow put his head out of the hole and pecked at the marten with open
765,ON THE MARTEN.,"bill, as he attempted to enter his own house. The poor marten was sadly"
766,ON THE MARTEN.,"provoked at this injustice, but was unable by his own strength to right"
767,ON THE MARTEN.,"himself. So he flew away and gathered a number of his companions, who"
768,ON THE MARTEN.,"all came with bits of clay in their bills, with which they plastered up"
769,ON THE MARTEN.,"the hole of the nest, and kept the sparrow in prison, who died miserably"
770,ON THE MARTEN.,for want of food and air.”
771,ON THE MARTEN.,
772,ON THE MARTEN.,"“He was rightly served,” said William."
773,ON THE MARTEN.,
774,ON THE MARTEN.,"“So he was,” rejoined his papa. “Well; I have more to say about the"
775,ON THE MARTEN.,"sagacity of these birds. In autumn, when it begins to be cold weather,"
776,ON THE MARTEN.,"the other swallows assemble upon the roofs of high buildings, and"
777,ON THE MARTEN.,prepare for their departure to a warmer country; for as all the insects
778,ON THE MARTEN.,"here die in the winter, they would have nothing to live on if they were"
779,ON THE MARTEN.,"to stay. They take several short flights in flocks round and round, in"
780,ON THE MARTEN.,"order to try their strength, and then on some fine calm day, they set"
781,ON THE MARTEN.,"out together for a long journey southward, over sea and land, to a very"
782,ON THE MARTEN.,distant country.”
783,ON THE MARTEN.,
784,ON THE MARTEN.,“But how do they find their way?” said William.
785,ON THE MARTEN.,
786,ON THE MARTEN.,"“We say,” answered his father, “that they are taught by _instinct_; that"
787,ON THE MARTEN.,"is, God has implanted in their minds a desire of travelling at the"
788,ON THE MARTEN.,"season which he knows to be proper, and has also given them an impulse"
789,ON THE MARTEN.,to take the right road. They steer their course through the wide air
790,ON THE MARTEN.,"directly to the proper spot. Sometimes, however, storms and contrary"
791,ON THE MARTEN.,winds meet them and drive the poor birds about till they are quite spent
792,ON THE MARTEN.,"and fall into the sea, unless they happen to meet with a ship, on which"
793,ON THE MARTEN.,they can light and rest themselves. The swallows from this country are
794,ON THE MARTEN.,"supposed to go as far as the middle of Africa to spend the winter, where"
795,ON THE MARTEN.,"the weather is always warm, and insects are to be met with all the year."
796,ON THE MARTEN.,In spring they take another long journey back again to these northern
797,ON THE MARTEN.,"countries. Sometimes, when we have fine weather very early, a few of"
798,ON THE MARTEN.,"them come too soon; for when it changes to frost and snow again, the"
799,ON THE MARTEN.,"poor creatures are starved for want of food, or perish from the cold."
800,ON THE MARTEN.,"Hence arises the proverb,"
801,ON THE MARTEN.,
802,ON THE MARTEN.,‘One swallow does not make a summer.’
803,ON THE MARTEN.,
804,ON THE MARTEN.,"But when a great many of them are come, we may be sure that winter is"
805,ON THE MARTEN.,"over, so that we are always very glad to see them again. The martens"
806,ON THE MARTEN.,find their way back over a great length of sea and land to the very same
807,ON THE MARTEN.,villages and houses where they were bred. This has been discovered by
808,ON THE MARTEN.,"catching some of them, and marking them. They repair their old nests, or"
809,ON THE MARTEN.,"build new ones, and then set about laying eggs and hatching their young."
810,ON THE MARTEN.,"Pretty things! I hope you will never knock down their nests, or take"
811,ON THE MARTEN.,"their eggs or young ones! for, as they come such a long way to visit us,"
812,ON THE MARTEN.,"and lodge in our houses without fear, we ought to use them kindly.”"

870,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"ice, which was in the rivers, melt away when she breathes upon them. The"
871,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"young lambs frisk about her, and the birds warble in their little"
872,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"throats to welcome her coming; and when they see her, they begin to"
873,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"choose their mates, and to build their nests. Youths and maidens have"
874,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"you seen this beautiful Virgin? If you have, tell me who she is, and"
875,THE MASK OF NATURE.,what is her name.
876,THE MASK OF NATURE.,
877,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"Who is this that cometh from the south, thinly clad in a light"
878,THE MASK OF NATURE.,transparent garment; her breath is hot and sultry; she seeks the
879,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"refreshment of the cool shade; she seeks the clear streams, and crystal"
880,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"brooks, to bathe her languid limbs? The brooks and rivulets fly from"
881,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"her, and are dried up at her approach. She cools her parched lips with"
882,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"berries, and the grateful acid of all fruits,—the seedy melon, the sharp"
883,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"apple, and the red pulp of the juicy cherry, which are poured out"
884,THE MASK OF NATURE.,plentifully around her. The tanned haymakers welcome her coming; and the
885,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"sheepshearer, who clips the fleeces off his flock with his sounding"
886,THE MASK OF NATURE.,shears. When she cometh let me lie under the thick shade of a spreading
887,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"beach-tree—let me walk with her in the early morning, when the dew is"
888,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"yet upon the grass—let me wander with her in the soft twilight, when the"
889,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"shepherd shuts his fold, and the star of evening appears. Who is she"
890,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"that cometh from the south? Youths and maidens, tell me, if you know,"
891,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"who she is, and what is her name."
892,THE MASK OF NATURE.,
893,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"Who is he that cometh with sober pace, stealing upon us unawares? His"
894,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"garments are red with the blood of the grape, and his temples are bound"
895,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"with a sheaf of ripe wheat. His hair is thin and begins to fall, and the"
896,THE MASK OF NATURE.,auburn is mixed with mournful gray. He shakes the brown nuts from the
897,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"tree. He winds the horn, and calls the hunters to their sport. The gun"
898,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"sounds:—the trembling partridge and the beautiful pheasant flutter,"
899,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"bleeding in the air, and fall dead at the sportsman’s feet. Who is he"
900,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"that is crowned with a wheat-sheaf? Youths and maidens, tell me, if you"

902,THE MASK OF NATURE.,
903,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"Who is he that cometh from the north, clothed in furs and warm wool? He"

905,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"sharp icicles. He loves the blazing fire high piled upon the hearth, and"
906,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"the wine sparkling in the glass. He binds skates to his feet, and skims"
907,THE MASK OF NATURE.,"over the frozen lakes. His breath is piercing and cold, and no little"

909,THE MASK OF NATURE.,Whatever he touches turns to ice. If he were to stroke you with his cold

944,JOURNAL.,_June 10th._ Last night we had a dreadful alarm. A violent scream was
945,JOURNAL.,"heard from the henroost; the geese all set up a cackle, and the dogs"
946,JOURNAL.,"barked. Ned, the boy who lies over the stable, jumped up, and ran into"
947,JOURNAL.,"the yard, when he observed a fox galloping away with a chicken in his"
948,JOURNAL.,"mouth, and the dogs in full chase after him. They could not overtake"
949,JOURNAL.,"him, and soon returned. Upon further examination, the large white cock"
950,JOURNAL.,"was found lying on the ground, all bloody, with his comb torn almost"
951,JOURNAL.,"off, and his feathers all ruffled, and the speckled hen and three"
952,JOURNAL.,"chickens lay dead beside him. The cock recovered, but appeared terribly"
953,JOURNAL.,"frightened. It seems that the fox had jumped over the garden-hedge, and"
954,JOURNAL.,"then crossing part of the yard behind the straw, had crept into the"
955,JOURNAL.,"henroost through a broken pale. John the carpenter was sent for, to make"
956,JOURNAL.,"all fast, and prevent the like mischief again."
957,JOURNAL.,
958,JOURNAL.,Early this morning the brindled cow was delivered of a fine bull-calf.
959,JOURNAL.,Both are likely to do well. The calf is to be fattened for the butcher.
960,JOURNAL.,
961,JOURNAL.,"The duck-eggs that were sat upon by the old black hen, were hatched this"
962,JOURNAL.,"day, and the ducklings all directly ran into the pond, to the great"
963,JOURNAL.,"terror of the hen, who went round and round, clucking with all her might"
964,JOURNAL.,"in order to call them out, but they did not regard her. An old drake"
965,JOURNAL.,"took the little ones under his care, and they swam about very merrily."
966,JOURNAL.,
967,JOURNAL.,As Dolly this morning was milking the new cow that was bought at the
968,JOURNAL.,"fair, she kicked with her hind legs, and threw down the milk-pail, at"
969,JOURNAL.,the same time knocking Dolly off her stool into the dirt. For this
970,JOURNAL.,"offence the cow was sentenced to have her head fastened to the rack, and"
971,JOURNAL.,her legs tied together.
972,JOURNAL.,
973,JOURNAL.,A kite was observed to hover a long while over the yard with an
974,JOURNAL.,"intention of carrying off some of the young chickens, but the hens"
975,JOURNAL.,"called their broods together under their wings, and the cocks put"
976,JOURNAL.,"themselves in order of battle, so that the kite was disappointed. At"
977,JOURNAL.,"length, one chicken, not minding its mother, but straggling heedlessly"
978,JOURNAL.,"to a distance, was descried by the kite, who made a sudden swoop, and"
979,JOURNAL.,"seized it in his talons. The chicken cried out, and the cocks and hens"
980,JOURNAL.,"all screamed; when Ralph, the farmer’s son, who saw the attack, snatched"
981,JOURNAL.,"up a loaded gun, and just as the kite was flying off with his prey,"
982,JOURNAL.,"fired and brought him dead to the ground, along with the poor chicken,"
983,JOURNAL.,who was killed in the fall. The dead body of the kite was nailed up
984,JOURNAL.,"against the wall, by way of a warning to his wicked comrades."
985,JOURNAL.,
986,JOURNAL.,"In the forenoon we were alarmed with strange noises approaching us, and"
987,JOURNAL.,"looking out we saw a number of people with frying-pans, warming-pans,"
988,JOURNAL.,"tongs, and pokers, beating, ringing, and making all possible din. We"
989,JOURNAL.,"soon discovered them to be our neighbours of the next farm, in pursuit"
990,JOURNAL.,of a swarm of bees which was hovering in the air over their heads. The
991,JOURNAL.,"bees at length alighted on the tall pear-tree in our orchard, and hung"
992,JOURNAL.,"in a bunch from one of the boughs. A ladder was got, and a man"
993,JOURNAL.,"ascending, with gloves on his hands, and an apron tied over his head,"
994,JOURNAL.,swept them into a hive which was rubbed on the inside with honey and
995,JOURNAL.,"sweet herbs. But as he was descending, some bees, which had got under"
996,JOURNAL.,"his gloves, stung him in such a manner, that he hastily threw down the"
997,JOURNAL.,"hive, upon which the greater part of the bees fell out, and began in a"
998,JOURNAL.,"rage to fly among the crowd, and sting all whom they lit upon. Away"
999,JOURNAL.,"scampered the people, the women shrieking, the children roaring; and"
1000,JOURNAL.,"poor Adam, who had held the hive, was assailed so furiously, that he was"
1001,JOURNAL.,"obliged to throw himself on the ground, and creep under the"
1002,JOURNAL.,"gooseberry-bushes. At length, the bees began to return to the hive, in"
1003,JOURNAL.,"which the queen-bee had remained; and after a while, all being quietly"
1004,JOURNAL.,"settled, a cloth was thrown over it, and the swarm was carried home."
1005,JOURNAL.,
1006,JOURNAL.,"About noon, three pigs broke into the garden, where they were rioting"
1007,JOURNAL.,"upon the carrots and turnips, and doing a great deal of mischief by"
1008,JOURNAL.,"trampling the beds and rooting up the plants with their snouts, when"
1009,JOURNAL.,"they were spied by old Towzer the mastiff, who ran among them, and"
1010,JOURNAL.,"laying hold of their long ears with his teeth, made them squeal most"
1011,JOURNAL.,"dismally, and get out of the garden as fast as they could."
1012,JOURNAL.,
1013,JOURNAL.,"Roger the ploughman, when he came for his dinner, brought word that he"
1014,JOURNAL.,had discovered a partridge’s nest with sixteen eggs in the home-field.
1015,JOURNAL.,"Upon which the farmer went out and broke them all; saying, that he did"
1016,JOURNAL.,"not choose to rear birds upon his corn, which he was not allowed to"
1017,JOURNAL.,"catch, but must leave to some qualified sportsman, who would besides"
1018,JOURNAL.,break down his fences in the pursuit.
1019,JOURNAL.,
1020,JOURNAL.,"A sheep-washing was held this day at the mill-pool, when seven-score"
1021,JOURNAL.,"were well washed, and then penned in the high meadow to dry. Many of"
1022,JOURNAL.,them made great resistance at being thrown into the water; and the old
1023,JOURNAL.,"ram being dragged to the brink by a boy at each horn, and a third"
1024,JOURNAL.,"pushing behind, by a sudden spring threw two of them into the water, to"
1025,JOURNAL.,the great diversion of the spectators.
1026,JOURNAL.,
1027,JOURNAL.,"Toward the dusk of the evening, the squire’s mongrel greyhound, which"
1028,JOURNAL.,"had been long suspected of worrying sheep, was caught in the fact. He"
1029,JOURNAL.,"had killed two lambs, and was making a hearty meal upon one of them,"
1030,JOURNAL.,"when he was disturbed by the approach of the shepherd’s boy, and"
1031,JOURNAL.,directly leaped the hedge and made off. The dead bodies were taken to
1032,JOURNAL.,"the squire’s, with an endictment of wilful murder against the dog. But"
1033,JOURNAL.,"when they came to look for the culprit, he was not to be found in any"
1034,JOURNAL.,"part of the premises, and is supposed to have fled his country through"
1035,JOURNAL.,consciousness of his heinous offence.
1036,JOURNAL.,
1037,JOURNAL.,"Joseph, who sleeps in the garret at the old end of the house, after"
1038,JOURNAL.,"having been some time in bed, came down stairs in his shirt, as pale as"
1039,JOURNAL.,"ashes, and frightened the maids, who were going up. It was some time"
1040,JOURNAL.,"before he could tell what was the matter; at length, he said he had"
1041,JOURNAL.,"heard some dreadful noises overhead, which he was sure must be made by"
1042,JOURNAL.,"some ghost or evil spirit; nay, he thought he had seen something moving,"
1043,JOURNAL.,though he owned he durst hardly lift up his eyes. He concluded with
1044,JOURNAL.,"declaring, that he would rather sit up all night in the kitchen than go"
1045,JOURNAL.,"to his room again. The maids were almost as much alarmed as he, and did"
1046,JOURNAL.,"not know what to do; but their master overhearing their talk, came out"
1047,JOURNAL.,"and insisted upon their accompanying him to the spot, in order to search"
1048,JOURNAL.,"into the affair. They all went into the garret, and for a while heard"
1049,JOURNAL.,"nothing; when their master ordered the candle to be taken away, and"
1050,JOURNAL.,every one to keep quite still. Joseph and the maids stuck close to each
1051,JOURNAL.,"other, and trembled every limb. At length, a kind of groaning or snoring"
1052,JOURNAL.,"began to be heard, which grew louder and louder, with intervals of a"
1053,JOURNAL.,"strange sort of hissing. “That’s it!” whispered Joseph, drawing back"
1054,JOURNAL.,"toward the door—the maids were ready to sink, and even the farmer"
1055,JOURNAL.,himself was a little disconcerted. The noise seemed to come from the
1056,JOURNAL.,rafters near the thatch. In a while a glimpse of moonlight shining
1057,JOURNAL.,"through a hole at the place, plainly discovered the shadow of something"
1058,JOURNAL.,"stirring; and on looking intently, something like feathers was"
1059,JOURNAL.,perceived. The farmer now began to suspect what the case was; and
1060,JOURNAL.,"ordering up a short ladder bid Joseph climb to the spot, and thrust his"
1061,JOURNAL.,"hand into the hole. This he did rather unwillingly, and soon drew it"
1062,JOURNAL.,"back, crying loudly that he was bit. However, gathering courage, he put"
1063,JOURNAL.,"it in again, and pulled out a large white owl, another at the same time"
1064,JOURNAL.,being heard to fly away. The cause of the alarm was now made clear
1065,JOURNAL.,"enough; and poor Joseph, after being heartily jeered by the maids,"
1066,JOURNAL.,"though they had been as much frightened as he, sneaked into bed, and the"
1067,JOURNAL.,house soon became quiet.

1156,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,
1157,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,
1158,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,A large old house in the country was so extremely infested with rats
1159,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,that nothing could be secured from their depredations. They scaled the
1160,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"walls to attack flitches of bacon, though hung as high as the ceiling."
1161,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,Hanging shelves afforded no protection to the cheese and pastry. They
1162,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"penetrated by sap into the store-room, and plundered it of preserves and"
1163,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"sweetmeats. They gnawed through cupboard-doors, undermined floors, and"
1164,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,ran races behind the wainscots. The cats could not get at them; they
1165,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,were too cunning and too well fed to meddle with poison; and traps only
1166,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"now and then caught a heedless straggler. One of these, however, on"
1167,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"being taken, was the occasion of practising a new device. This was, to"
1168,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"fasten a collar with a small bell about the prisoner’s neck, and then"
1169,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,turn him loose again.
1170,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,
1171,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"Overjoyed at the recovery of his liberty, the rat ran into the nearest"
1172,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"hole, and went in search of his companions. They heard at a distance the"
1173,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"bell tinkle-tinkle through the dark passages, and suspecting some enemy"
1174,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"had got among them, away they scoured, some one way and some another."
1175,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"The bell-bearer pursued; and soon guessing the cause of their flight, he"
1176,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"was greatly amused by it. Wherever he approached, it was all"
1177,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"hurry-scurry, and not a tail of one of them was to be seen. He chased"
1178,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"his old friends from hole to hole, and room to room, laughing all the"
1179,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"while at their fears, and increasing them by all the means in his power."
1180,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"Presently, he had the whole house to himself. “That’s right,” quoth he,"

1183,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,
1184,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,For two or three days this course of life went on very pleasantly. He

1187,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"again upon the former footing. But the difficulty was, how to get rid of"
1188,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"his bell. He pulled and tugged with his fore-feet, and almost wore the"
1189,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"skin off his neck in the attempt, but all in vain. The bell was now his"
1190,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,plague and torment. He wandered from room to room earnestly desiring to
1191,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"make himself known to one of his companions, but they all kept out of"
1192,THE RAT WITH A BELL.—A FABLE.,"his reach. At last, as he was moping about disconsolate he fell in"

1297,THE KID.,"One bleak day in March, _Sylvia_, returning from a visit to the"
1298,THE KID.,"sheepfold, met with a young kidling deserted by its dam on the naked"
1299,THE KID.,"heath. It was bleating piteously, and was so benumbed with the cold that"
1300,THE KID.,"it could scarcely stand. Sylvia took it up in her arms, and pressed it"
1301,THE KID.,"close to her bosom. She hastened home, and showing her little foundling"
1302,THE KID.,"to her parents, begged she might rear it for her own. They consented;"
1303,THE KID.,"and Sylvia immediately got a basketful of clean straw, and made a bed"
1304,THE KID.,"for him on the hearth. She warmed some milk, and held it to him in a"
1305,THE KID.,"platter The poor creature drank it up eagerly, and then licked her hand"
1306,THE KID.,for more. _Sylvia_ was delighted. She chafed his tender legs with her
1307,THE KID.,"warm hands, and soon saw him jump out of his basket and frisk across the"
1308,THE KID.,"room. When full, he lay down again, and took a comfortable nap."
1309,THE KID.,
1310,THE KID.,"The next day, the kid had a name bestowed upon him. As he gave tokens of"
1311,THE KID.,"being an excellent jumper, it was _Capriole_. He was introduced to all"
1312,THE KID.,"the rest of the family, and the younger children were allowed to stroke"
1313,THE KID.,and pat him; but Sylvia would let nobody be intimate with him out
1314,THE KID.,"herself. The great mastiff was charged not to hurt him, and indeed, he"
1315,THE KID.,had no intention to do it.
1316,THE KID.,
1317,THE KID.,"Within a few days, Capriole followed Sylvia all about the house; trotted"
1318,THE KID.,by her side into the yard; ran races with her in the home-field; fed out
1319,THE KID.,"of her hand; and was declared pet and favourite. As the spring advanced,"
1320,THE KID.,"Sylvia roamed in the fields, and gathered wild flowers, with which she"
1321,THE KID.,"wove garlands, and hung them round the kid’s neck. He could not be kept,"
1322,THE KID.,"however, from munching his finery when he could reach it with his mouth."
1323,THE KID.,He was likewise rather troublesome in thrusting his nose into the
1324,THE KID.,"meal-tub and flour-box, and following people into the dairy, and sipping"
1325,THE KID.,the milk that was set for cream. He now and then got a blow for his
1326,THE KID.,"intrusion; but his mistress always took his part, and indulged him in"
1327,THE KID.,every liberty.
1328,THE KID.,
1329,THE KID.,"Capriole’s horns now began to bud, and a little white beard sprouted at"
1330,THE KID.,the end of his chin. He grew bold enough to put himself into a fighting
1331,THE KID.,posture whenever he was offended. He butted down little Colin into the
1332,THE KID.,dirt; quarrelled with the geese for their allowance of corn; and held
1333,THE KID.,"many a stout battle with the old turkey-cock. Everybody said, “Capriole"
1334,THE KID.,"is growing too saucy; he must be sent away, or taught better manners.”"
1335,THE KID.,"But Sylvia still stood his friend, and he repaid her love with many"
1336,THE KID.,tender caresses.
1337,THE KID.,
1338,THE KID.,"The farmhouse where Sylvia lived was situated in a sweet valley, by the"
1339,THE KID.,side of a clear stream bordered with trees. Above the house rose a
1340,THE KID.,"sloping meadow, and beyond that, was an open common covered with purple"
1341,THE KID.,"heath and yellow furze. Farther on, at some distance, rose a steep hill,"
1342,THE KID.,"the summit of which was a bare craggy rock, scarcely accessible to human"
1343,THE KID.,"feet. Capriole, ranging at his pleasure, often got upon the common, and"
1344,THE KID.,was pleased with browsing the short grass and wild herbs which grew
1345,THE KID.,"there. Still, however, when his mistress came to see him, he would run"
1346,THE KID.,bounding at her call and accompany her back to the farm.
1347,THE KID.,
1348,THE KID.,"One fine summer’s day, Sylvia, after having finished the business of the"
1349,THE KID.,"morning, wanted to play with her kid; and missing him, she went to the"
1350,THE KID.,"side of the common, and called aloud, “Capriole! Capriole!” expecting to"
1351,THE KID.,see him come running to her as usual. No Capriole came. She went on and
1352,THE KID.,"on, still calling her kid with the most endearing accents; but nothing"
1353,THE KID.,was to be seen of him. Her heart began to flutter. “What can be come of
1354,THE KID.,him? Surely somebody must have stolen him; or perhaps the neighbours’
1355,THE KID.,"dogs have worried him. Oh, my poor Capriole! my dear Capriole! I shall"
1356,THE KID.,never see you again!” and Sylvia began to weep.
1357,THE KID.,
1358,THE KID.,"She still went on, looking wistfully all around, and making the place"
1359,THE KID.,"echo with “Capriole! Capriole! where are you, my Capriole?” till, at"
1360,THE KID.,"length, she came to the foot of the steep hill. She climbed up its sides"
1361,THE KID.,to get a better view. No kid was to be seen. She sat down and wept and
1362,THE KID.,wrung her hands. After a while she fancied she heard a bleating like the
1363,THE KID.,"well-known voice of her Capriole. She started up, and looked toward the"
1364,THE KID.,"sound, which seemed a great way overhead. At length, she spied, just on"
1365,THE KID.,"the edge of a steep crag, her Capriole peeping over. She stretched out"
1366,THE KID.,"her hands to him, and began to call, but with a timid voice, lest in his"
1367,THE KID.,"impatience to return to her, he should leap down and break his neck. But"
1368,THE KID.,there was no such danger. Capriole was inhaling the fresh breeze of the
1369,THE KID.,"mountains, and enjoying with rapture the scenes for which nature"
1370,THE KID.,"designed him. His bleating was the expression of joy, and he bestowed"
1371,THE KID.,"not a thought on his kind mistress, nor paid the least attention to her"
1372,THE KID.,"call. Sylvia ascended as high as she could toward him, and called louder"
1373,THE KID.,"and louder, but all in vain. Capriole leaped from rock to rock, cropped"
1374,THE KID.,"the fine herbage in the clefts, and was quite lost in the pleasure of"
1375,THE KID.,his new existence.
1376,THE KID.,
1377,THE KID.,"Poor Sylvia stayed till she was tired, and then returned disconsolate to"
1378,THE KID.,"the farm, to relate her misfortune. She got her brothers to accompany"
1379,THE KID.,"her back to the hill, and took with her a slice of white bread and some"
1380,THE KID.,"milk to tempt the little wanderer home. But he had mounted still higher,"
1381,THE KID.,"and had joined a herd of companions of the same species, with whom he"
1382,THE KID.,was frisking and sporting. He had neither eyes nor ears for his old
1383,THE KID.,"friends of the valley. All former habits were broken at once, and he had"
1384,THE KID.,"commenced free commoner of nature. Sylvia came back crying, as much from"
1385,THE KID.,"vexation as sorrow. “The little ungrateful thing,” said she; “so well as"
1386,THE KID.,"I loved him, and so kindly as I treated him, to desert me in this way at"
1387,THE KID.,last!—But he was always a rover.”
1388,THE KID.,
1389,THE KID.,"“Take care, then, Sylvia,” said her mother, “how you set your heart upon"
1390,THE KID.,_rovers_ again!”

1400,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,delicious supper shall I have!” said he to himself. “This piece of kid
1401,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"well stewed down, with my onions sliced, thickened with my meal, and"
1402,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"seasoned with my salt and pepper, will make a dish for the bishop of the"

1405,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,
1406,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"A noise in the hedge now attracted his notice, and he spied a squirrel"

1408,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"“Ha!” thought he, “what a nice present a nest of young squirrels will be"
1409,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"to my little master! I’ll try if I can get it.” Upon this, he set down"
1410,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"his basket in the road, and began to climb the tree. He had half"
1411,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"ascended, when casting a look at his basket, he saw a dog with his nose"
1412,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"in it, ferreting out the piece of kid’s flesh. He made all possible"
1413,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"speed down, but the dog was too quick for him, and ran off with the meat"
1414,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"in his mouth. Robinet looked after him. “Well,” said he, “then I must be"
1415,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,contented with soupe maigre—and no bad thing neither.”
1416,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,
1417,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"He travelled on, and came to a little public-house by the roadside,"
1418,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,where an acquaintance of his was sitting on a bench drinking. He invited
1419,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"Robinet to take a draught. Robinet seated himself by his friend, and set"
1420,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"his basket on the bench close by him. A tame raven, which was kept at"
1421,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"the house, came slyly behind him, and perching on the basket, stole away"
1422,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"the bag in which the meal was tied up, and hopped off with it to his"
1423,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,hole. Robinet did not perceive the theft till he had got on his way
1424,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"again. He returned to search for his bag, but could hear no tidings of"
1425,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"it. “Well,” says he, “my soup will be the thinner; but I will boil a"
1426,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"slice of bread with it, and that will do it some good at least.”"
1427,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,
1428,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"He went on again, and arrived at a little brook, over which was laid a"
1429,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"narrow plank. A young woman coming up to pass at the same time, Robinet"
1430,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"gallantly offered his hand. As soon as she was got to the middle, either"
1431,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"through fear or sport, she shrieked out, and cried she was falling."
1432,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"Robinet hastening to support her with his other hand, let his basket"
1433,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"drop into the stream. As soon as she was safe over, he jumped in and"
1434,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,recovered it; but when he took it out he perceived that all the salt was
1435,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"melted, and the pepper washed away. Nothing was now left but the onions."
1436,HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.,"“Well!” says Robinet, “then I must sup to-night upon roasted onions and"

1447,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"Juliet was a clever, well-disposed girl, but apt to be heedless. She"
1448,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"could learn her lessons very well, but commonly as much time was taken"
1449,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,up in getting her things together as in doing what she was set about. If
1450,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"she was at work, there was generally the housewife to seek in one place,"
1451,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,and the thread-papers in another. The scissors were left in her pocket
1452,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"upstairs, and the thimble was rolling about the floor. In writing, the"
1453,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"copybook was generally missing, the ink dried up, and the pens, new and"
1454,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"old, all tumbled about the cupboard. The slate and slate-pencil were"
1455,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"never found together. In making her exercises, the English dictionary"
1456,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,always came to hand instead of the French grammar; and when she was to
1457,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"read a chapter, she usually got hold of Robinson Crusoe, or the World"

1460,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"Juliet’s mamma was almost tired of teaching her, so she sent her to make"
1461,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"a visit to an old lady in the country, a very good woman, but rather"
1462,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,strict with young folks. Here she was shut up in a room above stairs by
1463,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"herself after breakfast every day, till she had quite finished the tasks"
1464,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,set her. This house was one of the very few that are still haunted by
1465,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"fairies. One of these, whose name was _Disorder_, took a pleasure in"
1466,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"plaguing poor Juliet. She was a frightful figure to look at, being"
1467,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"crooked and squint-eyed, with her hair hanging about her face, and her"
1468,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"dress put on all awry, and full of rents and tatters. She prevailed on"
1469,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,the old lady to let her set Juliet her tasks; so one morning she came up
1470,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"with a workbag full of threads of silk of all sorts of colours, mixed"
1471,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"and entangled together, and a flower very nicely worked to copy. It was"
1472,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"a pansy, and the gradual melting of its hues into one another was"
1473,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"imitated with great accuracy and beauty. “Here, miss,” said she, “my"

1475,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,it done before you come down to dinner. You will find all the materials

1477,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1478,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"Juliet took the flower and the bag, and turned out all the silks upon"

1480,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"yellow, and at length fixed upon one to begin working with. After taking"
1481,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"two or three stitches, and looking at her model, she found another shade"
1482,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"was wanted. This was to be hunted out from the bunch, and a long while"
1483,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,it took her to find it. It was soon necessary to change it for another.
1484,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"Juliet saw that, in going on at this rate, it would take days instead of"

1486,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"After this had continued some time, she was startled at the sound of"

1492,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"be a good girl in the main, I am come to your assistance. My name is"
1493,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"_Order_: your mamma is well acquainted with me, though this is the first"
1494,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,time you ever saw me; but I hope we shall know one another better for
1495,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"the future.” She then jumped upon the table, and with a wand gave a tap"
1496,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"upon the heap of entangled silk.—Immediately the threads separated, and"
1497,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"arranged themselves in a long row consisting of little skeins, in which"
1498,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"all of the same colour were collected together, those approaching"
1499,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"nearest in shade being placed next each other. This done, she"
1500,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"disappeared. Juliet, as soon as her surprise was over, resumed her work,"
1501,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,and found it go on with ease and pleasure. She finished the flower by
1502,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"dinner-time, and obtained great praise for the neatness of the"
1503,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,execution.
1504,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1505,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"The next day the ill-natured fairy came up, with a great book under her"
1506,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"arm. “This,” said she, “is my mistress’s house-book, and she says you"
1507,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,must draw out against dinner an exact account of what it has cost her
1508,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"last year in all the articles of housekeeping, including clothes, rent,"
1509,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"taxes, wages, and the like. You must state separately the amount of"
1510,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"every article, under the heads of baker, butcher, milliner, shoemaker,"
1511,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"and so forth, taking special care not to miss a single thing entered"
1512,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,down in the book. Here is a quire of paper and a parcel of pens.” So
1513,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"saying, with a malicious grin, she left her."
1514,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1515,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,Julia turned pale at the very thought of the task she had to perform.
1516,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"She opened the great book, and saw all the pages closely written, but in"
1517,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"the most confused manner possible. Here was, “Paid Mr. Crusty for a"
1518,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"week’s bread and baking” so much. Then, “Paid Mr. Pinchtoe for shoes,”"
1519,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"so much. “Paid half a year’s rent,” so much. Then came a butcher’s bill,"
1520,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"succeeded by a milliner’s, and that by a tallow-chandler’s. “What shall"
1521,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"I do?” cried poor Juliet—“where am I to begin, and how can I possibly"
1522,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"pick out all these things? Was ever such a tedious, perplexing task? O"
1523,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,that my good little creature were here again with her wand!”
1524,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1525,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,She had but just uttered these words when the fairy Order stood before
1526,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"her. “Don’t be startled, my dear,” said she; “I knew your wish, and made"
1527,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,haste to comply with it. Let me see your book.” She turned over a few
1528,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"leaves, and then cried, “I see my crossgrained sister has played you a"
1529,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,trick. She has brought you the _daybook_ instead of the _leger_; but I
1530,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"will set the matter to rights instantly.” She vanished, and presently"
1531,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"returned with another book, in which she showed Juliet every one of the"
1532,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"articles required, standing at the tops of the pages, and all the"
1533,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,particulars entered under them from the daybook; so that there was
1534,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"nothing for her to do but cast up the sums, and copy out the heads with"
1535,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"their amount in single lines. As Juliet was a ready accountant, she was"
1536,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"not long in finishing the business, and produced her account neatly"
1537,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"written on one sheet of paper, at dinner."
1538,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1539,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"The next day, Juliet’s tormentor brought her up a large box full of"
1540,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"letters stamped upon small bits of ivory, capitals and common letters of"
1541,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"all sorts, but jumbled together promiscuously, as if they had been"
1542,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"shaken in a bag. “Now, miss,” said she, “before you come down to dinner,"
1543,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"you must exactly copy out this poem in these ivory letters, placing them"
1544,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,line by line on the floor of your room.”
1545,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1546,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,Juliet thought at first that this task would be pretty sport enough; but
1547,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"when she set about it, she found such trouble in hunting out the letters"
1548,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"she wanted, every one seeming to come to hand before the right one, that"
1549,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"she proceeded very slowly; and the poem being a long one, it was plain"
1550,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,that night would come before it was finished. Sitting down and crying
1551,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"for her kind friend was, therefore, her only resource."
1552,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1553,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"Order was not far distant, for, indeed, she had been watching her"
1554,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"proceedings all the while. She made herself visible, and giving a tap on"
1555,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"the letters with her wand, they immediately arranged themselves"
1556,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"alphabetically in little double heaps, the small in one, and the great"
1557,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"in the other. After this operation, Juliet’s task went on with such"
1558,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"expedition, that she called up the old lady an hour before dinner, to be"
1559,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,witness to its completion.
1560,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1561,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"The good lady kissed her, and told her, that as she hoped she was now"
1562,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"made fully sensible of the benefits of order, and the inconveniences of"
1563,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"disorder, she would not confine her any longer to work by herself at set"
1564,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"tasks, but she should come and sit with her. Juliet took such pains to"
1565,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"please her, by doing everything with the greatest neatness and"
1566,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"regularity, and reforming all her careless habits, that when she was"
1567,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"sent back to her mother, the following presents were made her,"
1568,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,constantly to remind her of the beauty and advantage of order:—
1569,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1570,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"A cabinet of English coins, in which all the gold and silver money of"
1571,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,the kings was arranged in the order of their reigns.
1572,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1573,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,A set of plaster casts of the Roman emperors.
1574,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1575,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"A cabinet of beautiful shells, displayed according to the most approved"
1576,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,system.
1577,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1578,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"A very complete box of water-colours, and another of crayons, sorted in"
1579,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,all the shades of the primary colours.
1580,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,
1581,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"And a very nice housewife, with all the implements belonging to a"
1582,ORDER AND DISORDER.—A FAIRY TALE.,"seamstress, and a good store of the best needles in sizes."

1587,LIVE DOLLS.,LIVE DOLLS.
1588,LIVE DOLLS.,
1589,LIVE DOLLS.,
1590,LIVE DOLLS.,"Mrs. Lacour was accustomed to lay out for her daughter, a girl about"
1591,LIVE DOLLS.,"eight years old, a great deal of money in playthings. One morning Eliza"
1592,LIVE DOLLS.,"(that was her name) was in raptures over a new wax-doll, which her mamma"
1593,LIVE DOLLS.,"had given two guineas for in Fleet street. By means of a concealed wire,"
1594,LIVE DOLLS.,"it had been made to open and shut its eyes, to the no small surprise of"
1595,LIVE DOLLS.,"the little girl, not unmixed with a certain degree of terror, when her"
1596,LIVE DOLLS.,mother first exhibited the phenomenon; but having had the principle
1597,LIVE DOLLS.,"explained to her, she had spent the greatest part of the morning in"
1598,LIVE DOLLS.,"moving the wires up and down, and making them alternately open and shut"
1599,LIVE DOLLS.,"the eyelids. It is true the mechanism had one defect, which we record,"
1600,LIVE DOLLS.,in hopes that the ingenuity of future doll-makers may find a remedy for
1601,LIVE DOLLS.,"it. The doll shut her eyes after the manner of a bird, by drawing up the"
1602,LIVE DOLLS.,"membrane over the eye, instead of letting the eyelid fall over it, as is"
1603,LIVE DOLLS.,the custom in human creatures; but as Eliza had not studied comparative
1604,LIVE DOLLS.,"anatomy, this slight irregularity was not noticed. She was still in"
1605,LIVE DOLLS.,"raptures over her new acquisition, when she was surprised by a visit"
1606,LIVE DOLLS.,"from Mrs. Dorcas, a maiden sister of her father, who sometimes called"
1607,LIVE DOLLS.,"upon her. “Look here, my dear aunt,” said she, “what a charming doll I"
1608,LIVE DOLLS.,"have got; see, now its eyes are shut, now they are open again—how"
1609,LIVE DOLLS.,curious! I dare say you cannot guess how I do it. I can hardly help
1610,LIVE DOLLS.,"fancying it alive. To-morrow I shall begin to dress it, for it must have"
1611,LIVE DOLLS.,"a fine worked cap, with a laced border, and a long muslin robe and"
1612,LIVE DOLLS.,"shoes. I do not know whether it should have shoes yet, for it is only a"
1613,LIVE DOLLS.,"baby; and I shall lay it in the cradle, and rock it; and when I want it"
1614,LIVE DOLLS.,"to go to sleep, its eyes shall be shut, and in the morning they shall be"
1615,LIVE DOLLS.,"open again, just as if it were really alive: I wish it could eat and"
1616,LIVE DOLLS.,drink—why could they not make its mouth to open?”
1617,LIVE DOLLS.,
1618,LIVE DOLLS.,"_Mrs. D._ Your doll is very pretty, indeed, and I commend you for"
1619,LIVE DOLLS.,"intending to make its clothes yourself, but would not you like better to"
1620,LIVE DOLLS.,have a real live doll to dress?
1621,LIVE DOLLS.,
1622,LIVE DOLLS.,"_Eliza._ O yes! that I should, indeed; but I believe—I am afraid there"
1623,LIVE DOLLS.,is no such doll.
1624,LIVE DOLLS.,
1625,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ I will find you such a one if you will dress it.
1626,LIVE DOLLS.,
1627,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ And will it open its mouth and eat?
1628,LIVE DOLLS.,
1629,LIVE DOLLS.,"_Mrs. D._ Yes, it will."
1630,LIVE DOLLS.,
1631,LIVE DOLLS.,"_Eliza._ And can it speak, too?"
1632,LIVE DOLLS.,
1633,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ I do not say it can speak yet; it has not been taught; but you
1634,LIVE DOLLS.,"shall hear its voice, and you shall see it breathe; your doll does not"
1635,LIVE DOLLS.,"breathe. [Eliza took her doll and placed her hand upon its waxen bosom,"
1636,LIVE DOLLS.,as if she expected to feel it heave.] And the clothes you will make will
1637,LIVE DOLLS.,warm it too. A wax-doll is not warmed by its clothes. Your doll is as
1638,LIVE DOLLS.,cold when she is wrapped up in a quilt and placed in the cradle as if
1639,LIVE DOLLS.,she were laid naked upon a marble slab.
1640,LIVE DOLLS.,
1641,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ Is she?
1642,LIVE DOLLS.,
1643,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ Yes; you may convince yourself of that whenever you please;
1644,LIVE DOLLS.,"but this live doll will not only be warmed by the clothes you make, but"
1645,LIVE DOLLS.,perhaps she may die if you do not make them.
1646,LIVE DOLLS.,
1647,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ O! do not let her die—I will set about making the clothes
1648,LIVE DOLLS.,directly.
1649,LIVE DOLLS.,
1650,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ Then come along with me.
1651,LIVE DOLLS.,
1652,LIVE DOLLS.,"Eliza sallied forth with her aunt Dorcas: she was all the way silent,"
1653,LIVE DOLLS.,and breathless with expectation. After leading her through a few
1654,LIVE DOLLS.,"streets, her aunt stopped at a house, and asked to be shown into the"
1655,LIVE DOLLS.,workroom. It was a room where a number of young girls were sitting at a
1656,LIVE DOLLS.,"long table, with cheerful and busy looks. The table was covered with"
1657,LIVE DOLLS.,"workbags, needlecases, thread-papers, and such like sewing implements,"
1658,LIVE DOLLS.,"and spread with flannel, calico, dimity, and old linen; one of the girls"
1659,LIVE DOLLS.,"was making a cap, another a petticoat, a third a frock—the elder ones"
1660,LIVE DOLLS.,were cutting out the cloth—some of the little ones were stretching out
1661,LIVE DOLLS.,their hands to hold a skein of thread for the others to wind; not one
1662,LIVE DOLLS.,was unemployed. “What are they all doing?” said Eliza.
1663,LIVE DOLLS.,
1664,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ They are all working for live dolls.
1665,LIVE DOLLS.,
1666,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ But where are the dolls?
1667,LIVE DOLLS.,
1668,LIVE DOLLS.,_Mrs. D._ You cannot see them yet; they would suffer if the clothes were
1669,LIVE DOLLS.,not prepared for them before they came.
1670,LIVE DOLLS.,
1671,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ But here are no laces nor worked muslins; here is nothing very
1672,LIVE DOLLS.,pretty.
1673,LIVE DOLLS.,
1674,LIVE DOLLS.,"_Mrs. D._ No, because pretty things seldom have the property of keeping"
1675,LIVE DOLLS.,the wearers warm.
1676,LIVE DOLLS.,
1677,LIVE DOLLS.,_Eliza._ But who are they working for?
1678,LIVE DOLLS.,
1679,LIVE DOLLS.,"At that instant, a woman, with a child upon her bosom, pale, but with a"
1680,LIVE DOLLS.,"countenance shining with joy and gratitude, entered the workroom,"
1681,LIVE DOLLS.,"pouring out her thanks to the good young ladies, as she truly called"
1682,LIVE DOLLS.,"them, for their well-timed bounty. “But for you,” she said, “this dear"
1683,LIVE DOLLS.,"little infant might perhaps have perished, or at least its little limbs"
1684,LIVE DOLLS.,would have been chilled with cold for want of good and substantial
1685,LIVE DOLLS.,"clothing. My husband was ill, and could not work, and I had no money to"
1686,LIVE DOLLS.,"buy anything but necessary food. If I could have bought the materials,"
1687,LIVE DOLLS.,"or if you had given them me, I could not have cut them out and contrived"
1688,LIVE DOLLS.,"them, and made them up myself: for I was never taught to be handy at my"
1689,LIVE DOLLS.,"needle as you have been, ladies. I was only set to coarse work. Look"
1690,LIVE DOLLS.,"what a sweet little infant it is, and how comfortable he looks. God"
1691,LIVE DOLLS.,"bless you, dear ladies! and make you all happy wives and mothers, when"
1692,LIVE DOLLS.,"the time comes!” The girls, with great pleasure, rose when she had"
1693,LIVE DOLLS.,"finished her address to them; and after congratulating the mother, took"
1694,LIVE DOLLS.,"the infant, and handing it from one to another, kissed and played with"
1695,LIVE DOLLS.,"it. Eliza, too, advanced, but timidly, and as if she had not yet earned"
1696,LIVE DOLLS.,"a right to caress it. “Approach, my niece,” said Mrs. Dorcas, “kiss the"
1697,LIVE DOLLS.,"lips of this infant, and imbibe that affection which is one of the"
1698,LIVE DOLLS.,"characteristics of your sex. Women are made to love children, and they"
1699,LIVE DOLLS.,should begin to love them while they themselves are children; nor is
1700,LIVE DOLLS.,"there any surer way of learning to love a being, than by doing good to"
1701,LIVE DOLLS.,it. You see now why I brought you hither. This is the live doll I
1702,LIVE DOLLS.,"promised you; its limbs are not the work of a clumsy mechanic, they are"
1703,LIVE DOLLS.,"fashioned by consummate wisdom and skill, and it will not always remain"
1704,LIVE DOLLS.,as it is: this little frame has a principle of improvement in it—it has
1705,LIVE DOLLS.,powers that will unfold themselves by degrees—the limbs will stretch and
1706,LIVE DOLLS.,"grow; after a while it will walk, it will speak, it will play, it will"
1707,LIVE DOLLS.,be like one of you. How precious then is the life of such a creature!
1708,LIVE DOLLS.,But it has pleased the Creator of all things that this excellent being
1709,LIVE DOLLS.,"should come into the world naked and helpless; it has neither hair, nor"
1710,LIVE DOLLS.,"wool, nor fur, nor feathers to keep it warm; if not clothed and"
1711,LIVE DOLLS.,"cherished, it would soon be killed with the cold. It is, therefore, very"
1712,LIVE DOLLS.,desirable to help those poor people who cannot afford to clothe their
1713,LIVE DOLLS.,"infants, lest so admirable a work of God as a human creature should"
1714,LIVE DOLLS.,perish for want of care. There is a great deal of pain and danger in
1715,LIVE DOLLS.,bearing children in any situation of life; but when people are poor as
1716,LIVE DOLLS.,"well as sick, the distress is very much increased. These good young"
1717,LIVE DOLLS.,"ladies, Eliza, have formed a society among themselves for making"
1718,LIVE DOLLS.,baby-linen for the poor. Nobody bid them do it; it was entirely of their
1719,LIVE DOLLS.,own accord. They have agreed to subscribe a penny a week out of their
1720,LIVE DOLLS.,little pocket-money. A penny is a very small matter; girls who have a
1721,LIVE DOLLS.,"great deal of money perhaps would not suppose it worth thinking about,"
1722,LIVE DOLLS.,but a great many pennies every week will in time come to a sum that is
1723,LIVE DOLLS.,"not so contemptible. With this they buy the materials, such as warm"
1724,LIVE DOLLS.,"flannels, coarse printed cottons, and dimity. Their mammas give them,"
1725,LIVE DOLLS.,"every now and then, some fine old linen and cast-off clothes; but the"
1726,LIVE DOLLS.,value of their work is a great deal more than that of the materials: if
1727,LIVE DOLLS.,"they did not cut and contrive, and make them up, they would be of little"
1728,LIVE DOLLS.,"service comparatively to the poor people; besides, the doing so will"
1729,LIVE DOLLS.,make them clever managers when they come to have children of their own.
1730,LIVE DOLLS.,None of these good girls are above fourteen; and they have clothed a
1731,LIVE DOLLS.,"number of little helpless infants, and made, as you have seen, the"
1732,LIVE DOLLS.,"mothers’ hearts very glad. Now, if you wish it, I dare say they will let"
1733,LIVE DOLLS.,"you work with them; but here is no finery, and if you like better to"
1734,LIVE DOLLS.,"work for your wax-doll, do so.”—“O, no!” said Eliza, “the live doll for"
1735,LIVE DOLLS.,me;” and she bespoke a place at the long worktable.

1742,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1743,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"A debate once arose among the animals in a farmyard, which of them was"
1744,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"most valued by their common master. After the horse, the ox, the cow,"
1745,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"the sheep, and the dog, had stated their several pretensions, the hog"
1746,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,took up the discourse.
1747,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1748,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“It is plain,” said he, “that the greatest value must be set upon that"
1749,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"animal which is kept most for his own sake, without expecting from him"
1750,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"any return of use and service. Now, which of you can boast so much in"
1751,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,that respect as I can?
1752,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1753,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“As for you, horse, though you are very well fed and lodged, and have"
1754,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"servants to attend upon you, and make you sleek and clean, yet all this"
1755,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,is for the sake of your labour. Do not I see you taken out early every
1756,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"morning, put in chains, or fastened to the shafts of a heavy cart, and"
1757,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"not brought back till noon; when, after a short respite, you are taken"
1758,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,to work again till late in the evening? I may say just the same to the
1759,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"ox, except that he works for poorer fare."
1760,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1761,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“For you, Mrs. Cow, who are so dainty over your chopped straw and"
1762,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"grains, you are thought worth keeping only for your milk, which is"
1763,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"drained from you twice a day to the last drop, while your poor young"
1764,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"ones are taken from you, and sent I know not whither."
1765,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1766,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“You, poor innocent sheep, who are turned out to shift for yourselves"
1767,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"upon the bare hills, or penned upon the fallows with now and then a"
1768,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"withered turnip or some musty hay, you pay dearly enough for your keep"
1769,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"by resigning your warm coat every year, for want of which you are liable"
1770,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,to be frozen to death on some of the cold nights before summer.
1771,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1772,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“As for the dog, who prides himself so much on being admitted to our"
1773,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"master’s table, and made his companion, that he will scarce condescend"
1774,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"to reckon himself one of us, he is obliged to do all the offices of a"
1775,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"domestic servant by day, and to keep watch during the night, while we"
1776,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,are quietly asleep.
1777,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1778,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"“In short, you are all of you creatures maintained for use—poor"
1779,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"subservient things, made to be enslaved or pillaged. I, on the contrary,"
1780,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,have a warm stye and plenty of provisions all at free cost. I have
1781,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,nothing to do but grow fat and follow my amusement; and my master is
1782,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"best pleased when he sees me lying at ease in the sun, or filling my"
1783,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,belly.”
1784,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1785,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"Thus argued the hog, and put the rest to silence by so much logic and"
1786,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,rhetoric. This was not long before winter set in. It proved a very
1787,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,scarce season for fodder of all kinds; so that the farmer began to
1788,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,consider how he was to maintain all his live stock till spring. “It will
1789,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"be impossible for me,” thought he, “to keep them all; I must therefore"
1790,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"part with those I can best spare. As for my horses and working oxen, I"
1791,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"shall have business enough to employ them; they must be kept, cost what"
1792,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"it will. My cows will not give me much milk in the winter, but they will"
1793,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"calve in the spring, and be ready for the new grass. I must not lose the"
1794,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"profit of my dairy. The sheep, poor things, will take care of themselves"
1795,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"as long as there is a bite upon the hills; and if deep snow comes, we"
1796,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,must do with them as well as we can by the help of a few turnips and
1797,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"some hay, for I must have their wool at shearing-time to make out my"
1798,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"rent with. But my hogs will eat me out of house and home, without doing"
1799,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"me any good. They must go to pot, that’s certain; and the sooner I get"
1800,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"rid of the fat ones, the better.”"
1801,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,
1802,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,"So saying, he singled out the orator as one of the prime among them, and"
1803,THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.,sent him to the butcher the very next day.

1815,THE BULLIES.,
1816,THE BULLIES.,"As young Francis was walking through a village with his tutor, they were"
1817,THE BULLIES.,"annoyed by two or three cur-dogs, that came running after them with"
1818,THE BULLIES.,"looks of the utmost fury, snarling and barking as if they would tear"
1819,THE BULLIES.,"their throats, and seeming every moment ready to fly upon them. Francis"
1820,THE BULLIES.,"every now and then stopped and shook his stick at them, or stooped down"
1821,THE BULLIES.,"to pick up a stone, upon which the curs retreated as fast as they came;"
1822,THE BULLIES.,"but as soon as he turned about, they were after his heels again. This"
1823,THE BULLIES.,"lasted till they came to a farmyard, through which their road lay. A"
1824,THE BULLIES.,large mastiff was lying down in it at his ease in the sun. Francis was
1825,THE BULLIES.,"almost afraid to pass him, and kept as close to his tutor as possible."
1826,THE BULLIES.,"However, the dog took not the least notice of them."
1827,THE BULLIES.,
1828,THE BULLIES.,"Presently, they came upon a common, where, going near a flock of geese,"
1829,THE BULLIES.,"they were assailed with hissings, and pursued some way by these foolish"
1830,THE BULLIES.,"birds, which, stretching out their long necks, made a very ridiculous"
1831,THE BULLIES.,"figure. Francis only laughed at them, though he was tempted to give the"
1832,THE BULLIES.,foremost a switch across his neck. A little further was a herd of cows
1833,THE BULLIES.,"with a bull among them, upon which Francis looked with some degree of"
1834,THE BULLIES.,"apprehension; but they kept quietly grazing, and did not take their"
1835,THE BULLIES.,heads from the ground as he passed.
1836,THE BULLIES.,
1837,THE BULLIES.,"“It is a lucky thing,” said Francis to his tutor, “that mastiffs and"
1838,THE BULLIES.,bulls are not so quarrelsome as curs and geese; but what can be the
1839,THE BULLIES.,reason of it?”
1840,THE BULLIES.,
1841,THE BULLIES.,"“The reason,” replied the tutor, “is, that paltry and contemptible"
1842,THE BULLIES.,"animals, possessing no confidence in their own strength and courage, and"
1843,THE BULLIES.,knowing themselves liable to injury from most of those that come in
1844,THE BULLIES.,"their way, think it safer to take the part of bullies, and to make a"
1845,THE BULLIES.,"show of attacking those of whom in reality they are afraid: whereas,"
1846,THE BULLIES.,animals which are conscious of force sufficient for their own
1847,THE BULLIES.,"protection, suspecting no evil designs from others, entertain none"
1848,THE BULLIES.,"themselves, but maintain dignified composure."
1849,THE BULLIES.,
1850,THE BULLIES.,"“Thus you will find it among mankind. Weak, mean, petty characters are"
1851,THE BULLIES.,"suspicious, snarling, and petulant. They raise an outcry against their"
1852,THE BULLIES.,"superiors in talents and reputation, of whom they stand in awe, and put"
1853,THE BULLIES.,on airs of defiance and insolence through mere cowardice. But the truly
1854,THE BULLIES.,"great are calm and inoffensive. They fear no injury, and offer none."
1855,THE BULLIES.,"They even suffer slight attacks to go unnoticed, conscious of their"
1856,THE BULLIES.,power to right themselves whenever the occasion shall seem to require
1857,THE BULLIES.,it.”

1864,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1865,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"There was a garden enclosed with high brick walls, and laid out somewhat"
1866,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"in the old fashion. Under the walls were wide beds planted with flowers,"
1867,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"garden-stuff, and fruit-trees. Next to them was a broad gravel-walk"
1868,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"running round the garden; and the middle was laid out in grass-plots,"
1869,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,and beds of flowers and shrubs with a fish-pond in the centre.
1870,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1871,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"Near the root of one of the wall fruit-trees, a numerous colony of ants"
1872,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"was established, which had extended its subterraneous works over great"
1873,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"part of the bed in its neighbourhood. One day, two of the inhabitants,"
1874,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"meeting in a gallery under ground, fell into the following"
1875,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,conversation:—
1876,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1877,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Ha! my friend,” said the first, “is it you? I am glad to see you. Where"
1878,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,have you been this long time? All your acquaintance have been in pain
1879,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"about you, lest some accident should have befallen you.”"
1880,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1881,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Why,” replied the other, “I am, indeed, a sort of stranger, for you"
1882,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,must know I am but just returned from a long journey.”
1883,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1884,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“A journey! whither, pray, and on what account?”"
1885,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1886,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“A tour of mere curiosity. I had long felt dissatisfied with knowing so
1887,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"little about this world of ours; so, at length, I took a resolution to"
1888,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,explore it. And I may now boast that I have gone round its utmost
1889,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"extremities, and that no considerable part of it has escaped my"
1890,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,researches.”
1891,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1892,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Wonderful! What a traveller you have been, and what sights you must"
1893,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,have seen!”
1894,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1895,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Why, yes—I have seen more than most ants, to be sure; but it has been"
1896,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"at the expense of so much toil and danger, that I know not whether it"
1897,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,was worth the pains.”
1898,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1899,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“Would you oblige me with some account of your adventures?”
1900,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1901,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Willingly: I set out, then, early one sunshiny morning; and, after"
1902,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,crossing our territory and the line of plantation by which it is
1903,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"bordered; I came upon a wide open plain, where, as far as the eye could"
1904,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"reach, not a single green thing was to be descried, but the hard soil"
1905,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"was everywhere covered with huge stones, which made travelling equally"
1906,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"painful to the eye and the feet. As I was toiling onward, I heard a"
1907,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"rumbling noise behind me, which became louder and louder. I looked back,"
1908,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,and with the utmost horror beheld a prodigious rolling mountain
1909,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,approaching me so fast that it was impossible to get out of the way. I
1910,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"threw myself flat on the ground behind a stone, and lay expecting"
1911,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"nothing but present death. The mountain soon passed over me, and I"
1912,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,continued (I know not how long) in a state of insensibility. When I
1913,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"recovered, I began to stretch my limbs one by one, and, to my surprise,"
1914,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,found myself not in the least injured! but the stone beside me was
1915,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,almost buried in the earth by the crash!”
1916,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1917,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“What an escape!”
1918,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1919,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“A wonderful one, indeed. I journeyed on over the desert, and at length"
1920,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"came to the end of it, and entered upon a wide green tract consisting"
1921,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"chiefly of tall, narrow, pointed leaves, which grew so thick and"
1922,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"entangled, that it was with the greatest difficulty I could make my way"
1923,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"between them; and I should continually have lost my road, had I not"
1924,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,taken care to keep the sun in view before me. When I had got near the
1925,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"middle of this region, I was startled with the sight of a huge"
1926,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"four-legged monster, with a yellow speckled skin, which took a flying"
1927,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"leap directly over me. Somewhat farther, before I was aware, I ran upon"
1928,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"one of those long, round, crawling creatures, without head, tail, or"
1929,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"legs, which we sometimes meet with under ground, near our settlement. As"
1930,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"soon as he felt me upon him, he drew back into his hole so swiftly, that"
1931,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"he was near drawing me in along with him. However, I jumped off, and"
1932,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,proceeded on my way.
1933,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1934,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“With much labour I got, at last, to the end of this perplexed tract,"
1935,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"and came to an open space like that in which we live, in the midst of"
1936,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,which grew trees so tall that I could not see to their tops. Being
1937,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"hungry, I climbed the first I came to, in expectation of finding some"
1938,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,fruit; but after a weary search I returned empty. I tried several others
1939,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"with no better success. There were, indeed, leaves and flowers in"
1940,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"plenty, but nothing of which I could make a meal; so that I might have"
1941,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"been famished, had I not found some sour harsh berries upon the ground,"
1942,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"on which I made a poor repast. While I was doing this, a greater danger"
1943,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,than any of the former befell me. One of those two-legged feathered
1944,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"creatures, which we often see to our cost, jumped down from a bough, and"
1945,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,picked up in his enormous beak the very berry on which I was standing.
1946,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"Luckily, he did not swallow it immediately, but flew up again with it to"
1947,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"the tree; and, in the meantime, I disengaged myself, and fell from a"
1948,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"vast height to the ground, but received no hurt."
1949,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1950,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“I crossed this plantation, and came to another entangled green like the"
1951,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"first. After I had laboured through it, I came on a sudden to the side"
1952,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"of a vast glittering plain, the nature of which I could not possibly"
1953,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"guess at. I walked along a fallen leaf which lay on the side, and coming"
1954,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"to the farther edge of it, I was greatly surprised to see another ant"
1955,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,coming from below to meet me. I advanced to give him a fraternal
1956,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"embrace; but instead of what I expected, I met a cold yielding matter,"
1957,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"in which I should have sunk, had I not speedily turned about, and caught"
1958,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"hold of the leaf, by which I drew myself up again. And now I found this"
1959,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"great plain to consist of that fluid which sometimes falls from the sky,"
1960,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,and causes so much trouble by filling our holes.
1961,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1962,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“As I stood considering how to proceed on my journey, a gentle breeze"
1963,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"arose, which, before I was aware, carried the leaf I was upon away from"
1964,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"the solid land into this yielding fluid, which, however, bore it up and"
1965,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"me along with it. At first, I was greatly alarmed, and ran round and"
1966,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,round my leaf in order to find some way of getting back; but perceiving
1967,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"this to be impracticable, I resigned myself to my fate, and even began"
1968,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,to take some pleasure in the easy motion by which I was borne forward.
1969,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,But what new and wonderful forms of living creatures did I see
1970,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"inhabiting this liquid land! Bodies of prodigious bulk, covered with"
1971,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"shining scales of various colours, shot by me with vast rapidity, and"
1972,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"sported a thousand ways. They had large heads and staring eyes,"
1973,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"tremendous wide mouths, but no legs; and they seemed to be carried on by"
1974,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,the action of something like small wings planted on various parts of the
1975,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"body, and especially at the end of the tail, which continually waved"
1976,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"about. Other smaller creatures, of a great variety of extraordinary"
1977,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"forms, were moving through the clear fluid, or resting upon its surface;"
1978,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,and I saw with terror numbers of them continually seized and swallowed
1979,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,by the larger ones before-mentioned.
1980,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1981,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“When I had got near the middle, the smooth surface of this plain was"
1982,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"all roughened, and moved up and down, so as to toss about my leaf, and"
1983,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"nearly overset it. I trembled to think what would become of me, should I"
1984,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"be thrown amidst all these terrible monsters. At last, however, I got"
1985,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"safe to the other side, and with joy set my feet on dry land again. I"
1986,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"ascended a gentle green slope, which led to a tall plantation like that"
1987,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"I had before passed through. Another green plain, and another stony"
1988,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"desert, succeeded; which brought me, at length, to the opposite boundary"
1989,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"of our world, enclosed by the same immense mound rising to the heavens,"
1990,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,which limits us on this side.
1991,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
1992,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“Here I fell in with another nation of our species differing little in
1993,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"way of life from ourselves. They invited me to their settlement, and"
1994,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"entertained me hospitably, and I accompanied them in several excursions"
1995,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,in the neighbourhood. There was a charming fruit-tree at no great
1996,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"distance, to which we made frequent visits. One day as I was regaling"
1997,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"deliciously on the heart of a green-gage plum, I felt myself on a sudden"
1998,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"carried along with great swiftness, till I got into a dark place, where"
1999,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"a horrid crash threw me upon a soft moist piece of flesh, whence I was"
2000,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"soon driven forth in a torrent of wind and moisture, and found myself on"
2001,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,the ground all covered with slime. I disengaged myself with difficulty
2002,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"and looking up, descried one of those enormous two-legged animals, which"
2003,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"often shake the ground over our heads, and put us in terror."
2004,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2005,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“My new friends now began to hint to me that it was time to depart, ‘for"
2006,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"you know we are not fond of naturalizing strangers.’ And lucky, indeed,"
2007,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,it was for me that I received the hint when I did; for I had but just
2008,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"left the place, and was travelling over a neighbouring eminence, when I"
2009,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,heard behind me a tremendous noise; and looking back I saw the whole of
2010,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,their settlement blown into the air with a prodigious explosion of fire
2011,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"and smoke. Numbers of half-burnt bodies, together with the ruins of"
2012,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"their habitations, were thrown to a vast distance around; and such a"
2013,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"suffocating vapour arose, that I lay for some time deprived of sense and"
2014,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,motion. From some of the wretched fugitives I learned that the disaster
2015,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,was attributed to subterranean fire bursting its way to the surface: the
2016,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"cause of which, however, was supposed to be connected with the"
2017,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"machinations of that malignant two-legged monster, from whose jaws I had"
2018,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"so narrowly escaped, who had been observed, just before the explosion,"
2019,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,to pour through the holes leading to the great apartment of the
2020,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"settlement, a number of black shining grains."
2021,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2022,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“On my return from this remote country, I kept along the boundary-wall,"
2023,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,which I knew by observation must at length bring me back to my own home.
2024,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"I met with several wandering tribes of our species in my road, and"
2025,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"frequently joined their foraging parties in search of food. One day, a"
2026,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"company of us, allured by the smell of something sweet, climbed some"
2027,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"lofty pillars, on which was placed a vast round edifice, having only one"
2028,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"entrance. At this, were continually going in and coming out those winged"
2029,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"animals, somewhat like ourselves in form, but many times bigger, and"
2030,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"armed with a dreadful sting, which we so often meet with sipping the"
2031,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,juices of flowers; but whether they were the architects of this great
2032,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"mansion, or it was built for them by some beneficent being of great"
2033,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"powers, I am unable to decide. It seemed, however, to be the place where"
2034,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,they deposited what they so industriously collect; for they were
2035,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"perpetually arriving loaded with a fragrant substance, which they"
2036,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"carried in, and then returned empty. We had a great desire to enter with"
2037,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"them, but were deterred by their formidable appearance, and a kind of"
2038,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"angry hum, which continually proceeded from the house. At length two or"
2039,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"three of the boldest of our party, watching a time when the entrance was"
2040,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"pretty free, ventured to go in: but we soon saw them driven out in great"
2041,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"haste, and trampled down and massacred at the gateway. The rest of us"
2042,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,made a speedy retreat.
2043,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2044,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“Two more adventures which happened to me had very nearly prevented my
2045,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"return to my own country. Having one evening, together with a companion,"
2046,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"taken up my quarters in an empty snail-shell, there came on such a"
2047,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"shower of rain in the night, that the shell was presently filled. I"
2048,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"awaked just suffocated; but, luckily, having my head turned towards the"
2049,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"mouth of the shell, I rose to the top, and made a shift to crawl to a"
2050,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"dry place. My companion, who had got farther into the shell, never rose"
2051,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,again.
2052,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2053,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Not long after, as I was travelling under the wall, I descried a"
2054,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"curious pit, with a circular orifice, gradually growing narrower to the"
2055,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"bottom. On coming close to the brink in order to survey it, the edge,"
2056,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"which was of fine sand, gave way and I slid down the pit. As soon as I"
2057,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"had reached the bottom, a creature with a huge pair of horns and"
2058,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"dreadful claws made his appearance from beneath the sand, and attempted"
2059,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"to seize me. I flew back, and ran up the side of the pit; when he threw"
2060,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"over me such a shower of sand as blinded me, and had like to have"
2061,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"brought me down again. However, by exerting all my strength, I got out"
2062,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"of his reach, and did not cease running till I was at a considerable"
2063,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"distance. I was afterward informed that this was the den of an antlion,"
2064,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"a terrible foe of our species, which, not equalling us in speed, is"
2065,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,obliged to make use of this crafty device to entrap his heedless prey.
2066,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2067,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“This was the last of my perils. To my great joy, I reached my native"
2068,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"place last night, where I mean to stay content for the future. I do not"
2069,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"know how far I have benefited from my travels, but one important"
2070,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,conclusion I have drawn from them.”
2071,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2072,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“What is that?” said his friend.
2073,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2074,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Why, you know it is the current opinion with us, that everything in"
2075,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"this world was made for our use. Now, I have seen such vast tracts not"
2076,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"at all fit for our residence, and peopled with creatures so much larger"
2077,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"and stronger than ourselves, that I cannot help being convinced that the"
2078,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"Creator had in view their accommodation as well as ours, in making this"
2079,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,world.”
2080,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2081,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“I confess this seems probable enough; but you had better keep your
2082,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,opinion to yourself.”
2083,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2084,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“Why so?”
2085,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2086,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“You know we ants are a vain race, and make high pretensions to wisdom"
2087,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,as well as antiquity. We shall be affronted with any attempts to lessen
2088,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,our importance in our own eyes.”
2089,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2090,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,“But there is no wisdom in being deceived.”
2091,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,
2092,THE TRAVELLED ANT.,"“Well—do as you think proper. Meantime, farewell, and thanks for the"

2112,_A._?”,"a gentleman-farmer. Labourers will be scarce among us, and every man"
2113,_A._?”,"must put his own hand to the plough. There will be woods to clear, and"
2114,_A._?”,"marshes to drain, and a great deal of stubborn work to do."
2115,_A._?”,
2116,_A._?”,"_A._ I shall be ready to do my part, sir."
2117,_A._?”,
2118,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Well, then, I shall entertain you willingly, and as many more"
2119,_A._?”,"of your profession as you can bring. You shall have land enough, and"
2120,_A._?”,utensils; and you may fall to work as soon as you please. Now for the
2121,_A._?”,next.
2122,_A._?”,
2123,_A._?”,"_B._ I am a miller, sir."
2124,_A._?”,
2125,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ A very useful trade! The corn we grow must be ground, or it"
2126,_A._?”,"will do us little good. But what will you do for a mill, my friend?"
2127,_A._?”,
2128,_A._?”,"_B._ I suppose we must make one, sir."
2129,_A._?”,
2130,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ True; but then you must bring with you a millwright for the
2131,_A._?”,"purpose. As for millstones, we will take them out with us. Who is next?"
2132,_A._?”,
2133,_A._?”,"_C._ I am a carpenter, sir."
2134,_A._?”,
2135,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ The most necessary man that could offer! We shall find you work
2136,_A._?”,"enough, never fear. There will be houses to build, fences to make, and"
2137,_A._?”,all kinds of wooden furniture to provide. But our timber is all growing.
2138,_A._?”,"You will have a great deal of hard work to do in felling trees, and"
2139,_A._?”,"sawing planks, and shaping posts and the like. You must be a"
2140,_A._?”,field-carpenter as well as a house-carpenter.
2141,_A._?”,
2142,_A._?”,"_C._ I will, sir."
2143,_A._?”,
2144,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Very well! then I engage you, but you had better bring two or"
2145,_A._?”,three able hands along with you.
2146,_A._?”,
2147,_A._?”,"_D._ I am a blacksmith, sir."
2148,_A._?”,
2149,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ An excellent companion for the carpenter! We cannot do without
2150,_A._?”,"either of you; so you may bring your great bellows and anvil, and we"
2151,_A._?”,"will set up a forge for you as soon as we arrive. But, by-the-by, we"
2152,_A._?”,shall want a mason for that purpose.
2153,_A._?”,
2154,_A._?”,"_E._ I am one, sir."
2155,_A._?”,
2156,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ That’s well. Though we may live in loghouses at first, we shall"
2157,_A._?”,"want brick or stone work for chimneys, and hearths, and ovens; so there"
2158,_A._?”,will be employment for a mason. But if you can make bricks and burn
2159,_A._?”,"lime, too, you will be still more useful."
2160,_A._?”,
2161,_A._?”,"_E._ I will try what I can do, sir."
2162,_A._?”,
2163,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ No man can do more. I engage you. Who is next?
2164,_A._?”,
2165,_A._?”,"_F._ I am a shoemaker, sir."
2166,_A._?”,
2167,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ And shoes we cannot well do without. But can you make them,"
2168,_A._?”,"like Eumæus in the Odyssey, out of a raw hide? for I fear we shall get"
2169,_A._?”,no leather.
2170,_A._?”,
2171,_A._?”,"_F._ But I can dress hides, too."
2172,_A._?”,
2173,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Can you?—then you are a clever fellow, and I will have you,"
2174,_A._?”,though I give you double wages.
2175,_A._?”,
2176,_A._?”,"_G._ I am a tailor, sir."
2177,_A._?”,
2178,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Well—though it will be some time before we want holyday-suits,"
2179,_A._?”,yet we must not go naked; so there will be work for the tailor But you
2180,_A._?”,"are not above mending and botching, I hope, for we must not mind patched"
2181,_A._?”,clothes while we work in the woods.
2182,_A._?”,
2183,_A._?”,"_G._ I am not, sir."
2184,_A._?”,
2185,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Then I engage you, too."
2186,_A._?”,
2187,_A._?”,"_H._ I am a weaver, sir."
2188,_A._?”,
2189,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Weaving is a very useful art, but I question if we can find"
2190,_A._?”,room for it in our colony for the present. We shall not grow either hemp
2191,_A._?”,"or flax for some time to come, and it will be cheaper for us to import"
2192,_A._?”,"our cloth than to make it. In a few years, however, we may be very glad"
2193,_A._?”,of you.
2194,_A._?”,
2195,_A._?”,"_J._ I am a silversmith and jeweller, sir."
2196,_A._?”,
2197,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Then, my friend, you cannot go to a worse place than a new"
2198,_A._?”,"colony to set up your trade in. You will break us, or we shall starve"
2199,_A._?”,you.
2200,_A._?”,
2201,_A._?”,"_J._ But I understand clock and watch making, too."
2202,_A._?”,
2203,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ That is somewhat more to our purpose, for we shall want to know"
2204,_A._?”,how time goes. But I doubt we cannot give you sufficient encouragement
2205,_A._?”,for a long time to come. For the present you had better stay where you
2206,_A._?”,are.
2207,_A._?”,
2208,_A._?”,"_K._ I am a barber and hairdresser, sir."
2209,_A._?”,
2210,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ Alas! what can we do with you? If you will shave our men’s
2211,_A._?”,"rough beards once a week, and crop their hair once a quarter, and be"
2212,_A._?”,"content to help the carpenter, or follow the plough the rest of your"
2213,_A._?”,"time, we shall reward you accordingly. But you will have no ladies and"
2214,_A._?”,"gentlemen to dress for a ball, or wigs to curl and powder for Sundays, I"
2215,_A._?”,assure you. Your trade will not stand by itself with us for a great time
2216,_A._?”,to come.
2217,_A._?”,
2218,_A._?”,"_L._ I am a medical man, sir."
2219,_A._?”,
2220,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Then, sir, you are very welcome. Health is the first of"
2221,_A._?”,"blessings, and if you can give us that, you will be a valuable man"
2222,_A._?”,"indeed. But I hope you understand surgery as well as physic, for we are"
2223,_A._?”,"likely enough to get cuts and bruises, and broken bones occasionally."
2224,_A._?”,
2225,_A._?”,"_L._ I have had experience in that branch too, sir."
2226,_A._?”,
2227,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ And if you understand the nature of plants, and their uses both"
2228,_A._?”,"in medicine and diet, it will be a great addition to your usefulness."
2229,_A._?”,
2230,_A._?”,"_L._ Botany has been a favourite study with me, sir; and I have some"
2231,_A._?”,"knowledge of chymistry, and the other parts of natural history, too."
2232,_A._?”,
2233,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Then you will be a treasure to us, sir, and I shall be happy to"
2234,_A._?”,make it worth your while to go with us.
2235,_A._?”,
2236,_A._?”,"_M._ I, sir, am a lawyer."
2237,_A._?”,
2238,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Sir, your most obedient servant. When we are rich enough to go"
2239,_A._?”,"to law, we will let you know."
2240,_A._?”,
2241,_A._?”,"_N._ I am a schoolmaster, sir."
2242,_A._?”,
2243,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ That is a profession which I am sure I do not mean to
2244,_A._?”,"undervalue; and as soon as ever we have young folks in our colony, we"
2245,_A._?”,"shall be glad of your services. Though we are to be hard-working, plain"
2246,_A._?”,"people, we do not intend to be ignorant, and we shall make it a point to"
2247,_A._?”,"have every one taught reading and writing, at least. In the meantime,"
2248,_A._?”,"till we have employment enough for you in teaching, you may keep the"
2249,_A._?”,accounts and records of the colony: and on Sunday you may read prayers
2250,_A._?”,to all those that choose to attend upon you.
2251,_A._?”,
2252,_A._?”,"_N._ With all my heart, sir."
2253,_A._?”,
2254,_A._?”,_Mr. B._ Then I engage you. Who comes here with so bold an air?
2255,_A._?”,
2256,_A._?”,"_O._ I am a soldier, sir; will you have me?"
2257,_A._?”,
2258,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ We are peaceable people, and I hope shall have no occasion to"
2259,_A._?”,"fight. We mean honestly to purchase our land from the natives, and to be"
2260,_A._?”,"just and fair in all our dealings with them. William Penn, the founder"
2261,_A._?”,of Pennsylvania followed that plan; and when the Indians were at war
2262,_A._?”,"with all the other European settlers, a person in a quaker’s habit might"
2263,_A._?”,pass through all their most ferocious tribes without the least injury.
2264,_A._?”,"It is my intention, however, to make all my colonists soldiers, so far"
2265,_A._?”,"as to be able to defend themselves if attacked, and that being the case,"
2266,_A._?”,we shall have no need of _soldiers by trade_.
2267,_A._?”,
2268,_A._?”,"_P._ I am a gentleman, sir; and I have a great desire to accompany you,"
2269,_A._?”,because I hear game is very plentiful in that country.
2270,_A._?”,
2271,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ A gentleman! And what good will you do us, sir?"
2272,_A._?”,
2273,_A._?”,"_P._ O, sir, that is not at all my intention. I only mean to amuse"
2274,_A._?”,myself.
2275,_A._?”,
2276,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ But do you mean, sir, that we should pay for your amusement?"
2277,_A._?”,
2278,_A._?”,"_P._ As to maintenance, I expect to be able to kill game enough for my"
2279,_A._?”,"own eating, with a little bread and garden-stuff, which you will give"
2280,_A._?”,me. Then I will be content with a house somewhat better than the common
2281,_A._?”,ones; and your barber shall be my valet; so I shall give very little
2282,_A._?”,trouble.
2283,_A._?”,
2284,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ And pray, sir, what inducement can we have for doing all this"
2285,_A._?”,for you?
2286,_A._?”,
2287,_A._?”,"_P._ Why, sir, you will have the credit of having _one gentleman_ at"
2288,_A._?”,least in your colony.
2289,_A._?”,
2290,_A._?”,"_Mr. B._ Ha, ha, ha! A facetious gentleman, truly! Well, sir, when we"
2291,_A._?”,"are ambitious of such a distinction, we will send for you."

2304,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"Keeper was a farmer’s mastiff, honest, brave, and vigilant. One day, as"
2305,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"he was ranging at some distance from home, he espied a wolf and a fox"
2306,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"sitting together at the corner of a wood. Keeper, not much liking their"
2307,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"looks, though by no means fearing them, was turning another way, when"
2308,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"they called after him, and civilly desired him to stay, “Surely, sir,”"
2309,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"says Reynard, “you wo’n’t disown your relations. My cousin Gaunt and I"
2310,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"were just talking over family-matters, and we both agreed that we had"
2311,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"the honour of reckoning you among our kin. You must know that, according"
2312,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"to the best accounts, the wolves and dogs were originally one race in"
2313,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"the forests of Armenia; but the dogs, taking to living with man, have"
2314,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"since become inhabitants of towns and villages, while the wolves have"
2315,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"retained their ancient mode of life. As to my ancestors, the foxes, they"
2316,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"were a branch of the same family, who settled farther northward, where"
2317,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"they became stinted in their growth, and adopted the custom of living in"
2318,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"holes under ground. The cold has sharpened our noses, and given us a"
2319,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,thicker fur and bushy tails to keep us warm. But we have all a family
2320,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,likeness which it is impossible to mistake; and I am sure it is our
2321,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,interest to be good friends with each other.”
2322,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,
2323,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"The wolf was of the same opinion; and Keeper, looking narrowly at them,"
2324,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,could not help acknowledging their relationship. As he had a generous
2325,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"heart, he readily entered into friendship with them. They took a ramble"
2326,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,together; but Keeper was rather surprised at observing the suspicious
2327,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"shyness with which some of the weaker sort of animals surveyed them, and"
2328,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,wondered at the hasty flight of a flock of sheep as soon as they came
2329,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"within view. However, he gave his cousins a cordial invitation to come"
2330,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"and see him at his yard, and then took his leave."
2331,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,
2332,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,They did not fail to come the next day about dusk. Keeper received them
2333,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"kindly, and treated them with part of his own supper. They stayed with"
2334,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"him till after dark, and then marched off with many compliments. The"
2335,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,next morning word was brought to the farm that a goose and three
2336,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"goslings were missing, and that a couple of lambs were found almost"
2337,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,devoured in the home-field. Keeper was too honest himself readily to
2338,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"suspect others, so he never thought of his kinsmen on the occasion. Soon"
2339,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"after, they paid him a second evening visit; and next day, another loss"
2340,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"appeared, of a hen and her chickens, and a fat sheep. Now Keeper could"
2341,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"not help mistrusting a little, and blamed himself for admitting"
2342,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"strangers without his master’s knowledge. However, he still did not love"
2343,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,to think ill of his own relations.
2344,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,
2345,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,They came a third time. Keeper received them rather coldly; and hinted
2346,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,that he should like better to see them in the daytime; but they excused
2347,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,themselves for want of leisure. When they took their leave he resolved
2348,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,to follow at some distance and watch their motions. A litter of young
2349,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,pigs happened to be lying under a haystack without the yard. The wolf
2350,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"seized one by the back, and ran off with him. The pig set up a most"
2351,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"dismal squeal; and Keeper, running up at the noise, caught his dear"
2352,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"cousin in the fact. He flew at him and made him relinquish his prey,"
2353,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"though not without much snarling and growling. The fox, who had been"
2354,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"prowling about the henroost, now came up, and began to make"
2355,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"protestations of his own innocence, with heavy reproaches against the"
2356,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"wolf for thus disgracing the family. “Begone, scoundrels both!” cried"
2357,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"Keeper; “I know you now too well. You may be of my blood, but I am sure"
2358,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,you are not of my spirit. Keeper holds no kindred with villains.” So
2359,THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.,"saying, he drove them from the premises."

2368,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"Her disorder was a shortness of breath, proceeding partly from old age,"
2369,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"and partly from fat. As she felt her end approaching, she called her"
2370,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"children to her, and with a great deal of difficulty spoke as follows:—"

2372,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“Before I depart from this world, my children, I mean, if my breath will"
2373,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"give me leave, to relate to you the principal events of my life, as the"
2374,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,variety of scenes I have gone through may afford you some useful
2375,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,instruction for avoiding those dangers to which our species are
2376,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,particularly exposed.
2377,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2378,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“Without further preface, then, I was born at a farmhouse, in a village"
2379,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"some miles hence; and almost as soon as I came into the world, I was"
2380,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,very near leaving it again. My mother brought five of us at a litter;
2381,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"and as the frugal people of the house only kept cats to be useful, and"
2382,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"were already sufficiently stocked, we were immediately doomed to be"
2383,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"drowned; and accordingly, a boy was ordered to take us all and throw us"
2384,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,into the horsepond. This commission he performed with the pleasure boys
2385,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"seem naturally to take in acts of cruelty, and we were presently set a"
2386,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"swimming. While we were struggling for life, a little girl, daughter to"
2387,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"the farmer, came running to the pond-side, and begged very hard that she"
2388,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"might save one of us, and bring him up for her own. After some dispute"
2389,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"her request was granted; and the boy, reaching out his arm, took hold of"
2390,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"me, who was luckily nearest him, and brought me out when I was just"
2391,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"spent. I was laid on the grass, and it was some time before I recovered."
2392,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"The girl then restored me to my mother, who was overjoyed to get again"
2393,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"one of her little ones; and for fear of another mischance, she took me"
2394,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"in her mouth to a dark hole, where she kept me till I could see, and was"
2395,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"able to run by her side. As soon as I came to light again, my little"
2396,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"mistress took possession of me, and tended me very carefully. Her"
2397,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"fondness, indeed, was sometimes troublesome, as she pinched my sides"
2398,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"with carrying me, and once or twice hurt me a good deal by letting me"
2399,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"fall. Soon, however, I became strong and active, and played and"
2400,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"gambolled all day long, to the great delight of my mistress and her"
2401,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,companions.
2402,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2403,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,“At this time I had another narrow escape. A man brought into the house
2404,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"a strange dog, who had been taught to worry all the cats that came in"
2405,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"his way. My mother slunk away at his entrance; but I, thinking, like a"
2406,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"little fool as I was, that I was able to protect myself, stayed on the"
2407,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"floor, growling, and setting up my back by way of defiance. The dog"
2408,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"instantly ran at me, and before I could get my claws ready, seized me"
2409,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"with his mouth, and began to gripe and shake me most terribly. I"
2410,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"screamed out, and, by good luck, my mistress was within hearing. She ran"
2411,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"to us, but was not able to disengage me; however, a servant, seeing her"
2412,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"distress took a great stick, and gave the dog such a bang on the back,"
2413,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"that he was forced to let me go. He had used me so roughly, that I was"
2414,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,not able to stand for some time; but by care and a good constitution I
2415,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,recovered.

2417,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“I was now running after everybody’s heels, by which means I got one day"
2418,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"locked up in the dairy. I was not sorry for this accident, thinking to"
2419,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,feast upon the cream and other good things. But having climbed a shelf
2420,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"to get at a bowl of cream, I unluckily fell backward into a large vessel"
2421,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"of buttermilk, where I should probably have been drowned, had not the"
2422,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"maid heard the noise, and come to see what was the matter. She took me"
2423,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"out, scolding bitterly at me, and after making me undergo a severe"
2424,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"discipline at the pump to clean me, she dismissed me with a good"

2427,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“After a while I began to get into the yard, and my mother took me into"

2429,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"gave me. We sat by a hole, and presently out came a mouse with a brood"

2437,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"gave me such a bite on the nose, that I ran away to my mother mewing"
2438,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"piteously, with my face all bloody and swelled. For some time I did not"
2439,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"meddle with rats again; but at length, growing stronger and more"
2440,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"skilful, I feared neither rats nor any other vermin, and acquired the"
2441,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,reputation of an excellent hunter.
2442,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2443,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,“I had some other escapes about this time. Once I happened to meet with
2444,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"some poisoned food laid for the rats, and eating it, I was thrown into a"
2445,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"disorder that was very near killing me. At another time, I chanced to"
2446,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"set my foot in a rat-trap, and received so many deep wounds from its"
2447,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"teeth, that though I was loosened as gently as possible by the people"
2448,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"who heard me cry, I was rendered lame for some weeks after."
2449,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2450,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“Time went on, and I arrived at my full growth; and forming an"
2451,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"acquaintance with a male-cat about my age, after a decent resistance by"
2452,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"scolding, biting, and scratching, we made a match of it. I became a"
2453,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"mother in due time, and had the mortification of seeing several broods"
2454,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,of my kittens disposed of in the same manner as my brothers and sisters
2455,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,had been. I shall mention two or three more adventures in the order I
2456,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,remember them. I was once prowling for birds along a hedge at some
2457,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"distance from home, when the ‘squire’s grayhounds came that way a"
2458,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"coursing. As soon as they spied me, they set off full speed, and running"
2459,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"much faster than I could do, were just behind me, when I reached a tree,"
2460,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,and saved myself by climbing it. But a greater danger befell me on
2461,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,meeting with a parcel of boys returning from school. They surrounded me
2462,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"before I was aware, and obliged me to take refuge in a tree; but I soon"
2463,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,found that a poor defence against such enemies; for they assembled about
2464,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"it, and threw stones on all sides, so that I could not avoid receiving"
2465,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"many hard blows, one of which brought me senseless to the ground. The"
2466,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"biggest boy now seized me, and proposed to the rest making what he"
2467,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"called rare sport with me. This sport was to tie me to a board, and"
2468,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"launching me on a pond, to set some water-dogs at me, who were to duck"
2469,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"and half drown me, while I was to defend myself by biting their noses,"
2470,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"and scratching their eyes. Already was I bound, and just ready to be set"
2471,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"a sailing when the schoolmaster taking a walk that way, and seeing the"
2472,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"bustle, came up, and obliged the boys to set me at liberty, severely"
2473,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,reprimanding them for their cruel intentions.
2474,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2475,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,“The next remarkable incident of my life was the occasion of my removal
2476,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"from the country. My mistress’s brother had a tame linnet, of which he"
2477,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,was very fond; for it would come and light on his shoulder when he
2478,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"called for it, and feed out of his hand; and it sung well besides. This"
2479,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,bird was usually either in its cage or upon a high perch; but one
2480,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"unlucky day, when he and I were alone in the room together, he came down"
2481,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"on the table to pick up crumbs. I spied him, and not being able to"
2482,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"resist the temptation, sprung at him, and catching him in my claws, soon"
2483,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,began to devour him. I had almost finished when his master came into the
2484,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"room; and seeing me with the remains of poor linnet in my mouth, he ran"
2485,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"to me in the greatest fury, and after chasing me several times round the"
2486,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"room, at length caught me. He was proceeding instantly to hang me, when"
2487,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"his sister, by many entreaties and tears, persuaded him, after a good"
2488,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"whipping, to forgive me, upon the promise that I should be sent away."
2489,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"Accordingly, the next market-day I was despatched in the cart to a"
2490,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"relation of theirs in this town, who wanted a good cat, as the house was"
2491,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,overrun with mice.
2492,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2493,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“In the service of this family I continued a good while, performing my"
2494,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"duty as a mouser extremely well, so that I was in high esteem. I soon"
2495,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"became acquainted with all the particulars of a town life, and"
2496,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"distinguished my activity in climbing walls and houses, and jumping from"
2497,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"roof to roof, either in pursuit of prey, or upon gossiping parties with"
2498,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"my companions. Once, however, I had like to have suffered for my"
2499,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"venturing; for having made a great jump from one house to another, I lit"
2500,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"upon a loose tile, which giving way with me, I fell from a vast height"
2501,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"into the street, and should certainly have been killed, had I not had"
2502,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"the luck to light in a dung-cart, whence I escaped with no other injury"
2503,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,but being half stifled with filth.
2504,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2505,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“Notwithstanding the danger I had run from killing the linnet, I am"
2506,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,sorry to confess that I was again guilty of a similar offence. I
2507,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,contrived one night to leap down from a roof upon the board of some
2508,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"pigeon-holes, which led to a garret inhabited by those birds. I entered,"
2509,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"and finding them asleep, made sad havoc among all that were within my"
2510,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"reach, killing and sucking the blood of near a dozen. I was near paying"
2511,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"dearly for this, too; for on attempting to return, I found it was"
2512,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"impossible for me to leap up again to the place whence I had descended,"
2513,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"so that, after several dangerous trials, I was obliged to wait trembling"
2514,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"in the place where I had committed all these murders, till the owner"
2515,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,came up in the morning to feed his pigeons. I rushed out between his
2516,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"legs as soon as the door was opened, and had the good fortune to get"
2517,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"safe down stairs, and make my escape through a window unknown; but never"
2518,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,shall I forget the horrors I felt that night! Let my double danger be a
2519,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"warning to you, my children, to control your savage appetites, and on no"
2520,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"account to do harm to those creatures which, like ourselves, are under"
2521,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,the protection of man. We cats all lie under a bad name for treacherous
2522,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"dispositions in this respect, and with shame I must acknowledge it is"
2523,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,but too well merited.
2524,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2525,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“Well—but my breath begins to fail me, and I must hasten to a"
2526,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"conclusion. I still lived in the same family, when our present kind"
2527,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"mistress, Mrs. Petlove, having lost a favourite tabby, advertised a very"
2528,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"handsome price for another, that should as nearly as possible resemble"
2529,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"her dead darling. My owners, tempted by the offer, took me for the good"
2530,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"lady’s inspection, and I had the honour of being preferred to a"
2531,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,multitude of rivals. I was immediately settled in the comfortable
2532,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"mansion we now inhabit, and had many favours and indulgences bestowed"
2533,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"upon me, such as I had never before experienced. Among these I reckon"
2534,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"one of the principal that of being allowed to rear all my children, and"
2535,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,to see them grow up in peace and plenty. My adventures here have been
2536,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,few; for after the monkey had spitefully bit off the last joint of my
2537,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"tail, (for which I had the satisfaction to see him soundly corrected,) I"
2538,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,kept beyond the length of his chain; and neither the parrot nor lapdogs
2539,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,ever dared to molest me. One of the greatest afflictions I have felt
2540,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"here was the stifling of a whole litter of my kittens by a fat old lady,"
2541,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"a friend of my mistress, who sat down on the chair where they lay, and"
2542,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"never perceived the mischief she was doing till she rose, though I"
2543,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,pulled her clothes and used all the means in my power to show my
2544,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,uneasiness. This misfortune my mistress took to heart almost as much as
2545,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"myself, and the lady has never since entered our doors. Indeed, both I"
2546,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,and mine had ever been treated here with the utmost kindness—perhaps
2547,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"with too much; for, to the pampering me with delicacies, together with"
2548,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"Mrs. Abigail’s frequent washings, I attribute this asthma, which is now"
2549,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,putting an end to my life rather sooner than its natural period. But I
2550,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,know all was meant well; and with my last breath I charge you all to
2551,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"show your gratitude to our worthy mistress, by every return in your"
2552,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,power.
2553,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2554,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"“And now, my dear children, farewell; we shall perhaps meet again in a"
2555,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"land where there are no dogs to worry us, or boys to torment us—Adieu!”"
2556,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,
2557,THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.,"Having thus said, Grimalkin became speechless, and presently departed"

2573,PERSONS.,

2580,PERSONS.,
2581,PERSONS.,"_Offa._ Not only we, but even the elements, are your slaves. The land"
2582,PERSONS.,obeys you from shore to shore; and the sea obeys you.
2583,PERSONS.,
2584,PERSONS.,"_Canute._ Does the sea, with its loud boisterous waves, obey me? Will"

2586,PERSONS.,
2587,PERSONS.,"_Offa._ Yes, the sea is yours; it was made to bear your ships upon its"

2593,PERSONS.,"_Oswald._ Yes, my liege; you may perceive the swell already."

2595,PERSONS.,"_Canute._ Bring me a chair, then; set it here upon the sands."

2604,PERSONS.,
2605,PERSONS.,"_Canute._ O, mighty ocean! thou art my subject: my courtiers tell me so;"
2606,PERSONS.,"and it is thy bounden duty to obey me. Thus, then, I stretch my sceptre"

2608,PERSONS.,"let them presume to wet the feet of me, thy royal master."
2609,PERSONS.,
2610,PERSONS.,_Oswald_ (_aside_). I believe the sea will pay very little regard to his

2612,PERSONS.,
2613,PERSONS.,_Offa._ See how fast the tide rises!
2614,PERSONS.,
2615,PERSONS.,_Oswald._ The next wave will come up to the chair. It is folly to stay;
2616,PERSONS.,we shall be covered with salt water.
2617,PERSONS.,
2618,PERSONS.,"_Canute._ Well, does the sea obey my commands? If it be my subject, it"
2619,PERSONS.,is a very rebellious subject. See how it swells and dashes the angry
2620,PERSONS.,foam and salt spray over my sacred person. Vile sycophants! did you
2621,PERSONS.,think I was the dupe of your base lies? that I believed your abject
2622,PERSONS.,"flatteries? Know, there is only one Being whom the sea will obey. He is"
2623,PERSONS.,"sovereign of heaven and earth, King of kings, and Lord of lords. It is"
2624,PERSONS.,"only he who can say to the ocean—“Thus far shalt thou go, but no"
2625,PERSONS.,"farther, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.” A king is but a man;"
2626,PERSONS.,"and a man is but a worm. Shall a worm assume the power of the great God,"
2627,PERSONS.,"and think the elements will obey him? Take away this crown, I will never"

2642,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2643,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ But I had rather write now, mamma, or read, or get my French"
2644,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,grammar.
2645,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2646,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ I know very well what that means, Kitty; you had rather do anything"
2647,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,than what I set you about.
2648,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2649,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ No, mamma; but you know I can work very well already, and I have a"
2650,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,great many more things to learn. There’s Miss Rich that cannot sew half
2651,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"so well as I, and she is learning music and drawing already, besides"
2652,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"dancing, and I don’t know how many other things. She tells me that they"
2653,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,hardly work at all in their school.
2654,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2655,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Your tongue runs at a great rate, my dear; but, in the first place,"
2656,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"you cannot sew very well for if you could, you would not have been so"
2657,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,long in doing this little piece. Then I hope you will allow that mammas
2658,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,know better what is proper for their little girls to learn than they do
2659,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,themselves?
2660,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2661,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ To be sure, mamma; but as I suppose I must learn all these things"
2662,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"some time or other, I thought you would like to have me begin them soon,"
2663,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,for I have often heard you say that children cannot be set too early
2664,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,about what is necessary for them to do.
2665,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2666,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_M._ That’s very true; but all things are not equally necessary to every
2667,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"one; for some that are very fit for one, are scarcely proper at all for"
2668,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,others.
2669,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2670,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Why, mamma?"
2671,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2672,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Because, my dear, it is the purpose of all education to fit persons"
2673,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,for the station in which they are hereafter to live; and you know there
2674,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"are very great differences in that respect, both among men and women."
2675,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2676,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_K._ Are there? I thought all _ladies_ lived alike.
2677,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2678,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ It is usual to call all well-educated women, who have no occasion"
2679,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"to work for their livelihood, _ladies_; but, if you will think a little,"
2680,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"you must see that they live very differently from each other, for their"
2681,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,fathers and husbands are in very different ranks and situations in the
2682,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"world, you know."
2683,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2684,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Yes, I know that some are lords, and some are ‘squires, and some"
2685,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"are clergymen, and some are merchants, and some are doctors, and some"
2686,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,are shopkeepers.
2687,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2688,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_M._ Well: and do you think the wives and daughters of these persons can
2689,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"have just the same things to do, and the same duties to perform? You"
2690,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,know how I spend my time. I have to go to market and provide for the
2691,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"family, to look after the servants, to help in taking care of you"
2692,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"children, and in teaching you to see that your clothes are in proper"
2693,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"condition, and assist in making and mending for myself, and you, and"
2694,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"your papa. All this is my necessary duty; and besides this, I must go"
2695,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"out a visiting to keep up our acquaintance; this I call partly business,"
2696,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"and partly amusement. Then when I am tired, and have done all that I"
2697,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"think necessary, I may amuse myself with reading, or in any other proper"
2698,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,way. Now a great many of these employments do not belong to Lady
2699,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"Wealthy, or Mrs. Rich, who keep housekeepers and governesses, and"
2700,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"servants of all kinds, to do everything for them. It is very proper,"
2701,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"therefore, for them to pay more attention to music, drawing, ornamental"
2702,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"work, and any other elegant manner of passing their time and making"
2703,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,themselves agreeable.
2704,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2705,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ And shall I have all the same things to do, mamma, that you have?"
2706,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2707,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ It is impossible, my dear, to foresee what your future station will"
2708,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,be; but you have no reason to expect that if you have a family you will
2709,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,have fewer duties to perform than I have. This is the way of life for
2710,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,which your education should prepare you; and everything will be useful
2711,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"and important for you to learn, in proportion as it will make you fit"
2712,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,for this.
2713,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2714,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ But when I am grown a young lady, shall I not have to visit, and go"
2715,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"to assemblies and plays, as Miss Wilsons and Miss Johnsons do?"
2716,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2717,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_M._ It is very likely you may enter into some amusement of this sort:
2718,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"but even then you will have several more serious employments, which will"
2719,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,take up a much greater part of your time; and if you do not do them
2720,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"properly, you will have no right to partake of the others."
2721,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2722,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ What will they be, mamma?"
2723,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2724,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Why, don’t you think it proper that you should assist me in my"
2725,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"household affairs a little, as soon as you are able?"
2726,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2727,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ O yes, mamma, I should be very glad to do that."
2728,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2729,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Well, consider what talents will be necessary for that purpose;"
2730,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,will not a good hand at your needle be one of the very first qualities?
2731,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2732,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_K._ I believe it will.
2733,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2734,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Yes, and not only in assisting _me_, but in making things for"

2736,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"with us, in contriving and making so many articles of her dress, for"
2737,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"which she must otherwise have gone to the milliner’s, which would have"
2738,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,cost a great deal of money.
2739,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2740,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Yes; she made my pretty bonnet, and she made you a very handsome"
2741,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,cap.
2742,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2743,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_M._ Very true; she was so clever as not only to furnish herself with
2744,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"these things, but to oblige her friends with some of her work. And I"
2745,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,dare say she does a great deal of plain work also for herself and her
2746,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"mother. Well, then, you are convinced of the importance of this"
2747,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"business, I hope."
2748,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2749,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Yes, mamma."
2750,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2751,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Reading and writing are such necessary parts of education, that I"
2752,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,need not say much to you about them.
2753,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2754,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ O no, for I love reading dearly."
2755,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2756,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ I know you do, if you can get entertaining stories to read, but"
2757,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"there are many things also to be read for instruction, which perhaps may"
2758,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,not be so pleasant at first.
2759,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2760,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_K._ But what need is there of so many books of this sort?
2761,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2762,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Some are to teach you your duty to your Maker, and your"
2763,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"fellow-creatures, of which I hope you are sensible you ought not to be"
2764,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,ignorant. Then it is very right to be acquainted with geography; for you
2765,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,remember how poor Miss Blunder was laughed at for saying that if ever
2766,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"she went to France, it should be by land."
2767,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2768,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ That was because England is an island, and all surrounded with"
2769,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"water, was it not?"
2770,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2771,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Yes, Great Britain, which contains both England and Scotland, is an"
2772,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"island. Well, it is very useful to knew something of the nature of"
2773,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"plants, and animals, and minerals, because we are always using some or"
2774,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"other of them. Something, too, of the heavenly bodies is very proper to"
2775,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"be known, both that we may admire the power and wisdom of God in"
2776,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"creating them, and that we may not make foolish mistakes, when their"
2777,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,natures and properties are the subject of conversation. The knowledge of
2778,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"history too, is very important, especially that of our own country; and"
2779,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"in short, everything that makes part of the discourse of rational and"
2780,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"well-educated people, ought in some degree to be studied by every one"
2781,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,who has proper opportunities.
2782,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2783,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Yes, I like some of those things very well. But pray, mamma, what"
2784,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,do I learn French for—am I ever to live in France?
2785,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2786,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Probably not, my dear; but there are a great many books written in"
2787,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,French that are very well worth reading; and it may every now and then
2788,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,happen that you may be in company with foreigners who cannot speak
2789,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"English, and as they almost all talk French, you may be able to converse"
2790,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,with them in that language.
2791,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2792,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Yes, I remember there was a gentleman here that came from Germany,"
2793,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"I think, and he could hardly speak a word of English, but papa and you"
2794,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,could talk to him in French; and I wished very much to be able to
2795,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"understand what you were saying, for I believe part of it was about me."
2796,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2797,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ It was. Well, then, you see the use of French. But I cannot say"
2798,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"this is a _necessary_ part of knowledge to young women in general, only"
2799,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"it is well worth acquiring, if a person has leisure and opportunity. I"
2800,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"will tell you, however, what is quite necessary for one in your station,"
2801,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"and that is, to write a good hand, and to cast accounts well."
2802,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2803,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ I should like to write well, because then I should send letters to"
2804,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"my friends when I pleased, and it would not be such a scrawl as our maid"
2805,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"Betty writes, that I dare say her friends can hardly make it out."
2806,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2807,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ She had not the advantage of learning when young, for you know she"
2808,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"taught herself since she came to us, which was a very sensible thing of"
2809,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"her, and I suppose she will improve. Well, but accounts are almost as"
2810,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,necessary as writing; for how could I cast up all the market-bills and
2811,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"tradesman’s accounts, and keep my housebooks, without it?"
2812,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2813,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ And what is the use of that, mamma?"
2814,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2815,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ It is of use to prevent our being overcharged in anything, and to"
2816,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"know exactly how much we spend, and whether or not we are exceeding our"
2817,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"income, and in what articles we ought to be more saving. Without keeping"
2818,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"accounts the richest man might soon come to be ruined, before he knew"
2819,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,that his affairs were going wrong.
2820,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2821,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_K._ But do women always keep accounts? I thought that was generally the
2822,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,business of the men.
2823,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2824,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ It is their business to keep the accounts belonging to their trade,"
2825,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"or profession, or estate; but it is the business of their wives to keep"
2826,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"all the household accounts; and a woman almost in any rank, unless,"
2827,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"perhaps, some of the highest of all, is to blame if she does not take"
2828,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,upon her this necessary office. I remember a remarkable instance of the
2829,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,benefit which a young lady derived from an attention to this point. An
2830,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,eminent merchant in London failed for a great sum!
2831,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2832,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ What does that mean, mamma?"
2833,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2834,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ That he owed a great deal more than he could pay. His creditors,"
2835,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"that is, those to whom he was indebted, on examining his accounts, found"
2836,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,great deficiencies which they could not make out; for he had kept his
2837,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"books very irregularly, and had omitted to put down many things that he"
2838,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"had bought and sold. They suspected, therefore, that great waste had"
2839,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,been made in the family expenses; and they were the more suspicious of
2840,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"this, as a daughter, who was a very genteel young lady, was his"
2841,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"housekeeper, his wife being dead. She was told of this; upon which, when"
2842,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"the creditors were all met, she sent them her housebooks for their"
2843,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"examination. They were all written in a very fair hand, and every single"
2844,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"article was entered with the greatest regularity, and the sums were all"
2845,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,cast up with perfect exactness. The gentlemen were so highly pleased
2846,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"with the proof of the young lady’s ability, that they all agreed to make"
2847,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,her a handsome present out of the effects; and one of the richest of
2848,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"them, who was in want of a clever wife, soon after paid his addresses to"
2849,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"her, and married her."
2850,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2851,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ That was very lucky, for I suppose she took care of her poor father"
2852,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,when she was rich. But I shall have nothing of that sort to do a great
2853,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,while.
2854,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2855,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,_M._ No; but young women should keep their own account of clothes and
2856,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"pocket-money, and other expenses, as I intend you shall do when you grow"
2857,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,up.
2858,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2859,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Am I not to learn dancing, and music, and drawing, too, mamma?"
2860,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2861,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Dancing you shall certainly learn pretty soon, because it is not"
2862,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"only an agreeable accomplishment in itself, but is useful in forming the"
2863,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"body to ease and elegance in all its motions. As to the other two, they"
2864,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"are merely ornamental accomplishments, which, though a woman of middling"
2865,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"station may be admired for possessing, yet she will never be censured"
2866,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,for being without. The propriety of attempting to acquire them must
2867,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"depend on natural genius for them, and upon leisure and other accidental"
2868,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"circumstances. For some they are too expensive, and many are unable to"
2869,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,make such progress in them as will repay the pains of beginning. It is
2870,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"soon enough, however, for us to think about these things, and at any"
2871,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,rate they are not to come in till you have made a very good proficiency
2872,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,in what is useful and necessary. But I see you have now finished what I
2873,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"set you about, so you shall take a walk with me into the marketplace,"
2874,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,where I have two or three things to buy.
2875,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2876,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_K._ Shall we not call at the bookseller’s, to inquire for those new"
2877,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,books that Miss Reader was talking about?
2878,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,
2879,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,"_M._ Perhaps we may. Now lay up your work neatly, and get on your hat"
2880,BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.,and tippet.

2895,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2896,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,

2898,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"don’t know how your young legs feel, but mine are almost tired."
2899,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2900,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ I am not tired, but I am very hot."
2901,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2902,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ And I am hot and very dry, too."
2903,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2904,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ When you have cooled yourself, you may drink out of that clear"
2905,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"brook. In the meantime, we will read a little out of a book I have in my"
2906,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,pocket. [_They go and sit down at the foot of the tree._]
2907,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2908,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ What an amazing large tree! How wide its branches spread! Pray
2909,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,what tree is it?
2910,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2911,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I can tell you that. It is an oak. Don’t you see the acorns?
2912,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2913,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Yes, it is an oak—the noblest tree this country produces; not"
2914,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"only grand and beautiful to the sight, but of the greatest importance"
2915,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,from its uses.
2916,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2917,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ I should like to know something about it?
2918,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2919,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Very well; then instead of reading we will sit and talk about
2920,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"oaks. George, who knew the oak by its acorns—should you have known it if"
2921,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,there had been none?
2922,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2923,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I don’t know; I believe not.
2924,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2925,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Observe, then, in the first place, that its bark is very rugged."
2926,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,Then see in what manner it grows: its great arms run out almost
2927,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"horizontally from its trunk, giving the whole tree a sort of round form,"
2928,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,and making it spread far on every side. Its branches are also subject to
2929,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,be crooked or kneed. By these marks you might guess at an oak even in
2930,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"winter, when quite bare of leaves. But its leaves afford a surer mark of"
2931,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"distinction, since they differ a good deal from those of other English"
2932,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"trees, being neither whole and even at the edges, nor yet cut like the"
2933,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"teeth of a saw, but rather deeply scolloped, and formed into several"
2934,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,rounded divisions. Their colour is a fine deep green. Then the fruit—
2935,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2936,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Fruit!
2937,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2938,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Yes; all kinds of plants have what may properly be called fruit,"
2939,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,though we are apt to give that name only to such as are food for man.
2940,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"The fruit of a plant is the seed, with what contains it. This, in the"
2941,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"oak, is called an acorn, which is a kind of nut, partly enclosed in a"
2942,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,cup.
2943,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2944,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ Acorn-cups are very pretty things. I have made boats of them, and"
2945,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,set them swimming in a basin.
2946,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2947,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ And if you were no bigger than a fairy, you might use them for"
2948,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"drinking cups, as those imaginary little beings are said to do."
2949,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2950,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"Pearly drops of dew we drink,"
2951,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,In acorn-cups filled to the brink.
2952,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2953,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Are acorns good to eat?
2954,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2955,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ No; that they are not. I have tried, and did not like them at"
2956,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,all.
2957,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2958,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ In the early ages of man, before he cultivated the earth, but"
2959,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"lived upon such wild products as Nature afforded, we are told that"
2960,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,acorns made a considerable part of his food; and at this day they are
2961,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"eaten in Spain and Greece, and in some other of the southern countries"
2962,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"of Europe. But they are sweeter and better flavoured than ours, and are"
2963,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,produced by a different species of oak. The chief use which we make of
2964,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,those which grow in this country is to feed hogs. In those parts of
2965,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"England where oak-woods are common, great herds of swine are kept, which"
2966,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"are driven into the woods in autumn, when the acorns fall, and provide"
2967,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"for themselves plentifully for two or three months. This, however, is a"
2968,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,small part of the praise of the oak. You will be surprised when I tell
2969,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,you that to this tree our country owes its chief glory and security.
2970,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2971,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Ay! how can that be?
2972,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2973,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ I don’t know whether in your reading you have ever met with the
2974,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"story, that Athens, a famous city in Greece, consulting the oracle how"
2975,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"it might best defend itself against its enemies, was advised to trust to"
2976,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,wooden walls.
2977,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2978,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Wooden walls? that’s odd. I should think stone-walls better; for
2979,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,wooden ones might be set on fire.
2980,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2981,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ True: but the meaning was, that as Athens was a place of great"
2982,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"trade, and its people were skilled in maritime affairs, they ought to"
2983,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"trust to their ships. Well, this is the case with Great Britain. As it"
2984,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"is an island, it has no need of walls and fortifications, while it"
2985,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"possesses ships to keep all enemies at a distance. Now, we have the"
2986,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"greatest and finest navy in the world, by which we both defend"
2987,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"ourselves, and attack other nations, when they insult us; and this is"
2988,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,all built of oak.
2989,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2990,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Would no other wood do to build ships?
2991,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
2992,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ None nearly so well, especially for men-of-war; for it is the"
2993,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"stoutest and strongest wood we have; and, therefore, best fitted, both"
2994,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"to keep sound under water, and to bear the blows and shocks of the"
2995,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"waves, and the terrible strokes of cannon-balls. It is a peculiar"
2996,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"excellence for this last purpose, that oak is not so liable to splinter"
2997,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"or shiver as other woods, so that a ball can pass through it without"
2998,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"making a large hole. Did you never hear the old song,"
2999,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3000,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"Hearts of oak are our ships, hearts of oak are our men, &c.?"
3001,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3002,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ No.
3003,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3004,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ It was made at a time when England was more successful in war
3005,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"than had ever before been known, and our success was properly attributed"
3006,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"chiefly to our fleet, the great support of which is the British oak so I"
3007,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,hope you will look upon oaks with due respect.
3008,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3009,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Yes; it shall always be my favourite tree.
3010,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3011,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Had not Pope reason, when he said, in his _Windsor Forest_,"
3012,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3013,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"“Let India boast her plants, nor envy we"
3014,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"The weeping amber, or the balmy tree,"
3015,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"While by our oaks the precious loads are borne,"
3016,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,And realms commanded which those trees adorn!”
3017,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3018,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,These lines refer to its use as well for merchant-ships as for
3019,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"men-of-war; and, in fact, all our ships are for the most part built"
3020,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,either of native or foreign oak.
3021,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3022,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Are the masts of ships made of oak?
3023,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3024,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ No; it would be too heavy. Besides, it would not be easy to find"
3025,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,trunks of oak long and straight enough for that purpose. They are made
3026,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"of various sorts of fir or pine, which grow very tall and taper."
3027,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3028,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Is oak wood used for anything besides ship-building?
3029,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3030,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ O yes; it is one of the principal woods of the carpenter, being"
3031,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,employed wherever great strength and durability are required. It is used
3032,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"for door and window frames, and the beams that are laid in walls to"
3033,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,strengthen them. Floors and staircases are sometimes made with it; and
3034,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"in old houses in the country, which were built when oak was more"
3035,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"plentiful than at present, almost all the timber about them was oak. It"
3036,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"is also occasionally used for furniture, as tables, chairs, drawers, and"
3037,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,bedsteads; though mahogany has now much taken its place for the better
3038,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"sort of goods, and the lighter and softer woods for the cheaper; for the"
3039,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"hardness of oak renders it difficult and expensive to work. It is still,"
3040,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"however, the chief material used in mill-work, in bridge and water"
3041,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"works, for wagon and cart bodies, for threshing-floors, for large casks"
3042,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"and tubs, and for the last piece of furniture a man has occasion for."
3043,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"What is that, do you think, George?"
3044,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3045,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I don’t know.
3046,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3047,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ A coffin.
3048,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3049,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ So it is.
3050,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3051,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ But why should that be made of such strong wood?
3052,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3053,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ There can be no other reason than that weak attachment we are apt
3054,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"to have for our bodies when we are done with them, which has made men in"
3055,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,various countries desirous of keeping them as long as possible from
3056,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,decay. But I have not yet done with the uses of the oak. Were either of
3057,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,you ever in a tanner’s yard?
3058,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3059,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ We often go by one at the end of the town; but we dare not go in
3060,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,for fear of the great dog.
3061,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3062,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ But he is always chained in the daytime.
3063,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3064,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ Yes; but he barks so loud and looks so fierce, that we were"
3065,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,afraid he would break his chain.
3066,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3067,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ I doubt you are a couple of cowards. However, I suppose you came"
3068,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,near enough to observe great stacks of bark in the yard.
3069,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3070,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ O yes; there are several.
3071,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3072,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Those are oak-bark, and it is used in tanning the hides."
3073,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3074,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ What does it do to them?
3075,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3076,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ I’ll tell you. The hide, when taken from the animal, after being"
3077,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"steeped in lime and water to get off the hair and grease, is put to soak"
3078,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,in a liquor made by steeping oak-bark in water. This liquor is strongly
3079,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"astringent, or binding, and has the property of converting skin into"
3080,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,leather. The change which the hide thus undergoes renders it at the same
3081,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"time less liable to decay, and soft and pliable when dry; for raw skins,"
3082,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"by drying, acquire nearly the hardness and consistence of horn. Other"
3083,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"things are also tanned for the purpose of preserving them, as"
3084,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,fishing-nets and boat-sails. This use of the bark of the oak makes it a
3085,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,very valuable commodity; and you may see people in the woods carefully
3086,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"stripping the oaks when cut down, and piling up the bark in heaps."
3087,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3088,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ I have seen such heaps of bark, but I thought they were only to"
3089,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,burn.
3090,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3091,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ No; they are much too valuable for that. Well, but I have another"
3092,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"use of the oak to mention, and that is in dying."
3093,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3094,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Dying! I wonder what colour it can die?
3095,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3096,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Oak sawdust is a principal ingredient in dying fustians. By
3097,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,various mixtures and management it is made to give them all the
3098,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"different shades of drab and brown. Then, all the parts of the oak, like"
3099,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"all other astringent vegetables, produce a dark blue or black by the"
3100,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,addition of any preparation of iron. The bark is sometimes used in this
3101,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,way for dying black. And did you never see what the boys call an
3102,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,oak-apple?
3103,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3104,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Yes; I have gathered them myself.
3105,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3106,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Do you know what they are?
3107,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3108,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I thought they were the fruit of the oak.
3109,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3110,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ No; I have told you that the acorns are the fruits. These are
3111,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,excrescences formed by an insect.
3112,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3113,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ An insect! how can they make such a thing?
3114,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3115,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ It is a sort of fly, that has the power of piercing the outer"
3116,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"skin of the oak boughs, under which it lays its eggs. The part then"
3117,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"swells into a kind of ball, and the young insects, when hatched, eat"
3118,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"their way out. Well this ball or apple is a pretty strong astringent,"
3119,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,and is sometimes used in dying black. But in the warm countries there is
3120,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"a species of oak which bears round excrescences of the same kind, called"
3121,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"galls, which become hard, and are the strongest astringents known. They"
3122,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"are the principal ingredients in the black dies, and common ink is made"
3123,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"with them, together with a substance called green vitriol, or copperas,"
3124,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,which contains iron.
3125,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3126,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,I have now told you the chief uses that I can recollect of the oak; and
3127,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"these are so important, that whoever drops an acorn into the ground, and"
3128,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"takes proper care of it when it comes up, may be said to be a benefactor"
3129,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"to his country. Besides, no sight can be more beautiful and majestic"
3130,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,than a fine oak-wood. It is an ornament fit for the habitation of the
3131,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,first nobleman in the land.
3132,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3133,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ I wonder, then, that all rich gentlemen who have ground enough do"
3134,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,not cover it with oaks.
3135,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3136,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Many of them, especially of late years, have made great"
3137,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,plantations of these trees. But all soils do not suit them; and then
3138,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,there is another circumstance which prevents many from being at this
3139,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"trouble and expense, which is the long time an oak takes in growing, so"
3140,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,that no person can reasonably expect to profit by those of his own
3141,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"planting. An oak of fifty years is greatly short of its full growth, and"
3142,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"they are scarcely arrived at perfection under a century. However, it is"
3143,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,our duty to think of posterity as well as ourselves; and they who
3144,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"receive oaks from their ancestors, ought certainly to furnish others to"
3145,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,their successors.
3146,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3147,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Then I think that every one who cuts down an oak should be
3148,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,obliged to plant another.
3149,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3150,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Very right—but he should plant two or three for one, for fear of"
3151,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,accidents in their growing.
3152,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3153,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,I will now repeat to you some verses describing the oak in its state of
3154,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"full growth, or rather of beginning to decay, with the various animals"
3155,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,living upon it—and then we will walk.
3156,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,
3157,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"“See where yon _Oak_ its awful structure rears,"
3158,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,The massy growth of twice a hundred years;
3159,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"Survey his rugged trunk with moss o’ergrown,"
3160,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"His lusty arms in rude disorder thrown,"
3161,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"His forking branches wide at distance spread,"
3162,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"And dark’ning half the sky, his lofty head."
3163,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"A mighty castle, built by Nature’s hands,"
3164,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"Peopled by various living tribes, he stands."
3165,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"His airy top the clamorous rooks invest,"
3166,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,And crowd the waving boughs with many a nest.
3167,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,Midway the nimble squirrel builds his bower;
3168,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,And sharp-billed pies the insect tribes devour
3169,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,"That gnaw beneath the bark their secret ways,"
3170,ON THE OAK.—A DIALOGUE.,While unperceived the stately pile decays.”

3187,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3188,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ How retired and quiet is everything in this little spot! The
3189,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,river winds its silent waters round this retreat; and the tangled bushes
3190,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,of the thicket fence it from the attack of an enemy. The bloody Danes
3191,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,have not yet pierced into this wild solitude. I believe I am safe from
3192,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"their pursuit. But I hope I shall find some inhabitants here, otherwise"
3193,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"I shall die of hunger. Ha! here is a narrow path through the wood, and I"
3194,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,think I see the smoke of a cottage rising between the trees. I will bend
3195,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,my steps thither.

3201,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3202,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ Good even to you, good man. Are you disposed to show"
3203,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,hospitality to a poor traveller?
3204,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3205,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Why truly there are so many poor travellers now-a-days, that if"
3206,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"we entertain them all, we shall have nothing left for ourselves."
3207,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"However, come along to my wife, and we will see what can be done for"
3208,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"you. Wife, I am very weary: I have been chopping wood all day."
3209,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3210,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ You are always ready for your supper, but it is not ready"
3211,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"for you, I assure you: the cakes will take an hour to bake, and the sun"
3212,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,is yet high; it has not yet dipped behind the old barn. But who have you
3213,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"with you, I trow?"
3214,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3215,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ Good mother, I am a stranger; and entreat you to afford me"
3216,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,food and shelter.
3217,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3218,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Good mother, quotha! Good wife, if you please, and welcome."
3219,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,But I do not love strangers; and the land has no reason to love them. It
3220,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,has never been a merry day for Old England since strangers came into it.
3221,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3222,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ I am not a stranger in England, though I am a stranger here. I"
3223,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,am a trueborn Englishman.
3224,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3225,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ And do you hate those wicked Danes, that eat us up, and burn"
3226,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"our houses, and drive away our cattle?"
3227,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3228,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I do hate them.
3229,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3230,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Heartily! he does not speak heartily, husband."
3231,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3232,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ Heartily I hate them; most heartily.
3233,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3234,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Give me thy hand, then; thou art an honest fellow."
3235,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3236,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I was with King Alfred in the last battle he fought.
3237,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,

3239,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3240,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ What is become of our good king?
3241,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3242,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ Did you love him, then?"
3243,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3244,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Yes, as much as a poor man may love a king; and kneeled down"
3245,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"and prayed for him every night, that he might conquer those Danish"
3246,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,wolves; but it was not to be so.
3247,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3248,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ You could not love Alfred better than I did.
3249,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3250,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ But what is become of him?
3251,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3252,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ He is thought to be dead.
3253,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3254,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Well, these are sad times; Heaven help us! Come, you shall be"
3255,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,welcome to share the brown loaf with us; I suppose you are too sharp set
3256,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,to be nice.
3257,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3258,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Ay, come with us; you shall be as welcome as a prince! But"
3259,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"hark ye, husband; though I am very willing to be charitable to this"
3260,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"stranger, (it would be a sin to be otherwise,) yet there is no reason he"
3261,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,should not do something to maintain himself: he looks strong and
3262,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,capable.
3263,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3264,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Why, that’s true. What can you do, friend?"
3265,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3266,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I am very willing to help you in anything you choose to set me
3267,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,about. It will please me best to earn my bread before I eat it.
3268,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3269,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ Let me see. Can you tie up fagots neatly?
3270,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3271,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I have not been used to it. I am afraid I should be awkward.
3272,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3273,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ Can you thatch? There is a piece blown off the cowhouse.
3274,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3275,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ Alas! I cannot thatch.
3276,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3277,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gandelin._ Ask him if he can weave rushes: we want some new baskets.
3278,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3279,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I have never learned.
3280,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3281,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ Can you stack hay?
3282,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3283,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ No.
3284,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3285,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Why, here’s a fellow! and yet he hath as many pair of hands as"
3286,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"his neighbours. Dame, can you employ him in the house? He might lay wood"
3287,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"on the fire, and rub the tables."
3288,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3289,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Let him watch these cakes, then: I must go and milk the"
3290,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,kine.
3291,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3292,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ And I’ll go and stack the wood, since supper is not ready."
3293,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3294,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ But pray, observe, friend; do not let the cakes burn; turn"
3295,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,them often on the hearth.
3296,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3297,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I shall observe your directions.
3298,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3299,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,ALFRED _alone_.
3300,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3301,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ For myself, I could bear it: but England, my bleeding country,"
3302,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,for thee my heart is wrung with bitter anguish!—From the Humber to the
3303,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,Thames the rivers are stained with blood. My brave soldiers cut to
3304,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"pieces! My poor people—some massacred, others driven from their warm"
3305,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"homes, stripped, abused, insulted; and I, whom Heaven appointed their"
3306,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"shepherd, unable to rescue my defenceless flock from the ravenous jaws"
3307,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,of these devourers! Gracious Heaven! if I am not worthy to save this
3308,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"land from the Danish sword, raise up some other hero to fight with more"
3309,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"success than I have done, and let me spend my life in this obscure"
3310,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"cottage, in these servile offices: I shall be content if England is"
3311,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,happy. O! here come my blunt host and hostess.
3312,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3313,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Enter_ GUBBA _and_ GANDELIN.
3314,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3315,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Help me down with the pail, husband. This new milk, with the"
3316,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"cakes, will make an excellent supper: but, mercy on us, how they are"
3317,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"burnt! black as my shoe; they have not once been turned: you oaf, you"
3318,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"lubber, you lazy loon—"
3319,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3320,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ Indeed, dame, I am sorry for it: but my mind was full of sad"
3321,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,thoughts.
3322,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3323,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Come, wife, you must forgive him; perhaps he is in love. I"
3324,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,remember when I was in love with thee——
3325,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3326,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gandelin._ You remember!
3327,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3328,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Yes, dame, I do remember it, though it is many a long year"
3329,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,since; my mother was making a kettle of furmety—
3330,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3331,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Pr’y thee, hold thy tongue, and let us eat our suppers."
3332,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3333,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ How refreshing is this sweet new milk, and this wholesome"
3334,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,bread!
3335,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3336,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Eat heartily, friend. Where shall we lodge him, Gandelin?"
3337,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3338,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gandelin._ We have but one bed you know; but there is fresh straw in
3339,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,the barn.
3340,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3341,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred_ (_aside_). If I shall not lodge like a king, at least I shall"
3342,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,lodge like a soldier. Alas! how many of my poor soldiers are stretched
3343,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,on the bare ground!
3344,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3345,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gandelin._ What noise do I hear! It is the tramping of horses. Good
3346,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"husband, go and see what is the matter!"
3347,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3348,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ Heaven forbid my misfortunes should bring destruction on this
3349,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,simple family! I had rather have perished in the wood.
3350,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3351,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"GUBBA _returns, followed by_ ELLA, _with his sword drawn_."
3352,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3353,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ Mercy defend us, a sword!"
3354,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3355,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ The Danes! the Danes! O, do not kill us!"
3356,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3357,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Ella_ (_kneeling_). My liege, my lord, my sovereign! have I found you?"
3358,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3359,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred_ (_embracing him_). My brave Ella!
3360,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3361,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Ella._ I bring you good news, my sovereign! Your troops that were shut"
3362,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,up in Kinwith Castle made a desperate sally—the Danes were slaughtered.
3363,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,The fierce Hubba lies gasping on the plain.
3364,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3365,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ Is it possible! Am I yet a king!
3366,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3367,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Ella._ Their famous standard, the Danish raven, is taken; their troops"
3368,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,are panic-struck; the English soldiers call aloud for _Alfred_. Here is
3369,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,a letter which will inform you of more particulars. (_Gives a letter._)
3370,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3371,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba_ (_aside_). What will become of us? Ah! dame, that tongue of"
3372,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,thine has undone us!
3373,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3374,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gandelin._ O, my poor dear husband! we shall all be hanged, that’s"
3375,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,certain. But who could have thought it was the king?
3376,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3377,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba._ Why, Gandelin, do you see we might have guessed he was born to"
3378,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"be a king, or some such great man, because, you know, he was fit for"
3379,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,nothing else.
3380,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3381,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred_ (_coming forward_). God be praised for these tidings! Hope is
3382,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"sprung up out of the depth of despair. O, my friend! shall I again shine"
3383,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,in arms—again fight at the head of my brave Englishmen—lead them on to
3384,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,victory! Our friends shall now lift their heads again.
3385,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3386,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Ella._ Yes, you have many friends, who have long been obliged, like"
3387,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"their master, to skulk in deserts and caves, and wander from cottage to"
3388,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"cottage. When they hear you are alive and in arms again, they will leave"
3389,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"their fastnesses, and flock to your standard."
3390,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3391,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Alfred._ I am impatient to meet them: my people shall be revenged.
3392,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3393,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Gubba and Gandelin_ (_throwing themselves at the feet of_ ALFRED). O,"
3394,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,my lord——
3395,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3396,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gandelin._ We hope your majesty will put us to a merciful death.
3397,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"Indeed, we did not know your majesty’s grace."
3398,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3399,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,_Gubba._ If your majesty could but pardon my wife’s tongue; she means no
3400,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"harm, poor woman!"
3401,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3402,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"_Alfred._ Pardon you, good people! I not only pardon you, but thank you."
3403,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,You have afforded me protection in my distress; and if ever I am seated
3404,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"again on the throne of England, my first care shall be to reward your"
3405,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"hospitality. I am now going to protect _you_. Come, my faithful Ella, to"
3406,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,arms! to arms! My bosom burns to face once more the haughty Dane; and
3407,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"here I vow to Heaven, that I will never sheath the sword against these"
3408,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"robbers, till either I lose my life in this just cause, or"
3409,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,
3410,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,"“Till dove-like peace return to England’s shore,"
3411,PERSONS OF THE DRAMA.,And war and slaughter vex the land no more.”

3424,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3425,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3426,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tutor._ Let us sit down awhile on this bench, and look about us. What a"
3427,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,charming prospect!
3428,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3429,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Harry._ I admire those pleasure-grounds. What beautiful clumps of trees
3430,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,there are in that lawn!
3431,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3432,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_George._ But what a dark gloomy wood that is at the back of the house!
3433,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3434,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ It is a fir plantation; and those trees always look dismal in the
3435,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"summer, when there are so many finer greens to compare them with. But"
3436,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"the winter is their time for show, when other trees are stripped of"
3437,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,their verdure.
3438,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3439,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Then they are evergreens.
3440,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3441,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes; most of the fir tribe are evergreens; and as they are
3442,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"generally natives of cold mountainous countries, they contribute greatly"
3443,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,to cheer the wintry landscape.
3444,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3445,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ You were so good when we walked out last, to tell us a great deal"
3446,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,about oaks. I thought it one of the prettiest lessons I ever heard. I
3447,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,should be glad if you would give us such another about firs.
3448,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3449,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ So should I, too, I’m sure."
3450,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3451,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ With all my heart, and I am pleased that you ask me. Nothing is"
3452,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,so great an encouragement to a tutor as to find his pupils of their own
3453,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,accord seeking after useful knowledge.
3454,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3455,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ And I think it is very useful to know such things as these.
3456,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3457,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Certainly it is. Well, then—you may know the pine or fir tribe in"
3458,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"general at first sight, as most of them are of a bluish-green colour,"
3459,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and all have leaves consisting of a strong narrow pointed blade, which"
3460,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,gives them somewhat of a stiff appearance. Then all of them bear a hard
3461,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"scaly fruit, of a longish or conical form."
3462,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3463,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Are they what we call fir-apples?
3464,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3465,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes; that is one of the names boys give them.
3466,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3467,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ We often pick them up under trees, and throw them at each other."
3468,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3469,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I have sometimes brought home my pocket full to burn. They make a
3470,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,fine clear flame.
3471,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3472,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Well—do you know where the seeds lie in them.
3473,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3474,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ No—have they any?
3475,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3476,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes—at the bottom of every scale lie two winged seeds; but when
3477,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"the scales open, the seeds fall out: so that you can seldom find any in"
3478,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,those you pick up.
3479,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3480,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Are the seeds good for anything?
3481,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3482,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ There is a kind of pine in the south of Europe called the
3483,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_stone-pine_, the kernels of which are eaten, and said to be as sweet as"
3484,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"an almond. And birds pick out the seeds of other sorts, though they are"
3485,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,so well defended by the woody scales.
3486,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3487,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ They must have good strong bills then.
3488,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3489,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Of this tribe of trees a variety of species are found in
3490,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"different countries, and are cultivated in this. But the only kind"
3491,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"native here is the _wild-pine_ or _Scotch-fir_. Of this, there are large"
3492,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,natural forests in the Highlands of Scotland; and the principal
3493,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"plantations consist of it. It is a hardy sort, fit for barren and"
3494,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"mountainous soils, but grows slowly."
3495,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3496,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Geo._ Pray, what are those very tall trees that grow in two rows before"
3497,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,the old hall in our village?
3498,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3499,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ They are the _common_ or _spruce fir_, a native of Norway, and"
3500,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"other northern countries, and one of the loftiest of the tribe. But"
3501,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,observe those trees that grow singly in the grounds opposite to us with
3502,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"widespread branches spreading downward, and trailing on the ground,"
3503,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,thence gradually lessening till the top of the tree ends almost in a
3504,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,point.
3505,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3506,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ What beautiful trees!
3507,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3508,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ They are the Pines called _Larches_, natives of the Alps and"
3509,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"Apennines, introduced into this country about the middle of the last"
3510,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"century, for the purpose, at first, of decorating our gardens, and of"
3511,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"which extensive plantations for timber have since been made, both in"
3512,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"England and Scotland. These are not properly evergreens, as they shed"
3513,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"their leaves in winter, but quickly recover them again. Then we have"
3514,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"besides the _Weymouth pine_, which is the tallest species in America—the"
3515,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_silver fir_, so called from the silvery hue of its foliage—the"
3516,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_pinaster_—and a tree of ancient fame, the _cedar of Lebanon_."
3517,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3518,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ I suppose that is a very great tree?
3519,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3520,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ It grows to a large size, but is slow in coming to its full"
3521,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,growth.
3522,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3523,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Are pines and firs very useful trees?
3524,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3525,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Perhaps the most so of any. By much the greatest part of the wood
3526,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,at present used among us comes from them.
3527,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3528,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ What—more than from the oak?
3529,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3530,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Yes, much more. Almost all the timber used in building houses,"
3531,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"for floors, beams, rafters, and roofs, is fir."
3532,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3533,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Does it all grow in this country?
3534,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3535,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Scarcely any of it. Norway, Sweden, and Russia, are the countries"
3536,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"from which we draw our timber, and a vast trade there is in it. You have"
3537,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,seen timber-yards?
3538,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3539,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ O yes—several.
3540,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3541,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ In them you would observe some very long thick beams, called"
3542,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"balks. These are whole trees, only stripped of the bark and squared. You"
3543,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"would also see great piles of planks and boards, of different lengths"
3544,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and thickness. Those are called _deal_, and are brought over ready sawn"
3545,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,from the countries where they grow. They are of different colours. The
3546,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,white are chiefly from the fir-tree; the yellow and red from the pine.
3547,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3548,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ I suppose there must be great forests of them in those countries,"
3549,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,or else they could not send us so much.
3550,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3551,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Yes: the mountains of Norway are overrun with them, enough for"
3552,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"the supply of all Europe; but on account of their ruggedness, and the"
3553,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"want of roads, it is found impossible to get the trees, when felled,"
3554,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"down to the seacoast, unless they grow near some river."
3555,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3556,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ How do they manage then?
3557,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3558,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ They take the opportunity when the rivers are swelled with rains
3559,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"or melted snow, and tumble the trees into them, when they are carried"
3560,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"down to the mouth of the rivers, where they are stopped by a kind of"
3561,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,pens.
3562,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3563,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ I should like to see them swimming down the stream.
3564,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3565,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes—it would be curious enough; for in some places these torrents
3566,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"roll over rocks, making steep waterfalls, down which the trees are"
3567,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"carried headlong, and do not rise again till they are got to a great"
3568,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"distance; and many of them are broken, and torn to pieces in the"
3569,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,passage.
3570,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3571,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Are these woods used for anything besides building?
3572,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3573,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ For a variety of purposes; such as boxes, trunks, packing-cases,"
3574,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"pales, wainscots, and the like. Deal is a very soft wood, easily worked,"
3575,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"light, and cheap, which makes it preferred for so many uses, though it"
3576,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"is not very durable, and is very liable to split."
3577,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3578,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ Yes—I know my box is made of deal, and the lid is split all to"
3579,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,pieces with driving nails into it.
3580,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3581,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Are ships ever built with fir?
3582,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3583,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ It was one of the first woods made use of for naval purposes; and
3584,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,in the poets you will find the words _pine_ and _fir_ frequently
3585,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"employed to signify _ship_. But as navigation has improved, the stronger"
3586,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and more durable woods have generally taken its place. However, in the"
3587,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"countries where fir is very plentiful, large ships are still built with"
3588,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"it; for though they last but a short time, they cost so little in"
3589,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"proportion, that the profit of a few voyages is sufficient to repay the"
3590,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"expense. Then, from the great lightness of the wood, they swim higher in"
3591,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"the water, and consequently will bear more loading. Most of the large"
3592,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"ships that bring timber from Archangel, in Russia, are built of fir. As"
3593,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"for the masts of ships, those I have already told you are all made of"
3594,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"fir or pine, on account of their straightness and lightness."
3595,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3596,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Are there not some lines in Milton’s _Paradise Lost_ about that?
3597,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3598,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes: the spear of Satan is magnified by a comparison with a lofty
3599,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,pine.
3600,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3601,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"His spear, to equal which the tallest pine,"
3602,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast"
3603,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"Of some great admiral, were but a wand."
3604,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3605,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Har._ I remember, too, that the walking-staff of the giant Polypheme"
3606,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,was a pine.
3607,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3608,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ Ay—so Homer and Ovid tell us, and he must have been a giant"
3609,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"indeed, to use such a stick. Well, so much for the wood of these trees."
3610,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,But I have more to say about their uses.
3611,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3612,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ I am glad of it.
3613,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3614,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ All of the tribe contain a juice of a bitterish taste and strong
3615,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"fragrant smell. This, in some, is so abundant as to flow out from"
3616,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"incisions; when it is called _turpentine_. The larch, in particular,"
3617,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,yields a large quantity. Turpentine is one of the substances called
3618,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"resinous; it is sticky, transparent, very inflammable, and will not mix"
3619,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_with_ water, but will dissolve in spirits of wine."
3620,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3621,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ What is it used for?
3622,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3623,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ It is used medicinally, particularly in the composition of"
3624,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"plasters and ointments. It also is an ingredient in varnishes, cements,"
3625,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and the like. An oil distilled from turpentine is employed in medicine,"
3626,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,and is much used by painters for mixing up their colours. What remains
3627,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,after getting this oil is common _resin_. All these substances take fire
3628,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"very easily, and burn with a great flame; and the wood of the pine has"
3629,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"so much of this quality, when dry, that it is often used for torches."
3630,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3631,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ I know deal shavings burn very briskly.
3632,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3633,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Yes; and matches are made of bits of deal dipped in brimstone.
3634,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3635,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ True,—and when it was the custom to burn the bodies of the dead,"
3636,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"as you read in Homer and other old authors, the pines and pitch-trees"
3637,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,composed great part of the funeral pile.
3638,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3639,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ But what are pitch-trees? Does pitch grow upon trees?
3640,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3641,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ I was going on to tell you about that. _Tar_ is a product of the
3642,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"trees of this kind, especially of one species, called the pitch-pine."
3643,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"The wood is burnt in a sort of oven made in the earth, and the resinous"
3644,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"juice sweats out, and acquires a peculiar taste and a black colour from"
3645,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,the fire. This is tar. Tar when boiled down to dryness becomes _pitch_.
3646,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3647,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Tar and pitch are chiefly used about ships; are they not?
3648,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3649,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Tut._ They resist moisture, and therefore are of great service in"
3650,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,preventing things from decaying that are exposed to wet. For this

3652,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,and the sides of ships are covered with pitch mixed with other
3653,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"ingredients. Their seams, too, or the places where the planks join, are"
3654,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"filled with tow dipped in a composition of resin, tallow, and pitch, to"

3656,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and other purposes of the like nature, is often tarred over. Cisterns"
3657,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,and casks are pitched to prevent leaking.
3658,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3659,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ But what are sheep tarred for after they are sheared?
3660,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3661,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ To cure wounds and sores in their skin. For the like purposes an
3662,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,ointment made with tar is often rubbed upon children’s heads. Several
3663,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,parts of the pine are medicinal. The tops and green cones of the
3664,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"spruce-fir are fermented with treacle, and the liquor, called"
3665,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_spruce-beer_, is much drunk in America, particularly for the scurvy."
3666,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3667,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Geo._ Is it pleasant?
3668,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3669,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Not to those who are unaccustomed to it. Well—I have now finished
3670,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"my lesson, so let us walk."
3671,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3672,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Har._ Shall we go through the grounds?
3673,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3674,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Tut._ Yes; and then we will view some of the different kinds of fir and
3675,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"pine more closely, and I will show you the difference of their leaves"
3676,ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—A DIALOGUE.,"and cones, by which they are distinguished."

3682,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3683,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3684,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,Little Sally Meanwell had one day been to pay an afternoon’s visit to
3685,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"Miss Harriet, the daughter of Sir Thomas Pemberton. The evening proving"
3686,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"rainy, she was sent home in Sir Thomas’s coach; and on her return, the"
3687,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,following conversation passed between her and her mother:—
3688,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3689,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. Meanwell._ Well, my dear, I hope you have had a pleasant visit?"
3690,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3691,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ O yes, mamma, very pleasant; you cannot think how many fine"
3692,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,things I have seen. And then it is so charming to ride in a coach!
3693,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3694,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ I suppose Miss Harriet showed you all her playthings?
3695,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3696,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ O yes, such fine large dolls, so smartly dressed as I never saw"
3697,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"in my life before. Then she has a baby-house, and all sorts of furniture"
3698,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"in it; and a grotto all made of shells, and shining stones. And then she"
3699,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,showed me all her fine clothes for the next ball; there’s a white slip
3700,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"all full of spangles, and pink ribands; you can’t think how beautiful it"
3701,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,looks!
3702,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3703,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ And what did you admire most of all these fine things?
3704,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3705,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ I don’t know—I admired them all; and I think I liked riding in
3706,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,the coach better than all the rest. Why don’t we keep a coach; and why
3707,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,have I not such fine clothes and playthings as Miss Harriet?
3708,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3709,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Because we cannot afford it, my dear. Your papa is not so rich"
3710,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"by a great deal, as Sir Thomas; and if we were to lay out our money upon"
3711,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"such things, we should not be able to procure food and raiment and other"
3712,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,necessaries for you all.
3713,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3714,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ But why is not papa as rich as Sir Thomas?
3715,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3716,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ Sir Thomas had a large estate left him by his father; but your
3717,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,papa has little but what he gains by his own industry.
3718,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3719,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ But why should not papa be as rich as anybody else? I am sure
3720,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,he deserves it as well.
3721,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3722,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ Do you not think that there are a great many people poorer
3723,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"than he, that are also very deserving?"
3724,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3725,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ Are there?
3726,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3727,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Yes, to be sure. Don’t you know what a number of poor people"
3728,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"there are all around us, who have few of the comforts we enjoy? What do"
3729,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,you think of Ploughman the labourer? I believe you never saw him idle in
3730,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,your life.
3731,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3732,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ No; he is gone to work long before I am up, and he does not"
3733,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"return till almost bedtime, unless it be for his dinner."
3734,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3735,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ Well! how do you think his wife and children live? should you
3736,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,like that we should change places with them?
3737,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3738,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ O, no! they are so dirty and ragged."
3739,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3740,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ They are, indeed, poor creatures; but I am afraid they suffer"
3741,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,worse evils than that.
3742,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3743,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ What mamma?
3744,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3745,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ Why I am afraid they often do not get as much victuals as they
3746,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,could eat. And then in winter they must be half frozen for want of fire
3747,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,and warm clothing. How do you think you could bear all this?
3748,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3749,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ Indeed, I don’t know. But I have seen Ploughman’s wife carry"
3750,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,great brown loaves into the house; and I remember once eating some brown
3751,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"bread and milk, and I thought it very good."
3752,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3753,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ I believe you would not much like it constantly; besides, they"
3754,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,can hardly get enough of that. But you seem to know almost as little of
3755,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,the poor as the young French princess did.
3756,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3757,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ What was that, mamma?"
3758,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3759,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Why, there had been one year so bad a harvest in France that"
3760,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,numbers of the poor were famished to death. This calamity was so much
3761,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"talked of, that it reached the court, and was mentioned before the young"
3762,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"princesses. “Dear me!” said one of them, “how _silly_ that was! Why,"
3763,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"rather than be famished, I would eat bread and cheese.” Her governess"
3764,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,was then obliged to acquaint her that the greatest part of her father’s
3765,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,subjects scarcely ever eat anything better than black bread all their
3766,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,lives; and that vast numbers would now think themselves very happy to
3767,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,get only half their usual pittance of that. Such wretchedness as this
3768,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,was what the princess had not the least idea of; and the account shocked
3769,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"her so much, that she was glad to sacrifice all her finery to afford"
3770,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,some relief to the sufferings of the poor.
3771,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3772,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ But I hope there is nobody famished in our country.
3773,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3774,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ I hope not, for we have laws by which every person is entitled"
3775,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"to relief from the parish, if he is unable to gain a subsistence; and"
3776,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"were there no laws about it, I am sure it would be our duty to part with"
3777,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"every superfluity, rather than let a fellow-creature perish for want of"
3778,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,necessaries.
3779,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3780,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ Then do you think it was wrong for Miss Pemberton to have all
3781,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,those fine things?
3782,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3783,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ No, my dear, if they are suitable to her fortune, and do not"
3784,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,consume the money which ought to be employed in more useful things to
3785,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,herself and others.
3786,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3787,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ But why might she not be contented with such things as I have;
3788,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,and give the money that the rest cost to the poor?
3789,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3790,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Because she can afford both to be charitable to the poor, and"
3791,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,also to indulge herself in these pleasures. But do you recollect that
3792,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"the children of Mr. White the baker, and Mr. Shape the tailor, might"
3793,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,just ask the same questions about you?
3794,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3795,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Sally._ How so?
3796,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3797,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Are not you as much better dressed, and as much more"
3798,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"plentifully supplied with playthings than they are, as Miss Harriet is"
3799,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,than you?
3800,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3801,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ Why, I believe I may, for I remember Polly White was very glad"
3802,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"of one of my old dolls; and Nancy Shape cried for such a sash as mine,"
3803,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,but her mother would not let her have one.
3804,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3805,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Then you see, my dear, that there are many who have fewer"
3806,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,things to be thankful for than _you_ have; and you may also learn what
3807,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"ought to be the true measure of the expectations of children, and the"
3808,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,indulgences of parents.
3809,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3810,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ I don’t quite understand you, mamma."
3811,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3812,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ Everything ought to be suited to the station in which we live
3813,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"or are likely to live, and the wants and duties of it. Your papa and I"
3814,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent
3815,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,pleasure of our children: but it would be very wrong in us to lay out so
3816,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,much on this account as would oblige us to spare in more necessary
3817,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"articles; as in their education, and the common household expenses"
3818,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"required in our way of living. Besides, it would be so far from making"
3819,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"you happier, that it would be doing you the greatest injury."
3820,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3821,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ How could that be, mamma?"
3822,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3823,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ If you were now to be dressed like Miss Pemberton, don’t you"
3824,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,think you would be greatly mortified at being worse dressed when you
3825,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,came to be a young woman?
3826,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3827,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ I believe I should, mamma; for then perhaps I might go to"
3828,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,assemblies; and to be sure I should like to be as smart then as at any
3829,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,time.
3830,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3831,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Well, but it would be still more improper for us to dress you"
3832,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"then beyond our circumstances, because your necessary clothes will then"
3833,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"cost more, you know. Then, if we were now to hire a coach or chair for"
3834,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"you to go visiting in, should you like to leave it off ever afterward?"
3835,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,But you have no reason to expect that you will be able to have those
3836,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,indulgences when you are a woman. And so it is in everything else. The
3837,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"more fine things, and the more gratifications you have now, the more you"
3838,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"will require hereafter: for custom makes things so familiar to us, that"
3839,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,while we enjoy them less we want them more.
3840,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3841,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ How is that, mamma?"
3842,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3843,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Why, don’t you think you have enjoyed your ride in the coach"
3844,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,this evening more than Miss Harriet should have done?
3845,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3846,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ I suppose I have; because if Miss Harriet liked it so well, she"
3847,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"would be always riding, for I know she might have the coach whenever she"
3848,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,pleased.
3849,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3850,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,_Mrs. M._ But if you were both told that you were never to ride in a
3851,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"coach again, which would think it the greater hardship? You could walk,"
3852,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"you know, as you have always done before; but she would rather stay at"
3853,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"home, I believe, than expose herself to the cold wind, and trudge"
3854,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,through the wet and dirt in pattens.
3855,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3856,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Sally._ I believe so, too; and now, mamma, I see that all you have told"
3857,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,me is very right.
3858,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,
3859,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"_Mrs. M._ Well, my dear, let it dwell upon your mind, so as to make you"
3860,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,"cheerful and contented in your station, which you see is so much happier"
3861,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,than that of many and many other children. So now we will talk no more
3862,ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—A DIALOGUE.,on the subject.

3881,THE ROOKERY.,
3882,THE ROOKERY.,"_Francis._ Is that a rookery, papa?"
3883,THE ROOKERY.,
3884,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. Stangrove._ It is. Do you hear what a cawing the birds make?
3885,THE ROOKERY.,
3886,THE ROOKERY.,"_Fr._ Yes; and I see them hopping about among the boughs. Pray, are not"
3887,THE ROOKERY.,rooks the same with crows?
3888,THE ROOKERY.,
3889,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ They are a species of crow; but they differ from the carrion
3890,THE ROOKERY.,"crow and raven in not living upon dead flesh, but upon corn and other"
3891,THE ROOKERY.,"seeds, and grass. They indeed pick up beetles and other insects and"
3892,THE ROOKERY.,"worms. See what a number of them have lighted on yonder ploughed field,"
3893,THE ROOKERY.,almost blackening it over.
3894,THE ROOKERY.,
3895,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ What are they doing?
3896,THE ROOKERY.,
3897,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ Searching for grubs and worms. You see the men in the field do
3898,THE ROOKERY.,"not molest them, for they do a great deal of service by destroying"
3899,THE ROOKERY.,"grubs, which, if they were suffered to grow to winged insects, would do"
3900,THE ROOKERY.,much mischief to the trees and plants.
3901,THE ROOKERY.,
3902,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ But do they hurt the corn?
3903,THE ROOKERY.,
3904,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ Yes, they tear up a good deal of green corn, if they are not"
3905,THE ROOKERY.,"driven away. But upon the whole, rooks are reckoned the farmers’"
3906,THE ROOKERY.,friends; and they do not choose to have them destroyed.
3907,THE ROOKERY.,
3908,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ Do all rooks live in rookeries?
3909,THE ROOKERY.,
3910,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ It is the general nature of them to associate together, and"
3911,THE ROOKERY.,build in numbers on the same or adjoining trees. But this is often in
3912,THE ROOKERY.,"the midst of woods or natural groves. However, they have no objections"
3913,THE ROOKERY.,"to the neighbourhood of man, but readily take to a plantation of tall"
3914,THE ROOKERY.,"trees, though it be close to a house; and this is commonly called a"
3915,THE ROOKERY.,rookery. They will even fix their habitations on trees in the midst of
3916,THE ROOKERY.,towns; and I have seen a rookery in a churchyard in one of the closest
3917,THE ROOKERY.,parts of London.
3918,THE ROOKERY.,
3919,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ I think a rookery is a sort of town itself.
3920,THE ROOKERY.,
3921,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ It is: a village in the air, peopled with numerous"
3922,THE ROOKERY.,inhabitants; and nothing can be more amusing than to view them all in
3923,THE ROOKERY.,"motion, flying to and fro, and busied in their several occupations. The"
3924,THE ROOKERY.,spring is their busiest time. Early in the year they begin to repair
3925,THE ROOKERY.,their nests or build new ones.
3926,THE ROOKERY.,
3927,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ Do they all work together or every one for itself?
3928,THE ROOKERY.,
3929,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ Each pair, after they have coupled, build their own nest; and"
3930,THE ROOKERY.,"instead of helping, they are very apt to steal the materials from one"
3931,THE ROOKERY.,"another. If both birds go out at once in search of sticks, they often"
3932,THE ROOKERY.,"find at their return, the work all destroyed, and the materials carried"
3933,THE ROOKERY.,"off; so that one of them generally stays at home to keep watch. However,"
3934,THE ROOKERY.,I have met with a story which shows that they are not without some sense
3935,THE ROOKERY.,of the criminality of thieving. There was in a rookery a lazy pair of
3936,THE ROOKERY.,"rooks, who never went out to get sticks for themselves, but made a"
3937,THE ROOKERY.,"practice of watching when their neighbours were abroad, and helped"
3938,THE ROOKERY.,themselves from their nests. They had served most of the community in
3939,THE ROOKERY.,this manner and by these means had just finished their own nest; when
3940,THE ROOKERY.,"all the other rooks in a rage, fell upon them at once, pulled their nest"
3941,THE ROOKERY.,"in pieces, beat them soundly, and drove them from their society."
3942,THE ROOKERY.,
3943,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ That was very right—I should have liked to have seen it. But why
3944,THE ROOKERY.,do they live together if they do not help one another?
3945,THE ROOKERY.,
3946,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ They probably receive pleasure from the company of their own
3947,THE ROOKERY.,"kind, as men and various other creatures do. Then, though they do not"
3948,THE ROOKERY.,"assist one another in building, they are mutually serviceable in many"
3949,THE ROOKERY.,ways. If a large bird of prey hovers about a rookery for the purpose of
3950,THE ROOKERY.,"carrying off any of the young ones, they all unite to drive him away."
3951,THE ROOKERY.,"When they are feeding in a flock, several are placed as sentinels upon"
3952,THE ROOKERY.,"the trees all round, who give the alarm if any danger approaches. They"
3953,THE ROOKERY.,often go a long way from home to feed; but every evening the whole flock
3954,THE ROOKERY.,"returns, making a loud cawing as they fly, as if to direct and call in"
3955,THE ROOKERY.,the stragglers. The older rooks take the lead: you may distinguish them
3956,THE ROOKERY.,"by the whiteness of their bills, occasioned by their frequent digging in"
3957,THE ROOKERY.,"the ground, by which the black feathers at the root of the bill are worn"
3958,THE ROOKERY.,off.
3959,THE ROOKERY.,
3960,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ Do rooks always keep to the same trees?
3961,THE ROOKERY.,
3962,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ Yes; they are much attached to them, and when the trees happen"
3963,THE ROOKERY.,"to be cut down, they seem greatly distressed, and keep hovering about"
3964,THE ROOKERY.,"them as they are falling, and will scarcely desert them when they lie on"
3965,THE ROOKERY.,the ground.
3966,THE ROOKERY.,
3967,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ Poor things! I suppose they feel as we should if our town was
3968,THE ROOKERY.,burnt down or overthrown by an earthquake.
3969,THE ROOKERY.,
3970,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ No doubt. The societies of animals greatly resemble those of
3971,THE ROOKERY.,"men; and that of rooks is like those of men in a savage state, such as"
3972,THE ROOKERY.,the communities of the North American Indians. It is a sort of league
3973,THE ROOKERY.,"for mutual aid and defence, but in which every one is left to do as he"
3974,THE ROOKERY.,"pleases, without any obligation to employ himself for the whole body."
3975,THE ROOKERY.,Others unite in a manner resembling more civilized societies of men.
3976,THE ROOKERY.,This is the case with the beavers. They perform great public works by
3977,THE ROOKERY.,"the united efforts of the whole community, such as damming up streams,"
3978,THE ROOKERY.,and constructing mounds for their habitations. As these are works of
3979,THE ROOKERY.,"great art and labour, some of them must probably act under the direction"
3980,THE ROOKERY.,"of others, and be compelled to work whether they will or not. Many"
3981,THE ROOKERY.,curious stories are told to this purpose by those who have observed them
3982,THE ROOKERY.,"in their remotest haunts, where they exercise their full sagacity."
3983,THE ROOKERY.,
3984,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ But are they all true?
3985,THE ROOKERY.,
3986,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ That is more than I can answer for; yet what we certainly know
3987,THE ROOKERY.,of the economy of bees may justify us in believing extraordinary things
3988,THE ROOKERY.,of the sagacity of animals. The society of bees goes farther than that
3989,THE ROOKERY.,"of beavers, and, in some respects, beyond most among men themselves."
3990,THE ROOKERY.,"They not only inhabit a common dwelling, and perform great works in"
3991,THE ROOKERY.,"common, but they lay up a store of provision, which is the property of"
3992,THE ROOKERY.,"the whole community, and is not used except at certain seasons, and"
3993,THE ROOKERY.,"under certain regulations. A beehive is a true image of a commonwealth,"
3994,THE ROOKERY.,"where no member acts for himself alone, but for the whole body."
3995,THE ROOKERY.,
3996,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ But there are drones among them who do not work at all.
3997,THE ROOKERY.,
3998,THE ROOKERY.,_Mr. St._ Yes; and at the approach of winter they are driven out of the
3999,THE ROOKERY.,"hive, and left to perish with cold and hunger. But I have not leisure at"
4000,THE ROOKERY.,present to tell you more about bees. You shall one day see them at work
4001,THE ROOKERY.,"in a glass hive. In the meantime, remember one thing, which applies to"
4002,THE ROOKERY.,all the societies of animals; and I wish it did as well to all those of
4003,THE ROOKERY.,men likewise.
4004,THE ROOKERY.,
4005,THE ROOKERY.,_Fr._ What is that?
4006,THE ROOKERY.,
4007,THE ROOKERY.,"_Mr. St._ The principle upon which they all associate, is to obtain some"
4008,THE ROOKERY.,"benefit for the _whole body_, not to give particular advantages to a"
4009,THE ROOKERY.,few.
4010,THE ROOKERY.,
4011,THE ROOKERY.,

4014,THE SHIP.,THE SHIP.
4015,THE SHIP.,
4016,THE SHIP.,
4017,THE SHIP.,"Charles Osborn, when at home in the holydays, had a visit from a"
4018,THE SHIP.,schoolfellow who was just entered as a midshipman on board of a
4019,THE SHIP.,"man-of-war. _Tom Hardy_ (that was his name) was a free-hearted, spirited"
4020,THE SHIP.,"lad, and a favourite among his companions; but he never liked his book,"
4021,THE SHIP.,and had left school ignorant of almost everything he came there to
4022,THE SHIP.,"learn. What was worse, he had got a contempt for learning of all kinds,"
4023,THE SHIP.,"and was fond of showing it. “What does your father mean,” says he, to"
4024,THE SHIP.,"Charles, “to keep you moping and studying over things of no use in the"
4025,THE SHIP.,world but to plague folks?—Why can’t you go into his majesty’s service
4026,THE SHIP.,"like me, and be made a gentleman of? You are old enough, and I know you"
4027,THE SHIP.,are a lad of spirit.” This kind of talk made some impression upon young
4028,THE SHIP.,"_Osborn_. He became less attentive to the lessons his father set him,"
4029,THE SHIP.,and less willing to enter into instructive conversation. This change
4030,THE SHIP.,"gave his father much concern; but as he knew the cause, he thought it"
4031,THE SHIP.,"best, instead of employing direct authority, to attempt to give a new"
4032,THE SHIP.,"impression to his son’s mind, which might counteract the effect of his"
4033,THE SHIP.,companion’s suggestions.
4034,THE SHIP.,
4035,THE SHIP.,"Being acquainted with an East India captain, who was on the point of"
4036,THE SHIP.,"sailing, he went with his son to pay him a farewell visit on board his"
4037,THE SHIP.,"ship. They were shown all about the vessel, and viewed all the"
4038,THE SHIP.,preparations for so long a voyage. They saw her weigh anchor and unfurl
4039,THE SHIP.,her sails; and they took leave of their friend amid the shouts of the
4040,THE SHIP.,seamen and all the bustle of departure.
4041,THE SHIP.,
4042,THE SHIP.,"Charles was highly delighted with this scene, and as they were returning"
4043,THE SHIP.,"could think and talk of nothing else. It was easy, therefore, for his"
4044,THE SHIP.,father to lead him into the following train of discourse:—
4045,THE SHIP.,
4046,THE SHIP.,After Charles had been warmly expressing his admiration of the grand
4047,THE SHIP.,"sight of a large ship completely fitted out and getting under sail, “I"
4048,THE SHIP.,"do not wonder,” said his father, “that you are so much struck with it;"
4049,THE SHIP.,"it is, in reality, one of the finest spectacles created by human skill,"
4050,THE SHIP.,and the noblest triumph of art over untaught nature. Near two thousand
4051,THE SHIP.,"years ago, when Julius Cesar came over to this island, he found the"
4052,THE SHIP.,"natives in possession of no other kind of vessel than a sort of canoe,"
4053,THE SHIP.,"formed of wickerwork covered with hides, no bigger than a man or two"
4054,THE SHIP.,could carry. But the largest ship in Cesar’s fleet was not more superior
4055,THE SHIP.,"to these, than the Indiaman you have been seeing is to what that was."
4056,THE SHIP.,Our savage ancestors ventured only to paddle along the rivers and
4057,THE SHIP.,"coasts, or cross small arms of the sea in calm weather; and Cesar"
4058,THE SHIP.,himself would have been alarmed to be a few days out of sight of land.
4059,THE SHIP.,But the ship we have just left is going by itself to the opposite side
4060,THE SHIP.,"of the globe, prepared to encounter the tempestuous winds and"
4061,THE SHIP.,"mountainous waves of the vast Southern ocean, and to find its way to its"
4062,THE SHIP.,"destined port, though many weeks must pass with nothing in view but sea"
4063,THE SHIP.,and sky. Now what do you think can be the cause of this prodigious
4064,THE SHIP.,difference in the powers of man at one period and another?”
4065,THE SHIP.,
4066,THE SHIP.,Charles was silent.
4067,THE SHIP.,
4068,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Is it not that there is a great deal more knowledge in one than in
4069,THE SHIP.,the other?
4070,THE SHIP.,
4071,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ To be sure it is.
4072,THE SHIP.,
4073,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Would it not, think you, be as impossible for any number of men"
4074,THE SHIP.,"untaught, by their utmost efforts, to build and navigate such a ship as"
4075,THE SHIP.,"we have seen, as to fly through the air?"
4076,THE SHIP.,
4077,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ I suppose it would.
4078,THE SHIP.,
4079,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ That we may be the more sensible of this, let us consider how many"
4080,THE SHIP.,arts and professions are necessary for this purpose. Come—you shall
4081,THE SHIP.,"begin to name them, and if you forget any, I will put you in mind. What"
4082,THE SHIP.,is the first?
4083,THE SHIP.,
4084,THE SHIP.,"_Ch._ The ship-carpenter, I think."
4085,THE SHIP.,
4086,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ True—what does he do?
4087,THE SHIP.,
4088,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ He builds the ship.
4089,THE SHIP.,
4090,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ How is that done?
4091,THE SHIP.,
4092,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ By fastening the planks and beams together.
4093,THE SHIP.,
4094,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ But do you suppose he can do this as a common carpenter makes a
4095,THE SHIP.,box or set of shelves?
4096,THE SHIP.,
4097,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ I do not know.
4098,THE SHIP.,
4099,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Do you not think that such a vast bulk requires a good deal of
4100,THE SHIP.,"contrivance to bring it into shape, and fit it for all its purposes?"
4101,THE SHIP.,
4102,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ Yes.
4103,THE SHIP.,
4104,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Some ships, you have heard, sail quicker than others—some bear"
4105,THE SHIP.,storms better—some carry more lading—some draw less water—and so on. You
4106,THE SHIP.,do not suppose all these things are left to chance?
4107,THE SHIP.,
4108,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ No.
4109,THE SHIP.,
4110,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ In order to produce these effects with certainty, it is necessary"
4111,THE SHIP.,"to study proportions very exactly, and to lay down an accurate scale by"
4112,THE SHIP.,mathematical lines and figures after which to build the ship. Much has
4113,THE SHIP.,"been written upon this subject, and nice calculations have been made of"
4114,THE SHIP.,"the resistance a ship meets with in making way through the water, and"
4115,THE SHIP.,the best means of overcoming it; also of the action of the wind on the
4116,THE SHIP.,"sails, and their action in pushing on the ship by means of the masts."
4117,THE SHIP.,All these must be understood by a perfect master of ship-building.
4118,THE SHIP.,
4119,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ But I think I know ship-builders who have never had an education
4120,THE SHIP.,to fit them for understanding these things.
4121,THE SHIP.,
4122,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Very likely; but they have followed by rote the rules laid down by
4123,THE SHIP.,"others; and as they work merely by imitation, they cannot alter or"
4124,THE SHIP.,"improve as occasion may require. Then, though common merchant-ships are"
4125,THE SHIP.,"trusted to such builders, yet, in constructing men-of-war and Indiamen"
4126,THE SHIP.,"persons of science are always employed. The French, however, attend to"
4127,THE SHIP.,"this matter more than we do, and, in consequence, their ships generally"
4128,THE SHIP.,sail better than ours.
4129,THE SHIP.,
4130,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ But need a captain of a ship know all these things?
4131,THE SHIP.,
4132,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ It may not be absolutely necessary; yet occasions may frequently
4133,THE SHIP.,arise in which it would be of great advantage for him to be able to
4134,THE SHIP.,judge and give direction in these matters. But suppose the ship
4135,THE SHIP.,built—what comes next?
4136,THE SHIP.,
4137,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ I think she must be rigged.
4138,THE SHIP.,
4139,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Well—who are employed for this purpose?
4140,THE SHIP.,
4141,THE SHIP.,"_Ch._ Mast-makers, ropemakers, sailmakers, and I know not how many other"
4142,THE SHIP.,people.
4143,THE SHIP.,
4144,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ These are all mechanical trades; and though in carrying them on
4145,THE SHIP.,"much ingenuity has been applied in the invention of machines and tools,"
4146,THE SHIP.,"yet we will not stop to consider them. Suppose her, then, rigged—what"
4147,THE SHIP.,next?
4148,THE SHIP.,
4149,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ She must take in her guns and powder.
4150,THE SHIP.,
4151,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Stop there and reflect how many arts you have now set to work.
4152,THE SHIP.,"Gunpowder is one of the greatest inventions of modern times, and what"
4153,THE SHIP.,has given such a superiority to civilized nations over the barbarous? An
4154,THE SHIP.,"English frigate, surrounded by the canoes of all the savages in the"
4155,THE SHIP.,"world, would easily beat them off by means of her guns; and if Cesar"
4156,THE SHIP.,"were to come again to England with his fleet, a battery of cannon would"
4157,THE SHIP.,"sink all his ships, and set his legions a swimming in the sea. But the"
4158,THE SHIP.,"making of gunpowder, and the casting of cannon, are arts that require an"
4159,THE SHIP.,exact knowledge of the science of _Chymistry_.
4160,THE SHIP.,
4161,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ What is that?
4162,THE SHIP.,
4163,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ It comprehends the knowledge of all the properties of metals and
4164,THE SHIP.,"minerals, salts, sulphur, oils, and gums, and of the action of fire, and"
4165,THE SHIP.,"water, and air upon all substances, and the effects of mixing different"
4166,THE SHIP.,things together. Gunpowder is a mixture of three things only; saltpetre
4167,THE SHIP.,"or nitre, sulphur or brimstone, and charcoal. But who could have thought"
4168,THE SHIP.,such a wonderful effect would have been produced by it?
4169,THE SHIP.,
4170,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ Was it not first discovered by accident?
4171,THE SHIP.,
4172,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Yes; but it was by one who was making chymical experiments, and"
4173,THE SHIP.,many more experiments have been employed to bring it to perfection.
4174,THE SHIP.,
4175,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ But need a captain know how to make gunpowder and cannon?
4176,THE SHIP.,
4177,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ It is not necessary, though it may often be useful to him."
4178,THE SHIP.,"However, it is quite necessary that he should know how to employ them."
4179,THE SHIP.,Now the sciences of gunnery and fortification depend entirely upon
4180,THE SHIP.,mathematical principles; for by these are calculated the direction of a
4181,THE SHIP.,"ball through the air, the distance it would reach to, and the force with"
4182,THE SHIP.,"which it will strike any thing. All engineers, therefore, must be good"
4183,THE SHIP.,mathematicians.
4184,THE SHIP.,
4185,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ But I think have heard of gunners being little better than common
4186,THE SHIP.,men.
4187,THE SHIP.,
4188,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ True—there is a way of doing that business, as well as many"
4189,THE SHIP.,"others, by mere practice: and an uneducated man may acquire skill in"
4190,THE SHIP.,"pointing a cannon, as well as in shooting with a common gun. But this is"
4191,THE SHIP.,"only in ordinary cases, and an abler head is required to direct."
4192,THE SHIP.,"Well—now suppose your ship completely fitted out for sea, and the wind"
4193,THE SHIP.,blowing fair; how will you navigate her?
4194,THE SHIP.,
4195,THE SHIP.,"_Ch._ I would spread the sails, and steer by the rudder."
4196,THE SHIP.,
4197,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ Very well—but how would you find your way to the port you are
4198,THE SHIP.,bound for?
4199,THE SHIP.,
4200,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ That I cannot tell.
4201,THE SHIP.,
4202,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Nor, perhaps, can I make you exactly comprehend it; but I can show"
4203,THE SHIP.,you enough to convince you that it is an affair that requires much
4204,THE SHIP.,"knowledge and early study. In former times, when a vessel left the sight"
4205,THE SHIP.,"of land, it was steered by observation of the sun by day, and the moon"
4206,THE SHIP.,"and stars by night. The sun, you know, rises in the east, and sets in"
4207,THE SHIP.,"the west; and at noon, in these parts of the world, it is exactly south"
4208,THE SHIP.,"of us. These points, therefore, may be found out when the sun shines."
4209,THE SHIP.,"The moon and stars vary: however, their place in the sky may be known by"
4210,THE SHIP.,"exact observation. Then, there is one star that always points to the"
4211,THE SHIP.,"north pole, and is therefore called the pole-star. This was of great use"
4212,THE SHIP.,"in navigation, and the word pole-star is often used by the poets to"
4213,THE SHIP.,signify a sure guide. Do you recollect the description in Homer’s
4214,THE SHIP.,"Odyssey, when Ulysses sails away by himself from the island of"
4215,THE SHIP.,Calypso—how he steers by the stars?
4216,THE SHIP.,
4217,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ I think I remember the lines in Pope’s translation.
4218,THE SHIP.,
4219,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Repeat them, then."
4220,THE SHIP.,
4221,THE SHIP.,_Ch._
4222,THE SHIP.,
4223,THE SHIP.,"“Placed at the helm he sat, and mark’d the skies,"
4224,THE SHIP.,Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes;
4225,THE SHIP.,"There view’d the Pleiades, and the Northern Team,"
4226,THE SHIP.,"And great Orion’s more effulgent beam,"
4227,THE SHIP.,"To which, around the axle of the sky,"
4228,THE SHIP.,The Bear revolving points his golden eye:
4229,THE SHIP.,"Who shines exalted on th’ ethereal plain,"
4230,THE SHIP.,Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.”
4231,THE SHIP.,
4232,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Very well; they are fine lines, indeed! You see, then, how long"
4233,THE SHIP.,ago sailors thought it necessary to study astronomy. But as it
4234,THE SHIP.,"frequently happens, especially in stormy weather, that the stars are not"
4235,THE SHIP.,"to be seen, this method was subject to great uncertainty, which rendered"
4236,THE SHIP.,"it dangerous to undertake distant voyages. At length, near 500 years"
4237,THE SHIP.,"since, a property was discovered in a mineral, called the magnet or"
4238,THE SHIP.,"loadstone, which removed the difficulty. This was, its _polarity_, or"
4239,THE SHIP.,"quality of always pointing to the poles of the earth, that is, due north"
4240,THE SHIP.,and south. This it can communicate to any piece of iron; so that a
4241,THE SHIP.,"needle well rubbed in a particular manner by a loadstone, and then"
4242,THE SHIP.,"balanced upon its centre so as to turn round freely, will always point"
4243,THE SHIP.,"to the north. With an instrument called a mariner’s compass, made of one"
4244,THE SHIP.,"of these needles, and a card marked with all the points—north, south,"
4245,THE SHIP.,"east, west, and the divisions between these, a ship may be steered to"
4246,THE SHIP.,any part of the globe.
4247,THE SHIP.,
4248,THE SHIP.,"_Ch._ It is a very easy matter, then."
4249,THE SHIP.,
4250,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ Not quite so easy, neither. In a long voyage, cross or contrary"
4251,THE SHIP.,"winds blow a ship out of her direct course, so that without nice"
4252,THE SHIP.,"calculations both of the straight track she has gone, and all the"
4253,THE SHIP.,"deviations from it, the sailors would not know where they were, nor to"
4254,THE SHIP.,what point to steer. It is also frequently necessary to take
4255,THE SHIP.,"observations, as they call it; that is, to observe with an instrument"
4256,THE SHIP.,"where the sun’s place in the sky is at noon, by which they can determine"
4257,THE SHIP.,the _latitude_ they are in. Other observations are necessary to
4258,THE SHIP.,"determine their _longitude_. What these mean, I can show you upon the"
4259,THE SHIP.,"globe. It is enough now to say that, by means of both together, they can"
4260,THE SHIP.,"tell the exact spot they are on at any time; and then, by consulting"
4261,THE SHIP.,"their map, and setting their compass, they can steer right to the place"
4262,THE SHIP.,"they want. But all this requires a very exact knowledge of astronomy,"
4263,THE SHIP.,"the use of the globes, mathematics, and arithmetic, which you may"
4264,THE SHIP.,suppose is not to be acquired without much study. A great number of
4265,THE SHIP.,curious instruments have been invented to assist in these operations; so
4266,THE SHIP.,that there is scarcely any matter in which so much art and science have
4267,THE SHIP.,been employed as in navigation; and none but a very learned and
4268,THE SHIP.,civilized nation can excel in it.
4269,THE SHIP.,
4270,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ But how is Tom Hardy to do? for I am pretty sure he does not
4271,THE SHIP.,understand any of these things.
4272,THE SHIP.,
4273,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ He must learn them, if he means to come to anything in his"
4274,THE SHIP.,"profession. He may, indeed, head a pressgang, or command a boat’s crew"
4275,THE SHIP.,"without them; but he will never be fit to take charge of a man-of-war,"
4276,THE SHIP.,or even a merchant-ship.
4277,THE SHIP.,
4278,THE SHIP.,"_Ch._ However, he need not learn Latin and Greek."
4279,THE SHIP.,
4280,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ I cannot say, indeed, that a sailor has occasion for those"
4281,THE SHIP.,languages; but a knowledge of Latin makes it much easier to acquire all
4282,THE SHIP.,modern languages; and I hope you do not think them unnecessary to him.
4283,THE SHIP.,
4284,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ I did not know they were of much importance.
4285,THE SHIP.,
4286,THE SHIP.,_Fa._ No! Do you think that one who may probably visit most countries in
4287,THE SHIP.,"Europe, and their foreign settlements, should be able to converse in no"
4288,THE SHIP.,other language than his own? If the knowledge of languages is not useful
4289,THE SHIP.,"to _him_, I know not to whom it is so. He can hardly do at all without"
4290,THE SHIP.,knowing some; and the more the better.
4291,THE SHIP.,
4292,THE SHIP.,_Ch._ Poor Tom! then I doubt he has not chosen so well as he thinks.
4293,THE SHIP.,
4294,THE SHIP.,"_Fa._ I doubt so, too."
4295,THE SHIP.,
4296,THE SHIP.,"Here ended the conversation. They soon after reached home, and Charles"
4297,THE SHIP.,did not forget to desire his father to show him on the globe what
4298,THE SHIP.,longitude and latitude meant.
4299,THE SHIP.,
4300,THE SHIP.,

4303,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.
4304,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4305,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,

4307,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"stories, and now you never tell us any; and we are all got round the"
4308,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"fire quite ready to hear you. Pray, dear papa, let us have a very pretty"
4309,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,one.
4310,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4311,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Father._ With all my heart—What shall it be?
4312,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4313,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ A bloody murder, papa!"
4314,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4315,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Fa._ A bloody murder! Well then—once upon a time some men dressed all
4316,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,alike....
4317,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4318,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Ch._ With black crapes over their faces?
4319,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4320,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Fa._ No; they had steel caps on.—having crossed a dark heath, wound"
4321,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,cautiously along the skirts of a deep forest....
4322,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4323,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ They were ill-looking fellows, I dare say?"
4324,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4325,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Fa._ I cannot say so; on the contrary, they were as tall, personable"
4326,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,men as most one shall see: leaving on their right hand an old ruined
4327,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,tower on the hill....
4328,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4329,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ At midnight, just as the clock struck twelve; was it not, papa?"
4330,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4331,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Fa._ No, really; it was on a fine balmy summer’s morning;—they moved"
4332,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"forward, one behind another...."
4333,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4334,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ As still as death, creeping along under the hedges?"
4335,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4336,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Fa._ On the contrary—they walked remarkably upright; and so far from
4337,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"endeavouring to be hushed and still, they made a loud noise as they came"
4338,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"along, with several sorts of instruments."
4339,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4340,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ But, papa, they would be found out immediately."
4341,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4342,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Fa._ They did not seem to wish to conceal themselves: on the contrary,"
4343,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"they gloried in what they were about. They moved forward, I say, to a"
4344,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"large plain, where stood a neat pretty village which they set on fire."
4345,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4346,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ Set a village on fire, wicked wretches!"
4347,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4348,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Fa._ And while it was burning they murdered—twenty thousand men.
4349,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4350,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,_Ch._ O fie! papa! You don’t intend I should believe this; I thought all
4351,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"along you were making up a tale, as you often do; but you shall not"
4352,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"catch me this time. What! they lay still, I suppose, and let these"
4353,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,fellows cut their throats?
4354,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,
4355,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Fa._ No, truly, they resisted as long as they could."

4357,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ How should these men kill twenty thousand people, pray?"
4358,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,

4361,THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.,"_Ch._ O, now I have found you out! you mean a BATTLE."

4374,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4375,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4376,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,At the time when fairies and genii possessed the powers which they have
4377,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"now lost, there lived in the country of the Bramins, a man named Indur,"
4378,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"who was distinguished, not only for that gentleness of disposition and"
4379,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"humanity towards all living creatures, which are so much cultivated"
4380,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"among those people, but for an insatiable curiosity respecting the"
4381,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,nature and way of life of all animals. In pursuit of knowledge of this
4382,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"kind he would frequently spend the night among lonely rocks, or in the"
4383,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"midst of thick forests; and there under shelter of a hanging cliff, or"
4384,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"mounted upon a high tree, he would watch the motions and actions of all"
4385,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the animals that seek their prey in the night; and remaining in the same
4386,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"spot till the break of day, he would observe this tribe of creatures"
4387,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"retiring to their dens, and all others coming forth to enjoy the beams"
4388,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of the rising sun. On these occasions, if he saw any opportunity of"
4389,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"exercising his benevolence toward animals in distress, he never failed"
4390,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,to make use of it; and many times rescued the small bird from the
4391,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"pitiless hawk, and the lamb or kid from the gripe of the wolf and lynx."
4392,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"One day as he was sitting on a tree in the forest, a little frolicsome"
4393,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"monkey, in taking a great leap from one bough to another, chanced to"
4394,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"miss its hold, and fell from a great height to the ground. As it lay"
4395,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"there unable to move, Indur espied a large venomous serpent advancing to"
4396,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,make the poor defenceless creature his prey. He immediately descended
4397,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"from his post, and taking the little monkey in his arms, ran with it to"
4398,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the tree, and gently placed it upon a bough. In the meantime, the"
4399,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"enraged serpent pursuing him, overtook him before he could mount the"
4400,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"tree, and bit him in the leg. Presently, the limb began to swell, and"
4401,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the effects of the venom became visible over Indur’s whole frame. He
4402,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"grew faint, sick, and pale; and sinking on the ground was sensible that"
4403,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"his last moments were fast approaching. As thus he lay, he was surprised"
4404,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"to hear a human voice from the tree; and looking up, he beheld, on the"
4405,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bow where he had placed the monkey, a beautiful woman, who thus"
4406,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"addressed him:—“Indur, I am truly grieved that thy kindness to me should"
4407,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"have been the cause of thy destruction. Know that, in the form of the"
4408,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"poor monkey, it was the potent fairy Perizinda to whom thou gavest"
4409,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,succour. Obliged to pass a certain number of days every year under the
4410,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"shape of an animal, I have chosen this form; and though not mortal, I"
4411,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"should have suffered extreme agonies from the bite of the serpent, hadst"
4412,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,thou not so humanely assisted me. It is not in my power to prevent the
4413,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,fatal effect of the poison; but I am able to grant thee any wish thou
4414,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,shalt form respecting the future state of existence to which thou art
4415,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"now hastening. Speak then, before it be too late, and let me show my"
4416,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"gratitude.”—“Great Perizinda!” replied Indur, “since you deign so"
4417,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bounteously to return my service, this is the request that I make; in"
4418,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"all my transmigrations may I retain a rational soul, with the memory of"
4419,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the adventures I have gone through; and when death sets me free from one
4420,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"body, may I instantly animate another in the prime of its powers and"
4421,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"faculties, without passing through the helpless state of infancy.”—“It"
4422,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"is granted,” answered the fairy; and immediately, breaking a small"
4423,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"branch from the tree, and breathing on it, she threw it down to Indur,"
4424,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and bid him hold it fast in his hand. He did so, and presently expired."
4425,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4426,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Instantly, he found himself in a green valley, by the side of a clear"
4427,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"stream, grazing amid a herd of antelopes. He admired his elegant shape,"
4428,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sleek, spotted skin, and polished spiral horns; and drank with delight"
4429,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of the cool rivulet, cropped the juicy herb, and sported with his"
4430,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,companions. Soon an alarm was given of the approach of an enemy; and
4431,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"they all set off with the swiftness of the wind, to the neighbouring"
4432,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"immense plains, where they were presently out of the reach of injury."
4433,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,Indur was highly delighted with the ease and rapidity of his motions;
4434,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and snuffing the keen air of the desert, bounded away, scarcely deigning"
4435,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,to touch the ground with his feet. This way of life went on very
4436,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"pleasantly for some time, till at length the herd was one morning"
4437,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"alarmed with noises of trumpets, drums, and loud shouts on every side."
4438,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"They started, and ran first to the right, then to the left, but were"
4439,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"continually driven back by the surrounding crowd, which now appeared to"
4440,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"be a whole army of hunters, with the king of the country, and all his"
4441,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"nobles, assembled at a solemn chase, after the manner of the Eastern"
4442,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"people. And now the circle began to close, and numbers of affrighted"
4443,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"animals of various kinds thronged together in the centre, keeping as far"
4444,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,as possible from the dangers that approached them from all quarters. The
4445,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,huntsmen were now come near enough to reach their game with their
4446,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,arrows; and the prince and his lords shot at them as they passed and
4447,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"repassed, killing and wounding great numbers. Indur and his surviving"
4448,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"companions, seeing no other means of escape, resolved to make a bold"
4449,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,push toward that part of the ring which was the most weakly guarded; and
4450,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"though many perished in the attempt, yet a few, leaping over the heads"
4451,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of the people, got clear away: Indur was among the number. But while he"
4452,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"was scouring over the plain, rejoicing in his good fortune and conduct,"
4453,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"an enemy swifter than himself overtook him. This was a falcon, who, let"
4454,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"loose by one of the huntsmen, dashed like lightning after the fugitives;"
4455,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and alighting upon the head of Indur, began to tear his eyes with his"
4456,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"beak, and flap his wings over his face. Indur, terrified and blinded,"
4457,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"knew not which way he went; and instead of proceeding straight-forward,"
4458,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"turned round and came again toward the hunters. One of these, riding"
4459,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"full speed with a javelin in his hand, came up to him, and ran the"
4460,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"weapon into his side. He fell down, and with repeated wounds was soon"
4461,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,despatched.
4462,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4463,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"When the struggle of death was over, Indur was equally surprised and"
4464,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"pleased on finding himself soaring high in the air, as one of a flight"
4465,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of wild geese, in their annual migration to breed in the arctic regions."
4466,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,With vast delight he sprung forward on easy wing through the immense
4467,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fields of air, and surveyed beneath him extensive tracts of earth"
4468,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"perpetually varying with plains, mountains, rivers, lakes, and woods. At"
4469,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the approach of night the flock lighted on the ground, and fed on the"
4470,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"green corn or grass; and at daybreak they were again on the wing,"
4471,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"arranged in regular wedge-like body, with an experienced leader at their"
4472,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"head. Thus for many days they continued their journey, passing over"
4473,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"countries inhabited by various nations, till at length they arrived in"
4474,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the remotest part of Lapland, and settled in a wide marshy lake, filled"
4475,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with numerous reedy islands, and surrounded on all sides with dark"
4476,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"forests of pine and birch. Here, in perfect security from man and"
4477,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"hurtful animals, they followed the great business of breeding and"
4478,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"providing for their young, living plentifully upon the insects and"
4479,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,aquatic reptiles that abounded in this sheltered spot. Indur with great
4480,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"pleasure exercised his various powers of swimming, diving, and flying;"
4481,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sailing round the islands, penetrating into every creek and bay, and"
4482,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,visiting the deepest recesses of the woods. He surveyed with
4483,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"astonishment the sun, instead of rising and setting, making a complete"
4484,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"circle in the heavens, and cheering the earth with a perpetual day. Here"
4485,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"he met with innumerable tribes of kindred birds varying in size,"
4486,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"plumage, and voice, but all passing their time in a similar manner, and"
4487,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,furnished with the same powers for providing food and a safe retreat for
4488,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,themselves and their young. The whole lake was covered with parties
4489,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fishing or sporting, and resounded with their loud cries; while the"
4490,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"islands were filled with their nests, and new broods of young were"
4491,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,continually coming forth and launching upon the surface of the waters.
4492,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"One day, Indur’s curiosity having led him at a distance from his"
4493,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"companions to the woody border of the lake, he was near paying dear for"
4494,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"his heedlessness; for a fox, that lay in wait among the bushes, sprung"
4495,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"upon him, and it was with the utmost difficulty that by a strong"
4496,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"exertion he broke from his hold, not without the loss of some feathers."
4497,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4498,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Summer now drawing to an end, the vast congregation of water-fowl begun"
4499,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"to break up; and large bodies of them daily took their way southward, to"
4500,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,pass the winter in climates where the waters are never so frozen as to
4501,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"become uninhabitable by the feathered race. The wild geese, to whom"
4502,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur belonged, proceeded with their young ones, by long daily journeys"
4503,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"across Sweden, the Baltic sea, Poland and Turkey, to Lesser Asia, and"
4504,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,finished their journey at the celebrated plains on the banks of the
4505,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Cayster, a noted resort for their species ever since the age of Homer,"
4506,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,who in some very beautiful verses has described the manners and actions
4507,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,of the various tribes of aquatic birds in that favourite spot.[1] Here
4508,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"they soon recruited from the fatigue of their march, and enjoyed"
4509,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"themselves in the delicious climate till winter. This season, though"
4510,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"here extremely mild, yet making the means of sustenance somewhat scarce,"
4511,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,they were obliged to make foraging excursions to the cultivated lands in
4512,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the neighbourhood. Having committed great depredations upon a fine field
4513,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of young wheat, the owner spread a net on the ground, in which Indur,"
4514,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with several of his companions, had the misfortune to be caught. No"
4515,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"mercy was shown them, but as they were taken out one by one, their necks"
4516,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,were all broken.

4526,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4527,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur was not immediately sensible of the next change he underwent,"
4528,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which was into a dormouse, fast asleep into a hole at the foot of a"
4529,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bush. As it was in a country where the winter was pretty severe, he did"
4530,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"not awake for some weeks; when a thaw having taken place, and the sun"
4531,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"beginning to warm the earth, he unrolled himself one day, stretched,"
4532,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"opened his eyes, and not being able to make out where he was, he roused"
4533,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,a female companion whom he found by his side. When she was sufficiently
4534,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"awakened, and they both began to feel hungry, she led the way to a"
4535,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"magazine of nuts and acorns, where they made a comfortable meal, and"
4536,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"soon fell asleep again. This nap having lasted a few days, they awaked a"
4537,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"second time, and having eaten, they ventured to crawl to the mouth of"
4538,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"their hole, where, pulling away some withered grass and leaves, they"
4539,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"peeped out into the open air. After taking a turn or two in the sun,"
4540,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"they grew chill, and went down again, stopping up the entrance after"
4541,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"them. The cold weather returning, they took another long nap, till, at"
4542,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"length, spring being fairly set in, they roused in earnest, and began to"
4543,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,make daily excursions abroad. Their winter-stock of provisions being now
4544,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"exhausted, they were for some time reduced to great straits, and obliged"
4545,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,to dig for roots and pig-nuts. Their fare was mended as the season
4546,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"advanced, and they made a nest near the bottom of a tree, where they"
4547,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"brought up a young family. They never ranged far from home, nor ascended"
4548,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the higher branches of the tree, and passed great part of their time in"
4549,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sleep, even during the midst of summer. When autumn came, they were"
4550,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"busily employed in collecting the nuts, acorns, and other dry fruits"
4551,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"that fell from the trees, and laying them up in their storehouses"
4552,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"underground. One day, as Indur was thus closely engaged at some distance"
4553,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"from his dwelling, he was seized by a wildcat, who, after tormenting him"
4554,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"for a time, gave him a gripe, and put him out of his pain."
4555,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4556,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"From one of the smallest and most defenceless of animals, Indur found"
4557,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"himself instantly changed into a majestic elephant, in a lofty forest in"
4558,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the isle of Ceylon. Elated with this wonderful advancement in the scale
4559,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of creation, he stalked along with conscious dignity, and surveyed with"
4560,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"pleasing wonder his own form and that of his companions, together with"
4561,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the rich scenery of the ever-verdant woods, which perfumed the air with"
4562,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"their spicy odour, and lifted their tall heads to the clouds. Here,"
4563,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fearing no injury, and not desirous to do any, the gigantic herd roamed"
4564,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"at large, feeding on the green branches which they tore down with their"
4565,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"trunks, and bathing in deep rivers during the heat of the day; and,"
4566,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"reposing in the depths of the forests, reclined against the massy trunks"
4567,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,of trees by night. It was long before Indur met with any adventure that
4568,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"could lead him to doubt his security. But, one day, having penetrated"
4569,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"into a close entangled thicket, he espied, lurking under the thick"
4570,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"covert, a grim tiger, whose eyes flashed rage and fury. Though the tiger"
4571,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"was one of the largest of his species, yet his bulk was trifling"
4572,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"compared with that of an elephant, a single foot of which seemed"
4573,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sufficient to crush him; yet the fierceness and cruelty of his looks,"
4574,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"his angry growl, and grinning teeth, struck some terror into Indur."
4575,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"There was little time, however, for reflection: for when Indur had"
4576,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"advanced a single step, the tiger, setting up a roar, sprung to meet"
4577,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"him, attempting to seize his lifted trunk. Indur was dexterous enough to"
4578,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"receive him upon one of his tusks, and exerting all his strength, threw"
4579,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the tiger to a great distance. He was somewhat stunned by the fall, but"
4580,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"recovering, renewed the assault with redoubled fury. Indur again, and a"
4581,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"third time, threw him off; after which the tiger, turning about, bounded"
4582,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"away into the midst of the thicket. Indur drew back, and rejoined his"
4583,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"companions, with some abatement in the confidence he had placed in his"
4584,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"size and strength, which had not prevented him from undergoing so"
4585,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,dangerous an attack.
4586,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4587,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Soon after, he joined the rest of the herd, in an expedition beyond the"
4588,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bounds of the forest, to make depredations on some fields of maize. They"
4589,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"committed great havoc, devouring part, but tearing up and trampling down"
4590,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"much more; when the inhabitants taking the alarm, assembled in great"
4591,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"numbers, and with fierce shouts and flaming brands drove them back to"
4592,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the woods. Not contented with this, they were resolved to make them pay"
4593,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"for the mischief they had done, by taking some prisoners. For this"
4594,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,purpose they enclosed a large space among the trees with strong posts
4595,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and stakes, bringing it to a narrower and narrower compass, and ending"
4596,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,at last in a passage only capable of admitting one elephant at a time.
4597,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"This was divided into several apartments, by strong cross-bars, which"
4598,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,would lift up and down. They then sent out some tame female elephants
4599,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bred to the business, who approaching the herd of wild ones, inveigled"
4600,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the males to follow them toward the enclosures. Indur was among the
4601,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,first who was decoyed by their artifices; and with some others following
4602,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"heedlessly, he got into the narrowest part of the enclosure, opposite to"
4603,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the passage. Here they stood awhile, doubting whether they should go"
4604,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"farther. But the females leading the way, and uttering their cry of"
4605,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"invitation, they ventured at length to follow. When a sufficient number"
4606,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"was in the passage, the bars were let down by men placed for that"
4607,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"purpose, and the elephants were fairly caught in a trap. As soon as they"
4608,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"were sensible of their situation, they fell into a fit of rage, and with"
4609,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,all their efforts endeavoured to break through. But the hunters throwing
4610,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"nooses over them, bound them fast with strong ropes and chains to the"
4611,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"post on each side, and thus kept them without food or sleep for three"
4612,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"days; when being exhausted with hunger and fatigue, they gave signs of"
4613,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sufficient tameness. They were now let out one by one, and bound each of"
4614,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"them to two large tame elephants with riders on their backs, and thus"
4615,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,without resistance were led away close prisoners. They were then put
4616,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"into separate stables, and by proper discipline, were presently rendered"
4617,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,quite tame and gentle.
4618,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4619,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Not long after, Indur, with five more, was sent over from Ceylon to the"
4620,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"continent of India, and sold to one of the princes of the country. He"
4621,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,was now trained to all the services elephants are there employed in;
4622,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which were, to carry people on his back in a kind of sedan, or litter,"
4623,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"to draw cannon, ships, and other great weights, to kneel and rise at"
4624,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"command, make obeisance to his lord, and perform all the motions and"
4625,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,attitudes he was ordered. Thus he lived a long time well fed and
4626,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"caressed, clothed in costly trappings on days of ceremony, and"
4627,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"contributing to the pomp of Eastern royalty. At length, a war broke out,"
4628,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,and Indur came to be employed in a different scene. After proper
4629,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"training he was marched with a number of his fellows, into the field,"
4630,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"bearing on his back a small wooden tower, in which were placed some"
4631,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"soldiers with a small field-piece. They soon came in sight of the enemy,"
4632,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,and both sides were drawn up for battle. Indur and the rest were urged
4633,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,forward by their leaders wondering at the same time at the scene in
4634,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which they were engaged, so contrary to their nature and manners."
4635,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Presently, all was involved in smoke and fire. The elephants advancing,"
4636,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,soon put to flight those who were drawn up before them; but their career
4637,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"was stopped by a battery of cannon, which played furiously against them."
4638,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Their vast bodies offered a fair mark to the balls, which presently"
4639,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"struck down some, and wounded others. Indur received a shot on one of"
4640,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"his tusks, which broke it, and put him to such pain and affright, that,"
4641,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"turning about, he ran with all speed over the plain; and falling in with"
4642,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"a body of their own infantry, he burst through, trampling down whole"
4643,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"ranks, and filling them with terror and confusion. His leader having now"
4644,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"lost all command over him, and finding him hurtful to his own party,"
4645,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"applied the sharp instrument he carried to the nape of his neck, and"
4646,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"driving it in with all his force, pierced his spinal marrow, so that he"
4647,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,fell lifeless to the ground.
4648,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4649,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"In the next stage of his existence, Indur, to his great surprise, found"
4650,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,even the vast bulk of the elephant prodigiously exceeded; for he was now
4651,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"a whale of the largest species, rolling in the midst of the arctic seas."
4652,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"As he darted along, the lash of his tail made whirlpools in the mighty"
4653,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"deep. When he opened his immense jaws he drew in a flood of brine,"
4654,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which, on rising to the surface, he spouted out again in a rushing"
4655,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fountain, that rose high in the air with the noise of a mighty cataract."
4656,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,All the other inhabitants of the ocean seemed as nothing to him. He
4657,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"swallowed, almost without knowing it, whole shoals of the smaller kinds;"
4658,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and the larger swiftly turned aside at his approach. “Now,” he cried to"
4659,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"himself, “whatever other evils await me, I am certainly secure from the"
4660,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,molestation of other animals; for what is the creature that can dare to
4661,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"cope with me, or measure his strength with mine?” Having said this, he"
4662,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"saw swimming near him a fish not a quarter of his length, armed with a"
4663,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"dreadful row of teeth. This was a grampus, which directly flying upon"
4664,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur, fastened on him, and made his great teeth meet in his flesh."
4665,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur roared with pain, and lashed the sea, till it was all in a foam,"
4666,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,but could neither reach nor shake off his cruel foe. He rolled over and
4667,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"over, rose and sunk, and exerted all his boasted strength; but to no"
4668,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"purpose. At length, the grampus quitted his hold, and left him not a"
4669,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"little mortified with the adventure. This was, however, forgotten, and"
4670,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur received pleasure from his new situation, as he roamed through the"
4671,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"boundless fields of ocean, now diving to its very bottom, now shooting"
4672,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"swiftly to its surface, and sporting with his companions in unwieldly"
4673,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"gambols. Having chosen a mate, he took his course with her southward,"
4674,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and, in due time, brought up two young ones, of whom he was extremely"
4675,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fond. The summer season being arrived, he more frequently than usual"
4676,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"rose to the surface, and basking in the sunbeams, floated unmoved with a"
4677,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,large part of his huge body above the waves. As he was thus one day
4678,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"enjoying a profound sleep, he was awakened by a sharp instrument"
4679,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"penetrating deep into his back. Instantly, he sprung away with the"
4680,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"swiftness of lightning, and feeling the weapon still sticking, he dived"
4681,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"into the recesses of the deep, and stayed there till want of air obliged"
4682,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"him to ascend to the surface. Here another harpoon was plunged into him,"
4683,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the smart of which again made him fly from his unseen foes; but, after a"
4684,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"shorter course, he was again compelled to rise, much weakened by the"
4685,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"loss of blood, which, gushing in a torrent, tinged the waters as he"
4686,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"passed. Another wound was inflicted, which soon brought him almost"
4687,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,lifeless to the surface; and the line fastened to the first harpoon
4688,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"being now pulled in, this enormous creature was brought, an unresisting"
4689,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"prey, to the side of a ship, where he was soon quietly despatched, and"
4690,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,then cut to pieces.
4691,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4692,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"The soul of this huge carcass had next a much narrower lodging, for"
4693,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur was changed into a bee, which, with a great multitude of its young"
4694,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"companions, was on flight in search of a new settlement, their parents"
4695,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"having driven them out of the hive, which was unable to contain them"
4696,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"all. After a rambling excursion, the queen, by whom all their motions"
4697,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"were directed, settled on the branch of a lofty tree. They all"
4698,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"immediately clustered round her, and soon formed a large black bunch,"
4699,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"depending from the bough. A man presently planting a ladder, ascended"
4700,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with a beehive, and swept them in. After they were quietly settled in"
4701,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"their new habitation, they were placed on a stand in the garden along"
4702,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with some other colonies, and left to begin their labours. Every fine"
4703,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"morning, as soon as the sun was up, the greatest part of them sallied"
4704,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"forth, and roamed over the garden and the neighbouring fields in search"
4705,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,of fresh and fragrant flowers. They first collected a quantity of gluey
4706,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"matter, with which they lined all the inside of their house. Then they"
4707,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"brought wax, and began to make their cells, building them with the"
4708,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"utmost regularity, though it was their first attempt, and they had no"
4709,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"teacher. As fast as they were built, some were filled with liquid honey,"
4710,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"gathered from the nectaries of flowers; and as they filled the cells,"
4711,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"they sealed them up with a thin covering of wax. In other cells, the"
4712,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"queen-bee deposited her eggs, which were to supply a new progeny for the"
4713,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,ensuing year. Nothing could be a more pleasing sight than to behold on a
4714,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sunshiny day the insects continually going forth to their labour, while"
4715,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"others were as constantly arriving at the mouth of the hole, either with"
4716,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"yellow balls of wax under their thighs, or full of the honey which they"
4717,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,had drawn in with their trunks for the purpose of spouting it out into
4718,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,the cells of the honeycomb. Indur felt much delight in this useful and
4719,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"active way of life, and was always one of the first abroad at the dawn,"
4720,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,and latest home in the evening. On rainy and foggy days they stayed at
4721,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"home, and employed themselves in finishing their cells, and all the"
4722,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"necessary work within doors; and Indur, though endued with human reason,"
4723,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,could not but admire the readiness with which he and the rest formed the
4724,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"most regular plans of work, all corresponding in design and execution,"
4725,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,guided by instinct alone.
4726,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4727,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"The end of autumn now approaching, the bees had filled their combs with"
4728,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"honey; and nothing more being to be got abroad, they stayed within"
4729,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"doors, passing most of their time in sleep. They ate a little of their"
4730,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"store, but with great frugality; and all their meals were made in"
4731,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"public, none daring to make free with the common stock by himself. The"
4732,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"owner of the hives now came and took them one by one into his hand, that"
4733,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,he might judge by the weight whether or no they were full of honey. That
4734,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"in which Indur was, proved to be one of the heaviest; and it was"
4735,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"therefore resolved to take the contents. For this purpose, one cold"
4736,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"night, when the bees were all fast asleep, the hive was placed over a"
4737,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"hole in the ground, in which were put brimstone matches set on fire. The"
4738,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fumes rose into the hive, and soon suffocated great part of the bees,"
4739,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and stupified the rest, so that they all fell from the combs. Indur was"
4740,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,among the dead.
4741,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4742,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,He soon revived in the form of a young rabbit in a spacious warren. This
4743,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,was like a populous town; being everywhere hollowed by burrows running
4744,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"deep under ground, and each inhabited by one or more families. In the"
4745,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"evening the warren was covered with a vast number of rabbits, old and"
4746,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"young, some feeding, others frisking about, and pursuing one another in"
4747,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"wanton sport. At the least alarm, they all hurried into the holes"
4748,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"nearest them, and were in an instant safe from enemies, who either could"
4749,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"not follow them at all or, if they did, were foiled in the chase by the"
4750,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"numerous ways and turnings in the earth, communicating with each other,"
4751,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,so as to afford easy means of escape. Indur delighted much in this
4752,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"secure and social life; and taking a mate, was soon the father of a"
4753,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"numerous offspring. Several of the little ones, however, not being"
4754,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"sufficiently careful, fell a prey either to hawks and crows, continually"
4755,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"hovering over the warren, or to cats, foxes, and other wild quadrupeds,"
4756,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,who used every art to catch them at a distance from their holes. Indur
4757,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,himself ran several hazards. He was once very near being caught by a
4758,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"little dog trained for the purpose, who kept playing round for a"
4759,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"considerable time, not seeming to attend to the rabbits, till having got"
4760,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"near, he all at once darted into the midst of them. Another time he"
4761,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,received some shot from a sportsman who lay on the watch behind a hedge
4762,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,adjoining the warren.
4763,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4764,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"The number of rabbits here was so great, that a hard winter coming on,"
4765,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which killed most of the vegetables, or buried them deep under the snow,"
4766,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"they were reduced to great straits, and many were famished to death."
4767,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Some turnips and hay, however, which were laid for them, preserved the"
4768,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,greater part. The approach of spring renewed their sport and pleasure;
4769,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and Indur was made the father of another family. One night, however, was"
4770,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"fatal to them all. As they were sleeping, they were alarmed by the"
4771,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,attack of a ferret; and running with great speed to the mouth of their
4772,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"burrow to escape it, they were all caught in nets placed over their"
4773,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"holes. Indur, with the rest, was despatched by a blow on the back of the"
4774,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"neck, and his body was sent to the nearest market-town."
4775,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4776,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"His next change was into a young mastiff, brought up in a farmyard."
4777,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Having nearly acquired his full size, he was sent as a present to a"
4778,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"gentleman in the neighbourhood, who wanted a faithful guard for his"
4779,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,house and grounds. Indur presently attached himself to his master and
4780,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"all his family, and showed every mark of a noble and generous nature."
4781,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,Though fierce as a lion whenever he thought the persons or property of
4782,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"his friends invaded, he was as gentle as a lamb at other times, and"
4783,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,would patiently suffer any kind of freedoms from those he loved. He
4784,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"permitted the children of the house to lug him about, ride on his back,"
4785,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and use him as roughly as their little hands were capable of; never,"
4786,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"even when hurt, showing any displeasure further than by a low growl. He"
4787,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,was extremely indulgent to all the other animals of his species in the
4788,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,yard; and when abroad would treat the impertinent barking of little dogs
4789,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with silent contempt. Once, indeed, being provoked beyond bearing, not"
4790,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"only by the noise, but by the snaps of a malicious whelp, he suddenly"
4791,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,seized him in his open mouth; but when the bystanders thought that the
4792,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"poor cur was going instantly to be destroyed, they were equally diverted"
4793,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"and pleased at seeing Indur go to the side of a muddy ditch, and drop"
4794,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,his antagonist unhurt into the middle of it.
4795,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4796,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"He had, however, more serious conflicts frequently to sustain. He was"
4797,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,accustomed to attend the servant on market-days to the neighbouring
4798,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"town, when it was his office to guard the provision cart, while the man"
4799,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,was making his purchases in the shops. On these occasions the boldest
4800,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,dogs in the street would sometimes make an onset in a body; and while
4801,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"some of them were engaging Indur, others would be mounting the cart, and"
4802,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,pulling down the meat-baskets. Indur had much ado to defend himself and
4803,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"the baggage, too; however, he never failed to make some of the"
4804,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"assailants pay dearly for their impudence; and by his loud barking, he"
4805,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"summoned his human fellow-servant to his assistance, in time to prevent"
4806,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,their depredations.
4807,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4808,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"At length, his courage was exerted on the most important service to"
4809,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"which it could be applied. His master returning home late one evening,"
4810,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,was attacked near his own house by three armed ruffians. Indur heard his
4811,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"voice calling for help, and instantly flew to his relief. He seized one"
4812,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"of the villains by the throat, brought him to the ground, and presently"
4813,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"disabled him. The master, in the meantime, was keeping off the other two"
4814,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"with a large stick, but had received several wounds with a cutlass; and"
4815,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"one of the men had presented a pistol, and was just on the point of"
4816,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"firing. At this moment, Indur, leaving his vanquished foe on the ground,"
4817,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"rushed forward, and seizing the man’s arm, made him drop the pistol. The"
4818,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,master took it up; on which the other robber fled. He now advanced to
4819,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"him with whom Indur was engaged, and fired the pistol at him. The ball"
4820,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"broke the man’s arm, and thence entered the body of Indur, and mortally"
4821,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"wounded him. He fell, but had the satisfaction of seeing his master"
4822,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"remain lord of the field; and the servants now coming up, made prisoners"
4823,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,of the two wounded robbers. The master threw himself by the side of
4824,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur, and expressed the warmest concern at the accident which had made"
4825,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,him the cause of death of the faithful animal that had preserved his
4826,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,life. Indur died licking his hand.
4827,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,
4828,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,So generous a nature was now no longer to be annexed to a brutal form.
4829,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Indur awaking as it were from a trance, found himself again in the happy"
4830,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"region he had formerly inhabited, and recommenced the innocent life of a"
4831,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"Bramin. He cherished the memory of his transmigrations, and handed them"
4832,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,"down to posterity, in a relation from which the preceding account has"
4833,THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.,been extracted for the amusement of our young readers.

4866,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Till all the snow and ice were thawed.”
4867,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“But I,” rejoined the bird,"
4868,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“Who love cold weather just as well as you,"
4869,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Soon as the warning blasts I heard.
4870,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Away I flew,"
4871,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"And mounting in the wind,"
4872,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Left gloomy winter far behind.
4873,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Directed by the mid-day sun,"
4874,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"O’er sea and land my venturous course I steered,"
4875,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Nor was my distant journey done
4876,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Till Afric’s verdant coast appeared.
4877,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"There, all the season long,"
4878,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"I chased gay butterflies and gnats,"
4879,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"And gave my negro friends a morning song,"
4880,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,And housed at night among the bats.
4881,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Then, at the call of spring,"
4882,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"I northward turned my wing,"
4883,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,And here again her joyous message bring.”
4884,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“Lord! what a deal of heedless ranging,”"
4885,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Returned the reptile grave,"
4886,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“For ever hurrying, bustling, changing,"
4887,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,As if it were your life to save!
4888,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Why need you visit foreign nations?
4889,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Rather like me, and some of your relations,"
4890,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"Take out a pleasant half-year’s nap,"
4891,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,Secure from trouble and mishap.”
4892,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“A pleasant nap, indeed!” replied the swallow"
4893,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"“When I can neither see nor fly,"
4894,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,The bright example I may follow
4895,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"‘Till then, in truth, not I!"
4896,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"I measure time by its employment,"
4897,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,And only value life for life’s enjoyment
4898,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"As good be buried all at once,"
4899,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,"As doze out half one’s days, like you, you stupid dunce!”"
4900,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,
4901,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,
4902,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,
4903,THE SWALLOW AND TORTOISE.,
4904,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,THE GRASS-TRIBE.
4905,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4906,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tutor_—_George_—_Harry_.
4907,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4908,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4909,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Harry._ Pray, what is that growing on the other side of the hedge?"
4910,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4911,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_George._ Why it is corn—don’t you see it is in ear.
4912,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4913,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ Yes—but it seems too short for corn; and the corn we just now
4914,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,passed is not in ear by a great deal.
4915,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4916,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Geo._ Then I don’t know what it is. Pray, sir, will you tell us?"
4917,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4918,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ I don’t wonder you were puzzled about it. It is a sort of grass
4919,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"sown for hay, and is called rye-grass."
4920,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4921,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ But how happens it that it is so very like corn?
4922,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4923,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ There is no great wonder in that, for all corn is really a kind"
4924,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"of grass; on the other hand, if you were a Lilliputian, every species of"
4925,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,grass would appear to you amazing large corn.
4926,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4927,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Geo._ Then there is no difference between corn and grass, but the size?"
4928,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4929,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ None at all.
4930,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4931,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ But we eat corn; and grass is not good to eat.
4932,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4933,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ It is only the seeds of corn that we eat: we leave the stalks and
4934,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"leaves for cows and horses. Now we might eat the seeds of grass, if they"
4935,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,were big enough to be worth gathering; and some particular kinds are in
4936,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,fact eaten in certain countries.
4937,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4938,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ But are wheat and barley really grass?
4939,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4940,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Yes—they are a species of that great family of plants, which"
4941,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,botanists call _grasses_; and I will take this opportunity of telling
4942,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"you something about them. Go, George, and pull us up a root of that"
4943,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,rye-grass. Harry and I will sit down on this stile till you come to us?
4944,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4945,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ Here is grass enough all round us.
4946,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4947,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Well, then, pull up a few roots that you see in ear."
4948,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4949,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ Here is my grass.
4950,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4951,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ And here is mine.
4952,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4953,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ Well—spread them all in a handkerchief before us. Now look at the
4954,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,roots of them all. What do you call them?
4955,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4956,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ I think they are what you have told us—_fibrous_ roots.
4957,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4958,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ Right—they consist of a bundle of strings. Then look at their
4959,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"stalks—you will find them jointed and hollow, like the straw of corn."
4960,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4961,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ So they are.
4962,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4963,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ The leaves, you see, of all the kinds are very long and narrow,"
4964,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"tapering to a point at their ends. Those of corn, you know, are the"
4965,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,same.
4966,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4967,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Har._ Yes—they are so like grass at first, that I can never tell the"
4968,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,difference.
4969,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4970,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Next observe the ears, or heads. Some of these, you see, are"
4971,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"thick, and close, like those of wheat or barley; others are more loose"
4972,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"and open, like oats. The first are generally called _spikes_; the second"
4973,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_panicles_. If you examine them closely, you will find that they all"
4974,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"consist of a number of distinct husky bodies, which are properly the"
4975,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,flowers; each of which is succeeded by a single seed. I dare say you
4976,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,have picked ears of wheat?
4977,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4978,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ O yes—I am very fond of them!
4979,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4980,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Well then—you found that the grains all lay single, contained in"
4981,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"a scaly husk making a part of the ear, or head. Before the seed was"
4982,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"formed, there was a flower in its place. I do not mean a gay"
4983,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"fine-coloured flower, but a few scales with threads coming out among"
4984,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"them, each crowned with a white tip. And soon after the ears of corn"
4985,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"appear you will find their flowers open, and these white tips coming out"
4986,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,of them. This is the structure of the flowers and flowering heads of
4987,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,every one of the grass tribe.
4988,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4989,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ But what are the _beards_ of corn?
4990,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4991,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ The beards are bristles or points running out from the ends of
4992,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,the husks. They are properly called _awns_. Most of the grass-tribe have
4993,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"something of these, but they are much longer in some kinds than in"
4994,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"others. In barley, you know, they are very long, and give the whole"
4995,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"field a sort of downy or silky appearance, especially when waved by the"
4996,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,wind.
4997,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
4998,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ Are there the same kinds of corn and grass in all countries?
4999,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5000,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ No. With respect to corn, that is in all countries the product of"
5001,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,cultivation; and different sorts are found best to suit different
5002,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"climates. Thus, in the northern parts of the temperate zone, oats and"
5003,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"rye are chiefly grown. In the middle and southern, barley and wheat."
5004,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,Wheat is universally the species preferred for bread-corn; but there are
5005,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"various kinds of it, differing from each other in size of grain, colour,"
5006,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,and other qualities
5007,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5008,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ Does not the best wheat of all grow in England?
5009,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5010,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ By no means. Wheat is better suited to the warmer climates, and"
5011,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,it is only by great attention and upon particular soils that it is made
5012,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"to succeed well here. On the other hand, the torrid zone is too hot for"
5013,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"wheat and our other grains; and they chiefly cultivate rice there, and"
5014,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,Indian corn.
5015,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5016,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Geo._ I have seen heads of Indian corn as thick as my wrist, but they"
5017,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,do not look at all like our corn.
5018,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5019,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ Yes—the seeds all grow single in a sort of chaffy head; and the
5020,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"stalk and leaves resemble those of the grass-tribe, but of a gigantic"
5021,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"size. But there are other plants of this family, which perhaps you have"
5022,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,not thought of.
5023,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5024,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ What are they?
5025,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5026,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Canes and reeds—from the sugarcanes and bamboo of the tropics, to"
5027,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"the common reed of our ditches, of which you make arrows. All these have"
5028,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,the general character of the grasses.
5029,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5030,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Har._ I know that reeds have very fine feathery heads, like the tops of"
5031,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,grass.
5032,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5033,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ They have so. And the stalks are composed of many joints; as are
5034,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"also those of the sugarcane, and of the common cane which grows in the"
5035,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"southern countries of Europe, and of which fishing-rods are often made,"
5036,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"as well as of the bamboo imported hither for walking-sticks, and applied"
5037,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,to many more important uses in the countries of which it is a native.
5038,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"Some of these are very tall plants, but the seeds of them are small in"
5039,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"proportion, and not useful for food. But there is yet another kind of"
5040,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,grasslike plants common among us.
5041,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5042,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ What is that?
5043,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5044,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Have you not observed in the marshes, and on the sides of"
5045,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"ditches, a coarse broader-leaved sort of grass with large dark-coloured"
5046,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"spikes? This is _sedge_, in Latin _carex_, and there are many sorts of"
5047,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,it.
5048,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5049,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ What is that good for?
5050,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5051,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ It is eaten by cattle, both fresh and dry, but is inferior in"
5052,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,quality to good grass.
5053,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5054,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ What is it that makes one kind of grass better than another?
5055,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5056,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ There are various properties which give value to grasses. Some
5057,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"spread more than others, resist frost and drought better; yield a"
5058,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"greater crop of leaves, and are therefore better for pasturage and hay."
5059,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,The juices of some are more nourishing and sweet than those of others.
5060,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"In general, however, different grasses are suited to different soils;"
5061,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"and by improving soils, the quality of the grass is improved."
5062,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5063,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ Does grass grow in all countries?
5064,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5065,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Yes—the green turf, which naturally covers fertile soils of all"
5066,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"countries, is chiefly composed of grasses of various kinds. They form,"
5067,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"therefore, the verdant carpet extended over the earth; and humble as"
5068,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"they are, contribute more to beauty and utility, than any other part of"
5069,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,the vegetable creation.
5070,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5071,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ What—more than trees?
5072,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5073,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ Yes, certainly. A land entirely covered with trees would be"
5074,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"gloomy, unwholesome, and scarcely inhabitable; whereas, the meadow, the"
5075,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"down, and the cornfield, afford the most agreeable prospects to the eye,"
5076,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"and furnish every necessary, and many of the luxuries of life. Give us"
5077,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"corn and grass, and what shall we want for food?"
5078,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5079,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Har._ Let me see—what should we have? There’s bread and flour for
5080,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,puddings.
5081,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5082,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Geo._ Ay, and milk, for you know cows live on grass and hay—so there’s"
5083,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,cheese and butter and all things that are made of milk.
5084,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5085,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"_Tut._ And are there not all kinds of meat too, and poultry? And then"
5086,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"for drink, there are beer and ale, which are made from barley. For all"
5087,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,these we are chiefly indebted to _the grasses_.
5088,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5089,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Geo._ Then I am sure we are very much obliged to the grasses.
5090,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5091,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,_Tut._ Well—let us now walk homeward. Some time hence you shall make a
5092,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,"collection of all the kinds of grasses, and learn to know them from each"
5093,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,other.
5094,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5095,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5096,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5097,THE GRASS-TRIBE.,
5098,A TEA LECTURE.,A TEA LECTURE.
5099,A TEA LECTURE.,
5100,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tutor_—_Pupil_.
5101,A TEA LECTURE.,
5102,A TEA LECTURE.,
5103,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tutor._ Come—the tea is ready. Lay by your book, and let us talk a"
5104,A TEA LECTURE.,"little. You have assisted in tea-making a great many times, and yet I"
5105,A TEA LECTURE.,dare say you never considered what kind of an operation it was.
5106,A TEA LECTURE.,
5107,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pupil._ An operation of cookery—is it not?
5108,A TEA LECTURE.,
5109,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ You may call it so: but it is properly an operation of
5110,A TEA LECTURE.,_chymistry_.
5111,A TEA LECTURE.,
5112,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Of chymistry! I thought that had been a very deep sort of a
5113,A TEA LECTURE.,business.
5114,A TEA LECTURE.,
5115,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ O—there are many things in common life that belong to the deepest
5116,A TEA LECTURE.,"of sciences. Making tea is the chymical operation called _infusion_,"
5117,A TEA LECTURE.,"which is, when a hot liquor is poured upon a substance in order to"
5118,A TEA LECTURE.,"extract something from it. The water, you see, extracts from the"
5119,A TEA LECTURE.,"tea-leaves their colour, taste, and flavour."
5120,A TEA LECTURE.,
5121,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Would not cold water do the same?
5122,A TEA LECTURE.,
5123,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ It would, but more slowly. Heat assists almost all liquors in"
5124,A TEA LECTURE.,their power of extracting the virtues of herbs and other substances.
5125,A TEA LECTURE.,"Thus good housewives were formerly used to boil their tea, in order to"
5126,A TEA LECTURE.,get all goodness from it as completely as possible. The greater heat and
5127,A TEA LECTURE.,agitation of boiling make it act more powerfully. The liquor in which a
5128,A TEA LECTURE.,substance has been boiled is called a _decoction_ of that substance.
5129,A TEA LECTURE.,
5130,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Then we had a decoction of mutton at dinner to-day.
5131,A TEA LECTURE.,
5132,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ We had—broth is a decoction, and so are gruel and barley-water."
5133,A TEA LECTURE.,But when anything is put to steep in a cold liquor it is called
5134,A TEA LECTURE.,_maceration_. The ingredients of which ink is made are _macerated_. In
5135,A TEA LECTURE.,"all these cases, you see, the whole substance does not mix with the"
5136,A TEA LECTURE.,"liquor, but only part of it. The reason is, that part of it is _soluble_"
5137,A TEA LECTURE.,"in the liquor, and part not."
5138,A TEA LECTURE.,
5139,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ What is the meaning of that?
5140,A TEA LECTURE.,
5141,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ Solution is when a solid put into a fluid entirely disappears in
5142,A TEA LECTURE.,"it, leaving the liquor clear. Thus when I throw this lump of sugar into"
5143,A TEA LECTURE.,"my tea, you see it gradually wastes away till it is all gone, and then I"
5144,A TEA LECTURE.,can taste it in every single drop of my tea; but the tea is as clear as
5145,A TEA LECTURE.,before.
5146,A TEA LECTURE.,
5147,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Salt would do the same.
5148,A TEA LECTURE.,
5149,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ It would. But if I were to throw in a lump of chalk, it would lie"
5150,A TEA LECTURE.,undissolved at the bottom.
5151,A TEA LECTURE.,
5152,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ But it would make the water white.
5153,A TEA LECTURE.,
5154,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ True, while it was stirred; and then it would be a _diffusion_."
5155,A TEA LECTURE.,"But while the chalk was thus mixed with the liquor, it would lose its"
5156,A TEA LECTURE.,"transparency, and not recover it again till, by standing, the chalk had"
5157,A TEA LECTURE.,all subsided and left the liquor as it was before.
5158,A TEA LECTURE.,
5159,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ How is the cream mixed with the tea?
5160,A TEA LECTURE.,
5161,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Why, that is only _diffused_, for it takes away the transparency"
5162,A TEA LECTURE.,of the tea. But the particles of cream being finer and lighter than
5163,A TEA LECTURE.,"those of chalk, it remains longer united with the liquor. However, in"
5164,A TEA LECTURE.,"time the cream would separate too, and rise to the top, leaving the tea"
5165,A TEA LECTURE.,"clear. Now, suppose you had a mixture of sugar, salt, chalk, and"
5166,A TEA LECTURE.,"tea-leaves, and were to throw it into water, either hot or cold; what"
5167,A TEA LECTURE.,would be the effect?
5168,A TEA LECTURE.,
5169,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ The sugar and salt would be dissolved and disappear. The
5170,A TEA LECTURE.,tea-leaves would yield their colour and taste. The chalk—I do not know
5171,A TEA LECTURE.,what would become of that.
5172,A TEA LECTURE.,
5173,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Why, if the mixture were stirred, the chalk would be diffused"
5174,A TEA LECTURE.,"through it, and make it _turbid_ or muddy; but on standing, it would"
5175,A TEA LECTURE.,leave it unchanged.
5176,A TEA LECTURE.,
5177,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Then there would remain at bottom the chalk and tea-leaves?
5178,A TEA LECTURE.,
5179,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Yes. The clear liquor would contain in _solution_ salt, sugar,"
5180,A TEA LECTURE.,and those particles of the tea in which its colour and taste consisted;
5181,A TEA LECTURE.,the remainder of the tea and the chalk would lie undissolved.
5182,A TEA LECTURE.,
5183,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Pup._ Then I suppose tea-leaves, after the tea is made, are lighter"
5184,A TEA LECTURE.,than at first.
5185,A TEA LECTURE.,
5186,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ Undoubtedly. If taken out and dried they would be found to have
5187,A TEA LECTURE.,"lost part of their weight, and the water would have gained it."
5188,A TEA LECTURE.,"Sometimes, however, it is an extremely small portion of a substance"
5189,A TEA LECTURE.,"which is soluble, but it is that in which its most remarkable qualities"
5190,A TEA LECTURE.,reside. Thus a small piece of spice will communicate a strong flavour to
5191,A TEA LECTURE.,"a large quantity of liquid, with very little loss of weight."
5192,A TEA LECTURE.,
5193,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Will all liquors dissolve the same things?
5194,A TEA LECTURE.,
5195,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ By no means. Many dissolve in water that will not in spirit of
5196,A TEA LECTURE.,wine; and the contrary. And upon this difference many curious matters in
5197,A TEA LECTURE.,"the arts are founded. Thus, spirit-varnish is made of a solution of"
5198,A TEA LECTURE.,various gums or resins in spirits that will not dissolve in water.
5199,A TEA LECTURE.,"Therefore, when it has been laid over any surface with a brush, and is"
5200,A TEA LECTURE.,"become dry, the rain or moisture of the air will not affect it. This is"
5201,A TEA LECTURE.,the case with the beautiful varnish laid upon coaches. On the other
5202,A TEA LECTURE.,"hand, the varnish left by gum-water could not be washed off by spirits."
5203,A TEA LECTURE.,
5204,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Pup._ I remember when I made gum-water, upon setting the cup in a warm"
5205,A TEA LECTURE.,"place, it all dried away, and left the gum just as it was before. Would"
5206,A TEA LECTURE.,the same happen if I had sugar or salt dissolved in water?
5207,A TEA LECTURE.,
5208,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Yes, upon exposing the solution to warmth, it would dry away, and"
5209,A TEA LECTURE.,you would get back your salt and sugar in a solid state as before.
5210,A TEA LECTURE.,
5211,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Pup._ But if I were to do so with a cup of tea, what should I get?"
5212,A TEA LECTURE.,
5213,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Not tea-leaves, certainly! But your question requires a little"
5214,A TEA LECTURE.,previous explanation. It is the property of heat to make most things fly
5215,A TEA LECTURE.,"off in vapour, which is called _evaporation_, or _exhalation_. But this"
5216,A TEA LECTURE.,it does in very different degrees to different substances. Some are very
5217,A TEA LECTURE.,easily made to _evaporate_; others very difficultly; and others not at
5218,A TEA LECTURE.,all by the most violent fire we can raise. Fluids in general are easily
5219,A TEA LECTURE.,_evaporable_; but not equally so. Spirit of wine flies off in vapour
5220,A TEA LECTURE.,"much sooner than water; so that if you had a mixture of the two, by"
5221,A TEA LECTURE.,"applying a gentle heat you might drive off almost all the spirit, while"
5222,A TEA LECTURE.,"the greater part of the water would remain. Water, again, is more"
5223,A TEA LECTURE.,evaporable than oil. Some solid substances are much disposed to
5224,A TEA LECTURE.,"evaporate: thus, smelling salts may by a little heat be entirely driven"
5225,A TEA LECTURE.,"away in the air. But in general, solids are more _fixed_ than fluids;"
5226,A TEA LECTURE.,"and, therefore, when a solid is dissolved in a fluid, it may commonly be"
5227,A TEA LECTURE.,recovered again by evaporation. By this operation common salt is got
5228,A TEA LECTURE.,"from seawater and salt springs, both artificially, and, in hot"
5229,A TEA LECTURE.,"countries, by the natural heat of the sun. When the water is no more"
5230,A TEA LECTURE.,"than is just sufficient to dissolve the salt, it is called a _saturated"
5231,A TEA LECTURE.,"solution_, and on evaporating the water further, the salt begins to"
5232,A TEA LECTURE.,"separate, forming little regular masses called _crystals_. Sugar may be"
5233,A TEA LECTURE.,"made in like manner to form crystals, and then it is sugar-candy."
5234,A TEA LECTURE.,
5235,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ But what is a sirup?
5236,A TEA LECTURE.,
5237,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ That is when so much sugar is dissolved as sensibly to thicken
5238,A TEA LECTURE.,"the liquor, but not to separate from it. Well—now to your question about"
5239,A TEA LECTURE.,"tea. On exposing it to considerable heat, those fine particles in which"
5240,A TEA LECTURE.,"its flavour consists, being as _volatile_ or evaporable as the water,"
5241,A TEA LECTURE.,"would fly off along with it; and when the liquor came to dryness, there"
5242,A TEA LECTURE.,would be left only those particles in which its roughness and colour
5243,A TEA LECTURE.,consist. This would make what is called an _extract_ of a plant.
5244,A TEA LECTURE.,
5245,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ What becomes of the water that evaporates?
5246,A TEA LECTURE.,
5247,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ It ascends into the air, and unites with it. But if in its way it"
5248,A TEA LECTURE.,"be stopped by any cold body, it is _condensed_, that is, it returns to"
5249,A TEA LECTURE.,the state of water again. Lift up the lid of the teapot and you will
5250,A TEA LECTURE.,"find water collected on the inside of it, which is condensed steam from"
5251,A TEA LECTURE.,the hot tea beneath. Hold a spoon or knife in the way of the steam which
5252,A TEA LECTURE.,"bursts out of the spout of the teakettle, and you will find it"
5253,A TEA LECTURE.,immediately covered with drops. This operation of turning a fluid into
5254,A TEA LECTURE.,"vapour, and then condensing it, is called _distillation_. For this"
5255,A TEA LECTURE.,"purpose, the vessel in which the liquor is heated is closely covered"
5256,A TEA LECTURE.,"with another called the head, into which the steam rises and is"
5257,A TEA LECTURE.,condensed. It is then drawn off by means of a pipe into another vessel
5258,A TEA LECTURE.,called the receiver. In this way all sweet-scented and aromatic liquors
5259,A TEA LECTURE.,"are drawn from fragrant vegetables, by means of water or spirits. The"
5260,A TEA LECTURE.,fragrant part being very volatile rises along with the steam of the
5261,A TEA LECTURE.,"water or spirit, and remains united with it after it is condensed."
5262,A TEA LECTURE.,"Rosewater, and spirits of lavender, are liquors of this kind."
5263,A TEA LECTURE.,
5264,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ Then the water collected on the inside of the teapot-lid should
5265,A TEA LECTURE.,have the fragrance of the tea.
5266,A TEA LECTURE.,
5267,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ It should—but unless the tea were fine, you could scarcely"
5268,A TEA LECTURE.,perceive it.
5269,A TEA LECTURE.,
5270,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ I think I have heard of making salt water fresh by distilling.
5271,A TEA LECTURE.,
5272,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ Yes. That is an old discovery lately revived. The salt in
5273,A TEA LECTURE.,"seawater, being of a fixed nature, does not rise with the steam; and"
5274,A TEA LECTURE.,"therefore, on condensing the steam, the water is found to be fresh. And"
5275,A TEA LECTURE.,this indeed is the method nature employs in raising water by exhalation
5276,A TEA LECTURE.,"from the ocean, which, collecting in clouds, is condensed in the cold"
5277,A TEA LECTURE.,"region of the air, and falls down in rain."
5278,A TEA LECTURE.,
5279,A TEA LECTURE.,But our tea is done: so we will now put an end to our chymical lecture.
5280,A TEA LECTURE.,
5281,A TEA LECTURE.,_Pup._ But is this real chymistry?
5282,A TEA LECTURE.,
5283,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Tut._ Yes, it is."
5284,A TEA LECTURE.,
5285,A TEA LECTURE.,"_Pup._ Why, I understand it all without any difficulty."
5286,A TEA LECTURE.,
5287,A TEA LECTURE.,_Tut._ I intended you should.

5292,THE KIDNAPPERS.,THE KIDNAPPERS.
5293,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5294,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5295,THE KIDNAPPERS.,Mr. B. was accustomed to read in the evening to his young folks some
5296,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"select story, and then ask them in turn what they thought of it. From"
5297,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"the reflections they made on these occasions, he was enabled to form a"
5298,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"judgment of their dispositions, and was led to throw in remarks of his"
5299,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"own, by which their hearts and understandings might be improved. One"
5300,THE KIDNAPPERS.,night he read the following narrative from Churchill’s Voyages:—
5301,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5302,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"“In some voyages of discovery made from Denmark to Greenland, the"
5303,THE KIDNAPPERS.,sailors were instructed to seize some of the natives by force or
5304,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"stratagem, and bring them away. In consequence of these orders, several"
5305,THE KIDNAPPERS.,Greenlanders were kidnapped and brought to Denmark. Though they were
5306,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"treated there with kindness, the poor wretches were always melancholy,"
5307,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"and were observed frequently to turn their faces toward the north, and"
5308,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"sigh bitterly. They made several attempts to escape, by putting out to"
5309,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"sea in their little canoes, which had been brought with them. One of"
5310,THE KIDNAPPERS.,them had got as far as thirty leagues from land before he was overtaken.
5311,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"It was remarked that this poor man, whenever he met a woman with a child"
5312,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"in her arms, used to utter a deep sigh; whence it was conjectured that"
5313,THE KIDNAPPERS.,he had left a wife and child behind him. They all pined away one after
5314,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"another, and died miserably.”"
5315,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5316,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"“Now, Edward,” said he, “what is your opinion of this story?”"
5317,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5318,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ Poor creatures! I think it was barbarous to take them from home.
5319,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5320,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ It was, indeed!"
5321,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5322,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ Have civilized nations any right to behave so to savages?
5323,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5324,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ I think you may readily answer that question yourself. Suppose
5325,THE KIDNAPPERS.,you were a savage—what would be your opinion?
5326,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5327,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ I dare say I should think it very wrong. But can savages think
5328,THE KIDNAPPERS.,about right and wrong as we do?
5329,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5330,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ Why not? are they not men?
5331,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5332,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Ed._ Yes; but not like civilized men, sure?"
5333,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5334,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ I know no important difference between ourselves and those
5335,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"people we are pleased to call savage, but in the degree of knowledge and"
5336,THE KIDNAPPERS.,virtue possessed by each. And I believe many individuals among the
5337,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"Greenlanders as well as other unpolished people, exceed in these"
5338,THE KIDNAPPERS.,respects many among us. In the present case I am sure the Danish sailors
5339,THE KIDNAPPERS.,showed themselves the greater savages.
5340,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5341,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ But what did they take away the Greenlanders for?
5342,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5343,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ The pretence was, that they might be brought to be instructed"
5344,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"in a Christian country, and then sent back to civilize their countrymen."
5345,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5346,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ And was not that a good thing?
5347,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5348,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ Certainly, if it were done by proper means; but to attempt it"
5349,THE KIDNAPPERS.,by an act of violence and injustice could not be right: for they could
5350,THE KIDNAPPERS.,teach them nothing so good as their example was bad; and the poor people
5351,THE KIDNAPPERS.,were not likely to learn willingly from those who had begun with
5352,THE KIDNAPPERS.,injuring them so cruelly.
5353,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5354,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Ed._ I remember Captain Cook, brought over somebody from Otaheite; and"
5355,THE KIDNAPPERS.,poor Lee Boo was brought here from the Pelew islands. But I believe they
5356,THE KIDNAPPERS.,both came of their own accord?
5357,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5358,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ They did. And it is a great proof of the better way of thinking
5359,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"of modern voyagers than former ones, that they do not consider it as"
5360,THE KIDNAPPERS.,justifiable to use violence even for the supposed benefit of the people
5361,THE KIDNAPPERS.,they visit.
5362,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5363,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Ed._ I have read of taking possession of a newly-discovered country by
5364,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"setting up the king’s standard or some such ceremony, though it was full"
5365,THE KIDNAPPERS.,of inhabitants.
5366,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5367,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ Such was formerly the custom; and a more impudent mockery of
5368,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"all right and justice can scarcely be conceived. Yet this, I am sorry to"
5369,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"say, is the title by which European nations claim the greatest part of"
5370,THE KIDNAPPERS.,their foreign settlements.
5371,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5372,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Ed._ And might not the natives drive them out again, if they were able?"
5373,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5374,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ I am sure I do not know why they might not; _for force can
5375,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"never give right_. Now, Harry, tell me what _you_ think of the story."
5376,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5377,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Harry._ I think it very strange that people should want to go back to
5378,THE KIDNAPPERS.,such a cold dismal place as Greenland.
5379,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5380,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ Why what country do you love best in the world?
5381,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5382,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Har._ England, to be sure!"
5383,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5384,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mr. B._ But England is by no means the warmest and finest country. Here
5385,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"are no grapes growing in the fields, nor oranges in the woods and"
5386,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"hedges, as there are in more southern climates."
5387,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5388,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Har._ I should like them very well, to be sure—but then England is my"
5389,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"own native country, where you and mamma and all my friends live. Besides"
5390,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"it is a very pleasant country, too."
5391,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5392,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ As to your first reason, you must be sensible that the"
5393,THE KIDNAPPERS.,Greenlander can say just the same; and the poor fellow who left a wife
5394,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"and children behind, must have had the strongest of all ties to make him"
5395,THE KIDNAPPERS.,wish to return. Do you think I should be easy to be separated from all
5396,THE KIDNAPPERS.,of you?
5397,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5398,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Har._ No; and I am sure we should not be easy, neither."
5399,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5400,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ Home, my dear, wherever it is, is the spot toward which a good"
5401,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"heart is the most strongly drawn. Then, as for the pleasantness of a"
5402,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"place, that all depends upon habit. The Greenlander, being accustomed to"
5403,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"the way of living, and all the objects of his own country, could not"
5404,THE KIDNAPPERS.,relish any other so well. He loved whale-fat and seal as well as you can
5405,THE KIDNAPPERS.,do pudding and beef. He thought rowing his little boat amid the
5406,THE KIDNAPPERS.,boisterous waves pleasanter employment than driving a plough or a cart.
5407,THE KIDNAPPERS.,He fenced himself against the winter’s cold by warm clothing; and the
5408,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"long night of many weeks, which you would think so gloomy, was to him a"
5409,THE KIDNAPPERS.,season of ease and festivity in his habitation underground. It is a very
5410,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"kind and wise dispensation of Providence, that every part of the world"
5411,THE KIDNAPPERS.,is rendered most agreeable to those who live in it.
5412,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5413,THE KIDNAPPERS.,Now little Mary what have you to say?
5414,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5415,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mary._ I have only to say, that if they were to offer to carry me away"
5416,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"from home, I would scratch their eyes out!"
5417,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5418,THE KIDNAPPERS.,"_Mr. B._ Well said, my girl! stand up for yourself. Let nobody run away"
5419,THE KIDNAPPERS.,with you—_against your will_.
5420,THE KIDNAPPERS.,
5421,THE KIDNAPPERS.,_Mary._ That I won’t.

5432,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5433,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Father_—_Henry._
5434,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5435,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5436,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Henry._ My dear father, you observed the other day that we had a great"
5437,ON MANUFACTURES.,"many manufactures in England. Pray, what is a manufacture?"
5438,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5439,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Father._ A manufacture is something made by the hand of man. It is
5440,ON MANUFACTURES.,"derived from two Latin words, _manus_, the hand, and _facere_, to make."
5441,ON MANUFACTURES.,"Manufactures are therefore opposed to productions, which latter are what"
5442,ON MANUFACTURES.,"the bounty of nature spontaneously affords; as fruits, corn, marble."
5443,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5444,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ But there is a great deal of trouble with corn: you have often
5445,ON MANUFACTURES.,made me take notice how much pains it costs the farmer to plough his
5446,ON MANUFACTURES.,"ground, and put the seed in the earth, and keep it clear from weeds."
5447,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5448,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Very true: but the farmer does not make the corn; he only prepares
5449,ON MANUFACTURES.,"for it a proper soil and situation, and removes every hinderance arising"
5450,ON MANUFACTURES.,"from the hardness of the ground, or the neighbourhood of other plants,"
5451,ON MANUFACTURES.,which might obstruct the secret and wonderful process of vegetation; but
5452,ON MANUFACTURES.,with the vegetation itself he has nothing to do. It is not _his_ hand
5453,ON MANUFACTURES.,"that draws out the slender fibres of the root, pushes up the green"
5454,ON MANUFACTURES.,"stalk, and by degrees the spiky ear; swells the grain, and embrowns it"
5455,ON MANUFACTURES.,"with that rich tinge of tawny russet, which informs the husbandman it is"
5456,ON MANUFACTURES.,time to put in his sickle: all this operation is performed without his
5457,ON MANUFACTURES.,"care, or even knowledge."
5458,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5459,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Now, then, I understand; corn is a _production_, and bread is a"
5460,ON MANUFACTURES.,_manufacture_.
5461,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5462,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ Bread is certainly, in strictness of speech, a manufacture; but we"
5463,ON MANUFACTURES.,do not in general apply the term to anything in which the original
5464,ON MANUFACTURES.,material is so little changed. If we wanted to speak of bread
5465,ON MANUFACTURES.,"philosophically, we should say, it is a preparation of corn."
5466,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5467,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Is sugar a manufacture?
5468,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5469,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ No, for the same reason. Besides which, I do not recollect the"
5470,ON MANUFACTURES.,term being applied to any article of food; I suppose from an idea that
5471,ON MANUFACTURES.,"food is of too perishable a nature, and generally obtained by a process"
5472,ON MANUFACTURES.,"too simple to deserve the name. We say, therefore, sugar-works,"
5473,ON MANUFACTURES.,"oil-mills, chocolate-works; we do not say a beer-manufactory, but a"
5474,ON MANUFACTURES.,"brewery; but this is only a nicety of language, for properly all those"
5475,ON MANUFACTURES.,"are manufactories, if there is much of art and curiosity in the process."
5476,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5477,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Do we say a manufactory of pictures?
5478,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5479,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ No; but for a different reason. A picture, especially if it belong"
5480,ON MANUFACTURES.,"to any of the higher kinds of painting, is an effort of genius. A"
5481,ON MANUFACTURES.,picture cannot be produced by any given combinations of canvass and
5482,ON MANUFACTURES.,"colour. It is the hand, indeed, that executes, but the head that works."
5483,ON MANUFACTURES.,"Sir Joshua Reynolds could not have gone, when he was engaged to paint a"
5484,ON MANUFACTURES.,"picture, and hired workmen, the one to draw the eyes, another the nose,"
5485,ON MANUFACTURES.,"a third the mouth: the whole must be the painter’s own, that particular"
5486,ON MANUFACTURES.,"painter’s, and no other; and no one who has not his ideas can do his"
5487,ON MANUFACTURES.,"work. His work is therefore nobler, of a higher species."
5488,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5489,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Pray, give me an instance of a manufacture."
5490,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5491,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ The making of watches is a manufacture: the silver, iron, gold, or"
5492,ON MANUFACTURES.,"whatever else is used in it, are productions, the materials of the work;"
5493,ON MANUFACTURES.,but it is by the wonderful art of man that they are wrought into the
5494,ON MANUFACTURES.,numberless wheels and springs of which this complicated machine is
5495,ON MANUFACTURES.,composed.
5496,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5497,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Then is there not as much art in making a watch as a picture?
5498,ON MANUFACTURES.,Does not the head work?
5499,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5500,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ Certainly, in the original invention of watches, as much, or more,"
5501,ON MANUFACTURES.,"than in painting; but when once invented, the art of watchmaking is"
5502,ON MANUFACTURES.,"capable of being reduced to a mere mechanical labour, which may be"
5503,ON MANUFACTURES.,"exercised by any man of common capacity, according to certain precise"
5504,ON MANUFACTURES.,"rules, when made familiar to him by practice: of this painting is not"
5505,ON MANUFACTURES.,capable.
5506,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5507,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ But, my dear father, making books surely requires a great deal of"
5508,ON MANUFACTURES.,thinking and study; and yet I remember the other day at dinner a
5509,ON MANUFACTURES.,gentleman said that Mr. Pica had manufactured a large volume in less
5510,ON MANUFACTURES.,than a fortnight.
5511,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5512,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ It was meant to convey a satirical remark on his book because it
5513,ON MANUFACTURES.,"was compiled from other authors, from whom he had taken a page in one"
5514,ON MANUFACTURES.,"place, and a page in another; so that it was not produced by the labour"
5515,ON MANUFACTURES.,"of his brain, but of his hands. Thus you heard your mother complain that"
5516,ON MANUFACTURES.,the London cream was manufactured; which was a pointed and concise way
5517,ON MANUFACTURES.,"of saying that the cream was not what it ought to be, or what it"
5518,ON MANUFACTURES.,"pretended to be: for cream, when genuine, is a pure production; but when"
5519,ON MANUFACTURES.,"mixed up and adulterated with flour and isinglass, and I know not what,"
5520,ON MANUFACTURES.,"it becomes a manufacture. It was as much as to say, art has been here"
5521,ON MANUFACTURES.,"where it has no business; where it is not beneficial, but hurtful. A"
5522,ON MANUFACTURES.,great deal of the delicacy of language depends upon an accurate
5523,ON MANUFACTURES.,"knowledge of the specific meaning of single terms, and a nice attention"
5524,ON MANUFACTURES.,to their relative propriety.
5525,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5526,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Have all nations manufactures?
5527,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5528,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ All that are in any degree cultivated; but it very often happens
5529,ON MANUFACTURES.,that countries naturally the poorest have manufactures of the greatest
5530,ON MANUFACTURES.,extent and variety.
5531,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5532,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Why so?
5533,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5534,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ For the same reason, I apprehend, that individuals, who are rich"
5535,ON MANUFACTURES.,"without any labour of their own, are seldom so industrious and active as"
5536,ON MANUFACTURES.,"those who depend upon their own exertions: thus the Spaniards, who"
5537,ON MANUFACTURES.,"possess the richest gold and silver mines in the world, are in want of"
5538,ON MANUFACTURES.,many conveniences of life which are enjoyed in London and Amsterdam.
5539,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5540,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ I can comprehend that: I believe if my uncle Leger were to find a
5541,ON MANUFACTURES.,"gold mine under his warehouse, he would soon shut up his shop."
5542,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5543,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ I believe so. It is not, however, easy to establish manufactures"
5544,ON MANUFACTURES.,in a _very poor_ nation: they require science and genius for their
5545,ON MANUFACTURES.,"invention, art and contrivance for their execution; order, peace, and"
5546,ON MANUFACTURES.,"union, for their flourishing. They require, too, a number of men to"
5547,ON MANUFACTURES.,"combine together in an undertaking, and to prosecute it with the most"
5548,ON MANUFACTURES.,"patient industry; they require, therefore, laws and government for their"
5549,ON MANUFACTURES.,"protection. If you see extensive manufactures in any nation, you may be"
5550,ON MANUFACTURES.,"sure it is a civilized nation, you may be sure property is accurately"
5551,ON MANUFACTURES.,ascertained and protected. They require great expenses for their first
5552,ON MANUFACTURES.,"establishment, costly machines for shortening manual labour, and money"
5553,ON MANUFACTURES.,and credit for purchasing materials from distant countries. There is not
5554,ON MANUFACTURES.,"a single manufacture of Great Britain which does not require, in some"
5555,ON MANUFACTURES.,"part or other of its process, productions from the different parts of"
5556,ON MANUFACTURES.,"the globe, oils, drugs, varnish, quicksilver, and the like: it requires,"
5557,ON MANUFACTURES.,"therefore, _ships_ and a friendly intercourse with foreign nations, to"
5558,ON MANUFACTURES.,transport commodities and exchange productions. We could not be a
5559,ON MANUFACTURES.,"manufacturing, unless we were also a commercial nation. They require"
5560,ON MANUFACTURES.,"time to take root in any place, and their excellence often depends upon"
5561,ON MANUFACTURES.,"some nice and delicate circumstance; a peculiar quality, for instance,"
5562,ON MANUFACTURES.,"in the air or water, or some other local circumstance not easily"
5563,ON MANUFACTURES.,"ascertained. Thus, I have heard that the Irish women spin better than"
5564,ON MANUFACTURES.,"the English, because the moister temperature of their climate makes"
5565,ON MANUFACTURES.,their skin more soft and their fingers more flexible: thus again we
5566,ON MANUFACTURES.,"cannot die so beautiful a scarlet as the French can, though with the"
5567,ON MANUFACTURES.,"same drugs, perhaps on account of the superior purity of the air. But"
5568,ON MANUFACTURES.,though so much is necessary for the perfection of the more curious and
5569,ON MANUFACTURES.,"complicated manufactures, all nations possess those which are"
5570,ON MANUFACTURES.,"subservient to the common conveniences of life;—the loom and the forge,"
5571,ON MANUFACTURES.,"particularly, are of the highest antiquity."
5572,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5573,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Yes; I remember Hector bids Andromache return to her apartments,"
5574,ON MANUFACTURES.,and employ herself in weaving with her maids; and I remember the shield
5575,ON MANUFACTURES.,of Achilles.
5576,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5577,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ True; and you likewise remember, in an earlier period, the fine"
5578,ON MANUFACTURES.,"linen of Egypt: and to go still higher, the working of iron and brass is"
5579,ON MANUFACTURES.,recorded of Tubal-Cain before the flood.
5580,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5581,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Which is the most important, manufactures or agriculture?"
5582,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5583,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ Agriculture is the most _necessary_, because it is first of all"
5584,ON MANUFACTURES.,necessary that man should live; but almost all the enjoyments and
5585,ON MANUFACTURES.,comforts of life are produced by manufactures.
5586,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5587,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Why are we obliged to take so much pains to make ourselves
5588,ON MANUFACTURES.,comfortable?
5589,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5590,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ To exercise our industry. Nature provides the materials for man.
5591,ON MANUFACTURES.,"She pours out at his feet a profusion of gems, metals, dies, plants,"
5592,ON MANUFACTURES.,"ores, bark, stones, gums, wax, marbles, woods, roots, skins, earth, and"
5593,ON MANUFACTURES.,minerals of all kinds! She has likewise given him tools.
5594,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5595,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ I did not know that nature gave us tools.
5596,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5597,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ No! what are those two instruments you carry always about with
5598,ON MANUFACTURES.,"you, so strong and yet so flexible, so nicely jointed, and branched out"
5599,ON MANUFACTURES.,"into five long, taper, unequal divisions, any of which may be contracted"
5600,ON MANUFACTURES.,or stretched out at pleasure; the extremities of which have a feeling so
5601,ON MANUFACTURES.,"wonderfully delicate, and which are strengthened and defended by horn?"
5602,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5603,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ The hands?
5604,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5605,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ Yes. Man is as much superior to the brutes in his outward form, by"
5606,ON MANUFACTURES.,"means of the hand, as he is in his mind by the gifts of reason. The"
5607,ON MANUFACTURES.,trunk of the elephant comes perhaps the nearest to it in its exquisite
5608,ON MANUFACTURES.,"feeling and flexibility, (it is, indeed, called his hand in Latin,) and"
5609,ON MANUFACTURES.,accordingly that animal has always been reckoned the wisest of brutes.
5610,ON MANUFACTURES.,"When Nature gave man the hand, she said to him. “Exercise your ingenuity"
5611,ON MANUFACTURES.,"and work.” As soon as ever a man rises above the state of a savage, he"
5612,ON MANUFACTURES.,"begins to contrive and to make things, in order to improve his forlorn"
5613,ON MANUFACTURES.,condition: thus you may remember Thomson represents Industry coming to
5614,ON MANUFACTURES.,"the poor shivering wretch, and teaching him the arts of life:—"
5615,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5616,ON MANUFACTURES.,"“Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the stone,"
5617,ON MANUFACTURES.,Till by degrees the finished fabric rose;
5618,ON MANUFACTURES.,"Tore from his limbs the bloody-polluted fur,"
5619,ON MANUFACTURES.,"And wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm,"
5620,ON MANUFACTURES.,Or bright in glossy silk and flowing lawn.”
5621,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5622,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ It must require a great deal of knowledge, I suppose, for so many"
5623,ON MANUFACTURES.,curious works; what kind of knowledge is most necessary?
5624,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5625,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ There is not any which may not be occasionally employed; but the
5626,ON MANUFACTURES.,two sciences which most assist the manufacturer are _mechanics_ and
5627,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_chymistry_; the one for building mills, working mines, and in general"
5628,ON MANUFACTURES.,"for constructing wheels, wedges, pulleys, &c., either to shorten the"
5629,ON MANUFACTURES.,"labour of man, by performing it in less time, or to perform what the"
5630,ON MANUFACTURES.,strength of man alone could not accomplish; the other in fusing and
5631,ON MANUFACTURES.,"working ores, in dying and bleaching, and extracting the virtues of"
5632,ON MANUFACTURES.,"various substances for particular uses; making of soap, for instance, is"
5633,ON MANUFACTURES.,a chymical operation; and by chymistry an ingenious gentleman has lately
5634,ON MANUFACTURES.,"found out a way of bleaching a piece of cloth in eight-and-forty hours,"
5635,ON MANUFACTURES.,which by the common process would have taken up a great many weeks. You
5636,ON MANUFACTURES.,"have heard of Sir Richard Arkwright, who died lately?"
5637,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5638,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Yes, I have heard he was at first only a barber, and shaved"
5639,ON MANUFACTURES.,people for a penny apiece.
5640,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5641,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ He did so; but having a strong turn for mechanics, he invented, or"
5642,ON MANUFACTURES.,"at least perfected a machine, by which one pair of hands may do the work"
5643,ON MANUFACTURES.,"of twenty or thirty; and, as in this country every one is free to rise"
5644,ON MANUFACTURES.,"by merit, he acquired the largest fortune in the country, had a great"
5645,ON MANUFACTURES.,"many hundreds of workmen under his orders, and had leave given him by"
5646,ON MANUFACTURES.,the king to put _Sir_ before his name.
5647,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5648,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Did that do him any good?
5649,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5650,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ It pleased him, I suppose, or he would not have accepted of it;"
5651,ON MANUFACTURES.,"and you will allow, I imagine, that if titles are used, it does honour"
5652,ON MANUFACTURES.,"to those who bestow them, when they are given to such as have made"
5653,ON MANUFACTURES.,"themselves noticed for something useful. Arkwright used to say, that if"
5654,ON MANUFACTURES.,"he had time to perfect his inventions, he would put a fleece of wool"
5655,ON MANUFACTURES.,"into a box, and it should come out broadcloth."
5656,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5657,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ What did he mean by that? Was there any fairy in the box to turn
5658,ON MANUFACTURES.,it into broadcloth with her wand?
5659,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5660,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ He was assisted by the only fairies that ever had the power of
5661,ON MANUFACTURES.,transformation—art and industry: he meant that he would contrive so many
5662,ON MANUFACTURES.,"machines, wheel within wheel, that the combing, carding, and various"
5663,ON MANUFACTURES.,"other operations, should be performed by mechanism, almost without the"
5664,ON MANUFACTURES.,hand of man.
5665,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5666,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ I think, if I had not been told, I should never have been able to"
5667,ON MANUFACTURES.,guess that my coat came off the back of the sheep.
5668,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5669,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ You hardly would; but there are manufactures in which the material
5670,ON MANUFACTURES.,is much more changed than in woollen cloth. What can be meaner in
5671,ON MANUFACTURES.,appearance than sand and ashes? Would you imagine anything beautiful
5672,ON MANUFACTURES.,could be made out of such a mixture? Yet the furnace transforms this
5673,ON MANUFACTURES.,"into that transparent crystal we call glass, than which nothing is more"
5674,ON MANUFACTURES.,"sparkling, more brilliant, more full of lustre. It throws about the rays"
5675,ON MANUFACTURES.,of light as if it had life and motion.
5676,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5677,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ There is a glass shop in London which always puts me in mind of
5678,ON MANUFACTURES.,Aladdin’s palace.
5679,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5680,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ It is certain that if a person, ignorant of the manufacture, were"
5681,ON MANUFACTURES.,"to see one of our capital shops, he would think all the treasures of"
5682,ON MANUFACTURES.,"Golconda were centred there, and that every drop of cut-glass was worth"
5683,ON MANUFACTURES.,"a prince’s ransom. Again, who would suppose, on seeing the green stalks"
5684,ON MANUFACTURES.,"of a plant, that it could be formed into a texture so smooth, so"
5685,ON MANUFACTURES.,"snowy-white, so firm, and yet so flexible as to wrap round the limbs,"
5686,ON MANUFACTURES.,and adapt itself to every movement of the body? Who would guess this
5687,ON MANUFACTURES.,fibrous stalk could be made to float in such light undulating folds as
5688,ON MANUFACTURES.,"in our lawns and cambrics; not less fine, we presume, than that"
5689,ON MANUFACTURES.,"transparent drapery which the Romans called _ventus textilis_, _woven"
5690,ON MANUFACTURES.,wind_?
5691,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5692,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ I wonder how anybody can spin such fine thread!
5693,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5694,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ Their fingers must have the touch of a spider, that, as Pope says,"
5695,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5696,ON MANUFACTURES.,"“Feels at each thread, and lives along the line;”"
5697,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5698,ON MANUFACTURES.,"and, indeed, you recollect that Arachne was a spinster. Lace is a still"
5699,ON MANUFACTURES.,"finer production from flax, and is one of those in which the original"
5700,ON MANUFACTURES.,material is most improved. How many times the price of a pound of flax
5701,ON MANUFACTURES.,do you think that flax will be worth when made into lace?
5702,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5703,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ A great many times, I suppose."
5704,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5705,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Flax at the best hand is bought at fourteen pence a pound. They
5706,ON MANUFACTURES.,"make lace at Valenciennes, in French Flanders, of ten guineas a yard—I"
5707,ON MANUFACTURES.,"believe, indeed, higher—but we will say ten guineas; this yard of lace"
5708,ON MANUFACTURES.,will weigh probably more than half an ounce: what is the value of half
5709,ON MANUFACTURES.,an ounce of flax?
5710,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5711,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ It comes to one farthing and three quarters of a farthing.
5712,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5713,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Right: now tell me how many times the original value the lace is
5714,ON MANUFACTURES.,worth.
5715,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5716,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ Prodigious! it is worth 5760 times as much as the flax it is made
5717,ON MANUFACTURES.,of!
5718,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5719,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Yet there is another material that is still more improveable than
5720,ON MANUFACTURES.,flax.
5721,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5722,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ What can that be?
5723,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5724,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Iron. The price of pig-iron is ten shillings a hundred weight;
5725,ON MANUFACTURES.,this is not quite one farthing for two ounces: now you have seen some of
5726,ON MANUFACTURES.,the beautiful cut-steel that looks like diamonds?
5727,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5728,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Yes, I have seen buckles, and pins, and watchchains."
5729,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5730,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ Then you can form an idea of it: but you have only seen the most
5731,ON MANUFACTURES.,"common sorts. There was a chain made at Woodstock, in Oxford shire, and"
5732,ON MANUFACTURES.,"sent to France, which weighed only two ounces, and cost 170_l._"
5733,ON MANUFACTURES.,Calculate how many times that had increased its value.
5734,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5735,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Amazing! it was worth 163,600 times the value of the iron it was"
5736,ON MANUFACTURES.,made of!
5737,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5738,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ That is what manufacture can do: here man is a kind of creator
5739,ON MANUFACTURES.,"and, like the great Creator, he may please himself with his work, and"
5740,ON MANUFACTURES.,"say it is good. In the last-mentioned manufacture, too, that of steel,"
5741,ON MANUFACTURES.,the English have the honour of excelling all the world.
5742,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5743,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Hen._ What are the chief manufactures of England?
5744,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5745,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ We have at present a greater variety than I can pretend to
5746,ON MANUFACTURES.,"enumerate, but our staple manufacture is woollen cloth. England abounds"
5747,ON MANUFACTURES.,"in fine pastures and extensive downs, which feed great numbers of sheep:"
5748,ON MANUFACTURES.,hence our wool has always been a valuable article of trade; but we did
5749,ON MANUFACTURES.,not always know how to work it. We used to sell it to the Flemish or
5750,ON MANUFACTURES.,"Lombards, who wrought it into cloth; till, in the year 1326, Edward the"
5751,ON MANUFACTURES.,Third invited some Flemish weavers over to teach us the art; but there
5752,ON MANUFACTURES.,was not much made in England till the reign of Henry the Seventh.
5753,ON MANUFACTURES.,Manchester and Birmingham are towns which have arisen to great
5754,ON MANUFACTURES.,"consequence from small beginnings, almost within the memory of old men"
5755,ON MANUFACTURES.,"now living; the first for cotton and muslin goods, the second for"
5756,ON MANUFACTURES.,"cutlery and hardware, in which we at this moment excel all Europe. Of"
5757,ON MANUFACTURES.,"late years, too, carpets, beautiful as fine tapestry, have been"
5758,ON MANUFACTURES.,fabricated in this country. Our clocks and watches are greatly esteemed.
5759,ON MANUFACTURES.,"The earthenware plates and dishes, which we all use in common, and the"
5760,ON MANUFACTURES.,"elegant set for the tea-table, ornamented with musical instruments,"
5761,ON MANUFACTURES.,"which we admired in our visit yesterday, belong to a very extensive"
5762,ON MANUFACTURES.,"manufactory, the seat of which is at Burslem, in Staffordshire. The"
5763,ON MANUFACTURES.,"principal potteries there belong to one person, an excellent chymist,"
5764,ON MANUFACTURES.,"and a man of great taste; he, in conjunction with another man of taste,"
5765,ON MANUFACTURES.,"who is since dead, has made our clay more valuable than the finest"
5766,ON MANUFACTURES.,porcelain of China. He has moulded it into all the forms of grace and
5767,ON MANUFACTURES.,beauty that are to be met with in the precious remains of the Greek and
5768,ON MANUFACTURES.,Etruscan artists. In the more common articles he has pencilled it with
5769,ON MANUFACTURES.,"the most elegant designs, shaped it into shells and leaves, twisted it"
5770,ON MANUFACTURES.,"into wickerwork, and trailed the ductile foliage round the light basket."
5771,ON MANUFACTURES.,"He has filled our cabinets and chimney-pieces with urns, lamps, and"
5772,ON MANUFACTURES.,"vases, on which are lightly traced, with the purest simplicity, the fine"
5773,ON MANUFACTURES.,"forms and floating draperies of Herculaneum. In short, he has given to"
5774,ON MANUFACTURES.,"our houses a classic air, and has made every saloon and every"
5775,ON MANUFACTURES.,dining-room schools of taste. I should add that there is a great demand
5776,ON MANUFACTURES.,abroad for this elegant manufacture. The emperess of Russia has some
5777,ON MANUFACTURES.,magnificent services of it; and the other day one was sent to the king
5778,ON MANUFACTURES.,"of Spain, intended as a present from him to the archbishop of Toledo,"
5779,ON MANUFACTURES.,which cost a thousand pounds. Some morning you shall go through the
5780,ON MANUFACTURES.,rooms in the London warehouse.
5781,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5782,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ I should like very much to see manufactures, now you have told me"
5783,ON MANUFACTURES.,some curious things about them.
5784,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5785,ON MANUFACTURES.,_Fa._ You will do well! There is much more entertainment to a cultivated
5786,ON MANUFACTURES.,"mind in seeing a pin made, than in many a fashionable diversion which"
5787,ON MANUFACTURES.,young people half ruin themselves to attend. In the meantime I will give
5788,ON MANUFACTURES.,"you some account of one of the most elegant of them, which is _paper_."
5789,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5790,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Hen._ Pray do, my dear father."
5791,ON MANUFACTURES.,
5792,ON MANUFACTURES.,"_Fa._ It shall be left for another evening, however, for it is now late."
5793,ON MANUFACTURES.,Good-night.

5810,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5811,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Charles._ It is a horse.
5812,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5813,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Whose horse is it?
5814,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5815,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ I do not know; I never saw it before.
5816,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5817,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ How do you know it is a horse, if you never saw it before?"
5818,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5819,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Because it is like other horses.
5820,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5821,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Are all horses alike, then?"
5822,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5823,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Yes.
5824,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5825,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ If they are alike, how do you know one horse from another?"
5826,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5827,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ They are not quite alike.
5828,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5829,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ But they are so much alike, that you can easily distinguish a"
5830,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,horse from a cow?
5831,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5832,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Yes, indeed."
5833,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5834,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Or from a cabbage?
5835,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5836,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ A horse from a cabbage? yes, surely I can."
5837,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5838,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Very well; then let us see if you can tell how a horse differs
5839,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,from a cabbage?
5840,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5841,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Very easily; a horse is alive?
5842,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5843,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ True; and how is every thing called which is alive?
5844,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5845,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ I believe all things that are alive are called _animals_.
5846,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5847,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Right; but can you tell me what a horse and a cabbage are alike
5848,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,in?
5849,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5850,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Nothing, I believe."
5851,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5852,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Yes, there is one thing in which the slenderest moss that grows"
5853,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,upon the wall is like the greatest man or the highest angel.
5854,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5855,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Because God made them.
5856,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5857,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Yes: and how do you call everything that is made?
5858,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5859,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ A creature.
5860,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5861,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ A horse, then, is a creature, but also a living creature; that is"
5862,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"to say, an animal."
5863,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5864,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ And a cabbage is a dead creature: that is the difference.
5865,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5866,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Not so, neither; nothing is dead that has never been alive."
5867,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5868,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ What must I call it, then, if it is neither dead nor alive?"
5869,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5870,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ An inanimate creature; there is the animate and inanimate
5871,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"creation. Plants, stones, metals, are of the latter class; horses belong"
5872,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,to the former.
5873,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5874,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ But the gardener told me some of my cabbages were _dead_, and some"
5875,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,were _alive_.
5876,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5877,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Very true. Plants have a _vegetative_ life, a principle of growth"
5878,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,and decay; this is common to them with all organized bodies; but they
5879,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"have not sensation, at least we do not know they have—they have not"
5880,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"life, therefore in the sense in which animals enjoy it."
5881,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5882,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ A horse is called an animal, then?"
5883,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5884,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Yes; but a salmon is an animal; and so is a sparrow; how will you
5885,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,distinguish a horse from these?
5886,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5887,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ A salmon lives in the water, and swims; a sparrow flies and lives"

5889,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5890,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ I think a salmon could not walk on the ground, even if it could"

5896,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5897,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ No; It hops upon its two slender legs.

5910,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5911,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Do you know any animals which live upon the earth that have not
5912,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,four legs?
5913,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5914,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ I think not; they have all four legs, except worms and insects,"
5915,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,and such things.
5916,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5917,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ You remember, I suppose, what an animal is called that has four"

5919,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5920,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ A quadruped.
5921,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5922,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ A horse then, is a _quadruped_: by this we distinguish him from"
5923,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"birds, fishes, and insects."
5924,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5925,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ And from men.
5926,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5927,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ True; but if you had been talking about birds, you would not have"
5928,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,found it so easy to distinguish them.
5929,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5930,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ How so? a man is not at all like a bird.
5931,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5932,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Yet an ancient philosopher could find no way to distinguish them,"
5933,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,but by calling man a _two-legged animal without feathers_.
5934,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5935,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ I think he was very silly; they are not at all alike, though they"
5936,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,have both two legs.
5937,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5938,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Another ancient philosopher, called Diogenes, was of your opinion."
5939,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"He stripped a cock of his feathers, and turned him into the school where"
5940,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"Plato, that was his name, was teaching, and said, “Here is Plato’s man"

5942,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5943,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ I wish I had been there, I should have laughed very much."
5944,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5945,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Probably. Before we laugh at others, however, let us see what we"
5946,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,can do ourselves. We have not yet found anything which will distinguish
5947,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"a horse from an elephant, or from a Norway rat."
5948,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5949,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Oh, that is easy enough! An elephant is very large, and a rat is"
5950,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,very small; a horse is neither large nor small.
5951,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5952,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Before we go any farther look what is settled on the skirt of your
5953,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,coat.
5954,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5955,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ It is a butterfly: what a prodigiously large one! I never saw such
5956,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,a one before.
5957,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5958,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Is it larger than a rat, think you?"
5959,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5960,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No, that it is not."
5961,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5962,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Yet you called the butterfly large, and you called the rat small."
5963,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5964,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ It is very large for a butterfly.
5965,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5966,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ It is so. You see, therefore, that large and small are _relative"
5967,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,terms_.
5968,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5969,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ I do not well understand that phrase.
5970,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5971,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ It means that they have no precise and determinate signification
5972,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"in themselves, but are applied differently according to the other ideas"
5973,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"which you join with them, and the different positions in which you view"
5974,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"them. This butterfly, therefore, is _large_, compared with those of its"
5975,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"own species, and _small_ compared with many other species of animals."
5976,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"Besides, there is no circumstance which varies more than the size of"
5977,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"individuals. If you were to give an idea of a horse from its size, you"
5978,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,would certainly say it was much bigger than a dog; yet if you take the
5979,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"smallest Shetland horse, and the largest Irish greyhound, you will find"
5980,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"them very much upon a par; size, therefore, is not a circumstance by"
5981,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,which you can accurately distinguish one animal from another; nor yet is
5982,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,colour.
5983,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5984,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No; there are black horses, and bay, and white, and pied."
5985,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5986,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ But you have not seen that variety of colours in a hare for
5987,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,instance.
5988,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5989,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No, a hare is always brown."
5990,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5991,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Yet if you were to depend upon that circumstance, you would not"
5992,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"convey the idea of a hare to a mountaineer, or an inhabitant of Siberia;"
5993,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"for he sees them white as snow. We must, therefore find out some"
5994,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"circumstances that do not change like size and colour, and I may add"
5995,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"shape, though they are not so obvious, nor perhaps so striking. Look at"
5996,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,the feet of quadrupeds; are they all alike?
5997,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
5998,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No: some have long taper claws, and some have thick clumsy feet"
5999,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,without claws.
6000,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6001,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ The thick feet are horny: are they not?
6002,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6003,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Yes, I recollect they are called hoofs."
6004,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6005,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ And the feet that are not covered with horn and are divided into
6006,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"claws, are called _digitated_, from _digitus_, a finger; because they"
6007,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"are parted like fingers. Here, then, we have one grand division of"
6008,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,quadrupeds into _hoofed_ and _digitated_. Of which division is the
6009,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,horse?
6010,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6011,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ He is hoofed.
6012,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6013,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ There are a great many different kinds of horses; did you ever
6014,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,know one that was not hoofed?
6015,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6016,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No, never."
6017,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6018,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Do you think we run any hazard of a stranger telling us, “Sir,"
6019,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"horses are hoofed indeed in your country; but in mine, which is in a"
6020,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"different climate, and where we feed them differently, they have claws?”"
6021,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6022,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No, I dare say not."
6023,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6024,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Then we have got something to our purpose; a circumstance easily
6025,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"marked, which always belongs to the animal, under every variation of"
6026,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"situation or treatment. But an ox is hoofed, and so is a sheep; we must"
6027,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"distinguish still farther. You have often stood by, I suppose, while the"
6028,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,smith was shoeing a horse. What kind of a hoof has he?
6029,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6030,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ It is round and all in one piece.
6031,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6032,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ And is that of an ox so?
6033,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6034,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ No, it is divided."
6035,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6036,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ A horse, then, is not only hoofed but _whole-hoofed_. Now how many"
6037,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,quadrupeds do you think there are in the world that are whole-hoofed?
6038,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6039,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Indeed I do not know.
6040,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6041,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ There are, among all animals that we are acquainted with, either"
6042,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"in this country or in any other, only the horse, the ass, and the zebra,"
6043,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"which is a species of the wild ass. Now, therefore, you see we have"
6044,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,nearly accomplished our purpose; we have only to distinguish him from
6045,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,the ass.
6046,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6047,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ That is easily done, I believe; I should be sorry if any body"
6048,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,could mistake my little horse for an ass.
6049,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6050,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ It is not so easy, however, as you imagine; the eye readily"
6051,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"distinguishes them by the air and general appearance, but naturalists"
6052,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"have been rather puzzled to fix upon any specific difference, which may"
6053,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"serve the purpose of a definition. Some have, therefore, fixed upon the"
6054,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"ears, others on the mane and tail. What kind of ears has an ass?"
6055,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6056,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Oh, very long clumsy ears! Asses’ ears are always laughed at."
6057,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6058,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ And the horse?
6059,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6060,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ The horse has small ears, nicely turned and upright."
6061,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6062,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ And the mane, is there no difference there?"
6063,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6064,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ The horse has a fine long flowing mane; the ass has hardly any.
6065,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6066,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ And the tail: is it not fuller of hair in the horse than in the
6067,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,ass?
6068,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6069,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ Yes; the ass has only a few long hairs at the end of the tail; but
6070,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,the horse has a long bushy tail when it is not cut.
6071,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6072,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Which, by the way, it is a pity it ever should. Now, then, observe"
6073,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,what particulars we have got. _A horse is an animal of the quadruped
6074,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"kind, whole-hoofed, with short erect ears, a flowing mane, and a tail"
6075,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"covered in every part with long hairs._ Now is there any other animal,"
6076,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"think you, in the world, that answers these particulars?"
6077,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6078,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ I do not know; this does not tell us a great deal about him.
6079,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6080,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ And yet it tells us enough to distinguish him from all the
6081,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,different tribes of the creation which we are acquainted with in any
6082,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,part of the earth. Do you know now what we have been making?
6083,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6084,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ What?
6085,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6086,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ A DEFINITION. It is the business of a definition to distinguish
6087,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"precisely the thing defined from any other thing, and to do it in as few"
6088,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"terms as possible. Its object is to separate the subject of definition,"
6089,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"first from those with which it has only a general resemblance, then,"
6090,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,from those which agree with it in a greater variety of particulars; and
6091,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,so on till by constantly throwing out all which have not the qualities
6092,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"we have taken notice of, we come at length to the individual or the"
6093,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"species we wish to ascertain. It is a kind of chase, and resembles the"
6094,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"manner of hunting in some countries, where they first enclose a large"
6095,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"circle with their dogs, nets, and horses; and then, by degrees, draw"
6096,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"their toils closer and closer, driving their game before them till it is"
6097,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,at length brought into so narrow a compass that the sportsmen have
6098,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,nothing to do but to knock down their prey.
6099,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6100,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ Just as we have been hunting this horse, till at last we held him"
6101,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,fast by his ears and tail.
6102,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6103,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ I should observe to you, that in the definition naturalists give"
6104,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,of a horse it is generally mentioned that he has six cutting teeth in
6105,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,each jaw; because this circumstance of the teeth has been found a very
6106,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,convenient one for characterizing large classes: but as it is not
6107,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"absolutely necessary here, I have omitted it; a definition being the"
6108,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"most perfect the fewer particulars you make use of, provided you can say"
6109,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,with certainty from those particulars the object so characterized must
6110,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,be this and no other whatever.
6111,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6112,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ But, papa, if I had never seen a horse, I should not know what"
6113,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,kind of animal it was by this definition.
6114,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6115,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ Let us hear, then, how you would give me an idea of a horse."
6116,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6117,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ I would say it was a fine large prancing creature with slender
6118,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"legs and an arched neck, and a sleek, smooth skin, and a tail that"
6119,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"sweeps the ground, and that he snorts and neighs very loud, and tosses"
6120,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"his head, and runs as swift as the wind."
6121,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6122,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ I think you learned some verses upon the horse in your last
6123,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,lesson? Repeat them.

6125,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._

6135,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6136,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Fa._ You have said very well; but this is not a _definition_, it is a"
6137,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_description_.
6138,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6139,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Ch._ What is the difference?
6140,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6141,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ A description is intended to give you a lively picture of an
6142,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"object, as if you saw it; it ought to be very full. A definition gives"
6143,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,no picture to those who have not seen it: it rather tells you what its
6144,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"subject is not, than what it is, by giving you such clear specific"
6145,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"marks, that it shall not be possible to confound it with anything else;"
6146,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,and hence it is of the greatest use in throwing things into classes. We
6147,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,have a great many beautiful descriptions from ancient authors so loosely
6148,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,worded that we cannot certainly tell what animals are meant by them:
6149,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"whereas, if they had given us definitions, three lines would have"
6150,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,ascertained their meaning.
6151,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6152,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"_Ch._ I like a description best, papa."
6153,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,
6154,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,_Fa._ Perhaps so; I believe I should have done the same at your age.
6155,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"Remember, however, that nothing is more useful than to learn to form"
6156,A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.,"ideas with precision, and to express them with accuracy; I have not"

6166,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"A Phenix, who had long inhabited the solitary deserts of Arabia, once"

6169,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"young ones, while she expected her mate, who was foraging abroad to"

6172,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"sunk in domestic cares, thou art continually employed either in laying"

6181,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"my care, springs up from my ashes. I am an image of the great sun whom I"
6182,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"adore; and glory in being like him, single and alone, and having no"
6183,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,likeness.”
6184,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,
6185,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"The dove replied, “O, phenix, I pity thee much more than thou affectest"
6186,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"to pity me! What pleasure canst thou enjoy, who livest forlorn and"
6187,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,solitary in a trackless and unpeopled desert? who hast no mate to caress
6188,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"thee, no young ones to excite thy tenderness and reward thy cares, no"
6189,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"kindred, no society among thy fellows? Not long life only, but"
6190,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"immortality itself would be a curse, if it were to be bestowed on such"
6191,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"uncomfortable terms. For my part, I know that my life will be short, and"
6192,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"therefore I employ it in raising a numerous posterity, and in opening my"
6193,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,heart to all the sweets of domestic happiness. I am beloved by my
6194,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,partner; I am dear to man; and shall leave marks behind me that I have
6195,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"lived. As to the sun, to whom thou hast presumed to compare thyself,"
6196,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"that glorious being is so totally different from, and so infinitely"
6197,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"superior to, all the creatures upon earth, that it does not become us to"
6198,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"liken ourselves to him, or to determine upon the manner of his"
6199,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"existence. One obvious difference, however, thou mayest remark; that the"
6200,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"sun, though alone, by his prolific heat produces all things, and though"
6201,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"he shines so high above our heads, gives us reason every moment to bless"
6202,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"his beams; whereas thou, swelling with imaginary greatness, dreamest"
6203,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,"away a long period of existence, equally void of comfort and of"
6204,THE PHENIX AND DOVE.,usefulness.”

6210,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6211,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6212,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Father._ I will now, as I promised, give you an account of the elegant"
6213,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"and useful manufacture of _paper_, the basis of which is itself a"
6214,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,manufacture. This delicate and beautiful substance is made from the
6215,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"meanest and most disgusting materials, from old rags, which have passed"
6216,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"from one poor person to another, and have perhaps at length dropped in"
6217,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,tatters from the child of the beggar. These are carefully picked up from
6218,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"dunghills, or bought from servants by Jews, who make it their business"
6219,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"to go about and collect them. They sell them to the rag-merchant, who"
6220,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"gives them from two pence to four pence a pound, according to their"
6221,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"quality; and he, when he has got a sufficient quantity, disposes of them"
6222,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,to the owner of the papermill. He gives them first to women to sort and
6223,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"pick, agreeably to their different degrees of fineness; they also with a"
6224,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"knife cut out carefully all the seams, which they throw into a basket"
6225,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"for other purposes; they then put them into the dusting-engine, a large"
6226,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"circular wire sieve, where they receive some degree of cleansing. The"
6227,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,rags are then conveyed to the mill. Here they were formerly beat to
6228,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"pieces with vast hammers, which rose and fell continually with a most"
6229,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"tremendous noise, that was heard at a great distance. But now they put"
6230,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the rags into a large trough or cistern, into which a pipe of clear"
6231,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,spring water is constantly flowing. In this cistern is placed a
6232,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"cylinder, about two feet long, set thick round with rows of iron spikes,"
6233,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,standing as near as they can to one another without touching. At the
6234,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,bottom of the trough there are corresponding rows of spikes. The
6235,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"cylinder is made to whirl round with inconceivable rapidity, and with"
6236,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,these iron teeth rends and tears the cloth in every possible direction;
6237,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"till, by the assistance of the water, which continually flows through"
6238,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the cistern, it is thoroughly masticated, and reduced to a fine pulp;"
6239,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"and by the same process all its impurities are cleansed away, and it is"
6240,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,restored to its original whiteness. This process takes about six hours.
6241,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"To improve the colour they then put in a little smalt, which gives it a"
6242,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"bluish cast, which all paper has more or less: the French paper has less"
6243,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,of it than ours. This fine pulp is next put into a copper of warm water.
6244,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"It is the substance of paper, but the form must now be given it: for"
6245,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"this purpose they use a mould. It is made of wire, strong one way, and"
6246,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,crossed with finer. This mould they just dip horizontally into the
6247,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"copper and take it out again. It has a little wooden frame on the edge,"
6248,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,by means of which it retains as much of the pulp as is wanted for the
6249,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"thickness of the sheet, and the water runs off through the interstices"
6250,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"of the wires. Another man instantly receives it, opens the frame, and"
6251,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"turns out the thin sheet, which has now shape, but not consistence, upon"
6252,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"soft felt, which is placed on the ground to receive it. On that is"
6253,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"placed another piece of felt, and then another sheet of paper, and so"
6254,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"on, till they have made a pile of forty or fifty. They are then pressed"
6255,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"with a large screw-press, moved by a long lever, which forcibly squeezes"
6256,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the water out of them, and gives them immediate consistence. There is"
6257,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"still, however, a great deal to be done. The felts are taken off, and"
6258,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"thrown on one side, and the paper on the other, whence it is dexterously"
6259,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"taken up with an instrument in the form of a T, three sheets at a time,"
6260,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"and hung on lines to dry. There it hangs for a week or ten days, which"
6261,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,likewise further whitens it; and any knots and roughness it may have are
6262,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,picked off carefully by the women. It is then sized. Size is a kind of
6263,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,glue; and without this preparation the paper would not bear ink; it
6264,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,would run and blot as you see it does on gray paper. The sheets are just
6265,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,dipped into the size and taken out again. The exact degree of sizing is
6266,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"a matter of nicety, which can only be known by experience. They are then"
6267,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"hung up again to dry, and when dry, taken to the finishing-room, where"
6268,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"they are examined anew, pressed in the dry-presses, which give them"
6269,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"their last gloss and smoothness; counted up into quires, made up into"
6270,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"reams, and sent to the stationer’s, from whom we have it, after he has"
6271,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,folded it again and cut the edges; some too he makes to shine like
6272,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"satin, by hot-pressing it, or glossing it with hot plates. The whole"
6273,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,process of papermaking takes about three weeks.
6274,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6275,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Har._ It is a very curious process indeed. I shall almost scruple for
6276,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the future to blacken a sheet of paper with a careless scrawl, now I"
6277,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,know how much pains it costs to make it so white and beautiful.
6278,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6279,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Fa._ It is true that there is hardly anything we use with so much waste
6280,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,and profusion as this manufacture: we should think ourselves confined in
6281,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the use of it, if we might not tear, disperse, and destroy it in a"
6282,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,thousand ways; so that it is really astonishing whence linen enough can
6283,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"be procured to answer so vast a demand. As to the coarse brown papers,"
6284,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,of which an astonishing quantity is used by every shopkeeper in
6285,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"packages, &c., these are made chiefly of oakum, that is, old hempen"
6286,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,ropes. A fine paper is made in China of silk.
6287,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6288,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Har._ I have heard lately of woven paper; pray, what is that? they"
6289,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"cannot weave paper, surely!"
6290,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6291,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Fa._ Your question is very natural. In order to answer it, I must"
6292,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"desire you to take a sheet of common paper, and hold it up against the"
6293,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,light. Do not you see marks in it?
6294,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6295,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Har._ I see a great many white lines running along lengthwise, like"
6296,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"ribs, and smaller that cross them. I see, too, letters and the figure of"
6297,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,a crown.
6298,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6299,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Fa._ These are all the marks of the wires; the thickness of the wire
6300,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"prevents so much of the pulp lying upon the sheet in those places,"
6301,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"consequently wherever the wires are the paper is thinner, and you see"
6302,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"the light through more readily, which gives that appearance of white"
6303,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"lines. The letters, too, are worked in the wire, and are the maker’s"
6304,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"name. Now, to prevent these lines, which take off from the beauty of the"
6305,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"paper, particularly of drawing-paper, there have been lately used moulds"
6306,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"of brass wire, exceeding fine, of equal thickness, and woven or latticed"
6307,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"one within another: the marks therefore of these are easily pressed out,"
6308,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,so as to be hardly visible; if you look at this sheet you will see it is
6309,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,quite smooth.
6310,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6311,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Har._ It is so.
6312,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6313,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Fa._ I should mention to you, that there is a discovery very lately"
6314,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"made, by which they can make paper equal to any in whiteness, of the"
6315,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"coarsest brown rags, and even of died cotton; which they have till now"
6316,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,been obliged to throw by for inferior purposes.
6317,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6318,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Har._ That is like what you told me before of bleaching cloth in a few
6319,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,hours.
6320,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6321,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Fa._ It is indeed founded upon the same discovery. The paper made of
6322,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"these brown rags is likewise more valuable, from being very tough and"
6323,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"strong, almost like parchment."
6324,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6325,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,_Har._ When was the making of paper found out?
6326,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,
6327,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"_Fa._ It is a disputed point, but probably in the fourteenth century."
6328,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,The invention has been of almost equal consequence to literature with
6329,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"that of printing itself; and shows how the arts and sciences, like"
6330,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,"children of the same family, mutually assist and bring forward each"
6331,THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.,other.

6339,THE TWO ROBBERS.,Scene—_Alexander the Great in his tent. Guards. A man with a fierce
6340,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"countenance, chained and fettered, brought before him._"
6341,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6342,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_Alex._ What, art thou the Thracian robber of whose exploits I have"
6343,THE TWO ROBBERS.,heard so much?
6344,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6345,THE TWO ROBBERS.,_Rob._ I am a Thracian and a soldier.
6346,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6347,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ A soldier!—a thief, a plunderer, an assassin! the pest of the"
6348,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"country! could honour thy courage, but I must detest and punish thy"
6349,THE TWO ROBBERS.,crimes.
6350,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6351,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_R._ What have I done, of which _you_ can complain?"
6352,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6353,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ Hast thou not set at defiance my authority, violated the public"
6354,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"peace, and passed thy life in injuring the persons and properties of thy"
6355,THE TWO ROBBERS.,fellow-subjects?
6356,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6357,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_R._ Alexander, I am your captive—I must hear what you please to say,"
6358,THE TWO ROBBERS.,and endure what you please to inflict. But my soul is unconquered; and
6359,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"if I reply at all to your reproaches, I will reply like a free man."
6360,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6361,THE TWO ROBBERS.,_A._ Speak freely. Far be it from me to take the advantage of my power
6362,THE TWO ROBBERS.,to silence those with whom I deign to converse!
6363,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6364,THE TWO ROBBERS.,_R._ I must then answer your question by another. How have _you_ passed
6365,THE TWO ROBBERS.,your life?
6366,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6367,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ Like a hero. Ask Fame and she will tell you. Among the brave, I"
6368,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"have been the bravest; among sovereigns, the noblest; among conquerors,"
6369,THE TWO ROBBERS.,the mightiest.
6370,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6371,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_R._ And does not fame speak of me, too? Was there ever a bolder captain"
6372,THE TWO ROBBERS.,of a more valiant band? Was there ever—but I scorn to boast. You
6373,THE TWO ROBBERS.,yourself know that I have not been easily subdued.
6374,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6375,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ Still, what are you but a robber—a base dishonest robber?"
6376,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6377,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_R._ And what is a conqueror? Have not you, too, gone about the earth"
6378,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"like an evil genius, blasting the fair fruits of peace and"
6379,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"industry;—plundering, ravaging, killing without law, without justice,"
6380,THE TWO ROBBERS.,merely to gratify an insatiable lust for dominion? All that I have done
6381,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"to a single district with a hundred followers, you have done to whole"
6382,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"nations with a hundred thousand. If I have stripped individuals, you"
6383,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"have ruined kings and princes. If I have burnt a few hamlets, you have"
6384,THE TWO ROBBERS.,desolated the most flourishing kingdoms and cities of the earth. What is
6385,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"then the difference, but that as you were born a king, and I a private"
6386,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"man, you have been able to become a mightier robber than I?"
6387,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6388,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ But if I have taken like a king, I have given like a king. If I"
6389,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"have subverted empires, I have founded greater. I have cherished arts,"
6390,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"commerce, and philosophy."
6391,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6392,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_R._ I, too, have freely given to the poor what I took from the rich. I"
6393,THE TWO ROBBERS.,have established order and discipline among the most ferocious of
6394,THE TWO ROBBERS.,mankind; and have stretched out my protecting arm over the oppressed. I
6395,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"know, indeed, little of the philosophy you talk of; but I believe"
6396,THE TWO ROBBERS.,neither you nor I shall ever repay to the world the mischiefs we have
6397,THE TWO ROBBERS.,done it.
6398,THE TWO ROBBERS.,
6399,THE TWO ROBBERS.,"_A._ Leave me—take off his chains, and use him well. (_Exit robber._)"
6400,THE TWO ROBBERS.,Are we then so much alike?—Alexander to a robber?—Let me reflect.

6411,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6412,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6413,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"Among the large branches of an aged oak, which grew in the midst of a"
6414,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"thick wood, lived once upon a time a wildcat. In that tree she was born"
6415,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and brought up, and had nursed many litters of kittens; her mother and"
6416,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"her grandmother, had lived there before her; indeed, I believe that, as"
6417,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"long as the oak had been an oak, this family of wildcats had made it"
6418,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,their home.
6419,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6420,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"One day, as she was couching among some bushes near the foot of her"
6421,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"tree, watching her opportunity to spring upon any poor little bird who"
6422,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"might happen to alight within her reach, she heard a great rustling in"
6423,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the thicket, and presently two men pushed their way through, and stood"
6424,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"before her. This part of the forest was so tangled and wild, and so far"
6425,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"from any human habitation, that it was a rare thing to see men there,"
6426,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,and the cat wondered very much why they came; so she lay quite still in
6427,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"her hiding-place, watching them and listening to hear what they should"
6428,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"say. She soon discovered that they were woodcutters, for each was armed"
6429,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"with an axe, which he carried upon his shoulder."
6430,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6431,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"Presently one said to his fellow, “Is it all to be cut down?”—“All the"
6432,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"whole forest,” answered the other, “and the ground is to be ploughed up"
6433,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and sown with corn, but the largest trees are to be felled first.”—“If"
6434,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"that be the case,” said the first, “we cannot begin better than with"
6435,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"this noble oak before us, and I will put a mark on it that we may know"
6436,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"it again.” So saying, he pulled out a piece of chalk, and made a large"
6437,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"white cross on the bark of the poor cat’s own tree. “Next week,” added"
6438,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"he, “we will lay the axe to the root.” And he walked on, whistling with"
6439,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,great unconcern.
6440,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6441,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"The unfortunate cat lay a long time on the ground, half dead with grief"
6442,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and terror, and unable to move a limb. At length, after uttering several"
6443,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"cries so loud and shrill that the whole forest seemed to ring again, she"
6444,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"started up, and ran like one distracted to spread the dismal news among"
6445,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,her neighbours of the wood. The first creature that she met was the
6446,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"stag: he had just started up from his lair, amid the thickest cover, and"
6447,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"stood listening, ready to bound away on the first appearance of danger."
6448,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“Was it you, neighbour puss,” cried he, “who set up that frightful yell"
6449,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,which I heard? I almost thought the hounds and hunters were upon me;—but
6450,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"what is the matter?”—“Matter enough,” answered the cat; “worse than"
6451,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,either hounds or hunters; the forest is to be cut down.” And she told
6452,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"him her sad story. “The forest cut down!” brayed out the poor stag,"
6453,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,while the tears ran in large drops down his hairy face; “and what is to
6454,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"become of me and you, and all our neighbours? Man has always been my"
6455,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"enemy, but this is a stroke of cruelty which I did not expect even from"
6456,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"him. Is there no help, no remedy?”—“I will fight for my tree,” cried the"
6457,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"cat, “as long as teeth and claws hold good: and you with your great"
6458,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,horns may surely defend your own thicket; but this _man_ is a terrible
6459,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"creature, and he has so many crafty tricks, that I know nobody, except"
6460,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the fox, who is at all a match for him; suppose we run and ask his"
6461,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"advice.” “With all my heart,” said the stag; and they marched away"
6462,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,together in search of him.
6463,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6464,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"The fox had his abode near the skirts of the forest, in the middle of a"
6465,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"dry bank, thickly covered with bushes and brambles. His hole was"
6466,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"burrowed deep into the earth, and cunningly contrived with several"
6467,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"openings on different sides, by which he might make his escape in case"
6468,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"of danger. The cat put her head in at one of the entrances, and called"
6469,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"to him to come out; but it was not till he had carefully peeped about,"
6470,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and thoroughly satisfied himself that all was safe, that cunning Reynard"
6471,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,ventured to trust himself abroad.
6472,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6473,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,In great distress the stag related the cause of their coming. “I have
6474,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"heard something of this matter before,” replied the fox; “but you are"
6475,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,too condescending to come and ask the advice of a simple creature like
6476,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"myself, who never yet knew what policy or artifice meant, and—.” Here"
6477,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the cat and the stag eagerly interrupted him, and with one voice began"
6478,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,to compliment him on the sagacity and wisdom for which all the world
6479,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"gave him credit, declaring that their whole hope and consolation rested"
6480,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"on his counsels. “Well,” returned the fox, “since you will have it so,"
6481,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,though I blush to utter my poor thoughts before beasts so much my
6482,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"superiors, I will venture with all humility to suggest, that a general"
6483,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"meeting be immediately summoned of all the animals of the forest, in"
6484,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"order that we may take our measures in concert, and after hearing the"
6485,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,opinions of all.”
6486,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6487,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,“An excellent proposal!” cried the stag. “An excellent proposal!” echoed
6488,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,the cat; “but who shall we send to call them all together?”—“I would go
6489,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"to them myself,” replied the fox, “but it is possible that some of the"
6490,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"smaller animals might doubt the innocence of my intentions, and refuse"
6491,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,to come; for I have been a much calumniated creature. The same thing
6492,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"might happen with you, neighbour Puss; the squirrel and the mouse"
6493,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"especially....” “True,” cried the cat, “they would, perhaps, be taking"
6494,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"some idle notions into their heads....” “And as to my lord the stag,”"
6495,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"rejoined Reynard, “he is a beast of far too exalted a rank for such an"
6496,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"office. Stay, there is my worthy friend the hedgehog, suppose we send"
6497,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"him; a little slow of foot, to be sure, and not wonderfully bright; but"
6498,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"a plain honest creature as any that lives, well spoken of throughout the"
6499,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"forest, and the enemy of no one, except indeed of the flies and the"
6500,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"beetles; but we do not call the insects to council, of course.”—“Of"
6501,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"course,” rejoined the cat; “but what shall we say to the"
6502,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"reptiles?”—“Why, as to my neighbour the viper,” returned the fox, “I own"
6503,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"I am inclined to think favourably of him, whatever some may whisper to"
6504,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"his disadvantage; his temper indeed may be none of the mildest, but he"
6505,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"knows how to make himself respected, and I think we must by no means"
6506,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"leave him out; and if he is admitted, in common civility his cousin the"
6507,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"snake must be invited also.”—“And what say you to the toad, the frog,"
6508,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and the newt?” asked the stag. “Poor creatures,” said the fox with a"
6509,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"sneer, “your lordship is certainly very condescending to remember the"
6510,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"existence of beings so inferior. They sit in our council, truly!"
6511,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"However, I would by no means give offence, at a time like this, even to"
6512,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the meanest—they may be permitted to hear the debate, provided they do"
6513,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,not presume to speak among their betters.”
6514,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6515,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,The fox now called in a somewhat imperious tone to the hedgehog to come
6516,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"forth. At the sound of his voice, the little creature roused himself"
6517,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"with some difficulty from his morning’s nap, and hastily unrolling"
6518,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,himself and clearing his prickly coat from the grass and dead leaves
6519,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"that stuck in it, and added not a little to his rude, slovenly"
6520,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"appearance, he crept out from his hole under the roots of a tree, and"
6521,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,inquired with much humility what Mr. Reynard wanted with him. The fox
6522,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"explained in few words the alarming occurrence of the morning, and thus"
6523,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,proceeded to give the hedgehog his orders:—
6524,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6525,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“You are to summon all our good neighbours to meet this evening, an hour"
6526,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"before sunset, under the great yew-tree that stands by itself near the"
6527,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"centre of the wood. Please to attend, and I will name them to you in"
6528,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"their order, that you may make no mistakes. First, you turn down into"
6529,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"yonder dingle, and there, just beyond the old poplar which is blown up"
6530,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"by the roots and lies across the way, look very sharp, and in a snug"
6531,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,sheltered nook you will spy a hole running down into the steep bank; at
6532,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,the bottom of it you will find the badger. Beg him to come without fail;
6533,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,excepting the present company there is no animal in the forest of
6534,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"greater size and consequence, nor whom I respect more. A little lower"
6535,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"down, on the very brink of the stream, lives my cousin the polecat;—a"
6536,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"damp situation, I should think, but they say he sometimes amuses himself"
6537,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,with fishing. He is a sharp fellow; we must by all means have him at our
6538,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,council.
6539,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6540,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“The weasel comes next, and you will find him in a hollow tree not far"
6541,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,off. If the squirrel be not frolicking as usual among the boughs of the
6542,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"large beech in which he has his nest, nuts are now ripe, and you must"
6543,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"look for him in the hazel-copse on the left. If I do not mistake, you"
6544,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,will also find the dormouse lodged under the roots of that large oak
6545,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,hard by which is so full of acorns; and the woodmouse is his next-door
6546,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,neighbour.
6547,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6548,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“You must then turn off toward the edge of the forest, and search among"
6549,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,the fern-brakes till you find the hare; she sits close in her form all
6550,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,day. Assure her that we are extremely desirous of her company; and if
6551,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"she, or any other of our good neighbours, should make the smallest"
6552,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"scruple of meeting puss or myself, be sure to mention that my lord the"
6553,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"stag passes his word for their safety, both coming and returning. The"
6554,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,snake will probably be sunning himself on the grass a little lower down;
6555,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and in the dry part of the wood above, if you look narrowly, you will"
6556,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,spy the viper lurking among the dead leaves. And now you may be gone.”
6557,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6558,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,The hedgehog trudged off with his commission.
6559,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6560,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,In the evening every one of the animals made his appearance under the
6561,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"yew-tree, except the little lazy dormouse, who had just opened his eyes"
6562,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"when the hedgehog delivered his message, then turned himself round,"
6563,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"fallen asleep again, and forgotten the whole matter."
6564,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6565,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"As undoubted lord of the forest, the stag took the upper place; puss"
6566,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"seated herself on his right, and Reynard on his left; the others placed"
6567,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,themselves in due order below. The stag opened the business of the day
6568,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,by calling upon the cat to relate what she had that morning seen and
6569,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"heard. Immediately, the afflicted creature yelled out her dismal tale,"
6570,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,ending with a long and melancholy mew which was echoed by every animal
6571,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"present in his own note; the stag brayed, the fox howled, the polecat"
6572,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and weasel cried, the badger and squirrel growled, the snake and viper"
6573,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"hissed, the hare screamed, and the mouse squeaked. When the din of these"
6574,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"discordant noises had a little subsided, “My friends,” said the stag,"
6575,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“lamentations are in vain, let us now consider what is to be done; shall"
6576,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,we look on in tame submission to see our native wood levelled with the
6577,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"earth, and ourselves turned out upon the wide world to seek for food and"
6578,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"shelter wherever we may find them, or shall we not rather all join to"
6579,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,defend it with such weapons as nature has given us? Let the cat speak
6580,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,first.”
6581,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6582,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“I am for open war,” cried puss; “these teeth and these talons were not"
6583,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,bestowed upon me for nothing;” (and as she spoke she unsheathed a set of
6584,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,claws at sight of which the mouse and the squirrel trembled all over.)
6585,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,“The first man who attacks my tree shall feel them in his eyes; I will
6586,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,defend my native home as long as I have breath in my body. Who is of the
6587,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,same mind?”
6588,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6589,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“Reynard, let us hear your opinion,” said the stag. “I beg to speak"
6590,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"last,” said the crafty fox; “perhaps I have not yet made up my opinion.”"
6591,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6592,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“For my part,” growled out the badger, thrusting forward his clumsy"
6593,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"person as he spoke, “I am not so cunning as some folks; I speak my mind"
6594,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,and care for nobody; and I have only this to say—that I never attack
6595,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"first, but I have strong teeth and a tough hide; and if anybody attempts"
6596,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"to turn me out of my den, whether man, dog, or any other beast, I shall"
6597,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,try to make him repent it.”
6598,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6599,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"It was observed that the badger, as he spoke, threw a sullen look at the"
6600,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"fox, which plainly showed that he had not forgotten the knavish trick by"
6601,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,which Reynard had once contrived to turn him out of a hole which he had
6602,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"dug with the labours of his own claws, and to keep possession of it for"
6603,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,himself.
6604,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6605,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"The viper now glided forward in easy curves, and coiling himself up, and"
6606,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"darting out his forked tongue in a threatening attitude, “Man,” said he,"
6607,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“is my enemy, and I am his; let him set foot in my dominions if he"
6608,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,dares; I have a venom in my fangs which will soon teach him that my
6609,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,anger is not to be despised.”
6610,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6611,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“I,” murmured out the snake, “have no venom to boast; I am an innocent"
6612,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and defenceless creature, and I own that so far from attempting to"
6613,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"resist the invader, I shall quickly retreat from his approach. Nature,"
6614,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"in her bounty, has endued me with the power of swimming; and when I can"
6615,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"no longer find a shelter beneath these quiet shades, I shall plunge into"
6616,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the stream which bounds our domain, and seek a safer retreat among the"
6617,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,tall weeds which flourish on its farther shore.”
6618,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6619,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“As for me,” feebly screamed out the hare, as she limped forth, staring"
6620,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"around her with a look of affright, “all the world must be aware how"
6621,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,weak and timid a creature I am. It has been said that I have many
6622,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"friends, but I have never yet found a protector, and cruel and powerful"
6623,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,enemies lie in wait for my harmless life on every side. What will become
6624,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"of me I know not, probably some evil end awaits me; but I shall use"
6625,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"these nimble legs, my only hope of safety, to bear me far away from the"
6626,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,dreadful sight of man.”
6627,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6628,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"The sprightly squirrel came forward with a bound. “I have teeth,” cried"
6629,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"he, “very able to crack a nut, and claws by which I can cling fast"
6630,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"enough to a bough, but how am I to contend against the mighty power of"
6631,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,man? He would twist off my poor little head before I could draw one drop
6632,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"of blood from his finger. It is true that I can live only in trees, and"
6633,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,one might as well die fighting as pine away with misery and hunger; but
6634,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"I have better things in view than either. From the summit of my beech, I"
6635,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"have often observed, at some distance on the farther side of the river,"
6636,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"a group of noble chestnuts growing in a park, which would supply me both"
6637,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,with food and lodging. I have also discovered a spot where two trees on
6638,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"opposite sides of the stream stretch forth their arms, and nearly meet"
6639,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,above:—I have made up my mind to the adventure; one bold leap will bear
6640,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"me safely, I hope, to the farther shore, and the new and beautiful"
6641,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,country that lies beyond it.”
6642,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6643,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“I believe,” squeaked a small shrill voice which was found to proceed"
6644,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"from the mouse, “that my services would be of small importance in a war"
6645,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"against mankind; and I do not offer them. To say the truth, I find"
6646,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"myself, on second thoughts, not greatly concerned in this affair. If I"
6647,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"lose my nuts and acorns by the fall of the trees, I shall get wheat,"
6648,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"barley, and oats, in exchange, which are not worse eating, and I can"
6649,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,lodge full as well in the middle of a corn-rick as under the roots of a
6650,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,tree.—Every one for himself in this world.”
6651,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6652,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“Our little friend is much in the right,” cried the weasel; “I really"
6653,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,believe that we shall find vastly comfortable lodging about barns and
6654,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"farmhouses, and the very thought of a poultry-yard makes my mouth water:"
6655,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,for such an exchange I should not object to giving up my quarters in the
6656,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"wood to-morrow.”—“Nor I, I protest,” exclaimed the polecat. “Hens’ eggs"
6657,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"are not bad things, and how delicious to fatten on the blood of turkeys,"
6658,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"geese, and chickens! A forest is not absolutely necessary to me; I can"
6659,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"hide myself well enough in a hedge, or under a ditch-bank.”"
6660,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6661,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“Reynard,” said the stag, “all have spoken now but you, and we are"
6662,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,impatient for your opinion.”
6663,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6664,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"The fox arose, cast his eyes on the ground with an air of great modesty,"
6665,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and after pausing a few moments, as if to gain courage to speak, he thus"
6666,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"began, gracefully waving his long bushy tail as he spoke:—“While I"
6667,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"listened to the warlike eloquence of the cat, to the indignant harangue"
6668,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"of the viper, and to the resolute speech of my worthy friend, the"
6669,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"badger, I. like them, felt myself inspired with the valiant resolution"
6670,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"to die in defence of our native wood, and in open war with man. But when"
6671,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"I afterward began to consider the weakness of our lesser brethren, the"
6672,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"smallness of our numbers, and the wonderful power and resources of man,"
6673,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"I was induced to change my opinion. We cannot hope for victory, why"
6674,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"should we throw away our lives? The viper, in spite of his courage and"
6675,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"his venom, would be caught by the neck in a cleft stick, and put"
6676,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,ingloriously to death very likely before he had been able to inflict a
6677,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,single bite. The badger is a favourite object of the cruelty of man; he
6678,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"would set upon him his whole troop of dogs, hateful brutes, who are"
6679,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,always joined in league with him against their fellow beasts!—and though
6680,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"my worthy friend would fight like a hero, and kill or maim several of"
6681,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"them, he would at length be torn in pieces. Of what avail would be the"
6682,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,teeth and claws of the cat against that thunder and lightning by which
6683,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,man has the art of killing from afar? She would be brought down from her
6684,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"highest bough pierced through the head or the heart, before she could"
6685,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,even see that enemy whose eyes she threatens to tear out with her
6686,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"talons. Even you yourself, my lord stag, would assuredly fall by the"
6687,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,teeth of those detestable hounds after you had gored three or four of
6688,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,the pack. I therefore propose more cautious measures. Not far off is a
6689,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"wide unfrequented common, where the badger may dig himself a den and"
6690,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"remain at peace, and where the viper may glide undisturbed among the"
6691,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,heath and gorse. I have scarcely given a thought to the humble concerns
6692,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,of my insignificant self; but perhaps I too may find some cover in that
6693,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"neglected tract, which abounds also in wild rabbits. For you, my lord"
6694,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"stag, you have only to swim the stream to find yourself, like the"
6695,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"squirrel, in a noble park where man himself would be proud to become"
6696,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"your protector, and own you for the noblest ornament of his domain. And"
6697,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,why should not puss offer her services to hunt the mice and rats at some
6698,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,snug farmhouse in the neighbourhood?”
6699,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,
6700,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“I!” interrupted puss, setting up her back and swelling in sudden anger,"
6701,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"“I become a fawning menial in the dwellings of man, like those miserable"
6702,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"little foreigners who have sometimes appeared in my sight, and whom I am"
6703,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"ashamed to own for cats! No, I am a beast of prey, a free native of the"
6704,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"English woods, and such I will live and die. Man may hunt me down, he"
6705,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"may destroy my whole race, as he has already hunted down and destroyed"
6706,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"the bear and the wolf, animals much my superiors in size and in"
6707,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"strength; but I disdain to become his household servant, or to skulk,"
6708,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"like some of vermin breed, about his outhouses, and poultry-yards,"
6709,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"picking up a base living by theft and rapine. And you, Reynard, crafty"
6710,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"knave as you are, do you think I do not see through your tricks and your"
6711,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"pretences? You too, like the weasel and polecat, have an eye on the"
6712,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"poultry-yard and the sheepfold; you live by man though he hates you, and"
6713,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"endeavours to destroy you, and you care not what becomes of the lives or"
6714,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"liberty of nobler animals: but I will reach _your_ eyes at least, and"
6715,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"teach you what it is to provoke me.” So saying, she flew at him in a"
6716,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"fury: her first attack brought him to the ground, and he was almost"
6717,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,blinded before he could strike a blow in his own defence. The polecat
6718,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"and weasel, thinking their turns would come next, slunk away; the hare"
6719,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,and the smaller animals followed their example; even the stag himself
6720,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,was seized with a panic and fled. The badger alone stood and looked on
6721,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"with great composure at the distress of Reynard. At length, the fox,"
6722,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"seeing puss almost out of breath, made a desperate effort and broke"
6723,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"loose from her clutches. With his usual cunning he ran toward the river,"
6724,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,well knowing that the cat would not wet her feet. He plunged into the
6725,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"water before she could overtake him, and swimming with some difficulty"
6726,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,"to the opposite side, threw himself on the bank half dead with pain and"
6727,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,fright. Puss returned to her tree disappointed and sullen; and thus
6728,THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.,unprofitably ended the Council of Quadrupeds.

6819,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6820,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6821,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"George and Harry, accompanied by their tutor, went one day to pay a"
6822,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"visit to a neighbouring gentleman, their father’s friend. They were very"
6823,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"kindly received, and shown all about the gardens and pleasure-grounds;"
6824,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"but nothing took their fancy so much as an extensive grapery, hung round"
6825,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"with bunches of various kinds fully ripe, and almost too big for the"
6826,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"vines to support. They were liberally treated with the fruit, and"
6827,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"carried away some bunches to eat as they walked. During their return, as"
6828,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"they were picking their grapes, George said to the tutor, “A thought is"
6829,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"just come into my head, sir. Wine, you know is called the juice of the"
6830,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"grape; but wine is hot, and intoxicates people that drink much of it."
6831,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"Now we have had a good deal of grape-juice this morning, and yet I do"
6832,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"not feel heated, nor does it seem at all to have got into our heads."
6833,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,What is the reason of this?”
6834,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6835,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ The reason is, that grape-juice is not wine, though wine is made"
6836,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,from it.
6837,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6838,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ Pray how is it made, then?"
6839,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6840,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ I will tell you; for it is a matter worth knowing. The juice
6841,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"pressed from the grapes, called _must_, is at first a sweet watery"
6842,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"liquor, with a little tartness, but with no strength or spirit. After it"
6843,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"has stood awhile, it begins to grow thick and muddy, it moves up and"
6844,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"down, and throws scum and bubbles of air to the surface. This is called"
6845,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_working_ or _fermenting_. It continues in this state for some time,"
6846,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"more or less, according to the quantity of the juice and the temperature"
6847,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"of the weather, and then gradually settles again, becoming clearer than"
6848,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"at first. It has now lost its sweet flat taste, and acquired a briskness"
6849,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"and pungency, with a heating and intoxicating property; that is, it has"
6850,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"become _wine_. This natural process is called the _vinous fermentation_,"
6851,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and many liquors besides grape-juice are capable of undergoing it.
6852,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6853,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ I have heard of the working of beer and ale. Is that of the same
6854,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,kind?
6855,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6856,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ It is: and beer and ale may properly be called barley-wine; for
6857,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"you know they are clear, brisk, and intoxicating. In the same manner,"
6858,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"cider is apple-wine, and mead is honey-wine; and you have heard of"
6859,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"raisin-wine and currant-wine, and a great many others."
6860,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6861,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Har._ Yes, there is elder-wine, and cowslip-wine and orange-wine."
6862,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6863,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ Will everything of that sort make wine?
6864,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6865,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ All vegetable juices that are sweet are capable of fermenting,"
6866,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and of producing a liquor of a vinous nature; but if they have little
6867,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"sweetness, the liquor is proportionally weak and poor, and is apt to"
6868,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,become sour or vapid.
6869,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6870,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ But barley is not sweet.
6871,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6872,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Barley as it comes from the ear is not; but before it is used for
6873,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"brewing, it is made into _malt_, and then it is sensibly sweet. You know"
6874,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,what malt is?
6875,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6876,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Har._ I have seen heaps of it in the malt-house, but I do not know how"
6877,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,it is made.
6878,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6879,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ Barley is made malt by putting it in heaps and wetting it, when"
6880,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"it becomes hot, and swells, and would sprout out just as if it were"
6881,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"sown, unless it were then dried in a kiln. By this operation it acquires"
6882,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,a sweet taste. You have drunk sweet-wort?
6883,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6884,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ Yes.
6885,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6886,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ Well, this is made by steeping malt in hot water. The water"
6887,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,extracts and dissolves all the sweet or sugary part of the malt. It then
6888,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,becomes like a naturally sweet juice.
6889,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6890,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ Would not sugar and water then make wine?
6891,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6892,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ It would; and the wines made in England of our common fruits and
6893,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"flowers have all a good deal of sugar in them. Cowslip flowers, for"
6894,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"example, give little more than the flavour to the wine named from them,"
6895,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and it is the sugar added to them which properly makes the wine.
6896,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6897,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ But none of these wines are so good as grape-wine?
6898,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6899,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ No. The grape, from the richness and abundance of its juice, is"
6900,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"the fruit universally preferred for making wine, where it comes to"
6901,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"perfection, which it seldom does in our climate, except by means of"
6902,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,artificial heat.
6903,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6904,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ I suppose, then, grapes are finest in the hottest countries?"
6905,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6906,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ Not so, neither; they are properly a fruit of the temperate zone,"
6907,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and do not grow well between the tropics. And in very hot countries it
6908,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"is scarcely possible to make wines of any kind to keep, for they ferment"
6909,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,so strongly as to turn sour almost immediately.
6910,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6911,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ I think I have read of palm-wine on the coast of Guinea.
6912,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6913,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Yes. A sweet juice flows abundantly from incisions in certain
6914,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"species of the palm; which ferments immediately, and makes a very"
6915,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,pleasant sort of weak wine. But it must be drunk the same day it is
6916,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"made, for on the next it is as sour as vinegar."
6917,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6918,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ What is vinegar—is it not sour wine?
6919,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6920,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Everything that makes wine will make vinegar also; and the
6921,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,stronger the wine the stronger the vinegar. The vinous fermentation must
6922,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"be first brought on, but it need not produce perfect wine, for when the"
6923,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"intention is to make vinegar, the liquor is kept still warm, and it goes"
6924,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"on without stopping to another kind of fermentation, called the"
6925,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_acetous_, the product of which is vinegar."
6926,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6927,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ I have heard of alegar. I suppose that is vinegar made of ale.
6928,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6929,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ It is—but as ale is not so strong as wine, the vinegar made from"
6930,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,it is not so sharp or perfect. But housewives make good vinegar with
6931,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,sugar and water.
6932,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6933,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ Will vinegar make people drunk if they take too much of it?
6934,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6935,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ No: the wine loses its intoxicating quality as well as its taste
6936,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,on turning to vinegar.
6937,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6938,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ What are spirituous liquors—have they not something to do with
6939,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,wine?
6940,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6941,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Yes: they consist of the spirituous or intoxicating part of wine
6942,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"separated from the rest. You may remember that, on talking of"
6943,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"distillation, I told you that it was the raising of a liquor in steam or"
6944,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"vapour, and condensing it again; and that some liquors were more easily"
6945,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"turned to vapour than others, and were therefore called more volatile or"
6946,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"evaporable. Now, wine is a mixed or compound liquor, of which the"
6947,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,greater part is water; but what heats and intoxicates is _vinous
6948,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"spirit_. This spirit being much more volatile than water, on the"
6949,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"application of a gentle heat, flies off in vapour, and may be collected"
6950,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,by itself in distilling vessels;—and thus are made spirituous liquors.
6951,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6952,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ Will everything that you called wine yield spirits?
6953,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6954,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ Yes: everything that has undergone the vinous fermentation. Thus,"
6955,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,in England a great deal of malt spirit is made from a kind of wort
6956,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"brought into fermentation, and then set directly to distil, without"
6957,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,first making ale or beer of it. Gin is a spirituous liquor also got from
6958,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"corn, and flavoured with juniper berries. Even potatoes, carrots, and"
6959,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"turnips, may be made to afford spirits, by first fermenting their"
6960,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"juices. In the West Indies, rum is distilled from the dregs of the"
6961,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"sugarcanes, washed out by water and fermented. But brandy is distilled"
6962,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"from the fermented juice of the grape, and is made in the wine"
6963,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,countries.
6964,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6965,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ Is spirit of wine different from spirituous liquors?
6966,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6967,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ It is the strongest part of them got by distilling over again;
6968,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"for all these still contain a good deal of water, along with a pure"
6969,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"spirit, which may be separated by a gentler heat than was used at first."
6970,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"But in order to procure this as strong and pure as possible, it must be"
6971,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"distilled several times over, always leaving some of the watery part"
6972,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"behind. When perfectly pure, it is the same, whatever spirituous liquor"
6973,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,it is got from.
6974,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6975,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ My mamma has little bottles of lavender water. What is that?
6976,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6977,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ It is a spirit of wine flavoured with lavender flowers; and it
6978,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"may in like manner be flavoured with many other fragrant things, since"
6979,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"their odoriferous part is volatile, and will rise in vapour along with"
6980,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,the spirit.
6981,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6982,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ Will not spirit of wine burn violently?
6983,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6984,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ That it will, I can tell you: and so will rum and brandy; for you"
6985,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,know it was set on fire when we made snap-dragon.
6986,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6987,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ All spirituous liquors are highly inflammable, and the more so"
6988,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,the purer they are. One way of trying the purity of spirit is to see if
6989,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,it will burn all away without leaving any moisture behind. Then it is
6990,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"much lighter than water, and that affords another way of judging of its"
6991,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,strength. A hollow ivory ball is set to swim in it; and the deeper it
6992,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"sinks down, the lighter, and therefore the more spirituous, is the"
6993,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,liquor.
6994,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6995,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ I have heard much of the mischief done by spirituous liquors—pray
6996,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,what good do they do?
6997,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
6998,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ The use and abuse of wine and spirits is a very copious subject;
6999,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"and there is scarcely any gift of human art, the general effects of"
7000,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,which are more dubious. You know what wine is said to be given for in
7001,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,the Bible?
7002,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7003,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ To make glad the heart of man.
7004,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7005,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Right. And nothing has such an immediate effect in inspiring
7006,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"vigour of body and mind as wine. It banishes sorrow and care, recruits"
7007,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"from fatigue, enlivens the fancy, inflames the courage, and performs a"
7008,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"hundred fine things, of which I could bring you abundant proof from the"
7009,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"poets. The physicians, too, speak almost as much in its favour, both in"
7010,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,diet and medicine. But its really good effects are only when used in
7011,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,moderation; and it unfortunately is one of those things which man can
7012,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,hardly be brought to use moderately. Excess in wine brings on effects
7013,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"the very contrary to its benefits. It stupifies and enfeebles the mind,"
7014,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and fills the body with incurable diseases. And this it does even when
7015,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,used without intoxication. But a drunken man loses for the time every
7016,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"distinction of a reasonable creature, and becomes worse than a brute"
7017,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,beast. On this account Mahomet entirely forbade its use to his
7018,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"followers, and to this day it is not publicly drunk in any of the"
7019,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,countries that receive the Mohammedan religion.
7020,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7021,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ Was not that right?
7022,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7023,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ I think not. If we were entirely to renounce every thing that may
7024,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"be misused, we should have scarce any enjoyments left; and it is a"
7025,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,proper exercise of our strength of mind to use good things with
7026,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"moderation, when we have it in our power to do otherwise."
7027,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7028,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ But spirituous liquors are not good at all, are they?"
7029,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7030,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ They have so little good and so much bad in them, that I confess"
7031,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,I wish their common use could be abolished altogether. They are
7032,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,generally taken by the lowest class of people for the express purpose of
7033,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,intoxication; and they are much sooner prejudicial to the health than
7034,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"wine, and, indeed, when drunk unmixed, are no better than slow poison."
7035,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7036,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ Spirit of wine is useful, though, for several things—is it not?"
7037,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7038,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Yes; and I would have all spirits kept in the hands of chymists
7039,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,and artists who know how to employ them usefully. Spirits of wine will
7040,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,dissolve many things that water will not. Apothecaries use them in
7041,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"drawing tinctures, and artists in preparing colours and making"
7042,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,varnishes. They are likewise very powerful preservatives from
7043,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,corruption. You may have seen serpents and insects brought from abroad
7044,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,in vials full of spirits.
7045,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7046,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ I have.
7047,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7048,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ And I know of another use of spirits.
7049,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7050,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ What, is that?"
7051,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7052,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ To burn in lamps. My grandmamma has a teakettle with a lamp under
7053,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"it to keep the water hot, and she burns spirits in it."
7054,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7055,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ So she does. Well—so much for the use of these liquors.
7056,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7057,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Geo._ But you have said nothing about ale and beer. Are they wholesome?
7058,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7059,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Tut._ Yes, in moderation. But they are sadly abused too, and rob many"
7060,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,men of their health as well as their money and senses.
7061,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7062,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"_Geo._ Small beer does no harm, however."
7063,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7064,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ No—and we will indulge in a good draught of it when we get home.
7065,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7066,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Har._ I like water better.
7067,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,
7068,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,_Tut._ Then drink it by all means. He that is satisfied with water has
7069,ON WINE AND SPIRITS.,"one want the less, and may defy thirst, in this country, at least."

7084,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"Mr. Wiseman, the schoolmaster, at the end of the summer-vacation,"
7085,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,received a new scholar with the following letter:—
7086,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,
7087,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"“SIR:—This will be delivered to you by my son Samuel, whom I beg leave"
7088,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"to commit to your care, hoping that, by your well-known skill and"
7089,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"attention, you will be able to make something of him, which, I am sorry"
7090,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"to say, none of his masters have hitherto done. He is now eleven, and"
7091,THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.,"yet can do nothing but read his mother-tongue, and that but"

7251,"“WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE, MAN MAY DO.”",avoid hasty judgments. You mentioned in your letter that it had
7252,"“WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE, MAN MAY DO.”",not yet been discovered which way his genius pointed. If by
7253,"“WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE, MAN MAY DO.”",_genius_ you meant such a decided bent of mind to any one pursuit
7254,"“WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE, MAN MAY DO.”","as will lead to excel with little or no labour or instruction, I"

7401,TRIAL[2],"good whipping into the bargain, for injuring a poor widow woman.”"
7402,TRIAL[2],
7403,TRIAL[2],Footnote 2:
7404,TRIAL[2],
7405,TRIAL[2],This was meant as a sequel of that very pleasing and ingenious little
7406,TRIAL[2],"work, entitled _Juvenile Trials_, in which a Court of Justice is"
7407,TRIAL[2],"supposed to be instituted in a boarding-school, composed of the"
7408,TRIAL[2],"scholars themselves, for the purpose of trying offences committed at"
7409,TRIAL[2],school.
7410,TRIAL[2],
7411,TRIAL[2],"The judge having heard Mrs. Careful’s story, desired her to sit down;"
7412,TRIAL[2],"and then calling up Master Luckless, asked him what he had to say for"
7413,TRIAL[2],"himself. Luckless appeared with his face a good deal scratched, and"
7414,TRIAL[2],"looking very ruefully. After making his bow, and sobbing two or three"
7415,TRIAL[2],"times, he said:—"
7416,TRIAL[2],
7417,TRIAL[2],"“My lord, I am as innocent of this matter as any boy in the school, and"
7418,TRIAL[2],"I am sure I have suffered enough about it already. My lord, Billy"
7419,TRIAL[2],"Thompson and I were playing in the lane near Mrs. Careful’s house, when"
7420,TRIAL[2],we heard the window crash; and directly after she came running out
7421,TRIAL[2],"toward us. Upon this, Billy ran away, and I ran too, thinking I might"
7422,TRIAL[2],"bear the blame. But after running a little way, I stumbled over"
7423,TRIAL[2],"something that lay in the road, and before I could get up again she"
7424,TRIAL[2],"overtook me, and caught me by the hair, and began lugging and cuffing"
7425,TRIAL[2],"me. I told her it was not I that broke her window, but it did not"
7426,TRIAL[2],"signify; so she dragged me to the light, lugging and scratching me all"
7427,TRIAL[2],"the while, and then said she would inform against me; and that is all I"
7428,TRIAL[2],know of the matter.”
7429,TRIAL[2],
7430,TRIAL[2],"_Judge._ I find, good woman, you were willing to revenge yourself,"
7431,TRIAL[2],without waiting for the justice of this court.
7432,TRIAL[2],
7433,TRIAL[2],"_Widow Careful._ My lord, I confess I was put into a passion, and did"
7434,TRIAL[2],not properly consider what I was doing.
7435,TRIAL[2],
7436,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ Well, where is Billy Thompson?"
7437,TRIAL[2],
7438,TRIAL[2],"_Billy._ Here, my lord."
7439,TRIAL[2],
7440,TRIAL[2],_Jud._ You have heard what Harry Luckless says. Declare upon your honour
7441,TRIAL[2],whether he has spoken the truth.
7442,TRIAL[2],
7443,TRIAL[2],"_Bil._ My lord, I am sure neither he nor I had any concern in breaking"
7444,TRIAL[2],"the window. We were standing together at the time, and I ran on hearing"
7445,TRIAL[2],"the door open, for fear of being charged with it, and he followed. But"
7446,TRIAL[2],what became of him I did not stay to see.
7447,TRIAL[2],
7448,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ So you let your friend shift for himself, and only thought of"
7449,TRIAL[2],saving yourself. But did you see any other person about the house or in
7450,TRIAL[2],the lane?
7451,TRIAL[2],
7452,TRIAL[2],"_Bil._ My lord, I thought I heard somebody on the other side of the"
7453,TRIAL[2],"hedge, creeping along, a little before the window was broken, but I saw"
7454,TRIAL[2],nobody.
7455,TRIAL[2],
7456,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ You hear, good woman, what is alleged in behalf of the person you"
7457,TRIAL[2],have accused. Have you any other evidence against him?
7458,TRIAL[2],
7459,TRIAL[2],"_Wid._ One might be sure that they would deny it, and tell lies for one"
7460,TRIAL[2],another; but I hope I am not to be put off in that manner.
7461,TRIAL[2],
7462,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ I must tell you, mistress, that you give too much liberty to your"
7463,TRIAL[2],"tongue, and are guilty of as much injustice as that of which you"
7464,TRIAL[2],"complain, I should be sorry, indeed, if the young gentlemen of this"
7465,TRIAL[2],"school deserved the general character of liars. You will find among us,"
7466,TRIAL[2],"I hope, as just a sense of what is right and honourable, as among those"
7467,TRIAL[2],who are older; and our worthy master certainly would not permit us to
7468,TRIAL[2],"try offences in this manner, if he thought us capable of bearing false"
7469,TRIAL[2],witness in each other’s favour.
7470,TRIAL[2],
7471,TRIAL[2],"_Wid._ I ask your lordship’s pardon, I did not mean to offend: but it is"
7472,TRIAL[2],"a heavy loss for a poor woman, and though I did not catch the boy in the"
7473,TRIAL[2],"fact, he was the nearest when it was done."
7474,TRIAL[2],
7475,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ As this is no more than a suspicion, and he has the positive"
7476,TRIAL[2],"evidence of his schoolfellow in his favour, it will be impossible to"
7477,TRIAL[2],"convict him, consistently with the rules of justice. Have you discovered"
7478,TRIAL[2],any other circumstance that may point out the offender?
7479,TRIAL[2],
7480,TRIAL[2],"_Wid._ My lord, next morning Jack found on the floor this top, which I"
7481,TRIAL[2],suppose the window was broken with.
7482,TRIAL[2],
7483,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ Hand it up—here, gentlemen of the jury, please to examine it, and"
7484,TRIAL[2],see if you can discover anything of its owner.
7485,TRIAL[2],
7486,TRIAL[2],_Juryman._ Here is P. R. cut upon it.
7487,TRIAL[2],
7488,TRIAL[2],"_Another._ Yes, and I am sure I remember Peter Riot’s having just such a"
7489,TRIAL[2],one.
7490,TRIAL[2],
7491,TRIAL[2],_Another._ So do I.
7492,TRIAL[2],
7493,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ Master Riot, is this your top?"
7494,TRIAL[2],
7495,TRIAL[2],"_Riot._ I don’t know, my lord, perhaps it may be mine; I have had a"
7496,TRIAL[2],"great many tops, and when I have done with them, I throw them away, and"
7497,TRIAL[2],anybody may pick them up that pleases. You see it has lost its peg.
7498,TRIAL[2],
7499,TRIAL[2],"_Jud._ Very well, sir. Mrs. Careful, you may retire."
7500,TRIAL[2],
7501,TRIAL[2],"_Wid._ And must I have no amends, my lord?"
7502,TRIAL[2],
7503,TRIAL[2],_Jud._ Have patience. Leave everything to the court. We shall do you all
7504,TRIAL[2],the justice in our power.
7505,TRIAL[2],
7506,TRIAL[2],"As soon as the widow was gone, the judge rose from his seat, and with"
7507,TRIAL[2],much solemnity thus addressed the assembly:—
7508,TRIAL[2],
7509,TRIAL[2],"“Gentlemen,—this business, I confess, gives me much dissatisfaction. A"
7510,TRIAL[2],"poor woman has been insulted and injured in her property, apparently"
7511,TRIAL[2],without provocation; and though she has not been able to convict the
7512,TRIAL[2],"offender, it cannot be doubted that she, as well as the world in"
7513,TRIAL[2],"general, will impute the crime to some of our society. Though I am in my"
7514,TRIAL[2],"own mind convinced that in her passion she charged an innocent person,"
7515,TRIAL[2],"yet the circumstance of the top is a strong suspicion, indeed almost a"
7516,TRIAL[2],"proof, that the perpetrator of this unmanly mischief was one of our"
7517,TRIAL[2],"body. The owner of the top has justly observed, that its having been his"
7518,TRIAL[2],"property is no certain proof against him. Since, therefore, in the"
7519,TRIAL[2],"present defect of evidence, the whole school must remain burdened with"
7520,TRIAL[2],"the discredit of this action, and share in the guilt of it, I think fit,"
7521,TRIAL[2],"in the first place, to decree, that restitution shall be made to the"
7522,TRIAL[2],sufferer out of the public chest; and next that a court of inquiry be
7523,TRIAL[2],instituted for the express purpose of searching thoroughly into this
7524,TRIAL[2],"affair, with power to examine all persons upon honour who are thought"
7525,TRIAL[2],"likely to be able to throw light upon it. I hope, gentlemen, these"
7526,TRIAL[2],measures meet with your concurrence?”
7527,TRIAL[2],
7528,TRIAL[2],"The whole court bowed to the judge, and expressed their entire"
7529,TRIAL[2],satisfaction with his determination.
7530,TRIAL[2],
7531,TRIAL[2],It was then ordered that the public treasurer should go to the Widow
7532,TRIAL[2],"Careful’s house, any pay her the sum of one shilling, making at the same"
7533,TRIAL[2],time a handsome apology in the name of the school. And six persons were
7534,TRIAL[2],"taken by lot out of the jury to compose the court of inquiry, which was"
7535,TRIAL[2],to sit in the evening.
7536,TRIAL[2],
7537,TRIAL[2],The court then adjourned.
7538,TRIAL[2],
7539,TRIAL[2],"On the meeting of the court of inquiry, the first thing proposed by the"
7540,TRIAL[2],"president, was, that the persons who usually played with Master Riot"
7541,TRIAL[2],"should be sent for. Accordingly Tom Frisk and Bob Loiter were summoned,"
7542,TRIAL[2],when the president asked them upon their honour if they knew the top to
7543,TRIAL[2],have been Riot’s. They said they did. They were then asked whether they
7544,TRIAL[2],remembered when Riot had it in his possession?
7545,TRIAL[2],
7546,TRIAL[2],"_Frisk._ He had it the day before yesterday, and split a top of mine"
7547,TRIAL[2],with it.
7548,TRIAL[2],
7549,TRIAL[2],"_Loiter._ Yes, and then, as he was making a stroke at mine, the peg flew"
7550,TRIAL[2],out.
7551,TRIAL[2],
7552,TRIAL[2],_President._ What did he then do with it?
7553,TRIAL[2],
7554,TRIAL[2],"_Fr._ He put it into his pocket, and said, as it was a strong top, he"
7555,TRIAL[2],would have it mended.
7556,TRIAL[2],
7557,TRIAL[2],"_Pres._ Then he did not throw it away, or give it to any body?"
7558,TRIAL[2],
7559,TRIAL[2],"_Loit._ No; he pocketed it up, and we saw no more of it."
7560,TRIAL[2],
7561,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ Do you know of any quarrel he had with Widow Careful?
7562,TRIAL[2],
7563,TRIAL[2],"_Fr._ Yes; a day or two before, he went to her shop for some ginger"
7564,TRIAL[2],"bread; but, as he already owed her sixpence, she would not let him have"
7565,TRIAL[2],any till he had paid his debts.
7566,TRIAL[2],
7567,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ How did he take the disappointment?
7568,TRIAL[2],
7569,TRIAL[2],_Fr._ He said he would be revenged on her.
7570,TRIAL[2],
7571,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ Are you sure he used such words?
7572,TRIAL[2],
7573,TRIAL[2],_Fr._ Yes; Loiter heard him as well as myself.
7574,TRIAL[2],
7575,TRIAL[2],"_Loit._ I did, sir."
7576,TRIAL[2],
7577,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ Do either of you know any more of this affair?
7578,TRIAL[2],
7579,TRIAL[2],"_Both._ No, sir."
7580,TRIAL[2],
7581,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ You may go.
7582,TRIAL[2],
7583,TRIAL[2],The President now observed that these witnesses had done a great deal in
7584,TRIAL[2],establishing proofs against Riot; for it was now pretty certain that no
7585,TRIAL[2],one but himself could have been in possession of the top at the time the
7586,TRIAL[2],crime was committed; and also it appeared that he had declared a
7587,TRIAL[2],"malicious intention against the woman, which it was highly probable he"
7588,TRIAL[2],would put into execution.—As the court were debating about the next step
7589,TRIAL[2],"to be taken, they were acquainted that Jack, the widow’s son, was"
7590,TRIAL[2],waiting at the school-door for admission; and a person being sent out
7591,TRIAL[2],"for him, Riot was found threatening the boy, and bidding him go home"
7592,TRIAL[2],"about his business. The boy, however, was conveyed safely into the room,"
7593,TRIAL[2],when he thus addressed himself to the president:—
7594,TRIAL[2],
7595,TRIAL[2],"_Jack._ Sir, and please your worship, as I was looking about this"
7596,TRIAL[2],"morning for sticks in the hedge over against our house, I found this"
7597,TRIAL[2],"buckle. So I thought to myself, sure this must belong to the rascal that"
7598,TRIAL[2],broke our windows. So I have brought it to see if anybody in the school
7599,TRIAL[2],would own it.
7600,TRIAL[2],
7601,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ On which side of the hedge did you find it?
7602,TRIAL[2],
7603,TRIAL[2],"_Jack._ On the other side from our house, in the close."
7604,TRIAL[2],
7605,TRIAL[2],"_Pres._ Let us see it. Gentlemen, this is so smart a buckle, that I am"
7606,TRIAL[2],"sure I remember it at once, and so I dare say you all do."
7607,TRIAL[2],
7608,TRIAL[2],_Al_l. It is Riot’s.
7609,TRIAL[2],
7610,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ Has anybody observed Riot’s shoes to-day?
7611,TRIAL[2],
7612,TRIAL[2],"_One Boy._ Yes, he has got them tied with strings."
7613,TRIAL[2],
7614,TRIAL[2],"_Pres._ Very well, gentlemen; we have nothing more to do than to draw up"
7615,TRIAL[2],"an account of all the evidence we have heard, and lay it before his"
7616,TRIAL[2],"lordship. Jack, you may go home."
7617,TRIAL[2],
7618,TRIAL[2],"_Jack._ Pray, sir, let somebody go with me, for I am afraid of Riot, who"
7619,TRIAL[2],has just been threatening me at the door.
7620,TRIAL[2],
7621,TRIAL[2],_Pres._ Master Bold will please to go along with the boy.
7622,TRIAL[2],
7623,TRIAL[2],"The minutes of the court were then drawn up, and the President took them"
7624,TRIAL[2],"to the judge’s chamber. After the judge had perused them, he ordered an"
7625,TRIAL[2],"endictment to be drawn up against Peter Riot, “for that he meanly,"
7626,TRIAL[2],"clandestinely, and with malice aforethought, had broken three panes in"
7627,TRIAL[2],"the window of Widow Careful, with a certain instrument called a top,"
7628,TRIAL[2],"whereby he had committed an atrocious injury on an innocent person, and"
7629,TRIAL[2],had brought a disgrace upon the society to which he belonged.” At the
7630,TRIAL[2],"same time, he sent an officer to inform Master Riot that his trial would"
7631,TRIAL[2],come on next morning.
7632,TRIAL[2],
7633,TRIAL[2],"Riot, who was with some of his gay companions, affected to treat the"
7634,TRIAL[2],"matter with great indifference, and even to make a jest of it. However,"
7635,TRIAL[2],in the morning he thought it best to endeavour to make it up; and
7636,TRIAL[2],"accordingly, when the court was assembled, he sent one of his friends"
7637,TRIAL[2],"with a shilling, saying that he would not trouble them with any further"
7638,TRIAL[2],"inquiries, but would pay the sum that had been issued out of the public"
7639,TRIAL[2],stock. On the receipt of this message the Judge rose with much severity
7640,TRIAL[2],"in his countenance; and observing, that by such a contemptuous behaviour"
7641,TRIAL[2],"towards the court the criminal had greatly added to his offence, he"
7642,TRIAL[2],ordered two officers with their staves immediately to go and bring in
7643,TRIAL[2],"Riot, and to use force if he should resist them. The culprit, thinking"
7644,TRIAL[2],"it best to submit, was presently led in between the two officers; when,"
7645,TRIAL[2],"being placed at the bar, the judge thus addressed him:—"
7646,TRIAL[2],
7647,TRIAL[2],"“I am sorry, sir, that any member of this society can be so little"
7648,TRIAL[2],"sensible of the nature of a crime, and so little acquainted with the"
7649,TRIAL[2],"principles of a court of justice, as you have shown yourself to be, by"
7650,TRIAL[2],the proposal you took the improper liberty of sending to us. If you
7651,TRIAL[2],"meant it as a confession of your guilt, you certainly ought to have"
7652,TRIAL[2],"waited to receive from us the penalty we thought proper to inflict, and"
7653,TRIAL[2],not to have imagined that an offer of the mere payment of damages would
7654,TRIAL[2],satisfy the claims of justice against you. If you had only broken the
7655,TRIAL[2],"window by accident, and of your own accord offered restitution, nothing"
7656,TRIAL[2],less than the full damages could have been accepted. But you now stand
7657,TRIAL[2],"charged with having done this mischief, meanly, secretly, and"
7658,TRIAL[2],"maliciously, and thereby have added a great deal of criminal intention"
7659,TRIAL[2],"to the act. Can you then think that a court like this, designed to watch"
7660,TRIAL[2],"over the morals, as well as protect the properties of our community, can"
7661,TRIAL[2],so slightly pass over such aggravated offences? You can claim no merit
7662,TRIAL[2],"from confessing the crime, now that you know so much evidence will"
7663,TRIAL[2],"appear against you. And if you choose still to plead not guilty, you are"
7664,TRIAL[2],"at liberty to do it, and we will proceed immediately to the trial,"
7665,TRIAL[2],without taking any advantage of the confession implied by your offer of
7666,TRIAL[2],payment.”
7667,TRIAL[2],
7668,TRIAL[2],"Riot stood silent for some time, and then begged to be allowed to"
7669,TRIAL[2],consult with his friends what was best for him to do. This was agreed
7670,TRIAL[2],"to, and he was permitted to retire, though under guard of an officer."
7671,TRIAL[2],"After a short absence, he returned with more humility in his looks, and"
7672,TRIAL[2],"said that he pleaded guilty, and threw himself on the mercy of the"
7673,TRIAL[2],"court. The judge then made a speech of some length, for the purpose of"
7674,TRIAL[2],convincing the prisoner as well as the bystanders of the enormity of the
7675,TRIAL[2],crime. He then pronounced the following sentence:—
7676,TRIAL[2],
7677,TRIAL[2],"“You, Peter Riot, are hereby sentenced to pay the sum of half a crown to"
7678,TRIAL[2],"the public treasury, as a satisfaction for the mischief you have done,"
7679,TRIAL[2],and your attempt to conceal it. You are to repair to the house of Widow
7680,TRIAL[2],"Careful, accompanied by such witnesses as we shall appoint, and there"
7681,TRIAL[2],"having first paid her the sum you owe her, you shall ask her pardon for"
7682,TRIAL[2],"the insult you offered her. You shall likewise, to-morrow, after school,"
7683,TRIAL[2],"stand up in your place, and before all the scholars ask pardon for the"
7684,TRIAL[2],disgrace you have been the means of bringing upon the society; and in
7685,TRIAL[2],"particular you shall apologise to Master Luckless, for the disagreeable"
7686,TRIAL[2],circumstance you were the means of bringing him into. Till all this is
7687,TRIAL[2],"complied with, you shall not presume to come into the play-ground, or"
7688,TRIAL[2],join in any of the diversions of the school; and all persons are hereby
7689,TRIAL[2],admonished not to keep your company till this is done.”
7690,TRIAL[2],
7691,TRIAL[2],Riot was then dismissed to his room; and in the afternoon he was taken
7692,TRIAL[2],"to the widow’s, who was pleased to receive his submission graciously,"
7693,TRIAL[2],and at the same time to apologise for her own improper treatment of
7694,TRIAL[2],"Master Luckless, to whom she sent a present of a nice ball by way of"
7695,TRIAL[2],amends.
7696,TRIAL[2],
7697,TRIAL[2],Thus ended this important business.

7746,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"the first place, they do not much resemble each other in size or colour."
7747,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7748,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ No—but I think they do in shape.
7749,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7750,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True. They are both irregular flowers, and have the same"
7751,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"distribution of parts. They are of the kind called _papilionaceous_,"
7752,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"from _papilio_, the Latin word for a butterfly, which insect they are"
7753,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,thought to resemble.
7754,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7755,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ The pea does a little, but not much."
7756,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7757,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Some do much more than these. Well—you see first a broad leaf
7758,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"standing upright, but somewhat bent back; this is named the _standard_."
7759,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"On each side are two narrower, called the _wings_. The under side of the"
7760,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,flower is formed of a hollow part resembling a boat: this is called a
7761,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_keel_.
7762,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7763,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ It is very like a boat indeed!
7764,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7765,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ In some kinds, however, it is divided in the middle, and so is"
7766,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,like a boat split in two. All these parts have claws which unite to form
7767,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"a tube, set in a _calyx_, or flower-cup. This tube, you observe, is"
7768,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"longer in the bean than in the pea, and the proportions of the other"
7769,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,parts are somewhat different; but the parts themselves are found in
7770,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,both.
7771,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7772,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ So they are. I think them alike now.
7773,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7774,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ That is the consequence of examining closely. Now let us strip
7775,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,off all the leaves of this bean-flower but the keel. What do you think
7776,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,this boat contains?
7777,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7778,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ It must be those little things you told us are in all flowers.
7779,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7780,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ The chives and pistil.
7781,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7782,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Right. I will draw down the keel gently, and you shall see them."
7783,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7784,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ How curious!
7785,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7786,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Here are a number of chives joining in their bodies, so as to"
7787,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"make a round tube, or cylinder, through which comes out a crooked"
7788,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"thread, which is the pistil. I will now with a pin slit this cylinder."
7789,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,What do you see within it?
7790,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7791,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Somewhat like a little pod.
7792,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7793,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True—and to show you that it is a pod, I will open it, and you"
7794,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,shall see the seeds within it.
7795,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7796,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ What tiny things! Is this, then, what makes the bean-pod"
7797,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,afterward?
7798,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7799,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ It is. When the blossom drops, this seed-vessel grows bigger and"
7800,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"bigger, and at length hardens as the seeds grow ripe, becomes black and"
7801,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"shrivelled, and would burst and shed the seeds, if they were not"
7802,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,gathered.
7803,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7804,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I have seen several burst pods of our sweet-peas under the wall,"
7805,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,with nothing left in them.
7806,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7807,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ And it is common for the field peas and beans to lose a great
7808,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,part of the seeds while they are getting in.
7809,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7810,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ At the bottom of this pea-stalk there are some pods set already.
7811,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7812,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Open one. You see that the pod is composed of two shells, and"
7813,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"that all the seeds are fastened to one side of the pod, but alternately"
7814,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,to each shell.
7815,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7816,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Is it the same in beans?
7817,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7818,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes, and in all other pods of the papilionaceous flowers."
7819,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,Well—this is the general structure of a very numerous and useful class
7820,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"of plants, called the _leguminous_ or _podded_. Of these, in this"
7821,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"country, the greater part are herbaceous, with some shrubs. In the warm"
7822,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,climates there are also tall trees. Many of the leguminous plants afford
7823,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,excellent nourishment for man and beast; and their pods have the name of
7824,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_pulse_.
7825,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7826,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I have read of persons living on pulse, but I did not know what"
7827,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,it meant before.
7828,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7829,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ It is frequently mentioned as part of the diet of abstemious
7830,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"persons. Of this kind, we eat peas, beans, and kidney or French beans,"
7831,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,of all which there are a variety of sorts cultivated. Other nations eat
7832,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"lentils and lupines, which are of this class; with several others."
7833,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7834,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ I remember our lupines in the garden have flowers of this kind,"
7835,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,with pods growing in clusters. We only cultivate them for the colour and
7836,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,smell.
7837,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7838,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ But other nations eat them. Then, all the kinds of clover, or"
7839,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"trefoil, which are so useful in feeding cattle, belong to this tribe; as"
7840,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"do likewise vetches, sanfoin, and lucerne, which are used for the same"
7841,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"purpose. These principally compose what are usually, though improperly,"
7842,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"called, in agriculture, _artificial grasses_."
7843,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7844,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Clover flowers are as sweet as beans; but do they bear pods?
7845,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7846,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes; very short ones, with one or two seeds in each. But there is"
7847,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"a kind called nonsuch, with a very small yellow flower, that has a"
7848,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,curious twisted pod like a snail-shell. Many of the leguminous plants
7849,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"are weak, and cannot support themselves; hence they are furnished with"
7850,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"tendrils, by means of which they clasp neighbouring plants, and run up"
7851,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,them. You know the garden-peas do so on the sticks which are set in the
7852,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"rows with them. Some kind of vetches run in this manner up the hedges,"
7853,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,which they decorate with their long bunches of blue or purple flowers.
7854,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"Tares, which are some of the slenderest of the family, do much mischief"
7855,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,among corn by twining round it and choking it.
7856,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7857,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ What are they good for, then?"
7858,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7859,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ They are weeds or noxious plants with respect to us; but
7860,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,doubtless they have their uses in the creation. Some of our
7861,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"papilionaceous plants, however, are able enough to shift for themselves;"
7862,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,for gorse or furze is of the number.
7863,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7864,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ What, that prickly bush all covered over with yellow flowers,"
7865,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,that overruns our common?
7866,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7867,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Then there is broom, a plant as big, but without thorns, and with"
7868,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,larger flowers. This is as frequent as furze in some places.
7869,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7870,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I know it grows in abundance in the broom-field.
7871,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7872,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ It does; but the naming of fields and places from it is a proof
7873,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,that it is not so common as the other.
7874,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7875,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ We have some bushes of white broom in the shrubbery, and some"
7876,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,trees of Spanish broom.
7877,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7878,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True. You have also a small tree which flowers early, and bears a"
7879,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"great many pendent branches of yellow blossoms, that look peculiarly"
7880,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,beautiful when intermixed with the purple lilacs.
7881,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7882,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I know it—laburnum.
7883,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7884,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Right. This is one of our class of plants too. Then there is a
7885,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"large tree, with delicate little leaves, protected by long thorns, and"
7886,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,bearing bunches of white papilionaceous flowers.
7887,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7888,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I know which you mean, but I cannot tell the name."
7889,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7890,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ It is the bastard-acacia, or locust-tree, a native of America."
7891,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"Thus, you see, we have traced this class of plants through all sizes,"
7892,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"from the trefoil that covers the turf, to a large tree. I should not,"
7893,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"however, forget two others, the licorice, and the tamarind. The"
7894,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"licorice, with the sweet root of which you are well acquainted, grows in"
7895,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"the warmer countries, especially Spain, but is cultivated in some parts"
7896,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"of England, especially at Pomfret, in Yorkshire. The tamarind is a large"
7897,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"spreading tree growing in the West Indies, and valued for its shade, as"
7898,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"well as for the cooling acid pulp of its pods, which are preserved with"
7899,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,sugar and sent over to us.
7900,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7901,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I know them very well.
7902,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7903,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Well—do you think now you shall both be able to discover a
7904,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,papilionaceous flower when you meet with it again?
7905,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7906,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I believe I shall, if they are all like these we have been"
7907,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,examining.
7908,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7909,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ They have all the same parts, though variously proportioned. What"
7910,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,are these?
7911,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7912,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ There is the standard and two wings.
7913,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7914,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Har._ And the keel.
7915,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7916,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Right—the keel sometimes cleft into two, and then it is an"
7917,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"irregular five-leaved flower. The chives are generally ten, of which one"
7918,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"stands apart from the rest. The pistil single, and ending in a pod."
7919,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"Another circumstance common to most of this tribe, is, that their leaves"
7920,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"are _winged_, or _pinnated_, that is, having leaflets set opposite each"
7921,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"other, upon a middle rib. You see this structure in these bean-leaves."
7922,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"But in the clovers there are only two opposite leaflets, and one"
7923,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"terminating; whence their name of trefoil, or three-leaf. What we call a"
7924,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"club on cards is properly a clover-leaf, and the French call it"
7925,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_trefle_, which means the same."
7926,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7927,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ I think this tribe of plants almost as useful as the grasses.
7928,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7929,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ They perhaps come the next in utility: but their seeds, such as"
7930,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"beans and peas, are not quite such good nourishment as corn, and bread"
7931,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,cannot be made of them.
7932,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7933,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ But clover is better than grass for cattle.
7934,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7935,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ It is more fattening, and makes cows yield plenty of fine milk."
7936,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,Well—let us march.
7937,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7938,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7939,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7940,THE LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.,
7941,ON MAN.,ON MAN.
7942,ON MAN.,
7943,ON MAN.,
7944,ON MAN.,"_Charles._ You gave me the definition of a horse some time ago—Pray,"
7945,ON MAN.,"sir, how is a man defined?"
7946,ON MAN.,
7947,ON MAN.,_Father._ That is worth inquiring. Let us consider then. He must either
7948,ON MAN.,"stand by himself, or be ranked among the quadrupeds; for there are no"
7949,ON MAN.,"other two-legged animals but birds, which he certainly does not"
7950,ON MAN.,resemble.
7951,ON MAN.,
7952,ON MAN.,_Ch._ But how can he be made a quadruped?
7953,ON MAN.,
7954,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ By setting him to crawl on the ground, in which case he will as"
7955,ON MAN.,much resemble a baboon as a baboon set on his hind-legs does a man. In
7956,ON MAN.,"reality, there is little difference between the arms of a man and the"
7957,ON MAN.,fore-legs of a quadruped; and in all other circumstances of internal and
7958,ON MAN.,"external structure, they are evidently formed upon the same model."
7959,ON MAN.,
7960,ON MAN.,"_Ch._ I suppose then we must call him a digitated quadruped, that"
7961,ON MAN.,generally goes upon its hind legs.
7962,ON MAN.,
7963,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ A naturalist could not reckon him otherwise; and, accordingly,"
7964,ON MAN.,"Linnæus has placed him in the same division with apes, macocos, and"
7965,ON MAN.,bats.
7966,ON MAN.,
7967,ON MAN.,"_Ch._ Apes, macocos, and bats!"
7968,ON MAN.,
7969,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ Yes—they have all four cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and teats"
7970,ON MAN.,on the breast. How do your like your relations?
7971,ON MAN.,
7972,ON MAN.,_Ch._ Not at all!
7973,ON MAN.,
7974,ON MAN.,_Fa._ Then we will get rid of them by applying to the other part of
7975,ON MAN.,"human nature—the _mind_. Man is an animal possessed of _reason_, and the"
7976,ON MAN.,"only one. This, therefore, is enough to define him."
7977,ON MAN.,
7978,ON MAN.,"_Ch._ I have often heard that man is a rational creature, and I have a"
7979,ON MAN.,notion what that means; but I should like to have an exact definition of
7980,ON MAN.,reason.
7981,ON MAN.,
7982,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ Reason is the faculty by which we compare ideas, and draw"
7983,ON MAN.,conclusions. A man walking in the woods of an unknown country finds a
7984,ON MAN.,"bow. He compares it in his mind with other bows, and forms the"
7985,ON MAN.,"conclusion that it must have been made by man, and that therefore the"
7986,ON MAN.,country is probably inhabited. He discovers a hut; sees in it half-burnt
7987,ON MAN.,"wood, and finds that the ashes are not quite cold. He concludes,"
7988,ON MAN.,"therefore, with certainty, not only that there are inhabitants, but that"
7989,ON MAN.,they cannot be far distant. No other animal could do this.
7990,ON MAN.,
7991,ON MAN.,_Ch._ But would not a dog who had been used to live with men run into
7992,ON MAN.,such a hut and expect to find people in it?
7993,ON MAN.,
7994,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ He probably would—and this, I acknowledge, is very like reason;"
7995,ON MAN.,for he may be supposed to compare in his mind the hut he has lived in
7996,ON MAN.,"with that he sees, and to conclude that as there were men in the first"
7997,ON MAN.,there are in the last. But how little a way does this carry him? He
7998,ON MAN.,"finds no men there, and he is unable by any marks to form any judgment"
7999,ON MAN.,"how long they have been absent, or what sort of people they were; still"
8000,ON MAN.,less does he form any plan of conduct in consequence of his discovery.
8001,ON MAN.,
8002,ON MAN.,"_Ch._ Then is not the difference only that man has much reason, and"
8003,ON MAN.,brutes little?
8004,ON MAN.,
8005,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ If we adhere to the mere words of the definition of reason, I"
8006,ON MAN.,"believe this must be admitted; but in the exercise of it, the"
8007,ON MAN.,"superiority of the human faculties is so great, that man is in many"
8008,ON MAN.,points absolutely distinguished from brutes. In the first place he has
8009,ON MAN.,"the _use of speech_, which no other animal has attained."
8010,ON MAN.,
8011,ON MAN.,_Ch._ Cannot many animals make themselves understood by one another by
8012,ON MAN.,their cries?
8013,ON MAN.,
8014,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ They can make known a few of their common wants and desires, but"
8015,ON MAN.,"they cannot _discourse_, or communicate ideas stored up in the memory."
8016,ON MAN.,"It is this faculty which makes man an _improvable_ being, the wisdom and"
8017,ON MAN.,"experience acquired by one individual being thus transmitted to others,"
8018,ON MAN.,and so on in an endless series of progression.
8019,ON MAN.,
8020,ON MAN.,There is no reason to suppose that the dogs of the present day are more
8021,ON MAN.,knowing than those which lived a thousand years ago; but the men of this
8022,ON MAN.,age are much better acquainted with numberless arts and sciences than
8023,ON MAN.,"their remote ancestors; since, by the use of speech and of writing"
8024,ON MAN.,"(which is speech addressed to the eye), every age adds its own"
8025,ON MAN.,discoveries to all former ones. This knowledge of the past likewise
8026,ON MAN.,gives man a great insight into the future. Shakspeare excellently
8027,ON MAN.,"defines man by saying that he is a creature “made with large discourse,"
8028,ON MAN.,looking before and after.”
8029,ON MAN.,
8030,ON MAN.,"_Ch._ Animals must surely know something of the future, when they lay up"
8031,ON MAN.,a store of provisions for the winter.
8032,ON MAN.,
8033,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ No—it is pretty certain that this is not the case, for they will"
8034,ON MAN.,do it as much the first year of their lives as any other. Young bees
8035,ON MAN.,"turned out of their hive, as soon as they have swarmed and got a"
8036,ON MAN.,"habitation, begin laying up honey, though they cannot possibly foresee"
8037,ON MAN.,the use they shall have for it. There are a vast number of actions of
8038,ON MAN.,"this kind in animals which are directed to a useful end, but an end"
8039,ON MAN.,"which the animal knows nothing of. And this is what we call _instinct_,"
8040,ON MAN.,and properly distinguish from reason. Man has less of it than almost any
8041,ON MAN.,"other animal, because he wants it less. Another point of essential"
8042,ON MAN.,"difference is, that man is the only animal that makes use of"
8043,ON MAN.,_instruments_ in any of his actions. He is a _tool-making_ and
8044,ON MAN.,_machine-making_ animal. By means of this faculty alone he is every
8045,ON MAN.,"where lord of the creation, and has equally triumphed over the subtlety"
8046,ON MAN.,"of the cunning, the swiftness of the fleet, and the force of the strong."
8047,ON MAN.,"He is the only animal that has found out the use of _fire_, a most"
8048,ON MAN.,important acquisition!
8049,ON MAN.,
8050,ON MAN.,_Ch._ I have read of some large apes that will come and sit round a fire
8051,ON MAN.,"in the woods when men have left it, but have not the sense to keep it"
8052,ON MAN.,"in, by throwing on sticks."
8053,ON MAN.,
8054,ON MAN.,_Fa._ Still less then could they light a fire. In consequence of this
8055,ON MAN.,"discovery man cooks his food, which no other animal does. He alone"
8056,ON MAN.,fences against the cold by clothing as well as by fire. He alone
8057,ON MAN.,"cultivates the earth, and keeps living animals for future uses."
8058,ON MAN.,
8059,ON MAN.,_Ch._ But have not there been wild men bred in the woods that could do
8060,ON MAN.,none of these things?
8061,ON MAN.,
8062,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ Some instances of this kind are recorded, and they are not to be"
8063,ON MAN.,"wondered at; for man was meant to be a _gregarious_ animal, or one"
8064,ON MAN.,"living in society, in which alone his faculties have full scope, and"
8065,ON MAN.,especially his power of improving by the use of speech. These poor
8066,ON MAN.,"solitary creatures, brought up with the brutes, were in a state entirely"
8067,ON MAN.,"unnatural to them. A solitary bee, ant, or beaver, would have none of"
8068,ON MAN.,the skill and sagacity of those animals in their proper social
8069,ON MAN.,"condition. Society sharpens all the faculties, and gives ideas and views"
8070,ON MAN.,which never could have been entertained by an individual.
8071,ON MAN.,
8072,ON MAN.,_Ch._ But some men that live in society seem to be little above the
8073,ON MAN.,"brutes, at least when compared with other men. What is a Hottentot in"
8074,ON MAN.,comparison with one of us?
8075,ON MAN.,
8076,ON MAN.,"_Fa._ The difference, indeed, is great; but we agree in the most"
8077,ON MAN.,"essential characters of _man_, and perhaps the advantage is not all on"
8078,ON MAN.,our side. The Hottentot cultivates the earth and rears cattle. He not
8079,ON MAN.,"only herds with his fellows, but he has instituted some sort of"
8080,ON MAN.,government for the protection of the weak against the strong; he has a
8081,ON MAN.,"notion of right and wrong, and is sensible of the necessity of"
8082,ON MAN.,controlling present appetites and passions for the sake of a future
8083,ON MAN.,"good. He has therefore _morals_. He is possessed of weapons, tools,"

8085,ON MAN.,"knowledge of various circumstances relative to the nature of animals, he"
8086,ON MAN.,surpasses us. His inferiority lies in those things in which many of the
8087,ON MAN.,lowest class among us are equally inferior to the instructed.
8088,ON MAN.,
8089,ON MAN.,_Ch._ But Hottentots have no notion of a God or a future state.
8090,ON MAN.,
8091,ON MAN.,_Fa._ I am not certain how far that is fact: but alas! how many among us
8092,ON MAN.,"have no knowledge at all on these subjects, or only some vague notions"
8093,ON MAN.,full of absurdity and superstition! People far advanced in civilization
8094,ON MAN.,"have held the grossest errors on these subjects, which are only to be"
8095,ON MAN.,"corrected by the serious application of reason, or by a direct"
8096,ON MAN.,revelation from Heaven.
8097,ON MAN.,
8098,ON MAN.,_Ch._ You said man was an _improveable_ creature—but have not many
8099,ON MAN.,nations been a long time in a savage state without improvement?
8100,ON MAN.,
8101,ON MAN.,_Fa._ Man is always _capable of improvement_; but he may exist a long
8102,ON MAN.,"time, in society, without _actually improving_ beyond a certain point."
8103,ON MAN.,There is little improvement among nations who have not the art of
8104,ON MAN.,"_writing_, for tradition is not capable of preserving very accurate or"
8105,ON MAN.,"extensive knowledge; and many arts and sciences, after flourishing"
8106,ON MAN.,"greatly, have been entirely lost, in countries which have been overrun"
8107,ON MAN.,by barbarous and illiterate nations. Then there is a principle which I
8108,ON MAN.,"might have mentioned as one of those that distinguish man from brutes,"
8109,ON MAN.,"but it as much distinguishes some men from others. This is _curiosity_,"
8110,ON MAN.,or the love of knowledge for its own sake. Most savages have little or
8111,ON MAN.,nothing of this; but without it we should want one of the chief
8112,ON MAN.,inducements to exert our faculties. It is curiosity that impels us to
8113,ON MAN.,"search into the properties of every part of nature, to try all sorts of"
8114,ON MAN.,"experiments, to visit distant regions, and even to examine the"
8115,ON MAN.,appearances and motions of the heavenly bodies. Every fact thus
8116,ON MAN.,discovered leads to other facts; and there is no limit to be set to this
8117,ON MAN.,"progress. The time may come, when what we now know may seem as much"
8118,ON MAN.,ignorance to future ages as the knowledge of early times does to us.
8119,ON MAN.,
8120,ON MAN.,_Ch._ What nations know the most at present?
8121,ON MAN.,
8122,ON MAN.,_Fa._ The Europeans have long been distinguished for superior ardour
8123,ON MAN.,"after knowledge, and they possess beyond comparison the greatest share"
8124,ON MAN.,"of it, whereby they have been enabled to command the rest of the world."
8125,ON MAN.,The countries in which the arts and sciences most flourish at present
8126,ON MAN.,"are the northern and middle parts of Europe, and also North America,"
8127,ON MAN.,"which, is inhabited by descendants of Europeans. In these countries man"
8128,ON MAN.,may be said to be _most man_; and they may apply to themselves the
8129,ON MAN.,poet’s boast:—
8130,ON MAN.,
8131,ON MAN.,"“Man is the nobler growth these realms supply,"
8132,ON MAN.,And souls are ripened in our northern sky.”

8176,WALKING THE STREETS.—A PARABLE.,"interest, and others follow close upon our heels. Now, we ought in the"

8207,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_George._ Harry, can you blow off all of these dandelion feathers at a"
8208,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,puff?
8209,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8210,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Harry._ I will try.
8211,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8212,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ See—you have left almost half of them.
8213,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8214,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Can you do better?
8215,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8216,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ Yes—look here.
8217,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8218,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ There are still several left.
8219,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8220,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ A pretty child’s play you have got there. Bring me one of the
8221,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"dandelion heads, and let us see if we can make no other use of it."
8222,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8223,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Here is a very full one.
8224,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8225,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Do you know what these feathers, as you call them, are?"
8226,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8227,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ I believe they belong to the seed.
8228,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8229,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ They do, and they are worth examining. Look at this single one"
8230,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"through my magnifying glass; you observe the seed at the bottom, like"
8231,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,the point of a dart. From it springs a slender hairy shaft crowned by a
8232,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,very elegant spreading plume. You see it is a complete arrow of Nature’s
8233,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,manufacture.
8234,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8235,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ How exact!
8236,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8237,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ What a beautiful thing!
8238,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8239,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ I am sure you see the use of it at once.
8240,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8241,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ It is to set the seeds a flying with the wind.
8242,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8243,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ And I suppose they sow themselves where they light?
8244,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8245,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ They do. This is one of Nature’s contrivances for
8246,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_dissemination_, or that scattering of the seeds of plants which makes"
8247,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,them reach all the places proper for their growth. I dare say you have
8248,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,observed other plants furnished with the same winged or feathered seeds.
8249,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8250,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Har._ O yes—there are groundsel, and ragwort, and thistles."
8251,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8252,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ In a windy day I have seen the air all full of thistle-down.
8253,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8254,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ Very likely: and for that reason you never saw a new-made bank of
8255,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"earth, or a heap of dung in the fields, but it was presently covered"
8256,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"with thistles. These, and the other plants that have been named, belong"
8257,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"to a very extensive class, which it is worth while being acquainted"
8258,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,with. They are called the _compound-flowered plants_.
8259,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8260,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ Will you be so good as to give us a lecture about them?
8261,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8262,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ With all my heart. Get me a dandelion in flower, a thistle-head,"
8263,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"and a daisy—if you cannot find a common daisy, one of the great ox-eye"
8264,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,daisies in the corn will do as well.
8265,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8266,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo. and Har._ Here they are.
8267,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8268,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ Very well. All these are _compound flowers_; for if you will
8269,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"examine them narrowly, you will perceive that they consist of a number"
8270,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"of little flowers, or _florets_, enclosed in a common cup, which cup is"
8271,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"made of a number of scales, lying on each other like the tiles of a"
8272,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,house.
8273,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8274,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ I see it.
8275,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8276,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ The florets are not all alike in shape. In the dandelion you will
8277,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"observe that they consist of a tube, from which, at its upper end,"
8278,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,proceeds a sort of strap-shaped tongue or fillet; in the thistle they
8279,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"are tubular or funnel-shaped throughout; in the daisy the centre ones,"
8280,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"which form the _disk_, as it is called, are tubular, while those in the"
8281,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"circumference have a broad strap on one side, which altogether compose"
8282,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,the _rays_ of the flowers; whence this sort are called _radiated_. Now
8283,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,take the glass and examine the florets singly. Can you discern their
8284,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,chives and pointals?
8285,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8286,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ I can.
8287,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8288,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ You may remark that there are five chives to each, the tips of"
8289,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"which unite into a tube, through which the pointal passes, having its"
8290,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"summit doubled, and curled back."
8291,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8292,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Har._ I can just make it out with the glass, but hardly with the naked"
8293,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,eye.
8294,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8295,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ It is from this circumstance of the tips of the chives growing
8296,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,together that Linnæus has taken his distinction of the whole class; and
8297,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"he has named it _Syngenesia_, from two Greek words having that"
8298,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,signification. You will further observe that all these florets stand
8299,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"upon a stool or receptacle at the bottom of the flower, which is the"
8300,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,cushion left on the dandelion-stalk after the seeds are blown away. Into
8301,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"this the seeds are slightly stuck, which are one apiece to every perfect"
8302,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,or fertile floret. This is the general structure of the compound
8303,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,flowers.
8304,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8305,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Are all their seeds feathered?
8306,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8307,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ Not all. These of the daisy are not. But in a great many species
8308,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,they are.
8309,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8310,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ I should have thought these were a very useful class of plants by
8311,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"the pains nature has taken to spread them, if you had not told us that"
8312,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"thistles, and ragwort, and groundsel, were some of them."
8313,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8314,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ And if you do not confine your idea of usefulness to what is
8315,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"serviceable to man, but extend it to the whole creation, you may safely"
8316,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"conclude, from their abundance, that they must be highly useful in the"
8317,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"general economy of nature. In fact, no plants feed a greater number of"
8318,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"insects, and none are more important to the small birds, to whom they"
8319,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"furnish food by their seeds, and a fine warm down for lining their"
8320,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,nests. On the approach of winter you may see whole flocks of linnets and
8321,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,goldfinches pecking among the thistles; and you know that groundsel is a
8322,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"favourite treat to birds in a cage. To man, however, they are for the"
8323,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"most part troublesome and unsightly weeds. Burdock, thistles, and"
8324,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"yarrow, overrun his hedge-banks; dandelion, and hawkweed, which much"
8325,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"resembles it, fill his meadows; the tall and branching ragwort, and blue"
8326,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"succory, cumber his pastures; and wild camomile, ox-eye, and"
8327,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"corn-marygold, choke up his cornfields. These plants in general have a"
8328,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"bitter nauseous taste, so that no cattle will touch them. Daisies, I"
8329,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"believe, are the chief exception."
8330,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8331,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ But some of them, I suppose, are useful to man?"
8332,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8333,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes, several, and in various ways. Some that have milky bitter"
8334,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,juices are employed in medicine for purifying the blood and removing
8335,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"obstructions. Of these are dandelion, succory, and sow-thistle. Many"
8336,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"others are bitter, and strongly aromatic; as camomile, wormwood,"
8337,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"southernwood, feverfew, and tansy; these are good for strengthening the"
8338,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"stomach and expelling worms. That capital ingredient in salad, lettuce,"
8339,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"is of this class, and so is endive. Artichoke forms a very singular"
8340,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"article of diet, for the part chiefly eaten, called the bottom, is the"
8341,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"receptacle of the flower, upon which the choke, or seeds with their"
8342,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"feathers, is placed. It is said that some of the larger species of"
8343,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,thistles may be dressed and eaten the same way. Then there is Jerusalem
8344,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"artichoke, which is the root of a species of sunflower, and, when"
8345,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"boiled, much resembles in taste an artichoke bottom. On the whole,"
8346,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"however, a very small proportion of this class of plants is used in"
8347,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,food.
8348,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8349,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ Are there no garden-flowers belonging to them?
8350,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
8351,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Several, especially of the autumnal ones. There are sunflowers of"
8352,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"various kinds, which are the largest flowers the garden produces, though"
8353,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"not the most sightly; marygolds, both the common, and the French and"
8354,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"African, asters, china-asters, golden-rod, and chrysanthemums. Very few"
8355,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"flowers of this class have an agreeable scent, and their shape is not"
8356,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"the most pleasing; but they have often gay colours, and make a figure in"
8357,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,the garden when other things are over. Well—this is most that I
8358,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,recollect worth noticing of the compound-flowered plants. They are a
8359,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"difficult class to make out botanically, though pretty easily known from"
8360,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,each other by sight. I will take care to point out to you the principal
8361,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"of them that we meet with in our walks, and you must get acquainted with"
8362,THE COMPOUND-FLOWERED PLANTS.,them.

8390,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,

8404,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8405,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ Why, mamma?"
8406,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8407,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ Because instances are every day happening in which it is our
8408,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,duty to assist fellow-creatures in circumstances of pain and distress;
8409,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,and if we were to indulge a reluctance to come near to them on those
8410,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"occasions, we should never acquire either the knowledge or the presence"
8411,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,of mind necessary for the purpose.
8412,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8413,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ But if I had been told how to help people in such cases, could"
8414,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,not I do it without being used to see them?
8415,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8416,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ No. We have all naturally a horror at everything which is the
8417,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,cause of pain and danger to ourselves or others; and nothing but habit
8418,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,can give most of us the presence of mind necessary to enable us in such
8419,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,occurrences to employ our knowledge to the best advantage.
8420,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8421,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ What is _presence of mind_, mamma?"
8422,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8423,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ It is that steady possession of ourselves in cases of alarm,"
8424,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,that prevents us from being flurried and frightened. You have heard the
8425,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,expression of _having all our wits about us_. That is the effect of
8426,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"presence of mind, and a most inestimable quality it is, for without it"
8427,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,we are full as likely to run into danger as to avoid it. Do you not
8428,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,remember hearing of your cousin Mary’s cap taking fire from a candle?
8429,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8430,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ O yes—very well.
8431,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8432,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Well—the maid, as soon as she saw it, set up a great scream,"
8433,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,and ran out of the room; and Mary might have been burnt to death for any
8434,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,assistance she could give her.
8435,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8436,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ How foolish that was!
8437,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8438,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Yes—the girl had not the least presence of mind, and the"
8439,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"consequence was, depriving her of all recollection, and making her"
8440,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"entirely useless. But as soon as your aunt came up, she took the right"
8441,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,method for preventing the mischief. The cap was too much on fire to be
8442,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,pulled off; so she whipped a quilt from the bed and flung it round
8443,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"Mary’s head, and thus stifled the flame."
8444,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8445,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ Mary was a good deal scorched, though."
8446,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8447,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Yes—but it was very well that it was no worse. If the maid,"
8448,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"however, had acted with any sense at first, no harm would have been"
8449,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"done, except burning the cap. I remember a much more fatal example of"
8450,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,the want of presence of mind. The mistress of a family was awakened by
8451,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,flames bursting through the wainscot into her chamber. She flew to the
8452,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"staircase; and in her confusion, instead of going upstairs to call her"
8453,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"children, who slept together in the nursery overhead, and who might all"
8454,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"have escaped by the top of the house, she ran down, and with much danger"
8455,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"made way through the fire, into the street. When she had got thither,"
8456,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"the thought of her poor children rushed into her mind, but it was too"
8457,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"late. The stairs had caught fire, so that nobody could get near them,"
8458,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,and they were burnt in their beds.
8459,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8460,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ What a sad thing!
8461,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8462,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Sad, indeed! Now, I will tell you of a different conduct. A"
8463,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"lady was awakened by the crackling of fire, and saw it shining under her"
8464,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"chamber-door. Her husband would have immediately opened the door, but"
8465,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"she prevented him, since the smoke and flame would then have burst in"
8466,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,upon them.
8467,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8468,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,The children with a maid slept in a room opening out of theirs. She went
8469,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"and awakened them; and tying together the sheets and blankets, she sent"
8470,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"down the maid from the window first, and then let down the children one"
8471,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"by one to her. Last of all she descended herself. A few minutes after,"
8472,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"the floor fell in, and all the house was in flames."
8473,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8474,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ What a happy escape!
8475,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8476,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ Yes—and with what cool recollection of mind it was managed!
8477,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"For mothers to love their children, and be willing to run any hazards"
8478,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"for them, is common; but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent"
8479,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,exertions in the time of danger. I knew a lady who had a fine little boy
8480,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"sitting in her lap. He put a whole plum into his mouth, which slipped"
8481,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"into his throat and choked him. The poor fellow turned black, and"
8482,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"struggled violently; and the mother was so frightened, that instead of"
8483,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"putting her finger in his throat, and pulling out the plum, which might"
8484,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"easily have been done, she laid him on the floor, and ran to call for"
8485,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,assistance. But the maids who came up were as much flurried as she; and
8486,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,the child died before anything effectual was done to relieve him.
8487,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8488,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ How unhappy she must have been about it!
8489,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8490,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ Yes. It threw her into an illness which had liked to have cost
8491,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,her her life.
8492,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8493,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"Another lady, seeing her little boy climb up a high ladder, set up a"
8494,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"violent scream that frightened the child, so that he fell down and was"
8495,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"much hurt; whereas, if she had possessed command enough over herself to"
8496,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"speak to him gently, he might have got down safely."
8497,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8498,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ Dear mamma! what is that running down your arm?—O, it is blood!"
8499,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8500,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ Yes—my arm bleeds again. I have stirred it too soon.
8501,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8502,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ Dear! What shall I do?
8503,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8504,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ Don’t frighten yourself. I shall stop the blood by pressing on
8505,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"the orifice with my finger. In the meantime, do you ring the bell."
8506,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8507,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,[_Eliza rings—a servant comes._
8508,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8509,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Betty, my arm bleeds. Can you tie it up again?"
8510,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8511,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Betty._ I believe I can, madam."
8512,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8513,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,[_She takes off the bandage and puts on another._
8514,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8515,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ I hope it is stopped now?
8516,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8517,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ It is. Betty has done it very well. You see she went about it
8518,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,with composure. This accident puts me in mind of another story which is
8519,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"very well worth hearing. A man once reaping in the field, cut his arm"
8520,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"dreadfully with his sickle, and divided an artery."
8521,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8522,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ What is that, mamma?"
8523,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8524,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ It is one of the canals or pipes through which the blood from
8525,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,the heart runs like water in a pipe brought from a reservoir. When one
8526,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"of these is cut it bleeds very violently, and the only way to stop it is"
8527,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"to make a pressure between the wounded place and the heart, in order to"
8528,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,intercept the course of the blood toward it. Well—this poor man bled
8529,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"profusely; and the people about him, both men and women, were so"
8530,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"stupified with fright, that some ran one way, some another, and some"
8531,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"stood stock still. In short, he would have soon bled to death, had not a"
8532,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"brisk stout-hearted wench, who came up, slipped off her garter, and"
8533,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"bound it tight above the wound, by which means the bleeding was stopped"
8534,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,till proper help could be procured.
8535,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8536,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ What a clever wench! But how did she know what to do?
8537,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8538,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ She had perhaps heard it, as you have done now; and so"
8539,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"probably had some of the others, but they had not presence of mind"
8540,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"enough to put it into practice. It is a much greater trial of courage,"
8541,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"however, when the danger presses upon ourselves as well as others."
8542,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,Suppose a furious bull was to come upon you in the midst of a field. You
8543,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"could not possibly escape him by running, and attempting it would"
8544,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,destroy your only chance of safety.
8545,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8546,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ What would that be?
8547,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8548,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ I have a story for that, too. The mother of that Mr. Day, who"
8549,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"wrote _Sandford and Merton_, was distinguished, as he also was, for"
8550,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"courage and presence of mind. When a young woman, she was one day"
8551,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"walking in the fields with a companion, when they perceived a bull"
8552,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"coming to them, roaring and tossing about his head in the most"
8553,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,tremendous manner.
8554,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8555,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ O, how I should have screamed!"
8556,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8557,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ I dare say you would; and so did her companion. But she bid
8558,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"her walk away behind her as gently as she could, while she herself"
8559,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"stopped short, and faced the bull, eying him with a determined"
8560,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"countenance. The bull, when he had come near, stopped also, pawing the"
8561,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,ground and roaring. Few animals will attack a man who steadily waits for
8562,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"him. In a while, she drew back some steps, still facing the bull. The"
8563,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"bull followed. She stopped, and then he stopped. In this manner, she"
8564,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,made good her retreat to the stile over which her companion had before
8565,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,got. She then turned and sprung over it; and got clear out of danger.
8566,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8567,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Eliz._ That was bravely done, indeed! But I think very few women could"
8568,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,have done as much.
8569,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8570,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Such a degree of cool resolution, to be sure, is not common."
8571,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,But I have read of a lady in the East Indies who showed at least as
8572,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"much. She was sitting out of doors with a party of pleasure, when they"
8573,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"were aware of a huge tiger that had crept through a hedge near them, and"
8574,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,was just ready to make his fatal spring. They were struck with the
8575,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"utmost consternation; but she, with an umbrella in her hand, turned to"
8576,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"the tiger, and suddenly spread it full in his face. This unusual assault"
8577,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"so terrified the beast, that, taking a prodigious leap, he sprung over"
8578,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"the fence, and plunged out of sight into the neighbouring thicket."
8579,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8580,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ Well—that was the boldest thing I ever heard of! But is it
8581,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"possible, mamma, to make one’s self courageous?"
8582,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8583,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Courage, my dear, is of two kinds; one the gift of nature, the"
8584,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,other of reason and habit. Men have naturally more courage than women;
8585,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"that is, they are less affected by danger; it makes a less impression"
8586,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"upon them, and does not flutter their spirits so much. This is owing to"
8587,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,the difference of their bodily constitution; and from the same cause
8588,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,some men and some women are more courageous than others. But the other
8589,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,kind of courage may in some measure be acquired by every one. Reason
8590,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"teaches us to face smaller dangers in order to avoid greater, and even"
8591,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,to undergo the greatest when our duty requires it. Habit makes us less
8592,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,affected by particular dangers which have often come in our way. A
8593,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"sailor does not feel the danger of a storm so much as a landsman, but if"
8594,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"he was mounted upon a spirited horse in a fox-chase, he would probably"
8595,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,be the most timorous man in company. The courage of women is chiefly
8596,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,tried in domestic dangers. They are attendants on the sick and dying;
8597,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,and they must qualify themselves to go through many scenes of terror in
8598,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"these situations, which would alarm the stoutest-hearted man who was not"
8599,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,accustomed to them.
8600,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8601,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ I have heard that women generally bear pain and illness better
8602,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,than men.
8603,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8604,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ They do so, because they are more used to them, both in"
8605,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,themselves and others.
8606,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8607,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ I think I should not be afraid again to see anybody blooded.
8608,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8609,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Mrs. F._ I hope not. It was for that purpose I made you stand by me.
8610,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,And I would have you always force yourself to look on and give
8611,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"assistance in cases of this kind, however painful it may at first be to"
8612,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"you, that you may as soon as possible gain that presence of mind which"
8613,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,arises from habit.
8614,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8615,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,_Eliz._ But would that make me like to be blooded myself?
8616,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,
8617,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,"_Mrs. F._ Not to _like_ it, but to lose all foolish fears about it, and"
8618,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,submit calmly to it when good for you. But I hope you have sense enough
8619,ON PRESENCE OF MIND.,to do that already.

8837,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.
8838,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8839,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8840,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"“Papa,” said Lucy, “I have been reading to-day, that Sir Isaac Newton"
8841,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,was led to make some of his great discoveries by seeing an apple fall
8842,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,from a tree. What was there extraordinary in that?”
8843,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8844,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Papa._ There was nothing extraordinary; but it happened to catch his
8845,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"attention, and set him to thinking."
8846,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8847,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lucy._ And what did he think about?
8848,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8849,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ He thought by what means the apple was brought to the ground.
8850,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8851,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ Why, I could have told him that—because the stalk gave way, and"
8852,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,there was nothing to support it.
8853,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8854,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ And what then?
8855,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8856,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ Why, then it must fall, you know."
8857,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8858,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ But why _must_ it fall?—that is the point.
8859,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8860,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ Because it could not help it.
8861,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8862,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ But why could it not help it?
8863,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8864,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ I don’t know—that is an odd question. Because there was nothing to
8865,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,keep it up.
8866,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8867,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ Suppose there was not—does it follow that it must come to the
8868,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,ground?
8869,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8870,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ Yes, surely!"
8871,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8872,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ Is an apple animate or inanimate?
8873,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8874,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ Inanimate, to be sure!"
8875,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8876,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ And can inanimate things move of themselves?
8877,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8878,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ No—I think not—but the apple falls because it is forced to fall.
8879,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8880,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Right! Some force out of itself acts upon it, otherwise it would"
8881,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"remain for ever where it was, notwithstanding it were loosened from the"
8882,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,tree.
8883,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8884,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ Would it?
8885,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8886,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ Undoubtedly! for there only two ways in which it could be moved;
8887,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"by its own power of motion, or the power of something else moving it."
8888,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,Now the first you acknowledge it has not; the cause of its motion must
8889,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,therefore be the second. And what that is was the subject of the
8890,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,philosopher’s inquiry.
8891,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8892,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ But everything falls to the ground as well as an apple, when there"
8893,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,is nothing to keep it up.
8894,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8895,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ True—there must therefore be a universal cause of this tendency to
8896,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,fall.
8897,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8898,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ And what is it?
8899,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8900,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Why, if things out of the earth cannot move themselves to it,"
8901,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,there can be no other cause of their coming together than that the earth
8902,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,pulls them.
8903,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8904,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ But the earth is no more animate than they are: so how can it
8905,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,pull?
8906,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8907,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Well objected! This will bring us to the point. Sir Isaac Newton,"
8908,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"after deep meditation, discovered, that there was a law in nature called"
8909,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_attraction_, by virtue of which every particle of matter, that is,"
8910,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"everything of which the world is composed, draws toward it every other"
8911,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"particle of matter, with a force proportioned to its size and distance."
8912,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"Lay two marbles on the table. They have a tendency to come together, and"
8913,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"if there were nothing else in the world they would come together, but"
8914,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"they are also attracted by the table, by the ground, and by everything"
8915,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,besides in the room; and these different attractions pull against each
8916,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"other. Now, the globe of the earth is a prodigious mass of matter, to"
8917,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"which nothing near it can bear any comparison. It draws, therefore, with"
8918,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"mighty force, everything within its reach, which is the cause of their"
8919,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"falling: and this is called the _gravitation_ of bodies, or what gives"
8920,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"them _weight_. When I lift anything, I act contrary to this force, for"
8921,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"which reason it seems _heavy_ to me, and the heavier the more matter it"
8922,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"contains, since that increases the attraction of the earth for it. Do"
8923,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,you understand this?
8924,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8925,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ I think I do. It is like a loadstone drawing a needle.
8926,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8927,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Yes; that is an attraction, but of a particular kind, only taking"
8928,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"place between the magnet and iron. But gravitation, or the attraction of"
8929,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"the earth, acts upon everything alike."
8930,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8931,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ Then it is pulling you and me at this moment.
8932,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8933,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ It is.
8934,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8935,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ But why do not we stick to the ground, then?"
8936,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8937,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Because, as we are alive, we have a power of self-motion, which"
8938,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"can, to a certain degree, overcome the attraction of the earth. But the"
8939,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"reason you cannot jump a mile high as well as a foot, is this"
8940,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"attraction, which limits the force of your jump, and brings you down"
8941,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,again after that force is spent.
8942,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8943,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ I think, then, I begin to understand what I have heard of people"
8944,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,living on the other side of the world. I believe they are called
8945,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_antipodes_, who have their feet turned toward ours, and their heads in"
8946,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,the air. I used to wonder how it could be that they did not fall off;
8947,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,but I suppose the earth pulls them to it.
8948,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8949,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ Very true. And whither should they fall? What have they over their
8950,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,heads?
8951,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8952,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ I don’t know; sky, I suppose."
8953,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8954,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ They have. This earth is a vast ball, hung in the air, and"
8955,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"continually spinning round, and that is the cause why the sun and stars"
8956,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"seem to rise and set. At noon we have the sun over our heads, when the"
8957,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,antipodes have the stars over theirs; and at midnight the stars are over
8958,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"our heads, and the sun over theirs. So whither should they fall to more"
8959,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,than we?—to the stars or the sun?
8960,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8961,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ But we are up, and they are down."
8962,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8963,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ What is up, but _from_ the earth and _toward_ the sky? Their feet"
8964,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"touch the earth, and their heads point to the sky, as well as ours; and"
8965,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"we are under their feet, as much as they are under ours. If a hole were"
8966,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"dug quite through the earth, what would you see through it?"
8967,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8968,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ Sky, with the sun or the stars; and now I see the whole matter"
8969,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,plainly. But pray what supports the earth in the air?
8970,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8971,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ Why, whither should it go?"
8972,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8973,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Lu._ I don’t know—I suppose where there was most to draw it. I have
8974,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,heard that the sun is a great many times bigger than the earth. Would it
8975,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,not go to that?
8976,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8977,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Pa._ You have thought very justly on the matter, I perceive. But I"
8978,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"shall take another opportunity of showing you how this is, and why the"
8979,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"earth does not fall into the sun, of which, I confess, there seems to be"
8980,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"some danger. Meanwhile, think how far the falling of an apple has"
8981,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,carried us?
8982,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8983,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,"_Lu._ To the antipodes, and I know not where."
8984,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,
8985,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,_Pa._ You may see thence what use may be made of the commonest fact by a
8986,WHY AN APPLE FALLS.,thinking mind.

8993,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,
8994,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,Nature and Education were one day walking together through a nursery of

8996,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"is my doing! but as to those oaks, they are all crooked and stunted:"
8997,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"that, my good sister, is your fault. You have planted them too close,"
8998,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"and not pruned them properly.”—“Nay, sister,” said Education, “I am sure"
8999,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"I have taken all possible pains about them; but you gave me bad acorns,"
9000,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,so how should they ever make fine trees?”
9001,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,
9002,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"The dispute grew warm; and, at length, instead of blaming one another"
9003,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"for negligence, they began to boast of their own powers, and to"
9004,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,challenge each other to a contest for the superiority. It was agreed
9005,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"that each should adopt a favourite, and rear it up in spite of the ill"
9006,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,offices of her opponent. Nature fixed upon a vigorous young Weymouth
9007,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"pine, the parent of which had grown to be the mainmast of a man-of-war."
9008,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"“Do what you will to this plant,” said she to her sister, “I am resolved"
9009,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,to push it up as straight as an arrow.” Education took under her care a
9010,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"crab-tree. “This,” said she, “I will rear to be at least as valuable as"
9011,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,your pine.”
9012,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,
9013,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,Both went to work. While Nature was feeding her pine with plenty of
9014,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"wholesome juices, Education passed a strong rope round its top, and"
9015,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"pulling it downward with all its force, fastened it to the trunk of a"
9016,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"neighbouring oak. The pine laboured to ascend, but not being able to"
9017,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"surmount the obstacle, it pushed out to one side, and presently became"
9018,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"bent like a bow. Still, such was its vigour, that its top, after"
9019,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"descending as low as its branches, made a new shoot upward: but its"
9020,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,beauty and usefulness were quite destroyed.
9021,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,
9022,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"The crab-tree cost Education a world of pains. She pruned and pruned,"
9023,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"and endeavoured to bring it into shape, but in vain. Nature thrust out a"
9024,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"bough this way, and a knot that way, and would not push a single leading"
9025,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"shoot upward. The trunk was, indeed, kept tolerably straight by constant"
9026,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"efforts; but the head grew awry and ill-fashioned, and made a scrubby"
9027,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"figure. At length, Education, despairing of making a sightly plant of"
9028,NATURE AND EDUCATION.—A FABLE.,"it, ingrafted the stock with an apple, and brought it to bear tolerable"

9046,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9047,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Belford._ Pray, who is the present possessor of the Brookby estate?"
9048,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9049,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arbury._ A man of the name of Goodwin.
9050,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9051,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Is he a good neighbour to you?
9052,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9053,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Far from it! and I wish he had settled a hundred miles off,"
9054,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,rather than come here to spoil our neighbourhood.
9055,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9056,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ I am sorry to hear that; but what is your objection to him?
9057,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9058,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ O, there is nothing in which we agree. In the first place he is"
9059,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"quite of the other side in politics; and that, you know, is enough to"
9060,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,prevent all intimacy.
9061,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9062,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ I am not entirely of that opinion; but what else?
9063,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9064,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ He is no sportsman, and refuses to join in our association for"
9065,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,protecting the game. Neither does he choose to be a member of any of our
9066,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,clubs.
9067,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9068,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Has he been asked?
9069,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9070,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ I don’t know that he has directly; but he might easily propose
9071,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"himself, if he liked it. But he is of a close, unsociable temper, and I"
9072,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,believe very niggardly.
9073,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9074,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ How has he shown it?
9075,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9076,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ His style of living is not equal to his fortune; and I have heard
9077,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,of several instances of his attention to petty economy.
9078,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9079,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Perhaps he spends money in charity?
9080,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9081,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Not he, I dare say. It was but last week that a poor fellow who"
9082,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"had lost his all by a fire went to him with a subscription paper, in"
9083,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,which were the names of all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood; and all
9084,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,the answer he got was that he would consider of it.
9085,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9086,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ And did he consider?
9087,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9088,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ I don’t know, but I suppose it was only an excuse. Then his"
9089,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"predecessor had a park well stocked with deer, and used to make liberal"
9090,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,presents of venison to all his neighbours. But this frugal gentleman has
9091,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"sold them all off, and got a flock of sheep instead."
9092,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9093,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ I don’t see much harm in that, now mutton is so dear."
9094,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9095,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ To be sure he has a right to do as he pleases with his park, but"
9096,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"that is not the way to be beloved, you know. As to myself, I have reason"
9097,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,to believe he bears me particular ill-will.
9098,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9099,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Then he is much in the wrong, for I believe you are as free from"
9100,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"ill-will to others as any man living. But how has he shown it, pray?"
9101,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9102,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ In twenty instances. He had a horse upon sale the other day to
9103,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"which I took a liking, and bid money for it. As soon as he found I was"
9104,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"about it, he sent it off to a fair on the other side of the county. My"
9105,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"wife, you know, is passionately fond of cultivating flowers. Riding"
9106,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"lately by his grounds, she observed something new, and took a great"
9107,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,longing for a root or cutting of it. My gardener mentioned her wish to
9108,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"his, (contrary, I own, to my inclination,) and he told his master; but"
9109,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"instead of obliging her, he charged the gardener on no account to touch"
9110,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,the plant. A little while ago I turned off a man for saucy behaviour;
9111,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"but as he had lived many years with me, and was a very useful servant, I"
9112,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"meant to take him again upon his submission, which I did not doubt would"
9113,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"soon happen. Instead of that, he goes and offers himself to my civil"
9114,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"neighbour, who, without deigning to apply to me even for a character,"
9115,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"entertains him immediately. In short, he has not the least of a"
9116,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"gentleman about him, and I would give anything to be well rid of him."
9117,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9118,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Nothing, to be sure, can be more unpleasant, in the country, than"
9119,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"a bad neighbour, and I am concerned it is your lot to have one. But"
9120,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,there is a man who seems as if he wanted to speak with you.
9121,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9122,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,[_A Countryman approaches._
9123,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9124,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Ah! it is the poor fellow that was burnt out. Well, Richard, how"
9125,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,go you on?—what has the subscription produced you?
9126,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9127,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Richard._ Thank your honour, my losses are nearly all made up."
9128,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9129,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ I am very glad of that; but when I saw the paper last, it did not"
9130,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,reach half way.
9131,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9132,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Rich._ It did not, sir; but you may remember asking me what Mr. Goodwin"
9133,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"had done for me, and I told you he took time to consider of it. Well,"
9134,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"sir, I found that the very next day he had been at our town, and had"
9135,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"made very particular inquiry about me and my losses, among my"
9136,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"neighbours. When I called upon him in a few days after, he told me he"
9137,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"was very glad to find that I bore such a good character, and that the"
9138,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,gentlemen round had so kindly taken up my case; and he would prevent the
9139,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"necessity of my going any farther for relief. Upon which, he gave me,"
9140,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,God bless him! a draft upon his banker for fifty pounds.
9141,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9142,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Fifty pounds!
9143,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9144,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Rich._ Yes, sir—it has made me quite my own man again; and I am now"
9145,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,going to purchase a new cart and team of horses.
9146,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9147,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ A noble gift, indeed; I could never have thought it! Well,"
9148,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"Richard, I rejoice at your good fortune. I am sure you are much obliged"
9149,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,to Mr. Goodwin.
9150,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9151,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Rich._ Indeed, I am, sir, and to all my good friends. God bless you!"
9152,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9153,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,[_Goes on._
9154,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9155,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Niggardliness, at least, is not this man’s foible."
9156,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9157,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ No—I was mistaken in that point. I wronged him, and I am sorry"
9158,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,for it. But what a pity it is that men of real generosity should not be
9159,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"amiable in their manners, and as ready to oblige in trifles as in"
9160,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,matters of consequence.
9161,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9162,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ True—‘tis a pity when that is really the case.
9163,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9164,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ How much less an exertion it would have been to have shown some
9165,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,civility about a horse or a flower-root!
9166,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9167,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Apropos of flowers!—there’s your gardener carrying a large one in
9168,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,a pot.
9169,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9170,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Enter Gardener._
9171,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9172,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Now, James, what have you got there?"
9173,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9174,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Gardener._ A flower, sir, for madam, from Mr. Goodwin’s."
9175,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9176,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ How did you come by it?
9177,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9178,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Gard._ His gardener, sir, sent me word to come for it. We should have"
9179,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"had it before, but Mr. Goodwin thought it would not move safely."
9180,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9181,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ I hope he has got more of them?
9182,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9183,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Gard._ He has only a seedling plant or two, sir; but hearing that madam"
9184,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"took a liking to it, he resolved to send it her, and a choice thing it"
9185,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,is! I have a note for madam in my pocket.
9186,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9187,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Well, go on."
9188,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9189,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,[_Exit Gardener._
9190,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9191,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Methinks this does not look like deficiency in civility?
9192,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9193,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ No—it is a very polite action—I ca’n’t deny it, and I am obliged"
9194,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"to him for it. Perhaps, indeed, he may feel he owes me a little amends."
9195,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9196,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Possibly—it shows he _can_ feel, however."
9197,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9198,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ It does. Ha! there’s Yorkshire Tom coming with a string of horses
9199,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"from the fair. I’ll step up and speak to him. Now, Tom! how have horses"
9200,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,gone at Market-hill?
9201,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9202,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Tom._ Dear enough, your honour!"
9203,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9204,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ How much more did you get for Mr. Goodwin’s mare than I offered
9205,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,him?
9206,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9207,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Tom._ Ah! sir, that was not a thing for your riding, and that Mr"
9208,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,Goodwin well knew. You never saw such a vicious toad. She had liked to
9209,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,have killed the groom two or three times. So I was ordered to offer her
9210,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"to the mail-coach people, and get what I could from them. I might have"
9211,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"sold her better if Mr. Goodwin would have let me, for she was a fine"
9212,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"creature to look at as need be, and quite sound."
9213,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9214,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ And was that the true reason why the mare was not sold to me?
9215,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9216,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Tom._ It was, indeed, sir."
9217,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9218,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Then I am highly obliged to Mr. Goodwin. (_Tom rides on._) This
9219,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"was handsome behaviour, indeed!"
9220,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9221,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Yes, I think it was somewhat more than politeness—it was real"
9222,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,goodness of heart.
9223,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9224,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ It was. I find I must alter my opinion of him, and I do it with"
9225,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"pleasure. But, after all, his conduct with respect to my servant is"
9226,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,somewhat unaccountable.
9227,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9228,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ I see reason to think so well of him in the main, that I am"
9229,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"inclined to hope he will be acquitted in this matter, too."
9230,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9231,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ There the fellow is. I wonder he has my old livery on yet!
9232,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9233,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"[_Ned approaches, pulling off his hat._"
9234,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9235,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Ned._ Sir, I was coming to your honour."
9236,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9237,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ What can you have to say to me now, Ned?"
9238,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9239,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Ned._ To ask pardon for my misbehaviour, and to beg you to take me"
9240,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,again.
9241,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9242,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ What—have you so soon parted with your new master?
9243,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9244,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Ned._ Mr. Goodwin never was my master, sir. He only kept me in his"
9245,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,house till I could make it up with you again; for he said he was sure
9246,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,you were too honourable a gentleman to turn off an old servant without
9247,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"good reason, and he hoped you would admit my excuses after your anger"
9248,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,was over.
9249,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9250,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Did he say all that?
9251,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9252,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Ned._ Yes, sir; and he advised me not to delay any longer to ask your"
9253,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,pardon.
9254,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9255,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Well—go to my house, and I will talk with you on my return."
9256,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9257,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Now, my friend, what think you of this?"
9258,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9259,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ I think more than I can well express. It will be a lesson to me
9260,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,never to make hasty judgments again.
9261,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9262,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Why, indeed, to have concluded that such a man had nothing of the"
9263,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,gentleman about him must have been rather hasty.
9264,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9265,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ I acknowledge it. But it is the misfortune of these reserved
9266,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"characters that they are so long in making themselves known; though,"
9267,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"when they are known, they often prove the most truly estimable. I am"
9268,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"afraid, even now, that I must be content with esteeming him at a"
9269,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,distance.
9270,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9271,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Why so?
9272,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9273,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ You know I am of an open sociable disposition.
9274,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9275,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ Perhaps he is so, too."
9276,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9277,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ If he was, surely we should have been better acquainted before"
9278,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,this time.
9279,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9280,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ It may have been prejudice rather than temper that has kept you
9281,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,apart.
9282,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9283,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Possibly so. The vile spirit of party has such a sway in the
9284,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"country, that men of the most liberal dispositions can hardly free"
9285,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,themselves from its influence. It poisons all the kindness of society;
9286,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,and yonder comes an instance of its pernicious effects.
9287,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9288,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Who is he?
9289,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9290,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ A poor schoolmaster with a large family in the next market-town,"
9291,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,who has lost all his scholars by his activity on our side in the last
9292,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,election. I heartily wish it was in my power to do something for him;
9293,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"for he is a very honest man, though, perhaps, rather too warm. [_The"
9294,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"schoolmaster comes up._] Now, Mr. Penman, how do things go with you?"
9295,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9296,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ I thank you, sir, they have gone poorly enough, but I hope they"
9297,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,are in a way to mend.
9298,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9299,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ I am glad to hear it—but how?
9300,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9301,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ Why, sir, the free-school of Stoke is vacant, and I believe I am"
9302,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,likely to get it.
9303,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9304,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Ay!—I wonder at that. I thought it was in the hands of the other
9305,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,party?
9306,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9307,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ It is, sir; but Mr. Goodwin has been so kind as to give me a"
9308,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"recommendation, and his interest is sufficient to carry it."
9309,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9310,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Mr. Goodwin! you surprise me!
9311,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9312,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ I was much surprised, too, sir. He sent for me of his own accord,"
9313,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"(for I should never have thought of asking _him_ a favour,) and told me"
9314,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,he was sorry a man should be injured in his profession on account of
9315,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"party, and as I could not live comfortably where I was, he would try to"
9316,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"settle me in a better place. So he mentioned the vacancy of Stoke, and"
9317,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"offered me letters for the trustees. I was never so affected in my life,"
9318,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"sir; I could hardly speak to return him thanks. He kept me to dinner,"
9319,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"and treated me with the greatest respect. Indeed, I believe there is not"
9320,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,a kinder man breathing than Mr. Goodwin.
9321,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9322,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ You have the best reason in the world to say so, Mr. Penman."
9323,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,What—did he converse familiarly with you?
9324,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9325,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ Quite so, sir. We talked a great deal about party affairs in this"
9326,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"neighbourhood, and he lamented much that differences of this kind should"
9327,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"keep worthy men at a distance from each other. I took the liberty, sir,"
9328,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,of mentioning your name. He said he had not the honour of being
9329,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"acquainted with you, but he had a sincere esteem for your character, and"
9330,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,should be glad of any occasion to cultivate a friendship with you. For
9331,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"my part, I confess, to my shame I did not think there could have been"
9332,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,such a man on that side.
9333,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9334,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Arb._ Well—good morning!
9335,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9336,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Pen._ Your most obedient, sir."
9337,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9338,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,[_He goes._
9339,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9340,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ (_After some silence._) Come, my friend, let us go."
9341,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9342,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Whither?
9343,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9344,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ Can you doubt it?—to Mr. Goodwin’s, to be sure! After all I have"
9345,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"heard, can I exist a moment without acknowledging the injustice I have"
9346,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"done him, and begging his friendship?"
9347,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9348,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Bel._ I shall be happy, I am sure, to accompany you on that errand. But"
9349,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,who is to introduce us?
9350,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9351,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,"_Arb._ O, what are form and ceremony in a case like this! Come—come."
9352,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,
9353,AVERSION SUBDUED.—A DRAMA.,_Bel._ Most willingly.

9366,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9367,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9368,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"Mr. L. was one morning riding by himself, when dismounting to gather a"
9369,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"plant in the hedge, his horse got loose and galloped away before him. He"
9370,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"followed, calling the horse by his name, which stopped, but on his"
9371,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"approach set off again. At length, a little boy in a neighbouring field,"
9372,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"seeing the affair, ran across where the road made a turn, and getting"
9373,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"before the horse, took him by the bridle, and held him till his owner"
9374,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"came up. Mr. L. looked at the boy, and admired his ruddy, cheerful"
9375,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,countenance.
9376,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9377,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"“Thank you, my good lad!” said he; “you have caught my horse very"
9378,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,cleverly. What shall I give you for your trouble?” putting his hand in
9379,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,his pocket.
9380,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9381,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ I want nothing, sir."
9382,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9383,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Don’t you? so much the better for you. Few men can say as much.
9384,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"But pray, what are you doing in the field?"
9385,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9386,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I was rooting up weeds and tending the sheep that are feeding on
9387,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,the turnips.
9388,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9389,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ And do you like this employment?
9390,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9391,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Yes, very well, this fine weather."
9392,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9393,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ But had you not rather play?
9394,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9395,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ This is not hard work; it is almost as good as play.
9396,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9397,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Who set you to work?
9398,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9399,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ My daddy, sir."
9400,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9401,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Where does he live?
9402,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9403,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Just by, among the trees there."
9404,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9405,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ What is his name?
9406,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9407,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Thomas Hurdle.
9408,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9409,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ And what is yours?
9410,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9411,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Peter, sir."
9412,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9413,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ How old are you?
9414,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9415,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I shall be eight at Michaelmas.
9416,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9417,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ How long have you been out in this field?
9418,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9419,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Ever since six in the morning.
9420,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9421,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ And are not you hungry?
9422,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9423,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Yes—I shall go to dinner soon.
9424,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9425,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ If you had sixpence now, what would you do with it?"
9426,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9427,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I don’t know. I never had so much in my life.
9428,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9429,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Have you no playthings?
9430,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9431,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Playthings! what are those?
9432,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9433,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Such as balls, nine-pins, marbles, tops, and wooden horses."
9434,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9435,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ No, sir; but our Tom makes footballs to kick in the cold weather,"
9436,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,and we set traps for birds; and then I have a jumping-pole and a pair of
9437,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"stilts to walk through the dirt with; and I had a hoop, but it is broke."
9438,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9439,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ And do you want nothing else?
9440,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9441,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ No. I have hardly time for those: for I always ride the horses to
9442,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"field, and bring up the cows, and run to the town of errands, and that"
9443,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"is as good as play, you know."
9444,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9445,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Well, but you could buy apples or gingerbread at the town, I"
9446,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"suppose, if you had money?"
9447,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9448,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Oh—I can get apples at home; and as for gingerbread I don’t mind
9449,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"it much, for my mammy gives me a pie now and then, and that is as good."
9450,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9451,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Would you not like a knife to cut sticks?
9452,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9453,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I have one—here it is—brother Tom gave it me.
9454,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9455,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Your shoes are full of holes—don’t you want a better pair?
9456,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9457,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I have a better pair for Sundays.
9458,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9459,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ But these let in water.
9460,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9461,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Oh, I don’t care for that."
9462,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9463,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Your hat is all torn, too."
9464,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9465,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ I have a better at home, but I had as leave have none at all, for"
9466,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,it hurts my head.
9467,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9468,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ What do you do when it rains?
9469,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9470,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ If it rains very hard, I get under the hedges till it is over."
9471,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9472,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ What do you do when you are hungry before it is time to go
9473,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,home?
9474,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9475,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ I sometimes eat a raw turnip.
9476,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9477,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ But if there are none?
9478,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9479,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Then I do as well as I can; I work on, and never think of it."
9480,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9481,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ Are you not dry sometimes this hot weather?
9482,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9483,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Yes, but there is water enough."
9484,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9485,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Why, my little fellow, you are quite a philosopher!"
9486,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9487,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Boy._ Sir?
9488,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9489,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ I say you are a philosopher, but I am sure you do not know what"
9490,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,that means.
9491,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9492,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ No, sir, no harm, I hope."
9493,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9494,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ No, no! (_Laughing._) Well, my boy, you seem to want nothing at"
9495,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"all, so I shall not give you money to make you want anything. But were"
9496,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,you ever at school?
9497,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9498,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ No, sir, but daddy says I shall go after harvest."
9499,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9500,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,_Mr. L._ You will want books then.
9501,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9502,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ Yes, the boys have all a spelling-book and a testament."
9503,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9504,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Well, then, I will give you them—tell your daddy so, and that"
9505,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,it is because I think you a very good contented little boy. So now go to
9506,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,your sheep again.
9507,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9508,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Boy._ I will, sir. Thank you."
9509,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,
9510,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,"_Mr. L._ Good-by, Peter."
9511,THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.,

9520,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"“Pray, papa,” said Sophia after she had been a long time teased with the"
9521,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"flies that buzzed about her ears, and settled on her nose and forehead"
9522,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"as she sat at work—“Pray, what were flies made for?”"
9523,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9524,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"“For some good, I dare say,” replied her papa."
9525,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9526,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Sop._ But I think they do a great deal more harm than good, for I am"
9527,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"sure they plague me sadly: and in the kitchen they are so troublesome,"
9528,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,that the maids can hardly do their work for them.
9529,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9530,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ Flies eat up many things that would otherwise corrupt and become
9531,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"loathsome; and they serve for food to birds, spiders, and many other"
9532,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,animals.
9533,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9534,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ But we could clean away everything that was offensive without
9535,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"their help; and as to their serving for food, I have seen whole heaps of"
9536,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"them lying dead in a window, without seeming to have done good to"
9537,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,anything.
9538,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9539,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Pa._ Well, then. Suppose a fly capable of thinking; would he not be"
9540,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,equally puzzled to find out what men were good for? “This great
9541,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"two-legged monster,” he might say, “instead of helping us to live,"
9542,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,devours more food at a meal than would serve a whole legion of flies.
9543,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"Then he kills us by hundreds when we come within his reach, and I see"
9544,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,him destroy and torment all other animals too. And when he dies he is
9545,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"nailed up in a box, and put a great way under ground, as if he grudged"
9546,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,doing any more good after his death than when alive.” Now what would you
9547,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,answer to such a reasoning fly?
9548,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9549,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ I would tell him he was very impertinent for talking so of his
9550,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,betters; for that he and all other creatures were made for the use of
9551,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"man, and not man for theirs."
9552,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9553,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ But would you tell him true? You have just been saying that you
9554,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"could not find out of what use flies were to us: whereas, when they suck"
9555,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"our blood, there is no doubt that we are of use to them."
9556,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9557,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ It is that which puzzles me.
9558,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9559,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Pa._ There are many other animals which we call _noxious_, and which"
9560,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"are so far from being useful to us, that we take all possible pains to"
9561,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"get rid of them. More than that, there are vast tracks of the earth"
9562,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"where few or no men inhabit, which are yet full of beasts, birds,"
9563,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"insects, and all living things. These certainly do not exist there for"
9564,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"his use alone. On the contrary, they often keep man away."
9565,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9566,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ Then what are they made for?
9567,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9568,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ They are made to be happy. It is a manifest purpose of the Creator
9569,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"to give being to as much life as possible, for life is enjoyment to all"
9570,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,creatures in health and in possession of their faculties. Man surpasses
9571,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"other animals in his powers of enjoyment, and he has prospects in a"
9572,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,future state which they do not share with him. But the Creator equally
9573,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"desires the happiness of all his creatures, and looks down with as much"
9574,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"benignity upon these flies that are sporting around us, as upon"
9575,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,ourselves.
9576,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9577,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Sop._ Then we ought not to kill them, if they are ever so troublesome."
9578,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9579,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ I do not say that. We have a right to make a reasonable use of all
9580,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"animals for our advantage, and also to free ourselves from such as are"
9581,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,hurtful to us. So far our superiority over them may fairly extend. But
9582,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"we should never abuse them for our mere amusement, nor take away their"
9583,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"lives wantonly. Nay, a good natured-man will rather undergo a _little_"
9584,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"inconvenience, than take away from a creature all that it possesses. An"
9585,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"infant may destroy life, but all the kings upon earth cannot restore it."
9586,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,I remember reading of a good-tempered old gentleman that having been a
9587,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,long time plagued with a great fly that buzzed about his face all
9588,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"dinner-time, at length, after many efforts, caught it. Instead of"
9589,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"crushing it to death, he held it carefully in his hand, and opening the"
9590,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"window, “Go,” said he,—“get thee gone, poor creature, I won’t hurt a"
9591,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,hair of thy head; surely the world is wide enough for thee and me.”
9592,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9593,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ I should have loved that man.
9594,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9595,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ One of our poets has written some very pretty lines to a fly that
9596,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,came to partake with him of his wine. They begin:—
9597,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9598,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"“Busy, curious, thirsty fly,"
9599,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"Drink with me, and drink as I;"
9600,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"Welcome freely to my cup,"
9601,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,Couldst thou sip and sip it up.”
9602,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9603,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ How pretty! I think they will almost make me love flies. But
9604,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"pray, papa, do not animals destroy one another?"
9605,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9606,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Pa._ They do, indeed. The greatest part of them only live by the"
9607,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"destruction of life. There is a perpetual warfare going on, in which the"
9608,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"stronger prey upon the weaker, and, in their turns, are the prey of"
9609,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,those which are a degree stronger than themselves. Even the innocent
9610,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"sheep, with every mouthful of grass, destroys hundreds of small insects."
9611,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"In the air we breathe, and the water we drink, we give death to"
9612,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,thousands of invisible creatures.
9613,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9614,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ But is not that very strange? If they were created to live and be
9615,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"happy, why should they be destroyed so fast?"
9616,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9617,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ They are destroyed no faster than others are produced; and if they
9618,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"enjoyed life while it lasted, they have had a good bargain. By making"
9619,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"animals the food of animals, Providence has filled up every chink, as it"
9620,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"were, of existence. You see these swarms of flies. During all the hot"
9621,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,weather they are continually coming forth from the state of eggs and
9622,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"maggots, and as soon as they get the use of wings, they roam about and"
9623,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"fill every place in search of food. Meantime, they are giving sustenance"
9624,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"to the whole race of spiders; they maintain all the swallow tribe, and"
9625,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"contribute greatly to the support of many other small birds, and even"
9626,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"afford many a delicate morsel to the fishes. Their own numbers, however,"
9627,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"seem scarcely diminished, and vast multitudes live on till the cold"
9628,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"weather comes and puts an end to them. Were nothing to touch them, they"
9629,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"would probably become so numerous as to starve each other. As it is,"
9630,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"they are full of enjoyment themselves, and afford life and enjoyment to"
9631,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"other creatures, which in their turn supply the wants of others."
9632,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9633,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Sop._ It is no charity, then, to tear a spider’s web in pieces in order"
9634,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,to set the fly at liberty.
9635,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9636,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Pa._ None at all—no more than it would be to demolish the traps of a
9637,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,poor Indian hunter who depended upon them for his dinner. They both act
9638,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,as nature directs them. Shall I tell you a story?
9639,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9640,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,_Sop._ O yes—pray do!
9641,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,
9642,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"_Pa._ As a venerable Bramin, who had never in his days eaten anything"
9643,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"but rice, fruits, and milk, and held it the greatest of crimes to shed"
9644,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"the blood of anything that had life, was one day meditating on the banks"
9645,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"of the Ganges, he saw a little bird on the ground picking up ants as"
9646,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"fast as he could swallow. “Murderous wretch,” cried he, “what scores of"
9647,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"lives are sacrificed to one gluttonous meal of thine!” Presently, a"
9648,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"sparrow-hawk, pouncing down, seized him in his claws and flew off with"
9649,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,him. The Bramin was at first inclined to triumph over the little bird;
9650,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"but on hearing his cries, he could not help pitying him. “Poor thing,”"
9651,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"said he, “thou art fallen into the clutches of a tyrant!” A stronger"
9652,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"tyrant, however, took up the matter; for a falcon in mid air darting on"
9653,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"the sparrow-hawk, struck him to the ground, with the bird lifeless in"
9654,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"his talons. Tyrant against tyrant, thought the Bramin, is well enough."
9655,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"The falcon had not finished tearing his prey, when a lynx stealing from"
9656,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"behind a rock on which he was perched, sprung upon him, and having"
9657,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"strangled him, bore him to the edge of a neighbouring thicket, and began"
9658,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,to suck his blood. The Bramin was attentively viewing this new display
9659,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"of retributive justice, when a sudden roar shook the air, and a huge"
9660,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"tiger rushing from the thicket, came like thunder on the lynx. The"
9661,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"Bramin was near enough to hear the crushing bones, and was making off in"
9662,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"great terror, when he met an English soldier armed with his musket. He"
9663,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,pointed eagerly to the place where the tiger was making his bloody
9664,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"repast. The soldier levelled his gun, and laid the tiger dead. “Brave"
9665,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,"fellow!” exclaimed the Bramin. “I am very hungry,” said the soldier,"
9666,WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.,“can you give me a beefsteak? I see you have plenty of cows

9676,TRUE HEROISM.,"You have read, my Edmund, the stories of Achilles, and Alexander, and"
9677,TRUE HEROISM.,"Charles of Sweden, and have, I doubt not, admired the high courage which"
9678,TRUE HEROISM.,"seemed to set them above all sensations of fear, and rendered them"
9679,TRUE HEROISM.,capable of the most extraordinary actions. The world called these men
9680,TRUE HEROISM.,"_heroes_; but before we give them that noble appellation, let us"
9681,TRUE HEROISM.,consider what were the motives which animated them to act and suffer as
9682,TRUE HEROISM.,they did.
9683,TRUE HEROISM.,
9684,TRUE HEROISM.,"The first was a ferocious savage, governed by the passions of anger and"
9685,TRUE HEROISM.,"revenge, in gratifying which he disregarded all impulses of duty and"
9686,TRUE HEROISM.,humanity. The second was intoxicated with the love of glory—swollen with
9687,TRUE HEROISM.,absurd pride—and enslaved by dissolute pleasures; and in pursuit of
9688,TRUE HEROISM.,these objects he reckoned the blood of millions as of no account. The
9689,TRUE HEROISM.,"third was unfeeling, obstinate, and tyrannical, and preferred ruining"
9690,TRUE HEROISM.,"his country, and sacrificing all his faithful followers, to the"
9691,TRUE HEROISM.,"humiliation of giving up any of his mad projects. _Self_, you see, was"
9692,TRUE HEROISM.,the spring of all their conduct; and a selfish man can never be a hero.
9693,TRUE HEROISM.,"I will give you two examples of genuine heroism, one shown in acting,"
9694,TRUE HEROISM.,"the other in suffering; and these shall be _true stories_, which is"
9695,TRUE HEROISM.,perhaps more than can be said of half that is recorded of Achilles and
9696,TRUE HEROISM.,Alexander.
9697,TRUE HEROISM.,
9698,TRUE HEROISM.,"You have probably heard something of Mr. Howard, the reformer of"
9699,TRUE HEROISM.,"prisons, to whom a monument is erected in St. Paul’s church. His whole"
9700,TRUE HEROISM.,life almost was heroism; for he confronted all sorts of dangers with the
9701,TRUE HEROISM.,sole view of relieving the miseries of his fellow-creatures. When he
9702,TRUE HEROISM.,"began to examine the state of prisons, scarcely any in the country were"
9703,TRUE HEROISM.,free from a very fatal and infectious distemper called the jail fever.
9704,TRUE HEROISM.,"Wherever he heard of it, he made a point of seeing the poor sufferers,"
9705,TRUE HEROISM.,"and often went down into their dungeons, when the keepers themselves"
9706,TRUE HEROISM.,would not accompany him. He travelled several times over almost the
9707,TRUE HEROISM.,"whole of Europe, and even into Asia, in order to gain knowledge of the"
9708,TRUE HEROISM.,"state of prisons and hospitals, and point out means for lessening the"
9709,TRUE HEROISM.,calamities that prevail in them. He even went into countries where the
9710,TRUE HEROISM.,"plague was, that he might learn the best methods of treating that"
9711,TRUE HEROISM.,terrible contagious disease; and he voluntarily exposed himself to
9712,TRUE HEROISM.,"perform a strict quarantine, as one suspected of having the infection of"
9713,TRUE HEROISM.,"the plague, only that he might be thoroughly acquainted with the methods"
9714,TRUE HEROISM.,used for prevention. He at length died of a fever caught in attending on
9715,TRUE HEROISM.,"the sick on the borders of Crim Tartary, honoured and admired by all"
9716,TRUE HEROISM.,"Europe, after having greatly contributed to enlighten his own and many"
9717,TRUE HEROISM.,other countries with respect to some of the most important objects of
9718,TRUE HEROISM.,humanity. Such was _Howard the good_; as great a hero in preserving
9719,TRUE HEROISM.,"mankind, as some of the false heroes above mentioned were in destroying"
9720,TRUE HEROISM.,them.
9721,TRUE HEROISM.,
9722,TRUE HEROISM.,"My second hero is a much humbler, but not less genuine one."
9723,TRUE HEROISM.,
9724,TRUE HEROISM.,"There was a journeyman bricklayer in this town—an able workman, but a"
9725,TRUE HEROISM.,"very drunken idle fellow, who spent at the alehouse almost all he"
9726,TRUE HEROISM.,"earned, and left his wife and children to shift for themselves as they"
9727,TRUE HEROISM.,"could. This is, unfortunately, a common case; and of all the tyranny and"
9728,TRUE HEROISM.,"cruelty exercised in the world, I believe that of bad husbands and"
9729,TRUE HEROISM.,fathers is by much the most frequent and the worst.
9730,TRUE HEROISM.,
9731,TRUE HEROISM.,"The family might have starved, but for his eldest son, whom from a child"
9732,TRUE HEROISM.,the father brought up to help him in his work; and who was so
9733,TRUE HEROISM.,"industrious and attentive, that being now at the age of thirteen or"
9734,TRUE HEROISM.,"fourteen, he was able to earn pretty good wages, every farthing of"
9735,TRUE HEROISM.,"which, that he could keep out of his father’s hands, he brought to his"
9736,TRUE HEROISM.,"mother. And when his brute of a father came home drunk, cursing and"
9737,TRUE HEROISM.,"swearing, and in such an ill humour, that his mother and the rest of the"
9738,TRUE HEROISM.,"children durst not come near him for fear of a beating, this good lad"
9739,TRUE HEROISM.,"(Tom was his name) kept near him, to pacify him, and get him quietly to"
9740,TRUE HEROISM.,"bed. His mother, therefore, justly looked upon Tom as the support of the"
9741,TRUE HEROISM.,"family, and loved him dearly."
9742,TRUE HEROISM.,
9743,TRUE HEROISM.,"It chanced that one day Tom, in climbing up a high ladder with a load of"
9744,TRUE HEROISM.,"mortar on his head, missed his hold, and fell down to the bottom on a"
9745,TRUE HEROISM.,"heap of bricks and rubbish. The bystanders ran up to him, and found him"
9746,TRUE HEROISM.,"all bloody, and with his thigh broken and bent quite under him. They"
9747,TRUE HEROISM.,"raised him up, and sprinkled water on his face to recover him from a"
9748,TRUE HEROISM.,"swoon into which he had fallen. As soon as he could speak, looking"
9749,TRUE HEROISM.,"round, with a lamentable tone he cried, “O, what will become of my poor"
9750,TRUE HEROISM.,mother!”
9751,TRUE HEROISM.,
9752,TRUE HEROISM.,"He was carried home, I was present while the surgeon set his thigh. His"
9753,TRUE HEROISM.,"mother was hanging over him half distracted: “Don’t cry, mother!” said"
9754,TRUE HEROISM.,"he, “I shall get well again in time.” Not a word more or a groan escaped"
9755,TRUE HEROISM.,him while the operation lasted.
9756,TRUE HEROISM.,
9757,TRUE HEROISM.,Tom was a ragged boy that could not read or write—yet Tom has always
9758,TRUE HEROISM.,stood on my list of heroes.

9774,PART 1.,"George and Harry, with their tutor, one day in their walk, were driven"
9775,PART 1.,by the rain to take shelter in a blacksmith’s shop; and the shower
9776,PART 1.,"lasting some time, the boys, in order to amuse themselves, began to"
9777,PART 1.,examine the things around them. The great bellows first attracted their
9778,PART 1.,"notice, and they admired the roaring it made, and the expedition with"
9779,PART 1.,which it raised the fire to a heat too intense for them to look at. They
9780,PART 1.,were surprised at the dexterity with which the smith fashioned a bar of
9781,PART 1.,"iron into a horseshoe; first heating it, then hammering it well on the"
9782,PART 1.,"anvil, cutting off a proper length, bending it round, turning up the"
9783,PART 1.,"ends, and lastly, punching the nail-holes. They watched the whole"
9784,PART 1.,"process of fitting it to the horse’s foot, and fastening it on; and it"
9785,PART 1.,had become fair some minutes before they showed a desire to leave the
9786,PART 1.,shop and proceed on their walk.
9787,PART 1.,
9788,PART 1.,"“I should never have thought,” says George, beginning the conversation,"
9789,PART 1.,“that such a hard thing as iron could have been so easily managed.”
9790,PART 1.,
9791,PART 1.,"“Nor I neither,” said Harry."
9792,PART 1.,
9793,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It was managed, you saw, by the help of fire. The fire made it"
9794,PART 1.,"soft and flexible, so that the smith could easily hammer it, and cut it,"
9795,PART 1.,and bend it to the shape he wanted; and then dipping it in the water
9796,PART 1.,made it hard again.
9797,PART 1.,
9798,PART 1.,_Geo._ Are all other metals managed in the same manner?
9799,PART 1.,
9800,PART 1.,"_Tut._ They are all worked by the help of fire in some way or other,"
9801,PART 1.,"either in melting them, or making them soft."
9802,PART 1.,
9803,PART 1.,"_Geo._ There are a good many sorts of metals, are there not?"
9804,PART 1.,
9805,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes, several; and if you have a mind I will tell you about them,"
9806,PART 1.,and their uses.
9807,PART 1.,
9808,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Pray do, sir."
9809,PART 1.,
9810,PART 1.,_Har._ Yes; I should like to hear it of all things.
9811,PART 1.,
9812,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Well, then. First, let us consider what a metal is. Do you think"
9813,PART 1.,you should know one from a stone?
9814,PART 1.,
9815,PART 1.,"_Geo._ A stone!—Yes, I could not mistake a piece of lead or iron for a"
9816,PART 1.,stone.
9817,PART 1.,
9818,PART 1.,_Tut._ How would you distinguish it?
9819,PART 1.,
9820,PART 1.,_Geo._ A metal is bright and shining.
9821,PART 1.,
9822,PART 1.,_Tut._ True—brilliance is one of their qualities. But glass and crystal
9823,PART 1.,"are very bright, too."
9824,PART 1.,
9825,PART 1.,"_Har._ But one may see through glass, and not through a piece of metal."
9826,PART 1.,
9827,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Right. Metals are brilliant, but opaque, or not transparent. The"
9828,PART 1.,thinnest plate of metal that can be made will keep out the light as
9829,PART 1.,effectually as a stone-wall.
9830,PART 1.,
9831,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Metals are very heavy, too."
9832,PART 1.,
9833,PART 1.,_Tut._ True. They are the heaviest bodies in nature; for the lightest
9834,PART 1.,"metal is nearly twice as heavy as the heaviest stone. Well, what else?"
9835,PART 1.,
9836,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Why, they will bear beating with a hammer, which a stone would"
9837,PART 1.,"not, without flying in pieces."
9838,PART 1.,
9839,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes: that property of extending or spreading under the hammer, is"
9840,PART 1.,"called _malleability_; and another, like it, is that of bearing to be"
9841,PART 1.,"drawn out into a wire, which is called _ductility_. Metals have both"
9842,PART 1.,"these, and much of their use depends upon them."
9843,PART 1.,
9844,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Metals will melt, too."
9845,PART 1.,
9846,PART 1.,_Har._ What! will iron melt?
9847,PART 1.,
9848,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes; all metals will melt, though some require greater heat than"
9849,PART 1.,others. The property of melting is called _fusibility_. Do you know
9850,PART 1.,anything more about them?
9851,PART 1.,
9852,PART 1.,"_Geo._ No; except that they come out of the ground, I believe."
9853,PART 1.,
9854,PART 1.,"_Tut._ That is properly added, for it is this circumstance which makes"
9855,PART 1.,"them rank among _fossils_, or minerals. To sum up their character, then,"
9856,PART 1.,"a metal is a brilliant, opaque, heavy, malleable, ductile, and fusible"
9857,PART 1.,mineral.
9858,PART 1.,
9859,PART 1.,_Geo._ I think I can hardly remember all that.
9860,PART 1.,
9861,PART 1.,"_Tut._ The _names_ may slip your memory, but you cannot see metals at"
9862,PART 1.,"all used, without being sensible of the _things_."
9863,PART 1.,
9864,PART 1.,_Geo._ But what are _ores_? I remember seeing a heap of iron ore which
9865,PART 1.,"men were breaking with hammers, and it looked only like stones."
9866,PART 1.,
9867,PART 1.,_Tut._ The _ore_ of a metal is the state in which it is generally met
9868,PART 1.,"with in the earth, when it is so mixed with stony and other matters, as"
9869,PART 1.,not to show its proper qualities as a metal.
9870,PART 1.,
9871,PART 1.,"_Har._ How do people know it, then?"
9872,PART 1.,
9873,PART 1.,_Tut._ By experience. It was probably accident that in the early ages
9874,PART 1.,discovered that certain fossils by the force of fire might be made to
9875,PART 1.,yield a metal. The experiment was repeated on other fossils; so that in
9876,PART 1.,"length of time all the different metals were found out, and all the"
9877,PART 1.,different forms in which they lie concealed in the ground. The knowledge
9878,PART 1.,"of this is called _mineralogy_, and a very important science it is."
9879,PART 1.,
9880,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Yes, I suppose so: for metals are very valuable things. Our next"
9881,PART 1.,"neighbour, Mr. Stirling, I have heard, gets a great deal of money every"
9882,PART 1.,"year, from his mines in Wales."
9883,PART 1.,
9884,PART 1.,_Tut._ He does. The mineral riches of some countries are much superior
9885,PART 1.,"to that of their products above ground, and the revenues of many kings"
9886,PART 1.,are in great part derived from their mines.
9887,PART 1.,
9888,PART 1.,_Har._ I suppose they must be gold and silver mines?
9889,PART 1.,
9890,PART 1.,"_Tat._ Those, to be sure, are the most valuable, if the metals are found"
9891,PART 1.,in tolerable abundance. But do you know why they are so?
9892,PART 1.,
9893,PART 1.,_Har._ Because money is made of gold and silver.
9894,PART 1.,
9895,PART 1.,"_Tut._ That is a principal reason, no doubt. But these metals have"
9896,PART 1.,"intrinsic properties that make them highly valuable, else probably they"
9897,PART 1.,would not have been chosen in so many countries to make money of. In the
9898,PART 1.,"first place, gold and silver are both _perfect metals_, that is,"
9899,PART 1.,"indestructible in the fire. Other metals, if kept a considerable time in"
9900,PART 1.,"the fire, change by degrees into an earthy, scaly matter, called an"
9901,PART 1.,"oxide. You have melted lead, I dare say?"
9902,PART 1.,
9903,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Yes, often."
9904,PART 1.,
9905,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Have you not, then, perceived a drossy film collect upon its"
9906,PART 1.,"surface, after it had kept melting a while?"
9907,PART 1.,
9908,PART 1.,_Geo._ Yes.
9909,PART 1.,
9910,PART 1.,_Tut._ That is an oxide; and in time the whole lead would change to such
9911,PART 1.,"a substance. You may see, too, when you have heated the poker red-hot,"
9912,PART 1.,"some scales separate from it, which are brittle."
9913,PART 1.,
9914,PART 1.,"_Har._ Yes, the kitchen poker is almost burnt away by putting into the"
9915,PART 1.,fire.
9916,PART 1.,
9917,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Well—all metals undergo these changes, except gold and silver;"
9918,PART 1.,"but these, if kept ever so long in the hottest fire, sustain no loss or"
9919,PART 1.,change. They are therefore called _perfect metals_. Gold has several
9920,PART 1.,other remarkable properties. It is the heaviest of all metals.
9921,PART 1.,
9922,PART 1.,"_Har._ What, is it heavier than lead?"
9923,PART 1.,
9924,PART 1.,_Tut._ Yes—about half as heavy again. It is between nineteen and twenty
9925,PART 1.,times as heavy as an equal bulk of water. This great weight is a ready
9926,PART 1.,means of discovering counterfeit gold coin from genuine; for as gold
9927,PART 1.,"must be adulterated with something much lighter than itself, a false"
9928,PART 1.,"coin, if of the same weight with the true, will be sensibly bigger."
9929,PART 1.,"Gold, too, is the most ductile of all metals. You have seen gold-leaf?"
9930,PART 1.,
9931,PART 1.,_Geo._ Yes; I bought a book of it once.
9932,PART 1.,
9933,PART 1.,_Tut._ Gold-leaf is made by beating a plate of gold placed between
9934,PART 1.,"pieces of skin, with heavy hammers, till it is spread out to the utmost"
9935,PART 1.,"degree of thinness. And so great is its capacity for being extended,"
9936,PART 1.,"that a single grain of the metal, which would be scarce bigger than a"
9937,PART 1.,"large pin’s head, is beaten out to a surface of fifty square inches."
9938,PART 1.,
9939,PART 1.,"_Geo._ That is wonderful, indeed! But I know gold-leaf must be very"
9940,PART 1.,"thin, for it will almost float upon the air."
9941,PART 1.,
9942,PART 1.,"_Tut._ By drawing gold out to a wire, it may be still farther extended."
9943,PART 1.,"Gold wire, as it is called, is made with silver overlaid with a small"
9944,PART 1.,"proportion of gold, and they are drawn out together. In the wire"
9945,PART 1.,"commonly used for laces, and embroidery, and the like, a grain of gold"
9946,PART 1.,is made completely to cover a length of three hundred and fifty-two
9947,PART 1.,"feet; and when it is stretched still farther by flatting, it will reach"
9948,PART 1.,four hundred and one feet.
9949,PART 1.,
9950,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Prodigious! What a vast way a guinea might be drawn out, then!"
9951,PART 1.,
9952,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes, the gold of a guinea at that rate would reach above nine"
9953,PART 1.,miles and a half. This property in gold of being capable of extension to
9954,PART 1.,"so extraordinary a degree, is owing to its great tenacity or cohesion of"
9955,PART 1.,"particles, which is such, that you can scarcely break a piece of gold"
9956,PART 1.,wire by twisting it.
9957,PART 1.,
9958,PART 1.,_Har._ Then it would make very good wire for hanging bells.
9959,PART 1.,
9960,PART 1.,_Tut._ It would; but such bell-hanging would come rather too dear.
9961,PART 1.,"Another valuable quality of gold, is its fine colour. You know scarce"
9962,PART 1.,anything makes a more splendid appearance than gilding. And a peculiar
9963,PART 1.,"advantage of it is, that gold is not liable to rust or tarnish, as other"
9964,PART 1.,"metals are. It will keep its colour fresh for a great many years, in a"
9965,PART 1.,pure and clear air.
9966,PART 1.,
9967,PART 1.,_Har._ I remember the vane of the church-steeple was new-gilt two years
9968,PART 1.,"ago, and it looks as well as at first."
9969,PART 1.,
9970,PART 1.,_Tut._ This property of not rusting would render gold very useful for a
9971,PART 1.,"variety of purposes, if it were more common. It would make excellent"
9972,PART 1.,"cooking utensils, water-pipes, mathematical instruments, clockwork, and"
9973,PART 1.,the like.
9974,PART 1.,
9975,PART 1.,_Geo._ But is not gold soft? I have seen pieces of gold bent double.
9976,PART 1.,
9977,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes; it is next in softness to lead, and, therefore, when it is"
9978,PART 1.,"made into coin, or used for any common purposes, it is mixed with a"
9979,PART 1.,"small proportion of some other metal, in order to harden it. This is"
9980,PART 1.,"called its _alloy_. Our gold coin has one twelfth of alloy, which is"
9981,PART 1.,copper.
9982,PART 1.,
9983,PART 1.,_Geo._ How beautiful new gold coin is!
9984,PART 1.,
9985,PART 1.,_Tut._ Yes—scarce any metal takes a stamp or impression better; and it
9986,PART 1.,is capable of a very fine polish.
9987,PART 1.,
9988,PART 1.,_Geo._ What countries yield the most gold?
9989,PART 1.,
9990,PART 1.,"_Tut._ South America, the East Indies, and the coast of Africa. Europe"
9991,PART 1.,affords but little; yet a moderate quantity is got every year from
9992,PART 1.,Hungary.
9993,PART 1.,
9994,PART 1.,_Geo._ I have heard of rivers rolling sands of gold. Is there any truth
9995,PART 1.,in that?
9996,PART 1.,
9997,PART 1.,"_Tut._ The poets, as usual, have exaggerated the matter: however, there"
9998,PART 1.,"are various streams in different parts of the world, the sands of which"
9999,PART 1.,"contain particles of gold, and some of them in such quantity as to be"
10000,PART 1.,worth the search.
10001,PART 1.,
10002,PART 1.,_Har._ How does the gold come there?
10003,PART 1.,
10004,PART 1.,_Tut._ It is washed down along with the soil from mountains by the
10005,PART 1.,torrents which are the sources of rivers. Some persons say that all
10006,PART 1.,sands contain gold; but I would not advise you to take the pains to
10007,PART 1.,"search for it in our common sand: for, in more senses than one, _gold"
10008,PART 1.,may be bought too dear_.
10009,PART 1.,
10010,PART 1.,_Har._ But what a fine thing it would be to find a gold mine on one’s
10011,PART 1.,estate!
10012,PART 1.,
10013,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Perhaps not so fine as you may imagine, for many a one does not"
10014,PART 1.,pay the cost of working. A coal-pit would probably be a better thing.
10015,PART 1.,Who do you think are the greatest gold-finders in Europe?
10016,PART 1.,
10017,PART 1.,_Har._ I don’t know.
10018,PART 1.,
10019,PART 1.,"_Tut._ The gipsies in Hungary. A number of half-starved, half-naked"
10020,PART 1.,wretches of that community employ themselves in washing and picking the
10021,PART 1.,"sands of some mountain-streams in that country which contain gold, from"
10022,PART 1.,which they obtain just profit enough to keep body and soul together:
10023,PART 1.,"whereas, did they employ themselves in agriculture or manufactures, they"
10024,PART 1.,"might have got a comfortable subsistence. Gold, almost all the world"
10025,PART 1.,"over, is first got by slaves, and it makes slaves of those who possess"
10026,PART 1.,much of it.
10027,PART 1.,
10028,PART 1.,"_Geo._ For my part, I will be content with a silver mine."
10029,PART 1.,
10030,PART 1.,"_Har._ But we have none of those in England, have we?"
10031,PART 1.,
10032,PART 1.,"_Tut._ We have no silver mines, properly so called, but silver is"
10033,PART 1.,"procured in some of our lead mines. There are, however, valuable silver"
10034,PART 1.,"mines in various parts of Europe; but the richest of all are in Peru, in"
10035,PART 1.,South America.
10036,PART 1.,
10037,PART 1.,_Geo._ Are not the famous mines of Potosi there?
10038,PART 1.,
10039,PART 1.,_Tut._ They are. Shall I now tell you some of the properties of silver?
10040,PART 1.,
10041,PART 1.,_Geo._ By all means.
10042,PART 1.,
10043,PART 1.,_Tut._ It is another _perfect_ metal. It is also as little liable to
10044,PART 1.,"rust as gold, though indeed it readily gets tarnished."
10045,PART 1.,
10046,PART 1.,_Har._ Yes; I know our footman is often obliged to clean our plate
10047,PART 1.,before it is used.
10048,PART 1.,
10049,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Plate, however, is not made of pure silver, any more than silver"
10050,PART 1.,"coin, and silver utensils of all kinds. Copper is mixed with it, as with"
10051,PART 1.,"gold, to harden it; and that makes it more liable to tarnish."
10052,PART 1.,
10053,PART 1.,"_Geo._ Bright silver, I think, is almost as beautiful as gold."
10054,PART 1.,
10055,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It is the most beautiful of the white metals, and is capable of a"
10056,PART 1.,"very fine polish; and this, together with its rarity, makes it used for"
10057,PART 1.,a great variety of ornamental purposes. Then it is nearly as ductile and
10058,PART 1.,malleable as gold.
10059,PART 1.,
10060,PART 1.,"_Geo._ I have had silver-leaf, and it seemed as thin as gold-leaf."
10061,PART 1.,
10062,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It is nearly so. That is used for silvering, as gold-leaf is for"
10063,PART 1.,"gilding. It is common, too, to cover metals with a thin coating of"
10064,PART 1.,silver which is called plating.
10065,PART 1.,
10066,PART 1.,_Har._ The child’s saucepan is silvered over on the inside. What is that
10067,PART 1.,for?
10068,PART 1.,
10069,PART 1.,_Tut._ To prevent the victuals from getting any taint from the metal of
10070,PART 1.,the saucepan; for silver is not capable of being corroded or dissolved
10071,PART 1.,"by any of the liquids used for food, as iron and copper are."
10072,PART 1.,
10073,PART 1.,_Har._ And that is the reason I suppose that fruit-knives are made of
10074,PART 1.,silver.
10075,PART 1.,
10076,PART 1.,_Tut._ It is; but the softness of the metal makes them bear a very poor
10077,PART 1.,edge.
10078,PART 1.,
10079,PART 1.,_Geo._ Does silver melt easily?
10080,PART 1.,
10081,PART 1.,_Tut._ Silver and gold both melt more difficultly than lead; not till
10082,PART 1.,"they are above a common red heat. As to the weight of silver, it is"
10083,PART 1.,"nearly one half less than that of gold, being only eleven times as heavy"
10084,PART 1.,as water.
10085,PART 1.,
10086,PART 1.,_Har._ Is quicksilver a kind of silver?
10087,PART 1.,
10088,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It takes its name from silver, being very like it in colour; but"
10089,PART 1.,"in reality it is a very different thing, and one of the most singular of"
10090,PART 1.,the metal kind.
10091,PART 1.,
10092,PART 1.,"_Geo._ It is not _malleable_, I am sure."
10093,PART 1.,
10094,PART 1.,"_Tut._ No; not when it is quick or fluid, as it always is in our"
10095,PART 1.,"climate. But a very great degree of cold makes it solid, and then it is"
10096,PART 1.,malleable like other metals.
10097,PART 1.,
10098,PART 1.,"_Geo._ I have heard of _killing_ quicksilver; pray, what does that mean?"
10099,PART 1.,
10100,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It means destroying its property of running about, by mixing it"
10101,PART 1.,"with something else. Thus if quicksilver be well rubbed with fat, or"
10102,PART 1.,"oil, or gum, it unites with them, losing all its metallic appearance or"
10103,PART 1.,"fluidity. It also unites readily with gold and silver, and several other"
10104,PART 1.,"metals, into a kind of shining paste, which is called an _amalgam_. This"
10105,PART 1.,is one of the ways of gilding or silvering a thing. Your buttons are
10106,PART 1.,gilt by means of an amalgam.
10107,PART 1.,
10108,PART 1.,_Geo._ How is that done?
10109,PART 1.,
10110,PART 1.,"_Tut._ The shells of the buttons, which are made of copper, are shaken"
10111,PART 1.,"in a hat with a lump of amalgam of gold and quicksilver, till they are"
10112,PART 1.,"all covered over with it. They are then put into a sort of frying-pan,"
10113,PART 1.,"and held over the fire. The quicksilver, being very volatile in its"
10114,PART 1.,"nature, flies off in the form of a smoke or vapour when it is heated,"
10115,PART 1.,leaving the gold behind it spread over the surface of the button. Thus
10116,PART 1.,many dozens are gilt at once with the greatest ease.
10117,PART 1.,
10118,PART 1.,_Geo._ What a clever way! I should like vastly to see it done.
10119,PART 1.,
10120,PART 1.,"_Tut._ You may see it any day at Birmingham, if you happen to be there;"
10121,PART 1.,as well as a great many other curious operations on metals.
10122,PART 1.,
10123,PART 1.,_Geo._ What a weight quicksilver is! I remember taking up a bottleful of
10124,PART 1.,"it, and I had liked to have dropped it again, it was so much heavier"
10125,PART 1.,than I expected.
10126,PART 1.,
10127,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes, it is one of the heaviest of the metals—about fifteen times"
10128,PART 1.,as heavy as water.
10129,PART 1.,
10130,PART 1.,_Geo._ Is not _mercury_ a name for quicksilver? I have heard them talk
10131,PART 1.,of the mercury rising and falling in the weather-glass.
10132,PART 1.,
10133,PART 1.,"_Tut._ It is. You, perhaps, may have heard too of _mercurial medicines_,"
10134,PART 1.,which are those made of quicksilver prepared in one manner or another.
10135,PART 1.,
10136,PART 1.,_Geo._ What are they good for?
10137,PART 1.,
10138,PART 1.,_Tut._ For a great variety of complaints. Your brother took some lately
10139,PART 1.,"for the worms; and they are often given for breakings-out on the skin,"
10140,PART 1.,"and for sores and swellings. But they have one remarkable effect, when"
10141,PART 1.,"taken in a considerable quantity, which is to loosen the teeth, and"
10142,PART 1.,cause a great spitting. This is called salivation.
10143,PART 1.,
10144,PART 1.,_Har._ I used to think quicksilver was poison.
10145,PART 1.,
10146,PART 1.,_Tut._ When it is in its common state of running quicksilver it
10147,PART 1.,"generally does neither good nor harm; but it may be prepared, so as to"
10148,PART 1.,"be a very violent medicine, or even a poison."
10149,PART 1.,
10150,PART 1.,_Geo._ Is it useful for anything else?
10151,PART 1.,
10152,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Yes—For a variety of purposes in the arts, which I cannot now"
10153,PART 1.,very well explain to you. But you will perhaps be surprised to hear that
10154,PART 1.,one of the finest red paints is made from quicksilver.
10155,PART 1.,
10156,PART 1.,_Geo._ A red paint!—which is that?
10157,PART 1.,
10158,PART 1.,"_Tut._ Vermilion, or cinnabar, which is a particular mixture of sulphur"
10159,PART 1.,with quicksilver.
10160,PART 1.,
10161,PART 1.,_Har._ Is quicksilver found in this country?
10162,PART 1.,
10163,PART 1.,"_Tut._ No. The greatest quantity comes from Spain, Istria, and South"
10164,PART 1.,"America. It is a considerable object of commerce, and bears a high"
10165,PART 1.,"value, though much inferior to silver. Well, so much for metals at"
10166,PART 1.,present. We will talk of the rest on some future opportunity.

10172,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10173,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10174,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"“How I wish I could fly!” cried Robert, as he was gazing after his"
10175,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,pigeons that were exercising themselves in a morning’s flight. “How fine
10176,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"it must be to soar to such a height, and to dash through the air with so"
10177,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,swift a motion!”
10178,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10179,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"“I doubt not,” said his father, “that the pigeons have great pleasure in"
10180,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"it; but we have our pleasures, too; and it is idle to indulge longings"
10181,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,for things quite out of our power.”
10182,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10183,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Robert._ But do you think it impossible for men to learn to fly?
10184,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10185,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Father._ I do—for I see they are not furnished by Nature with organs
10186,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,requisite for the purpose.
10187,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10188,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ Might not artificial wings be contrived, such as Dædalus is said"
10189,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,to have used?
10190,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10191,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ Possibly they might; but the difficulty would be to put them in
10192,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,motion.
10193,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10194,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ Why could not a man move them, if they were fastened to his"
10195,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"shoulders, as well as a bird?"
10196,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10197,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ Because he has got arms to move which the bird has not. The same
10198,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"organs which in quadrupeds are employed to move the fore-legs, and in"
10199,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"man the arms, are used by birds in the motion of the wings. Nay, muscles"
10200,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"or bundles of flesh, that move the wings, are proportionally much larger"
10201,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,and stronger than those bestowed upon our arms; so that it is
10202,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"impossible, formed as we are, that we should use wings, were they made"
10203,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,and fastened on with ever so much art.
10204,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10205,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ But angels, and cupids, and such things are painted with wings;"
10206,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,and I think they look very natural.
10207,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10208,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ To you they may appear so; but an anatomist sees them at once to
10209,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"be monsters, which could not really exist."
10210,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10211,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ God might have created winged men, however, if he had pleased."
10212,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10213,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ No doubt; but they could not have had the same shape that men have
10214,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"now. They would have been different creatures, such as it was not in his"
10215,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,plan to make. But you that long to fly—consider if you have made use of
10216,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,all the faculties already given you! You want to subdue the element of
10217,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,air—what can you do with that of water? Can you swim?
10218,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10219,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ No, not yet."
10220,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10221,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Fa._ Your companion, Johnson, I think, can swim very well?"
10222,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10223,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Rob._ Yes.
10224,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10225,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Fa._ Reflect, then, on the difference betwixt him and you. A boat"
10226,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,oversets with you both in a deep stream. You plump at once to the
10227,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"bottom, and infallibly lose your life. He rises like a cork, darts away"
10228,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"with the greatest ease, and reaches the side in perfect safety. Both of"
10229,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"you, pursued by a bull, come to the side of a river. He jumps in and"
10230,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"crosses it. You are drowned if you attempt it, and tossed by the bull if"
10231,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,you do not. What an advantage he has over you! Yet you are furnished
10232,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,with exactly the same bodily powers that he is. How is this?
10233,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10234,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Bob._ Because he has been taught, and I have not."
10235,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10236,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Fa._ True, but it is an easy thing to learn, and requires no other"
10237,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,instruction than boys can give one another when they bathe together: so
10238,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,that I wonder anybody should neglect to acquire an art at once agreeable
10239,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"and useful. The Romans used to say, by way of proverb, of a blockhead,"
10240,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,“He can neither read nor swim.” You may remember how Cesar was saved at
10241,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"Alexandria by throwing himself into the sea, and swimming with one hand,"
10242,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,while he held up his commentaries with the other.
10243,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10244,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ I should like very well to swim, and I have often tried, but I"
10245,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"always pop under water, and that daunts me."
10246,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10247,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ And it is that fear which prevents you from succeeding.
10248,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10249,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Rob._ But is it as natural for man to swim as for other creatures? I
10250,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,have heard that the young of all other animals swim the first time they
10251,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,are thrown into the water.
10252,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10253,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ They do—they are without fear. In our climate the water is
10254,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"generally cold, and is early made an object of terror. But in the hot"
10255,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"countries, where bathing is one of the greatest pleasures, young"
10256,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"children swim so early and well, that I should suppose they take to it"
10257,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,almost naturally.
10258,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10259,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Rob._ I am resolved to learn, and will ask Johnson to take me with him"
10260,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,to the river.
10261,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10262,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ Do; but let him find you a safe place to begin at. I don’t want
10263,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"you, however, to proceed so cautiously as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack did."
10264,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10265,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Rob._ How was that?
10266,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10267,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"_Fa._ He spread himself out on a large table, and placing before him a"
10268,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"basin of water with a frog in it, he struck with his arms and legs as he"
10269,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,observed the animal do.
10270,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10271,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Rob._ And did that teach him?
10272,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10273,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ Yes—to swim on dry land; but he never ventured himself in the
10274,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,water.
10275,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10276,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Rob._ Shall I get corks or bladders?
10277,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,
10278,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,_Fa._ No; learn to depend on your own powers. It is a good lesson in
10279,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"other things, as well as in swimming. Learning to swim with corks, is"
10280,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,like learning to construe Latin with a translation on the other side. It
10281,FLYING AND SWIMMING.,"saves some pains at first, but the business is not done half so"

10290,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"A young girl, having fatigued herself one hot day with running about the"
10291,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"garden, sat herself down in a pleasant arbour, where she presently fell"
10292,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"asleep. During her slumbers, two female figures presented themselves"
10293,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,before her. One was loosely habited in a thin robe of pink with light
10294,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,green trimmings. Her sash of silver gauze flowed to the ground. Her fair
10295,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,hair fell in ringlets down her neck; and her head-dress consisted of
10296,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,artificial flowers interwoven with feathers. She held in one hand a
10297,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"ball-ticket, and in the other a fancy-dress all covered with spangles"
10298,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"and knots of gay riband. She advanced smiling to the girl, and with a"
10299,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,familiar air thus addressed her:—
10300,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10301,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"“My dearest Melissa, I am a kind genius, who have watched you from your"
10302,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"birth, and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand, till at length"
10303,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,they have rendered you a companion worthy of me. See what I have brought
10304,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,you. This dress and this ticket will give you free access to all the
10305,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,ravishing delights of my palace. With me you will pass your days in a
10306,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"perpetual round of ever-varying amusements. Like the gay butterfly, you"
10307,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"will have no other business than to flutter from flower to flower, and"

10309,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"no dull tasks are to be found within my happy domains. All is pleasure,"
10310,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"life, and good humour. Come, then, my dear! Let me put this dress on"
10311,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"you, which will make you quite enchanting; and away, away, with me!”"
10312,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10313,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,Melissa felt a strong inclination to comply with the call of this
10314,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,inviting nymph; but first she thought it would be prudent at least to
10315,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,ask her name.
10316,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10317,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"“My name,” said she, “is DISSIPATION.”"
10318,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10319,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,The other female then advanced. She was clothed in a close habit of
10320,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"brown stuff, simply relieved with white. She wore her smooth hair under"
10321,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,a plain cap. Her whole person was perfectly neat and clean. Her look was
10322,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"serious, but satisfied; and her air was staid and composed. She held in"
10323,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,one hand a distaff; on the opposite arm hung a workbasket; and the
10324,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"girdle round her waist was garnished with scissors, knitting needles,"
10325,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"reels, and other implements of female labour. A bunch of keys hung at"
10326,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,her side. She thus accosted the sleeping girl:—
10327,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10328,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"“Melissa, I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion of"
10329,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,your mother; and I now offer my protection to you. I have no allurements
10330,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"to tempt you with, like those of my gay rival. Instead of spending all"
10331,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"your time in amusements, if you enter yourself of my train, you must"
10332,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"rise early, and pass the long day in a variety of employments, some of"
10333,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"them difficult, some laborious, and all requiring some exertion of body"
10334,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"or mind. You must dress plainly, live mostly at home, and aim at being"
10335,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"useful rather than shining. But in return I will ensure you content,"
10336,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"even spirits, self-approbation, and the esteem of all who thoroughly"
10337,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,know you. If these offers appear to your young mind less inviting than
10338,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"those of my rival, be assured, however, that they are more real. She has"
10339,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,promised much more than she can ever make good. Perpetual pleasures are
10340,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"no more in the power of Dissipation, than of Vice or Folly to bestow."
10341,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"Her delights quickly pall, and are inevitably succeeded by languor and"
10342,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"disgust. She appears to you under disguise, and what you see is not her"
10343,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"real face. For myself, I shall never seem to you less amiable than I now"
10344,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"do, but, on the contrary, you will like me better and better. If I look"
10345,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"grave to you now, you will hear me sing at my work; and when work is"
10346,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"over, I can dance too. But I have said enough. It is time for you to"
10347,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"choose whom you will follow, and upon that choice all your happiness"
10348,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"depends. If you would know my name, it is HOUSEWIFERY.”"
10349,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,
10350,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,Melissa heard her with more attention than delight; and though overawed
10351,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"by her manner, she could not help turning again to take another look at"
10352,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,the first speaker. She beheld her still offering her presents with so
10353,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"bewitching an air that she felt it scarcely possible to resist: when, by"
10354,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"a lucky accident, the mask with which Dissipation’s face was so artfully"
10355,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"covered, fell off. As soon as Melissa beheld, instead of the smiling"
10356,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"features of youth and cheerfulness, a countenance wan and ghastly with"
10357,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,"sickness, and soured by fretfulness, she turned away with horror, and"
10358,THE FEMALE CHOICE.—A TALE.,gave her hand unreluctantly to her sober and sincere companion.

10374,PART II.,_Tutor_—_George_—_Harry_.
10375,PART II.,
10376,PART II.,_Tutor._ Well—have you forgotten what I told you about metals the other
10377,PART II.,day?
10378,PART II.,
10379,PART II.,_George._ O no!
10380,PART II.,
10381,PART II.,_Harry._ I am sure I have not.
10382,PART II.,
10383,PART II.,_Tut._ What metals were they that we talked about?
10384,PART II.,
10385,PART II.,"_Geo._ Gold, silver, and quicksilver."
10386,PART II.,
10387,PART II.,"_Tut._ Suppose, then, we go on to the rest?"
10388,PART II.,
10389,PART II.,"_Geo._ Pray, do."
10390,PART II.,
10391,PART II.,"_Har._ Yes, by all means."
10392,PART II.,
10393,PART II.,"_Tut._ Very well. You know _copper_, I don’t doubt?"
10394,PART II.,
10395,PART II.,_Geo._ O yes!
10396,PART II.,
10397,PART II.,_Tut._ What colour do you call it?
10398,PART II.,
10399,PART II.,_Geo._ I think it is a sort of reddish brown.
10400,PART II.,
10401,PART II.,"_Tut._ True. Sometimes, however, it is of a bright red, like"
10402,PART II.,"sealing-wax. It is not a very heavy metal, being not quite nine times"
10403,PART II.,"the weight of water. It is very ductile, bearing to be rolled or"
10404,PART II.,"hammered out to a very thin plate, and also to be drawn out to a fine"
10405,PART II.,wire.
10406,PART II.,
10407,PART II.,_Har._ I remember seeing a penny that had been rolled out to a long
10408,PART II.,riband.
10409,PART II.,
10410,PART II.,"_Geo._ Yes, and I have seen half a dozen men at a time with great"
10411,PART II.,hammers beating out a piece of copper at the brazier’s.
10412,PART II.,
10413,PART II.,_Tut._ Copper requires a very considerable heat to melt it: and by long
10414,PART II.,"exposure to the fire, it may be burnt or calcined; for, like all we are"
10415,PART II.,"now to speak of, it is an _imperfect_ metal."
10416,PART II.,
10417,PART II.,"_Har._ And it rusts very easily, does it not?"
10418,PART II.,
10419,PART II.,"_Tut._ It does; for all acids dissolve or corrode it, so do salts of"
10420,PART II.,every kind: whence even air and common water in a short time act upon
10421,PART II.,"it, for they are never free from somewhat of a saline nature."
10422,PART II.,
10423,PART II.,_Geo._ Is not verdigris the rust of copper?
10424,PART II.,
10425,PART II.,_Tut._ It is; a rust produced by the acid of grapes. But every rust of
10426,PART II.,"copper is of a blue or green colour, as well as verdigris."
10427,PART II.,
10428,PART II.,"_Har._ And are they all poison, too?"
10429,PART II.,
10430,PART II.,"_Tut._ They are all so in some degree, producing violent sickness and"
10431,PART II.,"pain in the bowels. They are all, too, extremely nauseous to the taste,"
10432,PART II.,"and the metal itself when heated, tastes and smells very disagreeably."
10433,PART II.,
10434,PART II.,"_Har._ Why is it used, then, so much in cooking, brewing, and the like?"
10435,PART II.,
10436,PART II.,"_Tut._ Because it is a very convenient metal for making vessels,"
10437,PART II.,"especially large ones, as it is easily worked, and is sufficiently"
10438,PART II.,"strong, though hammered thin, and bears the fire well. And if vessels of"
10439,PART II.,"it are kept quite clean, and the liquor not suffered to stand long in"
10440,PART II.,them when cold there is no danger in their use. But copper vessels for
10441,PART II.,cooking are generally lined on the inside with tin.
10442,PART II.,
10443,PART II.,_Geo._ What else is copper used for?
10444,PART II.,
10445,PART II.,_Tut._ A variety of things. Sheets of copper are sometimes used to cover
10446,PART II.,"buildings; and of late a great quantity is consumed in sheathing ships,"
10447,PART II.,"that is, in covering all the part under water; the purpose of which is,"
10448,PART II.,"to protect the timber from the worms, and also to make the ship sail"
10449,PART II.,"faster, by means of the smoothness and therefore less obstruction which"
10450,PART II.,"the copper offers to the water, as the ship is forced through it by the"
10451,PART II.,action of the wind on the sails.
10452,PART II.,
10453,PART II.,"_Har._ Money is made of copper, too."
10454,PART II.,
10455,PART II.,"_Tut._ It is; for it takes an impression in coining very well, and its"
10456,PART II.,"value is a proper proportion below silver, for a price for the cheapest"
10457,PART II.,commodities. In some poor countries they have little other than copper
10458,PART II.,"coin. Another great use of copper is as an ingredient in mixed metals,"
10459,PART II.,"such as bell-metal, cannon-metal, and particularly brass."
10460,PART II.,
10461,PART II.,_Har._ But brass is yellow.
10462,PART II.,
10463,PART II.,_Tut._ True; it is converted to that colour by means of another metallic
10464,PART II.,"substance, named _zinc_ or _spelter_, the natural colour of which is"
10465,PART II.,white. A kind of brown stone called _calamine_ is an ore of zinc. By
10466,PART II.,filling a pot with layers of powdered calamine and charcoal placed
10467,PART II.,"alternately with copper, and applying a pretty strong heat, the zinc is"
10468,PART II.,"driven in vapour out of the calamine, and penetrates the copper,"
10469,PART II.,changing it into brass.
10470,PART II.,
10471,PART II.,_Geo._ What is the use of turning copper into brass?
10472,PART II.,
10473,PART II.,"_Tut._ It gains a fine gold-like colour, and becomes harder, more easy"
10474,PART II.,"to melt, and less liable to rust. Hence it is preferred for a variety of"
10475,PART II.,"utensils, ornamental and useful. Brass does not bear hammering well, but"
10476,PART II.,"is generally cast into the shape wanted, and then turned in a lathe and"
10477,PART II.,polished. Well—these are the principal things I have to say about
10478,PART II.,copper.
10479,PART II.,
10480,PART II.,_Har._ But where does it come from?
10481,PART II.,
10482,PART II.,_Tut._ Copper is found in many countries. The Isle of Great Britain
10483,PART II.,"yields abundance, especially in Wales and Cornwall. In Anglesey is a"
10484,PART II.,"whole hill called Paris Mountain, consisting of copper-ore, from which"
10485,PART II.,immense quantities are dug every year. Now for _iron_.
10486,PART II.,
10487,PART II.,_Har._ Ay! that is the most useful of all the metals.
10488,PART II.,
10489,PART II.,"_Tut._ I think it is; and it is likewise the most common, for there are"
10490,PART II.,"few countries in the world possessing hills and rocks, where it is not"
10491,PART II.,"met with, more or less. Iron is the hardest of metals, the most elastic"
10492,PART II.,"or springy, very tenacious or difficult to break, the most difficultly"
10493,PART II.,"fusible, and one of the lightest, being only seven or eight times as"
10494,PART II.,heavy as water.
10495,PART II.,
10496,PART II.,_Geo._ You say it is difficult to break; but I snapped the blade of a
10497,PART II.,penknife the other day by only bending it a little; and my mother is
10498,PART II.,continually breaking her needles.
10499,PART II.,
10500,PART II.,_Tut._ Properly objected; but the qualities of iron differ extremely
10501,PART II.,"according to the method of preparing it. There are forged iron, cast"
10502,PART II.,"iron, and steel, which are very different from each other. Iron, when"
10503,PART II.,"first melted from its ore, has little malleability, and the vessels and"
10504,PART II.,"other implements that are made of it in that state, by casting into"
10505,PART II.,"moulds, are easily broken. It acquires toughness and malleability by"
10506,PART II.,"_forging_, which is done by beating it when red-hot with heavy hammers,"
10507,PART II.,"till it becomes ductile and flexible. Steel, again, is made by heating"
10508,PART II.,"small bars of iron with charcoal, bone, and horn shavings, or other"
10509,PART II.,"inflammable matters, by which it acquires a finer grain and more compact"
10510,PART II.,"texture, and becomes harder, and more elastic. Steel may be rendered"
10511,PART II.,"either very flexible or brittle, by different manners of _tempering_,"
10512,PART II.,which is performed by heating and then quenching it in water.
10513,PART II.,
10514,PART II.,"_Geo._ All cutting instruments are made of steel, are they not?"
10515,PART II.,
10516,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes; and the very fine-edged ones are generally tempered brittle,"
10517,PART II.,"as razors, penknives, and surgeons’ instruments; but sword-blades are"
10518,PART II.,"made flexible, and the best of them will bend double without breaking or"
10519,PART II.,becoming crooked. The steel of which springs are made has the highest
10520,PART II.,possible degree of elasticity given it. A watch-spring is one of the
10521,PART II.,most perfect examples of this kind. Steel for ornaments is made
10522,PART II.,"extremely hard and close-grained, so as to bear an exquisite polish."
10523,PART II.,"Common hammered iron is chiefly used for works of strength, as"
10524,PART II.,"horseshoes, bars, bolts, and the like. It will bend but not straighten"
10525,PART II.,"itself again, as you may see in the kitchen poker. Cast iron is used for"
10526,PART II.,"pots and caldrons, cannons, cannon-balls, grates, pillars, and many"
10527,PART II.,other purposes in which hardness without flexibility is wanted.
10528,PART II.,
10529,PART II.,_Geo._ What a vast variety of uses this metal is put to!
10530,PART II.,
10531,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes; I know not when I should have done, if I were tell you of"
10532,PART II.,all.
10533,PART II.,
10534,PART II.,"_Har._ Then I think it is really more valuable than gold, though it is"
10535,PART II.,so much cheaper.
10536,PART II.,
10537,PART II.,"_Tut._ That was the opinion of the wise Solon, when he observed to the"
10538,PART II.,"rich king Crœsus, who was showing him his treasures, “He who possesses"
10539,PART II.,more iron will soon be master of all this gold.”
10540,PART II.,
10541,PART II.,_Har._ I suppose he meant weapons and armour?
10542,PART II.,
10543,PART II.,_Tut._ He did; but there are many nobler uses for these metals; and few
10544,PART II.,circumstances denote the progress of the arts in a country more than
10545,PART II.,"having attained the full use of iron, without which scarcely any"
10546,PART II.,manufacture or machinery can be brought to perfection. From the
10547,PART II.,"difficulty of melting it out of the ore, many nations have been longer"
10548,PART II.,"in discovering it than some of the other metals. The Greeks, in Homer’s"
10549,PART II.,"time, seem to have employed copper or brass for their weapons much more"
10550,PART II.,"than iron; and the Mexicans and Peruvians, who possessed gold and"
10551,PART II.,"silver, were unacquainted with iron, when the Spaniards invaded them."
10552,PART II.,
10553,PART II.,"_Geo._ Iron is very subject to rust, however."
10554,PART II.,
10555,PART II.,"_Tut._ It is so, and that is one of its worst properties. Every liquor,"
10556,PART II.,and even a moist air corrode it. But the rust of iron is not pernicious:
10557,PART II.,"on the contrary, it is a very useful medicine."
10558,PART II.,
10559,PART II.,_Geo._ I have heard of steel drops and steel filings given for medicine.
10560,PART II.,
10561,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes; iron is given in a variety of forms, and the property of"
10562,PART II.,them all is to strengthen the constitution. Many springs are made
10563,PART II.,medicinal by the iron that they dissolve in the bowels of the earth.
10564,PART II.,"These are called _chalybeate_ waters, and they may be known by their"
10565,PART II.,"inky taste, and the rust-coloured sediment they leave in their course."
10566,PART II.,
10567,PART II.,_Har._ May we drink such water if we meet with it?
10568,PART II.,
10569,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes; it will do you no harm, at least. There is one other"
10570,PART II.,"property of iron, well worth knowing, and that is, that it is the only"
10571,PART II.,thing attracted by the magnet or loadstone.
10572,PART II.,
10573,PART II.,_Geo._ I had a magnet once that would take up needles and keys; but it
10574,PART II.,seemed a bar of iron itself.
10575,PART II.,
10576,PART II.,"_Tut._ True. The real loadstone, which is a particular ore of iron, can"
10577,PART II.,"communicate its virtue to a piece of iron by rubbing it; nay, a bar of"
10578,PART II.,"iron itself, in length of time, by being placed in a particular"
10579,PART II.,"position, will acquire the same property."
10580,PART II.,
10581,PART II.,_Geo._ Is all the iron used in England produced there?
10582,PART II.,
10583,PART II.,_Tut._ By no means. Their extensive manufactures require a great
10584,PART II.,"importation of iron. Much is brought from Norway, Russia, and Sweden;"
10585,PART II.,"and the Swedish is reckoned particularly excellent. Well, now to another"
10586,PART II.,metal. I dare say you can tell me a good deal about _lead_?
10587,PART II.,
10588,PART II.,"_Har._ I know several things about it. It is very heavy and soft, and"
10589,PART II.,easily melted.
10590,PART II.,
10591,PART II.,_Tut._ True; these are some of its distinguishing properties. Its weight
10592,PART II.,is between eleven and twelve times that of water. Its colour is a dull
10593,PART II.,"bluish white; and from this livid hue, as well as its being totally void"
10594,PART II.,"of spring or elasticity, it has acquired a sort of character, of dulness"
10595,PART II.,"and sluggishness. Thus we say of a stupid man, that he has a _leaden_"
10596,PART II.,disposition.
10597,PART II.,
10598,PART II.,"_Geo._ Lead is very malleable, I think?"
10599,PART II.,
10600,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes; it may be beaten out into a pretty thin leaf, but it will"
10601,PART II.,"not bear drawing into fine wire. It is not only very fusible, but very"
10602,PART II.,"readily oxidized by heat, changing into a powder, or a scaly matter,"
10603,PART II.,"which may be made to take all colours by the fire, from yellow to deep"
10604,PART II.,red. You have seen red lead?
10605,PART II.,
10606,PART II.,_Geo._ Yes.
10607,PART II.,
10608,PART II.,_Tut._ That is oxide of lead exposed for a considerable time to a strong
10609,PART II.,flame. Lead may even be changed into glass by a moderate heat; and there
10610,PART II.,is a good deal of it in our finest glass.
10611,PART II.,
10612,PART II.,_Geo._ What is white lead?
10613,PART II.,
10614,PART II.,_Tut._ It is lead corroded by the steam of vinegar. Lead in various
10615,PART II.,"forms is much used by painters. Its oxides dissolve in oil, and are"
10616,PART II.,employed for the purpose of thickening paint and making it dry. All lead
10617,PART II.,"paints, however, are unwholesome as long as they continue to smell, and"
10618,PART II.,"the fumes of lead, when melted, are likewise pernicious. This is the"
10619,PART II.,"cause why painters and plumbers are so subject to various diseases,"
10620,PART II.,particularly violent colics and palsies. The white-lead manufacture is
10621,PART II.,"so hurtful to the health, that the workmen, in a very short time, are"
10622,PART II.,"apt to lose the use of their limbs, and be otherwise severely"
10623,PART II.,indisposed.
10624,PART II.,
10625,PART II.,"_Geo._ I wonder, then, that anybody will work in it."
10626,PART II.,
10627,PART II.,_Tut._ Ignorance and high wages are sufficient to induce them. But it is
10628,PART II.,to be lamented that in a great many manufactures the health and lives of
10629,PART II.,individuals are sacrificed to the convenience and profit of the
10630,PART II.,"community. Lead, too, when dissolved, as it may be in all sour liquors,"
10631,PART II.,"is a slow poison, and the more dangerous, as it gives no disagreeable"
10632,PART II.,"taste. A salt of lead made with vinegar, is so sweet, as to be called"
10633,PART II.,the sugar of lead. It has been too common to put this or some other
10634,PART II.,"preparation of lead into sour wines, in order to cure them; and much"
10635,PART II.,mischief has been done by this practice.
10636,PART II.,
10637,PART II.,"_Geo._ If lead is poisonous, is it not wrong to make water-pipes and"
10638,PART II.,cisterns of it?
10639,PART II.,
10640,PART II.,_Tut._ This has been objected to; but it does not appear that water can
10641,PART II.,"dissolve any of the lead. Nor does it readily rust in the air, and hence"
10642,PART II.,"it is much used to cover buildings with, as well as to line spouts and"
10643,PART II.,"water-courses. For these purposes the lead is cast into sheets, which"
10644,PART II.,are easily cut and hammered into any shape.
10645,PART II.,
10646,PART II.,"_Har._ Bullets and shot, too, are made of lead."
10647,PART II.,
10648,PART II.,_Tut._ They are; and in this way they are ten times more destructive
10649,PART II.,than as a poison.
10650,PART II.,
10651,PART II.,_Geo._ I think lead seems to be more used than any metal except iron.
10652,PART II.,
10653,PART II.,_Tut._ It is; and the plenty of it in our country is a great benefit to
10654,PART II.,"us, both for domestic use, and as an article that brings in much profit"
10655,PART II.,by exportation.
10656,PART II.,
10657,PART II.,_Geo._ Where are our principal lead mines?
10658,PART II.,
10659,PART II.,"_Tut._ They are much scattered about. The west of England produces some,"
10660,PART II.,"in Cornwall, Devonshire, and Somersetshire. Wales affords a large"
10661,PART II.,"quantity. Derbyshire has long been noted for its lead mines, and so have"
10662,PART II.,Northumberland and Durham. And there are considerable ones in the
10663,PART II.,southern part of Scotland. Now do you recollect another metal to be
10664,PART II.,spoken about?
10665,PART II.,
10666,PART II.,_Geo._ Tin.
10667,PART II.,
10668,PART II.,"_Tut._ True. Tin resembles lead in colour, but has a more silvery"
10669,PART II.,"whiteness. It is soft and flexible, like lead, but is distinguished by"
10670,PART II.,"the crackling noise it makes on being bent. It melts as easily as lead,"
10671,PART II.,and also is readily oxidized by keeping it in the fire. It is the
10672,PART II.,"lightest of the metals, being only seven times as heavy as water. It may"
10673,PART II.,"be beaten into a thin leaf, but not drawn out to wire."
10674,PART II.,
10675,PART II.,_Geo._ Is tin of much use?
10676,PART II.,
10677,PART II.,"_Tut._ It is not often used by itself, but very frequently in"
10678,PART II.,"conjunction with other metals. As tin is little liable to rust, or to be"
10679,PART II.,"corroded by common liquors, it is employed for a lining or coating of"
10680,PART II.,vessels made of copper or iron. The saucepans and kettles in the
10681,PART II.,"kitchen, you know, are all tinned."
10682,PART II.,
10683,PART II.,_Geo._ Yes; how is it done?
10684,PART II.,
10685,PART II.,"_Tut._ By melting the tin, and spreading it upon the surface of the"
10686,PART II.,"copper, which is first heated, in order to make the tin adhere."
10687,PART II.,
10688,PART II.,_Geo._ But what are the vessels made at the tinman’s? Are they not all
10689,PART II.,tin?
10690,PART II.,
10691,PART II.,"_Tut._ No. _Tinned_ ware, as it is properly called, is made of thin iron"
10692,PART II.,"plates, coated over with tin by dipping them into a vessel full of"
10693,PART II.,"melted tin. These plates are afterward cut and bent to proper shapes,"
10694,PART II.,and the joinings are soldered together with a mixture of tin and other
10695,PART II.,metals. Another similar use of tin is in what is called the silvering of
10696,PART II.,pins.
10697,PART II.,
10698,PART II.,_Geo._ What—is not that real silvering?
10699,PART II.,
10700,PART II.,"_Tut._ No. The pins which are made of brass wire, after being pointed"
10701,PART II.,"and headed, are boiled in hot water, in which grain-tin is put along"
10702,PART II.,"with tartar, which is a crust that collects on the inside of wine casks."
10703,PART II.,"The tartar dissolves some of the tin, and makes it adhere to the surface"
10704,PART II.,"of the pins, and thus thousands are covered in an instant."
10705,PART II.,
10706,PART II.,_Har._ That is as clever as what you told us of the gilding of buttons!
10707,PART II.,
10708,PART II.,_Tut._ It is. Another purpose for which great quantities of tin used to
10709,PART II.,be employed was the making of pewter. The best pewter consists chiefly
10710,PART II.,"of tin, with a small mixture of other metals to harden it; and the"
10711,PART II.,London pewter was brought to such perfection as to look almost as well
10712,PART II.,as silver.
10713,PART II.,
10714,PART II.,_Geo._ I can just remember a long row of pewter plates at my
10715,PART II.,grandmother’s.
10716,PART II.,
10717,PART II.,_Tut._ You may. In her time all the plates and dishes for the table were
10718,PART II.,"made of pewter, and a handsome range of pewter shelves was thought a"
10719,PART II.,"capital ornament for a kitchen. At present, this trade is almost come to"
10720,PART II.,"nothing, through the use of earthenware and china; and pewter is"
10721,PART II.,"employed for little but the worms of stills, and barbers’ basins, and"
10722,PART II.,porter-pots. But a good deal is still exported. Tin is likewise an
10723,PART II.,"ingredient in other mixed metals for various purposes, but, on the"
10724,PART II.,"whole, less of it is used than of the other common metals."
10725,PART II.,
10726,PART II.,_Geo._ Is not England more famous for tin than any other country? I have
10727,PART II.,read of the Phoenicians trading here for it in very early times.
10728,PART II.,
10729,PART II.,_Tut._ They did; and tin is still a very valuable article of export from
10730,PART II.,England. Much of it is sent as far as China. The tin mines are chiefly
10731,PART II.,"in Cornwall, England, and I believe they are the most productive of any"
10732,PART II.,in Europe. Very fine tin is also got in the peninsula of Malacca in the
10733,PART II.,East Indies. Well—we have now gone through the metals.
10734,PART II.,
10735,PART II.,_Geo._ But you said nothing about a kind of metal called zinc.
10736,PART II.,
10737,PART II.,_Tut._ That is one of another class of mineral substances called
10738,PART II.,"_semi-metals_. These resemble metals in every quality but ductility, of"
10739,PART II.,"which they are almost wholly destitute, and for want of it they can"
10740,PART II.,"seldom be used in the arts, except when joined with metals."
10741,PART II.,
10742,PART II.,_Geo._ Are there many of them?
10743,PART II.,
10744,PART II.,"_Tut._ Yes, several; but we will not talk of them till I have taken some"
10745,PART II.,"opportunity of showing them to you, for probably you may never have seen"
10746,PART II.,any of them. Now try to repeat the names of all the metals to me in the
10747,PART II.,order of their weight.
10748,PART II.,
10749,PART II.,_Har._ There is first _gold_.
10750,PART II.,
10751,PART II.,"_Geo._ Then _quicksilver_, _lead_, _silver_."
10752,PART II.,
10753,PART II.,"_Har._ _Copper_, _iron_, _tin_."
10754,PART II.,
10755,PART II.,_Tut._ Very right. Now I must tell you of an old fancy that chymists
10756,PART II.,have had of christening these metals by the names of the heavenly
10757,PART II.,"bodies. They have called gold _Sol_, or the sun."
10758,PART II.,
10759,PART II.,_Geo._ That is suitable enough to its colour and brightness.
10760,PART II.,
10761,PART II.,"_Har._ Then silver should be the moon, for I have heard moonlight called"
10762,PART II.,of a silvery hue.
10763,PART II.,
10764,PART II.,_Tut._ True; and they have named it so. It is _Luna_. Quicksilver is
10765,PART II.,"_Mercury_, so named probably from its great propensity to dance and jump"
10766,PART II.,"about, for _Mercury_, you know, was very nimble."
10767,PART II.,
10768,PART II.,_Geo._ Yes—he had wings to his heels.
10769,PART II.,
10770,PART II.,_Tut._ Copper is _Venus_.
10771,PART II.,
10772,PART II.,_Geo._ _Venus!_ surely it is scarcely beautiful enough for that.
10773,PART II.,
10774,PART II.,_Tut._ But they had disposed of the most beautiful ones before. Iron is
10775,PART II.,Mars.
10776,PART II.,
10777,PART II.,"_Har._ That is right enough, because swords are made of iron."
10778,PART II.,
10779,PART II.,"_Tut._ True. Then tin is _Jupiter_, and lead _Saturn_. I suppose only to"
10780,PART II.,make out the number. Yet the dulness of lead might be thought to agree
10781,PART II.,"with that planet which is most remote from the sun. These names,"
10782,PART II.,"childish as they may seem, are worth remembering, since chymists and"
10783,PART II.,physicians still apply them to many preparations of the various metals.
10784,PART II.,"You will, probably, often hear of _martial_, _lunar_, _mercurial_, and"
10785,PART II.,_saturnine_; and you may now know what they mean.
10786,PART II.,
10787,PART II.,_Geo._ I think the knowledge of metals seems more useful than all you
10788,PART II.,have told us about plants.
10789,PART II.,
10790,PART II.,"_Tut._ I don’t know that. Many nations make no use at all of metals, but"
10791,PART II.,there are none which do not owe a great part of their subsistence to
10792,PART II.,"vegetables. However, without inquiring what parts of natural knowledge"
10793,PART II.,"are _most_ useful, you may be assured of this, that all are useful in"
10794,PART II.,some degree or other; and there are few things that give one man greater
10795,PART II.,"superiority over another, than the extent and accuracy of his knowledge"
10796,PART II.,"in these particulars. One person passes all his life upon the earth, a"
10797,PART II.,stranger to it; while another finds himself at home everywhere.

10832,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10833,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Why, that is just the round Robert has been taking, and he"

10836,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Will._ I wonder at that. I am sure I hardly took a step that did not

10841,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10842,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I will, sir. The lane leading to the heath, you know, is close"

10844,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","However, I spied a curious thing enough in the hedge. It was an old"
10845,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","crab-tree, out of which grew a great bunch of something green, quite"
10846,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",different from the tree itself. Here is a branch of it.
10847,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10848,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Ah! this is mistletoe, a plant of great fame for the use made"
10849,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of it by the Druids of old, in their religious rites and incantations."
10850,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","It bears a very slimy white berry, of which bird-lime may be made,"
10851,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",whence its Latin name of _Viscus_. It is one of those plants which do

10853,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","other plants; whence they have been humorously styled _parasitical_, as"

10856,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10857,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ A little farther on I saw a green woodpecker fly to a tree, and"

10859,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10860,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ That was to seek for insects in the bark, on which they live."
10861,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","They bore holes with their strong bills for that purpose, and do much"

10869,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ When I got upon the open heath, how charming it was! The air"
10870,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","seemed so fresh, and the prospect on every side so free and unbounded!"

10876,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10877,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ That I will readily.
10878,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10879,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I saw, too, several birds that were new to me. There was a"
10880,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","pretty grayish one, of the size of a lark, that was hopping about some"

10883,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10884,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ That was a wheat-ear. They are reckoned very delicious birds
10885,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","to eat, and frequent the open downs in Sussex, and some other counties,"
10886,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",in great numbers.
10887,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10888,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ There was a flock of lapwings, upon a marshy part of the heath,"
10889,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","that amused me much. As I came near them, some of them kept flying round"
10890,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","and round just over my head, and crying _pewit_ so distinctly, one might"
10891,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","almost fancy they spoke. I thought I should have caught one of them, for"
10892,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","he flew as if one of his wings was broken, and often tumbled close to"
10893,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","the ground; but as I came near, he always made a shift to get away."
10894,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10895,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Ha, ha! you were finely taken in then! This was all an"
10896,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",artifice of the bird to entice you away from its nest; for they build
10897,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","upon the bare ground, and their nests would easily be observed, did they"
10898,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",not draw off the attention of intruders by their loud cries and

10901,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I wish I had known that, for he led me a long chase often over"

10903,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","man and a boy who were cutting and piling up turf for fuel, and I had a"
10904,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","good deal of talk with them about the manner of preparing the turf, and"
10905,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","the price it sells at. They gave me, too, a creature I never saw"
10906,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","before—a young viper, which they had just killed, together with its dam."
10907,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","I have seen several common snakes, but this is thicker in proportion,"
10908,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",and of a darker colour than they are.
10909,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10910,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ True. Vipers frequent those turfy, boggy grounds pretty much,"
10911,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",and I have known several turf-cutters bitten by them.

10913,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ They are very venomous, are they not?"
10914,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10915,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Enough so to make their wounds painful and dangerous, though"

10917,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10918,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Will._ Well—I then took my course up to the windmill on the mount. I
10919,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","climbed up the steps of the mill, in order to get a better view of the"
10920,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",country round. What an extensive prospect! I counted fifteen
10921,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",church-steeples; and I saw several gentlemen’s houses peeping out from
10922,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",the midst of green woods and plantations; and I could trace the windings
10923,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of the river all along the low grounds, till it was lost behind a ridge"
10924,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of hills. But I’ll tell you what I mean to do, sir, if you will give me"
10925,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",leave.
10926,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10927,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ What is that?
10928,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10929,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I will go again, and take with me Cary’s county-map, by which I"

10936,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","the hill is called Camp-mount, there might probably be some remains of"
10937,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",ditches and mounds with which I have read that camps were surrounded.
10938,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",And I really believe I discovered something of that sort running round
10939,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",one side of the mount.
10940,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10941,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ Very likely you might. I know antiquaries have described such
10942,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","remains as existing there, which some suppose to be Roman, others"
10943,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","Danish; we will examine them farther, when we go."
10944,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10945,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ From the hill I went straight down to the meadows below, and"
10946,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",walked on the side of a brook that runs into the river. It was all
10947,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","bordered with reeds and flags and tall towering plants, quite different"
10948,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",from those I had seen on the heath. As I was getting down the bank to
10949,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","reach one of them, I heard something plunge into the water near me. It"
10950,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","was a large water-rat, and I saw it swim over to the other side, and go"
10951,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",into its hole. There were a great many large dragon-flies all about the
10952,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","stream; I caught one of the finest, and have got him here in a leaf. But"
10953,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","how I longed to catch a bird that I saw hovering over the water, and"
10954,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",every now and then darting down into it! It was all over a mixture of
10955,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",the most beautiful green and blue with some orange colour. It was
10956,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","somewhat less than a thrush, and had a large head and bill, and a short"
10957,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",tail.
10958,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10959,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ I can tell you what that bird was—a kingfisher; the celebrated
10960,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","halcyon of the ancients, about which so many tales are told. It lives on"
10961,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","fish, which it catches in the manner you saw. It builds in holes in the"
10962,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","banks, and is a shy retired bird, never to be seen far from the stream"
10963,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",where it inhabits.
10964,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10965,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I must try to get another sight of him, for I never saw a bird"
10966,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",that pleased me so much. Well—I followed this little brook till it
10967,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","entered the river, and then took the path that runs along the bank. On"
10968,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",the opposite side I observed several little birds running along the
10969,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","shore, and making a piping noise. They were brown and white, and about"
10970,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",as big as a snipe.
10971,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10972,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ I suppose they were sand-pipers, one of the numerous family of"

10976,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ There were a great many swallows, too, sporting upon the surface"
10977,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of the water, that entertained me with their motions. Sometimes they"
10978,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","dashed into the stream; sometimes they pursued one another so quick,"
10979,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","that the eye could scarcely follow them. In one place, where a high,"
10980,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","steep sandbank rose directly above the river, I observed many of them go"
10981,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",in and out of holes with which the bank was bored full.
10982,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10983,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Those were sand-martens, the smallest of our species of"
10984,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","swallows. They are of a mouse-colour above, and white beneath. They make"
10985,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","their nests and bring up their young in these holes, which run a great"
10986,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","depth, and, by their situation, are secure from all plunderers."
10987,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10988,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Will._ A little farther I saw a man in a boat who was catching eels in
10989,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","an odd way. He had a long pole with broad iron prongs at the end, just"
10990,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","like Neptune’s trident, only there were five instead of three. This he"
10991,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","pushed straight down among the mud in the deepest parts of the river,"
10992,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",and fetched up the eels sticking between the prongs.
10993,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10994,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ I have seen this method. It is called spearing of eels.
10995,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
10996,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ While I was looking at him, a heron came flying over my head,"
10997,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","with his large flagging wings. He lit at the next turn of the river, and"
10998,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",I crept softly behind the bank to watch his motions. He had waded into
10999,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","the water as far as his long legs would carry him, and was standing with"
11000,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","his neck drawn in, looking intently on the stream. Presently, he darted"
11001,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","his long bill as quick as lightning into the water, and drew out a fish,"
11002,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",which he swallowed. I saw him catch another in the same manner. He then
11003,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","took alarm at some noise I made, and flew away slowly to a wood at some"
11004,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","distance, where he settled."
11005,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11006,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Probably his nest was there, for herons build upon the"
11007,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","loftiest trees they can find, and sometimes in society together, like"
11008,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","rooks. Formerly, when these birds were valued for the amusement of"
11009,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","hawking, many gentlemen had their _heronries_, and a few are still"
11010,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",remaining.
11011,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11012,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Will._ I think they are the largest wild birds we have.
11013,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11014,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ They are of a great length and spread of wing, but their"
11015,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",bodies are comparatively small.
11016,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11017,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I then turned homeward across the meadows, where I stopped a"
11018,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",while to look at a large flock of starlings which kept flying about at
11019,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",no great distance. I could not tell at first what to make of them; for
11020,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","they rose all together from the ground as thick as a swarm of bees, and"
11021,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","formed themselves into a kind of black cloud, hovering over the field."
11022,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","After having a short round they settled again, and presently rose again"
11023,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",in the same manner. I dare say there were hundreds of them.
11024,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11025,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ Perhaps so, for in the fenny countries their flocks are so"
11026,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",numerous as to break down whole acres of reeds by settling on them. This
11027,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",disposition of starlings to fly in close swarms was remarked even by
11028,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","Homer, who compares the foe flying from one of his heroes, to a _cloud_"
11029,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",of stares retiring dismayed at the approach of the hawk.

11031,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ After I had left the meadows, I crossed the cornfields in the"
11032,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","way to our house, and passed by a deep marl-pit. Looking into it, I saw"
11033,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",in one of the sides a cluster of what I took to be shells; and upon
11034,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","going down, I picked up a clod of marl, which was quite full of them;"
11035,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",but how sea-shells could get there I cannot imagine.
11036,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11037,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ I do not wonder at your surprise, since many philosophers have"
11038,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",been much perplexed to account for the same appearance. It is not
11039,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",uncommon to find great quantities of shells and relics of marine animals
11040,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","even in the bowels of high mountains, very remote from the sea. They are"
11041,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",certainly proofs that the earth was once in a very different state from
11042,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","what it is at present; but in what manner, and how long ago these"
11043,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","changes took place, can only be guessed at."
11044,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11045,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Will._ I got to the high field next our house just as the sun was
11046,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","setting, and I stood looking at it till it was quite lost. What a"
11047,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","glorious sight! The clouds were tinged purple, and crimson, and yellow,"
11048,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of all shades and hues, and the clear sky varied from blue to a fine"
11049,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",green at the horizon. But how large the sun appears just as it sets! I
11050,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",think it seems twice as big as when it is overhead.
11051,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11052,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ It does so; and you may probably have observed the same
11053,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",apparent enlargement of the moon at its rising.
11054,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11055,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Will._ I have; but pray, what is the reason of this?"
11056,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11057,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Mr. An._ It is an optical deception, depending upon principles which I"
11058,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",cannot well explain to you till you know more of that branch of science.
11059,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",But what a number of new ideas this afternoon’s walk has afforded you! I
11060,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","do not wonder that you found it amusing: it has been very instructive,"
11061,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","too. Did _you_ see nothing of all these sights, Robert?"
11062,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11063,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Rob._ I saw some of them, but I did not take particular notice of them."
11064,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11065,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ Why not?
11066,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11067,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","_Rob._ I don’t know. I did not care about them, and I made the best of"
11068,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",my way home.
11069,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",
11070,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",_Mr. An._ That would have been right if you had been sent with a
11071,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","message; but as you only walked for amusement, it would have been wiser"
11072,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",to have sought out as many sources of it as possible. But so it is—one
11073,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","man walks through the world with his eyes open, and another with them"
11074,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",shut; and upon this difference depends all the superiority of knowledge
11075,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",the one acquires above the other. I have known sailors who had been in
11076,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","all the quarters of the world, and could tell you nothing but the signs"
11077,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","of the tippling-houses they frequented in different ports, and the price"
11078,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","and quality of the liquor. On the other hand, a Franklin could not cross"
11079,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.",the channel without making some observations useful to mankind. While
11080,"EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.","many a vacant, thoughtless youth is whirled throughout Europe without"

11098,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Papa_—_Lucy_.
11099,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11100,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11101,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Papa._ You remember, Lucy, that I explained to you some time ago what"
11102,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,was the cause that things fell to the ground.
11103,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11104,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lucy._ O yes; it was because the ground drew them to it.
11105,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11106,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ True. That is a consequence of the universal law in nature, that"
11107,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,bodies attract each other in proportion to their bulk. So a very small
11108,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"thing in the neighbourhood of a very large one, always tends to go to"
11109,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"it, if not prevented by some or other power. Well—you know I told you"
11110,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,that the sun was a ball a vast many times bigger than the ball we
11111,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"inhabit, called the earth; upon which you properly asked, how then it"
11112,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,happened that the earth did not fall into the sun.
11113,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11114,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ And why does it not?
11115,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11116,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ That I am going to explain to you. You have seen your brother
11117,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"whirl round an ivory ball tied to the end of a string, which he held in"
11118,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,his hand.
11119,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11120,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ Yes; and I have done it myself, too."
11121,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11122,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ Well, then—you felt that the ball was continually pulling, as if"
11123,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,it tried to make its escape?
11124,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11125,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ Yes; and one my brother was swinging _did_ make its escape, and"
11126,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,flew through the sash.
11127,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11128,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ It did so. That was a lesson, in the _centrifugal_ motion, or that"
11129,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"power by which a body thus whirled, continually endeavours to fly off"
11130,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,from the centre round which it moves. This is owing to the force or
11131,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"impulse you give it at setting out, as if you were going to throw it"
11132,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"away from you. The string by which you hold it, on the contrary, is the"
11133,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"power which keeps the ball toward the centre, called the _centripetal_"
11134,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,power. Thus you see there are two powers acting upon the ball at the
11135,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"same time, one to make it fly off, the other to hold it in; and the"
11136,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"consequence is, that it moves directly according to neither, but between"
11137,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"both; that is, round and round. This it continues to do while you swing"
11138,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"it properly; but if the string breaks or slips off, away flies the ball;"
11139,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"on the other hand, if you cease to give it the whirling force, it falls"
11140,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,toward your hand.
11141,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11142,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ I understand all this.
11143,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11144,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ I will give you another instance of this double force acting at
11145,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,the same time. Do not you remember seeing some curious feats of
11146,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,horsemanship?
11147,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11148,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ Yes.
11149,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11150,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ One of them was, that a man standing with one leg upon the saddle,"
11151,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"and riding full speed, threw up balls into the air, and catched them as"
11152,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,they fell.
11153,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11154,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ I remember it very well.
11155,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11156,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ Perhaps you would have expected these balls to have fallen behind
11157,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"him, as he was going at such a rate?"
11158,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11159,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ So I did.
11160,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11161,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ But you saw that they fell into his hand as directly as if he had
11162,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,been standing quite still. That was because at the instant he threw them
11163,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"up, they received the motion of the horse straight forward as well as"
11164,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"the upright motion that he gave them, so that they made a slanting line"
11165,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"through the air, and came down in the same place they would have reached"
11166,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,if he had held them in his hand all the while.
11167,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11168,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ That is very curious, indeed!"
11169,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11170,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ In the same manner you may have observed, in riding in a carriage,"
11171,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"that if you throw anything out of the window, it falls directly"
11172,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"opposite, just as if the carriage was standing still, and is not left"
11173,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,behind you.
11174,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11175,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ I will try that the next time I ride in one.
11176,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11177,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ You are then to imagine the sun to be a mighty mass of matter,"
11178,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"many thousand times bigger than our earth, placed in the centre, quiet"
11179,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"and unmoved. You are to conceive our earth, as soon as created, launched"
11180,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"with vast force in a straight line, as if it were a bowl on a green. It"
11181,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"would have flown off in this line for ever, through the boundless"
11182,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"regions of space, had it not at the same instant received a pull from"
11183,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"the sun by its attraction. By the wonderful skill of the Creator, these"
11184,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,two forces were made exactly to counterbalance each other; so that just
11185,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"as much as the earth, from the original motion given to it, tends to fly"
11186,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"forward, just so much the sun draws it to the centre; and the"
11187,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"consequence is, that it takes a course between the two, which is a"
11188,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,circle round and round the sun.
11189,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11190,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ But if the earth was set a rolling like a bowl upon a green, I"
11191,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"should think it would stop of itself, as the bowl does."
11192,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11193,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ The bowl stops because it is continually rubbing against the
11194,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"ground, which checks its motion, but the ball of the earth moves in"
11195,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"empty space, where there is nothing to stop it."
11196,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11197,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ But if I throw a ball through the air, it will not go on for ever,"
11198,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,but it will come down to the ground.
11199,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11200,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ That is because the force with which you can throw it is much less
11201,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,than the force by which it is drawn to the earth. But there is another
11202,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"reason, too, which is the resistance of the air. This space all round us"
11203,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,and over us is not empty space; it is quite full of a thin transparent
11204,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,fluid called air.
11205,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11206,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ Is it?
11207,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11208,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ Yes. If you move your hand quickly through it, you will find"
11209,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"something resisting you, though in a slight degree. And the wind, you"
11210,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"well know, is capable of pressing against anything with almost"
11211,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,irresistible force; and yet wind is nothing but a quantity of air put
11212,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"into violent motion. Everything, then, that moves through the air is"
11213,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"continually obliged to push some of this fluid out of the way, by which"
11214,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,means it is constantly losing part of its motion.
11215,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11216,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ Then the earth would do the same?
11217,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11218,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ No; for it moves in _empty space_.
11219,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11220,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ What, does it not move through the air?"
11221,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11222,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ The earth does not move _through_ the air, but carries the air"
11223,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,along with it. All the air is contained in what is called the
11224,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_atmosphere_, which you may compare to a kind of mist or fog clinging"
11225,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"all round to the ball of the earth, and reaching a certain distance"
11226,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"above it, which has been calculated at above forty-five miles."
11227,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11228,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ That is above the clouds, then."
11229,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11230,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ Yes: all the clouds are within the atmosphere, for they are"
11231,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,supported by the air. Well—this atmosphere rolls about along with the
11232,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"earth, as if it were a part of it, and moves with it through the sky,"
11233,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,which is a vast field of empty space. In this immense space are all the

11235,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"nothing to stop them, and therefore they continually go on, by means of"

11237,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11238,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Lu._ Do not some of the stars move round the sun, as well as our earth?"
11239,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11240,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Pa._ Yes; those that are called _planets_. These are all subject to the
11241,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,same laws of motion with our earth. They are attracted by the sun as
11242,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"their centre, and form, along with the earth, that assemblage of worlds,"
11243,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,which is called the _solar system_.
11244,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11245,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ Is the moon one of them?
11246,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11247,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"_Pa._ The moon is called a _secondary_ planet, because its immediate"
11248,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"connexion is with our earth, round which it rolls, as we do round the"
11249,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"sun. It, however, accompanies our earth on its journey round the sun."
11250,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"But I will tell you more about its motion, and about the other planets"
11251,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,"and stars another time. It is enough at present, if you thoroughly"
11252,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,understand what I have been describing.
11253,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,
11254,WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.,_Lu._ I think I do.

11261,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tutor_—_George_—_Harry_.
11262,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11263,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11264,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Harry._ What plant is that man gathering under the hedge?
11265,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11266,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_George._ I don’t know; but the boys call the stalks _hexes_, and blow"
11267,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,through them.
11268,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11269,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I have seen them; but I want to know the plant.
11270,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11271,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ Will you please to tell us, sir, what it is?"
11272,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11273,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tutor._ It is hemlock.
11274,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11275,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Hemlock is poison is it not?
11276,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11277,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes, in some degree; and it is also a medicine; that man is"
11278,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,gathering it for the apothecaries.
11279,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11280,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I should like to know it.
11281,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11282,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Well then—go and bring one.
11283,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11284,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,[Harry _fetches it_.
11285,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11286,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ I think I have seen a great many of this sort.
11287,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11288,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Perhaps you may; but there are many other kinds of plants
11289,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,extremely like it. It is one of a large family called the
11290,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_umbelliferous_, which contains both food, physic, and poison. It will"
11291,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"be worth while for you to know something about them, so let us examine"
11292,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"this hemlock closely. You see this tall hollow stalk, which divides into"
11293,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"several branches, from each of which spring spokes or _rundles_, as they"
11294,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"are called, of flower-stalks. You see they are like rays from a circle,"
11295,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,or the spokes of a wheel.
11296,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11297,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ Or like the sticks of an umbrella.
11298,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11299,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True; and they are called _umbels_, which has the same"
11300,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"derivation. If you pursue one of these rundles or umbels, you will find"
11301,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"that each stick or spoke terminates in another set of smaller stalks,"
11302,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,each of which bears a single small flower.
11303,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11304,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ They are small ones, indeed!"
11305,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11306,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ But if you look sharply, I dare say your eyes are good enough to"
11307,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"distinguish that they are divided into five leaves, and furnished with"
11308,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,five chives and two pistils in the middle.
11309,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11310,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I can see them.
11311,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11312,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ And so can I.
11313,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11314,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ The pistils are succeeded by a sort of fruit, which is a"
11315,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"twin-seed joined in the middle, as you may see in this rundle that is"
11316,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,past flowering. Here I divide one of them into two.
11317,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11318,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Would each of these grow?
11319,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11320,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes. Well, this is the structure of the flowering part of the"
11321,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,umbelliferous tribe. Now for the leaf. Pluck one.
11322,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11323,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ Is this one leaf, or many?"
11324,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11325,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ It is properly one, but it is cut and divided into many portions."
11326,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,From this mid-rib spring smaller leaves set opposite each other; and
11327,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"from the rib of each of these proceed others, which themselves are also"
11328,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,divided. These are called doubly or trebly pinnated leaves; and most of
11329,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"the umbelliferous plants, but not all, have leaves of this kind."
11330,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11331,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ It is like a parsley-leaf.
11332,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11333,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True—and parsley is one of the same tribe, and hemlock and others"
11334,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,are sometimes mistaken for it.
11335,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11336,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ How curiously the stalk of this hemlock is spotted!
11337,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11338,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Yes. That is one of the marks by which it is known. It is also
11339,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"distinguished by its peculiar smell, and by other circumstances which"
11340,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,you can only understand when you have compared a number of the tribe. I
11341,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"will now tell you about some others, the names of which you are probably"
11342,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"acquainted with. In the first place, there are carrots and parsnips."
11343,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11344,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ Carrots and parsnips!—they are not poisons, I am sure."
11345,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11346,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I remember, now, that carrots have such a leaf as this."
11347,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11348,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ They have. It is the _roots_ of these, you know, that are eaten."
11349,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"But we eat the _leaves_ of parsley and fennel, which are of the same"
11350,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"class. Celery is another, the _stalks_ of which are chiefly used, made"
11351,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,white by trenching up the earth about them. The stalks of angelica are
11352,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,used differently.
11353,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11354,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ I know how—candied.
11355,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11356,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Yes. Then there are many of which the _seeds_ are used. There is
11357,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,caraway.
11358,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11359,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ What, the seeds that are put into cakes and comfits?"
11360,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11361,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Yes. They are warm and pungent to the taste; and so are the seeds
11362,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"of many others of the umbelliferous plants, as coriander, fennel, wild"
11363,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"carrot, angelica, anise, cummin, and dill. All these are employed in"
11364,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"food or medicine, and are good in warming or strengthening the stomach."
11365,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11366,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ Those are pleasant medicines enough.
11367,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11368,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ They are; but you will not say the same of some others of the
11369,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"class, which are noted medicines too; such as the plant yielding"
11370,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"asafœtida, and several more, from which what are called the fetid gums"
11371,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,are produced.
11372,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11373,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ Asafœtida!—that’s nasty stuff, I know; does it grow here?"
11374,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11375,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ No; and most of the sweet seeds I before mentioned come from
11376,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,abroad too. Now I will tell you of some of the poisons.
11377,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11378,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ Hemlock is one that we know already.
11379,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11380,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes. Then there is another kind that grows in the water, and is"
11381,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"more poisonous, called water-hemlock. Another is a large plant growing"
11382,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"in ditches, with leaves extremely like celery, called hemlock-dropwort."
11383,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"Another, common in drier situations, and distinguished by leaves less"
11384,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"divided than most of the class, is cow-parsnip, or madnep. Of some of"
11385,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"these the leaves, of others the root, is most poisonous. Their effects"
11386,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"are to make the head giddy, bring on stupidity or delirium, and cause"
11387,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,violent sickness. The Athenians used to put criminals to death by making
11388,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"them drink the juice of a kind of hemlock growing in that country, as"
11389,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"you may read in the life of that excellent philosopher, Socrates, who"
11390,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,was killed in that manner.
11391,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11392,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ What was he killed for?
11393,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11394,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Because he was wiser and better than his fellow-citizens. Among
11395,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,us it is only by accident that mischief is done by these plants. I
11396,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"remember a melancholy instance of a poor boy, who, in rambling about the"
11397,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"fields with his little brothers and sisters, chanced to meet with a root"
11398,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"of hemlock-dropwort. It looked so white and nice, that he was tempted to"
11399,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"eat a good deal of it. The other children also ate some, but not so"
11400,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"much. When they got home they were all taken very ill. The eldest boy,"
11401,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"who had eaten most, died in great agony. The others recovered, after"
11402,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,suffering a great deal.
11403,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11404,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ Is there any way of preventing their bad effects?
11405,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11406,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ The best way is to clear the stomach as soon as possible by a
11407,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"strong vomit and large draughts of warm water. After that, vinegar is"
11408,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,useful in removing the disorder of the head.
11409,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11410,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Har._ But are the roots sweet and pleasant, that people should be"
11411,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,tempted to eat them?
11412,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11413,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Several of them are. There is a small plant of the tribe, the"
11414,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"root of which is much sought after by boys, who dig for it with their"
11415,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"knives It is round, and called earth-nut, or pig-nut."
11416,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11417,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ But that’s not poison, I suppose?"
11418,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11419,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ No; but it is not very wholesome. I believe, however, that the"
11420,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,roots of the most poisonous become innocent by boiling. I have heard
11421,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,that boiled hemlock roots are as good as carrots.
11422,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11423,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I think I should not like to eat them, however. But pray, why"
11424,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,should there be any poisons at all?
11425,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11426,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ What we call poisons, are only hurtful to particular animals."
11427,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"They are the proper food of others, and no doubt do more good than hurt"
11428,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,in the creation. Most of the things that are poisonous to us in large
11429,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"quantities, are useful medicines in small ones; and we have reason"
11430,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"bestowed upon _us_, to guard us against mischief. Other animals, in"
11431,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"general, refuse by instinct what would prove hurtful to them. You see"
11432,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,beneath yonder hedge a great crop of tall flourishing plants with white
11433,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"flowers. They are of the umbelliferous family, and are called wild"
11434,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"cicely, or cow-weed. The latter name is given them, because the cows"
11435,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"will not touch them, though the pasture be ever so bare."
11436,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11437,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Har._ Would they poison them?
11438,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11439,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ Perhaps they would: at least they are not proper food for them.
11440,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"We will go and examine them, and I will show you how they differ from"
11441,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"hemlock, for which they are sometimes mistaken."
11442,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11443,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I should like to get some of these plants, and dry them."
11444,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11445,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"_Tut._ You shall, and write down the names of them all, and learn to"
11446,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,know the innocent from the hurtful.
11447,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11448,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Geo._ That will be very useful.
11449,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,
11450,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,_Tut._ It will. Remember now the general character of the umbelliferous
11451,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"plants. The flower-stalks are divided into spokes or umbels, which are"
11452,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"again divided into others, each of them terminated by a small,"
11453,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"five-leaved flower, having five chives and two pistils, succeeded by a"
11454,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,twin-seed. Their leaves are generally finely divided. You will soon know
11455,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"them, after having examined two or three of the tribe. Remember, too,"
11456,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,"that they are a _suspicious race_, and not to be made free with till you"
11457,THE UMBELLIFEROUS PLANTS.,are well acquainted with them.

11470,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Charles._ I was thinking, sir, how happy it is for us that we are not"

11472,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11473,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ It is very right to be sensible of all the advantages that
11474,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","Providence has bestowed upon us in this world, and I commend you for"
11475,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",reflecting on them with gratitude. But what particular circumstance of
11476,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",comparison between our condition and his struck you most just now?
11477,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11478,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ O, almost everything! I could not bear to live in such a poor"
11479,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","house, with a cold clay floor, and half the windows stopped with paper."
11480,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",Then how poorly he and his children are dressed! and I dare say they
11481,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",must live as poorly too.
11482,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11483,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ These things would be grievous enough to you, I do not doubt,"
11484,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",because you have been accustomed to a very different way of living. But
11485,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","if they are healthy and contented, I don’t know that we have much more"

11488,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",the cold; and nature wants little more.
11489,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11490,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ But, what a ragged, barefooted fellow the boy at the door was!"
11491,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11492,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ He was—but did you observe his ruddy cheeks, and his stout"
11493,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","legs, and the smiling grin upon his countenance? It is my opinion he"
11494,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","would beat you in running, though he is half the head less; and I dare"
11495,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","say he never cried because he did not know what to do with himself, in"
11496,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",his life.
11497,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11498,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ But, sir, you have often told me that the mind is the noblest part"
11499,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","of man; and these poor creatures, I am sure, can have no opportunity to"
11500,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","improve their minds. They must be as ignorant as the brutes, almost."
11501,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11502,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ Why so? Do you think there is no knowledge to be got but from
11503,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",books; or that a weaver cannot teach his children right from wrong?
11504,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11505,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ Not if he has never learned himself.
11506,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11507,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ True—but I hope the country we live in is not so unfriendly to

11530,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11531,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ Yes; only there are somewhat different contrivances for

11534,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11535,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ O—not for a great while?
11536,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11537,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ But I suppose you could easily turn the wheel, and draw out"
11538,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",threads like that good woman?
11539,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11540,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ Not without some practice, I fancy. But what is that boy doing?"
11541,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11542,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ He is cutting pegs for the shoemakers, master."
11543,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11544,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ How quick he does them!
11545,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11546,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ It is but poor employment, but better than being idle. The first"
11547,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","lesson I teach my children is, that their hands were made to get their"
11548,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",bread with.
11549,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11550,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ And a very good lesson, too."
11551,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11552,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ What is this heap of twigs for?
11553,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11554,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ Why, master, my biggest boy and girl have learned a little how to"
11555,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","make basket-work, so I have got them a few osiers to employ them at"
11556,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",leisure hours. That bird-cage is their making: and the back of that
11557,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",chair in which their grandmother sits.
11558,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11559,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ Is not that cleverly done, papa?"
11560,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11561,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ It is, indeed. Here are several arts, you see, in this house,"
11562,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",which both you and I should be much puzzled to set about. But there are
11563,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","some books, too, I perceive."
11564,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11565,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ Here is a bible, and a testament, and a prayer-book, and a"
11566,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","spelling book, and a volume of the Gardener’s Dictionary."
11567,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11568,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ And how many of your family can read, my friend?"
11569,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11570,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ All the children but the two youngest can read a little, sir; but"
11571,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","Meg, there, is the best scholar among us. She reads us a chapter in the"
11572,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","Testament every morning, and very well, too, though I say it."
11573,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11574,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ Do you hear that, Charles?"
11575,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11576,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ I do, sir. Here’s an almanac, too, against the wall; and here are"
11577,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","my favourite ballads of the Children in the Wood, and Chevy-chase."
11578,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11579,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ I let the children paste them up, sir, and a few more that have"
11580,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","no harm in them. There’s Hearts of Oak, and Rule Britannia, and Robin"
11581,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",Gray.
11582,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11583,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ A very good choice, indeed. I see you have a pretty garden"
11584,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",there behind the house.
11585,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11586,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ It is only a little spot, sir; but it serves for some amusement,"
11587,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",and use too.
11588,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11589,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ What beautiful stocks and wall-flowers! We have none so fine in
11590,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",our garden.
11591,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11592,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ Why, master, to say the truth, we are rather proud of them. I"
11593,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","have got a way of cultivating them, that I believe few besides myself"
11594,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",are acquainted with; and on Sundays I have plenty of visiters to come
11595,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",and admire them.
11596,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11597,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ Pray, what is this bush with narrow whitish leaves and blue"
11598,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",flowers?
11599,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11600,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Jac._ Don’t you know? It is rosemary.
11601,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11602,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ Is it good for anything?
11603,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11604,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ We like the smell of it; and then the leaves, mixed with a little"
11605,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","balm, make pleasant tea, which we sometimes drink in the afternoon."
11606,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11607,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ Here are several more plants that I never saw before.
11608,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11609,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ Some of them are pot-herbs, that we put into our broth or"
11610,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","porridge; and others are physic herbs, for we cannot afford to go to a"
11611,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",doctor for every trifling ailment.
11612,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11613,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ But how do you learn the use of these things?
11614,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11615,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ Why, partly, master, from an old herbal that I have got; and"
11616,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",partly from my good mother and some old neighbours; for we poor people
11617,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",are obliged to help one another as well as we can. If you were curious
11618,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","about plants, I could go into the fields, and show you a great many that"
11619,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","we reckon very fine for several uses, though I suppose we don’t call"
11620,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",them by the proper names.
11621,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11622,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ You keep your garden very neat, friend, and seem to make the"
11623,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",most of every inch of ground.
11624,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11625,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ Why, sir, we have hands enough, and all of us like to be doing a"
11626,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",little in it when our in-doors work is over. I am in hopes soon to be
11627,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","allowed a bit of land from the waste for a potato-ground, which will be"
11628,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",a great help to us. I shall then be able to keep a pig.
11629,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11630,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ I suppose, notwithstanding your industry, you live rather"
11631,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",hardly sometimes?
11632,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11633,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ To be sure, sir, we are somewhat pinched in dear times and hard"
11634,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","weather; but, thank God, I have constant work, and my children begin to"
11635,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","be some help to us, so that we fare better than some of our neighbours."
11636,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","If I do but keep my health, I don’t fear but we shall make a shift to"
11637,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",live.
11638,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11639,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ Keep such a contented mind, my friend, and you will have few"
11640,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","to envy. Good morning to you, and if any sickness or accident should"
11641,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","befall you, remember you have a friend in your neighbour at the hall."
11642,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11643,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ I will, sir, and thank you."
11644,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11645,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ Good morning to you.
11646,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11647,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Jac._ The same to you, master."
11648,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11649,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",[_They leave the cottage._
11650,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11651,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ Well, Charles, what do you think of our visit?"
11652,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11653,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ I am highly pleased with it, sir. I shall have a better opinion of"
11654,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",a poor cottager as long as I live.
11655,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11656,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ I am glad of it. You see when we compare ourselves with this
11657,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","weaver, all the advantage is not on our side. He is possessed of an art,"
11658,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","the utility of which secures him a livelihood, whatever may be the"
11659,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","changes of the times. All his family are brought up to industry, and"
11660,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",show no small ingenuity in their several occupations. They are not
11661,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","without instruction, and especially seem to be in no want of that best"
11662,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","of all, the knowledge of their duty. They understand something of the"
11663,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","cultivation and uses of plants, and are capable of receiving enjoyment"
11664,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",from the beauties of nature. They partake of the pleasures of home and
11665,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","neighbourhood. Above all they seem content with their lot, and free from"
11666,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",anxious cares and repinings. I view them as truly respectable members of
11667,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","society, acting well the part allotted to them, and that, a part most of"
11668,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","all necessary to the well-being of the whole. They may, from untoward"
11669,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","accidents, be rendered objects of our compassion, but they never can of"
11670,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",our contempt.
11671,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11672,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ Indeed, sir, I am very far from despising them now. But would it"
11673,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",not be possible to make them more comfortable than they are at present?
11674,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11675,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ I think it would; and when giving a little from the
11676,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",superfluity of persons in our situation would add so much to the
11677,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","happiness of persons in theirs, I am of opinion that it is unpardonable"
11678,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",not to do it. I intend to use my interest to get this poor man the piece
11679,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","of waste land he wants, and he shall have some from my share rather than"
11680,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",go without.
11681,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11682,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Ch._ And suppose, sir, we were to give him some good potatoes to plant"
11683,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",it?
11684,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11685,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","_Mr. Ev._ We will. Then, you know, we have a fine sow, that never fails"
11686,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",to produce a numerous litter twice a year. Suppose we rear one of the
11687,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",next brood to be ready for him as soon as he has got his potato-ground
11688,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",into bearing?
11689,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11690,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Ch._ O yes! that will be just the thing. But how is he to build a
11691,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",pigsty?
11692,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",
11693,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",_Mr. Ev._ You may leave that to his own ingenuity! I warrant he can
11694,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","manage such a job as that with the help of a neighbour, at least. Well—I"
11695,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","hope both the weaver, and you, will be the better for the acquaintance"
11696,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","we have made to-day; and always remember, that _man, when fulfilling the"
11697,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.","duties of his station, be that station what it may, is a worthy object"
11698,"HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.",of respect to his fellow-men_.

11709,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11710,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11711,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"The populous kingdom of Ava, in India beyond the Ganges, was once"
11712,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"inherited by a minor prince, who was brought up in the luxurious"
11713,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,indolence of an eastern palace. When he had reached the age of
11714,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"seventeen, which by the laws of that country, was the period of majority"
11715,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"for the crown, all the great men of his court, and the governors of the"
11716,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"provinces, according to established custom, laid at his feet presents"
11717,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,consisting of the most costly products of nature and art that they had
11718,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,been able to procure. One offered a casket of the most precious jewels
11719,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,of Golconda; another a curious piece of clockwork made by a European
11720,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"artist; another, a piece of the richest silk from the looms of China;"
11721,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"another, a bezoar stone said to be a sovereign antidote against all"
11722,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"poisons and infectious diseases; another, a choice piece of the most"
11723,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"fragrant rose-wood, in a box of ebony inlaid with pearls; another, a"
11724,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"golden cruse full of genuine balsam of Mecca; another, a courser of the"
11725,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"purest breed of Arabia; and another, a female slave of exquisite beauty."
11726,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,The whole court of the palace was overspread with rarities; and long
11727,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,rows of slaves were continually passing loaded with vessels and utensils
11728,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"of gold and silver, and other articles of high price."
11729,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11730,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"At length, an aged magistrate from a distant province made his"
11731,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"appearance. He was simply clad in a long cotton robe, and his hoary"
11732,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,beard waved on his breast. He made his obeisance before the young
11733,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"monarch, and holding forth an embroidered silken bag, he thus addressed"
11734,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,him:—
11735,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11736,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"“Deign, great king, to accept the faithful homage and fervent good"
11737,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"wishes of thy servant on this important day, and with them the small"
11738,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"present I hold in my hand. Small, indeed, it is in show, but not so, I"
11739,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"trust, in value. Others have offered what may decorate thy person—here"
11740,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,is what will impart perpetual grace and lustre to thy features. Others
11741,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,have presented thee with rich perfumes—here is what will make thy name
11742,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,sweet and fragrant to the latest ages. Others have given what may afford
11743,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,pleasure to thine eyes—here is what will nourish a source of
11744,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,never-failing pleasure within thy breast. Others have furnished thee
11745,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,with preservatives against bodily contagion—here is what will preserve
11746,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,thy better parts uncontaminated. Others have heaped round thee the
11747,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,riches of a temporal kingdom—this will secure thee the treasures of an
11748,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,eternal one.”
11749,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11750,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"He said, and drew from the purse a book, containing _the moral precepts"
11751,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"of the sage Zendar_, the wisest and most virtuous man the East had ever"
11752,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"beheld. “If,” he proceeded, “my gracious sovereign will condescend to"
11753,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"make this his constant companion, not an hour can pass in which its"
11754,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,perusal may not be a comfort and a blessing. In the arduous duties of
11755,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,thy station it will prove a faithful guide and counsellor. Amid the
11756,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"allurements of pleasure and the incitements of passion, it will be an"
11757,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"incorruptible monitor, that will never suffer thee to err without"
11758,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"warning thee of thy error. It will render thee a blessing to thy people,"
11759,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,and blessed in thyself: for what sovereign can be the one without the
11760,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,other?”
11761,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,
11762,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"He then returned the book to its place, and kneeling, gave it into the"
11763,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,"hands of the king. He received it with respect and benignity, and"
11764,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,history affirms that the use he made of it corresponded with the wishes
11765,THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.,of the donor.

11772,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tutor_—_George_—_Harry_.
11773,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11774,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11775,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Harry._ I wonder what all this heap of stones is for?
11776,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11777,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_George._ I can tell you—it is for the lime-kiln; do n’t you see it just
11778,ON EARTHS AND STONES,by?
11779,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11780,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ O yes, I do. But what is to be done to them there?"
11781,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11782,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Why, they are to be burnt into lime; do n’t you know that?"
11783,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11784,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ But what is lime, and what are its uses?"
11785,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11786,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I can tell you one; they lay it on the fields for manure. Do n’t
11787,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"you remember we saw a number of little heaps of it, that we took for"
11788,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"sheep at a distance, and wondered they did not move? However, I believe"
11789,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"we had better ask our tutor about it. Will you please, sir, to tell us"
11790,ON EARTHS AND STONES,something about lime?
11791,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11792,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tutor._ Willingly. But suppose, as we talked about all sorts of metals"
11793,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"some time ago, I should now give you a lecture about stones and earths"
11794,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of all kinds, which are equally valuable, and much more common than"
11795,ON EARTHS AND STONES,metals.
11796,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11797,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Pray, do, sir."
11798,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11799,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ I shall be very glad to hear it.
11800,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11801,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Well, then. In the first place, the ground we tread upon, to as"
11802,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"great a depth as it has been dug, consists for the most part of matter"
11803,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of various appearance and hardness, called by the general name of"
11804,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_earths_. In common language, indeed, only the soft and powdery"
11805,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"substances are so named, while the hard and solid are called _stone_ or"
11806,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_rock_; but chymists use the same term for all; as, in fact, earth is"
11807,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"only crumbled stone, and stone only consolidated earth."
11808,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11809,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ What!—has the mould of my garden ever been stone?
11810,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11811,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ The black earth or mould which covers the surface wherever plants
11812,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"grow, consists mostly of parts of rotted vegetables, such as stalks,"
11813,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"leaves, and roots, mixed with sand or loose clay; but this only reaches"
11814,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"a little way; and beneath it you always come to a bed of gravel, or"
11815,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"clay, or stone of some kind. Now these earths and stones are"
11816,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"distinguished into several species, but principally into three, the"
11817,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"properties of which make them useful to man for very different purposes,"
11818,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and are, therefore, very well worth knowing. As you began with asking me"
11819,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"about lime, I shall first mention that class of earths from which it is"
11820,ON EARTHS AND STONES,obtained. These have derived their name of _calcareous_ from this very
11821,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"circumstance, _calx_ being lime, in Latin; and lime is got from them all"
11822,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"in the same way, by burning them in a strong fire. There are many kinds"
11823,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of calcareous earths. One of them is _marble_; you know what that is?
11824,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11825,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ O yes! Our parlour chimney-piece and hearth are marble.
11826,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11827,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ And so are the monuments in the church.
11828,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11829,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ True. There are various kinds of it: white, black, yellow, gray,"
11830,ON EARTHS AND STONES,mottled and veined with different colours; but all of them are hard and
11831,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"heavy stones, admitting a fine polish, on which account they are much"
11832,ON EARTHS AND STONES,used in ornamental works.
11833,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11834,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I think statues are made of it?
11835,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11836,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Yes; and where it is plentiful, columns, and porticoes, and"
11837,ON EARTHS AND STONES,sometimes whole buildings. Marble is the luxury of architecture.
11838,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11839,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Where does marble come from?
11840,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11841,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ From a great many countries. Great Britain produces some, but"
11842,ON EARTHS AND STONES,mostly of inferior kinds. What we use chiefly comes from Italy. The
11843,ON EARTHS AND STONES,Greek islands yield some fine sorts. That of Paros is of ancient fame
11844,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"for whiteness and purity, and the finest antique statues have been made"
11845,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of Parian marble.
11846,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11847,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ I suppose black marble will not burn into white lime?
11848,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11849,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Yes, it will. A violent heat will expel most of the colouring"
11850,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"matter of marbles, and make them white. _Chalk_ is another kind of"
11851,ON EARTHS AND STONES,calcareous earth. This is of a much softer consistence than marble;
11852,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"being easily cut with a knife, and marking things on which it is rubbed."
11853,ON EARTHS AND STONES,It is found in great beds in the earth; and in some parts of England
11854,ON EARTHS AND STONES,whole hills are composed of it.
11855,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11856,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ Are chalk and whiting the same?
11857,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11858,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Whiting is made of the finer and purer particles of chalk washed
11859,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"out from the rest, and then dried in lumps. This you know is quite soft"
11860,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and crumbly. There are, besides, a great variety of stones in the earth"
11861,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"harder than chalk, but softer than marble, which will burn to lime, and"
11862,ON EARTHS AND STONES,are therefore called _lime-stones_. These differ much in colour and
11863,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"other properties, and accordingly furnish lime of different qualities."
11864,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"Whole ridges of mountains in various parts are composed of lime-stone,"
11865,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and it is found plentifully in most of the hilly counties of England, to"
11866,ON EARTHS AND STONES,the great advantage of the inhabitants.
11867,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11868,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ Will not oyster-shells burn into lime? I think I have heard of
11869,ON EARTHS AND STONES,oyster-shell lime.
11870,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11871,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ They will, and this is another source of calcareous earth. The"
11872,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"shells of all animals, both land and sea, as oysters, mussels, cockles,"
11873,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"crabs, lobsters, snails, and the like, and also egg-shells of all kinds,"
11874,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"consist of this earth; and so does coral, which is formed by insects"
11875,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"under the sea, and is very abundant in some countries. Vast quantities"
11876,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of shells are often found deep in the earth, in the midst of chalk and"
11877,ON EARTHS AND STONES,lime-stone beds; whence some have supposed that all calcareous earth is
11878,ON EARTHS AND STONES,originally an animal production.
11879,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11880,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ But where could animals enough ever have lived to make mountains
11881,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of their shells?
11882,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11883,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ That, indeed, I cannot answer. But there are sufficient proofs"
11884,ON EARTHS AND STONES,that our world must long have existed in a very different state from the
11885,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"present. Well—but besides these purer calcareous earths, it is very"
11886,ON EARTHS AND STONES,frequently found mingled in different proportions with other earths.
11887,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"Thus _marl_, which is so much used in manuring land, and of which there"
11888,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"are a great many kinds, consists of calcareous earth, united with clay"
11889,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and sand; and the more of this earth it contains, the richer manure it"
11890,ON EARTHS AND STONES,generally makes.
11891,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11892,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ Is there any way of discovering it when it is mixed in this
11893,ON EARTHS AND STONES,manner with other things?
11894,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11895,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Yes—there is an easy and sure method of discovering the smallest
11896,ON EARTHS AND STONES,portion of it. All the varieties of calcareous earth that I have
11897,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"mentioned have the property of dissolving in acids, and effervescing"
11898,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"with them; that is, they bubble and hiss when acids are poured upon"
11899,ON EARTHS AND STONES,them. You may readily try this at any time with a piece of chalk or an
11900,ON EARTHS AND STONES,oyster-shell.
11901,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11902,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I will pour some vinegar upon an oyster-shell as soon as I get
11903,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"home. But now I think of it, I have often done so in eating oysters, and"
11904,ON EARTHS AND STONES,I never observed it to hiss or bubble.
11905,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11906,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Vinegar is not an acid strong enough to act upon a thing so solid
11907,ON EARTHS AND STONES,as a shell. But sulphuric and muriatic acids will do it at once; and
11908,ON EARTHS AND STONES,persons who examine the nature of fossils always travel with a bottle of
11909,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"one of these acids, by way of a test of calcareous earth. Your vinegar"
11910,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"will answer with chalk or whiting. This property of dissolving in acids,"
11911,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and what is called neutralizing them, or taking away their sourness, has"
11912,ON EARTHS AND STONES,caused many of the calcareous earths to be used in medicine. You know
11913,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"that sometimes our food turns very sour upon the stomach, and occasions"
11914,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"the pain called heart-burn, and other uneasy symptoms. In these cases it"
11915,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"is common to give chalk or powdered shells, or other things of this"
11916,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"kind, which afford relief, by neutralizing the acid."
11917,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11918,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ I suppose, then, _magnesia_ is something of this sort, for I have"
11919,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"often seen it given to my little sister, when they said her stomach was"
11920,ON EARTHS AND STONES,out of order?
11921,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11922,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ It is; but though magnesia has some properties in common with
11923,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"calcareous earths, it possesses others that are peculiar to itself."
11924,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11925,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Pray, what are the other uses of these earths?"
11926,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11927,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Such of them as are hard stone, as the marbles and many of the"
11928,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"lime-stones, are used for the same purposes as other stones. But their"
11929,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"great use is in the form of lime, which is a substance of many curious"
11930,ON EARTHS AND STONES,properties that I will now explain to you. When fresh burnt it is called
11931,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_quicklime_, on account of the heat and life, as it were, which it"
11932,ON EARTHS AND STONES,possesses. Have you ever seen a lump put into water?
11933,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11934,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Yes, I have."
11935,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11936,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Were you not much surprised to see it swell and crack to pieces,"
11937,ON EARTHS AND STONES,with a hissing noise and a great smoke and heat?
11938,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11939,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ I was, indeed. But what is the cause of this—how can cold water"
11940,ON EARTHS AND STONES,occasion so much heat?
11941,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11942,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ I will tell you. The strong heat to which calcareous earth is
11943,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"exposed in making it lime expels all the water it contained, (for all"
11944,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"earths, as well as almost everything else, naturally contain water,) and"
11945,ON EARTHS AND STONES,also a quantity of a peculiar kind of air which was united with it. If
11946,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"water be now added to this quicklime, it is drunk in again with such"
11947,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"rapidity, as to crack and break the lime to pieces. At the same time a"
11948,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"great heat is occasioned by the water combining with the lime, and this"
11949,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"makes itself sensible by its effects, burning all the things that it"
11950,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"touches, and turning part of the water to steam. This operation is"
11951,ON EARTHS AND STONES,called slacking of lime. The water in which lime is slacked dissolves a
11952,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"part of it, and acquires a very pungent harsh taste: this is used in"
11953,ON EARTHS AND STONES,medicine under the name of lime-water. If instead of soaking quicklime
11954,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"in water, it is exposed for sometime to the air, it attracts moisture"
11955,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"slowly, and by degrees fails to powder, without much heat or"
11956,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"disturbance. But whether lime be slacked in water or air, it does not at"
11957,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"first return to the state in which it was before, since it still remains"
11958,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"deprived of its air, and on that account is still pungent and caustic."
11959,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"At length, however, it recovers this also from the atmosphere, and is"
11960,ON EARTHS AND STONES,then mild calcareous earth as at first. Now it is upon some of these
11961,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"circumstances that the utility of lime depends. In the first place, its"
11962,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"burning and corroding quality makes it useful to the tanner, in"
11963,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"loosening all the hair from the hides, and destroying the flesh and fat"
11964,ON EARTHS AND STONES,that adhered to them. And so in various other trades it is used as a
11965,ON EARTHS AND STONES,great cleanser and purifier.
11966,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11967,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ I have a thought come into my head. When it is laid upon the
11968,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"ground, I suppose its use must be to burn up the weeds?"
11969,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11970,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ True—that is part of its use.
11971,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11972,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ But it must burn up the good grass and corn too?
11973,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11974,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Properly objected. But the case is, that the farmer does not sow"
11975,ON EARTHS AND STONES,his seeds till the lime is rendered mild by exposure to the air and
11976,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"weather, and is well mixed with the soil. And even then it is reckoned a"
11977,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"hot and forcing manure, chiefly fit for cold and wet lands. The"
11978,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"principal use of lime, however, is as an ingredient in _mortar_. This,"
11979,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"you know, is the cement by which bricks and stones are held together in"
11980,ON EARTHS AND STONES,building. It is made of fresh slacked lime and a proportion of sand well
11981,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"mixed together; and, when used for plastering walls, some chopped hair"
11982,ON EARTHS AND STONES,is put into it. The lime binds with the other ingredients; and in length
11983,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of time, the mortar, if well made, becomes as hard, or harder, than"
11984,ON EARTHS AND STONES,stone itself.
11985,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11986,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I have heard of the mortar in very old buildings being harder and
11987,ON EARTHS AND STONES,stronger than any made at present.
11988,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11989,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ That is only on account of its age. Burning lime and making
11990,ON EARTHS AND STONES,mortar are as well understood now as ever: but in order to have it
11991,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"excellent, the lime should be of a good quality, and thoroughly burnt."
11992,ON EARTHS AND STONES,Some sorts of lime have the property of making mortar which will harden
11993,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"under water, whence it is much valued for bridges, locks, wharfs, and"
11994,ON EARTHS AND STONES,the like.
11995,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
11996,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Pray, is not plaster of Paris a kind of lime? I know it will"
11997,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"become hard by only mixing water with it, for I have used it to make"
11998,ON EARTHS AND STONES,casts of.
11999,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12000,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ The powder you call plaster of Paris is made of an earth named
12001,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_gypsum_, of which there are several kinds. _Alabaster_ is a stone of"
12002,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"this sort, and hard enough to be used like marble. The gypseous earths"
12003,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"are of the calcareous kind, but they have naturally a portion of acid"
12004,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"united with them, whence they will not effervesce on having acid poured"
12005,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"on them. But they are distinguished by the property, that after being"
12006,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"calcined or burnt in the fire, and reduced to powder, they will set into"
12007,ON EARTHS AND STONES,a solid body by the addition of water alone. This makes them very useful
12008,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"for ornamental plasters, that are to receive a form or impression, such"
12009,ON EARTHS AND STONES,as the stucco for the ceiling of rooms.
12010,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12011,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"Well—we have said enough about calcareous earths; now to another class,"
12012,ON EARTHS AND STONES,the _argillaceous_.
12013,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12014,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I think I know what those are. _Argilla_ is _Latin_ for _clay_.
12015,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12016,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ True; and they are also called _clayey_ earths. In general, these"
12017,ON EARTHS AND STONES,earths are of a soft texture and a sort of greasy feel; but they are
12018,ON EARTHS AND STONES,peculiarly distinguished by the property of becoming sticky on being
12019,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"tempered with water, so that they may be drawn out and worked into form"
12020,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"like a paste. Have you ever, when you were a little boy, made a"
12021,ON EARTHS AND STONES,clay-house?
12022,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12023,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Yes, I have."
12024,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12025,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Then you well know the manner in which clay is tempered, and"
12026,ON EARTHS AND STONES,worked for this purpose?
12027,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12028,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Yes—and I remember helping to make little pots and mugs of clay.
12029,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12030,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Then you imitated the potter’s trade; for all utensils of
12031,ON EARTHS AND STONES,earthenware are made of clays either pure or mixed. This is one of the
12032,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"oldest arts among mankind, and one of the most useful. They furnish"
12033,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"materials for building, too; for bricks and tiles are made of these"
12034,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"earths. But in order to be fit for these purposes, it is necessary that"
12035,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"clay should not only be soft and ductile while it is forming, but"
12036,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"capable of being hardened afterward; and this it is, by the assistance"
12037,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of fire. Pottery-ware and bricks are burnt with a strong heat in kilns,"
12038,ON EARTHS AND STONES,by which they acquire a hardness equal to that of the hardest stone.
12039,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12040,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I think I have heard of bricks being baked by the sun’s heat
12041,ON EARTHS AND STONES,alone in very hot countries.
12042,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12043,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ True; and they may serve for building in climates where rain
12044,ON EARTHS AND STONES,scarcely ever falls; but heavy showers would wash them away. Fire seems
12045,ON EARTHS AND STONES,to change the nature of clays; for after they have undergone its
12046,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"operation, they become incapable of returning of themselves to a soft"
12047,ON EARTHS AND STONES,and ductile state. You might steep brick-dust or pounded pots in water
12048,ON EARTHS AND STONES,ever so long without making it hold together in the least.
12049,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12050,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I suppose there are many kinds of clays?
12051,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12052,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ There are. Argillaceous earths differ greatly from each other in
12053,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"colour, purity, and other qualities. Some are perfectly white, as that"
12054,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of which tobacco-pipes are made. Others are blue, brown, yellow, and in"
12055,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"short of all hues, which they owe to mixtures of decaying vegetable"
12056,ON EARTHS AND STONES,substances or metals. Those which burn red contain a portion of iron. No
12057,ON EARTHS AND STONES,clays are found perfectly pure; but they are mixed with more or less of
12058,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"other earths. The common brick-clays contain a large proportion of sand,"
12059,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"which often makes them crumbly and perishable. In general, the finest"
12060,ON EARTHS AND STONES,earthenware is made of the purest and whitest clays; but other matters
12061,ON EARTHS AND STONES,are mixed in order to harden and strengthen them. Thus _porcelain_ or
12062,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_china_ is made with a clayey earth mixed with a stone of vitrifiable
12063,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"nature, that is, which may be melted into glass; and the fine pottery"
12064,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"called _queen’s ware_ is a mixture of tobacco-pipe clay, and flints"
12065,ON EARTHS AND STONES,burnt and powdered. Common stone _ware_ is a coarse mixture of this
12066,ON EARTHS AND STONES,sort. Some species of pottery are made with mixtures of burnt and
12067,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"unburnt clay; the former I told you before, being incapable of becoming"
12068,ON EARTHS AND STONES,soft again with water like a natural clay.
12069,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12070,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Are clays of no other use than to make pottery of?
12071,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12072,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Yes, the richest soils are those which have a proportion of clay;"
12073,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and marl, which I have already mentioned as a manure, generally contains"
12074,ON EARTHS AND STONES,a good deal of it. Then clay has the property of absorbing oil or
12075,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"grease, whence some kinds of it are used like soap for cleaning clothes."
12076,ON EARTHS AND STONES,The substance called _fullers’ earth_ is a mixed earth of the
12077,ON EARTHS AND STONES,argillaceous kind; and its use in taking out the oil which naturally
12078,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"adheres to wool is so great, that it has been one cause of the"
12079,ON EARTHS AND STONES,superiority of our woollen cloths.
12080,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12081,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Then I suppose it is found in England?
12082,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12083,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Yes. There are pits of the best kind of it near Woburn in
12084,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"Bedfordshire, and Nutfield in Surrey, England. The different kinds of"
12085,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"slate, too, are stones of the argillaceous class; and very useful ones,"
12086,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"for covering houses, and other purposes."
12087,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12088,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Are writing slates like the slates used for covering houses?
12089,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12090,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Yes; but their superior blackness and smoothness make them show
12091,ON EARTHS AND STONES,better the marks of the pencil.
12092,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12093,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ You have mentioned something of sand and flints, but you have not"
12094,ON EARTHS AND STONES,told us what sort of earths they are.
12095,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12096,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ I reserved that till I spoke of the third great class of earths.
12097,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"This is the _siliceous_ class, so named from _silex_, which is Latin for"
12098,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"a flint-stone. They have also been called _vitrifiable_ earths, because"
12099,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"they are the principal ingredient in glass, named in Latin _vitrum_."
12100,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12101,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I have heard of flint-glass.
12102,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12103,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Yes—but neither flint, nor any other of the kind, will make"
12104,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"glass, even by the strongest heat, without some addition; but this we"
12105,ON EARTHS AND STONES,will speak of by-and-by. I shall now tell you the principal properties
12106,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of these earths. They are all very hard, and will strike fire with"
12107,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"steel, when in a mass large enough for the stroke. They mostly run into"
12108,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"particular shapes, with sharp angles and points, and have a certain"
12109,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"degree of transparency, which has made them also be called _crystalline_"
12110,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"earths. They do not in the least soften with water, like clays; nor are"
12111,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"they affected by acids, nor do they burn to lime, like the calcareous"
12112,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"earths. As to the different kinds of them, _flint_ has already been"
12113,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"mentioned. It is a very common production in some parts, and is"
12114,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"generally met with in pebbles, or round lumps forming pebbles, in"
12115,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"gravel-beds, and often almost entirely covering the surface of ploughed"
12116,ON EARTHS AND STONES,fields.
12117,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12118,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ But do they not hinder the corn from growing?
12119,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12120,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ The corn, to be sure, cannot take root upon them, but I believe"
12121,ON EARTHS AND STONES,it has been found that the protection they afford to the young plants
12122,ON EARTHS AND STONES,which grow under them is more than equal to the harm they do by taking
12123,ON EARTHS AND STONES,up room. Flints are also frequently found imbedded in chalk under the
12124,ON EARTHS AND STONES,ground. Those used in the Staffordshire potteries chiefly come from the
12125,ON EARTHS AND STONES,chalk-pits near Gravesend. So much for flints. You have seen white
12126,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"pebbles, which are semi-transparent, and when broken resemble white"
12127,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"sugar-candy. They are common on the seashore, and beds of rivers."
12128,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12129,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ O, yes. We call them fire-stones. When they are rubbed together"
12130,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"in the dark they send out great flashes of light, and have a particular"
12131,ON EARTHS AND STONES,smell.
12132,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12133,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ True. The proper name of these is _quartz_. It is found in large
12134,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"quantities in the earth, and the ores of metals are often imbedded in"
12135,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"it. Sometimes it is perfectly transparent, and then it is called"
12136,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_crystal_. Some of these crystals shoot into exact mathematical figures;
12137,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and because many salts do the same, and are also transparent, they are"
12138,ON EARTHS AND STONES,called the _crystals_ of such or such a salt.
12139,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12140,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Is not fine glass called crystal, too?"
12141,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12142,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ It is called so by way of simile; thus we say of a thing, “It is"
12143,ON EARTHS AND STONES,as clear as a crystal.” But the only true crystal is an earth of the
12144,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"kind I have been describing. Well, now we come to _sand_; for this is"
12145,ON EARTHS AND STONES,properly only quartz in a powdery state. If you examine the grains of
12146,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"sand singly, or look at them with a magnifying glass, you will find them"
12147,ON EARTHS AND STONES,all either entirely or partly transparent; and in some of the white
12148,ON EARTHS AND STONES,shining sands the grains are all little bright crystals.
12149,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12150,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ But most sand is broken or yellowish.
12151,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12152,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ That is owing to some mixture generally of the metallic kind. I
12153,ON EARTHS AND STONES,believe I once told you that all sands were supposed to contain a small
12154,ON EARTHS AND STONES,portion of gold. It is more certain that many of them contain iron.
12155,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12156,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ But what could have brought this quartz and crystal into powder,"
12157,ON EARTHS AND STONES,so as to have produced all the sand in the world?
12158,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12159,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ That is not very easy to determine. On the seashore, however, the"
12160,ON EARTHS AND STONES,incessant rolling of the pebbles by the waves is enough in time to grind
12161,ON EARTHS AND STONES,them to powder; and there is reason to believe that the greatest part of
12162,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"what is now dry land was once sea, which may account for the vast beds"
12163,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of sand met with inland.
12164,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12165,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I have seen some stone so soft that one might crumble it between
12166,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"one’s fingers, and then it seemed to turn to sand."
12167,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12168,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ There are several of this kind, more or less solid, which are"
12169,ON EARTHS AND STONES,chiefly composed of sand conglutinated by some natural cement. Such are
12170,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"called _sandstone_, or _freestone_, and are used for various purposes,"
12171,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"in building, making grindstones, and the like, according to their"
12172,ON EARTHS AND STONES,hardness.
12173,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12174,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ Pray, what are the common pebbles that the streets are paved"
12175,ON EARTHS AND STONES,with? I am sure they strike fire enough with horses’ shoes.
12176,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12177,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ They are stones of the siliceous kind, either pure or mixed with"
12178,ON EARTHS AND STONES,other earths. One of the hardest and best for this purpose is called
12179,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_granite_, which is of various kinds and colours, but always consists of"
12180,ON EARTHS AND STONES,grains of different siliceous stones cemented together. The streets of
12181,ON EARTHS AND STONES,London are paved with granite brought from Scotland. In some other
12182,ON EARTHS AND STONES,stones these bits of different earths dispersed through the cement are
12183,ON EARTHS AND STONES,so large as to look like plums in a pudding; whence they have obtained
12184,ON EARTHS AND STONES,the name of _pudding-stones_.
12185,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12186,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I think there is a kind of stones that you have not yet
12187,ON EARTHS AND STONES,mentioned—precious stones.
12188,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12189,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ These, too, are mostly siliceous; but some even of the hardest"
12190,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"and most valuable are argillaceous in their nature, though possessing"
12191,ON EARTHS AND STONES,none of the external properties of clay. The opaque and half-transparent
12192,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"precious stones, such as jasper, agate, cornelian, and lapis lazuli, are"
12193,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"engraved upon for seal-stones; the more beautiful and transparent ones,"
12194,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"as ruby, emerald, sapphire, topaz, which go by the name of gems, are"
12195,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"generally only cut and polished, and worn in rings, ear-rings,"
12196,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"necklaces, and the like."
12197,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12198,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Geo._ Diamond, no doubt, is one of them."
12199,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12200,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ So it has commonly been reckoned, and the purest of all; but late"
12201,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"experiments have shown, that though it is the hardest body in nature it"
12202,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"may be totally dispersed into vapour by a strong fire, so that"
12203,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"mineralogists will now hardly allow it to be a stone at all, but class"
12204,ON EARTHS AND STONES,it among inflammable substances. The precious stones abovementioned owe
12205,ON EARTHS AND STONES,their colours chiefly to some metallic mixture. They are in general
12206,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"extremely hard, so as to cut glass, and one another; but diamonds will"
12207,ON EARTHS AND STONES,cut all the rest.
12208,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12209,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ But are they not exceedingly rare?
12210,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12211,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ Yes; and in this rarity consists the greatest part of their
12212,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"value. They are, indeed, beautiful objects; but the figure they make in"
12213,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"proportion to their expense is so very small, that their high price may"
12214,ON EARTHS AND STONES,be reckoned one of the principal follies among mankind. What proportion
12215,ON EARTHS AND STONES,can there possibly be between the real worth of a glittering stone as
12216,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"big as a hazelnut, and a magnificent house and gardens, or a large tract"
12217,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of country covered with noble woods and rich meadows and cornfields? And
12218,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"as to the mere glitter, a large lustre of cut glass has an infinitely"
12219,ON EARTHS AND STONES,greater effect on the eye than all the jewels of a foreign prince.
12220,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12221,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ Will you please to tell us how glass is made?
12222,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12223,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Willingly. The base of it is, as I said before, some earth of the"
12224,ON EARTHS AND STONES,siliceous class. Those commonly used are flint and sand. Flint is first
12225,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"burnt or calcined, which makes it quite white, like enamel; and it is"
12226,ON EARTHS AND STONES,then powdered. This is the material sometimes used for some very white
12227,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"glasses; but sand is that commonly preferred, as being already in a"
12228,ON EARTHS AND STONES,powdery form. The white crystalline sands are used for fine glass; the
12229,ON EARTHS AND STONES,brown or yellow for the common sort. As these earths will not melt of
12230,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"themselves, the addition in making glass is somewhat that promotes their"
12231,ON EARTHS AND STONES,fusion. Various things will do this; but what is generally used is an
12232,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"alkaline salt, obtained from the ashes of burnt vegetables. Of this"
12233,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"there are several kinds, as potash, pearlash, barilla, and kelp. The"
12234,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"salt is mixed with the sand in a certain proportion, and the mixture"
12235,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"then exposed in earthen pots to a violent heat, till it is thoroughly"
12236,ON EARTHS AND STONES,melted. The mass is then cooled till it is nearly of the consistence of
12237,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"dough, and in this state it is fashioned by blowing and the use of"
12238,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"shears and other instruments. You must see this done some time, for it"
12239,ON EARTHS AND STONES,is one of the most curious and pleasing of all manufactures; and it is
12240,ON EARTHS AND STONES,not possible to form an idea of the ease and dexterity with which glass
12241,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"is wrought, without an actual view."
12242,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12243,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Har._ I should like very much to see it, indeed."
12244,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12245,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ Where is glass made in this country?
12246,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12247,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ In many places. Some of the finest in London, but the coarser"
12248,ON EARTHS AND STONES,kinds generally where coals are cheap; as at Newcastle and its
12249,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"neighbourhood, in Lancashire, at Stourbridge, Bristol, and in South"
12250,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"Wales. I should have told you, however, that in our finest and most"
12251,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"brilliant glass, a quantity of the oxide of lead is put, which vitrifies"
12252,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"with the other ingredients, and gives the glass more firmness and"
12253,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"density. The blue, yellow, and red glasses are coloured with the oxides"
12254,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of other metals. As to the common green glass, it is made with an alkali"
12255,ON EARTHS AND STONES,that has a good deal of calcareous earth remaining with the ashes of the
12256,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"plant. But to understand all the different circumstances of glassmaking,"
12257,ON EARTHS AND STONES,one must have a thorough knowledge of chymistry.
12258,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12259,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ I think making of glass is one of the finest inventions of human
12260,ON EARTHS AND STONES,skill.
12261,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12262,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Tut._ It is perhaps not of that capital importance that some other arts
12263,ON EARTHS AND STONES,possess; but it has been a great addition to the comfort and pleasure of
12264,ON EARTHS AND STONES,life in many ways. Nothing makes such clean and agreeable vessels as
12265,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"glass, which has the quality of not being corroded by any kind of"
12266,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"liquor, as well as that of showing its contents by its transparency."
12267,ON EARTHS AND STONES,Hence it is greatly preferable to the most precious metals for drinking
12268,ON EARTHS AND STONES,out of; and for the same reasons it is preferred to every other material
12269,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"for chymical utensils, where the heat to be employed is not strong"
12270,ON EARTHS AND STONES,enough to melt it.
12271,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12272,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ Then glass windows.
12273,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12274,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ Ay; that is a very material comfort in a climate like ours, where"
12275,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"we so often wish to let in the light, and keep out the cold wind and"
12276,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"rain. What could be more gloomy than to sit in the dark, or with no"
12277,ON EARTHS AND STONES,other light than came in through small holes covered with oiled paper or
12278,ON EARTHS AND STONES,bladder unable to see anything passing without doors! Yet this must have
12279,ON EARTHS AND STONES,been the case with the most sumptuous palaces before the invention of
12280,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"window-glass, which was a good deal later than that of bottles and"
12281,ON EARTHS AND STONES,drinking-glasses.
12282,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12283,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Har._ I think looking-glasses are very beautiful.
12284,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12285,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ They are, indeed, very elegant pieces of furniture, and very"
12286,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"costly too. The art of casting glass into large plates, big enough to"
12287,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"reach almost from the bottom to the top of a room, is but lately"
12288,ON EARTHS AND STONES,introduced into this country from France. But the most splendid and
12289,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"brilliant manner of employing glass is in lustres and chandeliers, hung"
12290,ON EARTHS AND STONES,around with drops cut so as to reflect the light with all the colours of
12291,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"the rainbow. Some of the shops in London, filled with these articles,"
12292,ON EARTHS AND STONES,appear to realize all the wonders of an enchanted palace in the Arabian
12293,ON EARTHS AND STONES,Nights’ Entertainments
12294,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12295,ON EARTHS AND STONES,_Geo._ But are not spectacles and spying-glasses more useful than all
12296,ON EARTHS AND STONES,these?
12297,ON EARTHS AND STONES,
12298,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"_Tut._ I did not mean to pass them over, I assure you. By the curious"
12299,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"invention of optical glasses of various kinds, not only the natural"
12300,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"defects of the sight have been remedied, and old age has been in some"
12301,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"measure lightened of one of its calamities, but the sense of seeing has"
12302,ON EARTHS AND STONES,been wonderfully extended. The telescope has brought distant objects
12303,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"within our view, while the microscope has given us a clear survey of"
12304,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"near objects too minute for our unassisted eyes. By means of both, some"
12305,ON EARTHS AND STONES,of the brightest discoveries of the modern times have been made; so that
12306,ON EARTHS AND STONES,glass has proved not less admirable in promoting science than in
12307,ON EARTHS AND STONES,contributing to splendour and convenience. Well—I don’t know that I have
12308,ON EARTHS AND STONES,anything more at present to say relative to the class of earths. We have
12309,ON EARTHS AND STONES,gone through the principal circumstances belonging to their three great
12310,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"divisions, the _calcareous_, _argillaceous_, and _siliceous_. You will"
12311,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"remember, however, that most of the earths and stones offered by nature"
12312,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"are not in any one of these kinds perfectly pure, but contain a mixture"
12313,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"of one or both the others. There is not a pebble that you can pick up,"
12314,ON EARTHS AND STONES,which would not exercise the skill of a mineralogist fully to ascertain
12315,ON EARTHS AND STONES,"its properties, and the materials of its composition. So inexhaustible"
12316,ON EARTHS AND STONES,is nature!

12406,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12407,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tutor_—_George_—_Harry._
12408,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12409,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12410,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_George._ How rich yon field looks with its yellow flowers! I wonder
12411,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,what they can be?
12412,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12413,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tutor._ Suppose you go and see if you can find it out; and bring a
12414,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,stalk of the flowers with you.
12415,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12416,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ (_Returning_). I know now—they are turnips.
12417,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12418,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ I thought you could make it out when you came near them. These
12419,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"turnips are left to seed, which is the reason why you see them run to"
12420,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,flower. Commonly they are pulled up sooner.
12421,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12422,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Harry._ I should not have thought a turnip had so sweet a flower.
12423,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12424,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I think I have smelt others like them. Pray, sir, what class of"
12425,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,plants do they belong to?
12426,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12427,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ To a very numerous one, with which it is worth your while to get"
12428,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"acquainted. Let us sit down and examine them. The petal, you observe,"
12429,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"consists of four flat leaves set opposite to each other, or crosswise."
12430,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,From this circumstance the flowers have been called _cruciform_. As most
12431,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"plants with flowers of this kind bear their seeds in pods, they have"
12432,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"likewise been called the _siliquose_ plants, _siliqua_ being the Latin"
12433,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,for a pod.
12434,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12435,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ But the papilionaceous flowers bear pods, too."
12436,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12437,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ True; and therefore the name is not a good one. Now pull off the
12438,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,petals one by one. You see they are fastened by long claws within the
12439,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,flower cup. Now count the chives.
12440,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12441,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ There are six.
12442,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12443,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ But they are not all of the same length—two are much shorter than
12444,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,the rest.
12445,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12446,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ Well observed. It is from this that Linnæus has formed a
12447,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"particular class for the whole tribe, which he calls _tetradynamia_, a"
12448,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"word implying _four powers_, or the _power of four_, as if the four"
12449,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,longer chives were more perfect and efficacious than the two shorter;
12450,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"which, however, we do not know to be the case. This superior length of"
12451,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"four chives is conspicuous in most plants of this tribe, but not in all."
12452,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"They have, however, other resemblances which are sufficient to"
12453,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,constitute them a natural family; and accordingly all botanists have
12454,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,made them such.
12455,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12456,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"The flowers, as I have said, have in all of them four petals placed"
12457,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,crosswise. The calyx also consists of four oblong and hollow leaves.
12458,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"There is a single pistil, standing upon a seed-bud, which, turns either"
12459,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"into a long pod, or a short round one called a pouch; and hence are"
12460,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"formed the two great branches of the family, the podded and the pouched."
12461,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"The seed-vessel has two valves, or external openings, with a partition"
12462,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"between. The seeds are small and roundish, attached alternately to both"
12463,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,sutures or joinings of the valves. Do you observe all these
12464,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,circumstances?
12465,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12466,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo. and Har._ We do.
12467,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12468,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ You shall examine them more minutely in a larger plant of the
12469,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"kind. Further, almost all these plants have somewhat of a biting taste,"
12470,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"and also a disagreeable smell in their leaves, especially when decayed."
12471,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"A turnip-field, you know, smells but indifferently; and cabbage, which"
12472,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"is one of this class, is apt to be remarkably offensive."
12473,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12474,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Har._ Yes, there is nothing worse than rotten cabbage-leaves."
12475,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12476,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ And the very water in which they are boiled is enough to scent a
12477,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,whole house.
12478,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12479,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ The flowers, however, of almost all the family are fragrant, and"
12480,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"some remarkably so. What do you think of wall-flowers, and stocks?"
12481,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12482,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Har._ What, are they of this kind?"
12483,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12484,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes—and so is candy-tuft, and rocket."
12485,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12486,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Then they are not to be despised.
12487,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12488,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ No—and especially as not one of the whole class, I believe, is"
12489,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"poisonous; but, on the contrary, many of them afford good food for man"
12490,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,and beast. Shall I tell you about the principal of them?
12491,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12492,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ Pray do, sir."
12493,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12494,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ The pungency of taste which so many of them possess has caused
12495,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"them to be used for salad herbs. Thus we have cress, water-cress, and"
12496,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"mustard; to which might be added many more which grow wild, as"
12497,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"lady-smock, wild-rocket, hedge-mustard, and jack-by-the-hedge, or"
12498,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"sauce-alone. Mustard, you know, is also greatly used for its seeds, the"
12499,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"powder or flower of which, made into a sort of paste with salt and"
12500,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"water, is eaten with many kinds of meat. Rape-seeds are very similar to"
12501,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"them, and from both an oil is pressed out, of the mild or tasteless"
12502,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"kind, as it is likewise from cole-seed, another product of this class."
12503,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"Scurvy-grass, which is a pungent plant of this family, growing by the"
12504,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"seaside, has obtained its name from being a remedy for the scurvy. Then"
12505,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"there is horseradish, with the root of which I am sure you are well"
12506,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"acquainted, as a companion to roast beef. Common radish, too, is a plant"
12507,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"of this kind, which has a good deal of pungency. One sort of it has a"
12508,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"root like a turnip, which brings it near in quality to the turnip"
12509,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"itself. This last plant, though affording a sweet and mild nutriment,"
12510,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,has naturally a degree of pungency and rankness.
12511,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12512,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ That, I suppose, is the reason why turnipy milk and butter have"
12513,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,such a strong taste?
12514,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12515,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ It is.
12516,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12517,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Then why do they feed cows with it?
12518,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12519,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ In this case as in many others, quality is sacrificed to"
12520,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,quantity. But the better use of the turnip to the farmer is to fatten
12521,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,sheep and cattle. By its assistance he is enabled to keep many more of
12522,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,these animals than he could find grass or hay for; and the culture of
12523,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"turnips prepares his land for grain as well, or better, than could be"
12524,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"done by letting it lie quite fallow. Turnip husbandry, as it is called,"
12525,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,is one of the capital modern improvements of agriculture.
12526,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12527,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ I think I have heard that Norfolk is famous for it.
12528,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12529,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ It is so. That county abounds in light sandy lands, which are"
12530,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,peculiarly suitable to turnips. But they are now grown in many parts of
12531,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"England besides. Well—but we must say something more about cabbage, an"
12532,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,article of food of very long standing. The original species of this is a
12533,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"seaside plant, but cultivation has produced a great number of varieties"
12534,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"well known in our gardens, as white and red cabbage, kale, colewort,"
12535,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"brocoli, borecole, and cauliflower."
12536,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12537,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ But the flower of cauliflower does not seem at all like that of
12538,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,cabbage or turnip.
12539,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12540,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ The white head, called its flower, is not properly so, but"
12541,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,consists of a cluster of imperfect buds. If they are left to grow for
12542,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"seed, they throw out some spikes of yellow flowers like common cabbage."
12543,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,Brocoli heads are of the same kind. As to the head of white or red
12544,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"cabbage, it consists of a vast number of leaves closing round each"
12545,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"other, by which the innermost are prevented from expanding, and remain"
12546,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"white on account of the exclusion of the light and air. This part, you"
12547,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"know, is most valued for food. In some countries they cut cabbage-heads"
12548,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"into quarters, and make them undergo a kind of acid fermentation; after"
12549,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"which they are salted and preserved for winter food, under the name of"
12550,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,sour-krout.
12551,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12552,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ Cattle, too, are sometimes fed with cabbage, I believe."
12553,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12554,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ Yes, and large fields of them are cultivated for that purpose."
12555,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"They succeed best in stiff clayey soils, where they sometimes grow to an"
12556,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,enormous bigness. They are given to milch kine as well as to fattening
12557,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,cattle.
12558,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12559,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ Do not they give a bad taste to the milk?
12560,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12561,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ They are apt to do so unless great care is taken to pick off all
12562,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,the decayed leaves.
12563,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12564,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"Coleworts, which are a smaller sort of cabbage, are sometimes grown for"
12565,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,feeding sheep and cattle. I think I have now mentioned most of the
12566,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"useful plants of this family, which you see are numerous and important."
12567,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"They both yield beef and mutton, and the sauce to them. But many of the"
12568,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,species are troublesome weeds. You see how yonder corn is overrun with
12569,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,yellow flowers.
12570,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12571,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Geo._ Yes: they are as thick as if they had been sown.
12572,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12573,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ They are of this family, and called charlock, or wild mustard, or"
12574,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"corn kale, which, indeed, are not all exactly the same things, though"
12575,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"nearly resembling. These produce such plenty of seeds, that it is very"
12576,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"difficult to clear a field of them, if once they are suffered to grow"
12577,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,till the seeds ripen. An extremely common weed in gardens and by
12578,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"roadsides is shepherd’s-purse, which is a very good specimen of the"
12579,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"pouch-bearing plants of this tribe, its seed-vessels being exactly the"
12580,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,figure of a heart. Lady-smock is often so abundant a weed in wet meadows
12581,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,as to make them all over white with their flowers. Some call this plant
12582,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"cuckoo-flower, because its flowering is about the same time with the"
12583,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,first appearance of that bird in spring.
12584,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12585,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Geo._ I remember some pretty lines in a song about spring, in which"
12586,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,lady-smock is mentioned:—
12587,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12588,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"“When daisies pied, and violets blue,"
12589,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"And lady-smocks all silver white,"
12590,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,"
12591,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,Do paint the meadows with delight.”
12592,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12593,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ They are Shakspeare’s. You see he gives the name of cuckoo-bud to
12594,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"some other flower, a yellow one, which appears at the same season. But"
12595,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"still earlier than this time, walls and hedge-banks are enlivened by a"
12596,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"very small white flower, called whitlow-grass, which is one of the"
12597,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,tribe.
12598,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12599,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Har._ Is it easy to distinguish the plants of this family from one
12600,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,another?
12601,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12602,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,_Tut._ Not very easy; for the general similarity of the flowers is so
12603,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"great, that little distinction can be drawn from them. The marks of the"
12604,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,species are chiefly taken from the form and manner of growth of the
12605,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"seed-vessel, and we will examine some of them by the descriptions in a"
12606,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"book of botany. There is one very remarkable seed-vessel, which probably"
12607,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,you have observed in the garden. It is a perfectly round large flat
12608,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"pouch, which after it has shed its seed, remains on the stalk and looks"
12609,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,likes a thin white bladder. The plant bearing it is commonly called
12610,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,honesty.
12611,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12612,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Har._ O, I know it very well! It is put into winter flower-pots."
12613,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,
12614,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"_Tut._ True. So much, then, for the tetradynamous or cruciform-flowered"
12615,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"plants. You cannot well mistake them for any other class, if you remark"
12616,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"the six chives, four of them, generally, but not always, longer than the"
12617,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,two others; the single pistil changing either into a long pod or a round
12618,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,"pouch containing the seeds; the four opposite petals of the flower, and"
12619,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,four leaves of the calyx. You may safely make a salad of the young
12620,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,leaves wherever you find them: the worst they can do to you is to bite
12621,THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.,your tongue.

12632,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12633,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harford._ There is the place! This is the green on which I played many
12634,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,a day with my companions; there are the tall trees that I have so often
12635,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,climbed for birds’-nests; and that is the pond where I used to sail my
12636,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,walnut-shell boats. What a crowd of mixed sensations rush on my mind!
12637,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"What pleasures, and what regret! Yes, there is somewhat in our native"
12638,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,soil that affects the mind in a manner different from every other scene
12639,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,in nature.
12640,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12641,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beaumont._ With you it must be merely the _place_; for I think you can
12642,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"have no attachments of friendship or affection in it, considering your"
12643,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"long absence, and the removal of all your family."
12644,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12645,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ No, I have no family connexions, and indeed can scarcely be said"
12646,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"ever to have had any; for, as you know, I was almost utterly neglected"
12647,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"after the death of my father and mother, and while all my elder brothers"
12648,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"and sisters were dispersed to one part or another, and the little"
12649,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"remaining property was disposed of, I was left with the poor people who"
12650,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"nursed me, to be brought up just as they thought proper; and the little"
12651,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,pension that was paid for me entirely ceased after a few years.
12652,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12653,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ Then how were you afterward supported?
12654,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12655,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ The honest couple who had the care of me continued to treat me
12656,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"with the greatest kindness; and poor as they were, not only maintained"
12657,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"me as a child of their own, but did all in their power to procure me"
12658,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,advantages more suited to my birth than my deserted situation. With the
12659,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"assistance of the worthy clergyman of the parish, they put me to a"
12660,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"day-school in the village, clothed me decently, and being themselves"
12661,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"sober, religious persons, took care to keep me from vice. The"
12662,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"obligations I am under to them, will, I hope, never be effaced from my"
12663,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"memory, and it is on their account alone that I have undertaken this"
12664,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,journey.
12665,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12666,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ How long did you continue with them?
12667,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12668,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Till I was thirteen. I then felt an irresistible desire to fight
12669,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,for my country; and learning by accident that a distant relation of our
12670,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"family was a captain of a man-of-war, I took leave of my worthy"
12671,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"benefactors, and set off to the seaport where he lay, the good people"
12672,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,furnishing me in the best manner they were able with necessaries for the
12673,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,journey. I shall never forget the tenderness with which they parted with
12674,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"me. It was, if possible, beyond that of the kindest parents. You know my"
12675,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"subsequent adventures, from the time of my becoming a midshipman, to my"
12676,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,present state of first-lieutenant of the Britannia. Though it is now
12677,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"fifteen years since my departure, I feel my affection for these good"
12678,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"folks stronger than ever, and could not be easy without taking the first"
12679,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,opportunity of seeing them.
12680,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12681,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ It is a great chance if they are both living.
12682,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12683,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ I happened to hear by a young man of the village, not long"
12684,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"since, that they were; but I believe much reduced in their"
12685,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,circumstances.
12686,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12687,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ Whereabouts did they live?
12688,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12689,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Just at the turning of this corner. But what’s this?—I can’t
12690,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,find the house—yet I am sure I have not forgot the situation. Surely it
12691,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"must be pulled down! Oh! my dear old friends, what can have become of"
12692,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,you?
12693,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12694,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ You had best ask that little girl.
12695,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12696,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Hark ye, my dear! do you know one John Beech, of this place?"
12697,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12698,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Girl._ What, old John Beech? O yes, very well, and Mary Beech, too."
12699,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12700,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Where do they live?
12701,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12702,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Girl._ A little farther on in the lane.
12703,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12704,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Did they not once live hereabouts?
12705,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12706,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Girl._ Yes, till Farmer Tything pulled the house down to make his"
12707,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,hop-garden.
12708,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12709,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Come with me to show me the place, and I’ll give you a penny."
12710,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12711,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Girl._ Yes, that I will. (_They walk on._) There—that low thatched"
12712,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,house—and there’s Mary spinning at the door.
12713,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12714,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ There, my dear (_gives money, and the girl goes away_). How my"
12715,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"heart beats! Surely that cannot be my nurse! Yes, I recollect her now;"
12716,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,but how very old and sickly she looks!
12717,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12718,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ Fifteen years in her life, with care and hardship, must go a"
12719,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,great way in breaking her down.
12720,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12721,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ (_going to the cottage-door_). Good morning, good woman; can you"
12722,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,give my companion and me something to drink? We are very thirsty with
12723,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,walking this hot day.
12724,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12725,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary Beech._ I have nothing better than water, sir; but if you please"
12726,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"to accept of that, I will bring you some."
12727,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12728,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ Thank you—we will trouble you for some.
12729,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12730,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Will you please to walk in out of the sun, gentlemen; ours is a"
12731,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"very poor house, indeed; but I will find you a seat to sit down on,"
12732,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,while I draw the water.
12733,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12734,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ (_to Beau._). The same good creature as ever! Let us go in.
12735,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12736,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12737,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,Scene II.—_The inside of the cottage. An old man sitting by the hearth._
12738,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12739,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ We have made bold, friend, to trouble your wife for a little"
12740,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,water.
12741,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12742,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_John._ Sit down—sit down—gentlemen. I would get up to give you my
12743,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"chair, but I have the misfortune to be lame, and am almost blind too."
12744,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12745,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Lame and blind! Oh Beaumont! (_aside_).
12746,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12747,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Ay, sir, old age will come on; and, God knows, we have very"
12748,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,little means to fence against it.
12749,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12750,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ What, have you nothing but your labour to subsist on?"
12751,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12752,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ We made that do, sir, as long as we could; but now I am hardly"
12753,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"capable of doing anything, and my poor wife can earn very little by"
12754,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"spinning, so we have been forced at last to apply to the parish."
12755,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12756,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ To the parish! Well I hope they consider the services of your
12757,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"better days, and provide for you comfortably."
12758,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12759,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Alas, sir; I am not much given to complain; but what can two"
12760,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,shillings a week do in these hard times?
12761,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12762,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Little enough, indeed! And is that all they allow you?"
12763,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12764,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ It is, sir; and we are not to have that much longer, for they"
12765,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,say we must come into the workhouse.
12766,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12767,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary_ (_entering with the water_). Here, gentlemen, the jug is clean,"
12768,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,if you can drink out of it.
12769,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12770,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ The workhouse, do you say?"
12771,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12772,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Yes, gentlemen; that makes my poor husband so uneasy—that we"
12773,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"should come in our old days to die in a workhouse. We have lived better,"
12774,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,I assure you—but we were turned out of our little farm by the great
12775,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"farmer near the church; and since then we have grown poorer and poorer,"
12776,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"and weaker and weaker, so that we have nothing to help ourselves with."
12777,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12778,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_John_ (_sobbing_). To die in a parish workhouse—I can hardly bear the
12779,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"thought of it! But God knows best, and we must submit!"
12780,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12781,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ But, my good people, have you no children to assist you?"
12782,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12783,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Our children, sir, are all dead except one that is settled a"
12784,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"long way off, and as poor as we are."
12785,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12786,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ But surely, my friends, such decent people as you seem to be,"
12787,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,must have somebody to protect you.
12788,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12789,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ No, sir; we know nobody but our neighbours, and they think the"
12790,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,workhouse good enough for the poor.
12791,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12792,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Pray, was there not a family of Harfords once in this village?"
12793,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12794,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Yes, sir, a long while ago—but they are all dead and gone, or"
12795,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,else far enough from this place.
12796,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12797,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Ay, sir, the youngest of them, and the finest child among them,"
12798,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"that I’ll say for him, was nursed in our house when we lived on the old"
12799,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"spot near the green. He was with us till he was thirteen, and a"
12800,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,sweet-behaved boy he was; I loved him as well as ever I did any of my
12801,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,own children.
12802,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12803,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ What became of him?
12804,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12805,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Why, sir, he was a fine bold-spirited boy, though the best"
12806,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"tempered creature in the world—so last war he would be a sailor, and"
12807,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"fight the French and Spaniards, and away he went, nobody could stop him,"
12808,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,and we have never heard a word of him since.
12809,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12810,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Ay, he is dead or killed, I warrant—for if he was alive, I am"
12811,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,sure nothing would keep him from coming to see his poor daddy and mamma
12812,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,as he used to call us. Many a night have I lain awake thinking of him!
12813,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12814,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ (_to Beau._). I can hold no longer.
12815,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12816,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ (_to him_). Restrain yourself awhile. Well, my friends, in"
12817,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"return for your kindness, I will tell you some news that will please"
12818,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"you. This same Harford, Edward Harford...."
12819,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12820,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Ay, that was his name—my dear Ned!—What of him, sir, is he"
12821,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,living?
12822,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12823,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Let the gentlemen speak, my dear."
12824,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12825,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ Ned Harford is now alive and well, and a lieutenant in his"
12826,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"majesty’s navy, and as brave an officer as any in the service."
12827,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12828,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ I hope you do not jest with us, sir?"
12829,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12830,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Beau._ I do not, upon my honour."
12831,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12832,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Oh, thank God—thank God—if I could but see him!"
12833,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12834,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Ay, I wish for nothing more before I die."
12835,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12836,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Here he is—here he is! My dearest, best benefactors! Here I am,"
12837,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,to pay some of the great debt of kindness I owe you. (_Clasps Mary round
12838,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"the neck, and kisses her._)"
12839,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12840,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ What—this gentleman my Ned! Ay, it is, it is—I see it, I see it!"
12841,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12842,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Oh, my old eyes!—but I know his voice now. (_Stretches out his"
12843,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"hand, which Harford grasps._)"
12844,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12845,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ My good old man! Oh that you could see me as clearly as I do
12846,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,you!
12847,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12848,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Enough—enough—it is you, and I am contented."
12849,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12850,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ O, happy day! O, happy day!"
12851,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12852,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Did you think I could ever forget you?
12853,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12854,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Oh, no; I knew you better; but how long it is since we parted!"
12855,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12856,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Mary._ Fifteen years come Whitsuntide.
12857,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12858,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ The first time I set foot in England all this long interval was
12859,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,three weeks ago.
12860,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12861,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_John._ How good you were to come to us so soon!
12862,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12863,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Mary._ What a tall strong man you are grown! but you have the same
12864,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,sweet smile as ever.
12865,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12866,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ I wish I could see him plain—but what signifies! he’s here, and"
12867,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,I hold him by the hand. Where’s the other good gentleman?
12868,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12869,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Beau._ Here—very happy to see such worthy people made so.
12870,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12871,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ He has been my dearest friend for a great many years, and I am"
12872,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,beholden to him almost as much as to you two.
12873,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12874,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Mary._ Has he? God bless him and reward him!
12875,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12876,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ I am grieved to think what you must have suffered from hardship
12877,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,and poverty. But that is all at an end—no workhouse now.
12878,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12879,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_John._ God bless you! then I shall be happy still. But we must not be
12880,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,burdensome to you.
12881,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12882,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ Don’t talk of that. As long as I have a shilling, it is my duty"
12883,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,to give you sixpence of it. Did you not take care of me when all the
12884,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"world forsook me, and treated me as your own child when I had no other"
12885,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,parent; and shall I ever forsake you in your old age! Oh never—never!
12886,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12887,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ Ay, you had always a kind heart of your own. I always used to"
12888,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,think our dear Ned would some time or other prove a blessing to us.
12889,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12890,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ You must leave this poor hut, that is not fit to keep out the"
12891,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"weather, and we must get you a snug cottage in this village or some"
12892,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,other.
12893,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12894,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Pray, my dear sir, let us die in this town, as we have always"
12895,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"lived in it. And as to a house, I believe that where old Richard"
12896,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"Carpenter used to live in is empty, if it would not be too good for us."
12897,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12898,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Harf._ What, the white cottage on the green? I remember it; it is just"
12899,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,the thing. You shall remove there this very week.
12900,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12901,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Mary._ This is beyond all my hopes and wishes!
12902,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12903,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ There you shall have a little close to keep a cow—and a girl to
12904,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"milk her, and take care of you both—and a garden well stocked with herbs"
12905,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,and roots—and a little yard for pigs and poultry; and some good new
12906,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,furniture for your house.
12907,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12908,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ O, too much—too much!"
12909,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12910,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ What makes me cry so, when so many good things are coming to us?"
12911,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12912,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ Who is the landlord of this house?
12913,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12914,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Our next neighbour, Mr. Wheatfield."
12915,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12916,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_Harf._ I’ll go and speak about it directly and then come to you again.
12917,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"Come, Beaumont. God bless you both!"
12918,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12919,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,_John._ God in heaven bless you!
12920,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,
12921,THE NATIVE VILLAGE.—A DRAMA.,"_Mary._ O, happy day. O, happy day!"

12934,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,Theodore was a boy of lively parts and engaging manners; but he had the
12935,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,failing of being extremely impatient in his temper and inclined to
12936,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"extremes. He was ardent in all his pursuits, but could bear no"
12937,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"disappointment; and if the least thing went wrong, he threw up what he"
12938,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"was about in a pet, and could not be prevailed upon to resume it. His"
12939,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"father, Mr. Carleton, had given him a bed in the garden, which he had"
12940,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,cultivated with great delight. The borders were set with double daisies
12941,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"of different colours, next to which was a row of auriculas and"
12942,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,polyanthuses. Beyond were stocks and other taller flowers and shrubs;
12943,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,and a beautiful damask rose graced the centre. This rose was just
12944,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"budding, and Theodore watched its daily progress with great interest."
12945,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"One unfortunate day, the door of the garden being left open, a drove of"
12946,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"pigs entered, and began to riot on the herbs and flowers. An alarm being"
12947,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"sounded, Theodore and the servant-boy rushed upon them, smacking their"
12948,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"whips. The whole herd, in affright, took their course across Theodore’s"
12949,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"flower-bed, on which some of them had before been grazing. Stocks,"
12950,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"daisies, and auriculas were all trampled down or torn up; and, what was"
12951,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"worst of all, a large old sow ran directly over the beautiful rose-tree,"
12952,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,and broke off its stem level with the ground. When Theodore came up and
12953,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"beheld all the mischief, and especially his favourite rose strewed on"
12954,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the soil, rage and grief choked his utterance. After standing a while"
12955,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the picture of despair, he snatched up a spade that stood near, and with"
12956,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"furious haste dug over the whole bed, and whelmed all the relics of his"
12957,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"flowers deep under the soil. This exertion being ended, he burst into"
12958,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"tears, and silently left the garden."
12959,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
12960,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"His father, who had beheld the scene at a distance, though somewhat"
12961,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"diverted at the boy’s childish violence, yet began seriously to reflect"
12962,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"on the future consequences of such a temper, if suffered to grow up"
12963,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"without restraint. He said nothing to him at the time, but in the"
12964,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,afternoon he took a walk with him into a neighbouring parish. There was
12965,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"a large wild common, and at the skirts of it a neat farmhouse with"
12966,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"fields lying round it, all well fenced, and cultivated in the best"
12967,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,manner. The air was sweetened with the bean-flower and clover. An
12968,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,orchard of fine young fruit-trees lay behind the house and before it a
12969,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"little garden, gay with all the flowers of the season. A stand of"
12970,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"beehives was on the southern side, sheltered by a thick hedge of"
12971,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,honeysuckle and sweet-brier. The farmyard was stocked with pigs and
12972,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,poultry. A herd of cows with full udders was just coming home to be
12973,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,milked. Everything wore the aspect of plenty and good management. The
12974,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"charms of the scene struck Theodore very forcibly, and he expressed his"
12975,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"pleasure in the warmest terms. “This place,” said his father, “belongs"
12976,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,to a man who is the greatest example I know of patient fortitude bearing
12977,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,up against misfortune; and all that you see is the reward of his own
12978,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,perseverance. I am a little acquainted with him; and we will go in and
12979,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"beg a draught of milk, and try if we can prevail upon him to tell us his"
12980,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,story.” Theodore willingly accompanied his father. They were received by
12981,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the farmer with cordial frankness. After they were seated, “Mr."
12982,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"Hardman,” says Mr. Carleton, “I have often heard part of your"
12983,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"adventures, but never had a regular account of the whole. If you will"
12984,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"favour me and my little boy with the story of them, we shall think"
12985,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"ourselves much obliged to you.”—“Lacka-day! sir,” said he, “there’s"
12986,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"little in them worth telling of, as far as I know. I have had my ups and"
12987,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"downs in the world, to be sure, but so have many men besides. However,"
12988,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"if you wish to hear about them, they are at your service; and I can’t"
12989,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"say but it gives me pleasure sometimes to talk over old matters, and"
12990,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,think how much better things have turned out than might have been
12991,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"expected.”—“Now I am of opinion,” said Mr. Carleton, “that from your"
12992,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,spirit and perseverance a good conclusion might always have been
12993,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"expected.”—“You are pleased to compliment, sir,” replied the farmer;"
12994,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,“but I will begin without more words:—
12995,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
12996,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,“You may perhaps have heard that my father was a man of good estate. He
12997,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"thought of nothing, poor man! but how to spend it; and he had the"
12998,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,uncommon luck to spend it twice over. For when he was obliged to sell it
12999,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the first time, it was bought in by a relation, who left it him by his"
13000,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,will. But my poor father was not a man to take warning. He fell to
13001,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"living as he had done before, and just made his estate and his life hold"
13002,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"out together. He died at the age of five-and-forty, and left his family"
13003,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"beggars. I believe he would not have taken to drinking, as he did, had"
13004,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"it not been for his impatient temper, which made him fret and vex"
13005,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"himself for every trifle, and then he had nothing for it but to drown"
13006,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,his care in liquor.
13007,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13008,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“It was my lot to be taken by my mother’s brother, who was master of a"
13009,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"merchant-ship. I served him as an apprentice several years, and"
13010,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,underwent a good deal of the usual hardship of a sailor’s life. He had
13011,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"just made me his mate in a voyage up the Mediterranean, when we had the"
13012,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,misfortune to be wrecked on the coast of Morocco. The ship struck at
13013,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"some distance from shore, and we lay a long stormy night with the waves"
13014,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"dashing over us, expecting every moment to perish. My uncle and several"
13015,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"of the crew died of fatigue and want, and by morning but four of us were"
13016,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"left alive. My companions were so disheartened, that they thought of"
13017,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,nothing but submitting to their fate. For my part I thought life still
13018,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"worth struggling for; and the weather having become calmer, I persuaded"
13019,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"them to join me in making a kind of raft, by the help of which, with"
13020,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"much toil and danger, we reached the land. Here we were seized by the"
13021,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"barbarous inhabitants, and carried up the country as slaves to the"
13022,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"emperor We were employed about some public buildings, made to work very"
13023,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"hard with the whip at our backs, and allowed nothing but water and a"
13024,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,kind of pulse. I have heard persons talk as if there was little in being
13025,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,a slave but the name; but they who have been slaves themselves I am sure
13026,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,will never make light of slavery in others. A ransom was set on our
13027,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"heads, but so high, that it seemed impossible for poor friendless"
13028,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"creatures like us ever to pay it. The thought of perpetual servitude,"
13029,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"together with the hard treatment we met with, quite overcame my poor"
13030,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,companions. They drooped and died one after another. I still thought it
13031,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"not impossible to mend my condition, and perhaps to recover my freedom."
13032,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"We worked about twelve hours in the day, and had one holyday in the"
13033,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,week. I employed my leisure time in learning to make mats and
13034,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"flag-baskets, in which I soon became so expert as to have a good many"
13035,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"for sale, and thereby got a little money to purchase better food, and"
13036,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,several small conveniences. We were afterward set to work in the
13037,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"emperor’s gardens; and here I showed so much good will and attention,"
13038,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,that I got into favour with the overseer. He had a large garden of his
13039,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"own; and he made interest for me to be suffered to work for him alone,"
13040,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,on the condition of paying a man to do my duty. I soon became so useful
13041,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to him, that he treated me more like a hired servant than a slave, and"
13042,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"gave me regular wages. I learned the language of the country, and I"
13043,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,might have passed my time comfortably enough could I have accommodated
13044,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"myself to their manners and religion, and forgotten my native land. I"
13045,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,saved all I could in order to purchase my freedom; but the ransom was so
13046,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"high, that I had little prospect of being able to do it for some years"
13047,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to come. A circumstance, however, happened which brought it about at"
13048,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,once. Some villains one night laid a plot to murder my master and
13049,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,plunder his house. I slept in a little shed in the garden where the
13050,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"tools lay; and being awaked by a noise, I saw four men break through the"
13051,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"fence, and walk up an alley toward the house. I crept out with a spade"
13052,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"in my hand, and silently followed them. They made a hole with"
13053,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,instruments in the house-wall big enough for a man to enter at. Two of
13054,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"them had got in, and the third was beginning to enter, when I rushed"
13055,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"forward, and with a blow of my spade clove the scull of one of the"
13056,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"robbers, and gave the other such a stroke on the shoulder as disabled"
13057,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,him. I then made a loud outcry to alarm the family. My master and his
13058,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"son, who lay in the house, got up, and having let me in, we secured the"
13059,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"two others, after a sharp conflict, in which I received a severe wound"
13060,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"with a dagger. My master, who looked upon me as his preserver, had all"
13061,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"possible care taken of me, and as soon as I was cured made me a present"
13062,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"of my liberty. He would fain have kept me with him, but my mind was so"
13063,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"much bent on returning to my native country, that I immediately set out"
13064,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to the nearest seaport, and took my passage in a vessel going to"
13065,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,Gibraltar.
13066,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13067,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,“From this place I returned in the first ship for England. As soon as we
13068,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"arrived in the Downs, and I was rejoicing at the sight of the white"
13069,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"cliffs, a man-of-war’s boat came on board, and pressed into the king’s"
13070,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,service all of us who were seamen. I could not but think it hard that
13071,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"this should be my welcome at home after a long slavery, but there was no"
13072,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"remedy. I resolved to do my duty in my station, and leave the rest to"
13073,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"Providence. I was abroad during the remainder of the war, and saw many a"
13074,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,stout fellow sink under disease and despondence. My knowledge of
13075,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"seamanship got me promoted to the post of a petty officer, and at the"
13076,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"peace I was paid off, and received a pretty sum for wages and"
13077,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,prize-money. With this I set off for London. I had experienced too much
13078,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"distress from want to be inclined to squander away my money, so I put it"
13079,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"into a banker’s hands, and began to look out for some new way of life."
13080,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13081,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“Unfortunately, there were some things of which I had no more experience"
13082,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"than a child, and the tricks of London were among these. An"
13083,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,advertisement offering extraordinary advantages to a partner in a
13084,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"commercial concern who could bring a small capital, tempted me to make"
13085,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,inquiry about the matter; and I was soon cajoled by a plausible artful
13086,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"fellow to venture my whole stock in it. The business was a manufacture,"
13087,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"about which I knew nothing at all; but as I was not afraid of my labour,"
13088,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"I set about working as they directed me, with great diligence, and"
13089,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"thought all was going on prosperously. One morning, on coming to the"
13090,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"office, I found my partners decamped; and the same day I was arrested"
13091,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,for a considerable sum due by the partnership. It was in vain for me to
13092,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"think of getting bail, so I was obliged to go to prison. Here I should"
13093,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"have been half starved, but for my Moorish trade of matmaking, by the"
13094,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,help of which I bettered my condition for some months; when the
13095,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"creditors, finding that nothing could be got out of me, suffered me to"
13096,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,be set at liberty.
13097,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13098,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“I was now in the wide world without a farthing or a friend, but I,"
13099,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"thank God, had limbs and health left."
13100,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13101,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“I did not choose to trust the sea again, but preferred my other new"
13102,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"trade of gardening; so I applied to a nurseryman near town, and was"
13103,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"received as a day-labourer. I set myself cheerfully at work, taking care"
13104,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to be in the grounds the first man in the morning, and the last at"
13105,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,night. I acquainted my employer with all the practices I had observed in
13106,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"Morocco, and got him, in return, to instruct me in his own. In time, I"
13107,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"came to be considered as a skilful workman, and was advanced to higher"
13108,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"wages. My affairs were in a flourishing state. I was well fed, and"
13109,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"comfortably lodged, and saved money into the bargain. About this time I"
13110,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"fell in company with a young woman at service, very notable and well"
13111,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"behaved, who seemed well qualified for a wife to a working-man. I"
13112,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"ventured to make an offer to her, which proved not disagreeable; and"
13113,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"after we had calculated a little how we were to live, we married. I took"
13114,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"a cottage with an acre or two of land to it, and my wife’s saving"
13115,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"furnished our house, and bought a cow. All my leisure time I spent upon"
13116,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"my piece of ground, which I made very productive, and the profits of my"
13117,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"cow, with my wages, supported us very well. No mortal, I think, could be"
13118,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"happier than I was after a hard day’s work, by my own fireside, with my"
13119,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"wife beside me, and our little infant on my knee."
13120,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13121,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“After this way of life had lasted two or three years, a gentleman who"
13122,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"had dealt largely with my master for young plants, asked him if he could"
13123,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"recommend an honest industrious man for a tenant, upon some land that he"
13124,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"had lately taken in from the sea. My master, willing to do me a"
13125,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"kindness, mentioned me. I was tempted by the proposal, and going down to"
13126,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"view the premises, I took a farm upon a lease at a low rent, and removed"
13127,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"my family and goods to it, one hundred and fifty miles from London."
13128,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"There was ground enough for money, but much was left to be done for it"
13129,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"in draining, manuring, and fencing. Then it required more stock than I"
13130,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"was able to furnish; so, though unwilling, I was obliged to borrow some"
13131,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"money of my landlord, who let me have it at a moderate interest. I began"
13132,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"with a good heart, and worked late and early to put things into the best"
13133,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,condition. My first misfortune was that the place proved unhealthy to
13134,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"us. I fell into a lingering ague, which pulled me down much, and"
13135,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"hindered my business. My wife got a slow fever, and so did our eldest"
13136,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,child (we had now two.) The poor child died; and what with grief and
13137,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"illness, my wife had much ado to recover. Then the rot got among my"
13138,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"sheep, and carried off the best part of my stock. I bore up against"
13139,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"distress as well as I could; and by the kindness of my landlord, was"
13140,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"enabled to bring things tolerably about again. We regained our health,"
13141,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,and began to be seasoned to the climate. As we were cheering ourselves
13142,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"with the prospect of better times, a dreadful storm arose—it was one"
13143,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,night in February—I shall never forget it—and drove the spring tide with
13144,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"such fury against our sea-banks, that they gave way. The water rushed in"
13145,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"with such force, that all was presently a sea. Two hours before daylight"
13146,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"I was awakened by the noise of the waves dashing against our house, and"
13147,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,bursting in at the door. My wife and I and the two children (the younger
13148,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,but four weeks old) slept on a ground floor. We had just time to carry
13149,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the children up stairs, before all was afloat in the room. When day"
13150,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"appeared, we could see nothing from the windows but water. All the"
13151,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"outhouses, ricks, and utensils were swept away, and all the cattle and"
13152,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"sheep drowned. The sea kept rising, and the force of the current bore so"
13153,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"hard against our house, that we thought every moment it must fall. We"
13154,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"clasped our babies to our breasts, and expected nothing but present"
13155,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"death. At length, we spied a boat coming to us. With a good deal of"
13156,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"difficulty it got under our window, and took us in with a servant-maid"
13157,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,and boy. A few clothes was all the property we saved; and we had not
13158,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"left the house half an hour, before it fell, and in a minute nothing was"
13159,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to be seen of it. Not only the farmhouse, but the farm itself was gone."
13160,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13161,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“I was now again a ruined man, and, what was worse, I had three partners"
13162,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"in my ruin. My wife and I looked at one another, and then at our little"
13163,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"ones, and wept. Neither of us had a word of comfort to say. At last,"
13164,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"thought I, this country is not Morocco, however. Here are good souls"
13165,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"that will pity our case, and perhaps relieve us. Then I have a"
13166,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"character, and a pair of hands. Things are bad but they might have been"
13167,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"worse. I took my wife by the hand, and knelt down. She did the same. I"
13168,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"thanked God for his mercy in saving our lives, and prayed that he would"
13169,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"continue to protect us. We rose up with lightened hearts, and were able"
13170,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,to talk calmly about our condition. It was my desire to return to my
13171,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"former master, the nurseryman; but how to convey my family so far"
13172,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"without money was the difficulty. Indeed I was much worse than nothing,"
13173,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,for I owed a good deal to my landlord. He came down upon the news of the
13174,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"misfortune, and though his own losses were heavy, he not only forgave my"
13175,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"debt and released me from all obligations, but made me a small present."
13176,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,Some charitable neighbours did the like; but I was most of all affected
13177,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"by the kindness of our late maid-servant, who insisted upon our"
13178,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,accepting of a crown which she had saved out of her wages. Poor soul! we
13179,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"had always treated her like one of ourselves, and she felt for us like"
13180,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,one.
13181,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13182,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“As soon as we had got some necessaries, and the weather was tolerable,"
13183,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,we set out on our long march. My wife carried her infant in her arms. I
13184,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"took the bigger child on my back, and a bundle of clothes in my hand. We"
13185,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"could walk but a few miles a day, but we now and then got a lift in an"
13186,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"empty wagon or cart, which was a great help to us. One day we met with a"
13187,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"farmer returning with his team from market, who let me ride, and entered"
13188,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"into conversation with me. I told him of my adventures, by which he"
13189,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,seemed much interested; and learning that I was skilled in managing
13190,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"trees, he acquainted me that a nobleman in his neighbourhood was making"
13191,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"great plantations, and would very likely be glad to engage me; and he"
13192,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,offered to carry us to the place. As all I was seeking was a living by
13193,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"my labour, I thought the sooner I got it the better; so I thankfully"
13194,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"accepted his offer. He took us to the nobleman’s steward, and made known"
13195,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,our case. The steward wrote to my old master for a character; and
13196,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"receiving a favourable one, he hired me as a principal manager of a new"
13197,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"plantation, and settled me and my family in a snug cottage near it. He"
13198,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"advanced us somewhat for furniture and present subsistence, and we had"
13199,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,once more a _home_. O sir! how many blessings are contained in that word
13200,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,to those who have known the want of it!
13201,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13202,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,“I entered upon my new employment with as much satisfaction as if I was
13203,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,taking possession of an estate. My wife had enough to do in taking care
13204,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"of the house and children; so it lay with me to provide for all, and I"
13205,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"may say that I was not idle. Besides my weekly pay from the steward, I"
13206,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,contrived to make a little money at leisure times by pruning and
13207,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,dressing gentlemen’s fruit-trees. I was allowed a piece of waste ground
13208,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"behind the house for a garden, and I spent a good deal of labour in"
13209,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,bringing it into order. My old master sent me down for a present some
13210,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"choice young trees and flower-roots, which I planted, and they throve"
13211,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,wonderfully. Things went on almost as well as I could desire. The
13212,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"situation being dry and healthy, my wife recovered her lost bloom, and"
13213,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,the children sprung up like my plants. I began to hope that I was almost
13214,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,out of the reach of further misfortune; but it was not so ordered.
13215,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13216,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“I had been three years in this situation, and increased my family with"
13217,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"another child, when my lord died. He was succeeded by a very dissipated"
13218,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"young man, deep in debt, who presently put a stop to the planting and"
13219,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"improving of the estate, and sent orders to turn off all the workmen."
13220,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"This was a great blow to me; however, I still hoped to be allowed to"
13221,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"keep my little house and garden, and I thought I could then maintain"
13222,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"myself as a nurseryman and gardener. But a new steward was sent down,"
13223,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,with directions to rack the tenants to the utmost. He asked me as much
13224,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,rent for the place as if I had found the garden ready made to my hands;
13225,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"and when I told him it was impossible for me to pay it, he gave me"
13226,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,notice to quit immediately. He would neither suffer me to take away my
13227,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"trees and plants, nor allow me anything for them. His view, I found, was"
13228,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to put in a favourite of his own, and set him up at my expense. I"
13229,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"remonstrated against this cruel injustice, but could obtain nothing but"
13230,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,hard words. As I saw it would be the ruin of me to be turned out in that
13231,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"manner, I determined, rather hastily, to go up to London, and plead my"
13232,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"cause with my new lord. I took a sorrowful leave of my family, and"
13233,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"walking to the next market-town, I got a place on the outside of the"
13234,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"stage-coach. When we were within thirty or forty miles of London, the"
13235,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"coachman overturned the carriage, and I pitched directly on my head, and"
13236,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,was taken up senseless. Nobody knew anything about me; so I was carried
13237,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"to the next village, where the overseer had me taken to the parish"
13238,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"workhouse. Here I lay a fortnight, much neglected, before I came to my"
13239,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"senses. As soon as I became sensible of my condition, I was almost"
13240,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"distracted in thinking of the distress of my poor wife, who was near"
13241,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"lying-in, must be under on my account, not hearing anything of me. I lay"
13242,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"another fortnight before I was fit to travel, for besides the hurt on my"
13243,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"head, I had a broken collarbone, and several bruises."
13244,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13245,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“My money had somehow all got out of my pocket, and I had no other means"
13246,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,of getting away than by being passed to my own parish. I returned in sad
13247,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"plight, indeed, and found my wife very ill in bed. My children were"
13248,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"crying about her, and almost starving. We should now have been quite"
13249,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"lost, had I not raised a little money by selling our furniture; for I"
13250,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"was yet unable to work. As soon as my wife was somewhat recovered, we"
13251,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,were forced to quit our house. I cried like a child on leaving my
13252,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"blooming garden and flourishing plantations, and was almost tempted to"
13253,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"demolish them, rather than that another should unjustly reap the fruit"
13254,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,of my labours. But I checked myself and I am glad that I did. We took
13255,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"lodgings in a neighbouring village, and I went round among the gentlemen"
13256,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,of the country to see if I could get a little employment. In the
13257,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"meantime, the former steward came down to settle accounts with his"
13258,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"successor, and was much concerned to find me in such a situation. He was"
13259,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"a very able and honest man, and had been engaged by another nobleman to"
13260,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"superintend a large improvable estate, in a distant part of the kingdom."
13261,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"He told me, if I would try my fortune with him once more he would"
13262,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"endeavour to procure me a new settlement. I had nothing to lose, and,"
13263,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"therefore, was willing enough to run any hazard, but I was destitute of"
13264,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"means to convey my family to such a distance. My good friend, who was"
13265,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"much provoked at the injustice of the new steward, said so much to him,"
13266,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,that he brought him to make me an allowance for my garden; and with that
13267,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,I was enabled to make another removal. It was to the place I now
13268,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,inhabit.
13269,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13270,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"“When I came here, sir, all this farm was a naked common like that you"
13271,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"crossed in coming. My lord got an enclosure-bill for his part of it, and"
13272,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the steward divided it into different farms, and let it on improving"
13273,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"leases to several tenants. A dreary spot to be sure it looked at first,"
13274,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,enough to sink a man’s heart to sit down upon it. I had a little
13275,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,unfinished cottage given me to live in; and as I had nothing to stock a
13276,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"farm, I was for some years employed as head labourer and planter about"
13277,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"the new enclosures. By very hard working and saving, together with a"
13278,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"little help, I was at length enabled to take a small part of the ground"
13279,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"I now occupy. I had various discouragements, from bad seasons and other"
13280,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,accidents. One year the distemper carried off four out of seven cows
13281,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,that I kept; another year I lost two of my best horses. A high wind once
13282,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"almost entirely destroyed an orchard I had just planted, and blew down"
13283,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,my biggest barn. But I was too much used to misfortunes to be easily
13284,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"disheartened, and my way always was to set about repairing them in the"
13285,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"best manner I could, and leave the rest to Heaven. This method seems to"
13286,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,have answered at last. I have now gone on many years in a course of
13287,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"continued prosperity, adding field to field, increasing my stock, and"
13288,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"bringing up a numerous family with credit. My dear wife, who was my"
13289,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"faithful partner through so much distress, continues to share my"
13290,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"prosperous state; and few couples in the kingdom, I believe, have more"
13291,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"cause to be thankful for their lot. This, sir, is my history. You see it"
13292,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,contains nothing very extraordinary; but if it impresses on the mind of
13293,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,this young gentleman the maxim that patience and perseverance will
13294,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"scarcely fail of a good issue in the end, the time you have spent in"
13295,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,listening to it will not entirely be lost.”
13296,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13297,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,Mr. Carleton thanked the good farmer very heartily for the amusement and
13298,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"instruction he had afforded them, and took leave with many expressions"
13299,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"of regard. Theodore and he walked home, talking by the way of what they"
13300,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,had heard.
13301,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,
13302,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"Next morning, Mr. C. looking out of the window, saw Theodore hard at"
13303,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"work in his garden. He was carefully disinterring his buried flowers,"
13304,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"trimming and cleaning them, and planting them anew. He had got the"
13305,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"gardener to cut a slip of the broken rose-tree, and set it in the middle"
13306,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,to give it a chance of growing. By noon everything was laid smooth and
13307,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"neat, and the bed was well filled. All its splendour, indeed, was gone"
13308,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,"for the present, but it seemed in a hopeful way to revive again."
13309,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,Theodore looked with pleasure over his work; but his father felt more
13310,PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—A STORY.,pleasure in witnessing the first-fruits of Farmer Hardman’s story.

13332,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,To forward pleasant conversation;
13333,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,And I should be a stupid bird

13355,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,Well!—who’s the favoured lover?
13356,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,"I met hard by, in quaker suit,"
13357,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,A youth sedately grave and mute;
13358,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,"And from the maxim, like to like,"
13359,THE GOLDFINCH AND LINNET.,Perhaps the _sober youth_ might strike:

13411,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13412,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"“Good news! great news! glorious news!” cried young Oswald, as he"
13413,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"entered his father’s house. “We have got a complete victory, and have"
13414,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,killed I don’t know how many thousands of the enemy; and we are to have
13415,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,bonfires and illuminations!”
13416,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13417,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"“And so,” said his father, “you think that killing a great many"
13418,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,thousands of human creatures is a thing to be very glad about?”
13419,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13420,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Oswald._ No—I do not quite think so, neither: but surely it is right to"
13421,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,be glad that our country has gained a great advantage.
13422,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13423,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Father._ No doubt, it is right to wish well to our country, as far as"
13424,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,its prosperity can be promoted without injuring the rest of mankind. But
13425,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,wars are very seldom to the real advantage of any nation; and when they
13426,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"are ever so useful or necessary, so many dreadful evils attend them,"
13427,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"that a humane man will scarcely rejoice in them, if he considers at all"
13428,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,on the subject.
13429,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13430,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Os._ But if our enemies would do us a great deal of mischief, and we"
13431,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"prevent it by beating them, have we not a right to be glad of it?"
13432,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13433,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Fa._ Alas! we are in general little judges which of the parties has the
13434,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"most mischievous intentions. Commonly, they are both in the wrong, and"
13435,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,success will make both of them unjust and unreasonable. But putting this
13436,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"out of the question, he who rejoices in the event of a battle, rejoices"
13437,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,in the misery of many thousands of his species; and the thought of that
13438,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,should make him pause a little. Suppose a surgeon were to come with a
13439,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"smiling countenance, and tell us triumphantly that he had cut off half a"
13440,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"dozen legs to day, what would you think of him?"
13441,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13442,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Os._ I should think him very hard-hearted.
13443,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13444,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Fa._ And yet those operations are done for the benefit of the
13445,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"sufferers, and by their own desire. But in a battle, the probability is,"
13446,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,that none of those engaged on either side have any interest at all in
13447,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"the cause they are fighting for, and most of them come there because"
13448,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"they cannot help it. In this battle that you are so rejoiced about,"
13449,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"there have been ten thousand men killed on the spot, and nearly as many"
13450,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,wounded.
13451,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13452,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Os._ On both sides?
13453,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13454,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Fa._ Yes—but they are _men_ on both sides. Consider now, that the ten"
13455,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"thousand sent out of the world in this morning’s work, though they are"
13456,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"past feeling themselves, have left probably two persons each, on an"
13457,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"average, to lament their loss, parents, wives, or children. Here are"
13458,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"then twenty thousand people made unhappy, at one stroke on their"
13459,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"account. This, however, is hardly so dreadful to think of, as the"
13460,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"condition of the wounded. At the moment we are talking, eight or ten"
13461,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"thousand more are lying in agony, torn with shot, or gashed with cuts,"
13462,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"their wounds all festering, some hourly to die a most excruciating"

13475,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Fa._ True—they do _not_ think of them. If they did, I cannot suppose"
13476,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,they would be so void of feeling as to enjoy themselves in merriment
13477,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,when so many of their fellow-creatures are made miserable. Do you not
13478,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"remember, when poor Dickens had his legs broken to pieces by a loaded"
13479,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"wagon, how all the town pitied him?"
13480,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13481,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Os._ Yes, very well. I could not sleep the night after for thinking of"
13482,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,him.

13484,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Fa._ But here are thousands suffering as much as he, and we scarce"
13485,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,bestow a single thought on them. If any one of these poor creatures were
13486,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"before our eyes, we should probably feel much more than we do now for"
13487,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"them altogether. Shall I tell you a story of a soldier’s fortune, that"
13488,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,came to my own knowledge?
13489,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13490,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Os._ Yes; pray, do."
13491,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13492,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Fa._ In the village where I went to school, there was an honest"
13493,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"industrious weaver and his wife, who had an only son, named Walter, just"
13494,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"come to man’s estate. Walter was a good and dutiful lad, and a clever"
13495,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"workman, so that he was a great help to his parents. One unlucky day,"
13496,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"having gone to the next market-town with some work, he met with a"
13497,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"companion, who took him to the alehouse and treated him. As he was"
13498,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"coming away, a recruiting sergeant entered the room, who seeing Walter"
13499,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"to be a likely young fellow, had a great mind to entrap him. He"
13500,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,persuaded him to sit down again and take a glass with him; and kept him
13501,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"in talk with fine stories about a soldier’s life, till Walter got"
13502,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,fuddled before he was aware. The sergeant then clapped a shilling into
13503,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"his hand to drink his majesty’s health, and told him he was enlisted. He"
13504,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"was kept there all night, and next morning was taken before a magistrate"
13505,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"to be sworn in. Walter had now become sober, and was very sorry for what"
13506,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,he had done: but he was told that he could not get off without paying a
13507,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,guinea smart money. This he knew not how to raise; and being likewise
13508,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"afraid and ashamed to face his friends, he took the oath and"
13509,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"bounty-money, and marched away with the sergeant, without ever returning"
13510,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"home. His poor father and mother, when they heard of the affair, were"
13511,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"almost heart-broken; and a young woman in the village, who was his"
13512,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"sweetheart, had like to have gone distracted. Walter sent them a line"
13513,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"from the first stage, to bid them farewell, and comfort them. He joined"
13514,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"his regiment, which soon embarked for Germany, where it continued till"
13515,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"the peace. Walter once or twice sent word home of his welfare, but for"
13516,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,the last year nothing was heard of him.
13517,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13518,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Os._ Where was he then?
13519,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13520,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Fa._ You shall hear. One summer’s evening, a man in an old red coat,"
13521,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"hobbling on crutches, was seen to enter the village. His countenance was"
13522,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"pale and sickly, his cheeks hollow, and his whole appearance bespoke"
13523,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"extreme wretchedness. Several people gathered round him, looking"
13524,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,earnestly in his face. Among these a young woman having gazed at him a
13525,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"while, cried out, “My Walter!” and fainted away. Walter fell on the"
13526,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,ground beside her. His father and mother being fetched by some of the
13527,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"spectators, came and took him in their arms, weeping bitterly. I saw the"
13528,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"whole scene, and shall never forget it. At length, the neighbours helped"
13529,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"them into the house, where Walter told them the following story:—"
13530,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13531,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"“At the last great battle that our troops gained in Germany, I was among"
13532,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"the first engaged, and received a shot that broke my thigh. I fell, and"
13533,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,presently after our regiment was forced to retreat. A squadron of the
13534,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,enemy’s horse came galloping down upon us. A trooper making a blow at me
13535,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"with his sabre as I lay, I lifted up my arm to save my head, and got a"
13536,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,cut which divided all the sinews at the back of my wrist. Soon after the
13537,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"enemy were driven back, and came across us again. A horse set his foot"
13538,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"on my side, and broke three of my ribs. The action was long and bloody,"
13539,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,and the wounded on both sides were left on the field all night. A
13540,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,dreadful night it was to me you may think! I had fainted through loss of
13541,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"blood, and when I recovered, I was tormented with thirst, and the cold"
13542,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,air made my wounds smart intolerably. About noon next day wagons came to
13543,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"carry away those who remained alive; and I, with a number of others, was"
13544,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,put into one to be conveyed to the next town. The motion of the carriage
13545,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,was terrible for my broken bones—every jolt went to my heart. We were
13546,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"taken to an hospital, which was crammed as full as it could hold; and we"
13547,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"should all have been suffocated with the heat and stench, had not a"
13548,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"fever broke out, which soon thinned our numbers. I took it, and was"
13549,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"twice given over; however, I struggled through. But my wounds proved so"
13550,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"difficult to heal, that it was almost a twelvemonth before I could be"
13551,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"discharged. A great deal of the bone in my thigh came away in splinters,"
13552,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,and left the limb crooked and useless as you see. I entirely lost the
13553,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,use of three fingers of my right hand; and my broken ribs made me spit
13554,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"blood a long time, and have left a cough and difficulty of breathing,"
13555,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"which I believe will bring me to my grave. I was sent home, and"
13556,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"discharged from the army, and I have begged my way hither as well as I"
13557,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,could. I am told that the peace has left the affairs of my country just
13558,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,as they were before; but who will restore me my health and limbs? I am
13559,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"put on the list for a Chelsea pensioner, which will support me, if I"
13560,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"live to receive it, without being a burden to my friends. That is all"
13561,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,that remains for Walter now.”
13562,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13563,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,_Os._ Poor Walter! What became of him afterward?
13564,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13565,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"_Father._ The wound in his thigh broke out afresh, and discharged more"
13566,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"splinters after a great deal of pain and fever. As winter came on, his"
13567,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"cough increased. He wasted to a skeleton, and died the next spring. The"
13568,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"young woman, his sweetheart, sat up with him every night to the last;"
13569,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"and soon after his death, she fell into a consumption, and followed him."
13570,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"The old people, deprived of the stay and comfort of their age, fell into"
13571,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"despair and poverty, and were taken into the workhouse, where they ended"
13572,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,their days.
13573,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,
13574,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,This was the history of _Walter the soldier_. It has been that of
13575,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,"thousands more; and will be that of many a poor fellow, over whose fate"
13576,THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.,you are now rejoicing. Such is the _price of a victory_!

13581,GOOD COMPANY.,GOOD COMPANY.
13582,GOOD COMPANY.,
13583,GOOD COMPANY.,
13584,GOOD COMPANY.,"“Be sure, Frederick, always keep _good company_,” was the final"
13585,GOOD COMPANY.,"admonition of Mr. Lofty, on dismissing his son to the University."
13586,GOOD COMPANY.,
13587,GOOD COMPANY.,"“I entreat you, Henry, always to choose _good company_,” said Mr. Manly,"
13588,GOOD COMPANY.,on parting with his son to an apprenticeship in a neighbouring town.
13589,GOOD COMPANY.,
13590,GOOD COMPANY.,But it was impossible for two people to mean more differently by the
13591,GOOD COMPANY.,same words.
13592,GOOD COMPANY.,
13593,GOOD COMPANY.,"In Mr. Lofty’s idea, _good_ company was that of persons superior to"
13594,GOOD COMPANY.,ourselves in rank and fortune. By this alone he estimated it: and the
13595,GOOD COMPANY.,"degrees of comparison, better and best, were made exactly to correspond"
13596,GOOD COMPANY.,"to such a scale. Thus, if an esquire was _good_ company, a baronet was"
13597,GOOD COMPANY.,"_better_, and a lord _best of all_, provided that he was not a _poor_"
13598,GOOD COMPANY.,"lord, for in that case, a rich gentleman might be at least as good. For"
13599,GOOD COMPANY.,"as, according to Mr. Lofty’s maxim, the great purpose for which"
13600,GOOD COMPANY.,companions were to be chosen was to advance a young man in the world by
13601,GOOD COMPANY.,"their credit and interest, those were to be preferred who afforded the"
13602,GOOD COMPANY.,best prospects in this respect.
13603,GOOD COMPANY.,
13604,GOOD COMPANY.,"Mr. Manly, on the other hand, understood by _good_ company, that which"
13605,GOOD COMPANY.,"was improving to the morals and understanding; and by the _best_, that"
13606,GOOD COMPANY.,"which, to a high degree of these qualities, added true politeness of"
13607,GOOD COMPANY.,manners. As superior advantages in education to a certain point
13608,GOOD COMPANY.,"accompany superiority of condition, he wished his son to prefer as"
13609,GOOD COMPANY.,companions those whose situation in life had afforded them the
13610,GOOD COMPANY.,opportunity of being well educated; but he was far from desiring him to
13611,GOOD COMPANY.,"shun connexions with worth and talents, wherever he should find them."
13612,GOOD COMPANY.,
13613,GOOD COMPANY.,"Mr. Lofty had an utter aversion to _low company_, by which he meant"
13614,GOOD COMPANY.,"inferiors, people of no fashion and figure, shabby fellows whom nobody"
13615,GOOD COMPANY.,knows.
13616,GOOD COMPANY.,
13617,GOOD COMPANY.,"Mr. Manly equally disliked _low company_, understanding by it persons of"
13618,GOOD COMPANY.,mean habits and vulgar conversation.
13619,GOOD COMPANY.,
13620,GOOD COMPANY.,A great part of Mr. Manly’s _good_ company was Mr. Lofty’s _low_
13621,GOOD COMPANY.,company; and not a few of Mr. Lofty’s very _best_ company were Mr.
13622,GOOD COMPANY.,Manly’s very _worst_.
13623,GOOD COMPANY.,
13624,GOOD COMPANY.,"Each of the sons understood his father’s meaning, and followed his"
13625,GOOD COMPANY.,advice.
13626,GOOD COMPANY.,
13627,GOOD COMPANY.,"Frederick, from the time of his entrance at the University, commenced"
13628,GOOD COMPANY.,"what is called a _tuft-hunter_, from the tuft in the cap worn by young"
13629,GOOD COMPANY.,noblemen. He took pains to insinuate himself into the good graces of all
13630,GOOD COMPANY.,"the young men of high fashion in his college, and became a constant"
13631,GOOD COMPANY.,companion in their schemes of frolic and dissipation. They treated him
13632,GOOD COMPANY.,"with an insolent familiarity, often bordering upon contempt; but"
13633,GOOD COMPANY.,"following another maxim of his father, “one must stoop to rise,” he took"
13634,GOOD COMPANY.,"it all in good part. He totally neglected study as unnecessary, and"
13635,GOOD COMPANY.,"indeed inconsistent with his plan. He spent a great deal of money, with"
13636,GOOD COMPANY.,"which his father, finding that it went in _good company_, at first"
13637,GOOD COMPANY.,"supplied him freely. In time, however, his expenses amounted to so much,"
13638,GOOD COMPANY.,"that Mr. Lofty, who kept good company too, found it difficult to answer"
13639,GOOD COMPANY.,his demands. A considerable sum that he lost at play with one of his
13640,GOOD COMPANY.,"noble friends increased the difficulty. If it were not paid, the"
13641,GOOD COMPANY.,disgrace of not having discharged a _debt of honour_ would lose him all
13642,GOOD COMPANY.,the favour he had acquired; yet the money could not be raised without
13643,GOOD COMPANY.,greatly embarrassing his father’s affairs.
13644,GOOD COMPANY.,
13645,GOOD COMPANY.,"In the midst of this perplexity, Mr. Lofty died, leaving behind him a"
13646,GOOD COMPANY.,"large family, and very little property. Frederick came up to town, and"
13647,GOOD COMPANY.,soon dissipated in _good company_ the scanty portion that came to his
13648,GOOD COMPANY.,"share. Having neither industry, knowledge, nor reputation, he was then"
13649,GOOD COMPANY.,"obliged to become an humble dependant on the great, flattering all their"
13650,GOOD COMPANY.,"follies, and ministering to their vices, treated by them with mortifying"
13651,GOOD COMPANY.,"neglect, and equally despised and detested by the rest of the world."
13652,GOOD COMPANY.,
13653,GOOD COMPANY.,"Henry, in the meantime, entered with spirit into the business of his new"
13654,GOOD COMPANY.,"profession, and employed his leisure in cultivating an acquaintance with"
13655,GOOD COMPANY.,a few select friends. These were partly young men in a situation similar
13656,GOOD COMPANY.,"to his own, partly persons already settled in life, but all"
13657,GOOD COMPANY.,distinguished by propriety of conduct and improved understandings. From
13658,GOOD COMPANY.,"all of them he learned something valuable, but he was more particularly"
13659,GOOD COMPANY.,"indebted to two of them, who were in a station of life inferior to that"
13660,GOOD COMPANY.,"of the rest. One was a watchmaker, an excellent mechanic and tolerable"
13661,GOOD COMPANY.,"mathematician, and well acquainted with the construction and use of all"
13662,GOOD COMPANY.,the instruments employed in experimental philosophy. The other was a
13663,GOOD COMPANY.,"young druggist, who had a good knowledge of chymistry, and frequently"
13664,GOOD COMPANY.,employed himself in chymical operations and experiments. Both of them
13665,GOOD COMPANY.,"were men of very decent manners, and took a pleasure in communicating"
13666,GOOD COMPANY.,their knowledge to such as showed a taste for similar studies. Henry
13667,GOOD COMPANY.,"frequently visited them, and derived much useful information from their"
13668,GOOD COMPANY.,"instructions, for which he ever expressed great thankfulness. These"
13669,GOOD COMPANY.,various occupations and good examples effectually preserved him from the
13670,GOOD COMPANY.,"errors of youth, and he passed his time with credit and satisfaction. He"
13671,GOOD COMPANY.,"had the same misfortune with Frederick, just as he was ready to come out"
13672,GOOD COMPANY.,"into the world, of losing his father, upon whom the support of the"
13673,GOOD COMPANY.,"family chiefly depended; but in the character he had established, and"
13674,GOOD COMPANY.,"the knowledge he had acquired, he found an effectual resource. One of"
13675,GOOD COMPANY.,his young friends proposed to him a partnership in a manufactory he had
13676,GOOD COMPANY.,"just set up at considerable expense, requiring for his share only the"
13677,GOOD COMPANY.,"exertion of his talents and industry. Henry accepted the offer, and made"
13678,GOOD COMPANY.,"such good use of the skill in mechanics and chymistry he had acquired,"
13679,GOOD COMPANY.,"that he introduced many improvements into the manufactory, and rendered"
13680,GOOD COMPANY.,"it a very profitable concern. He lived prosperous and independent, and"
13681,GOOD COMPANY.,retained in manhood all the friendships of his youth.

13689,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"It was a delightful evening about the end of August. The sun, setting in"
13690,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"a pure sky, illuminated the tops of the western hills, and tipped the"
13691,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,opposite trees with a yellow lustre.

13693,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"A traveller, with sunburnt cheeks and dusty feet, strong and active,"
13694,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"having a knapsack at his back, had gained the summit of a steep ascent,"
13695,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,and stood gazing on the plain below.
13696,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13697,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"This was a wide tract of champaign country, checkered with villages,"
13698,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,whose towers and spires peeped above the trees in which they were
13699,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"embosomed. The space between them was chiefly arable land, from which"
13700,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,the last products of the harvest were busily carrying away.

13702,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"A rivulet wound through the plain, its course marked with gray willows."
13703,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"On its banks were verdant meadows, covered with lowing herds, moving"
13704,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"slowly to the milkmaids, who came tripping along with pails on their"
13705,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,heads. A thick wood clothed the side of a gentle eminence rising from
13706,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"the water, crowned with the ruins of an ancient castle."
13707,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13708,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"Edward (that was the traveller’s name) dropped on one knee, and clasping"
13709,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"his hands, exclaimed, “Welcome, welcome, my dear native land. Many a"
13710,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"sweet spot have I seen since I left thee, but none so sweet as thou!"
13711,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,Never has thy dear image been out of my memory; and now with what
13712,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"transport do I retrace all thy charms! O, receive me again, never more"
13713,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"to quit thee!” So saying, he threw himself on the turf; and having"
13714,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"kissed it, rose and proceeded on his journey."
13715,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13716,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"As he descended into the plain, he overtook a little group of children,"
13717,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"merrily walking along the path, and stopping now and then to gather"

13732,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13733,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,The little innocents told their names. Edward’s heart leaped at the

13735,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13736,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“And what is _your_ name, my dear?” said he to a pretty girl, somewhat"
13737,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"older than the rest, who hung back shyly, and held the hand of a ruddy,"

13768,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"when all at once his countenance changed; he leaped upon him, licked his"
13769,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"hand, wagged his tail, murmured in a soft voice, and seemed quite"
13770,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"overcome with joy. Edward stooped down, patted his head, and cried,"
13771,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Poor Captain, what! are you alive, yet?” Rose was surprised that the"
13772,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,stranger and their dog should know one another.
13773,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13774,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,They all entered the house together. A good-looking middle-aged woman
13775,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"was busied in preparing articles of cookery, assisted by her grown-up"
13776,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"daughter. She spoke to the children as they came in, and casting a look"
13777,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"of some surprise on Edward, asked him what his business was."
13778,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13779,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"Edward was some time silent; at length, with a faltering voice, he"
13780,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"cried, “Have you forgot me, mother?”"
13781,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13782,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“Edward! my son Edward!” exclaimed the good woman. And they were
13783,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,instantly locked in each other’s arms.
13784,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13785,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“My brother Edward!” said Molly; and took her turn for an embrace, as"
13786,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,soon as her mother gave her room.
13787,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13788,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“Are you my brother?” said Rose.
13789,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13790,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“That I am,” replied Edward, with another kiss. Little Roger looked hard"
13791,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"at him, but said nothing."
13792,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13793,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"News of Edward’s arrival soon flew across the yard, and in came from the"
13794,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"barn his father, his next brother, Thomas, and the third, William. The"
13795,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"father fell on his neck, and sobbed out his welcome and blessing. Edward"
13796,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,had not hands enough for them all to shake.
13797,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13798,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"An aged, white-headed labourer came in, and held out his shrivelled"
13799,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"hand. Edward gave it a hearty squeeze. “God bless you,” said old Isaac;"
13800,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“this is the best day I have seen this many a year.”
13801,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13802,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“And where have you been this long while?” cried the father. “Eight
13803,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"years and more,” added the mother."
13804,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13805,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,His elder brother took off his knapsack; and Molly drew him a chair.
13806,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"Edward seated himself, and they all gathered round him; the old dog got"
13807,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,within the circle and lay at his feet.
13808,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13809,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“O, how glad I am to see you all again!” were Edward’s first words. “How"
13810,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"well you look, mother! but father grows thinner. As for the rest, I"
13811,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"should have known none of you, unless it had been Thomas and old Isaac.”"
13812,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13813,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“What a sunburnt face you have got!—but you look brave and hearty,”"
13814,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,cried his mother.
13815,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13816,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Ay, mother, I have been enough in the sun, I assure you. From seventeen"
13817,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"to five-and-twenty I have been a wanderer upon the face of the earth,"
13818,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,and I have seen more in that time than most men in the course of their
13819,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,lives.
13820,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13821,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Our young landlord, you know, took such a liking to me at school, that"
13822,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,he would have me go with him on his travels. We went through most of the
13823,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"countries of Europe, and at last to Naples, where my poor master took a"
13824,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,fever and died. I never knew what grief was till then; and I believe the
13825,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,thoughts of leaving me in a strange country went as much to his heart as
13826,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"his illness. An intimate acquaintance of his, a rich young West Indian,"
13827,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"seeing my distress, engaged me to go with him in a voyage he was about"
13828,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,to make to Jamaica. We were too short a time in England before we
13829,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"sailed, for me to come and see you first, but I wrote you a letter from"
13830,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,the Downs.”
13831,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13832,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“We never received it,” said his father."
13833,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13834,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“That was a pity,” returned Edward; “for you must have concluded I was"
13835,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,either dead or had forgotten you. Well—we arrived safe in the West
13836,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"Indies, and there I stayed till I had buried that master, too; for young"
13837,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"men die fast in that country. I was very well treated, but I could never"
13838,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"like the place; and yet Jamaica is a very fine island, and has many good"
13839,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"people in it. But for me, used to see freemen work cheerfully along with"
13840,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,their masters—to behold nothing but droves of black slaves in the
13841,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"fields, toiling in the burning sun, under the constant dread of the lash"
13842,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,of hard-hearted task-masters—it was what I could not bring myself to
13843,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"bear; and though I might have been made an overseer of a plantation, I"
13844,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"chose rather to live in a town, and follow some domestic occupation. I"
13845,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"could soon have got rich there; but I fell into a bad state of health,"
13846,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,and people were dying all round me of the yellow fever; so I collected
13847,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"my little property, and though a war had broken out, I ventured to"
13848,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,embark with it for England.
13849,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13850,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“The ship was taken, and carried into the Havana, and I lost my all and"
13851,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"my liberty besides. However, I had the good fortune to ingratiate myself"
13852,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"with a Spanish merchant whom I had known at Jamaica, and he took me with"
13853,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,him to the continent of South America. I visited great part of this
13854,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"country, once possessed by flourishing and independent nations, but now"
13855,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,groaning under the severe yoke of their haughty conquerers. I saw those
13856,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"famous gold and silver mines, where the poor natives worked naked, for"
13857,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"ever shut out from the light of day, in order that the wealth of their"
13858,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,unhappy land may go to spread luxury and corruption throughout the
13859,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,remotest regions of Europe.
13860,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13861,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“I accompanied my master across the great southern ocean, a voyage of"
13862,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"some months, without the sight of anything but water and sky. We came to"
13863,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"the rich city of Manilla, the capital of the Spanish settlements in"
13864,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"those parts. There I had my liberty restored, along with a handsome"
13865,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,reward for my services. I got thence to China; and from China to the
13866,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"English settlements in the East Indies, where the sight of my"
13867,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"countrymen, and the sounds of my native tongue, made me fancy myself"
13868,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"almost at home again, though still separated by half the globe."
13869,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13870,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Here I saw a delightful country, swarming with industrious inhabitants,"
13871,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"some cultivating the land, others employed in manufactures, but of so"
13872,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"gentle and effeminate a disposition, that they have always fallen under"
13873,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,the yoke of their invaders. Here how was I forced to blush for my
13874,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"countrymen, whose avarice and rapacity so often have laid waste this"
13875,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"fair land, and brought on it all the horrors of famine and desolation! I"
13876,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,have seen human creatures quarrelling like dogs for bare bones thrown
13877,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,upon a dunghill. I have seen fathers selling their families for a little
13878,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"rice, and mothers entreating strangers to take their children for"
13879,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"slaves, that they might not die of hunger. In the midst of such scenes I"
13880,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,saw pomp and luxury of which our country affords no examples.
13881,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13882,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Having remained here a considerable time, I gladly at length set my"
13883,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"face homeward, and joined a company who undertook the long and perilous"
13884,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,journey to Europe over land. We crossed vast tracts both desert and
13885,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"cultivated; sandy plains parched with heat and drought, and infested"
13886,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,with bands of ferocious plunderers. I have seen a well of muddy water
13887,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,more valued than ten camel-loads of treasure; and a few half-naked
13888,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"horsemen strike more terror than a king with all his guards. At length,"
13889,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"after numberless hardships and dangers, we arrived at civilized Europe,"
13890,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"and forgot all we had suffered. As I came nearer my native land, I grew"
13891,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"more and more impatient to reach it; and when I had set foot on it, I"
13892,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,was still more restless till I could see again my beloved home.
13893,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13894,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“Here I am at last—happy in bringing back a sound constitution and a
13895,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,clear conscience. I have also brought enough of the relics of my honest
13896,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"gains to furnish a little farm in the neighbourhood, where I mean to sit"
13897,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,down and spend my days in the midst of those whom I love better than all
13898,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,the world besides.”
13899,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13900,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"When Edward had finished, kisses and kind shakes of the hand were again"
13901,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"repeated, and his mother brought out a large slice of harvest-cake, with"
13902,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"a bottle of her nicest currant-wine, to refresh him after his day’s"
13903,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"march. “You are come,” said his father, “at a lucky time, for this is"
13904,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,our harvest-supper. We shall have some of our neighbours to make merry
13905,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"with us, who will be almost as glad to see you as we are—for you were"
13906,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,always a favourite among them.”
13907,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13908,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,It was not long before the visiters arrived. The young folks ran out to
13909,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"meet them, crying, “Our Edward’s come back—our Edward’s come home! Here"
13910,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,he is—this is he;” and so without ceremony they introduced them.
13911,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13912,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,“Welcome!—welcome!—God bless you!” sounded on all sides. Edward knew all
13913,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"the elderly ones at first sight, but the young people puzzled him for"
13914,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"awhile. At length he recollected this to have been his schoolfellow, and"
13915,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,that his companion in driving plough; and he was not long in finding out
13916,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"his favourite and playfellow Sally, of the next farmhouse, whom he left"
13917,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"a romping girl of fifteen, and now saw a blooming full-formed young"
13918,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,woman of three-and-twenty. He contrived in the evening to get next her:
13919,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"and though she was somewhat reserved at first, they had pretty well"
13920,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,renewed their intimacy before the company broke up.
13921,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,
13922,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"“Health to Edward, and a happy settlement among us!” was the parting"
13923,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"toast. When all were retired, the _Returned Wanderer_ went to rest in"
13924,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,"the very room in which he was born, having first paid fervent thanks to"
13925,THE WANDERER’S RETURN.,Heaven for preserving him to enjoy a blessing the dearest to his heart.

13943,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","Here, numbers of well-dressed persons, and a long train of charity"
13944,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","children, were thronging in at the wide doors of a large handsome"
13945,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","church. There, a smaller number, almost equally gay in dress, were"
13946,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","entering an elegant meetinghouse. Up one alley, a Roman Catholic"
13947,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","congregation was turning into their retired chapel, every one crossing"
13948,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",himself with a finger dipped in holy water as he went in. The opposite
13949,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","side of the street was covered with a train of Quakers, distinguished by"
13950,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","their plain and neat attire and sedate aspect, who walked without"
13951,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","ceremony into a room as plain as themselves, and took their seats, the"
13952,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","men on one side, and the women on the other, in silence. A spacious"
13953,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","building was filled with an overflowing crowd of Methodists, most of"
13954,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","them meanly habited, but decent and serious in demeanour; while a small"
13955,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",society of Baptists in the neighbourhood quietly occupied their humble
13956,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",place of assembly.
13957,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13958,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","Presently, the different services began. The church resounded with the"
13959,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","solemn organ, and with the indistinct murmurs of a large body of people"
13960,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",following the minister in responsive prayers. From the meeting were
13961,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","heard the low psalm, and the single voice of the leader of their"
13962,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","devotions. The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by strains of music,"
13963,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","the tinkling of a small bell, and a perpetual change of service and"
13964,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",ceremonial. A profound silence and unvarying look and posture announced
13965,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",the self-recollection and mental devotion of the Quakers.
13966,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13967,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",Mr. Ambrose led his son Edwin round all these different assemblies as a
13968,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","spectator. Edwin viewed everything with great attention, and was often"
13969,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",impatient to inquire of his father the meaning of what he saw; but Mr.
13970,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",Ambrose would not suffer him to disturb any of the congregation even by
13971,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","a whisper. When they had gone through the whole, Edwin found a greater"
13972,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","number of questions to put to his father, who explained everything put"
13973,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",to him in the best manner he could. At length says Edwin:—
13974,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13975,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","“But why cannot all these people agree to go to the same place, and"
13976,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",worship God the same way?”
13977,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13978,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",“And why should they agree?” replied his father. “Don’t you see that
13979,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","people differ in a hundred other things? Do they all dress alike, and"
13980,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","eat and drink alike, and keep the same hours, and use the same"
13981,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",diversions?”
13982,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13983,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",“Ay—but those are things in which they have a right to do as they
13984,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",please.”
13985,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13986,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","“And they have a right, too, to worship God as they please. It is their"
13987,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","own business, and concerns none but themselves.”"
13988,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13989,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",“But has not God ordered particular ways of worshipping him?”
13990,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13991,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","“He has directed the mind and spirit with which he is to be worshipped,"
13992,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",but not the particular form or manner. That is left for every one to
13993,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","choose, according as suits his temper and opinions. All these people"
13994,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","like their own way best, and why should they leave it for the choice of"
13995,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",another? Religion is one of the things in which _mankind were made to
13996,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",differ_.”
13997,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",
13998,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","The several congregations now began to be dismissed, and the street was"
13999,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","again overspread with persons of all the different sects, going"
14000,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",promiscuously to their respective homes. It chanced that a poor man fell
14001,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","down in the street in a fit of apoplexy, and lay for dead. His wife and"
14002,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",children stood round him crying and lamenting in the bitterest distress.
14003,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","The beholders immediately flocked round, and with looks and expressions"
14004,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","of the warmest compassion, gave their help. A Churchman raised the man"
14005,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","from the ground by lifting him under the arms, while a Dissenter held"
14006,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","his head, and wiped his face with his handkerchief. A Roman Catholic"
14007,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.","lady took out her smelling-bottle, and assiduously applied it to his"
14008,"DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.",nose. A Methodist ran for a doctor. A Quaker supported and comforted the

14048,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ You do very rightly. With industry and sobriety there is no fear
14049,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"of their getting a living, come what may. I wish many gentlemen’s"
14050,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,children had as good a chance.
14051,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14052,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Lord! sir, if they have fortunes ready got for them, what need"
14053,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,they care?
14054,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14055,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ But fortunes are easier to spend than to get; and when they are
14056,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"at the bottom of the purse, what must they do to fill it again?"
14057,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14058,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Nay, that’s true, sir; and we have reason enough to be thankful,"
14059,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"that we are able and willing to work, and have a good landlord to live"
14060,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,under.
14061,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14062,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Good tenants deserve good landlords; and I have been long
14063,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"acquainted with your value. Come, little folks, I have brought something"
14064,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,for you.
14065,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14066,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Takes out cakes._
14067,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14068,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ Why don’t you thank his honour?
14069,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14070,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ I did not think you had a daughter so old as that young woman.
14071,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14072,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ No more I have, sir. She is not my own daughter, though she is as"
14073,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,good as one to me.
14074,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14075,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Some relation, then, I suppose?"
14076,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14077,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ No, sir, none at all."
14078,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14079,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Who is she, then?"
14080,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14081,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ (_whispering_). When she is gone out, I will tell your"
14082,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"honour.—(_aloud._) Go, Fanny, and take some milk to the young calf in"
14083,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,the stable.
14084,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14085,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Exit_ Fanny.
14086,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14087,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ A pretty modest-looking young woman, on my word!"
14088,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14089,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Ay, sir—and as good as she is pretty. You must know, sir, that"
14090,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,this young woman is a stranger from a great way off. She came here quite
14091,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"by accident, and has lived with us above a twelvemonth. I’ll tell your"
14092,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,honour all about it if you choose.
14093,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14094,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Pray do—I am curious to hear it. But first favour me with a
14095,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,draught of your whey.
14096,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14097,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ I beg your pardon, sir, for not offering it. Run, Mary, and fetch"
14098,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,his honour some fresh whey in a clean basin.
14099,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14100,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[Mary _goes_.
14101,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14102,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Now, pray, begin your story."
14103,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14104,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Well, sir—As our John was coming from work one evening, he saw at"
14105,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,some distance on the road a carrier’s wagon overturned. He ran up to
14106,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"help, and found a poor old gentlewoman lying on the back much hurt, and"
14107,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"this girl sitting beside her, crying. My good man, after he had helped"
14108,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"in setting the wagon to rights, went to them, and with a good deal of"
14109,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"difficulty got the gentlewoman into the wagon again, and walked by the"
14110,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,side of it to our house. He called me out and we got something
14111,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,comfortable for her; but she was so ill that she could not bear to be
14112,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"carried farther. So after consulting a while, we took her into the"
14113,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"house, and put her to bed. Her head was sadly hurt, and she seemed to"
14114,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"grow worse instead of better. We got a doctor to her, and did our best"
14115,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"to nurse her, but all would not do, and we soon found she was likely to"
14116,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"die. Poor Fanny, her grand-daughter, never left her day or night; and it"
14117,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"would have gone to your honour’s heart, to have heard the pitiful moan"
14118,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"she made over her. She was the only friend she had in the world, she"
14119,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,said; and what would become of her if she were to lose her? Fanny’s
14120,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"father and mother were both dead, and she was going with her grandmother"
14121,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"into the north, where the old gentlewoman came from, to live cheap, and"
14122,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"to try to find out some relations. Well—to make my story short, in a few"
14123,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,days the poor woman died. There was a little more money about her than
14124,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"would serve to pay her doctor and bury her. Fanny was in sad trouble,"
14125,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,indeed. I thought she would never have left her grandmother’s grave. She
14126,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,cried and wrung her hands most bitterly. But I tire your honour.
14127,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14128,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ O no! I am much interested in your story.
14129,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14130,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ We comforted her as well as we could; but all her cry was, “What"
14131,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,will become of me? Where must I go? Who will take care of me?” So after
14132,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"a while, said I to John, “Poor creature! my heart grieves for her."
14133,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,Perhaps she would like to stay with us—though she seems to have been
14134,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"brought up in a way of living different from ours, too; but what can she"
14135,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"do, left to herself in the wide world!” So my husband agreed that I"
14136,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"should ask her. When I mentioned it to her, poor thing! how her"
14137,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"countenance altered! “O,” said she, “I wish for nothing so much as to"
14138,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"stay and live with you! I am afraid I can do but little to serve you,"
14139,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,but indeed I will learn to do my best.” Said I: “Do no more than you
14140,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,like; you are welcome to stay and partake with us as long as you
14141,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"please.” Well, sir! she stayed with us; and set about learning to do all"
14142,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"kind of our work with such good-will, and so handily, that she soon"
14143,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"became my best helper. And she is so sweet-tempered, and so fond of us"
14144,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"and the children, that I love her as well as if she was my own child."
14145,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"She has been well brought up, I am sure. She can read, and write, and"
14146,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"work with her needle, a great deal better than we can, and when work is"
14147,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"over, she teaches the children. Then she is extraordinarily"
14148,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"well-behaved, so as to be admired by all that see her.—So your honour"
14149,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,has now the story of our Fanny.
14150,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14151,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ I thank you heartily for it, my good Betty! It does much credit"
14152,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"both to you and Fanny. But pray, what is her surname?"
14153,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14154,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ It is—let me see—I think it is Welford.
14155,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14156,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Welford! that is a name I am acquainted with. I should be glad
14157,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,to talk with her a little.
14158,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14159,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ I will call her in then.
14160,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14161,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Enter_ Fanny.
14162,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14163,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Come hither, young woman; I have heard your story, and been much"
14164,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"interested by it. You are an orphan, I find."
14165,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14166,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fanny._ Yes, sir; a poor orphan."
14167,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14168,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Your name is Welford?
14169,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14170,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ It is, sir."
14171,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14172,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Where did your parents live?
14173,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14174,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ In London, sir; but they died when I was very young, and I went"
14175,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,to my grandmother’s in Surrey.
14176,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14177,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Was she your father’s mother? You will excuse my questions. I do
14178,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,not ask from idle curiosity.
14179,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14180,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ She was, sir; and had been long a widow."
14181,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14182,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Do you know what her maiden name was?
14183,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14184,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ It was Borrowdale, sir."
14185,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14186,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Borrowdale!—And pray, whither were you going when the"
14187,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,unfortunate accident happened?
14188,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14189,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ To Kendal in Westmoreland, sir, near which my grandmother was"
14190,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,born.
14191,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14192,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ Ah! ‘tis the very same—every circumstance corresponds! My dear
14193,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"Fanny (_taking her hand_), you have found a relation when you little"
14194,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"thought of it. I am your kinsman. My mother was a Borrowdale, of"
14195,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"Westmoreland, and half-sister to your grandmother. I have heard of all"
14196,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"your parentage; and I remember the death of your poor father, who was a"
14197,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"very honest ingenious artist: and of your mother soon after, of a broken"
14198,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"heart. I could never discover what family they left, nor what was become"
14199,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,of my kinswoman. But I rejoice I have found you out in this
14200,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,extraordinary manner. You must come and live with me. My wife and
14201,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,daughters will be very glad to receive one whose conduct has done her so
14202,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,much credit.
14203,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14204,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ I am much obliged to you, sir, for your kindness; but I am too"
14205,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,mean a person to live as a relation in a family like yours.
14206,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14207,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Land._ O no! you will not find us of that sort who despise worthy
14208,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,people for being low in the world; and your language and actions show
14209,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,that you have been well brought up.
14210,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14211,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ My poor grandmother, sir, was so kind as to give me all the"
14212,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,education in her power; and if I have not somewhat benefited by her
14213,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"example and instructions, it must have been my own fault."
14214,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14215,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ You speak very well, and I feel more attached to you, the more I"
14216,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"hear you.—Well, you must prepare to come home with me. I will take care"
14217,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,to make proper acknowledgments to the good people here who have been so
14218,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,kind to you.
14219,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14220,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ My dear Fanny, I am heartily glad of your good fortune, but we"
14221,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,shall all be sorry to part with you.
14222,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14223,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ I am sure, my dear friend and mistress, I shall be sorry too. You"
14224,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"received me when I had no other friend in the world, and you treated me"
14225,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,like your own child. I can never forget what I owe you.
14226,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14227,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Enter_ John, _and his eldest son_ Thomas."
14228,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14229,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_John._ Is your honour here?
14230,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14231,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Yes, John; and I have found something worth coming for."
14232,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14233,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ What is that, sir?"
14234,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14235,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ A relation, John. This young woman whom you have so kindly"
14236,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"entertained, is my kinswoman."
14237,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14238,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_John._ What—our Fanny?
14239,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14240,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Thomas._ Fanny!
14241,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14242,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Yes, indeed. And, after thanking you for your kindness to her"
14243,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"and her poor grandmother, I mean to take her home for a companion to my"
14244,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,wife and daughters.
14245,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14246,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ This is wonderful news, indeed! Well, Fanny, I am very glad you"
14247,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,have got such a home to go to—you are worthy of it—but we shall miss you
14248,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,much here.
14249,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14250,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ So I have been telling her.
14251,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14252,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Thom._ (_aside to_ Fanny). What, will you leave us, Fanny? Must we"
14253,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,part?
14254,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14255,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ (_aside to him_). What can I do, Thomas?"
14256,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14257,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ There seems some unwillingness to part, I see, on more sides"
14258,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,than one.
14259,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14260,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Indeed, sir, I believe there is. We have lived very happily"
14261,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,together.
14262,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14263,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Thom._ (_aside to Fanny_). I see we must part with you, but I"
14264,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,hope—Surely you won’t quite forget us?
14265,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14266,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ (_to him_). You distress me, Thomas. Forget you! O no!"
14267,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14268,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Come, I see there is something between the young folks that"
14269,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"ought to be spoken about plainly. Do you explain it, Betty."
14270,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14271,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Bet._ Why, your honour knows, we could not tell that Fanny was your"
14272,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"relation. So, as my son Thomas and she seemed to take a liking to one"
14273,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"another, and she was such a clever girl, we did not object to their"
14274,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"thinking about making a match of it, as soon as he should be settled in"
14275,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,a farm.
14276,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14277,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_John._ But that must be over now.
14278,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14279,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Thom._ Why so, father?"
14280,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14281,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_John._ Why; you can’t think of his honour’s kinswoman.
14282,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14283,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Come, Fanny, do you decide this affair."
14284,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14285,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ Sir, Thomas offered me his service when he thought me a poor"
14286,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"friendless girl, and I might think myself favoured by his notice. He"
14287,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"gained my good will, which no change of circumstances can make me"
14288,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"withdraw. It is my determination to join my lot with his, be it what it"
14289,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,may.
14290,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14291,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Thom._ My dearest Fanny!
14292,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14293,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Taking her hand._
14294,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14295,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ You act nobly, my dear girl, and make me proud of my relation."
14296,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"You shall have my free consent, and something handsome into the bargain."
14297,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14298,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ Heaven bless your honour! I know it would have been a
14299,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,heartbreaking to my poor boy to have parted with her. Dear Fanny!
14300,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14301,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Kisses her._
14302,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14303,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ I have a farm just now vacant. Thomas shall take it, and Fanny’s"
14304,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,portion shall stock it for him.
14305,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14306,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Thom._ I humbly thank your honour.
14307,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14308,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ I thank you too, sir, for us all."
14309,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14310,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ Sir, since you have been so indulgent in this matter, give me"
14311,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,leave to request you to be satisfied with my paying my duty to the
14312,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"ladies, without going to live in a way so different from what I have"
14313,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"been used to, and must live in hereafter. I think I can be nowhere"
14314,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,better than with my friends and future parents here.
14315,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14316,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Your request, Fanny, has so much propriety and good sense in it,"
14317,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"that I cannot refuse it. However, you must suffer us to improve our"
14318,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,acquaintance. I assure you it will give me particular pleasure.
14319,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14320,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ Sir, you will always command my most grateful obedience."
14321,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14322,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Land._ Well—let Thomas bring you to my house this afternoon, and I will"
14323,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"introduce you to your relations, and we will talk over matters."
14324,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"Farewell, my dear! Nay, I must have a kiss."
14325,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14326,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_Fan._ I will wait on you, sir."
14327,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14328,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,[_Exit Landlord._
14329,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14330,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ My dear Fanny—daughter I may now call you—you cannot think how
14331,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,much I feel obliged to you.
14332,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14333,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Thom._ But who is so much obliged as I am?
14334,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14335,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Fan._ Do you not all deserve everything from me?
14336,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14337,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,"_John._ Well, who could have thought when I went to help up the wagon,"
14338,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,that it would have brought so much good luck to us?
14339,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14340,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Bet._ A good deed is never lost they say.
14341,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,
14342,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,_Fan._ It shall be the business of my life to prove that this has not
14343,THE LANDLORD’S VISIT.—A DRAMA.,been lost.

14349,ON EMBLEMS.,
14350,ON EMBLEMS.,
14351,ON EMBLEMS.,"“Pray, papa,” said Cecilia, “what is an _emblem_? I have met with the"
14352,ON EMBLEMS.,"word in my lesson to-day, and I do not quite understand it.”"
14353,ON EMBLEMS.,
14354,ON EMBLEMS.,"“An emblem, my dear,” replied he, “is a visible image of an invisible"
14355,ON EMBLEMS.,thing.”
14356,ON EMBLEMS.,
14357,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cecilia._ A visible image of—I can hardly comprehend—
14358,ON EMBLEMS.,
14359,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Well, I will explain it more at length. There are certain notions"
14360,ON EMBLEMS.,that we form in our minds without the help of our eyes or any of our
14361,ON EMBLEMS.,"senses. Thus, Virtue, Vice, Honour, Disgrace, Time, Death, and the like,"
14362,ON EMBLEMS.,"are not sensible objects, but ideas of the understanding."
14363,ON EMBLEMS.,
14364,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ Yes—We cannot feel them or see them, but we can think about them."
14365,ON EMBLEMS.,
14366,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ True. Now it sometimes happens that we wish to represent one of
14367,ON EMBLEMS.,"these in a visible form; that is, to offer something to the sight that"
14368,ON EMBLEMS.,shall raise a similar notion in the minds of the beholders. In order to
14369,ON EMBLEMS.,"do this, we must take some action or circumstance belonging to it,"
14370,ON EMBLEMS.,"capable of being expressed by painting or sculpture, and this is called"
14371,ON EMBLEMS.,a _type_ or _emblem_.
14372,ON EMBLEMS.,
14373,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ But how can this be done?
14374,ON EMBLEMS.,
14375,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ I will tell you by an example. You know the sessions-house, where"
14376,ON EMBLEMS.,trials are held. It would be easy to write over the door in order to
14377,ON EMBLEMS.,"distinguish it, “This is the sessions-house;” but it is a more ingenious"
14378,ON EMBLEMS.,"and elegant way of pointing it out, to place upon the building a figure"
14379,ON EMBLEMS.,"representing the purpose for which it was erected, namely, to distribute"
14380,ON EMBLEMS.,"_justice_. For this end the notion of justice is to be _personified_,"
14381,ON EMBLEMS.,"that is, changed from an idea of the understanding into one of the"
14382,ON EMBLEMS.,"sight. A human figure is therefore made, distinguished by tokens which"
14383,ON EMBLEMS.,bear a relation to the character of that virtue. Justice carefully
14384,ON EMBLEMS.,_weighs_ both sides of a cause; she is therefore represented as holding
14385,ON EMBLEMS.,a _pair of scales_. It is her office to _punish_ crimes; she therefore
14386,ON EMBLEMS.,"bears a _sword_. This is then an _emblematical figure_, and the sword"
14387,ON EMBLEMS.,and scales are _emblems_.
14388,ON EMBLEMS.,
14389,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I understand this very well. But why is she blindfolded?
14390,ON EMBLEMS.,
14391,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ To denote her impartiality—that she decides only from the merits
14392,ON EMBLEMS.,"of the case, and not from a view of the parties."
14393,ON EMBLEMS.,
14394,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ How can she weigh anything, though, when her eyes are blinded?"
14395,ON EMBLEMS.,
14396,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Well objected. These are two inconsistent emblems; each proper in
14397,ON EMBLEMS.,"itself, but when used together, making a contradictory action. An artist"
14398,ON EMBLEMS.,of judgment will therefore drop one of them; and accordingly the best
14399,ON EMBLEMS.,"modern figures of Justice have the balance and sword, without the"
14400,ON EMBLEMS.,bandage over the eyes.
14401,ON EMBLEMS.,
14402,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ Is there not the same fault in making Cupid blindfolded, and yet"
14403,ON EMBLEMS.,putting a bow and arrow into his hands?
14404,ON EMBLEMS.,
14405,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ There is. It is a gross absurdity, and not countenanced by the"
14406,ON EMBLEMS.,"ancient descriptions of Cupid, who is represented as the surest of all"
14407,ON EMBLEMS.,archers.
14408,ON EMBLEMS.,
14409,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I have a figure of _Death_ in my fable-book. I suppose that is
14410,ON EMBLEMS.,emblematical?
14411,ON EMBLEMS.,
14412,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Certainly, or you could not know that it meant Death. How is it"
14413,ON EMBLEMS.,represented?
14414,ON EMBLEMS.,
14415,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ He is nothing but bones, and he holds a scythe in one hand, and"
14416,ON EMBLEMS.,an hour-glass in the other.
14417,ON EMBLEMS.,
14418,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Well—how do you interpret these emblems?
14419,ON EMBLEMS.,
14420,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I suppose he is all bones, because nothing but bones are left"
14421,ON EMBLEMS.,after a dead body has lain long in the grave.
14422,ON EMBLEMS.,
14423,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ True. This, however, is not so properly an emblem, as the real and"
14424,ON EMBLEMS.,visible effect of death. But the scythe?
14425,ON EMBLEMS.,
14426,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Is not that because death mows down everything?
14427,ON EMBLEMS.,
14428,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ It is. No instrument could so properly represent the wide-wasting
14429,ON EMBLEMS.,"sway of death, which sweeps down the race of animals like flowers"
14430,ON EMBLEMS.,falling under the hands of the mower. It is a simile used in the
14431,ON EMBLEMS.,Scriptures.
14432,ON EMBLEMS.,
14433,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ The hour-glass, I suppose, is to show people their time is come."
14434,ON EMBLEMS.,
14435,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Right. In the hour-glass that Death holds, all the sand is run out"
14436,ON EMBLEMS.,from the upper to the lower part. Have you never observed upon a
14437,ON EMBLEMS.,"monument an old figure, with wings, and a scythe, and with his head bald"
14438,ON EMBLEMS.,all but a single lock before?
14439,ON EMBLEMS.,
14440,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ O yes;—and I have been told it is _Time_.
14441,ON EMBLEMS.,
14442,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Well—and what do you make of it? Why is he old?
14443,ON EMBLEMS.,
14444,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ O! because he has lasted a long while.
14445,ON EMBLEMS.,
14446,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ And why has he wings?
14447,ON EMBLEMS.,
14448,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ Because Time is swift, and flies away."
14449,ON EMBLEMS.,
14450,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ What does his scythe mean?
14451,ON EMBLEMS.,
14452,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I suppose it is because he destroys and cuts down everything,"
14453,ON EMBLEMS.,like Death.
14454,ON EMBLEMS.,
14455,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ True. I think, however, a weapon rather slower in operation, as a"
14456,ON EMBLEMS.,"pick-axe, would have been more suitable to the gradual action of time."
14457,ON EMBLEMS.,But what is his single lock of hair for?
14458,ON EMBLEMS.,
14459,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I have been thinking, and cannot make it out."
14460,ON EMBLEMS.,
14461,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ I thought that would puzzle you. It relates to time as giving
14462,ON EMBLEMS.,_opportunity_ for doing anything. It is to be seized as it presents
14463,ON EMBLEMS.,"itself, or it will escape, and cannot be recovered. Thus the proverb"
14464,ON EMBLEMS.,"says, “Take Time by the forelock.” Well—now you understand what emblems"
14465,ON EMBLEMS.,are.
14466,ON EMBLEMS.,
14467,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ Yes, I think I do. I suppose the painted sugar-loaves over the"
14468,ON EMBLEMS.,"grocer’s shop, and the mortar over the apothecary’s, are emblems, too?"
14469,ON EMBLEMS.,
14470,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Not so properly. They are only the pictures of things which are
14471,ON EMBLEMS.,"themselves the objects of sight, as the real sugar-loaf in the shop of"
14472,ON EMBLEMS.,"the grocer, and the real mortar in that of the apothecary. However, an"
14473,ON EMBLEMS.,implement belonging to a particular rank or profession is commonly used
14474,ON EMBLEMS.,as an emblem to point out the man exercising that rank or profession.
14475,ON EMBLEMS.,"Thus, a crown is considered as an emblem of a king; a sword, or spear,"
14476,ON EMBLEMS.,"of a soldier; an anchor, of a sailor; and the like."
14477,ON EMBLEMS.,
14478,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I remember Captain Heartwell, when he came to see us, had the"
14479,ON EMBLEMS.,figure of an anchor on all his buttons.
14480,ON EMBLEMS.,
14481,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ He had. That was the emblem or badge of his belonging to the navy.
14482,ON EMBLEMS.,
14483,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ But you told me that an emblem was a visible sign of an invisible
14484,ON EMBLEMS.,thing; yet a sea-captain is not an invisible thing.
14485,ON EMBLEMS.,
14486,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ He is not invisible as a man, but his profession is invisible."
14487,ON EMBLEMS.,
14488,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I do not well understand that.
14489,ON EMBLEMS.,
14490,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Profession is a _quality_, belonging equally to a number of"
14491,ON EMBLEMS.,"individuals, however different they may be in external form and"
14492,ON EMBLEMS.,appearance. It may be added or taken away without any visible change.
14493,ON EMBLEMS.,"Thus, if Captain Heartwell were to give up his commission, he would"
14494,ON EMBLEMS.,"appear to you the same man as before. It is plain, therefore, that what"
14495,ON EMBLEMS.,"in that case he had lost, namely, his profession, was a thing invisible."
14496,ON EMBLEMS.,It is one of those ideas of the understanding which I before mentioned
14497,ON EMBLEMS.,to you as different from a sensible idea.
14498,ON EMBLEMS.,
14499,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I comprehend it now.
14500,ON EMBLEMS.,
14501,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ I have got here a few emblematical pictures. Suppose you try
14502,ON EMBLEMS.,whether you can find out their meaning.
14503,ON EMBLEMS.,
14504,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ O yes—I shall like that very well.
14505,ON EMBLEMS.,
14506,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Here is a man standing on the summit of a steep cliff, and going"
14507,ON EMBLEMS.,to ascend a ladder which he has planted against a cloud.
14508,ON EMBLEMS.,
14509,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ Let me see!—that must be _Ambition_, I think."
14510,ON EMBLEMS.,
14511,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ How do you explain it?
14512,ON EMBLEMS.,
14513,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ He is got very high already, but he wants to be still higher; so"
14514,ON EMBLEMS.,"he ventures up the ladder, though it is only supported by a cloud, and"
14515,ON EMBLEMS.,hangs over a precipice.
14516,ON EMBLEMS.,
14517,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Very right. Here is now another man, hood-winked, who is crossing"
14518,ON EMBLEMS.,a raging torrent upon stepping-stones.
14519,ON EMBLEMS.,
14520,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Then he will certainly fall in. I suppose he is one that runs
14521,ON EMBLEMS.,into danger without considering whither he is going?
14522,ON EMBLEMS.,
14523,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Yes; and you may call him _Fool-hardiness_. Do you see this hand
14524,ON EMBLEMS.,"coming out of a black cloud, and putting an extinguisher upon a lamp?"
14525,ON EMBLEMS.,
14526,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I do. If that lamp be the lamp of life, the hand that"
14527,ON EMBLEMS.,extinguishes it must be _Death_.
14528,ON EMBLEMS.,
14529,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Very just. Here is an old, half-ruined building, supported by"
14530,ON EMBLEMS.,props; and the figure of Time is sawing through one of the props.
14531,ON EMBLEMS.,
14532,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ That must be _Old Age_, surely."
14533,ON EMBLEMS.,
14534,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ It is. The next is a man leaning upon a breaking crutch.
14535,ON EMBLEMS.,
14536,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I don’t well know what to make of that.
14537,ON EMBLEMS.,
14538,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ It is intended for _Instability_; however, it might also stand for"
14539,ON EMBLEMS.,_False Confidence_. Here is a man poring over a sundial with a candle in
14540,ON EMBLEMS.,his hand.
14541,ON EMBLEMS.,
14542,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ I am at a loss for that, too."
14543,ON EMBLEMS.,
14544,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ Consider—a sundial is only made to tell the hour by the light of
14545,ON EMBLEMS.,the sun.
14546,ON EMBLEMS.,
14547,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Then this man must know nothing about it.
14548,ON EMBLEMS.,
14549,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ True; and his name is therefore _Ignorance_. Here is a
14550,ON EMBLEMS.,"walking-stick, the lower part of which is set in the water, and it"
14551,ON EMBLEMS.,appears crooked. What does that denote?
14552,ON EMBLEMS.,
14553,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Is the stick really crooked?
14554,ON EMBLEMS.,
14555,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ No; but it is the property of water to give that appearance.
14556,ON EMBLEMS.,
14557,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Then it must signify _Deception_.
14558,ON EMBLEMS.,
14559,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ It does. I dare say you will at once know this fellow who is
14560,ON EMBLEMS.,"running as fast as his legs will carry him, and looking back at his"
14561,ON EMBLEMS.,shadow.
14562,ON EMBLEMS.,
14563,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ He must be _Fear_ or _Terror_, I fancy."
14564,ON EMBLEMS.,
14565,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Yes; you may call him which you please. But who is this sower,"
14566,ON EMBLEMS.,that scatters seeds in the ground?
14567,ON EMBLEMS.,
14568,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ Let me consider. I think there is a parable in the Bible about
14569,ON EMBLEMS.,"seed sown, and it therefore signifies something like _Instruction_."
14570,ON EMBLEMS.,
14571,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ True; but it may also represent _Hope_, for no one sows without"
14572,ON EMBLEMS.,hoping to reap the fruit. What do you think of this candle held before a
14573,ON EMBLEMS.,"mirror, in which its figure is exactly reflected?"
14574,ON EMBLEMS.,
14575,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I do not know what it means.
14576,ON EMBLEMS.,
14577,ON EMBLEMS.,_Pa._ It represents _Truth_; the essence of which consists in the
14578,ON EMBLEMS.,fidelity with which objects are received and reflected back by our
14579,ON EMBLEMS.,"minds. The object is here a luminous one, to show the clearness and"
14580,ON EMBLEMS.,"brightness of Truth. Here is next an upright column, the perfect"
14581,ON EMBLEMS.,"straightness of which is shown by a plumb-line hanging from its summit,"
14582,ON EMBLEMS.,and exactly parallel to the side of the column.
14583,ON EMBLEMS.,
14584,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ I suppose that must represent _Uprightness_.
14585,ON EMBLEMS.,
14586,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Yes—or in other words, _Rectitude_. The strength and stability of"
14587,ON EMBLEMS.,the pillar alone denote the security produced by this virtue. You see
14588,ON EMBLEMS.,here a woman disentangling and reeling off a very perplexed skein of
14589,ON EMBLEMS.,thread.
14590,ON EMBLEMS.,
14591,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ She must have a great deal of patience.
14592,ON EMBLEMS.,
14593,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ True. She is _Patience_ herself. The brooding hen, sitting beside"
14594,ON EMBLEMS.,"her, is another emblem of the same quality that aids the interpretation."
14595,ON EMBLEMS.,"Who do you think this pleasing female is, that looks with such kindness"
14596,ON EMBLEMS.,upon the drooping plant she is watering?
14597,ON EMBLEMS.,
14598,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ That must be _Charity_, I believe."
14599,ON EMBLEMS.,
14600,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ It is; or you may call her _Benignity_, which is nearly the same"
14601,ON EMBLEMS.,"thing. Here is a lady sitting demurely, with one finger on her lip,"
14602,ON EMBLEMS.,while she holds a bridle in her other hand.
14603,ON EMBLEMS.,
14604,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ The finger on the lip, I suppose, denotes Silence. The bridle"
14605,ON EMBLEMS.,must mean confinement. I should almost fancy her to be a schoolmistress.
14606,ON EMBLEMS.,
14607,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Ha! ha! I hope, indeed, many schoolmistresses are endued with her"
14608,ON EMBLEMS.,"spirit, for she is _Prudence_ or _Discretion_. Well—we are now got to"
14609,ON EMBLEMS.,"the end of our pictures, and upon the whole you have interpreted them"
14610,ON EMBLEMS.,very prettily.
14611,ON EMBLEMS.,
14612,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ But I have one question to ask you, papa. In these pictures and"
14613,ON EMBLEMS.,"others that I have seen of the same sort, almost all the _good_"
14614,ON EMBLEMS.,qualities are represented in the form of _women_. What is the reason of
14615,ON EMBLEMS.,that?
14616,ON EMBLEMS.,
14617,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ It is certainly a compliment, my dear, either to your sex’s person"
14618,ON EMBLEMS.,or mind. The inventor either chose the figure of a female to clothe each
14619,ON EMBLEMS.,"agreeable quality in, because he thought that the most agreeable form,"
14620,ON EMBLEMS.,and therefore best suited it; or he meant to imply that the female
14621,ON EMBLEMS.,character is really the most virtuous and amiable. I rather believe that
14622,ON EMBLEMS.,"the first was his intention, but I shall not object to your taking it in"
14623,ON EMBLEMS.,the light of the second.
14624,ON EMBLEMS.,
14625,ON EMBLEMS.,_Cec._ But is it true—is it true?
14626,ON EMBLEMS.,
14627,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Pa._ Why, I can give you very good authority for the preference of the"
14628,ON EMBLEMS.,"female sex, in a moral view. One Ledyard, a great traveller, who had"
14629,ON EMBLEMS.,"walked through almost all the countries of Europe, and at last died in"
14630,ON EMBLEMS.,"an expedition to explore the internal parts of Africa, gave a most"
14631,ON EMBLEMS.,decisive and pleasing testimony in favour of the superior character of
14632,ON EMBLEMS.,"women, whether savage or civilized. I was so much pleased with it, that"
14633,ON EMBLEMS.,"I put great part of it into verse; and if it will not make you vain, I"
14634,ON EMBLEMS.,will give you a copy of my lines.
14635,ON EMBLEMS.,
14636,ON EMBLEMS.,"_Cec._ O, pray, do!"
14637,ON EMBLEMS.,

14690,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14691,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14692,GENEROUS REVENGE.,At the period when the republic of Genoa was divided between the
14693,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"factions of the nobles and the people, Uberto, a man of low origin, but"
14694,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"of an elevated mind and superior talents, and enriched by commerce,"
14695,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"having raised himself to be the head of a popular party, maintained for"
14696,GENEROUS REVENGE.,a considerable time a democratic form of government.
14697,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14698,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"The nobles, at length, uniting all their efforts, succeeded in"
14699,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"subverting this state of things, and regained their former supremacy."
14700,GENEROUS REVENGE.,They used their victory with considerable rigour; and in particular
14701,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"having imprisoned Uberto, proceeded against him as a traitor, and"
14702,GENEROUS REVENGE.,thought they displayed sufficient lenity in passing a sentence upon him
14703,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"of perpetual banishment, and the confiscation of all his property."
14704,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"Adorno, who was then possessed of the first magistracy, a man haughty in"
14705,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"temper, and proud of ancient nobility, though otherwise not void of"
14706,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"generous sentiments, in pronouncing this sentence on Uberto, aggravated"
14707,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"its severity by the insolent terms in which he conveyed it. “You,” said"
14708,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"he,—“you, the son of a base mechanic, who have dared to trample upon the"
14709,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"nobles of Genoa—you, by their clemency, are only doomed to shrink again"
14710,GENEROUS REVENGE.,into the nothingness whence you sprung.”
14711,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14712,GENEROUS REVENGE.,Uberto received his condemnation with respectful submission to the
14713,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"court; yet stung by the manner in which it was expressed, he could not"
14714,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"forbear saying to Adorno, that “perhaps he might hereafter find cause to"
14715,GENEROUS REVENGE.,repent the language he had used to a man capable of sentiments as
14716,GENEROUS REVENGE.,elevated as his own.” He then made his obeisance and retired; and after
14717,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"taking leave of his friends, embarked in a vessel bound for Naples, and"
14718,GENEROUS REVENGE.,quitted his native country without a tear.
14719,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14720,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"He collected some debts due to him in the Neapolitan dominions, and with"
14721,GENEROUS REVENGE.,the wreck of his fortune went to settle on one of the islands in the
14722,GENEROUS REVENGE.,Archipelago belonging to the state of Venice. Here his industry and
14723,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"capacity in mercantile pursuits raised him, in a course of years, to"
14724,GENEROUS REVENGE.,greater wealth than he had possessed in his most prosperous days at
14725,GENEROUS REVENGE.,Genoa; and his reputation for honour and generosity equalled his
14726,GENEROUS REVENGE.,fortune.
14727,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14728,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"Among other places which he frequently visited as a merchant, was the"
14729,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"city of Tunis, at that time in friendship with the Venetians, though"
14730,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"hostile to most of the other Italian states, and especially to Genoa. As"
14731,GENEROUS REVENGE.,Uberto was on a visit to one of the first men of that place at his
14732,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"country-house, he saw a young Christian slave at work in irons, whose"
14733,GENEROUS REVENGE.,appearance excited his attention. The youth seemed oppressed with
14734,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"labour, to which his delicate frame had not been accustomed, and while"
14735,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"he leaned at intervals upon the instrument with which he was working, a"
14736,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"sigh burst from his full heart, and a tear stole down his cheek. Uberto"
14737,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"eyed him with tender compassion, and addressed him in Italian. The youth"
14738,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"eagerly caught the sounds of his native tongue, and replying to his"
14739,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"inquiries, informed him he was a Genoese. “And what is your name, young"
14740,GENEROUS REVENGE.,man?” said Uberto. “You need not be afraid of confessing to _me_ your
14741,GENEROUS REVENGE.,birth and condition.”
14742,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14743,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"“Alas!” he answered, “I fear my captors already suspect enough to demand"
14744,GENEROUS REVENGE.,a large ransom. My father is indeed one of the first men in Genoa. His
14745,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"name is Adorno, and I am his only son.”—“Adorno!” Uberto checked himself"
14746,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"from uttering more aloud, but to himself he cried, “Thank Heaven! then I"
14747,GENEROUS REVENGE.,shall be nobly revenged.”
14748,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14749,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"He took leave of the youth, and immediately went to inquire after the"
14750,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"corsair captain who claimed a right in young Adorno, and having found"
14751,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"him, demanded the price of his ransom. He learned that he was considered"
14752,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"as a captive of value, and that less than two thousand crowns would not"
14753,GENEROUS REVENGE.,be accepted. Uberto paid the sum; and causing his servant to follow him
14754,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"with a horse and a complete suit of handsome apparel, he returned to the"
14755,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"youth, who was working as before, and told him he was free. With his own"
14756,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"hands he took off his fetters, and helped him to change his dress, and"
14757,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"mount on horseback. The youth was tempted to think it all a dream, and"
14758,GENEROUS REVENGE.,the flutter of emotion almost deprived him of the power of returning
14759,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"thanks to his generous benefactor. He was soon, however, convinced of"
14760,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"the reality of his good fortune, by sharing the lodging and table of"
14761,GENEROUS REVENGE.,Uberto.
14762,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14763,GENEROUS REVENGE.,After a stay of some days at Tunis to despatch the remainder of his
14764,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"business, Uberto departed homeward accompanied by young Adorno, who by"
14765,GENEROUS REVENGE.,his pleasing manners had highly ingratiated himself with him. Uberto
14766,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"kept him some time at his house, treating him with all the respect and"
14767,GENEROUS REVENGE.,affection he could have shown for the son of his dearest friend. At
14768,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"length, having a safe opportunity of sending him to Genoa, he gave him a"
14769,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"faithful servant for a conductor, fitted him out with every convenience,"
14770,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"slipped a purse of gold into one hand, and a letter into the other, and"
14771,GENEROUS REVENGE.,thus addressed him:—
14772,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14773,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"“My dear youth, I could with much pleasure detain you longer in my"
14774,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"humble mansion, but I feel your impatience to revisit your friends, and"
14775,GENEROUS REVENGE.,I am sensible that it would be cruelty to deprive them longer than
14776,GENEROUS REVENGE.,necessary of the joy they will receive in recovering you. Deign to
14777,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"accept this provision for your voyage, and deliver this letter to your"
14778,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"father. _He_ probably may recollect something of me, though you are too"
14779,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"young to do so. Farewell; I shall not soon forget you, and I hope you"
14780,GENEROUS REVENGE.,will not forget me.” Adorno poured out the effusions of a grateful and
14781,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"affectionate heart, and they parted with mutual tears and embraces."
14782,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14783,GENEROUS REVENGE.,The young man had a prosperous voyage home; and the transport with which
14784,GENEROUS REVENGE.,he was again beheld by his almost heart-broken parents may more easily
14785,GENEROUS REVENGE.,be conceived than described. After learning that he had been a captive
14786,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"in Tunis, (for it was supposed that the ship in which he sailed had"
14787,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"foundered at sea,) “And to whom,” said old Adorno, “am I indebted for"
14788,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"the inestimable benefit of restoring you to my arms?”—“This letter,”"
14789,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"said his son, “will inform you.” He opened it, and read as follows:—"
14790,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14791,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"“That son of a vile mechanic, who told you that one day you might"
14792,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"repent the scorn with which you treated him, has the satisfaction"
14793,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"of seeing his prediction accomplished. For know, proud noble! that"
14794,GENEROUS REVENGE.,the deliverer of your only son from slavery is
14795,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14796,GENEROUS REVENGE.,“_The banished_ UBERTO.”
14797,GENEROUS REVENGE.,
14798,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"Adorno dropped the letter and covered his face with his hand, while his"
14799,GENEROUS REVENGE.,son was displaying in the warmest language of gratitude the virtues of
14800,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"Uberto, and the truly paternal kindness he had experienced from him. As"
14801,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"the debt could not be cancelled, Adorno resolved if possible to repay"
14802,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"it. He made such powerful intercessions with the other nobles, that the"
14803,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"sentence pronounced on Uberto was reversed, and full permission given"
14804,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"him to return to Genoa. In apprizing him of this event, Adorno expressed"
14805,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"his sense of the obligations he lay under to him, acknowledged the"
14806,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"genuine nobleness of his character, and requested his friendship. Uberto"
14807,GENEROUS REVENGE.,"returned to his country, and closed his days in peace, with the"
14808,GENEROUS REVENGE.,universal esteem of his fellow-citizens.

14814,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14815,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14816,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"William was one day reading in a book of travels to his father, when he"
14817,THE POWER OF HABIT.,came to the following relation:—
14818,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14819,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“The Andes in South America are the highest ridge of mountains in the
14820,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"known world. There is a road over them, on which, about halfway between"
14821,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"the summit and the foot, is a house of entertainment, where it is common"
14822,THE POWER OF HABIT.,for travellers in their ascent and descent to meet. The difference of
14823,THE POWER OF HABIT.,their feelings upon the same spot is very remarkable. Those who are
14824,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"descending the mountain are melting with heat, so that they can scarcely"
14825,THE POWER OF HABIT.,bear any clothes upon them; while those who are ascending shiver with
14826,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"cold, and wrap themselves up in the warmest garments they have.”"
14827,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14828,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“How strange this is!” cried William; “What can be the reason of it?”
14829,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14830,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“It is,” replied his father, “a striking instance of the _power of"
14831,THE POWER OF HABIT.,habit_ over the body. The cold is so intense on the top of these
14832,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"mountains, that it is as much as travellers can do to keep themselves"
14833,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"from being frozen to death. Their bodies, therefore, become so"
14834,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"habituated to the sensation of cold, that every diminution of it as they"
14835,THE POWER OF HABIT.,descend seems to them a degree of actual heat; and when they are got
14836,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"halfway down, they feel as if they were quite in a sultry climate. On"
14837,THE POWER OF HABIT.,the other hand the valleys at the foot of the mountains are so
14838,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"excessively hot, that the body becomes relaxed, and sensible to the"
14839,THE POWER OF HABIT.,slightest degree of cold; so that when a traveller ascends from them
14840,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"toward the hills, the middle regions appear quite inclement from their"
14841,THE POWER OF HABIT.,coldness.”
14842,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14843,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“And does the same thing,” rejoined William, “always happen in crossing"
14844,THE POWER OF HABIT.,high mountains?”
14845,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14846,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“It does,” returned his father, “in a degree proportioned to their"
14847,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"height, and the time taken in crossing them. Indeed, a short time is"
14848,THE POWER OF HABIT.,sufficient to produce similar effects. Let one boy have been playing at
14849,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"rolling snowballs, and another have been roasting himself before a great"
14850,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"fire, and let them meet in the porch of the house;—if you ask them how"
14851,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"they feel, I will answer for it you will find them as different in their"
14852,THE POWER OF HABIT.,accounts as the travellers on the Andes. But this is only one example of
14853,THE POWER OF HABIT.,the operation of a universal principle belonging to human nature: for
14854,THE POWER OF HABIT.,the power of habit is the same thing whatever be the circumstance which
14855,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"calls it forth, whether relating to the mind or the body."
14856,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14857,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“You may consider the story you have been reading as a sort of simile or
14858,THE POWER OF HABIT.,parable. The central station on the mountain may be compared to _middle
14859,THE POWER OF HABIT.,life_. With what different feelings is this regarded by those who bask
14860,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"in the sunshine of opulence, and those who shrink under the cold blast"
14861,THE POWER OF HABIT.,of penury!
14862,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14863,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Suppose the wealthy duke, our neighbour, were suddenly obliged to"
14864,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"descend to our level, and live as we do—to part with all his carriages,"
14865,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"sell his coach-horses, and hunters, quit his noble seat with its fine"
14866,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"park and gardens, dismiss all his train of servants except two or three,"
14867,THE POWER OF HABIT.,and take a house like ours; what a dreadful fall it would seem to him!
14868,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"how wretched it would probably make him, and how much would he be pitied"
14869,THE POWER OF HABIT.,by the world!
14870,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14871,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“On the other hand, suppose the labourer who lives in the next cottage"
14872,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"were unexpectedly to fall heir to an estate of a few hundreds a year,"
14873,THE POWER OF HABIT.,and in consequence to get around him all the comforts and conveniences
14874,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"that we possess—a commodious house to inhabit, good clothes to wear,"
14875,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"plenty of wholesome food and firing, servants to do all the drudgery of"
14876,THE POWER OF HABIT.,the family and the like;—how all his acquaintance would congratulate
14877,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"him, and what a paradise would he seem to himself to be got into! Yet"
14878,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"he, and the duke, and ourselves, are equally _men_, made liable by"
14879,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"nature to the same desires and necessities, and perhaps all equally"
14880,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"strong in constitution, and equally capable of supporting hardships. Is"
14881,THE POWER OF HABIT.,not this fully as wonderful a difference in feeling as that on crossing
14882,THE POWER OF HABIT.,the Andes?”
14883,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14884,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Indeed it is,” said William."
14885,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14886,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“And the cause of it must be exactly the same—the influence of habit.”
14887,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14888,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“I think so.”
14889,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14890,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Of what importance then must it be toward a happy life, to regulate our"
14891,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"habits so, that in the possible changes of this world we may be more"
14892,THE POWER OF HABIT.,likely to be gainers than losers!”
14893,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14894,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“But how can this be done? Would it be right for the duke to live like
14895,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"us, or us like the labourer?”"
14896,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14897,THE POWER OF HABIT.,“Certainly not. But to apply the case to persons of our middle
14898,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"condition, I would have us use our advantages in such a frugal manner,"
14899,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"as to make them as little as possible essential to our happiness, should"
14900,THE POWER OF HABIT.,fortune sink us to a lower station. For as to the chance of rising to a
14901,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"higher, there is no need to prepare our habits for that—we should"
14902,THE POWER OF HABIT.,readily enough accommodate our feelings to such a change. To be pleased
14903,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"and satisfied with simple food, to accustom ourselves not to shrink from"
14904,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"the inclemencies of the seasons—to avoid indolence, and take delight in"
14905,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"some useful employment of the mind or body, to do as much as we can for"
14906,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"ourselves, and not expect to be waited upon on every small"
14907,THE POWER OF HABIT.,occasion—these are the habits which will make us in some measure
14908,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"independent of fortune, and secure us a moderate degree of enjoyment"
14909,THE POWER OF HABIT.,under every change short of absolute want. I will tell you a story to
14910,THE POWER OF HABIT.,this purpose.
14911,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14912,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“A London merchant had two sons, James and Richard. James, from a boy,"
14913,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"accustomed himself to every indulgence in his power, and when he grew"
14914,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"up, was quite a fine gentleman. He dressed expensively, frequented"
14915,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"public diversions, kept his hunter at a livery stable, and was a member"
14916,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"of several convivial clubs. At home, it was almost a footman’s sole"
14917,THE POWER OF HABIT.,business to wait on him. He would have thought it greatly beneath him to
14918,THE POWER OF HABIT.,buckle his own shoes; and if he wanted anything at the other end of the
14919,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"room, he would ring the bell, and bring the servant up two pair of"
14920,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"stairs, rather than rise from his chair to fetch it. He did a little"
14921,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"business in the counting-house on forenoons, but devoted all his time"
14922,THE POWER OF HABIT.,after dinner to indolence and amusement.
14923,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14924,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Richard was a different character. He was plain in his appearance, and"
14925,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"domestic in his way of life. He gave as little trouble as possible, and"
14926,THE POWER OF HABIT.,would have been ashamed to ask assistance in doing what he could easily
14927,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"do for himself. He was assiduous in business, and employed his leisure"
14928,THE POWER OF HABIT.,hours chiefly in reading and acquiring useful knowledge.
14929,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14930,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Both were still young and unsettled when their father died, leaving"
14931,THE POWER OF HABIT.,behind him a very trifling property. As the young men had not capital
14932,THE POWER OF HABIT.,sufficient to follow the same line of mercantile business in which he
14933,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"had been engaged, they were obliged to look out for a new plan of"
14934,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"maintenance, and a great reduction of expense was the first thing"
14935,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"requisite. This was a severe stroke to James, who found himself at once"
14936,THE POWER OF HABIT.,cut off from all the pleasures and indulgences to which he was so
14937,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"habituated, that he thought life of no value without them. He grew"
14938,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"melancholy and dejected, hazarded all his little property in lottery"
14939,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"tickets, and was quite beggared. Still, unable to think of retrieving"
14940,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"himself by industry and frugality, he accepted a commission in a"
14941,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"new-raised regiment ordered for the West Indies, where, soon after his"
14942,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"arrival, he caught a fever and died."
14943,THE POWER OF HABIT.,
14944,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"“Richard, in the meantime, whose comforts were little impaired by his"
14945,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"change of situation, preserved his cheerfulness, and found no difficulty"
14946,THE POWER OF HABIT.,in accommodating himself to his fortune. He engaged himself as a clerk
14947,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"in a house his father had been connected with, and lived as frugally as"
14948,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"possible upon his salary. It furnished him with decent board, lodging,"
14949,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"and clothing, which was all he required, and his hours of leisure were"
14950,THE POWER OF HABIT.,nearly as many as before. A book or a sober friend always sufficed to
14951,THE POWER OF HABIT.,procure him an agreeable evening. He gradually rose in the confidence of
14952,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"his employers, who increased from time to time his salary and"
14953,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"emoluments. Every increase was a source of gratification to him, because"
14954,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"he was able to enjoy pleasures which, however, habit had not made"
14955,THE POWER OF HABIT.,necessary to his comfort. In process of time he was enabled to settle
14956,THE POWER OF HABIT.,"for himself, and passed through life in the enjoyment of that modest"
14957,THE POWER OF HABIT.,competence which best suited his disposition.”

14965,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“You may remember, Oswald,” said Mr. B. to his son, “that I gave you"
14966,THE COST OF A WAR.,some time ago a notion of _the price of a victory_ to the poor souls
14967,THE COST OF A WAR.,engaged in it.”
14968,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14969,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“I shall not soon forget it, I assure you, sir,” replied Oswald."
14970,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14971,THE COST OF A WAR.,_Father._ Very well; I mean now to give you some idea _of the cost of a
14972,THE COST OF A WAR.,war_ to the people among whom it is carried on. This may serve to abate
14973,THE COST OF A WAR.,something of the admiration with which historians are to apt to inspire
14974,THE COST OF A WAR.,"us for great warriors and conquerors. You have heard, I doubt not, of"
14975,THE COST OF A WAR.,"Louis the Fourteenth, king of France?"
14976,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14977,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Oswald._ Oh, yes!"
14978,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14979,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Fa._ He was entitled by his subjects _Louis le Grand_, and was compared"
14980,THE COST OF A WAR.,by them to the Cesars and Alexanders of antiquity; and with some justice
14981,THE COST OF A WAR.,"as to the extent of his power, and the use he made of it. He was the"
14982,THE COST OF A WAR.,most potent prince of his time; commanded mighty and victorious armies;
14983,THE COST OF A WAR.,and enlarged the limits of his hereditary dominions. Louis was not
14984,THE COST OF A WAR.,naturally a hard-hearted man; but having been taught from his cradle
14985,THE COST OF A WAR.,"that everything ought to give way to the interests of his glory, and"
14986,THE COST OF A WAR.,"that this glory consisted in domineering over his neighbours, and making"
14987,THE COST OF A WAR.,"conquests, he grew to be insensible to all the miseries brought on his"
14988,THE COST OF A WAR.,"own and other people, in pursuit of this noble design, as he thought it."
14989,THE COST OF A WAR.,"Moreover, he was plunged in dissolute pleasures, and the delights of"
14990,THE COST OF A WAR.,"pomp and splendour, from his youth; and he was ever surrounded by a"
14991,THE COST OF A WAR.,"tribe of abject flatterers, who made him believe that he had a full"
14992,THE COST OF A WAR.,"right, in all cases to do as he pleased. Conquest abroad and pleasure at"
14993,THE COST OF A WAR.,"home, were therefore the chief business of his life."
14994,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14995,THE COST OF A WAR.,"One evening, his minister, Louvois, came to him and said, “Sire, it is"
14996,THE COST OF A WAR.,absolutely necessary to make a desert of the _Palatinate_.”
14997,THE COST OF A WAR.,
14998,THE COST OF A WAR.,"This is a country in Germany, on the banks of the Rhine, one of the most"
14999,THE COST OF A WAR.,"populous and best-cultivated districts in that empire, filled with towns"
15000,THE COST OF A WAR.,"and villages, and industrious inhabitants."
15001,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15002,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“I should be sorry to do it,” replied the king, “for you know how much"
15003,THE COST OF A WAR.,odium we acquired throughout Europe when a part of it was laid waste
15004,THE COST OF A WAR.,"sometime ago, under Marshal Turenne.”"
15005,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15006,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“It cannot be helped, sire,” returned Louvois. “All the damage he did"
15007,THE COST OF A WAR.,"has been repaired, and the country is as flourishing as ever. If we"
15008,THE COST OF A WAR.,leave it in its present state it will afford quarters to your majesty’s
15009,THE COST OF A WAR.,"enemies, and endanger your conquests. It must be entirely ruined—the"
15010,THE COST OF A WAR.,good of the service will not permit it to be otherwise.”
15011,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15012,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“Well, then,” answered Louis, “if it must be so, you are to give orders"
15013,THE COST OF A WAR.,"accordingly.” So saying, he left the cabinet, and went to assist a"
15014,THE COST OF A WAR.,magnificent festival given in honour of his favourite mistress by a
15015,THE COST OF A WAR.,prince of the blood.
15016,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15017,THE COST OF A WAR.,The pitiless Louvois lost no time; but despatched a courier that very
15018,THE COST OF A WAR.,"night, with positive orders to the French generals in the Palatinate to"
15019,THE COST OF A WAR.,carry fire and desolation through the whole country—not to leave a house
15020,THE COST OF A WAR.,or a tree standing—and to expel all the inhabitants.
15021,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15022,THE COST OF A WAR.,It was the midst of a rigorous winter.
15023,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15024,THE COST OF A WAR.,_Os._ O horrible! but surely the generals would not obey such orders?
15025,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15026,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Fa._ What, a general disobey the commands of his sovereign!—That would"
15027,THE COST OF A WAR.,be contrary to every maxim of the _trade_. Right and wrong are no
15028,THE COST OF A WAR.,considerations to a military man. He is only to do as he is bid. The
15029,THE COST OF A WAR.,"French generals who were upon the spot, and must see with their own eyes"
15030,THE COST OF A WAR.,"all that was done, probably felt somewhat like men on the occasion; but"
15031,THE COST OF A WAR.,the sacrifice to their duty as soldiers was so much the greater. The
15032,THE COST OF A WAR.,"commands were peremptory, and they were obeyed to a tittle. Towns and"
15033,THE COST OF A WAR.,villages were burnt to the ground; vineyards and orchards were cut down
15034,THE COST OF A WAR.,and rooted up; sheep and cattle were killed; all the fair works of ages
15035,THE COST OF A WAR.,were destroyed in a moment; and the smiling face of culture was turned
15036,THE COST OF A WAR.,to a dreary waste.
15037,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15038,THE COST OF A WAR.,The poor inhabitants were driven from their warm and comfortable
15039,THE COST OF A WAR.,"habitations into the open fields, to confront all the inclemencies of"
15040,THE COST OF A WAR.,"the season. Their furniture was burnt or pillaged, and nothing was left"
15041,THE COST OF A WAR.,"them but the clothes on their backs, and the few necessaries they could"
15042,THE COST OF A WAR.,"carry with them. The roads were covered with trembling fugitives, going"
15043,THE COST OF A WAR.,"they knew not whither, shivering with cold and pinched with hunger. Here"
15044,THE COST OF A WAR.,"an old man, dropping with fatigue, lay down to die—there a woman with a"
15045,THE COST OF A WAR.,"new-born infant sunk perishing on the snow, while her husband hung over"
15046,THE COST OF A WAR.,them in all the horror of despair.
15047,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15048,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Os._ O, what a scene! Poor creatures! What became of them at last?"
15049,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15050,THE COST OF A WAR.,_Fa._ Such of them as did not perish on the road got to the neighbouring
15051,THE COST OF A WAR.,"towns, where they were received with all the hospitality that such"
15052,THE COST OF A WAR.,calamitous times would afford; but they were beggared for life.
15053,THE COST OF A WAR.,"Meantime, their country for many a league round displayed no other sight"
15054,THE COST OF A WAR.,than that of black smoking ruins in the midst of silence and desolation.
15055,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15056,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Os._ I hope, however, that such things do not often happen in war."
15057,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15058,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Fa._ Not often, perhaps, to the same extent: but in some degree they"
15059,THE COST OF A WAR.,must take place in every war. A village which would afford a favourable
15060,THE COST OF A WAR.,post to the enemy is always burnt without hesitation. A country which
15061,THE COST OF A WAR.,"can no longer be maintained, is cleared of all its provision and forage"
15062,THE COST OF A WAR.,"before it is abandoned, lest the enemy should have the advantage of"
15063,THE COST OF A WAR.,them; and the poor inhabitants are left to subsist as they can. Crops of
15064,THE COST OF A WAR.,"corn are trampled down by armies in their march, or devoured while green"
15065,THE COST OF A WAR.,"as fodder for their horses. Pillage, robbery and murder, are always"
15066,THE COST OF A WAR.,going on in the outskirts of the best-disciplined camp. Then consider
15067,THE COST OF A WAR.,"what must happen in every siege. On the first approach of the enemy, all"
15068,THE COST OF A WAR.,"the buildings in the suburbs of a town are demolished, and all the trees"
15069,THE COST OF A WAR.,"in gardens and public walks are cut down, lest they should afford"
15070,THE COST OF A WAR.,"shelter to the besiegers. As the siege goes on, bombs, hot balls, and"
15071,THE COST OF A WAR.,"cannon-shot, are continually flying about; by which the greatest part of"
15072,THE COST OF A WAR.,"a town is ruined or laid in ashes, and many of the innocent people"
15073,THE COST OF A WAR.,"killed or maimed. If the resistance is obstinate, famine and pestilence"
15074,THE COST OF A WAR.,"are sure to take place; and if the garrison holds out to the last, and"
15075,THE COST OF A WAR.,"the town is taken by storm, it is generally given up to be pillaged by"
15076,THE COST OF A WAR.,the enraged and licentious soldiery.
15077,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15078,THE COST OF A WAR.,It would be easy to bring too many examples of cruelty exercised upon a
15079,THE COST OF A WAR.,"conquered country, even in very late times, when war is said to be"
15080,THE COST OF A WAR.,"carried on with so much humanity; but, indeed, how can it be otherwise?"
15081,THE COST OF A WAR.,"The art of war is essentially that of destruction, and it is impossible"
15082,THE COST OF A WAR.,there should be a mild and merciful way of murdering and ruining one’s
15083,THE COST OF A WAR.,"fellow-creatures. Soldiers, as men, are often humane; but war must ever"
15084,THE COST OF A WAR.,be cruel. Though Homer has filled his Iliad with the exploits of
15085,THE COST OF A WAR.,"fighting heroes, yet he makes Jupiter address Mars, the god of War, in"
15086,THE COST OF A WAR.,terms of the utmost abhorrence:—
15087,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15088,THE COST OF A WAR.,"“Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,"
15089,THE COST OF A WAR.,"Thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes;"
15090,THE COST OF A WAR.,"In human discord is thy dire delight,"
15091,THE COST OF A WAR.,"The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight:"
15092,THE COST OF A WAR.,"No bound, no law, thy fiery temper quells.”—POPE."
15093,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15094,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Os._ Surely, as war is so bad a thing, there might be some way of"
15095,THE COST OF A WAR.,preventing it.
15096,THE COST OF A WAR.,
15097,THE COST OF A WAR.,"_Fa._ Alas! I fear mankind have been too long accustomed to it, and it"
15098,THE COST OF A WAR.,"is too agreeable to their bad passions, easily to be laid aside,"
15099,THE COST OF A WAR.,"whatever miseries it may bring upon them. But, in the meantime, let us"
15100,THE COST OF A WAR.,"correct our own ideas of the matter, and no longer lavish admiration"
15101,THE COST OF A WAR.,"upon such a pest of the human race as a _Conqueror_, how brilliant"
15102,THE COST OF A WAR.,soever his qualities may be; nor ever think that a profession which
15103,THE COST OF A WAR.,binds a man to be the servile instrument of cruelty and injustice is an

15119,GREAT MEN.,"“I will show you a _great man_,” said Mr. C. one day to his son, at the"
15120,GREAT MEN.,time the duke of Bridgewater’s canal was making. He accordingly took him
15121,GREAT MEN.,to a place where several workmen were employed in raising a prodigious
15122,GREAT MEN.,"mound, on the top of which the canal was to be carried across a deep"
15123,GREAT MEN.,"valley. In the midst of them was a very plain-dressed man, awkward in"
15124,GREAT MEN.,"his gestures, uncouth in his appearance, and rather heavy in his"
15125,GREAT MEN.,"countenance—in short, a mere countryman like the rest. He had a plan in"
15126,GREAT MEN.,"his hand and was giving directions to the people around him, and"
15127,GREAT MEN.,"surveying the whole labour with profound attention. “This, Arthur,” said"
15128,GREAT MEN.,"Mr. C., “is the _great Mr. Brindley_.”"
15129,GREAT MEN.,
15130,GREAT MEN.,"“What,” cried Arthur in surprise, “is that a _great man_?”"
15131,GREAT MEN.,
15132,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ Yes, a very great man. Why are you surprised?"
15133,GREAT MEN.,
15134,GREAT MEN.,"_Ar._ I don’t know, but I should have expected a great man to have"
15135,GREAT MEN.,looked very differently.
15136,GREAT MEN.,
15137,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ It matters little how a man looks, if he can perform great"
15138,GREAT MEN.,"things. That person, without any advantages of education, has become, by"
15139,GREAT MEN.,"the force of his own genius, the first engineer of the age. He is doing"
15140,GREAT MEN.,things that were never done or even thought of in this country before.
15141,GREAT MEN.,"He pierces hills, makes bridges over valleys, and aqueducts across"
15142,GREAT MEN.,"navigable rivers, and, in short, is likely to change the whole face of"
15143,GREAT MEN.,"the country, and to introduce improvements the value of which cannot be"
15144,GREAT MEN.,"calculated. When at a loss how to bring about any of his designs, he"
15145,GREAT MEN.,"does not go to other people for assistance, but he consults the"
15146,GREAT MEN.,"wonderful faculties of his own mind, and finds a way to overcome his"
15147,GREAT MEN.,"difficulties. He looks like a rustic it is true, but he has a soul of"
15148,GREAT MEN.,"the first order, such as is not granted to one out of millions of the"
15149,GREAT MEN.,human race.
15150,GREAT MEN.,
15151,GREAT MEN.,_Ar._ But are all men of extraordinary abilities properly _great men_?
15152,GREAT MEN.,
15153,GREAT MEN.,_Mr. C._ The word has been variously used; but I would call every one a
15154,GREAT MEN.,great man _who does great things by means of his own powers_. Great
15155,GREAT MEN.,"abilities are often employed about trifles, or indolently wasted without"
15156,GREAT MEN.,"any considerable exertion at all. To make a great man, the object"
15157,GREAT MEN.,"pursued should be large and important, and vigour and perseverance"
15158,GREAT MEN.,should be employed in the pursuit.
15159,GREAT MEN.,
15160,GREAT MEN.,"_Ar._ All the great men I remember to have read about were kings, or"
15161,GREAT MEN.,"generals, or prime ministers, or in some high station or other."
15162,GREAT MEN.,
15163,GREAT MEN.,_Mr. C._ It is natural they should stand foremost in the list of great
15164,GREAT MEN.,"men, because the sphere in which they act is an extensive one, and what"
15165,GREAT MEN.,they do has a powerful influence over numbers of mankind. Yet those that
15166,GREAT MEN.,"invent useful arts, or discover important truths which may promote the"
15167,GREAT MEN.,comfort and happiness of unborn generations in the most distant parts of
15168,GREAT MEN.,"the world, act a still more important part; and their claim to merit is"
15169,GREAT MEN.,"generally more undoubted than that of the former, because what they do"
15170,GREAT MEN.,is more certainly their own.
15171,GREAT MEN.,
15172,GREAT MEN.,In order to estimate the real share a man in a high station has had in
15173,GREAT MEN.,"the great events which have been attributed to him, strip him in your"
15174,GREAT MEN.,"imagination of all the external advantages of rank and power, and see"
15175,GREAT MEN.,what a figure he would have made without them; or fancy a common man put
15176,GREAT MEN.,"in his place, and judge whether affairs would have gone on in the same"
15177,GREAT MEN.,"track. Augustus Cesar, and Louis XIV. of France, have both been called"
15178,GREAT MEN.,"great princes; but deprive them of their crown, and they will both"
15179,GREAT MEN.,dwindle into obscure and trivial characters. But no change of
15180,GREAT MEN.,circumstances could reduce Alfred the Great to the level of a common
15181,GREAT MEN.,"man. The two former could sink into their graves, and yield their power"
15182,GREAT MEN.,"to a successor, and scarcely be missed; but Alfred’s death changed the"
15183,GREAT MEN.,fate of his kingdom. Thus with Epaminondas fell all the glory and
15184,GREAT MEN.,"greatness of the Theban state. He first raised it to consequence, and it"
15185,GREAT MEN.,could not survive him.
15186,GREAT MEN.,
15187,GREAT MEN.,_Ar._ Was not Czar Peter a great man?
15188,GREAT MEN.,
15189,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ I am not sure he deserves that title. Being a despotic prince,"
15190,GREAT MEN.,"at the head of a vast empire, he could put into execution whatever plans"
15191,GREAT MEN.,"he was led to adopt, and these plans in general were grand and"
15192,GREAT MEN.,beneficial to his country. But the means he used were such as the master
15193,GREAT MEN.,"of the lives and fortunes of millions could easily employ, and there was"
15194,GREAT MEN.,more of brutal force than of skill and judgment in the manner in which
15195,GREAT MEN.,he pursued his designs. Still he was an _extraordinary_ man; and the
15196,GREAT MEN.,"resolution of leaving his throne, in order to acquire in foreign"
15197,GREAT MEN.,"countries the knowledge necessary to rescue his own from barbarism, was"
15198,GREAT MEN.,"a feature of greatness. A truly great prince, however, would have"
15199,GREAT MEN.,employed himself better than in learning to build boats at Saardam.
15200,GREAT MEN.,
15201,GREAT MEN.,_Ar._ What was Alexander the Great?
15202,GREAT MEN.,
15203,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ A great conqueror, but not a great man. It was easy for him,"
15204,GREAT MEN.,with the well-disciplined army of Greeks which he received from his
15205,GREAT MEN.,"father Philip, to overrun the unwarlike kingdoms of Asia, and defeat the"
15206,GREAT MEN.,"Great King, as the king of Persia was called: but though he showed some"
15207,GREAT MEN.,"marks of an elevated mind, he seems to have possessed few qualities"
15208,GREAT MEN.,which could have raised him to distinction had he been born in an humble
15209,GREAT MEN.,"station. Compare his fugitive grandeur, supported by able ministers and"
15210,GREAT MEN.,"generals, to the power which his tutor the great Aristotle, merely"
15211,GREAT MEN.,"through the force of his own genius, exercised over men’s minds"
15212,GREAT MEN.,throughout the most civilized part of the world for two thousand years
15213,GREAT MEN.,after his death. Compare also the part which has been acted in the world
15214,GREAT MEN.,"by the Spanish monarchs, the masters of immense possessions in Europe"
15215,GREAT MEN.,"and America, to that by Christopher Columbus, the Genoese navigator, who"
15216,GREAT MEN.,could have it inscribed on his tombstones that he _gave_ a new world to
15217,GREAT MEN.,the kingdom of Castile and Aragon. These comparisons will teach you to
15218,GREAT MEN.,"distinguish between greatness of character and greatness of station,"
15219,GREAT MEN.,which are too often confounded. He who governs a great country may in
15220,GREAT MEN.,one sense be called a great king; but this is no more than an
15221,GREAT MEN.,"appellation belonging to rank, like that of the Great Mogul, or the"
15222,GREAT MEN.,"Grand Seignor, and infers no more personal grandeur than the title of"
15223,GREAT MEN.,"Mr. Such-a-one, the Great Grocer, or Great Brewer."
15224,GREAT MEN.,
15225,GREAT MEN.,"_Ar._ Must not great men be good men, too?"
15226,GREAT MEN.,
15227,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ If that man is great who does great things, it will not follow"
15228,GREAT MEN.,"that goodness must necessarily be one of his qualities, since that"
15229,GREAT MEN.,"chiefly refers to the end and intentions of actions. Julius Cesar, and"
15230,GREAT MEN.,"Cromwell, for example, were men capable of the greatest exploits; but"
15231,GREAT MEN.,"directing them, not to the public good, but to the purposes of their own"
15232,GREAT MEN.,"ambition, in pursuit of which they violated all the duties of morality,"
15233,GREAT MEN.,"they have obtained the title of _great bad men_. A person, however,"
15234,GREAT MEN.,"cannot be great at all without possessing many virtues. He must be firm,"
15235,GREAT MEN.,"steady, and diligent, superior to difficulties and dangers, and equally"
15236,GREAT MEN.,superior to the allurements of ease and pleasure. For want of these
15237,GREAT MEN.,"moral qualities, many persons of exalted minds and great talents have"
15238,GREAT MEN.,failed to deserve the title of great men. It is in vain that the French
15239,GREAT MEN.,poets and historians have decorated Henry the Fourth with the name of
15240,GREAT MEN.,Great; his facility of disposition and uncontrollable love of pleasure
15241,GREAT MEN.,have caused him to forfeit his claim to it in the estimation of
15242,GREAT MEN.,"impartial judges. As power is essential to greatness, a man cannot be"
15243,GREAT MEN.,"great without _power over himself_, which is the highest kind of power."
15244,GREAT MEN.,
15245,GREAT MEN.,"_Ar._ After all, is it not better to be a good man than a great one?"
15246,GREAT MEN.,
15247,GREAT MEN.,"_Mr. C._ There is more merit in being a good man, because it is what we"
15248,GREAT MEN.,"make ourselves, whereas the talents that produce greatness are the gift"
15249,GREAT MEN.,"of nature; though they may be improved by our own efforts, they cannot"
15250,GREAT MEN.,be acquired. But if goodness is the proper object of our love and
15251,GREAT MEN.,"esteem, greatness deserves our high admiration and respect. This Mr."
15252,GREAT MEN.,"Brindley before us is by all accounts a worthy man, but it is not for"
15253,GREAT MEN.,this reason I have brought you to see him. I wish you to look upon him
15254,GREAT MEN.,as one of those sublime and uncommon objects of nature which fill the
15255,GREAT MEN.,"mind with a certain awe and astonishment. Next to being great oneself,"
15256,GREAT MEN.,it is desirable to have a true relish for greatness.

15266,THE FOUR SISTERS.,a sketch of our history and characters. You will not wonder there should

15270,THE FOUR SISTERS.,impossible for anybody to live among us in such a scene of tumult and
15271,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"disorder. These brawls, however, by a powerful interposition, were put"

15279,THE FOUR SISTERS.,any of us; but she is hot: everything serves for fuel to her fury when
15280,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"it is once raised to a certain degree, and she is so mischievous"
15281,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"whenever she gets the upper hand, that notwithstanding her aspiring"
15282,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"disposition, if I may freely speak my mind, she is calculated to make a"
15283,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"good servant, but a very bad mistress."
15284,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15285,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"I am almost ashamed to mention that, notwithstanding her seeming"
15286,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"delicacy, she has a most voracious appetite, and devours everything that"
15287,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"comes in her way; though, like other eager thin people, she does no"
15288,THE FOUR SISTERS.,credit to her keeping. Many a time she has consumed the product of my
15289,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"barns and storehouses, but it is all lost upon her. She has even been"
15290,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"known to get into an oil-shop or tallow-chandler’s, when everybody was"
15291,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"asleep, and lick up with the utmost greediness whatever she found there."
15292,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"Indeed, all prudent people are aware of her tricks, and though she is"
15293,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"admitted into the best families, they take care to watch her very"
15294,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"narrowly. I should not forget to mention, that my sister was once in a"
15295,THE FOUR SISTERS.,country where she was treated with uncommon respect; she was lodged in a
15296,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"sumptuous building, and had a number of young women of the best families"
15297,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"to attend on her, and feed her, and watch over her health: in short, she"
15298,THE FOUR SISTERS.,was looked upon as something more than a common mortal. But she always
15299,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"behaved with great severity to her maids, and if any of them were"
15300,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"negligent of their duty, or made a slip in their own conduct, nothing"
15301,THE FOUR SISTERS.,would serve her but burying the poor girls alive. I have myself had some
15302,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"dark hints and intimations from the most respectable authority, that she"
15303,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"will some time or other make an end of me. You need not wonder,"
15304,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"therefore, if I am jealous of her motions."
15305,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15306,THE FOUR SISTERS.,The next sister I shall mention to you has so far the appearance of
15307,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"modesty and humility, that she generally seeks the lowest place. She is"
15308,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"indeed of a very yielding easy temper, generally cool, and often wears a"
15309,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"sweet placid smile upon her countenance; but she is easily ruffled, and"
15310,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"when worked up, as she often is, by another sister, whom I shall mention"
15311,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"to you by-and-by, she becomes a perfect fury. Indeed, she is so apt to"
15312,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"swell with sudden gusts of passion, that she is suspected at times to be"
15313,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"a little lunatic. Between her and my first-mentioned sister, there is a"
15314,THE FOUR SISTERS.,more settled antipathy than between the Theban pair; and they never meet
15315,THE FOUR SISTERS.,without making efforts to destroy one another. With me she is always
15316,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"ready to form the most intimate union, but it is not always to my"
15317,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"advantage. There goes a story in our family, that when we were all"
15318,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"young, she once attempted to drown me. She actually kept me under water"
15319,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"a considerable time, and though at length I got my head above water, my"
15320,THE FOUR SISTERS.,constitution is generally thought to have been essentially injured by it
15321,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"ever since. From that time she has made no such atrocious attempt, but"
15322,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"she is continually making encroachments upon my property, and even when"
15323,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"she appears most gentle, she is very insidious, and has such an"
15324,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"undermining way with her, that her insinuating arts are as much to be"
15325,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"dreaded as open violence. I might indeed remonstrate, but it is a known"
15326,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"part of her character, that nothing makes any lasting impression upon"
15327,THE FOUR SISTERS.,her.
15328,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15329,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"As to my third sister, I have already mentioned the ill office she does"
15330,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"me with my last-mentioned one, who is entirely under her influence. She"
15331,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"is besides of a very uncertain, variable temper, sometimes hot, and"
15332,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"sometimes cold, nobody knows where to have her. Her lightness is ever"
15333,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"proverbial, and she has nothing to give those who live with her more"
15334,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"substantial than the smiles of courtiers. I must add, that she keeps in"
15335,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"her service three or four rough blustering bullies, with puffed cheeks,"
15336,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"who when they are let loose, think they have nothing to do but drive the"
15337,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"world before them. She sometimes joins with my first sister, and their"
15338,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"violence occasionally throws me into such a trembling, that, though"
15339,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"naturally of a firm constitution, I shake as if I was in an ague fit."
15340,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15341,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"As to myself, I am of a steady, solid temper; not shining, indeed, but"
15342,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"kind and liberal, quite a Lady Bountiful. Every one tastes of my"
15343,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"beneficence, and I am of so grateful a disposition, that I have been"
15344,THE FOUR SISTERS.,known to return a hundred-fold for any present that has been made me. I
15345,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"feed and clothe all my children, and afford a welcome home to the wretch"
15346,THE FOUR SISTERS.,who has no other. I bear with unrepining patience all manner of ill
15347,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"usage; I am trampled upon, I am torn and wounded with the most cutting"
15348,THE FOUR SISTERS.,strokes; I am pillaged of the treasures hidden in my most secret
15349,THE FOUR SISTERS.,chambers; notwithstanding which I am always ready to return good for
15350,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"evil, and am continually subservient to the pleasures or advantage of"
15351,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"others; yet so ungrateful is the world, that because I do not possess"
15352,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"all the airiness and activity of my sisters, I am stigmatized as dull"
15353,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"and heavy. Every sordid, miserly fellow is called by way of derision one"
15354,THE FOUR SISTERS.,of my children; and if a person on entering a room does but turn his
15355,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"eyes upon me, he is thought stupid and mean, and not fit for good"
15356,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"company. I have the satisfaction, however, of finding that people always"
15357,THE FOUR SISTERS.,incline towards me as they grow older; and that those who seemed proudly
15358,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"to disdain any affinity with me, are content to sink at last into my"
15359,THE FOUR SISTERS.,bosom. You will probably wish to have some account of my person. I am
15360,THE FOUR SISTERS.,not a regular beauty; some of my features are rather harsh and
15361,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"prominent, when viewed separately; but my countenance has so much"
15362,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"variety of expression, and so many different aspects of elegance, that"
15363,THE FOUR SISTERS.,those who study my face with attention find out continually new charms;
15364,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"and it may be truly said of me, what Titus says of his mistress, and for"
15365,THE FOUR SISTERS.,a much longer space:—
15366,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15367,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"“Pendant cinq ans entières tous les jours je la vois,"
15368,THE FOUR SISTERS.,Et crois toujours la voir pour la première fois.”
15369,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15370,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"“For five whole years each day she meets my view,"
15371,THE FOUR SISTERS.,Yet every day I seem to see her new.”
15372,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15373,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"Though I have been so long a mother, I have still a surprising air of"
15374,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"youth and freshness, which is assisted by all the advantages of"
15375,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"well-chosen ornament, for I dress well, and according to the season."
15376,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15377,THE FOUR SISTERS.,This is what I have to say chiefly of myself and my sisters. To a person
15378,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"of your sagacity it will be unnecessary for me to sign my name. Indeed,"
15379,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"one who becomes acquainted with any one of the family, cannot be at a"
15380,THE FOUR SISTERS.,"loss to discover the rest, notwithstanding the difference in our"
15381,THE FOUR SISTERS.,features and characters.
15382,THE FOUR SISTERS.,
15383,THE FOUR SISTERS.,

15386,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.
15387,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15388,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15389,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"Philander possessed a considerable place about the court, which obliged"
15390,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"him to live in a style of show and expense. He kept high company, made"
15391,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"frequent entertainments, and brought up a family of several daughters in"
15392,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,all the luxurious elegance which his situation and prospects seemed to
15393,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"justify. His wife had balls and routs at her own house, and frequented"
15394,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,all the places of fashionable amusement. After some years passed in this
15395,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"manner, a sudden change of parties threw Philander out of his"
15396,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"employment, and at once ruined all his plans of future advancement."
15397,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"Though his place had been lucrative, the expense it led him into more"
15398,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"than compensated the profits, so that, instead of saving anything, he"
15399,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"had involved himself considerably in debt. His creditors, on hearing of"
15400,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"the change in his affairs, became so importunate, that, in order to"
15401,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"satisfy them, he was compelled to sell a moderate paternal estate in a"
15402,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"remote county, reserving nothing out of it but one small farm. Philander"
15403,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,had strength of mind sufficient to enable him at once to decide on the
15404,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"best plan to be followed in his present circumstances; instead,"
15405,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"therefore, of wasting his time and remaining property in fruitless"
15406,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"attempts to interest his town friends in his favour, he sold off his"
15407,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"fine furniture, and without delay carried down his whole family to the"
15408,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"little spot he could still call his own, where he commenced a life of"
15409,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,industry and strict frugality in the capacity of a small farmer. It was
15410,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,long before the female part of his household could accommodate
15411,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"themselves to a mode of living so new to them, and so destitute of all"
15412,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,that they had been accustomed to regard as essential to their very
15413,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"existence. At length, however, mutual affection and natural good sense,"
15414,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"and above all, necessity, brought them to acquiesce tolerably in their"
15415,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"situation, and to engage in earnest in its duties. Occasional regrets,"
15416,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"however, could not but remain; and the silent sigh would tell whither"
15417,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,their thoughts were fled.
15418,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15419,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"Philander perceived it, but took care never to embitter their feelings"
15420,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,by harsh chidings or untimely admonitions. But on the anniversary of
15421,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"their taking possession of the farmhouse, he assembled them under a"
15422,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"spreading tree that grew before their little garden, and while the"
15423,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"summer’s sun gilded all the objects around, he thus addressed them:—"
15424,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15425,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"“My dear partners in every fortune, if the revolution of a year has had"
15426,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"the effect on your mind that it has on mine, I may congratulate you on"
15427,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"your condition. I am now able with a firm tone to ask myself, what have"
15428,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"I lost? and I feel so much more to be pleased with than to regret, that"
15429,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,the question gives me rather comfort than sorrow. Look at yon splendid
15430,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"luminary, and tell me if its gradual appearance above the horizon on a"
15431,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"fine morning, shedding light and joy over the wide creation, be not a"
15432,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,grander as well as a more heart-cheering spectacle than that of the most
15433,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"magnificent saloon, illuminated with dazzling lustres. Is not the spirit"
15434,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"of the wholesome breeze, fresh from the mountain, and perfumed with wild"
15435,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"flowers, infinitely more invigorating to the senses than the air of the"
15436,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"crowded drawing-room, loaded with scented powder and essences? Did we"
15437,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,relish so well the disguised dishes with which a French cook strove to
15438,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"whet our sickly appetites, as we do our draught of new milk, our"
15439,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"homemade loaf, and the other articles of our simple fare? Was our sleep"
15440,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"so sweet after midnight suppers and the long vigils of cards, as it is"
15441,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"now, that early rising and the exercises of the day prepare us for"
15442,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,closing our eyes as soon as night has covered everything with her
15443,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,friendly veil? Shall we complain that our clothes at present only answer
15444,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"the purpose of keeping us warm, when we recollect all the care and pains"
15445,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"it cost us to keep pace with the fashion, and the mortification we"
15446,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,underwent at being outshone by our superiors in fortune? Did not the
15447,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,vexation of insolent and unfaithful servants overbalance the trouble we
15448,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,now find in waiting on ourselves? We may regret the loss of society;
15449,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"but, alas! what was the society of a crowd of visiters who regarded us"
15450,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"merely as the keepers of a place of public resort, and whom we visited"
15451,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,with similar sensations? If we formerly could command leisure to
15452,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"cultivate our minds and acquire polite accomplishments, did we, in"
15453,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"reality, apply much leisure to these purposes, and is not our time now"
15454,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,filled more to our satisfaction by employments of which we cannot doubt
15455,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,the usefulness? not to say that the moral virtues we are now called upon
15456,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"to exercise afford the truest cultivation to our minds. What, then, have"
15457,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"we lost? In improved health, the charms of a beautiful country, a decent"
15458,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"supply of all real wants, and the love and kind offices of each other,"
15459,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"do not we still possess enough for worldly happiness? We have lost,"
15460,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"indeed, a certain rank and station in life; but have we not acquired"
15461,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,another as truly respectable? We are debarred the prospects of future
15462,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"advancement; but if our present condition is a good one, why need we"
15463,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,lament that it is likely to be lasting? The next anniversary will find
15464,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,us more in harmony with our situation than even the present. Look
15465,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"forward, then, cheerily. The storm is past. We have been shipwrecked,"
15466,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"but we have only exchanged a cumbrous vessel for a light pinnace, and we"
15467,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"are again on our course. Much of our cargo has been thrown overboard,"
15468,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,but no one loses what he does not miss.”
15469,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15470,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"Thus saying, Philander tenderly embraced his wife and daughters. The"
15471,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,"tear stood in their eyes, but consolation beamed on their hearts."
15472,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15473,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15474,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15475,THE GAIN OF A LOSS.,
15476,WISE MEN.,WISE MEN.
15477,WISE MEN.,
15478,WISE MEN.,
15479,WISE MEN.,"“You may remember, Arthur,” said Mr. C. to his son, “that, sometime ago,"
15480,WISE MEN.,I endeavoured to give you a notion what a _great man_ was. Suppose we
15481,WISE MEN.,now talk a little about _wise men_?”
15482,WISE MEN.,
15483,WISE MEN.,"“With all my heart, sir,” replied Arthur."
15484,WISE MEN.,
15485,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ A wise man, then, is _he who pursues the best ends by the"
15486,WISE MEN.,properest means_. But as this definition may be rather too abstract to
15487,WISE MEN.,"give you a clear comprehension of the thing, I shall open it to you by"
15488,WISE MEN.,examples. What do you think is the best end a man can pursue in life?
15489,WISE MEN.,
15490,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ I suppose to make himself happy.
15491,WISE MEN.,
15492,WISE MEN.,_Mr. C._ True. And as we are so constituted that we cannot be happy
15493,WISE MEN.,"ourselves without making others happy, the best end of living is to"
15494,WISE MEN.,produce as much general happiness as lies in our power.
15495,WISE MEN.,
15496,WISE MEN.,"_Ar._ But that is _goodness_, is it not?"
15497,WISE MEN.,
15498,WISE MEN.,_Mr. C._ It is; and therefore wisdom includes goodness. The wise man
15499,WISE MEN.,"always intends what is good, and employs skill or judgment in attaining"
15500,WISE MEN.,"it. If he were to pursue the best things weakly, he could not be wise;"
15501,WISE MEN.,any more than if he were to pursue bad or indifferent things
15502,WISE MEN.,judiciously. One of the wisest men I know is our neighbour Mr. Freeland.
15503,WISE MEN.,
15504,WISE MEN.,"_Ar._ What, the justice?"
15505,WISE MEN.,
15506,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ Yes, few men have succeeded more perfectly in securing their"
15507,WISE MEN.,"own happiness, and promoting that of those around them. Born to a"
15508,WISE MEN.,"competent estate, he early settled upon it, and began to improve it. He"
15509,WISE MEN.,"reduced all his expenses within his income, and indulged no tastes that"
15510,WISE MEN.,could lead him into excesses of any kind. At the same time he did not
15511,WISE MEN.,refuse any proper and innocent pleasures that came in his way; and his
15512,WISE MEN.,house has always been distinguished for decent cheerfulness and
15513,WISE MEN.,hospitality. He applied himself with diligence to mending the morals and
15514,WISE MEN.,improving the condition of his dependants. He studied attentively the
15515,WISE MEN.,"laws of his country, and qualified himself for administering justice"
15516,WISE MEN.,"with skill and fidelity. No one discovers sooner where the right lies,"
15517,WISE MEN.,or takes surer means to enforce it. He is the person to whom the
15518,WISE MEN.,neighbours of all degrees apply for counsel in their difficulties. His
15519,WISE MEN.,"conduct is always consistent and uniform—never violent, never rash,"
15520,WISE MEN.,"never in extremes, but always deliberating before he acts, and then"
15521,WISE MEN.,acting with firmness and vigour. The peace and good order of the whole
15522,WISE MEN.,neighbourhood materially depend upon him; and upon every emergency his
15523,WISE MEN.,opinion is the first thing inquired after. He enjoys the respect of the
15524,WISE MEN.,"rich, the confidence of the poor, and the good-will of both."
15525,WISE MEN.,
15526,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ But I have heard some people reckon old Harpy as wise a man as he.
15527,WISE MEN.,
15528,WISE MEN.,_Mr. C._ It is a great abuse of words to call Harpy a wise man. He is of
15529,WISE MEN.,another species—_a cunning man_—who is to a wise man what an ape is to a
15530,WISE MEN.,human creature—a bad and contemptible resemblance.
15531,WISE MEN.,
15532,WISE MEN.,"_Ar._ He is very clever, though; is he not?"
15533,WISE MEN.,
15534,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ Harpy has a good natural understanding, a clear head, and a"
15535,WISE MEN.,cool temper; but his only end in life has been to raise a fortune by
15536,WISE MEN.,base and dishonest means. Being thoroughly acquainted with all the
15537,WISE MEN.,"tricks and artifices of the law, he employed his knowledge to take undue"
15538,WISE MEN.,advantages of all who intrusted him with the management of their
15539,WISE MEN.,"affairs; and under colour of assisting them, he contrived to get"
15540,WISE MEN.,"possession of all their property. Thus he has become extremely rich,"
15541,WISE MEN.,"lives in a great house with a number of servants, is even visited by"
15542,WISE MEN.,"persons of rank, yet is universally detested and despised, and has not a"
15543,WISE MEN.,"friend in the world. He is conscious of this, and is wretched. Suspicion"
15544,WISE MEN.,"and remorse continually prey upon his mind. Of all whom he has cheated,"
15545,WISE MEN.,he has deceived himself the most; and has proved himself as much a fool
15546,WISE MEN.,"in the end he has pursued, as a knave in the means."
15547,WISE MEN.,
15548,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ Are not men of great learning and knowledge wise men?
15549,WISE MEN.,
15550,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ They are so, if that knowledge and learning are employed to"
15551,WISE MEN.,make them happier and more useful. But it too often happens that their
15552,WISE MEN.,speculations are of a kind neither beneficial to themselves nor to
15553,WISE MEN.,others; and they often neglect to regulate their tempers while they
15554,WISE MEN.,improve their understandings. Some men of great learning have been the
15555,WISE MEN.,"most arrogant and quarrelsome of mortals, and as foolish and absurd in"
15556,WISE MEN.,their conduct as the most untaught of their species.
15557,WISE MEN.,
15558,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ But are not a philosopher and a wise man the same thing?
15559,WISE MEN.,
15560,WISE MEN.,_Mr. C._ A philosopher is properly a _lover of wisdom_; and if he
15561,WISE MEN.,"searches after it with a right disposition, he will probably find it"
15562,WISE MEN.,"oftener than other men. But he must practise as well as know, in order"
15563,WISE MEN.,to be truly wise.
15564,WISE MEN.,
15565,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ I have read of the seven wise men of Greece. What were they?
15566,WISE MEN.,
15567,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ They were men distinguished for their knowledge and talents,"
15568,WISE MEN.,"and some of them for their virtue, too. But wiser than them all was"
15569,WISE MEN.,"Socrates, whose chief praise it was that he turned philosophy from vain"
15570,WISE MEN.,"and fruitless disputation to the regulation of life and manners, and"
15571,WISE MEN.,that he was himself a great example of the wisdom he taught.
15572,WISE MEN.,
15573,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ Have we had any person lately very remarkable for wisdom?
15574,WISE MEN.,
15575,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ In my opinion, few wiser men have ever existed than the late"
15576,WISE MEN.,"Dr. Franklin, the American. From the low station of journeyman-printer"
15577,WISE MEN.,to the elevated one of ambassador plenipotentiary from his country to
15578,WISE MEN.,"the court of France, he always distinguished himself by sagacity in"
15579,WISE MEN.,"discovering, and good sense in practising, what was most beneficial to"
15580,WISE MEN.,"himself and others. He was a great natural philosopher, and made some"
15581,WISE MEN.,very brilliant discoveries; but it was ever his favourite purpose to
15582,WISE MEN.,"turn everything to use, and to extract some practical advantage from his"
15583,WISE MEN.,"speculations. He thoroughly understood _common life_, and all that"
15584,WISE MEN.,conduces to its comfort; and he has left behind him treasures of
15585,WISE MEN.,"domestic wisdom, superior, perhaps, to any of the boasted maxims of"
15586,WISE MEN.,"antiquity. He never let slip any opportunity of improving his knowledge,"
15587,WISE MEN.,whether of great things or of small; and was equally ready to converse
15588,WISE MEN.,with a day-labourer and a prime-minister upon topics from which he might
15589,WISE MEN.,"derive instruction. He rose to wealth, but obtained it by honourable"
15590,WISE MEN.,"means. He prolonged his life by temperance to a great age, and enjoyed"
15591,WISE MEN.,"it to the last. Few men knew more than he, and none employed knowledge"
15592,WISE MEN.,to better purposes.
15593,WISE MEN.,
15594,WISE MEN.,"_Ar._ A man, then, I suppose, cannot be wise without knowing a great"
15595,WISE MEN.,deal?
15596,WISE MEN.,
15597,WISE MEN.,"_Mr. C._ If he knows everything belonging to his station, it is wisdom"
15598,WISE MEN.,enough; and a peasant may be as truly wise in his place as a statesman
15599,WISE MEN.,"or a legislator. You remember that fable of Gay, in which a shepherd"
15600,WISE MEN.,gives lessons of wisdom to a philosopher.
15601,WISE MEN.,
15602,WISE MEN.,_Ar._ O yes—it begins:—
15603,WISE MEN.,
15604,WISE MEN.,“Remote from cities lived a swain.”
15605,WISE MEN.,
15606,WISE MEN.,_Mr. C._ True. He is represented as drawing all his maxims of conduct
15607,WISE MEN.,"from observation of brute animals. And they, indeed, have universally"
15608,WISE MEN.,"that character of wisdom, of pursuing the ends best suited to them by"
15609,WISE MEN.,the properest means. But this is owing to the impulse of unerring
15610,WISE MEN.,"instinct. Man has reason for his guide, and his wisdom can only be the"
15611,WISE MEN.,consequence of the right use of his reason. This will lead him to
15612,WISE MEN.,virtue. Thus the fable we have been mentioning rightly concludes with—
15613,WISE MEN.,
15614,WISE MEN.,"“’Thy fame is just,’ the sage replies;"
15615,WISE MEN.,‘Thy _virtue_ proves thee _truly wise_.’”

15625,A FRIEND IN NEED.,A FRIEND IN NEED.
15626,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15627,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15628,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"George Cornish, a native of London, was brought up to the sea. After"
15629,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"making several voyages to the East Indies in the capacity of mate, he"
15630,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"obtained the command of a ship in the country-trade there, and passed"
15631,A FRIEND IN NEED.,many years of his life in sailing from one port to another of the
15632,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"Company’s different settlements, and residing at intervals on shore with"
15633,A FRIEND IN NEED.,the superintendence of their commercial concerns. Having by these means
15634,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"raised a moderate fortune, and being now beyond the meridian of life, he"
15635,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"felt a strong desire of returning to his native country, and seeing his"
15636,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"family and friends, concerning whom he had received no tidings for a"
15637,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"long time. He realized his property, settled his affairs, and taking his"
15638,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"passage for England, arrived in the Downs after an absence of sixteen"
15639,A FRIEND IN NEED.,years.
15640,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15641,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"He immediately repaired to London, and went to the house of an only"
15642,A FRIEND IN NEED.,brother whom he had left possessed of a genteel place in a public
15643,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"office. He found that his brother was dead, and the family broken up;"
15644,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and he was directed to the house of one of his nieces, who was married"
15645,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and settled at a small distance from town. On making himself known, he"
15646,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"was received with great respect and affection by the married niece, and"
15647,A FRIEND IN NEED.,a single sister who resided with her; to which good reception the idea
15648,A FRIEND IN NEED.,of his bringing back with him a large fortune did not a little
15649,A FRIEND IN NEED.,contribute. They pressed him in the most urgent manner to take up his
15650,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"abode there, and omitted nothing that could testify their dutiful regard"
15651,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to so near a relation. On his part, he was sincerely glad to see them,"
15652,A FRIEND IN NEED.,and presented them with some valuable Indian commodities which he had
15653,A FRIEND IN NEED.,brought with him. They soon fell into conversation concerning the family
15654,A FRIEND IN NEED.,events that had taken place during his long absence. Mutual condolences
15655,A FRIEND IN NEED.,passed on the death of the father; the mother had been dead long before.
15656,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"The captain, in the warmth of his heart, declared his intention of"
15657,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"befriending the survivors of the family, and his wishes of seeing the"
15658,A FRIEND IN NEED.,second sister as comfortably settled in the world as the first seemed to
15659,A FRIEND IN NEED.,be.
15660,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15661,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"“But,” said he, “are you two the only ones left? What is become of my"
15662,A FRIEND IN NEED.,little smiling playfellow Amelia? I remember her as if it were
15663,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"yesterday, coming behind my chair, and giving me a sly pull, and then"
15664,A FRIEND IN NEED.,running away that I might follow her for a kiss. I should be sorry if
15665,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"anything had happened to her.”—“Alas! sir,” said the eldest niece, “she"
15666,A FRIEND IN NEED.,has been the cause of an infinite deal of trouble to her friends! She
15667,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"was always a giddy girl, and her misconduct has proved her ruin. It"
15668,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"would be happy if we could all forget her!”—“What, then,” said the"
15669,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"uncle, “has she dishonoured herself? Poor creature!”—“I cannot say,”"
15670,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"replied the niece, “that she has done so in the worst sense of the word;"
15671,A FRIEND IN NEED.,but she has disgraced herself and her family by a hasty foolish match
15672,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"with one beneath her, and it is ended, as might have been expected, in"
15673,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"poverty and wretchedness.”—“I am glad,” returned the captain, “that it"
15674,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"is no worse; for though I much disapprove of improper matches, yet young"
15675,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"girls may fall into still greater evils, and where there is no crime,"
15676,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"there can be no irreparable disgrace. But who was the man, and what did"
15677,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"my brother say to it?”—“Why, sir, I cannot say but it was partly my"
15678,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"father’s own fault; for he took a sort of liking to the young man, who"
15679,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"was a drawing-master employed in the family, and would not forbid him"
15680,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"the house, after we had informed him of the danger of an attachment"
15681,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"between Amelia and him. So when it was too late, he fell into a violent"
15682,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"passion about it, which had no other effect than to drive the girl"
15683,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"directly into her lover’s arms. They married, and soon fell into"
15684,A FRIEND IN NEED.,difficulties. My father of course would do nothing for them; and when he
15685,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"died, he not only disinherited her, but made us promise no longer to"
15686,A FRIEND IN NEED.,look upon her as a sister.”—“And you _did_ make that promise?” said the
15687,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"captain, in a tone of surprise and displeasure. “We could not disobey"
15688,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"our parent,” replied the other sister; “but we have several times sent"
15689,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"her relief in her necessities, though it was improper for us to see"
15690,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"her.”—“And pray, what has become of her at last—where is she"
15691,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"now?”—“Really, she and her husband have shifted their lodgings so often,"
15692,A FRIEND IN NEED.,that it is sometime since we heard anything about them.”—“Sometime! how
15693,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"long?”—“Perhaps half a year or more.”—“Poor outcast!” cried the captain,"
15694,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"in a sort of muttered half-voice; “_I_ have made no promise, however, to"
15695,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"renounce thee. Be pleased, madam,” he continued, addressing himself"
15696,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"gravely to the married niece, “to favour me with the last direction you"
15697,A FRIEND IN NEED.,had to this unfortunate sister.” She blushed and looked confused; and at
15698,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"length, after a good deal of searching, presented it to her uncle. “But,"
15699,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"my dear sir,” said she, “you will not think of leaving us to-day? My"
15700,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"servant shall make all the inquiries you choose, and save you the"
15701,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"trouble; and to-morrow you can ride to town, and do as you think"
15702,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"proper.”—“My good niece,” said the captain, “I am but an indifferent"
15703,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"sleeper, and I am afraid things would run in my head and keep me awake."
15704,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"Besides, I am naturally impatient, and love to do my business myself."
15705,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"You will excuse me.”—So saying, he took up his hat, and without much"
15706,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"ceremony, went out of the house, and took the road to town on foot,"
15707,A FRIEND IN NEED.,leaving his two nieces somewhat disconcerted.
15708,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15709,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"When he arrived, he went without delay to the place mentioned, which was"
15710,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"a by-street near Soho. The people who kept the lodgings informed him,"
15711,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"that the persons he inquired after had left them several months, and"
15712,A FRIEND IN NEED.,they did not know what was become of them. This threw the captain into
15713,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"great perplexity; but while he was considering what he should do next,"
15714,A FRIEND IN NEED.,the woman of the house recollected that Mr. Bland (that was the
15715,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"drawing-master’s name) had been employed at a certain school, where"
15716,A FRIEND IN NEED.,information about him might possibly be obtained. Captain Cornish
15717,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"hastened away to the place, and was informed by the master of the school"
15718,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"that such a man had, indeed, been engaged there, but had ceased to"
15719,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"attend for some time past. “He was a very well-behaved, industrious"
15720,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"young man,” added the master, “but in distressed circumstances, which"
15721,A FRIEND IN NEED.,prevented him from making that genteel appearance which we expect in all
15722,A FRIEND IN NEED.,who attend our school; so I was obliged to dismiss him. It was a great
15723,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"force upon my _feelings_, I assure you, sir, to do so; but you know the"
15724,A FRIEND IN NEED.,thing could not be helped.” The captain eyed him with indignant
15725,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"contempt, and said, “I suppose, then, sir, your _feelings_ never"
15726,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"suffered you to inquire where this poor creature lodged, or what became"
15727,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"of him afterward?”—“As to that,” replied the master, “every man knows"
15728,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"his own business best, and my time is fully taken up with my own"
15729,A FRIEND IN NEED.,concerns; but I believe I have a note of the lodgings he then
15730,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"occupied—here it is.” The captain took it, and turning on his heel,"
15731,A FRIEND IN NEED.,withdrew in silence.
15732,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15733,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"He posted away to the place, but there, too, had the mortification of"
15734,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"learning that he was too late. The people, however, told him that they"
15735,A FRIEND IN NEED.,believed he might find the family he was seeking in a neighbouring
15736,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"alley, at a lodging up three pair of stairs. The captain’s heart sunk"
15737,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"within him; however, taking a boy as a guide, he proceeded immediately"
15738,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to the spot. On going up the narrow creaking staircase, he met a man"
15739,A FRIEND IN NEED.,coming down with a bed on his shoulders. At the top of the landing stood
15740,A FRIEND IN NEED.,another with a bundle of blankets and sheets. A woman with a child in
15741,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"her arms was expostulating with him, and he heard her exclaim, “Cruel!"
15742,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"not to leave me _one_ bed for myself and my poor children!”—“Stop,” said"
15743,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"the captain to the man, “set down those things.” The man hesitated. The"
15744,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"captain renewed his command in a peremptory tone, and then advanced"
15745,A FRIEND IN NEED.,towards the woman. They looked earnestly at each other. Through her pale
15746,A FRIEND IN NEED.,and emaciated features he saw something of his little smiler; and at
15747,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"length, in a faint voice, he addressed her, “Are you Amelia"
15748,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"Cornish?”—“That _was_ my name,” she replied. “I am your uncle,” he"
15749,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"cried, clasping her in his arms, and sobbing as if his heart would"
15750,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"break. “My uncle!” said she, and fainted. He was just able to set her"
15751,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"down on the only remaining chair, and take her child from her. Two other"
15752,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"young children came running up, and began to scream with terror. Amelia"
15753,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"recovered herself. “Oh, sir, what a situation you see me in!”—“A"
15754,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"situation, indeed!” said he. “Poor forsaken creature! but you have _one_"
15755,A FRIEND IN NEED.,friend left!”
15756,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15757,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"He then asked what was become of her husband? She told him, that having"
15758,A FRIEND IN NEED.,fatigued himself with walking every day to a great distance for a little
15759,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"employment that scarcely afforded them bread, he had fallen ill, and was"
15760,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"now in an hospital, and that after having been obliged to sell most of"
15761,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"their little furniture and clothes for present subsistence, their"
15762,A FRIEND IN NEED.,landlord had just seized their only remaining bed for some arrears of
15763,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"rent. The captain immediately discharged the debt, and causing the bed"
15764,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to be brought up again, dismissed the man. He then entered into a"
15765,A FRIEND IN NEED.,conversation with his niece about the events that had befallen her.
15766,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"“Alas! sir,” said she, “I am sensible I was greatly to blame in"
15767,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"disobeying my father, and leaving his roof as I did; but perhaps"
15768,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"something might be alleged in my excuse—at least, years of calamity and"
15769,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"distress may be an expiation. As to my husband, however, he has never"
15770,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"given me the least cause of complaint—he has ever been kind and good,"
15771,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and what we have suffered has been through misfortune, and not fault. To"
15772,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"be sure, when we married, we did not know how a family was to be"
15773,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"maintained. His was a poor employment, and sickness and other accidents"
15774,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"soon brought us to a state of poverty, from which we could never"
15775,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"retrieve ourselves. He, poor man! was never idle when he could help it,"
15776,A FRIEND IN NEED.,and denied himself every indulgence in order to provide for the wants of
15777,A FRIEND IN NEED.,me and the children. I did my part too as well as I was able. But my
15778,A FRIEND IN NEED.,father’s unrelenting severity made me quite heart-broken; and though my
15779,A FRIEND IN NEED.,sisters two or three times gave us a little relief in our pressing
15780,A FRIEND IN NEED.,necessities—for nothing else could have made me ask in the manner I
15781,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"did—yet they would never permit me to see them, and for some time past"
15782,A FRIEND IN NEED.,have entirely abandoned us. I thought Heaven had abandoned us too. The
15783,A FRIEND IN NEED.,hour of extremest distress was come; but you have been sent for our
15784,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"comfort.”—“And your comfort, please God! I will be,” cried the captain"
15785,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"with energy. “You are my own dear child, and your little ones shall be"
15786,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"mine too. Dry up your tears—better days I hope, are approaching.”"
15787,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15788,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"Evening was now coming on, and it was too late to think of changing"
15789,A FRIEND IN NEED.,lodgings. The captain procured a neighbour to go out for some provisions
15790,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and other necessaries, and then took his leave, with a promise of being"
15791,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"with his niece early the next morning. Indeed, as he proposed going to"
15792,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"pay a visit to her husband, she was far from wishing to detain him"
15793,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"longer. He went directly thence to the hospital, and having got access"
15794,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to the apothecary, begged to be informed of the real state of his"
15795,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"patient, Bland. The apothecary told him that he laboured under a slow"
15796,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"fever, attended with extreme dejection of spirits, but that there were"
15797,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"no signs of urgent danger. “If you will allow me to see him,” said the"
15798,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"captain, “I believe I shall be able to administer a cordial more"
15799,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"effectual, perhaps, than all your medicines.” He was shown up to the"
15800,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"ward where the poor man lay, and, seated by his bedside, “Mr. Bland,”"
15801,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"said he, “I am a stranger to you, but I come to bring you some news of"
15802,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"your family.” The sick man roused himself, as it were, from a stupor,"
15803,A FRIEND IN NEED.,and fixed his eyes in silence on the captain. He proceeded—“Perhaps you
15804,A FRIEND IN NEED.,may have heard of an uncle that your wife had in the East Indies—he is
15805,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"come home, and—and—I am he.” Upon this he eagerly stretched out his"
15806,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"hand, and taking that of Bland, which was thrust out of the bedclothes"
15807,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to meet it, gave it a cordial shake. The sick man’s eyes glistened—he"
15808,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"grasped the captain’s hand with all his remaining strength, and drawing"
15809,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"it to his mouth, kissed it with fervour. All he could say was, “God"
15810,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"bless you!—be kind to poor Amelia!”—“I will—I will,” cried the captain,"
15811,A FRIEND IN NEED.,“I will be a father to you all. Cheer up—keep up your spirits—all will
15812,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"be well.” He then, with a kind look and another shake of the hand,"
15813,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"wished him a good night, and left the poor man lightened at once of half"
15814,A FRIEND IN NEED.,his disease.
15815,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15816,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"The captain went home to the coffee-house where he lodged, got a light"
15817,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"supper, and went early to bed. After meditating sometime with heartfelt"
15818,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"satisfaction on the work of the day, he fell into a sweet sleep, which"
15819,A FRIEND IN NEED.,lasted till daybreak. The next morning early he rose and sallied forth
15820,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"in search of furnished lodgings. After some inquiry, he met with a"
15821,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"commodious set, in a pleasant airy situation, for which he agreed. He"
15822,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"then drove to Amelia, and found her and her children neat and clean, and"
15823,A FRIEND IN NEED.,as well dressed as their poor wardrobe would admit. He embraced them
15824,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"with the utmost affection, and rejoiced Amelia’s heart with a favourable"
15825,A FRIEND IN NEED.,account of her husband. He then told them to prepare for a ride with
15826,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"him. The children were overjoyed at the proposal, and they accompanied"
15827,A FRIEND IN NEED.,him down to the coach in high spirits. Amelia scarcely knew what to
15828,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"think or expect. They drove first to a warehouse for ready-made linen,"
15829,A FRIEND IN NEED.,where the captain made Amelia furnish herself with a complete set of
15830,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"everything necessary for present use for the children and herself, not"
15831,A FRIEND IN NEED.,forgetting some shirts for her husband. Thence they went to a clothes
15832,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"shop, where the little boy was supplied with a jacket and trowsers, a"
15833,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"hat and great coat, and the girl with another great coat and a"
15834,A FRIEND IN NEED.,bonnet—both were made as happy as happy could be. They were next all
15835,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"furnished with new shoes. In short, they had not proceeded far, before"
15836,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"the mother and three children were all in complete new habiliments,"
15837,A FRIEND IN NEED.,decent but not fine; while the old ones were all tied up in a great
15838,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"bundle, and destined for some family still poorer than they had been."
15839,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15840,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"The captain then drove to the lodgings he had taken, and which he had"
15841,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"directed to be put in thorough order. He led Amelia upstairs, who knew"
15842,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"not whither she was going. He brought her into a handsome parlour, and"
15843,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"seated her in a chair. “This, my dear,” said he, “is your house. I hope"
15844,A FRIEND IN NEED.,you will let me now and then come and see you in it?” Amelia turned pale
15845,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and could not speak. At length, a flood of tears came to her relief, and"
15846,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"she suddenly threw herself at her uncle’s feet, and poured out thanks"
15847,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and blessings in a broken voice. He raised her, and kindly kissing her"
15848,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and her children, slipped a purse of gold into her hand, and hurried"
15849,A FRIEND IN NEED.,downstairs.
15850,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15851,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"He next went to the hospital, and found Mr. Bland sitting up in bed, and"
15852,A FRIEND IN NEED.,taking some food with apparent pleasure. He sat down by him. “God bless
15853,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"you! sir,” said Bland, “I see now it is all a reality, and not a dream."
15854,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"Your figure has been haunting me all night, and I have scarcely been"
15855,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"able to satisfy myself whether I had really seen and spoke to you, or"
15856,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"whether it was a fit of delirium. Yet my spirits have been lightened,"
15857,A FRIEND IN NEED.,and I have now been eating with a relish I have not experienced for many
15858,A FRIEND IN NEED.,days past. But may I ask how is my poor Amelia and my little
15859,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"ones?”—“They are well and happy, my good friend;” said the captain, “and"
15860,A FRIEND IN NEED.,I hope you will soon be so along with them.” The apothecary came up and
15861,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"felt his patient’s pulse. “You are a lucky doctor, indeed, sir,” said he"
15862,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"to Captain Cornish, “you have cured the poor man of his fever. His pulse"
15863,A FRIEND IN NEED.,is as calm as my own.” The captain consulted him about the safety of
15864,A FRIEND IN NEED.,removing him; and the apothecary thought that there would be no hazard
15865,A FRIEND IN NEED.,in doing it that very day. The captain waited the arrival of the
15866,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"physician, who confirmed the same opinion. A sedan-chair was procured,"
15867,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"and full directions being obtained for the future treatment, with the"
15868,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"physician’s promise to look after him, the captain walked before the"
15869,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"chair, to the new lodgings. On the knock at the door, Amelia looked out"
15870,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"of the window, and seeing the chair, ran down, and met her uncle and"
15871,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"husband in the passage. The poor man, not knowing where he was, and"
15872,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"gazing wildly around him, was carried upstairs and placed upon a good"
15873,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"bed, while his wife and children assembled around it. A glass of wine"
15874,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"brought by the people of the house restored him to his recollection,"
15875,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"when a most tender scene ensued, which the uncle closed as soon as he"
15876,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"could, for fear of too much agitating the yet feeble organs of the sick"

15878,A FRIEND IN NEED.,
15879,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"By Amelia’s constant attention, assisted by proper help, Mr. Bland"
15880,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"shortly recovered; and the whole family lost their sickly, emaciated"
15881,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"appearance, and became healthy and happy. The kind uncle was never long"
15882,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"absent from them, and was always received with looks of pleasure and"
15883,A FRIEND IN NEED.,gratitude that penetrated his very soul. He obtained for Mr. Bland a
15884,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"good situation in the exercise of his profession, and took Amelia and"
15885,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"her children into his special care. As to his other nieces, though he"
15886,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"did not entirely break off his connexion with them, but, on the"
15887,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"contrary, showed them occasional marks of the kindness of a relation,"
15888,A FRIEND IN NEED.,yet he could never look upon them with true cordiality. And as they had
15889,A FRIEND IN NEED.,so well kept their promise to their father of never treating Amelia as a
15890,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"sister, while in her afflicted state, he took care not to tempt them to"
15891,A FRIEND IN NEED.,"break it, now she was in a favoured and prosperous condition."

15905,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,
15906,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"In a certain district of the globe things one year went so ill, that"
15907,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"almost the whole race of living beings, animals and vegetables, carried"
15908,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,their lamentations and complaints to their common mother _the Earth_.
15909,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,
15910,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"First came _Man_. “O Earth,” said he, “how can you behold unmoved the"
15911,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,intolerable calamities of your favourite offspring! Heaven shuts up all
15912,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"the sources of its benignity to us, and showers plagues and pestilence"
15913,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,on our heads—storms tear to pieces all the works of human labour—the
15914,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,elements of fire and water seem let loose to devour us—and in the midst
15915,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,of all these evils some demon possesses us with a rage of worrying and
15916,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,destroying one another; so that the whole species seems doomed to
15917,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"perish. O, intercede in our behalf, or else receive us again into your"
15918,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"maternal womb, and hide us from the sight of these accumulated"
15919,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,distresses!”
15920,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,
15921,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"The other animals then spoke by their deputies, the horse, the ox, and"
15922,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"the sheep. “O pity, mother Earth, those of your children that repose on"
15923,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"your breast, and derive their subsistence from your foodful bosom! We"
15924,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"are parched with drought, we are scorched by lightning, we are beaten by"
15925,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"pitiless tempests, salubrious vegetables refuse to nourish us, we"
15926,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"languish under disease, and the race of men treat us with unusual"
15927,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"rigour. Never, without speedy succour, can we survive to another year.”"
15928,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,
15929,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"The vegetables next, those that form the verdant carpet of the earth,"
15930,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"that cover the waving fields of harvest, and that spread their lofty"
15931,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"branches in the air, sent forth their complaint:—“O, our general mother,"
15932,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"to whose breast we cleave, and whose vital juices we drain, have"
15933,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"compassion upon us! See, how we wither and droop under the baleful gales"
15934,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,that sweep over us—how we thirst in vain for the gentle dew of
15935,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,Heaven—how immense tribes of noxious insects pierce and devour us—how
15936,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"the famishing flocks and herds tear us up by the roots—and how men,"
15937,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"through mutual spite, lay waste and destroy us, while yet immature."
15938,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"Already whole nations of us are desolated, and unless you save us,"
15939,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,another year will witness our total destruction.”
15940,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,
15941,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"“My children,” said Earth, “I have now existed some thousand years; and"
15942,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,scarcely one of them has passed in which similar complaints have not
15943,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"risen from one quarter or another. Nevertheless, everything has remained"
15944,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"in nearly the same state, and no species of created beings has been"
15945,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,finally lost. The injuries of one year are repaired by the gifts of the
15946,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"succeeding one. The growing vegetables may be blasted, but the seeds of"
15947,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"others lie secure in my bosom, ready to receive the vital influence of"
15948,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"more favourable seasons. Animals may be thinned by want and disease, but"
15949,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"a remnant is always left, in whom survives the principle of future"
15950,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"increase. As to man, who suffers not only from natural causes, but from"
15951,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"the effects of his own follies and vices, his miseries rouse within him"
15952,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"the latent powers of remedy, and bring him to his reason again; while"
15953,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,experience continually goes along with him to improve his means of
15954,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"happiness, if he will but listen to its dictates. Have patience, then,"
15955,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"my children! You were born to suffer, as well as to enjoy, and you must"
15956,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,submit to your lot. But console yourselves with the thought that you
15957,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,"have a kind Master above, who created you for benevolent purposes, and"
15958,EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.,will not withhold his protection when you stand most in need of it.”

15964,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
15965,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
15966,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"At a small house in a court in London, there resided for many years, a"
15967,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"person beyond the middle age of life, whose family consisted of one male"
15968,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"and one female servant, both of long standing. He was of grave and"
15969,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,somewhat pensive aspect. His dress was perfectly plain and never varied.
15970,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"He wore his own gray hair, and his general appearance resembled that of"
15971,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"a Quaker, though without the peculiarities of that sect. He was not"
15972,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,known to his neighbours but by sight. They frequently observed him go
15973,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"out and come in, almost always on foot, even in the worst weather. He"
15974,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"did not appear to keep any company, and his mode of life seemed to be"
15975,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,very uniform. He paid ready money to the few tradespeople with whom he
15976,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"dealt, and never made any one call a second time for dues and taxes. In"
15977,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"some charitable collections that were set on foot in the parish, he gave"
15978,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"as much as was expected from him, and no more. He returned the"
15979,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"salutation of the hat to those who gave it him, but never exceeded a"
15980,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,word or two in conversation with his neighbours. His religion and
15981,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,political sentiments were entirely unknown. The general notion about him
15982,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"was, either that he was a reduced gentleman, obliged to live privately,"
15983,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"or one concerned in some private money transactions, and bent upon"
15984,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"hoarding a fortune. His name, from the parish-books, appeared to be"
15985,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,_Mortimer_.
15986,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
15987,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"After he had thus lived a long time, a train of accidental circumstances"
15988,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"occurred within a short space, which fully displayed his character."
15989,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
15990,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"In a blind alley at some little distance, there lived a poor widow who"
15991,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"had several children, the eldest a beautiful girl of eighteen. The woman"
15992,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"was very industrious, and supported her family by taking in work in"
15993,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"which her children assisted. It happened that some of them, and at"
15994,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"length herself, fell ill of a fever, which continued so long as to"
15995,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,reduce them to great distress. She was obliged to part with many things
15996,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"for a present subsistence; and, on their recovery, a half-year’s rent"
15997,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"being due which she was unable to pay, the landlord threatened to seize"
15998,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"the remainder of her goods, and turn her and her children into the"
15999,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"street. He intimated, however, that it might be in the power of the"
16000,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,eldest daughter to settle accounts with him in a less difficult manner;
16001,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,but his hints were treated with virtuous disdain. The girl had a
16002,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"faithful lover, a journeyman-carpenter, who, during the illness of the"
16003,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"family, contributed half his wages to their support, and now by promises"
16004,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"endeavoured to mollify the landlord, but in vain. He was coming"
16005,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,disconsolately one night after work to pay his usual visit to the
16006,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"distressed family, when he observed Mr. Mortimer, whom he knew, having"
16007,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"worked at his house, stealing upstairs to the widow’s lodging. The"
16008,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,suspicion natural to a lover led him to follow. He saw him open the
16009,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"door, and he entered unperceived after him. Mr. Mortimer walked into the"
16010,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,room where were all the poor family; the mother and eldest daughter
16011,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"weeping over the rest. They showed much surprise at his approach, and"
16012,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"still more, when, going up to the widow, he put a purse of guineas into"
16013,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"her hand, and immediately turned about and went away. “What angel from"
16014,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"heaven,” cried the poor woman, “has brought me this? Run after him,"
16015,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"daughter, and thank him on your knees!” She ran, but he was got almost"
16016,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"down stairs. “I know him,” cried the journeyman-carpenter, making his"
16017,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"appearance, “’t is Mr. Mortimer.”"
16018,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16019,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,In a chamber of a house in an obscure part of the town a gang of
16020,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,clippers and coiners were detected by the officers of justice. A poor
16021,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"lame fellow, who lived in the adjoining room, was brought along with the"
16022,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"rest for examination. “Well,” said one of the justices, “and who are"
16023,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,you?”
16024,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16025,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Please your worship, I am a poor man who have lost the use of my limbs"
16026,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,these seven years.”
16027,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16028,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,“And how have you been supported all that time?”
16029,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16030,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Why, sir, I might have starved long ago, as I have no settlement in"
16031,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"these parts, and the masters for whom I worked would do nothing for me,"
16032,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,but a very good gentleman has been so kind as to give me five shillings
16033,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,a week for these six years.”
16034,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16035,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Ay! you were lucky, indeed, to light upon such a kind gentleman. Pray,"
16036,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,what is his name?”
16037,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16038,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“I don’t know it, your worship.”"
16039,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16040,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“No!—that’s very strange, that you should not know the name of the"
16041,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,person who keeps you from starving. But where does he live?”
16042,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16043,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Indeed, sir, I don’t know that neither. I know nothing at all of him"
16044,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,but the good he does me.”
16045,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16046,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Why, how came you at first to be acquainted with him?”"
16047,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16048,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“I had just been turned out of the hospital incurable, and was thinking"
16049,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"that nothing remained for me but begging and starving in the streets,"
16050,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,when the gentleman came up to my poor lodging (God knows how he found
16051,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"it) and gave me a guinea to buy some necessaries, and told me, if I"
16052,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"would do what little I could to maintain myself, he would take care that"
16053,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"I should not want. And ever since, either he or his man has brought me a"
16054,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,crown every week.”
16055,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16056,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“This story, my friend, will hardly pass. But tell me what trade you"
16057,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,worked at before you lost the use of your limbs?”
16058,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16059,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Plating and gilding, your worship.”"
16060,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16061,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,“O! ho! Then you understand working in metals! You must be kept till you
16062,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,give a more probable account of yourself.”
16063,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16064,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"The poor man in vain protested that every word he had said was true, and"
16065,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,offered to bring proof of his honesty and sobriety from his neighbours;
16066,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,he was ordered to a place of confinement till further examination. The
16067,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"constable was taking him thither, when by good fortune he chanced to spy"
16068,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"his benefactor crossing the street just before him. He called aloud, and"
16069,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"requested him to stop; and then in a piteous tone relating his story,"
16070,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"entreated him to go back with them to the justice, and bear witness in"
16071,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,his behalf. This could not be refused. They were admitted into a crowded
16072,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"hall, when the constable told the cause of his return. All eyes were"
16073,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"turned upon the gentleman, who was desired to give his name. “It is"
16074,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Mortimer,” said he. He then, in a few words, mentioned, that having some"
16075,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,years ago come to the knowledge of the poor man’s character and
16076,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"distress, he had since taken care of him."
16077,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16078,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“’Tis enough, sir,” said a gentleman at the board; “I have the honour of"
16079,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"being a neighbour of yours, but I did not before know _what_ a neighbour"
16080,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,I had.” Mr. Mortimer bowed and retired. The poor fellow was discharged.
16081,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16082,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Two maiden sisters, daughters of a very worthy tradesman, whom"
16083,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"misfortunes had reduced to poverty, and who died of a broken heart, were"
16084,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"for several years supported by an annuity of forty pounds each, which"
16085,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"came from an unknown quarter. The mode in which they received it was,"
16086,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"that twice a year, at night, a person knocked at the door of their"
16087,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"lodging, which was upon a second floor, and delivered into the hands of"
16088,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"one of them a parcel containing two twenty-pound bank-notes, with a"
16089,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"paper on which was written, “To be continued—no inquiry!” Though this"
16090,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,injunction prevented them from taking any steps to detect their
16091,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"benefactor, yet many were the conjectures which, between themselves,"
16092,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"they made on this subject, but without attaining to the least"
16093,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"probability. One night, about the time that the above-related events"
16094,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"happened, the person, who came as usual to deliver the notes, on hastily"
16095,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"turning round to retire, fell from the top of the stairs to the bottom."
16096,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"The lady shrieked out, and running down, found the man lying senseless"
16097,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"and bloody. Help was procured, and he was taken up to their lodging. A"
16098,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"surgeon was immediately sent for, who, by bleeding and other means,"
16099,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"restored him to his senses. As soon as the man recovered his speech, he"
16100,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,requested to be taken to his master’s. “Who is your master?” cried the
16101,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"surgeon; “Mr. Mortimer, of —— Court.”—“What!” exclaimed the elder of the"
16102,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"ladies, “Mr. Mortimer, my poor father’s greatest creditor—is it he to"
16103,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,whom we have been so long indebted for everything?” The man laid his
16104,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"finger on his lips, and she was silent, but not a word had escaped the"
16105,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"surgeon. The servant was sent away in a coach, the surgeon accompanying"
16106,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"him. They arrived at Mr. Mortimer’s, where, after the confusion"
16107,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"occasioned by the accident had subsided, the surgeon found that the face"
16108,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,of both master and man were familiar to him. “I am sure I am not
16109,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"mistaken,” said he, “you are the gentleman who so charitably took care"
16110,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"of the poor fellow that had such a bad broken leg in this neighbourhood,"
16111,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,and paid me for my attendance.” Mr. Mortimer assented. “Here is a double
16112,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"discovery,” said the surgeon to himself; and on taking his leave,"
16113,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Permit me to assure you, sir,” he cried, “that I venerate you beyond"
16114,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,any other human being!”—At the corner of the court where Mr. Mortimer
16115,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"resided was a shoemaker’s shop, kept by a man who had a wife and five"
16116,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"children. He was one of the most industrious creatures breathing, and"
16117,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"with great exertions was just able to maintain decently his family, of"
16118,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,whom he was extremely fond. A younger brother of his had come up out of
16119,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"the country, and obtained a place in a public office, for which it was"
16120,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,necessary to give security; and he had prevailed upon his brother to
16121,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,enter into a joint bond with him for two hundred pounds. The brother
16122,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"fell into vicious courses, and at length absconded with all the money he"
16123,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,was intrusted with. The shoemaker was now called upon to pay the
16124,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"forfeiture of his bond, which, on account of bad debts, and having been"
16125,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"lately drained of all his ready money to pay for leather, he was unable"
16126,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"to do; and, in consequence, was sent to jail. The distress this brought"
16127,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"upon the family was aggravated by the condition of his wife, who was"
16128,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,near lying-in; and their mutual affection was turned into a source of
16129,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"the bitterest grief. He had been about six weeks in prison, without any"
16130,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"prospect of release, all his friends and relations having been in vain"
16131,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"tried, when, one evening, the keeper who had treated him with much"
16132,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"compassion, came up to his room with pleasure in his countenance, and"
16133,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"said, “You are free.” The poor man could at first scarcely believe him,"
16134,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"but finding him persist in the truth of it, he almost fainted away"
16135,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,through surprise and joy. When he was sufficiently recovered to reflect
16136,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"on the matter, he was quite bewildered in conjecturing how it had been"
16137,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"brought about. He could only learn, that a discharge of the debt bad"
16138,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"been sent to the jail, and all the fees and expenses there paid by a"
16139,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"person whose name was unknown, but whose face they were well acquainted"
16140,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"with, as he had several times been on the same errand there before. “O!”"
16141,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"cried the shoemaker, “that I could but know my benefactor!” He hastened"
16142,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"home, where his unexpected appearance almost overwhelmed his poor"
16143,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"family. On talking over the business with his wife, he learned that Mr."
16144,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Mortimer’s servant had a few days before been at the shop, and had been"
16145,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,very particular in inquiring the cause and place of his confinement.
16146,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"This occasioned a strong suspicion, for Mr. Mortimer’s character now"
16147,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,came to be talked of; and soon after it was changed into certainty by a
16148,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"visit from the keeper of the prison, who acquainted the shoemaker, that"
16149,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,they had now discovered who his benefactor and that of so many others
16150,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,was; one of their people having chanced to be at the sessions-house when
16151,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,Mr. Mortimer appeared there in behalf of the lame man taken up on
16152,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"suspicion, and having recognised him to be the same person. The"
16153,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"shoemaker was overjoyed at this intelligence, but was still at a loss to"
16154,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,know in what manner he ought to express his gratitude. He was afraid of
16155,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"offending, by doing it in a public manner, as it had evidently been Mr."
16156,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,Mortimer’s intention to remain concealed; yet it was necessary that his
16157,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,heart should have some vent for its emotions. He took his wife and
16158,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"children, and went to Mr. Mortimer’s house, desiring to speak with him."
16159,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Being admitted into the study, the poor man began a speech which he had"
16160,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"prepared; but instead of going on, he burst into a fit of crying, fell"
16161,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"on his knees, seizing one hand of his benefactor, while his wife did the"
16162,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"same on the other side, and kissing them with the utmost fervency, both"
16163,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,in a broken voice implored endless blessings on his head. The children
16164,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"fell on their knees, too, and held up their little hands. Mr. Mortimer"
16165,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"was moved and remained awhile silent; at length, recollecting himself,"
16166,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Too much! too much!” he cried, “Go home, go home, my good people! God"
16167,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,bless you all!” and thus dismissed them.
16168,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16169,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,An old clergyman from the country came up to town on business about this
16170,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"time, and paid a visit to an intimate friend of the same profession."
16171,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"After some mutual greetings and inquiries, “Ah! my good friend,” said"
16172,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"the country clergyman, “our parish has undergone a blessed alteration"
16173,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,since you knew it! The principal estate was sold some years ago to a
16174,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"gentleman in London, who is one of those few that are never wearied in"
16175,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"well-doing. He built, in the first place, half a score neat cottages,"
16176,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,where all the industrious poor who are past labour are comfortably
16177,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,maintained at his expense. He endowed a free school for all the children
16178,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"of the parish without exception, where they are taught to read and"
16179,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"write, and some of the poorest are clothed. Every winter he orders the"
16180,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,baker to deliver twice a week a large loaf at the house of each cottager
16181,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,during the hard weather. He has frequently remitted his rents to poor
16182,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"tenants in bad seasons; and, in short, I should never have done were I"
16183,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,to enumerate all his deeds of charity. I myself have in various ways
16184,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"been much indebted to him, and I am well informed that he contributes"
16185,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,largely to the support of an aged dissenting minister in the parish. But
16186,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"what is singular, he is very shy of being seen, nor do we know anything"
16187,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"of his rank and profession, or his town residence; nay, I believe we"
16188,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"should not have learned his name, had not the purchase necessarily made"
16189,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,it public. It is Mortimer.”
16190,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16191,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Why,” said his friend, “I have a parishioner of that name; and from"
16192,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"what I have lately heard of him, I suspect him to be the man.”"
16193,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16194,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,“Could not I get a sight of him?” replied the first.
16195,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16196,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"“Probably you may,” said the other; and presently, seeing him cross the"
16197,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"court, he pointed him out."
16198,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16199,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,“Ah! that is the blessed man!” exclaimed the old clergyman in a rapture.
16200,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"And running out, he went up, grasped him eagerly by the hand, and poured"
16201,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,out the most affectionate wishes for his welfare.
16202,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16203,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,Mr. Mortimer now stood _completely detected_.
16204,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16205,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"The world, however, was not satisfied with the general knowledge of his"
16206,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,goodness and benevolence. Curiosity was at work to discover his
16207,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"connexions, habits, property, employment; in short, the whole personal"
16208,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"history of the man. One only friend, to whom he intrusted all the"
16209,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"secrets of his heart and life, thought fit, after he was removed from"
16210,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"this mortal state, to gratify the world in this particular."
16211,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16212,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Mr. Mortimer was a younger son of a respectable family in the country,"
16213,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"and came to London at an early age, to be educated for commercial life."
16214,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"In this he succeeded so well, that after going through the different"
16215,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"stages of clerk, partner, and principal, he found himself possessed of a"
16216,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,considerable fortune. For sometime he made that use of his wealth which
16217,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,persons who live within the bounds of what is called decency think
16218,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,permitted to them. But the common pleasures of the world palled daily
16219,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,more and more upon his taste. He found a void which could only be filled
16220,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,by reading and contemplation. He grew fond of taking enlarged views of
16221,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"mankind, their several conditions, characters, and destinations. He"
16222,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"compared the higher classes with the lower, the instructed with the"
16223,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"ignorant; above all, he examined _himself_, and inquired into the great"
16224,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,purpose for which he was brought into the world. In order to augment his
16225,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"sphere of knowledge, he resolved to visit foreign countries; and having"
16226,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"no family encumbrances, he drew his affairs into a small compass,"
16227,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"relinquished business, and went abroad. During a course of some years,"
16228,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"he was a wanderer through most countries of Europe, travelling chiefly"
16229,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"on foot, avoiding common routes, and mingling with the mass of the"
16230,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,people.
16231,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16232,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"He saw, abroad as well as at home, a great deal of misery; he saw"
16233,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,wretchedness everywhere close in the train of splendour—indigence by the
16234,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,side of prodigality—baseness under the foot of authority. He lamented
16235,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"the evils of the world; but whatever might be their original source, he"
16236,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,saw that man had within himself the power of remedying many of them. In
16237,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"exercising this power, all duty, all virtue seemed to consist. “This,"
16238,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"then,” said he, “must be the proper business of every man in this life."
16239,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,It is then _mine_; and how shall I best perform it?”
16240,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16241,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"Full of these meditations, he returned; and convinced that the great"
16242,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,inequality of rank and property is one principal cause (though a
16243,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"necessary one) of the ills of life, he resolved, as much as it lay in"
16244,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"his power, to counteract it. “How few things,” thought he, “are"
16245,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"necessary to my external comfort! Wholesome food, warm clothing, clean"
16246,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"lodging, a little waiting upon, and a few books. This is all that even"
16247,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"selfishness asks of me. Whose, then, is the superfluity?”"
16248,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16249,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,That he might at once get rid of the craving and burdensome demands
16250,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"which _opinion_ imposes, he took a house in a part of the town where his"
16251,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"name was unknown; and of all his former acquaintance, he only reserved"
16252,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,one or two congenial friends. He selected out of the number of his
16253,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"former domestics one of each sex, steady and confidential, whose lives"
16254,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"he made as comfortable as his own. After all the expenses of his frugal,"
16255,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"but not scanty mode of living were discharged, there remained two thirds"
16256,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"of his income, which he never failed to bestow in secret charity. He"
16257,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"chose that his charities should be secret, not only as being utterly"
16258,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"averse to all ostentation, but also to avoid those importunities which"
16259,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,might lead his bounty to unworthy objects. He would himself know the
16260,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,real circumstances of every case; and it was the chief employment of his
16261,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"time, by hunting into obscure corners, and searching out the private"
16262,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"history of the indigent classes of the community, to obtain exact"
16263,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"information of the existence of misery, and the proper modes of"
16264,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"relieving it. He neglected no kinds of distress, but it was his great"
16265,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"delight to relieve virtuous poverty, and alleviate those keen wounds of"
16266,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,fortune which she inflicts on those who have once participated in some
16267,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,share of her smiles. Hence the sums which he bestowed were often so
16268,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"considerable as at once to retrieve the affairs of the sufferer, nor did"
16269,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,he think it right to withdraw his sustaining hand as long as its support
16270,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,was needful.
16271,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16272,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"With respect to his opinions on other subjects, his enlarged"
16273,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,acquaintance with men and books effectually preserved him from bigotry.
16274,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,"He well knew in what points mankind agreed, and in what they differed,"
16275,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,and he attached much superior importance to the former.
16276,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,
16277,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,So he lived—so he died! injuring none—benefiting many—bearing with pious
16278,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,resignation the evils that fell to his own lot—continually endeavouring
16279,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,to alleviate those of others—and hoping to behold a state in which all
16280,A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.,evil shall be abolished.

16293,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16294,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Papa_—_Lucy_.
16295,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16296,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16297,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Papa._ You may remember, Lucy, that I talked to you sometime ago about"
16298,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the earth’s motion round the sun.
16299,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16300,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lucy._ Yes, papa; and you said you would tell me another time something"
16301,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,about the other planets.
16302,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16303,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ I mean some day to take you to the lecture of an ingenious
16304,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"philosopher, who has contrived a machine that will give you a better"
16305,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"notion of these things in an hour, than I could by mere talking in a"
16306,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,week. But it is now my intention to make you better acquainted with this
16307,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"globe which we inhabit, and which, indeed, is the most important to us."
16308,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,Cast your eyes upon this little ball. You see it is a representation of
16309,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the earth, being covered with a painted map of the world. This map is"
16310,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,crossed with lines in various directions; but all you have to observe
16311,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"relative to what I am going to talk about, is the great line across the"
16312,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"middle called the _equator_ or _equinoctial line_, and the two points at"
16313,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"top and bottom called the _poles_, of which the uppermost is the"
16314,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"northern, the lowermost the southern."
16315,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16316,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I see them.
16317,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16318,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Now, the sun, which illuminates all the parts of this globe by"
16319,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"turns as they roll round before it, shines directly upon the equator,"
16320,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,but darts its rays aslant toward the poles; and this is the cause of the
16321,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"great heat perceived in the middle regions of the earth, and of its"
16322,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,gradual diminution as you proceed from them on either side toward the
16323,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"extremities. To use a familiar illustration, it is like a piece of meat"
16324,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"roasting before a fire, the middle part of which is liable to be"
16325,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"overdone, while the two ends are raw."
16326,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16327,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I can comprehend that.
16328,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16329,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ From this simple circumstance some of the greatest differences on
16330,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the surface of the earth, with respect to man, other animals, and"
16331,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"vegetables, proceed; for heat is the great principle of life and"
16332,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"vegetation; and where it most prevails, provided it be accompanied with"
16333,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"due moisture, nature is most replenished with all sorts of living and"
16334,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"growing things. In general, then, the countries lying on each side about"
16335,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the equator, and forming a broad belt round the globe, called the"
16336,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_tropics_, or _torrid zone_, are rich and exuberant in their products to"
16337,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,a degree much superior to what we see in our climates. Trees and other
16338,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"plants shoot to a vast size, and are clothed in perpetual verdure, and"
16339,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"loaded with flowers of the gayest colours and sweetest fragrance,"
16340,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,succeeded by fruits of high flavour or abundant nutriment. The insect
16341,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"tribe is multiplied so as to fill all the air, and many of them astonish"
16342,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"by their size and extraordinary forms, and the splendour of their hues."
16343,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"The ground is all alive with reptiles, some harmless, some armed with"
16344,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,deadly poisons.
16345,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16346,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ O, but I should not like that at all!"
16347,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16348,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ The birds, however, decked in the gayest plumage conceivable, must"
16349,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"give unmixed delight; and a tropical forest, filled with parrots,"
16350,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"macaws, and peacocks, and enlivened with the gambols of monkeys and"
16351,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"other nimble quadrupeds, must be a very amusing spectacle. The largest"
16352,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"of quadrupeds, too, the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus,"
16353,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,are natives of these regions; and not only these sublime and harmless
16354,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"animals, but the terrible lion, the cruel tiger, and all the most"
16355,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"ravenous beasts of prey, are here found in their greatest bulk and"
16356,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,fierceness.
16357,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16358,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ That would be worse than the insects and reptiles.
16359,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16360,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ The sea likewise is filled with inhabitants of an immense variety
16361,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"of size and figure; not only fishes, but tortoises, and all the shelly"
16362,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,tribes. The shores are spread with shells of a beauty unknown to our
16363,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,coasts; for it would seem as if the influence of the solar heat
16364,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,penetrated into the farthest recesses of nature.
16365,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16366,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ How I should like to ramble on the seaside there!
16367,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16368,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ But the elements, too, are there upon a grand and terrific scale."
16369,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"The sky either blazes with intolerable beams, or pours down rain in"
16370,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"irresistible torrents. The winds swell to furious hurricanes, which"
16371,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,often desolate the whole face of nature in a day. Earthquakes rock the
16372,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"ground, and sometimes open it in chasms which swallow up entire cities."
16373,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Storms raise the waves of the ocean into mountains, and drive them in a"
16374,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,deluge to the land.
16375,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16376,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ Ah! that would spoil my shell-gathering. These countries may be
16377,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"very fine, but I don’t like them."
16378,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16379,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Well, then—we will turn from them to the _temperate_ regions. You"
16380,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"will observe, on looking at the map, that these chiefly lie on the"
16381,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,northern side of the tropics; for on the southern side the space is
16382,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,almost wholly occupied by sea. Though geographers have drawn a boundary
16383,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"line between the torrid and temperate zones, yet nature has made none;"
16384,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"and for a considerable space on the borders, the diminution of heat is"
16385,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,so gradual as to produce little difference in the appearance of nature.
16386,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"But, in general, the temperate _zones_ or _belts_ form the most"
16387,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,desirable districts on the face of the earth. Their products are
16388,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"extremely various, and abound in beauty and utility. Corn, wine, and"
16389,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"oil, are among their vegetable stores: the horse, the ox, and the sheep,"
16390,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,graze their verdant pastures. Their seasons have the pleasing
16391,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"vicissitudes of summer and winter, spring and autumn. Though in some"
16392,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"parts they are subject to excess of heat, and in others of cold, yet"
16393,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,they deserve the general praise of a mild temperature compared to the
16394,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,rest of the globe.
16395,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16396,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ They are the countries for me, then."
16397,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16398,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ You _do_ live in one of them, though our island is situated so far"
16399,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,to the north that it ranks rather among the cold countries than the warm
16400,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"ones. However, we have the good fortune to be a long way removed from"
16401,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,those dreary and comfortless tracts of the globe which lie about the
16402,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"poles, and are called the _frigid zones_. In these, the cheering"
16403,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"influence of the sun gradually becomes extinct, and perpetual frost and"
16404,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,snow take possession of the earth. Trees and plants diminish in number
16405,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"and size, till at length no vegetables are found but some mosses and a"
16406,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,few stunted herbs. Land animals are reduced to three or four
16407,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"species—raindeer, white bears, and arctic foxes. The sea, however, as"
16408,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"far as it remains free from ice, is all alive with aquatic birds, and"
16409,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,with the finny tribe. Enormous whales spout and gambol among the
16410,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"floating ice-islands, and herds of seals pursue the shoals of smaller"
16411,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"fish, and harbour in the caverns of the rocky coasts."
16412,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16413,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ Then I suppose these creatures have not much to do with the sun?
16414,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16415,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Nature has given them powers of enduring cold beyond those of many
16416,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,other animals; and then the water is always warmer than the land in cold
16417,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"climates; nay, at a certain depth, it is equally warm in all parts of"
16418,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the globe.
16419,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16420,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ Well, but as I cannot go to the bottom of the sea, I desire to"
16421,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,have nothing to do with these dismal countries. But do any men live
16422,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,there?
16423,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16424,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ It is one of the wonderful things belonging to man, that he is"
16425,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,capable of living in all parts of the globe where any other animals
16426,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,live. And as nothing relative to this earth is so important to us as the
16427,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"condition of human creatures in it, suppose we take a general survey of"
16428,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the different races of men who inhabit all the tracts we have been
16429,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,speaking of?
16430,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16431,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ Blacks, and whites, and all colours?"
16432,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16433,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Surely. If a black dog is as much a dog as a white one, why should"
16434,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,not a black man be as much a man? I know nothing that colour has to do
16435,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"with mind. Well, then—to go back to the equator. The middle or tropical"
16436,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"girdle of the earth, which by the ancients was concluded to be"
16437,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"uninhabitable from its extreme heat, has been found by modern"
16438,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,discoveries to be as well filled with men as it is with other living
16439,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,creatures. And no wonder; for life is maintained here at less cost than
16440,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,elsewhere. Clothes and fuel are scarcely at all necessary. A shed of
16441,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,bamboo covered with palm-leaves serves for a house; and food is almost
16442,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the spontaneous produce of nature. The bread-fruit, the cocoa, the"
16443,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"banana, and the plantain, offer their stores freely to the gatherer; and"
16444,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"if he takes the additional pains to plant a few yams, or sow a little"
16445,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Indian corn, he is furnished with never-failing plenty. Hence the"
16446,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,inhabitants of many tropical countries live nearly in what is called a
16447,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"state of nature, without care or labour, using the gifts of Providence"
16448,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"like the animals around them. The naked Indian, stretched at ease under"
16449,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the shade of a lofty tree, passes his hours in indolent repose, unless"
16450,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"roused to temporary exertion by the passion of the chase, or the love of"
16451,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,dancing and other social sports.
16452,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16453,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ Well—that would be a charming life!
16454,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16455,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ So the poet Thomson seemed to think, when he burst into a"
16456,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,rapturous description of the beauties and pleasures afforded by these
16457,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,favoured regions. Perhaps you can remember some of his lines?
16458,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16459,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I will try.
16460,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16461,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"——“Thrown at gayer ease, on some fair brow"
16462,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Let me behold, by breezy murmurs cooled,"
16463,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Broad o’er my head the verdant cedar wave,"
16464,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,And high palmettoes lift their grateful shade.
16465,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"O, stretched amid these orchards of the sun,"
16466,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Give me to drain the cocoa’s milky bowl,"
16467,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,And from the palm to draw its freshening wine!”
16468,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16469,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Delightful! Think, however, at what price they purchase this"
16470,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"indolent enjoyment of life. In the first place, all the work that is"
16471,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"done is thrown upon the women, who are always most tyrannized over, the"
16472,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,nearer a people approach to a state of nature.
16473,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16474,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ O, horrible! I am glad I do not live there."
16475,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16476,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Then the mind not having that spur to exertion which necessity
16477,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"alone can give, moulders in inaction, and becomes incapable of those"
16478,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,advances in knowledge and vigour which raise and dignify the human
16479,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,character.
16480,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16481,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ But that is the same with lazy people everywhere.
16482,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16483,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ True. The excessive heat, however, of these countries seems of"
16484,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"itself to relax the mind, and unfit it for its noblest exertions. And I"
16485,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,question if a single instance could be produced of an original
16486,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"inhabitant of the tropics, who had attained to eminence in the higher"
16487,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"walks of science. It is their general character to be gay, volatile, and"
16488,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"thoughtless, subject to violent passions, but commonly mild and gentle,"
16489,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"fond of society and amusements, ingenious in little arts, but incapable"
16490,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,of great or long-continued efforts. They form a large portion of the
16491,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"human race, and probably not the least happy. You see what vast tracts"
16492,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"of land lie within this division; most of Africa and South America, all"
16493,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the great islands of Asia and two of its large peninsulas. Of these the
16494,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Asiatic part is the most populous and civilized; indeed, many of its"
16495,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"nations are as far removed from a state of nature as we are, and their"
16496,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,constitutional indolence has been completely overcome by necessity. The
16497,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"clothing of those who are in a civilized state is mostly made of cotton,"
16498,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,which is a natural product of those climates. Their food is chiefly of
16499,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the vegetable kind and besides the articles already mentioned, consists"
16500,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,much of rice.
16501,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16502,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ Are the people all black?
16503,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16504,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Yes; entirely or nearly so.
16505,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16506,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I suppose that is owing to the heat of the sun.
16507,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16508,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Undoubtedly; for we find all the shades from jet black to tawny,"
16509,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"and at length white, as we proceed from the equator toward the poles."
16510,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"The African negroes, however, from their curled woolly hair and their"
16511,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"flat features, have been supposed an originally distinct race of"
16512,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"mankind. The East Indian blacks, though under an equally hot climate,"
16513,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"have long flowing hair, and features not different from their fairer"
16514,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,neighbours. Almost all these nations are subject to despotic
16515,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"governments. In religion they are mostly pagans, with a mixture of"
16516,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,Mohammedans.
16517,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16518,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I think we have had enough about these people.
16519,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16520,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ Well, then—look again on the globe to the northern side of the"
16521,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"tropics, and see what a tour we shall take among the inhabitants of the"
16522,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,north temperate zone. Here are all the most famous places on the earth;
16523,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"rich, populous countries, renowned at different periods for arts and"
16524,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"arms. Here is the greatest part of Asia, a little of Africa, all Europe,"
16525,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,and North America.
16526,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16527,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ I suppose, however, there must be great differences both in the"
16528,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"climate and the way of life, in so many countries?"
16529,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16530,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Extremely great. The southern parts partake a good deal of the
16531,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"character of the tropical regions. The heat is still excessive, and"
16532,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,renders exertion painful; whence the people have in general been
16533,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"reckoned soft, effeminate, and voluptuous. Let us, however, look at them"
16534,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"a little closer. Here is the mighty empire of China, swarming with"
16535,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"people to such a degree, that, notwithstanding its size and fertility,"
16536,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the inhabitants are obliged to exert the greatest industry to procure
16537,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,the necessaries of life. Nearly in a line with it are the Mogul’s
16538,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Empire, the kingdom of Persia, and the Turkish dominions in Asia; all"
16539,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"warm climates abounding in products of use and beauty, and inhabited by"
16540,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,numerous and civilized people. Here stretches out the great peninsula of
16541,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"Arabia, for the most part a dry and desert land, overspread with burning"
16542,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"sands, only to be crossed by the patient camel. Wild and ferocious"
16543,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"tribes of men wander over it, chiefly supported by their herds and"
16544,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"flocks, and by the trade of robbery, which they exercise on all"
16545,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"travellers that fall in their way. A tract somewhat similar, though in a"
16546,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"colder climate, is the vast country of Tartary, stretching like a belt"
16547,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,from east to west across the middle of Asia; over the immense plains and
16548,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"deserts of which, a number of independent tribes continually roam,"
16549,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"fixing their moveable habitations in one part or another, according as"
16550,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,they afford pasturage to their herds of cattle and horses. These men
16551,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"have for many ages lived in the same simple state, unacquainted as well"
16552,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,with the arts as the vices of civilized nations.
16553,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16554,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ Well. I think it must be a very pleasant life to ramble about from
16555,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"place to place, and change one’s abode according to the season."
16556,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16557,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ The Tartars think so; for the worst wish they can find for man, is"
16558,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,that he may live in a house and work like a Russian. Now look at Europe.
16559,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,See what a small figure it makes on the surface of the globe as to size;
16560,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"and yet it has for many ages held the first place in knowledge,"
16561,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"activity, civilization, and all the qualities that elevate man among his"
16562,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,fellows. For this it is much indebted to that temperature of climate
16563,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,which calls forth all the faculties of man in order to render life
16564,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"comfortable, yet affords enough of the beauties of nature to warm the"
16565,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,heart and exalt the imagination. Men here earn their bread with the
16566,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"sweat of their brow. Nature does not drop her fruits into their mouths,"
16567,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"but offers them as the price of labour. Human wants are many. Clothes,"
16568,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"food, lodging, are all objects of much care and contrivance, but the"
16569,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,human powers fully exerted are equal to the demand; and nowhere are
16570,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,enjoyments so various and multiplied. What the land does not yield
16571,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"itself, its inhabitants by their active industry procure from the"
16572,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"remotest parts of the globe. When we drink tea, we sweeten the infusion"
16573,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,of a Chinese herb with the juice of a West Indian cane; and your common
16574,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,dress is composed of materials collected from the equator to the frigid
16575,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,zone. Europeans render all countries and climates familiar to them; and
16576,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,everywhere they assume a superiority over the less enlightened or less
16577,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,industrious natives.
16578,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16579,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ Then Europe for me, after all! But is not America as good?"
16580,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16581,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Pa._ That part of North America which has been settled by Europeans, is"
16582,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,only another Europe in manners and civilization. But the original
16583,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"inhabitants of that extensive country were bold and hardy barbarians,"
16584,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,and many of them continue so to this day. So much for the temperate
16585,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"zone, which contains the prime of mankind. They differ extremely,"
16586,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"however, in government, laws, customs, and religions. The Christian"
16587,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,religion has the credit of reckoning among its votaries all the
16588,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,civilized people of Europe and America. The Mahometan possesses all the
16589,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"nearer parts of Asia, and the north of Africa, but China, Japan, and"
16590,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"most of the circumjacent countries, profess different forms of paganism."
16591,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"The East, in general, is enslaved to despotism; but the nobler West"
16592,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,enjoys in most of its states more or less of freedom.
16593,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16594,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"As to the frigid zone, its few inhabitants can but just sustain a life"
16595,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,little better than that of the brutes. Their faculties are benumbed by
16596,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"the climate. Their chief employment is the fishery or the chase, by"
16597,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,which they procure their food. The tending of herds of raindeer in some
16598,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,parts varies their occupations and diet. They pass their long winters in
16599,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"holes dug underground, where they doze out most of their time in stupid"
16600,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,repose.
16601,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16602,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Lu._ I wonder any people should stay in such miserable places!
16603,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16604,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Yet none of the inhabitants of the globe seem more attached to
16605,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"their country and way of life. Nor do they, indeed, want powers to"
16606,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"render their situation tolerably comfortable. Their canoes, and fishing,"
16607,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"and hunting tackle, are made with great ingenuity; and their clothing is"
16608,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,admirably adapted to fence against the rigours of cold. They are not
16609,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,without some amusements to cheer the gloom of their condition: but they
16610,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"are abjectly superstitious, and given to fear and melancholy."
16611,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16612,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"_Lu._ If I had my choice, I would rather go to a warmer than a colder"
16613,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,country.
16614,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,
16615,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_Pa._ Perhaps the warmer countries are pleasanter; but there are few
16616,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,advantages which are not balanced by some inconveniences; and it is the
16617,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"truest wisdom to be contented with our lot, and endeavour to make the"
16618,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"best of it. One great lesson, however, I wish you to derive from this"
16619,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,_globe-lecture_. You see that no part of the world is void of our human
16620,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"brethren, who, amid all the diversities of character and condition, are"
16621,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"yet all _men_, filling the station in which their Creator has placed"
16622,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"them. We are too apt to look at the differences of mankind, and to"
16623,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,undervalue all those who do not agree with us in matters that we think
16624,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,of high importance. But who are we—and what cause have we to think
16625,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"ourselves right, and all others wrong? Can we imagine that hundreds of"
16626,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,millions of our species in other parts of the world are left destitute
16627,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"of what is essential to their well-being, while a favoured few like"
16628,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,"ourselves are the only ones who possess it? Having all a common nature,"
16629,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,we must necessarily agree in more things than we differ in. The road to
16630,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,virtue and happiness is alike open to all. The mode of pursuit is
16631,A GLOBE-LECTURE.,various: the end is the same.

16637,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16638,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16639,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"At one of the celebrated schools of painting in Italy, a young man named"
16640,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"Guidotto produced a piece so excellent, that it was the admiration of"
16641,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"the masters in the art, who all declared it to be their opinion that he"
16642,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"could not fail of rising to the summit of his profession, should he"
16643,ENVY AND EMULATION.,proceed as he had begun.
16644,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16645,ENVY AND EMULATION.,This performance was looked upon with very different eyes by two of his
16646,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"fellow-scholars. Brunello, the elder of them, who had himself acquired"
16647,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"some reputation in his studies, was mortified in the highest degree at"
16648,ENVY AND EMULATION.,this superiority of Guidotto; and regarding all the honour his rival had
16649,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"acquired as so much taken from himself, he conceived the most rancorous"
16650,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"dislike of him, and longed for nothing so much as to see him lose the"
16651,ENVY AND EMULATION.,credit he had gained. Afraid openly to decry the merit of a work which
16652,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"had obtained the approbation of the best judges, he threw out secret"
16653,ENVY AND EMULATION.,insinuations that Guidotto had been assisted in it by one or other of
16654,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"his masters; and he affected to represent it as a sort of lucky hit,"
16655,ENVY AND EMULATION.,which the reputed author would never equal.
16656,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16657,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"Not so Lorenzo. Though a very young proficient in the art, he"
16658,ENVY AND EMULATION.,comprehended in its full extent the excellence of Guidotto’s
16659,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"performance, and became one of the sincerest of his admirers. Fired with"
16660,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"the praises he saw him receive on all sides, he ardently longed one day"
16661,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"to deserve the like. He placed him before his eyes as a fair model,"
16662,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"which it was his highest ambition to arrive at equalling—for, as to"
16663,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"excelling him, he could not as yet conceive the possibility of it. He"
16664,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"never spoke of him but with rapture, and could not bear to hear the"
16665,ENVY AND EMULATION.,detractions of Brunello.
16666,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16667,ENVY AND EMULATION.,But Lorenzo did not content himself with words. He entered with his
16668,ENVY AND EMULATION.,whole soul into the career of improvement—was first and last of all the
16669,ENVY AND EMULATION.,scholars in the designing-room—and devoted to practice at home those
16670,ENVY AND EMULATION.,hours which the other youths passed in amusement. It was long before he
16671,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"could please himself with any of the attempts, and he was continually"
16672,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"repeating over them, “Alas! how far distant is this from Guidotto’s!” At"
16673,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"length, however, he had the satisfaction of becoming sensible of"
16674,ENVY AND EMULATION.,progress; and having received considerable applause on account of one of
16675,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"his performances, he ventured to say to himself, “And why may not I too"
16676,ENVY AND EMULATION.,become a Guidotto?”
16677,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16678,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"Meanwhile, Guidotto continued to bear away the palm from all"
16679,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"competitors. Brunello struggled awhile to contest with him, but at"
16680,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"length gave up the point, and consoled himself under his inferiority by"
16681,ENVY AND EMULATION.,ill-natured sarcasm and petulant criticism. Lorenzo worked away in
16682,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"silence, and it was long before his modesty would suffer him to place"
16683,ENVY AND EMULATION.,any piece of his in view at the same time with one of Guidotto’s.
16684,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16685,ENVY AND EMULATION.,There was a certain day in the year in which it was customary for all
16686,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"the scholars to exhibit their best performance in a public hall, where"
16687,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"their merit was solemnly judged by a number of select examiners, and a"
16688,ENVY AND EMULATION.,prize of value was awarded to the most excellent. Guidotto had prepared
16689,ENVY AND EMULATION.,for this anniversary a piece which was to excel all he had before
16690,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"executed. He had just finished it on the evening before the exhibition,"
16691,ENVY AND EMULATION.,and nothing remained but to heighten the colouring by means of a
16692,ENVY AND EMULATION.,transparent varnish. The malignant Brunello contrived artfully to convey
16693,ENVY AND EMULATION.,into the vial containing this varnish some drops of a caustic
16694,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"preparation, the effect of which would be entirely to destroy the beauty"
16695,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"and splendour of the piece. Guidotto laid it on by candlelight, and then"
16696,ENVY AND EMULATION.,with great satisfaction hung up his picture in the public room against
16697,ENVY AND EMULATION.,the morrow.
16698,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16699,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"Lorenzo, too, with beating heart, had prepared himself for the day. With"
16700,ENVY AND EMULATION.,vast application he had finished a piece which he humbly hoped might
16701,ENVY AND EMULATION.,appear not greatly inferior to some of Guidotto’s earlier performances.
16702,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16703,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"The important day was now arrived. The company assembled, and were"
16704,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"introduced into the great room, where the light had just been fully"
16705,ENVY AND EMULATION.,admitted by drawing up a curtain. All went up with raised expectations
16706,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"to Guidotto’s picture, when, behold! instead of the brilliant beauty"
16707,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"they had conceived, there was nothing but a dead surface of confused and"
16708,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"blotched colours. “Surely,” they cried, “this cannot be Guidotto’s!” The"
16709,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"unfortunate youth himself came up, and in beholding the dismal change of"
16710,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"his favourite piece, burst out into an agony of grief, and exclaimed"
16711,ENVY AND EMULATION.,that he was betrayed and undone. The vile Brunello in a corner was
16712,ENVY AND EMULATION.,enjoying his distress. But Lorenzo was little less affected than
16713,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"Guidotto himself. “Trick! knavery!” he cried. “Indeed, gentlemen, this"
16714,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"is not Guidotto’s work: I saw it when only half finished, and it was a"
16715,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"most charming performance. Look at the outline, and judge what it must"
16716,ENVY AND EMULATION.,have been before it was so basely injured.”
16717,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16718,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"The spectators were all struck with Lorenzo’s generous warmth, and"
16719,ENVY AND EMULATION.,sympathized in the disgrace of Guidotto; but it was impossible to
16720,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"adjudge the prize to his picture, in the state in which they beheld it."
16721,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"They examined all the others attentively, and that of Lorenzo, till then"
16722,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"an unknown artist to them, gained a great majority of suffrages. The"
16723,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"prize was therefore awarded to him; but Lorenzo, on receiving it, went"
16724,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"up to Guidotto, and presenting it to him, said, “Take what merit would"
16725,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"undoubtedly have acquired for you, had not the basest malice and envy"
16726,ENVY AND EMULATION.,defrauded you of it. To me it is honour enough to be accounted your
16727,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"second. If hereafter I may aspire to equal you, it shall be by means of"
16728,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"fair competition, not by the aid of treachery.”"
16729,ENVY AND EMULATION.,
16730,ENVY AND EMULATION.,Lorenzo’s nobleness of conduct excited the warmest encomiums among the
16731,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"judges, who at length determined, that for this time there should be two"
16732,ENVY AND EMULATION.,equal prizes distributed; for that if Guidotto had deserved the prize of
16733,ENVY AND EMULATION.,"painting, Lorenzo was entitled to that of virtue."

16747,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","billows beating over her deck, and climbing up her shattered rigging."
16748,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“Mercy! mercy!” exclaimed an ancient solitary, as he viewed from the"
16749,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",cliff the dismal scene. It was in vain. The ship fell on her side and
16750,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",was seen no more.
16751,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16752,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","Soon, however, a small, dark object appeared coming from the rocks"
16753,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","toward the shore; at first, dimly descried through the foam, then quite"
16754,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","plain as it rode on the summit of a wave, then for a time totally lost."
16755,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","It approached, and showed itself to be a boat with men in it rowing for"
16756,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","their lives. The solitary hastened down to the beach, and in all the"
16757,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","agonizing vicissitudes of hope and fear watched its advance. At length,"
16758,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","after the most imminent hazards, the boat was thrown violently on the"
16759,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","shore, and the dripping, half-dead mariners crawled out on dry land."
16760,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16761,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“Heaven be praised!” cried the solitary, “what a providential escape!”"
16762,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","And he led the poor men to his cell, where, kindling a good fire, and"
16763,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","bringing out his little store of provisions, he restored them to health"
16764,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","and spirits. “And are you six men the only ones saved?”—“That we are,”"
16765,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","answered one of them. “Threescore and fifteen men, women, and children,"
16766,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",were in the ship when she struck. You may think what a clamour and
16767,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","confusion there were: women clinging to their husbands’ necks, and"
16768,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","children hanging about their clothes, all shrieking, crying, and"
16769,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",praying! There was no time to be lost. We got out the small-boat in a
16770,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","twinkling—jumped in, without staying for our captain, who was fool"
16771,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","enough to be minding the passengers—cut the rope, and pushed away just"
16772,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","time enough to be clear of the ship as she went down; and here we are,"
16773,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",all alive and merry!” An oath concluded his speech. The solitary was
16774,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","shocked, and could not help secretly wishing that it had pleased"
16775,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","Providence to have saved some of the innocent passengers, rather than"
16776,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",these reprobates.
16777,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16778,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","The sailors having got what they could, departed, scarcely thanking"
16779,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","their benefactor, and marched up the country. Night came on. They"
16780,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","descried a light at some distance, and made up to it. It proceeded from"
16781,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","the window of a good-looking house, surrounded with a farmyard and"
16782,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","garden. They knocked at the door, and in a supplicating tone made known"
16783,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","their distress, and begged relief. They were admitted, and treated with"
16784,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","compassion and hospitality. In the house were the mistress, her"
16785,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","children, and women-servants, an old man and a boy: the master was"
16786,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","abroad. The sailors, sitting round the kitchen fire, whispered to each"
16787,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",other that here was an opportunity of making a booty that would amply
16788,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",compensate for the loss of clothes and wages. They settled their plan;
16789,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","and on the old man’s coming with logs to the fire, one of them broke his"
16790,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","scull with the poker, and laid him dead. Another took up a knife which"
16791,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","had been brought with the loaf and cheese, and running after the boy,"
16792,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","who was making his escape out of the house, stabbed him to the heart."
16793,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","The rest locked the doors, and after tying all the women and children,"
16794,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",began to ransack the house. One of the children continuing to make loud
16795,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","exclamations, a fellow went and strangled it. They had nearly finished"
16796,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","packing up such of the most valuable things as they could carry off,"
16797,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",when the master of the house came home. He was a smuggler as well as a
16798,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","farmer, and had just returned from an expedition, leaving his companions"
16799,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",with their goods at a neighbouring public-house. Surprised at finding
16800,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","the doors locked, and seeing lights moving about in the chambers, he"
16801,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","suspected something amiss; and upon listening, he heard strange voices,"
16802,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",and saw some of the sailors through the windows. He hastened back to his
16803,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","companions, and brought them with him just as the robbers opened the"
16804,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","door, and were coming out with their pillage, having first set fire to"
16805,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","the house, in order to conceal what they had done. The smuggler and his"
16806,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","friends let fly their blunderbusses in the midst of them, and then"
16807,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","rushing forward, seized the survivors, and secured them. Perceiving"
16808,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","flames in the house, they ran and extinguished them. The villains were"
16809,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",next day led to prison amid the curses of the neighbourhood.
16810,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16811,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","The good solitary, on hearing of the event, at first exclaimed, “What a"
16812,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","wonderful interference of Providence, to punish guilt, and protect"
16813,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","innocence!” Pausing awhile, he added, “Yet had Providence thought fit to"
16814,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","have drowned these sailors in their passage from the ship, where they"
16815,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","left so many better people to perish, the lives of three innocent"
16816,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","persons would have been saved, and these wretches would have died"
16817,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","without such accumulated guilt and ignominy. On the other hand, had the"
16818,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","master of the house been at home, instead of following a lawless and"
16819,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","desperate trade, he would perhaps have perished with all his family, and"
16820,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",the villains have escaped with their booty. What am I to think of all
16821,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","this?” Thus pensive and perplexed he laid him down to rest, and after"
16822,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","some time spent in gloomy reflections, fell asleep."
16823,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16824,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","In his dream he fancied himself seated on the top of a high mountain,"
16825,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","where he was accosted by a venerable figure in a long white garment, who"
16826,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",asked him the cause of the melancholy expressed on his countenance. “It
16827,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","is,” said he, “because I am unable to reconcile the decrees of"
16828,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","Providence with my ideas of wisdom and justice.”—“That,” replied the"
16829,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","stranger, “is probably because thy notions of Providence are narrow and"
16830,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","erroneous. Thou seekest it in _particular events_, and dost not raise"
16831,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",thy survey to the _great whole_. Every occurrence in the universe is
16832,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","_providential_, because it is the consequence of those laws which divine"
16833,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",wisdom has established as most productive of the general good. But to
16834,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",select individual facts as more directed by the hand of Providence than
16835,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","others, because we think we see a particular good purpose answered by"
16836,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","them, is an infallible inlet to error and superstition. Follow me to the"
16837,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",edge of the cliff.” He seemed to follow.
16838,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16839,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“Now look down,” said the stranger, “and tell me what thou seest.” “I"
16840,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","see,” replied the solitary, “a hawk darting amid a flock of small birds,"
16841,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","one of which he has caught, while the others escape.”—“And canst thou"
16842,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","think,” rejoined the stranger, “that the single bird made a prey of by"
16843,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","the hawk lies under any particular doom of Providence, or that those who"
16844,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",fly away are more the objects of divine favour than it? Hawks by nature
16845,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","were made to feed upon living prey, and were endowed with strength and"
16846,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",swiftness to enable them to overtake and master it. Thus life is
16847,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",sacrificed to the support of life. But to this destruction limits are
16848,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",set. The small birds are much more numerous and prolific than the birds
16849,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","of prey; and though they cannot resist his force, they have dexterity"
16850,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",and nimbleness of flight sufficient in general to elude his pursuit. It
16851,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",is in this _balance_ that the wisdom of Providence is seen; and what can
16852,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","be a greater proof of it, than that both species, the destroyer and his"
16853,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","prey, have subsisted together from their first creation? Now, look"
16854,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","again, and tell me what thou seest.”"
16855,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16856,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“I see,” said the solitary, “a thick black cloud gathering in the sky. I"
16857,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",hear the thunder rolling from side to side of the vault of heaven. I
16858,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",behold the red lightning darting from the bosom of darkness. Now it has
16859,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","fallen on a stately tree and shattered it to pieces, striking to the"
16860,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",ground an ox sheltered at its foot. Now it falls again in the midst of a
16861,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","flock of timorous sheep, and several of them are left on the plain;—and"
16862,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",see! the shepherd himself lies extended by their side. Now it strikes a
16863,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","lofty spire, and at the same time sets in a blaze an humble cottage"
16864,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",beneath. It is an awful and terrible sight!”
16865,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16866,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“It is so,” returned the stranger, “but what dost thou conclude from it?"
16867,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","Dost thou not know, that from the genial heat which gives life to plants"
16868,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","and animals, and ripens the fruits of the earth, proceeds this"
16869,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","electrical fire, which ascending to the clouds, and charging them beyond"
16870,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","what they are able to contain, is launched again in burning bolts to the"
16871,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",earth? Must it leave its direct course to strike the tree rather than
16872,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","the dome of worship, or to spend its fury on the herd rather than the"
16873,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",herdsman! Millions and millions of living creatures have owed their
16874,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",birth to this active element; and shall we think it strange if a few
16875,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",meet their deaths from it? Thus the mountain torrent that rushes down to
16876,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","fertilize the plain, in its course may sweep away the works of human"
16877,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","industry, and man himself with them; but could its benefits be purchased"
16878,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",at another price?”
16879,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16880,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“All this,” said the solitary, “I tolerably comprehend; but may I"
16881,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",presume to ask whence have proceeded the _moral evils_ of the painful
16882,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",scenes of yesterday? What good end is answered by making man the scourge
16883,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","of man, and preserving the guilty at the cost of the innocent?”"
16884,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16885,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“That, too,” replied the venerable stranger, “is a consequence of the"
16886,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",same wise laws of Providence. If it was right to make man a creature of
16887,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","habit, and render those things easy to him with which he is most"
16888,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","familiar, the sailor, of course, must be better able to shift for"
16889,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","himself in a shipwreck than the passenger; while that self-love, which"
16890,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","is essential to the preservation of life must, in general, cause him to"
16891,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",consult his own safety before that of others. The same force of habit in
16892,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","a way of life full of peril and hardship, must conduce to form a rough,"
16893,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","bold, and unfeeling character. This, under the direction of principle,"
16894,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","will make a brave man; without it, a robber and a murderer. In the"
16895,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","latter case, human laws step in to remove the evil which they have not"
16896,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",been able to prevent. Wickedness meets with the fate which sooner or
16897,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","later always awaits it; and innocence, though it occasionally suffers,"
16898,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",is proved in the end to be the surest path to happiness.”
16899,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16900,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“But,” resumed the solitary, “can it be said that the lot of innocence"
16901,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",is _always_ preferable to that of guilt in this world?”
16902,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",
16903,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","“If it cannot,” replied the other, “thinkest thou that the Almighty is"
16904,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","unable to make retribution in a future world? Dismiss, then, from thy"
16905,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","mind the care of _single events_, secure that the _great whole_ is"
16906,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","ordered for the best. Expect not a particular interposition of Heaven,"
16907,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","because such an interposition would seem to thee seasonable. Thou,"
16908,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","perhaps, wouldest stop the vast machine of the universe to save a fly"
16909,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.",from being crushed under its wheels. But innumerable flies and men are
16910,"PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.","crushed every day, yet the grand motion goes on, and will go on, to"
