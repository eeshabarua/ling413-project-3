64,MAN FRIDAY.,"This is Robinson Crusoe's man, whom he named Friday, because he fell"
65,MAN FRIDAY.,in with him on that day of the week. When Man Friday first saw
66,MAN FRIDAY.,"Robinson Crusoe, he offered to be his servant; he was accepted as"
67,MAN FRIDAY.,"such, and Crusoe found him very useful, for having been born in that"
68,MAN FRIDAY.,"desolate country where Crusoe had been cast away, he was well"
69,MAN FRIDAY.,acquainted with the forms and customs of the neighboring
70,MAN FRIDAY.,"inhabitants, as well as with all the secret caverns and other"
71,MAN FRIDAY.,mysterious places upon the islands.
72,MAN FRIDAY.,
73,MAN FRIDAY.,"He also relieved the solitude of poor Crusoe much; for man, even"
74,MAN FRIDAY.,"though he choose the life of a Hermit, soon finds that the society"
75,MAN FRIDAY.,"of his fellows is necessary to his happiness, and that the words of"
76,MAN FRIDAY.,"the Almighty are as true now as in the beginning--""It is not good"
77,MAN FRIDAY.,"for man to be alone."""

124,THE TWO DOVES.,
125,THE TWO DOVES.,"Fann'd by their soft and tender wings,"
126,THE TWO DOVES.,A moral from their pressure springs;

128,THE TWO DOVES.,As gently as the peaceful dove.
129,THE TWO DOVES.,
130,THE TWO DOVES.,"Oh! ever may such living toys,"

147,MY PRETTY POLLY.,
148,MY PRETTY POLLY.,"And while upon my neck she'll loll,"
149,MY PRETTY POLLY.,"And screaming out, ""Pretty Poll,"""
150,MY PRETTY POLLY.,"I learn from the sweet chattering elf,"
151,MY PRETTY POLLY.,To not have too much tongue myself.
152,MY PRETTY POLLY.,
153,MY PRETTY POLLY.,"I learn how many girls there be,"
154,MY PRETTY POLLY.,"Who without thinking talk like she,"

173,THE NEW FROCK.,
174,THE NEW FROCK.,She looks as if she was dressed to pay a visit to some of her
175,THE NEW FROCK.,"friends; but I hope she will not be proud, and get too fond of going"
176,THE NEW FROCK.,from home; she should remember that her frock was made out of the
177,THE NEW FROCK.,"poor silk-worm's winter house, that her shoes were made out of the"
178,THE NEW FROCK.,"skin of a goat, and the pearls about her neck were drawn from the"
179,THE NEW FROCK.,"bottom of the sea, and that unless she is pleasant, affectionate,"
180,THE NEW FROCK.,"and kind, no body will like her better for her new clothes. There"
181,THE NEW FROCK.,"are some little girls who think because they have a new frock on,"
182,THE NEW FROCK.,"that they are better than others who are dressed in common clothes,"
