36,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
37,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
38,THE FOOLISH COAT.,THE Coat was in a downright rage.
39,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
40,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""To be beaten, and caned, and cuffed, and shaken, two or three times"
41,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"a-day,"" cried he, whisking his tails about like an angry lion, ""I say"
42,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"it's a shame."""
43,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
44,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""If you were not well thrashed,"" said the Cane, ""you'd soon get thick"
45,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"with dust, and _then_ I'd like to know how you'd look."""
46,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
47,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""So _I_ say,"" remarked the Hat."
48,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
49,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""It's all very well for you to talk, Mr. Cane,"" said the Coat, still"
50,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"more in a rage. ""Nobody ever hits you, and if they did, you could hit"
51,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"back. And as for you, Mr. Hat, nobody ever thinks of punching you,"
52,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"except in fun. You have a nice soft brush all to yourself."""
53,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
54,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Well, are you not brushed as well?"" asked the Hat."
55,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
56,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""I don't mind being brushed,"" said the Coat, ""but the next time Mr."
57,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"Valet comes along, and hits me, I'll--I'll--"" then he growled something"
58,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"to himself, whisked his tails, and added, ""_See_ if I don't."""
59,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
60,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"In came the Valet, and bustled about. The Coat eyed him, and when he"
61,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"came close, caught him up with _such_ a clutch."
62,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
63,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Hallo, hallo, hallo!"" cried the Valet. ""What are you doing?"""
64,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
65,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"But the Coat hung the Valet on a nail, and snatched up the Cane."
66,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
67,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Now, look here, Mister Valet,"" said he. ""I'm not going to be dusted and"
68,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"beaten and thumped. I'm just going to show you what it feels like,"
69,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"Mister Valet."""
70,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
71,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""What are you talking about, you stupid old Coat?"" said the Valet."
72,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
73,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""I'll let you see,"" said the Coat, flourishing the Cane."
74,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
75,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"The Cane could not help himself, for he was thin."
76,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
77,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"Thump, thump, thump, went the Coat, blowing out such clouds and clouds"
78,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"of dust from the Valet's clothes, never remembering he was covering"
79,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"himself with dust, and making himself look shockingly shabby. The Valet"
80,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"called out as loud as he could for help, but nobody heard him, and the"
81,THE FOOLISH COAT.,Coat kept on thumping till his sleeves fairly ached. Then he dropped the
82,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"Cane, fell on the dirty floor, and whisked his tails with great"
83,THE FOOLISH COAT.,satisfaction.
84,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
85,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"The Cane jumped up, and lifted down the Valet, who went off to his own"
86,THE FOOLISH COAT.,room.
87,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
88,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"A few days after, the master came in, and looked at the Coat, which he"
89,THE FOOLISH COAT.,had meant to wear at a jolly garden party.
90,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
91,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Oh,"" said he, ""how dreadfully shabby that Coat looks."""
92,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
93,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Yes, sir,"" said the Valet, ""he won't allow himself to be brushed or"
94,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"dusted."""
95,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
96,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Oh, won't he?"" said the Master, ""that's all very fine, but it won't do"
97,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"for me."" So he seized the Cane, and gave the Coat one good thump. But"
98,THE FOOLISH COAT.,such a cloud of dust came out of the Coat that the Master threw down the
99,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"Cane, and ran to the door."
100,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
101,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"""Oh,"" cried he, ""I can't wear that frightful old thing any more. It is"
102,THE FOOLISH COAT.,disgracefully shabby and dusty. Sell it to the first 'ole clo'' man that
103,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"comes along."" But he took the Hat, and went to the nice party."
104,THE FOOLISH COAT.,
105,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"And what do you think became of this foolish Coat? Why, he was hung on a"
106,THE FOOLISH COAT.,"stick in a field to make a scare-crow. And serve him right, a stupid"
107,THE FOOLISH COAT.,thing.
108,THE FOOLISH COAT.,

112,ALF AND THE PARROT.,ALF AND THE PARROT.
113,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
114,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
115,ALF AND THE PARROT.,The old Poll Parrot was in a rage;
116,ALF AND THE PARROT.,He bounced and spluttered about in his cage.
117,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
118,ALF AND THE PARROT.,The reason he felt so much displeased
119,ALF AND THE PARROT.,Was because young Alf had worried and teased.
120,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
121,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"He pecked, and bobbed, and knocked with his beak,"
122,ALF AND THE PARROT.,Too much enraged to be able to speak.
123,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
124,ALF AND THE PARROT.,To tease him was a scandalous shame:
125,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Alf was a bad boy, and much to blame."
126,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
127,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""I tell you, young Alf,"" at last Poll said,"
128,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""If you don't leave off, I'll snap off your head."
129,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
130,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""You think you're allowed to tease a bird."
131,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Now, that idea's extremely absurd."
132,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
133,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""One thing, young Alf, is certain and sure--"
134,ALF AND THE PARROT.,Your worry and bother no more I'll endure.
135,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
136,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""Another thing, Alf, is also clear:"
137,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"I mean to walk out, and lock you in here."""
138,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
139,ALF AND THE PARROT.,Poor Alfy screamed and bawled with rage
140,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"When Poll marched out, and put _him_ in the cage!"
141,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
142,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Cried Alf, ""I think this horrible bird"
143,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Is going to be as good as his word."""
144,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
145,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Laughed old Poll, as he perched on a chair,"
146,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""You thought to punish you I'd never dare."
147,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
148,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"""You may bawl or howl, or scream and rage--"
149,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"I'm going to lock the door of the cage!"""
150,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
151,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Alfy did cry out--Oh! didn't he shout,"
152,ALF AND THE PARROT.,When he found the Parrot would not let him out!
153,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
154,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"Said Poll, ""My dear boy, it's now _our_ turn;"
155,ALF AND THE PARROT.,"The world's upside down, as you have to learn."""
156,ALF AND THE PARROT.,
157,ALF AND THE PARROT.,So Alf was forced to make up his mind
158,ALF AND THE PARROT.,In the cage of the Parrot to be confined.

165,THE CLEVER HARE.,THE CLEVER HARE.
166,THE CLEVER HARE.,
167,THE CLEVER HARE.,
168,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""TO be hunted, and trapped, and watched for by night, and--and--I don't"
169,THE CLEVER HARE.,"know what, is most abominable!"" said the Hare."
170,THE CLEVER HARE.,
171,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Some dogs had frightened him, and he had run--run like a hare, in fact,"
172,THE CLEVER HARE.,and then sat down upon his form to think. The dogs had not stood upon
173,THE CLEVER HARE.,"ceremony, so he didn't choose to stand upon forms, but sat down"
174,THE CLEVER HARE.,comfortably.
175,THE CLEVER HARE.,
176,THE CLEVER HARE.,"He twitched his ears, and scratched his wig, and thought."
177,THE CLEVER HARE.,
178,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""And I won't put up with it--_there_,"" said he, aloud. ""It's only"
179,THE CLEVER HARE.,"cowardice putting up with things. I'll get some fellows to help me, and"
180,THE CLEVER HARE.,"we'll hunt the dogs."""
181,THE CLEVER HARE.,
182,THE CLEVER HARE.,At that moment he heard a sound.
183,THE CLEVER HARE.,
184,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""Wow! bow, wow, wow!"" barked some dog, a little way off."
185,THE CLEVER HARE.,
186,THE CLEVER HARE.,"The Hare jumped up again, and flew off as quick as his legs would carry"
187,THE CLEVER HARE.,"him. After running some distance, he sat down again, but this time he"
188,THE CLEVER HARE.,found neither forms nor ceremonies.
189,THE CLEVER HARE.,
190,THE CLEVER HARE.,But he found something that was better. A gun and a sportsman's bag were
191,THE CLEVER HARE.,"lying near, and he eyed them."
192,THE CLEVER HARE.,
193,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""I wonder if that gun would go off if I touched it!"" he said to himself."
194,THE CLEVER HARE.,
195,THE CLEVER HARE.,"He walked round and round it, and then cautiously pawed it. No: it"
196,THE CLEVER HARE.,didn't seem to have the least idea of going off.
197,THE CLEVER HARE.,
198,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Then he lifted it up, and grew quite bold."
199,THE CLEVER HARE.,
200,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""I wonder if I could shoot anything?"" thought he."
201,THE CLEVER HARE.,
202,THE CLEVER HARE.,"He aimed at a bird, and brought it down."
203,THE CLEVER HARE.,
204,THE CLEVER HARE.,[Illustration]
205,THE CLEVER HARE.,
206,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""Bravo, bravo, bravo!"" cried he. ""I'll take this gun, and then if"
207,THE CLEVER HARE.,"anybody tries to torment or to catch me, I'll--I'll kill them."""
208,THE CLEVER HARE.,
209,THE CLEVER HARE.,"He hung the bag round his waist, and put the gun on his shoulder, then"
210,THE CLEVER HARE.,"walked off to his home. On the way, a boy ran at him, and cried ""Bo!"""
211,THE CLEVER HARE.,"but he just pointed the gun, and the boy ran away."
212,THE CLEVER HARE.,
213,THE CLEVER HARE.,"The Hare lived all by himself, but he was very comfortable. Nobody could"
214,THE CLEVER HARE.,"bother him, and he would have been quite content only for the men and"
215,THE CLEVER HARE.,the dogs.
216,THE CLEVER HARE.,
217,THE CLEVER HARE.,Every day he practised with his gun till he got to be very skilful.
218,THE CLEVER HARE.,
219,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""Just let them come along"
220,THE CLEVER HARE.,"And they shall all soon see,"
221,THE CLEVER HARE.,That they're all in the wrong
222,THE CLEVER HARE.,To plague and bother me.
223,THE CLEVER HARE.,
224,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Although I'm but a hare,"
225,THE CLEVER HARE.,"I think I'm very smart,"
226,THE CLEVER HARE.,And can--let them beware--
227,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Right well take my own part."""
228,THE CLEVER HARE.,
229,THE CLEVER HARE.,"So he sang, as he sat one day polishing up his gun."
230,THE CLEVER HARE.,
231,THE CLEVER HARE.,"As he was busily at work, he heard a noise, and cocked his ear. Tramp,"
232,THE CLEVER HARE.,"tramp, tramp, came along some one--a man. It was a poacher, who said to"
233,THE CLEVER HARE.,himself he was going to catch a fine fat Hare. The man cast an eye
234,THE CLEVER HARE.,"round, but the Hare hid, and watched."
235,THE CLEVER HARE.,
236,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Then the man stole nearer, and peeped round a tree."
237,THE CLEVER HARE.,
238,THE CLEVER HARE.,"""Aha!"" said the Hare. ""You want to catch me, and eat me, don't you? But"
239,THE CLEVER HARE.,"I am going to catch you, and boil you for my supper."""
240,THE CLEVER HARE.,
241,THE CLEVER HARE.,"The man only laughed, for it was preposterous the idea of a Hare"
242,THE CLEVER HARE.,"catching a man, instead of a man catching a hare."
243,THE CLEVER HARE.,
244,THE CLEVER HARE.,"And the Hare just cocked his gun, put it to his shoulder, and fired."
245,THE CLEVER HARE.,"Then he did kill the poacher, and took him home, and stewed him with"
246,THE CLEVER HARE.,mushrooms for supper.

255,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
256,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""WHERE'S the good of going on grumble, grumble, grumble, all the day"
257,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"long?"" said the strong Man to the Invalid. ""Why, you get petted and have"
258,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"extra nice things to eat, beautiful bunches of grapes, and boiled"
259,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"chickens, and I don't know what."""
260,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
261,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""If you were _me_, you would not talk like that,"" said the Invalid, in a"
262,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"poor sick weak voice. ""I'd eat dry bread, and never ask to be petted at"
263,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"all if I were strong, like you."""
264,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
265,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"The Strong Man laughed, as if he didn't believe the Invalid."
266,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
267,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""I have to work hard all day, and nobody seems to care a bit whether I'm"
268,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"tired or not,"" said he. ""But if you only have a finger ache, everybody"
269,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,is running about trying to find something to do you good. And they come
270,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"and read to you, and bring you flowers, and--and--"""
271,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
272,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""You just take my place for a day or two, and see how you'd like it,"""
273,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,said the Invalid.
274,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
275,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""Um--well, I shouldn't like to be ill, you know,"" said the Strong Man."
276,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""I shouldn't like to lie in bed, nor have the doctor coming to see me,"
277,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"because he'd give me nasty stuff to take."""
278,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
279,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""I'll be your doctor,"" said the Invalid. ""But you must lie in bed. Come,"
280,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"take my place."""
281,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
282,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,The Strong Man was ashamed to refuse.
283,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
284,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""Well, now you are comfortable, I suppose,"" said the Invalid, tucking"
285,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"him in. ""You must try to doze a little."""
286,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
287,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"[Illustration: Lith. Emrik & Binger, Haarlem.]"
288,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
289,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""But I'm not sleepy,"" said the Strong Man."
290,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
291,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""You'll soon be tired, and go to sleep,"" said the Invalid. ""I'm going"
292,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"away, but shall be back in an hour or two."""
293,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
294,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"When he went away, the place seemed dreadfully dull. Not a sound was to"
295,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"be heard except the barking of a dog in a farm-yard near, and the cluck"
296,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,cluck of some hens.
297,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
298,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""Dear, dear,"" said the Strong Man, ""this is very tiresome."""
299,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
300,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,Presently an old lady looked in.
301,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
302,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""Poor dear, poor dear,"" said she, ""I will read a nice book to you."""
303,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
304,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,So she sat down and read out of a book. But the Strong Man didn't care
305,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"about the book, and he thought the old lady stupid."
306,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
307,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"Then she went away, and by-and-by, a kind old gentleman came in with"
308,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"some chicken, and a glass of wine, and some beautiful white bread."
309,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
310,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""Here,"" said he, ""Take this, it will do you good."""
311,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
312,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"But the Strong Man didn't feel hungry, and he was tired and cross by"
313,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"this time, so he wouldn't have any of it. Then some more people came in,"
314,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"and talked to him, and told him the Invalid had gone to see the reapers,"
315,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,and tried to be kind to him. Then at last everybody stole away on
316,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"tiptoe, and left him alone."
317,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
318,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,Then the Invalid came back. But by that time the Strong Man had had
319,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"quite enough of being shut up in a sick room, so he jumped up, and ran"
320,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,to the door.
321,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,
322,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,"""I see you are not much to be envied,"" said he to the Invalid. ""I don't"
323,THE STRONG MAN AND THE INVALID,think I shall ever envy anybody again so long as I have health and

331,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
332,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,THE Kite laughed and chuckled to himself until his paper fairly
333,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,crackled.
334,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
335,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""We shall have such a game,"" said he to his paper Tails."
336,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
337,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""We mostly do,"" squeaked the Tails."
338,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
339,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"There were eighteen of them, and they were all very frisky."
340,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
341,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"The Kite first winked one eye, then the other, then winked both"
342,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,together.
343,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
344,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"I'm afraid he was rather a vulgar sort of a Kite, but he was very jolly."
345,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"His eyes were inclined to be goggly, yellow round the outside, with red"
346,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"in the middle. He was not a particularly good-looking Kite--in fact, he"
347,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"was really ugly--but he was very funny, and loved a joke."
348,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
349,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"The string suddenly wakened up out of a nap, hearing talk going on, ""Eh,"
350,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"what's that?"" said he."
351,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
352,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Don't know,"" said the Tails."
353,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
354,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"The Kite laughed again, and shook his round ears, and showed all his"
355,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"teeth in one wide grin. ""We'll have a game this afternoon,"" said he,"
356,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,once more.
357,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
358,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Oh,"" said the String. ""We mostly do."""
359,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
360,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"The Kite stuck up his pointed chin, and shook his red paper beard. ""I"
361,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"mean a different sort of game to what _you_ mean,"" said he. ""You mean,"
362,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"we have a game when young Walter takes us out. But I don't mean _that_."""
363,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
364,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Then what _do_ you mean?"" said the String, who didn't care about"
365,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,guessing.
366,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
367,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""When he takes us out, we have to go where _he_ likes, and fly when he"
368,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"chooses us to fly,"" said the Kite. ""Now _I_ mean, we'll fly young"
369,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"Walter."""
370,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
371,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Eh?"" said the String."
372,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
373,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,[Illustration]
374,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
375,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"The String was rather sleepy-headed, and didn't take in new ideas very"
376,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,quickly. He was so astonished now that he unrolled himself several

378,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,be out of his mind.
379,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
380,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Eh?"" said all the Tails, after a flutter of surprise. But they thought"
381,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"it was a joke, and that the Kite only meant to be funny. The Kite"
382,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"straightened himself, and looked very important. ""When I say a thing, I"
383,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"mean it,"" said he, in a dignified manner."
384,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
385,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Well, but--"" said one Tail, timidly."
386,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
387,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""_Well_, but what?"" snapped the Kite. ""You don't know what you're"
388,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"talking about. I say we'll fly--"""
389,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
390,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"At that minute up came Walter. He took hold of the Kite, and was winding"
391,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"up the String, when the Kite said--"
392,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
393,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Master Walter, let's fly _you_ to day!"""
394,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
395,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,Walter stared and laughed.
396,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
397,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""You couldn't,"" said he. ""You're only made of paper."""
398,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
399,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""Let us try,"" said the Kite."
400,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
401,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"""I mustn't go far, then,"" said Walter, ""because my mother would wonder"
402,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"where I was."""
403,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,
404,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"So the String was tied about Walter, and up he flew. It was very jolly,"
405,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,and he flew here and there like a bird. The Kite and the String were
406,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"delighted, and the Tails kept on a chatter, chatter, chatter, like"
407,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,eighteen little magpies all in a row. But the Kite found it hard work
408,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"after a time. He had to mind the string, and watch lest Walter should"
409,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"tumble down, and keep on doing this and doing that, instead of"
410,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"pleasantly fluttering about. He got cross and grumpy at last. ""I think"
411,THE KITE'S LITTLE GAME,"the old way's the best,"" said he. ""Next time I'll go up. Old ways are"

426,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,
427,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,While the birds and the poultry
428,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,Are swimming about
429,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,Like so many mackerel

432,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,"In old times, the fishes,"

436,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,

438,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,"They have changed the old times,"
439,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,"Turned the world topsy-turvy,"
440,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,With no reasons or rhymes.
441,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,
442,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,But I think you'll agree
443,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,It is simply absurd
444,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,For a fish to pretend
445,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,He is just like a bird.
446,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,
447,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,But for birds to be fishes
448,THE BIRDS AND THE FISHES.,Is really as bad:

466,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
467,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"ONE fine summer's afternoon, the Lion went trotting home in high good"
468,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"humour. As he went along, he kept muttering and grinning to himself, as"
469,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"if mightily pleased. When he got home, he banged at the door of his den"
470,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"with his tail. A Lion's tail is very strong and hard, you know, stronger"
471,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"and harder than any bell rope. The Lioness, his wife, was out at the"
472,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"back, combing out the manes of her young Lions, but presently she came"
473,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,and opened the door.
474,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
475,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""My dear,"" cried the Lion, ""_such_ a piece of news!"""
476,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
477,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Oh, indeed?"" said the Lioness. ""Have you found some travellers to eat?"""
478,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
479,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Better than _that_,"" said the Lion, all a-glow, rubbing his paws."
480,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
481,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Oh, in-_deed_,"" said the Lioness, smiling. ""Then it must be very good"
482,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"indeed."""
483,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
484,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Yes,"" said the Lion. ""Just guess, my love."""
485,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
486,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""How _can_ I guess? I never was good at guessing. Besides, you could"
487,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"tell me quicker than I could guess,"" said the Lion's wife."
488,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
489,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""How clever you are,"" said the Lion, putting his tawny head on one side,"
490,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"and looking admiringly at his queen. ""Perhaps telling _is_ the quickest"
491,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"way after all. Well--"" Then he stopped, as if to tantalize."
492,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
493,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Well--what? How tiresome you are,"" said the Lioness."
494,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
495,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""They have brought a cageful of humans to the town, and all the Beasts"
496,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"and all the Birds are going to see the show."""
497,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
498,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""_What!_"" cried the Lioness, so astonished that she could hardly believe"
499,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,her ears.
500,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
501,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"The Lion skipped right round the parlour three times, snapping his"
502,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"claws like castanets. ""Yes,"" said he, gleefully, ""they used to lock _us_"
503,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"up, and let people pay to see us, and call us Wild Beasts, and"
504,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"Carnivora, and all sorts of ugly names. But times are changed. I wonder"
505,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,how they'll like it? We'll take our little beasts of children to see the
506,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"show."""
507,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
508,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""You _shouldn't_ call the little ducks Beasts,"" said the Lioness. ""I"

510,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
511,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Well, they _are_ Beasts and Cubs, ain't they?"" said the Lion."
512,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
513,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Well, never mind, I won't have them spoken of like that,"" said his"

515,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"show?"""
516,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
517,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Come now,"" said the Lion, jingling his money in the purse he carried in"

526,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
527,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"The young cubs came rolling in, all tumbling over one another, like"
528,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"jolly little brutes as they were, and set up a wild roar of delight at"
529,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"hearing they were going out for the day. When they got half way, the"
530,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,Lion suddenly stopped and considered.
531,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
532,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""I think,"" said he, ""as we are going to change places with the humans,"

537,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,

539,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
540,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"So they went into a shop, which they found belonged to a very civil"
541,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"elephant. They were quickly fitted out with nice suits, and then trotted"
542,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,contentedly on. A large crowd of beasts and birds was going the same
543,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"way, and at the door it was hard to get in. The greatest excitement"
544,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"prevailed--which means, you know, that people--animals, I mean--were"
545,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"laughing and talking, and wondering, and squeezing, and pushing, and"
546,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"treading on one another's toes, and saying ""Where are you shoving to?"""
547,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"and ""There's plenty of room,"" and ""Don't be disagreeable,"" and ""Don't"
548,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"lose your temper, pray,"" and asking questions, and all that kind of"
549,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"thing. The Lion and his wife were afraid to take in the children, so"
550,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"left them outside with an old Cow, who was herself too frightened to"
551,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"venture, and too fat to squeeze through the throng. Inside, the animals"
552,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,were all staring their hardest. The humans in the cages didn't at all
553,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"relish being shown, and were very cross. A Wolf with a long stick was"
554,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"telling about all their ways, and poking them up to make them roar. One"
555,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"young man in a blue coat howled with rage, until a good-natured old"
556,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"Rhinoceros, with a red shawl, threw him a bun. He was so ungrateful as"
557,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"to kick it out of his cage, which offended the old Rhinoceros, as you"
558,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,may imagine.
559,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
560,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Times are changed, ain't they?"" said a jolly old Bear to the Lion,"
561,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,chuckling.
562,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
563,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"""Quite time too,"" answered the Lion."
564,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,
565,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"The Ostrich craned his long neck, and stared as hard as he could, as did"
566,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"all the animals. The Lioness was very well pleased, but she hurried out"
567,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"to see after her children, while the Lion stayed to have a good look. In"
568,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,"fact, there never had been such a sight seen in Beastland before, and I"
569,THE WONDERFUL SHOW.,don't suppose there ever will be such a one again.

582,THE UNKIND TREES.,
583,THE UNKIND TREES.,"""That's what _I_ say,"" grumbled the Elm."

585,THE UNKIND TREES.,"""To be sure,"" cried the Oak, in a deep, deep, deep voice--you would have"

594,THE UNKIND TREES.,
595,THE UNKIND TREES.,"""Yes,"" said the Poplar, a tall, straight, stiff tree, with a squeaky"

600,THE UNKIND TREES.,
601,THE UNKIND TREES.,"""Everybody encourages them to do it,"" said the Box Tree, angrily. The"

609,THE UNKIND TREES.,The trees all fluttered their leaves. They were rather frightened at the

614,THE UNKIND TREES.,
615,THE UNKIND TREES.,"The Ivy had not said a word, but listened to everything. Now she lifted"

627,THE UNKIND TREES.,"want of fire, it is selfish to grumble about a few fagots of wood."""
628,THE UNKIND TREES.,
629,THE UNKIND TREES.,"There was a deep stillness. Not a word did any tree speak, till the Elm"

632,THE UNKIND TREES.,

639,THE UNKIND TREES.,"He looked about, and noticed some branches that might be cut off without"
