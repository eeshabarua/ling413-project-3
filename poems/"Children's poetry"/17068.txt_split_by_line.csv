56,G. H. THOMPSON,The Animals' Rebellion.
57,G. H. THOMPSON,
58,G. H. THOMPSON,
59,G. H. THOMPSON,"The ""Trip to Sea""[A] had long been made,"
60,G. H. THOMPSON,"The ""Picnic""[B] bills had all been paid;"
61,G. H. THOMPSON,"But if you'll listen, I will tell"
62,G. H. THOMPSON,What made the animals rebel.
63,G. H. THOMPSON,
64,G. H. THOMPSON,The Tiger was dissatisfied--
65,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Why should the Lion reign?"" he cried;"
66,G. H. THOMPSON,"""He's no more King of Beasts than I;"
67,G. H. THOMPSON,"So let us all his rule defy!"""
68,G. H. THOMPSON,
69,G. H. THOMPSON,A secret meeting then he called:
70,G. H. THOMPSON,"And while the others stood appalled,"
71,G. H. THOMPSON,"His wants and grievances explained,"
72,G. H. THOMPSON,And quickly some adherents gained.
73,G. H. THOMPSON,
74,G. H. THOMPSON,The Fox his joy could not conceal--
75,G. H. THOMPSON,"""In guns,"" thought he, ""I'll make a deal!"""
76,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Owl, who all his speeches heard,"
77,G. H. THOMPSON,Took care to take down every word:
78,G. H. THOMPSON,
79,G. H. THOMPSON,"And ere the rising of the sun,"
80,G. H. THOMPSON,The Great Rebellion had begun!

91,G. H. THOMPSON,The Tiger's Petition
92,G. H. THOMPSON,
93,G. H. THOMPSON,
94,G. H. THOMPSON,"The King sat on his Throne one day,"
95,G. H. THOMPSON,His Crown upon his brow;
96,G. H. THOMPSON,"To him, in most obsequious way,"
97,G. H. THOMPSON,The Tiger made his bow.
98,G. H. THOMPSON,
99,G. H. THOMPSON,"His long petition he unrolled,"
100,G. H. THOMPSON,With names all written down;
101,G. H. THOMPSON,The courtiers stared--their blood ran cold--
102,G. H. THOMPSON,King Leo gave a frown.
103,G. H. THOMPSON,
104,G. H. THOMPSON,"""What have we here?"" demanded he,"
105,G. H. THOMPSON,"""And what does he require?"""
106,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Elephant said, ""Here I see"
107,G. H. THOMPSON,"A traitor, royal sire!"""
108,G. H. THOMPSON,
109,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Brown Bear murmured, ""So do I--"
110,G. H. THOMPSON,"He's right, without a doubt!"""
111,G. H. THOMPSON,"The monarch cried, with flashing eye,"
112,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Turn this intruder out!"""
113,G. H. THOMPSON,
114,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: PRESENTING A PETITION TO THE KING]
115,G. H. THOMPSON,
116,G. H. THOMPSON,"At midnight, in an empty hut,"
117,G. H. THOMPSON,"Deep in the forest old,"
118,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Rebels met with doors close shut,"
119,G. H. THOMPSON,Their dark schemes to unfold.
120,G. H. THOMPSON,
121,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Friends!"" Tiger cried, ""no more we'll brook"
122,G. H. THOMPSON,This despot's cruel reign;
123,G. H. THOMPSON,Our charter lies before us--look!
124,G. H. THOMPSON,"The plan of our campaign!"""
125,G. H. THOMPSON,
126,G. H. THOMPSON,

129,G. H. THOMPSON,Mr. Fox's Armoury.
130,G. H. THOMPSON,
131,G. H. THOMPSON,
132,G. H. THOMPSON,"Directly Brother Fox was told,"
133,G. H. THOMPSON,"He ransacked all his stores,"
134,G. H. THOMPSON,And soon was making bags of gold
135,G. H. THOMPSON,And selling guns in scores.
136,G. H. THOMPSON,
137,G. H. THOMPSON,The Brown Bear bought a blunderbuss;
138,G. H. THOMPSON,"And when they saw the arm,"
139,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Bunnies all cried, ""Don't shoot _us_!"
140,G. H. THOMPSON,"We've not done any harm!"""
141,G. H. THOMPSON,
142,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Tiger thought revolvers best,"
143,G. H. THOMPSON,So he bought half a score;
144,G. H. THOMPSON,"""No guns I've had,"" said Fox, with zest,"
145,G. H. THOMPSON,"""_Went off_ so well before!"""
146,G. H. THOMPSON,
147,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Don't fear, my Bunnies, you'll be shot,"
148,G. H. THOMPSON,Though each has bought a gun;
149,G. H. THOMPSON,"I'll whisper this,"" said  Fox: ""they've got"
150,G. H. THOMPSON,"Blank cartridge ev'ry one!"""

156,G. H. THOMPSON,
157,G. H. THOMPSON,Raising the Standard.
158,G. H. THOMPSON,
159,G. H. THOMPSON,
160,G. H. THOMPSON,"From lair to lair the news soon spread,"
161,G. H. THOMPSON,"And one and all leapt out of bed,"
162,G. H. THOMPSON,"And sallied forth, with loud hurrays,"
163,G. H. THOMPSON,The Standard of Revolt to raise.
164,G. H. THOMPSON,
165,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Bear looked fierce, the Crocodile"
166,G. H. THOMPSON,Put on his most bloodthirsty smile;
167,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Leopard and the Wolf were there,"
168,G. H. THOMPSON,And cheers resounded in the air.
169,G. H. THOMPSON,
170,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Tiger roared a lengthy speech,"
171,G. H. THOMPSON,"And called, in loudest tones, on each"
172,G. H. THOMPSON,"To do his best when came the fray,"
173,G. H. THOMPSON,"Not be afraid, nor run away."
174,G. H. THOMPSON,
175,G. H. THOMPSON,"Cried he: ""Now, onward to the field,"
176,G. H. THOMPSON,"To make this tyrant monarch yield!"""
177,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Charge, Leopard, charge--on, Tiger, on!"""
178,G. H. THOMPSON,Were the first words of Rebellion.
179,G. H. THOMPSON,
180,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: RAISING THE STANDARD OF REVOLT]
181,G. H. THOMPSON,
182,G. H. THOMPSON,"Next morn a Scout the Camp alarms,"
183,G. H. THOMPSON,The Lion's soldiers fly to arms.
184,G. H. THOMPSON,"""The enemy advance!"" he cries,"
185,G. H. THOMPSON,"""And means to take you by surprise!"""
186,G. H. THOMPSON,"In Leo's Camp, on Zootown plains,"
187,G. H. THOMPSON,The utmost consternation reigns.
188,G. H. THOMPSON,
189,G. H. THOMPSON,
190,G. H. THOMPSON,
191,G. H. THOMPSON,
192,G. H. THOMPSON,In Leo's Camp.
193,G. H. THOMPSON,
194,G. H. THOMPSON,
195,G. H. THOMPSON,This startling news the peaceful Camp
196,G. H. THOMPSON,"With preparation fills,"
197,G. H. THOMPSON,"Resounding with the soldiers' tramp,"
198,G. H. THOMPSON,The noise of many drills.
199,G. H. THOMPSON,
200,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Sergeants shout, the General storms;"
201,G. H. THOMPSON,All round one sees and hears
202,G. H. THOMPSON,"The trying on of uniforms,"
203,G. H. THOMPSON,The clank of swords and spears.
204,G. H. THOMPSON,
205,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Fox pretended, by and by,"
206,G. H. THOMPSON,"To be deaf, dumb and lame;"
207,G. H. THOMPSON,"But Jacko, with a placard ""Spy,"""
208,G. H. THOMPSON,Quite spoilt his little game.
209,G. H. THOMPSON,
210,G. H. THOMPSON,"Field Marshal Hippo shouted out,"
211,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Arrest him on the spot!"""
212,G. H. THOMPSON,"If he had not escaped, no doubt"
213,G. H. THOMPSON,He'd promptly have been shot.
214,G. H. THOMPSON,

217,G. H. THOMPSON,
218,G. H. THOMPSON,
219,G. H. THOMPSON,
220,G. H. THOMPSON,Preparing for the Fray.
221,G. H. THOMPSON,
222,G. H. THOMPSON,"Preparing for the coming fray,"
223,G. H. THOMPSON,The Camp was busy night and day;
224,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Rhino had his horn re-ground,"
225,G. H. THOMPSON,Because it had got blunt he found.
226,G. H. THOMPSON,
227,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Elephant had his tusks, too,"
228,G. H. THOMPSON,Re-sharpened till they looked like new;
229,G. H. THOMPSON,"In fact, the Ape's new grindstone strong"
230,G. H. THOMPSON,Was working nearly all day long.
231,G. H. THOMPSON,
232,G. H. THOMPSON,All day the Camp was never still--
233,G. H. THOMPSON,"With marching to and fro, and drill;"
234,G. H. THOMPSON,"And quite right too, since it appears"
235,G. H. THOMPSON,They hadn't been to war for years.
236,G. H. THOMPSON,
237,G. H. THOMPSON,The oldest there had never known
238,G. H. THOMPSON,Such preparations to be shown;
239,G. H. THOMPSON,"Indeed, they'd never had, somehow,"
240,G. H. THOMPSON,A great Rebellion until now.
241,G. H. THOMPSON,
242,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: PREPARING FOR THE FRAY]
243,G. H. THOMPSON,
244,G. H. THOMPSON,"Next day took place the Grand Review,"
245,G. H. THOMPSON,"Before His Majesty,"
246,G. H. THOMPSON,The troops marched past in order true--
247,G. H. THOMPSON,A splendid sight to see.
248,G. H. THOMPSON,
249,G. H. THOMPSON,"The speech he made filled all with pride,"
250,G. H. THOMPSON,As brave as brave could be:
251,G. H. THOMPSON,"""For Country and for King,"" he cried,"
252,G. H. THOMPSON,"""On, on to victory!"""
253,G. H. THOMPSON,
254,G. H. THOMPSON,
255,G. H. THOMPSON,
256,G. H. THOMPSON,
257,G. H. THOMPSON,The Advance Guard.
258,G. H. THOMPSON,
259,G. H. THOMPSON,
260,G. H. THOMPSON,Then marched they forth unto the fray
261,G. H. THOMPSON,A battle fierce took place next day;
262,G. H. THOMPSON,"I'm told it was a fearful fight,"
263,G. H. THOMPSON,That lasted quite from morn till night.
264,G. H. THOMPSON,
265,G. H. THOMPSON,"Through hail of shot and rain of lead,"
266,G. H. THOMPSON,His Rebel band the Tiger led;
267,G. H. THOMPSON,And found that when the fight was done
268,G. H. THOMPSON,A brilliant victory was won.
269,G. H. THOMPSON,
270,G. H. THOMPSON,In vain King Leo's gallant band
271,G. H. THOMPSON,(The Prince of Tails was in command)
272,G. H. THOMPSON,Essayed the Rebel force to beat--
273,G. H. THOMPSON,The effort ended in defeat.
274,G. H. THOMPSON,
275,G. H. THOMPSON,"Their cocoa-nuts, with deadly aim,"
276,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Monkeys threw, but all the same;"
277,G. H. THOMPSON,"Though Jumbo streams of water poured,"
278,G. H. THOMPSON,The enemy a victory scored.
279,G. H. THOMPSON,
280,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: THE FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE ENEMY]

282,G. H. THOMPSON,
283,G. H. THOMPSON,
284,G. H. THOMPSON,
285,G. H. THOMPSON,The Elephant Wounded.
286,G. H. THOMPSON,
287,G. H. THOMPSON,
288,G. H. THOMPSON,"Alas! for he so bravely fought,"
289,G. H. THOMPSON,Poor Jumbo wounded lay;
290,G. H. THOMPSON,The ambulance they quickly brought
291,G. H. THOMPSON,To where he fell that day.
292,G. H. THOMPSON,
293,G. H. THOMPSON,"""To Hospital this instant!"" cried"
294,G. H. THOMPSON,The Surgeon in command;
295,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Don't let them say he would have died"
296,G. H. THOMPSON,"If we'd not been at hand!"""
297,G. H. THOMPSON,
298,G. H. THOMPSON,"""But, wait,"" he said, ""till I with care"
299,G. H. THOMPSON,"Have quite examined him!"""
300,G. H. THOMPSON,"He probed him here, and probed him there,"
301,G. H. THOMPSON,And tested every limb.
302,G. H. THOMPSON,
303,G. H. THOMPSON,"""It's but a nervous shock!"" he said,"
304,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Since he's so large and fat;"
305,G. H. THOMPSON,"You can't take him, and so, instead,"
306,G. H. THOMPSON,"You'd better take his hat!"""
307,G. H. THOMPSON,
308,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: A WOUNDED HERO]
309,G. H. THOMPSON,
310,G. H. THOMPSON,"Ere dusk the King's troops had retreated,"
311,G. H. THOMPSON,By Tiger's Rebel band defeated;
312,G. H. THOMPSON,"They ran pell-mell and helter-skelter,"
313,G. H. THOMPSON,For any place to give them shelter.
314,G. H. THOMPSON,
315,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Elephant, though he was wounded,"
316,G. H. THOMPSON,Ran faster than the big Baboon did;
317,G. H. THOMPSON,The Owl to Camp flew like a bird
318,G. H. THOMPSON,To tell the King what had occurred.
319,G. H. THOMPSON,
320,G. H. THOMPSON,
321,G. H. THOMPSON,
322,G. H. THOMPSON,
323,G. H. THOMPSON,Rejoicings in the Rebel Camp
324,G. H. THOMPSON,
325,G. H. THOMPSON,
326,G. H. THOMPSON,Rejoicings in the Rebel Camp
327,G. H. THOMPSON,Were great indeed that night;
328,G. H. THOMPSON,Each tent hung out a Chinese lamp
329,G. H. THOMPSON,To celebrate the fight.
330,G. H. THOMPSON,
331,G. H. THOMPSON,"They sang and shouted, o'er and o'er,"
332,G. H. THOMPSON,Until their throats were tired;
333,G. H. THOMPSON,"They let off fireworks by the score,"
334,G. H. THOMPSON,"A ""feu de joie"" was fired."
335,G. H. THOMPSON,
336,G. H. THOMPSON,"When Wolf, who's not a marksman good,"
337,G. H. THOMPSON,"Shot holes in Bear's new hat,"
338,G. H. THOMPSON,"Bear never even said, ""You should"
339,G. H. THOMPSON,"Apologise for that!"""
340,G. H. THOMPSON,
341,G. H. THOMPSON,"In short, they would, as like as not,"
342,G. H. THOMPSON,Have kept it up till day;
343,G. H. THOMPSON,Had someone not found out they'd shot
344,G. H. THOMPSON,Their powder all away.
345,G. H. THOMPSON,
346,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: REJOICINGS IN THE REBEL CAMP]
347,G. H. THOMPSON,
348,G. H. THOMPSON,
349,G. H. THOMPSON,
350,G. H. THOMPSON,
351,G. H. THOMPSON,Marching on the King's Capital.
352,G. H. THOMPSON,
353,G. H. THOMPSON,
354,G. H. THOMPSON,"Next morn, with victory elate,"
355,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Why should we wait or hesitate?"
356,G. H. THOMPSON,"We'll march at once, without delay,"
357,G. H. THOMPSON,"Upon the Capital!"" cried they."
358,G. H. THOMPSON,
359,G. H. THOMPSON,"""That's _capital_!"" a Monkey said,"
360,G. H. THOMPSON,(But he at once was sent to bed!)
361,G. H. THOMPSON,"But, all the same, it was agreed,"
362,G. H. THOMPSON,So General Tiger took the lead.
363,G. H. THOMPSON,
364,G. H. THOMPSON,With flying flags and drums rat-tan
365,G. H. THOMPSON,The Rebels' onward march began.
366,G. H. THOMPSON,"Cried Tiger, ""Leoville one mile!"""
367,G. H. THOMPSON,"""That's nothing!"" said the Crocodile."
368,G. H. THOMPSON,
369,G. H. THOMPSON,"But Wolf, who kept a good look-out,"
370,G. H. THOMPSON,Saw Private Whiskers out on scout.
371,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Ha, ha,"" cried he, ""I've caught a spy--"
372,G. H. THOMPSON,"That means promotion by and by!"""
373,G. H. THOMPSON,
374,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: MARCHING ON THE KING'S CAPITAL]
375,G. H. THOMPSON,
376,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Great victory!"" said Wolf, with pride,"
377,G. H. THOMPSON,And showed his prize with rapture;
378,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Well done, indeed,"" the Tiger cried,"
379,G. H. THOMPSON,"""A most important capture!"""
380,G. H. THOMPSON,
381,G. H. THOMPSON,
382,G. H. THOMPSON,
383,G. H. THOMPSON,
384,G. H. THOMPSON,The Battle.
385,G. H. THOMPSON,
386,G. H. THOMPSON,
387,G. H. THOMPSON,Soon with the Lion's gallant troops
388,G. H. THOMPSON,The Rebels were engaged;
389,G. H. THOMPSON,"This way and that, 'midst wildest whoops"
390,G. H. THOMPSON,The tide of battle raged.
391,G. H. THOMPSON,
392,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Elephant first sounded ""Charge!"""
393,G. H. THOMPSON,And valiant deeds performed;
394,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Rebels saw his trunk so large,"
395,G. H. THOMPSON,And trembled when he stormed.
396,G. H. THOMPSON,
397,G. H. THOMPSON,"At first, though, neither side gained much;"
398,G. H. THOMPSON,"But when 'twas paw to paw,"
399,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Owl, in his report, said, ""Such"
400,G. H. THOMPSON,"A fight I never saw!"""
401,G. H. THOMPSON,
402,G. H. THOMPSON,"Said Wolf, ""No more at war I'll scoff,"
403,G. H. THOMPSON,"I think I'd best begone!"""
404,G. H. THOMPSON,And when the foe's last gun _went off_
405,G. H. THOMPSON,The battle still _went on_.
406,G. H. THOMPSON,
407,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: THE BATTLE]

412,G. H. THOMPSON,The Cavalry Charge.
413,G. H. THOMPSON,
414,G. H. THOMPSON,
415,G. H. THOMPSON,"But, oh! the finest sight to see"
416,G. H. THOMPSON,Was Leo's Giraffe Cavalry;
417,G. H. THOMPSON,"As down the battle plain they tore,"
418,G. H. THOMPSON,The Rebels saw that all was o'er.
419,G. H. THOMPSON,
420,G. H. THOMPSON,"As on the Monkey troopers swept,"
421,G. H. THOMPSON,The Bunnies to their holes all crept;
422,G. H. THOMPSON,The foe who set triumphant out
423,G. H. THOMPSON,"Was first a rabble, then a rout!"
424,G. H. THOMPSON,
425,G. H. THOMPSON,"The Owl, in ""Zooland,"" said, next day:"
426,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Our troops like chaff swept them away;"
427,G. H. THOMPSON,"Their praises let us loudly sing,"
428,G. H. THOMPSON,"Who won the day for Leo, King!"""
429,G. H. THOMPSON,
430,G. H. THOMPSON,[Illustration: THE CHARGE OF THE GIRAFFE CAVALRY]
431,G. H. THOMPSON,
432,G. H. THOMPSON,"The leader, Tiger, soon was caught,"
433,G. H. THOMPSON,And into Camp a prisoner brought;
434,G. H. THOMPSON,"A warning to this very day,"
435,G. H. THOMPSON,To all who at Rebellion play.
436,G. H. THOMPSON,
437,G. H. THOMPSON,

440,G. H. THOMPSON,The Court-Martial.
441,G. H. THOMPSON,
442,G. H. THOMPSON,
443,G. H. THOMPSON,Field Marshal Leo then and there
444,G. H. THOMPSON,A stern Court-Martial held;
445,G. H. THOMPSON,"The prisoner, with defiant air,"
446,G. H. THOMPSON,Explained why he rebelled.
447,G. H. THOMPSON,
448,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Such conduct,"" said the President,"
449,G. H. THOMPSON,"""Admits of no defence;"
450,G. H. THOMPSON,"But since you ask it, I'll consent"
451,G. H. THOMPSON,"To hear the evidence."""
452,G. H. THOMPSON,
453,G. H. THOMPSON,"'Twas heard--in ""Zooland"" of that week"
454,G. H. THOMPSON,You'll find the Owl's report;
