43,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"As the _Emperor Moth_[1] sat one evening in May,"
44,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Fanned by numberless wings in the moon's silver ray,"
45,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"While around him the zephyrs breathed sweetest perfume,"
46,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,Thus he spoke to his dwarf with the _Ragged white plume_:[2]
47,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"""That vain Butterfly's Ball, I hear, was most splendid,"
48,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And, as the world says, very fully attended,"
49,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Though she never asked us, but assigned as a cause,"
50,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,We were all much too heavy to gallope and waltz.
51,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"What impertinence this, want of grace to ascribe"
52,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,To the Lord of the whole Lepidopterous tribe;
53,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"I too'll give a ball, and such folks to chastise,"
54,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,I'll not be at home to these pert butterflies.
55,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Bid the _Empress_[3] come hither, and we'll talk about"

58,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,[Illustration: THE INVITATION.]
59,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,
60,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The Empress obeyed her lord's summons with speed,"
61,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And proceeded her visiting tablets to read,"
62,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That those of her subjects, whose homage was booked"
63,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"In that coveted record, might not be o'erlooked."
64,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Then the _Bufftip_[4] began to write each moth a card,"
65,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,Having one for herself just by way of reward.
66,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"""First ask,"" says the Emperor, ""the _Glory of Kent_,[5]"
67,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,On having much beauty my mind is quite bent;
68,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The _Belle_, too, _of Brixton_,[6] the _Marvel du Jour_,[7]"
69,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And the _Peach-blossom_[8] moth you'll invite, I am sure;"
70,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The _Sphinx_[9] too, shall come, who makes riddles so well,"
71,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,And the _Gipsey_[10] be ready our fortunes to tell;
72,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"_Mother Shipton_[11] shall chap'rone the lovely _Black I_,[12]"
73,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And those awkward Greek girls, _Lambda_,[13] _Gamma_,[14]"
74,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,and _Chi_;[15]
75,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"_Hebrew Character_,[16] too, who for routs has a passion;"
76,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And I'll ask Mrs. _Gothic_,[17] though she's out of fashion,"
77,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"For I love my old friends, and had rather that they"
78,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Should partake of our feast, than the idle and gay,"
79,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Who flutter about without object or reason,"
80,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Just live for an hour, and last but a season."""
81,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"How little, alas! do great moths bear in mind,"
82,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,That their tenure of life is of just the same kind.
83,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"""You're right,"" said the Empress, ""and truly 'twere shabby,"
84,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"T'exclude from our party poor old Mrs. _Tabby_,[18]"
85,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And the _Rustics_[19] I'll ask, though not one has a gown"
86,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"In which to appear, save of black, grey, or brown;"
87,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And some of them go, too, so feathered and flounced,"
88,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That the _Coxcomb_[20] called _Prominent_, on them pronounced"
89,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"A sentence of censure, quite just, but so tart,"
90,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That I felt, when I heard it, quite cut to the heart."
91,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"But now to proceed, Sire, the _Leopard_[21] I vote,"
92,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Be razed from our list, with that ugly old _Goat_,[22]"
93,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Who in youth made such terrible use of his jaws,"
94,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That I dread, I confess, e'en the sight of his claws;"
95,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And as to his muscles, 'tis said that when counted,"
96,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,To four thousand and just forty-one they amounted;
97,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Of Musk too, I'm told, he sheds such perfume,"
98,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That wherever he goes, he fills the whole room."
99,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Exclude him we will, with the old _Dromedary_,[23]"
100,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The _Elephant_[24] cunning, and _Fox_[25] too, so wary,"
101,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That though I don't know it for certain, I'm told"
102,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"They cheat at Ecart√©, like Hermes of old."
103,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,
104,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,[Illustration: THE DEATH'S HEAD MOTH.]
105,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,
106,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The _Ghost_[26] and _Death's head_,[27] and that terrible host,"
107,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Would but scare all the guests""--Here the Emperor lost,"
108,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"For a moment, his patience, and cried to his spouse,"
109,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"""If thus you proceed, ma'am, my anger you'll rouse."
110,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Like th' Egyptians of old, I'll have at my feast"
111,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"A figure of death, or his cross-bones at least,"
112,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,To remind all our guests of the limited span
113,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"That to moths is allotted, as well as to man,"
114,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And how e'en in the midst of enjoyment's gay hour,"
115,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,We are still in death's stern and inflexible power.
116,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"So let them have cards, and I'll go and prepare"
117,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"For receiving our friends, the best possible fare."""
118,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The Monarch then went with the _Eyed Hawk_,[28] his scout,"
119,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,To search for a spot fit for giving his rout;
120,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"A green ring he found, the work of a fairy,"
121,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And thinking it looked both commodious and airy,"
122,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"He called to him _Brimstone_[29] to measure the ground,"
123,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,For another _Geometra_[30] could not be found;
124,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Of this workman he knew the correctness full well,"
125,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,What he wrought was as nice as if done by a spell.
126,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The spot was judged proper, and erected in haste"
127,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Were some well fashioned rooms, which displayed his good taste."
128,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"_Carpet Moths_[31] were appointed to stencil the floor,"
129,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,The _Clothes Moths_[32] with gossamer covered the door;
130,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,_Mahogany_[33] and _Wainscot_[34] were neither deficient
131,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"In offering their aid, which proved most efficient,"
132,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"While _Veneers_,[35] both rosy and yellow, were able"
133,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"T'improve, by their help, the decayed supper table."
134,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"For the crockery, _China Mark_[36] promised to strive,"
135,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And _Galleria_[37] offered to steal from a hive,"
136,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Profusion of honey; _Pinguinalis_[38] brought butter,"
137,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,And with wax _Cereana_[39] came all in a flutter.
138,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"These presents the Emperor gladly accepted,"
139,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Save Galleria's theft, which with scorn was rejected,"
140,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,So little do moths of great minds patronise
141,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,The base who by fraud or extortion would rise.

144,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"_Puss_[41] sent an excuse, with the _Kitten_[42] engaged,"
145,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And the _Eggar_,[43] poor lady, was highly enraged"

147,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,Prevented her joining a party so rare.

153,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"They yielded to custom's imperious demand,"

164,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"He having been lamed by the awkward _Bulrush_,[59]"
165,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,To the serious alarm of the fair _Maiden's Blush_.[60]
166,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The day now arrived, and at nine of the night,"
167,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The glow-worm being hired the highways to light,"
168,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The guests 'gan to assemble, and each was announced"
169,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"By the _Herald_,[61] who loudly their names all pronounced."

172,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Some in _Muslin_,[63] some _Satin_,[64] were chastely arrayed,"
173,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"While the _Emerald_,[65] the _Pearl_,[66] and the _Mocha_[67]"
174,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,displayed

184,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"How she caught as she came a most violent cold,"
185,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And felt such oppression and pain in her throat,"
186,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,That she scarcely dared venture to utter a note;
187,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"And thus with most Misses of human creation,"
188,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,How often their colds are but mere affectation.
189,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"The dancing began, and soft music was heard,"
190,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Provided, 'twas said, by the sweet _Humming Bird_.[75]"

194,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Who, aided by Mars, the young lady had caught,"

227,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Old _Drinker_,[99] the butler, of wine served the best,"

248,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"Meanwhile came the _Sweep_,[105] with the _Chimney Sweep's Boy_,[106]"

351,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"trees, and has, according to Lyonet, 4041 muscles. It is three"
352,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,years before the insect attains its perfect state. The
353,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"caterpillar emits a smell much resembling that of musk, and Ray"
354,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"and Linn√¶us both supposed it to be the Cossus mentioned by Pliny,"
355,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,as fattened with flour by the Roman epicures for their tables.

365,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"happens, they dexterously turn themselves on their backs, make"
366,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"head and tail meet, and float in this posture till they can"
367,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,contrive to save themselves by clinging to some part of the
368,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,plant. They possess the power of drawing the head and three
369,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,first joints within the body at pleasure. The moth flies very

376,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"brilliant white, but the female is yellow. It is fond of feeding"
377,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"on the roots of grass, and from having been often found in"
378,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"church-yards, the tradition has arisen that it inhabits those"
379,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"spots only. The caterpillar is very destructive to hops, by"

385,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,messenger of pestilence and death. When touched it utters a
386,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"plaintive cry, like that of a bat or mouse. Reaumur says, that a"
387,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"whole convent in France was thrown into consternation, by one of"
388,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"these moths flying into the dormitory. It frequently robs hives,"
389,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"and Huber states, that its cry renders the bees motionless. It"
390,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,breaks from its chrysalis between four and seven in the
391,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"afternoon, as the Hawk moth of the Lime always appears at noon,"

399,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,
400,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,[30] This genus is so called from the peculiar manner in which the
401,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,caterpillar moves; it brings the feet of both extremities close
402,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"together, and the intermediate part of the body rises like an"
403,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"arch, giving it the appearance of measuring the distance it"
404,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"performs. It is said to possess great muscular powers, for it"
405,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"will attach its posterior feet to the twig of a tree, and erect"

413,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,their eggs on the substances which serve them for food. The most
414,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,effectual method of keeping them away is to pack the materials

444,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,
445,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,[41] _Cerura vinula._--The caterpillar of the Puss has the power of
446,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"stretching out, or pulling back its head at will, according to"
447,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,its apprehension of danger. Its hinder extremity never touches
448,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"the ground, but is furnished with two tubes, through which the"
449,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,insect ejects a thin liquor at its pursuers. When near the
450,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"change into the pupa state, however, the tubes dry up, and it"
451,THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.,"loses this faculty. More male than female moths are to be found,"
