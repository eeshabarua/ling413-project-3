47,MONKEY JACK.,See how he leaps from bough to bough

121,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"Rain, rain, rain! How it did rain! The great drops ran down the glass in"
122,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"streams. Tom, Jack, and lit-tle Meg watched it for a long time. ""O dear!"""
123,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"they said at last, ""do you think it will nev-er clear? We want to go out"

130,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"That struck them as a fine plan; and off they trooped, pound-ing up"
131,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"the bare stairs with their nois-y feet. They found three old brooms,"
132,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"and be-gan to play soldier,--Tom first, then Jack, with Meg last of"
133,A RAIN-Y DAY.,all. The gar-ret was ver-y large; and their mam-ma could hear them
134,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"as they tramped a-long, and could hear Tom's com-mand to right a-bout"
135,A RAIN-Y DAY.,face when they had reached the farth-er end.
136,A RAIN-Y DAY.,
137,A RAIN-Y DAY.,By and by they tired of play-ing sol-dier; and then they pulled down
138,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"some old dress-es and hats that hung on a peg, and put them on, and"
139,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"made be-lieve that they were grown peo-ple. Then, out of an old box,"
140,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"they dragged a scrap-book full of pic-tures, and sat them down to"
141,A RAIN-Y DAY.,look them o-ver.

144,A RAIN-Y DAY.,
145,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"Mean-time their friend Rose had come, all wrapped up, through the"

148,A RAIN-Y DAY.,
149,A RAIN-Y DAY.,"""The chil-dren are in the gar-ret,"" said their mam-ma."

276,THE HARD LESSON.,The ver-y next day their mam-ma did take them. They found Ruth sit-ting
277,THE HARD LESSON.,"pil-lowed up in a chair, ver-y pale and white. Bell had picked her a"
278,THE HARD LESSON.,"bunch of flow-ers, which she seemed ver-y glad to get; and the three"
279,THE HARD LESSON.,girls soon be-came good friends. Car-ree found a lit-tle gray kitten
280,THE HARD LESSON.,with which she played.
281,THE HARD LESSON.,
282,THE HARD LESSON.,The vis-it seemed to do Ruth a great deal of good; for a pink flush came
283,THE HARD LESSON.,"in her cheeks, and she e-ven laughed, which her moth-er said she had not"
284,THE HARD LESSON.,done before for weeks.
285,THE HARD LESSON.,
286,THE HARD LESSON.,"They came a-gain the ver-y next day. Miss Gray was with them, and car-ried"
287,THE HARD LESSON.,a bas-ket on her arm in which were some dain-ties to tempt the sick girl's
288,THE HARD LESSON.,"ap-pe-tite. She was glad to see them, and told them they should have the"
289,THE HARD LESSON.,kit-ten for their ver-y own. So pus-sy went back in the bas-ket which had
290,THE HARD LESSON.,brought the dain-ties.
291,THE HARD LESSON.,
292,THE HARD LESSON.,"Near-ly ev-er-y day af-ter this the chil-dren went to see Ruth, for at"

422,AGRIPPA.,such a pret-ty lit-tle cat as to be made a great pet and used to trot
423,AGRIPPA.,a-bout af-ter the peo-ple like a lit-tle dog. His name was A-grip-pa
424,AGRIPPA.,and he knew it quite well.
425,AGRIPPA.,
426,AGRIPPA.,"To this farm-house came a boy and girl named Ned and Lau-ra, to spend the"
427,AGRIPPA.,sum-mer. Both were fond of pets and both played so much with A-grip-pa
428,AGRIPPA.,that he grew rath-er la-zy and did not try to catch ma-ny mice.
429,AGRIPPA.,
430,AGRIPPA.,"Ned and Lau-ra were ver-y good friends, but it happened now and then that"
431,AGRIPPA.,"both want-ed the same thing and then, sad to say, some loud words might"
432,AGRIPPA.,"be heard. Ned would say, ""Give me Grip-pa,"" and Lau-ra would an-swer,"
433,AGRIPPA.,"""You shan't have Grip-pa!"" and Ned would say a-gain, ""I will have Grip-pa,"""
434,AGRIPPA.,and so it would go on till some-times poor Grip-pa would run a-way. But
435,AGRIPPA.,they al-ways made up and were friends a-gain.
436,AGRIPPA.,
437,AGRIPPA.,"Grip-pa grew up a large, fine cat, and lived some years. But he was at"
438,AGRIPPA.,"length taken ill. He came no more to the house, but stayed in the barn"
439,AGRIPPA.,"and grew ver-y weak, till he could hard-ly walk. At last, one day he"
440,AGRIPPA.,"came walk-ing fee-bly to the house. He went in-to the kitch-en, then"
441,AGRIPPA.,"to the pan-try, then to the din-ing room. In-to all the rooms went"
442,AGRIPPA.,"Grip-pa, and in each room sat down and looked a-round, as if tak-ing"
443,AGRIPPA.,a last fare-well; then slow-ly walked out of doors. It was in-deed his
444,AGRIPPA.,last vis-it. Next morn-ing poor Grip-pa was found dead.

454,FRANK'S BOY.,"Frank More had been out skat-ing near-ly the whole af-ter-noon, for there"
455,FRANK'S BOY.,"was no school this week, and the ice was in fine or-der. It was al-most"
456,FRANK'S BOY.,"dark, and he was go-ing home, skates in hand, when a poor boy a-bout as"
457,FRANK'S BOY.,large as him-self came up and be-gan to beg from him.
458,FRANK'S BOY.,
459,FRANK'S BOY.,[Illustration]
460,FRANK'S BOY.,
461,FRANK'S BOY.,"""Go home with me,"" said Frank, ""and you shall have some sup-per."""
462,FRANK'S BOY.,
463,FRANK'S BOY.,"The boy went glad-ly, and on the way Frank asked him ma-ny ques-tions."
464,FRANK'S BOY.,"When they ar-rived, Frank took him to the kitch-en, where Jane the cook"
465,FRANK'S BOY.,"gave him a warm seat and plen-ty of sup-per, for his thin face made her"
466,FRANK'S BOY.,feel sor-ry.
467,FRANK'S BOY.,
468,FRANK'S BOY.,"When Frank had seen him com-fort-a-bly set-tled, he went up stairs to"
469,FRANK'S BOY.,tell his fa-ther and moth-er a-bout the lad.
470,FRANK'S BOY.,
471,FRANK'S BOY.,"""Don't you think, fa-ther,"" he said, ""that grand-pa would like such a"
472,FRANK'S BOY.,"boy? He says he will be glad to work, and if moth-er will let me give"
473,FRANK'S BOY.,"him my old suit, I can take him to see grand-pa in the morning."""
474,FRANK'S BOY.,
475,FRANK'S BOY.,"""Well, Frank, you may try,"" said his fa-ther. So poor Sam had a good"
476,FRANK'S BOY.,"bed to sleep in that night, and next morn-ing the two boys went to see"
477,FRANK'S BOY.,a-bout work for him. Dressed in the warm clothes Frank's moth-er gave
478,FRANK'S BOY.,"him, he looked like quite a dif-fer-ent boy, and was ve-ry grate-ful"
479,FRANK'S BOY.,for her kind-ness.
480,FRANK'S BOY.,
481,FRANK'S BOY.,It was soon set-tled that Sam should live at old Mr. More's. He had a
482,FRANK'S BOY.,"good ma-ny things to do: to help take care of the chick-ens, the sheep"
483,FRANK'S BOY.,"and lambs, the cows and horses; and be-sides all this, he went to school,"
484,FRANK'S BOY.,"and with all the other boys, had great fun at coast-ing and skat-ing when"
485,FRANK'S BOY.,"school was out. But he worked as well as he played, and proved so trust-y,"
486,FRANK'S BOY.,"that grand-ma said: ""Frank's boy was a boy worth hav-ing."""
487,FRANK'S BOY.,
488,FRANK'S BOY.,So Sam found a good home and Frank had the pleas-ure of know-ing that he
489,FRANK'S BOY.,had helped one boy to be both use-ful and hap-py.

496,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
497,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,Jo-ey Hart was a boy who was sent by his fath-er to spend the sum-mer
498,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"with an un-cle in the coun-try. Jo-ey had been ill, and the doc-tor"
499,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,said that there was noth-ing like coun-try air to make him well a-gain.
500,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
501,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"So he set off one bright morn-ing, and be-fore night was safe at his"
502,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,un-cle's farm. His pa-pa had thought that Jo-ey might go to school
503,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"dur-ing the sum-mer, but when the doc-tor heard of it he said no."
504,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"""Let the boy run wild for three months. He will learn twice as fast"
505,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"next win-ter."""
506,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
507,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,He was wild with joy when he was at last at his un-cle's. He was so
508,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"hun-gry, and the bread and but-ter and milk tast-ed so nice-ly, that"
509,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,he thought he should nev-er have e-nough. Each day he was up with the
510,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"sun, and by night had played so hard that al-most be-fore it was dark"
511,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,he was read-y to go to bed.
512,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
513,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,It was great fun to watch the men in the fields at work. Some-times his
514,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"un-cle let him ride the mow-ing ma-chine, and at such times he was ve-ry"
515,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,proud. Then it was ve-ry ex-cit-ing to ride on the top of a great sway-ing
516,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"load of hay, right in on to the barn floor."
517,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
518,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"La-ter on, when the hay was all gath-ered, the wheat be-gan to rip-en,"
519,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,and the men were bu-sy cut-ting it and gath-er-ing it in-to sheaves. The
520,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"birds act-ed as if they thought it was cut for them on-ly, for they came"
521,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,in such swarms that it looked as if they would eat it all and leave none
522,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,for the farm-er.
523,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
524,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,[Illustration]
525,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
526,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,Some-times his aunt would ask him to take their lunch-eon to the men
527,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"at work in the fields, for dur-ing hay-ing and har-vest when the work"
528,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,is heav-i-est the men al-ways have a lunch at ten in the morn-ing.
529,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
530,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,Now on one day when Jo-ey took his bas-ket and left the house for the
531,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"fields, he got him-self in-to trou-ble, and this was the way. Close by"
532,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,his un-cle's house on the main street lived a gen-tle-man who had a
533,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,fine gar-den. All a-round it was a high fence and a no-tice was post-ed
534,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"up, ""Tres-pas-sers will be pros-e-cu-ted."" That no-tice was be-cause"
535,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"the school house was not far a-way, and the boys some-times helped"
536,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,them-selves to the old gen-tle-man's ap-ples.
537,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
538,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"Jo-ey had to pass di-rect-ly by the gar-den wall, and it so hap-pened"
539,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,that his bas-ket was heav-y and he set it down to rest.
540,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
541,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,What took place you can see in the pic-ture on the next page bet-ter
542,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"than I can tell you. Jo-ey got the ap-ples but a bad fall, and when"
543,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,he went to get up he found that he could not stand and that one an-kle
544,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,hurt him se-vere-ly.
545,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
546,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"How long he would have staid there I can not tell, had not the men in"
547,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,the field grown hun-gry and sent one of their num-ber to see what had
548,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,be-come of their lunch.
549,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
550,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"The mes-sen-ger found Jo-ey, and picked him up and car-ried him home."
551,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"Then, com-ing back, he took the bas-ket and all the ap-ples that lay"
552,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,"a-bout, and went back to the field and the men ate them all for lunch-eon."
553,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,
554,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,And so Jo-ey not on-ly got no ap-ples but had to lie in bed for a week
555,JOEY'S EXPLOIT.,be-fore his an-kle got well e-nough for him to run a-bout a-gain.
