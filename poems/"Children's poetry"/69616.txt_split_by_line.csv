59,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
60,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“Well, John, have you succeeded, to-day, my son?”"
61,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
62,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“No, mother; I have been nearly all over the town, and no one would"
63,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"take me. But I think if you had been with me, I should have stood a"
64,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"better chance. You look so thin and pale, mother, somebody would"
65,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"have felt sorry, and so have taken me; but nobody knew me, and no one"
66,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,saw you.”
67,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
68,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"It was a cold, bleak night, and John had been out all day, “looking"
69,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"for a place.” He had tried hard, until it was quite dark, and then"
70,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"gave up, thinking his mother must be tired of waiting for him."
71,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
72,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"John’s mother was a widow, and a very poor one. She had kept herself"
73,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"by needle-work, till a severe trial of sickness had confined her to"
74,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"her bed, and she was unable to do more. She told her little son to"
75,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"sit down by the fire, while she got him some food. The fire and the"
76,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,supper were very scanty; but John knew they were the best she could
77,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"provide, and he felt that he would rather share such a fire and such"
78,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"a supper with so kind a mother, than sit at the best-filled table"
79,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"with any body else who did not love him as she did, and whom he did"
80,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,not love as he did her.
81,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
82,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"After a few moments of silence, the boy looked up into his mother’s"
83,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"face, and said, “Mother, do you think it would be wrong to ask my new"
84,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"Sabbath school teacher about a place?” “No, my child, not if you have"
85,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"no other time, and I think that he would be a very proper person;"
86,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"at least, I should think that he would be interested in getting you"
87,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"a good place.” “Well, to-morrow is Sabbath day, and when the class"
88,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"breaks up, I will ask him.”"
89,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
90,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"After reading a portion of God’s holy word, the mother and her little"
91,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,boy kneeled down together to pray. She asked God to bless them with
92,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"his Holy Spirit, that they might truly repent of sin, and through"
93,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"faith in Jesus Christ, obtain pardon. She prayed that God would care"
94,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"for them as a father, give them his rich grace, and do that which he"
95,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"knew to be best for them, for Christ’s sake."
96,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
97,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“I feel happier now,” said John; “I was so tired when I came in that"
98,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"I felt quite sad;—did I look so, mother?” The mother’s heart was"
99,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"full, and she gave her boy a kiss, which was sweeter to him than many"
100,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,words.
101,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
102,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,Next morning was the Lord’s day. John’s breakfast was more scanty
103,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"than ever; but he said not a word about that, for he saw that his"
104,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,mother ate very little of it. But one or two sticks of wood were left
105,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"outside the door where it was kept, and he knew that both food and"
106,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,fire might all be gone before night. They had earned no money to buy
107,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"any thing for several days. The sun was shining bright and clear,"
108,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,but the air was very cold. The child had no overcoat; but hastening
109,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"to the school, he was in his seat just as the superintendent and his"
110,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,teacher entered.
111,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
112,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,“Who is that little pale-faced boy in your class?” asked the
113,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,superintendent of the teacher. “His name is Jones. I intend to visit
114,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,him this very week. He is a well-behaved boy.” “I should like to
115,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"know more about him,” said the superintendent, “and I will speak to"
116,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,him after school.”
117,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
118,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"The superintendent did not forget him, and when the class broke up,"
119,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"seeing him linger behind the other scholars, went up and spoke to him"
120,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"kindly. “You have been here to school several Sundays, have you not,"
121,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"my boy?” “Yes, sir; I came just a month ago to-day.” “Had you ever"
122,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"been to school before that time?” “Yes, sir; before mother was taken"
123,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"sick, I used to go to another school; but that was a great way off,"
124,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"and when mother got well, and you opened this new school, she brought"
125,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,me here.”
126,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
127,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“Well, did I not see you yesterday, looking for a place in Water"
128,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"Street?” “I was down there, sir, looking for a place.” “Why did you"
129,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,not take that place which the gentleman had for you in the large
130,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"shop?” “Because, sir, they kept open shop on the Sabbath, and mother"
131,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,would not wish me to work on the Lord’s day.”
132,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
133,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,“You did not keep the piece of gold money that you found on the
134,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"floor, as you were coming into the street; why didn’t you?” “Because"
135,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"it was not mine, sir; and I thought that the gentleman of the shop"
136,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,would find the owner sooner than I should.”
137,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
138,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“He did, my boy,—it was my money. Did you not get a place yesterday?”"
139,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"“No, sir; all the places were full, and nobody knew me.” “Well, my"
140,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"boy, you may go now, and tell your mother that you have a place. Come"
141,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,to me very early in the morning—your teacher will tell you where I
142,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,live.”
143,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,
144,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"John went home with his heart and his eyes so full, that he could"
145,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"hardly see the street, or any thing as he went along. He knew that"
146,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"it would cheer his dear mother very much, and so it did. That Sunday"
147,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"evening John and his mother knelt down together, and with tears of"
148,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,"joy, they gave thanks to God, who had not forgotten the fatherless"
149,JOHN IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.,and the widow in their distress.

157,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
158,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
159,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"Willie Mortimer was a kind and affectionate little boy, but he"
160,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"possessed a hasty temper, which was ever leading him into some harm."
161,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"Here, you see, it has just led him into trouble. In trying to get his"
162,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"mother’s work box away from his sister, he has dropped it, and all"
163,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,the things have rolled about the floor.
164,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
165,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,His mother often urged him to strive to govern it; and the big tears
166,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"would dampen his little cheeks, as he reflected upon the misdemeanors"
167,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,which his temper ever urged him to commit. He repented quickly of
168,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"his errors, but somehow, he could not “_think enough_,” before his"
169,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"temper had conquered him. He often desired to overcome it, but felt"
170,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,discouraged sometimes.
171,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
172,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"One day, after much enjoyment, he came to his aunt, with whom he was"
173,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"staying, and said,—"
174,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
175,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"“O, I’ve been so happy, and got along so well to-day, without getting"
176,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,angry!”
177,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
178,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"“How so?” exclaimed his aunt, as she smoothed his brown locks."
179,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
180,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"“I prayed this morning, before I came out of my room, and said, ‘Lead"
181,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"us not into temptation;’ and I think God hears my prayer, and helps"
182,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"me to be good,” said Willie."
183,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
184,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"A subdued light shone from Willie’s dark eyes, as he so confidingly"
185,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,reposed in grace and help from Heaven to overcome his waywardness.
186,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
187,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"The sun bade the children all, yea, and the fair earth, his"
188,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"accustomed “good night,” while Willie still remained a conqueror over"
189,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"his temper. As he clasped his hands in his evening prayer, he thanked"
190,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"God for not leading him into temptation, and with abiding faith in"
191,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"the great Being of love, he laid him down to sleep."
192,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,
193,LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION.,"My dear young friends, we all are surrounded with temptation, and"

237,BIRDS.,"The birds, the dear, beautiful birds, that come in the sweet spring"
238,BIRDS.,time to build their nests among the fresh green leaves and fragrant
239,BIRDS.,blossoms of our home trees! How glad we are to see them! The little
240,BIRDS.,children love the birds. No _kind_ and _gentle_ boy will rob their
241,BIRDS.,pretty eggs or their tender young. But you may be happy in watching
242,BIRDS.,"their graceful forms and varied colors, as they glide through the air"
243,BIRDS.,"or hop about on the ground. Our heavenly Father made them, and they"
244,BIRDS.,"praise him in their many toned songs. He feeds them, and teaches us"
245,BIRDS.,thus to trust in his care. The God that provides for the birds will
246,BIRDS.,"not forget you, for the Saviour says, “Ye are of more value than many"
247,BIRDS.,sparrows.”
248,BIRDS.,
249,BIRDS.,I always like to see children making acquaintance with the birds. If
250,BIRDS.,"they watch their habits, they will learn some important lessons. I"
251,BIRDS.,have been interested in some observations which a little friend of
252,BIRDS.,"mine has recently made, and which she has told in her first school"
253,BIRDS.,composition. It is as follows:—
254,BIRDS.,
255,BIRDS.,"“My dear Schoolmates,—I would like to tell you a story. A little"
256,BIRDS.,"chipping bird built a nest on a peach tree, near our kitchen window."
257,BIRDS.,"It was a soft, pretty nest, lined with hair. A naughty little wren,"
258,BIRDS.,"wishing to build herself a nest, instead of looking about to find"
259,BIRDS.,"straws and hair, comes every day and takes them from the chipping"
260,BIRDS.,bird’s nest. I think I shall not love her as much as I did before. I
261,BIRDS.,"think I shall call her a little _thief_, instead of a little wren. I"
262,BIRDS.,"think little children should learn a lesson from the birds, and not"
263,BIRDS.,"take what does not belong to them, for they will be called thieves,"
264,BIRDS.,and no one will love them if they do.”

274,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
275,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
276,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"What a beautiful creature is the gaudy butterfly! Children, you do"
277,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"not wish to crush its golden wings, and destroy its brief, sunny"
278,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"life. O, no; you had rather see it free and happy. How cruel and"
279,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,wicked it is for children to destroy these beautiful creatures which
280,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,God has made!
281,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
282,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,Here is a story in regard to a little boy and a butterfly.
283,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
284,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"“I was walking along through a pretty village, one summer day. The"
285,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,cottages were covered with woodbines and roses. The bees were busy
286,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"carrying home honey to the hives, while the children were playing"
287,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,about so happily. I was thinking how soon the bright summer would be
288,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"gone, and the leaves fallen from the trees, when a little boy ran by,"
289,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"chasing a beautiful butterfly. I was sorry to see him soon catch it,"
290,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,and hold it fast in his hand. I asked him if he knew how cruel and
291,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"unkind it was. He said,—"
292,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
293,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"“No, ma’am; I wanted it, to take home and put under a glass; it looks"
294,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,so very pretty. I did not know it would hurt it.”
295,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
296,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"But when I told him how much pain it gave the poor creature, he"
297,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,opened his little hand to let the butterfly escape.
298,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
299,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"Alas! poor thing, it was so hurt it could not fly at all; so we were"
300,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"obliged to kill it, to put it out of pain. The little boy was very"
301,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,sorry; so were the other children who had gathered round.
302,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
303,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"Then I showed them the dust upon the wing, and told them if we could"
304,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"only see it distinctly, how it would look almost like feathers, and"
305,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,how it hurt the poor creature to have it brushed off. I explained
306,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"to them about the caterpillar, and that some of them spin beautiful"
307,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"webs, and then come the butterflies, which fly about in the bright"
308,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"sunshine, but die when winter comes."
309,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
310,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"Then we talked about the great God, who made all these beautiful"
311,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"creatures, and how he loved dear children to be kind to one another,"
312,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,and to poor dumb animals that could not tell when they were in pain.
313,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,
314,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"Children may run about the fields, and gather the beautiful flowers,"
315,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,and bright green ferns; which the little boys and girls said they
316,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"would do, and never catch butterflies any more, but only watch them"
317,INSECT LIFE AND ITS LESSON.,"fly about, so happily basking in the sunshine.”"

325,THE TWO PICTURES.,
326,THE TWO PICTURES.,
327,THE TWO PICTURES.,"Will you look at two pictures, and see if either one belongs to you?"
328,THE TWO PICTURES.,
329,THE TWO PICTURES.,"The first is of a little boy. I will not tell you his name, nor his"
330,THE TWO PICTURES.,"age, nor where he lived, nor who are his parents. I am sure he would"
331,THE TWO PICTURES.,"not like to be known; but I must tell you about him, that you may"
332,THE TWO PICTURES.,"avoid his faults, and take good warning by his conduct."
333,THE TWO PICTURES.,
334,THE TWO PICTURES.,"This little boy has a kind mother, and she wishes that he should grow"
335,THE TWO PICTURES.,"up to be a useful and pious young man. Yet, sad to tell, he does not"
336,THE TWO PICTURES.,"himself care to do right, or to obey his parents, or to please God."
337,THE TWO PICTURES.,There can be no doubt that he has a very hard and wicked heart; for
338,THE TWO PICTURES.,"when he is naughty, and grieves his mother, he does not care for her"
339,THE TWO PICTURES.,"tears. And when he is told of a fault, he is stubborn, and will not"
340,THE TWO PICTURES.,"ask to be forgiven, nor show any desire to amend."
341,THE TWO PICTURES.,
342,THE TWO PICTURES.,"Our Lord Jesus Christ, who came into the world to die for sinners,"
343,THE TWO PICTURES.,was once a little child. He has left a pattern for children who wish
344,THE TWO PICTURES.,to be like him. As a child he was “subject in all things.” He never
345,THE TWO PICTURES.,"grieved his mother’s heart by a sullen or evil temper, nor made her"
346,THE TWO PICTURES.,"shed a tear by any unkind conduct. O, how much did Mary love the holy"
347,THE TWO PICTURES.,child Jesus! But the little boy of whom we write does not wish to
348,THE TWO PICTURES.,be like Jesus. He does not love to hear about him as a kind Saviour.
349,THE TWO PICTURES.,"I do not think he ever truly prays to God to change his hard heart,"
350,THE TWO PICTURES.,"and to give him the grace of his Holy Spirit, that he may be a better"
351,THE TWO PICTURES.,"child. He may say his prayers, but he does not really pray, for he"
352,THE TWO PICTURES.,"does not mean what he says, but is looking about him all the time he"
353,THE TWO PICTURES.,"is on his knees, or is thinking of something else."
354,THE TWO PICTURES.,
355,THE TWO PICTURES.,"What is to become of this little boy, if he does not seek for grace"
356,THE TWO PICTURES.,to turn him from his evil ways? He will certainly grow worse. He will
357,THE TWO PICTURES.,walk in the path of the wicked all the days he lives on earth; and
358,THE TWO PICTURES.,"then, when he dies, how sad will his end be!"
359,THE TWO PICTURES.,
360,THE TWO PICTURES.,"Now, let us look at another picture. It is that of a little boy who"
361,THE TWO PICTURES.,"obeys his parents, because it is right, because they love him, and"
362,THE TWO PICTURES.,"because God has said, “Honor thy father and thy mother;” one who is"
363,THE TWO PICTURES.,as careful to obey them when out of sight as when under their eye.
364,THE TWO PICTURES.,There are several lads seen standing at the corner of a street. One
365,THE TWO PICTURES.,proposes to the rest that they should all go and see the people on
366,THE TWO PICTURES.,"their way to the flower show. “O, yes! capital! so we will!” they"
367,THE TWO PICTURES.,"all cried. “But, see, here is William Hall coming; let us ask him"
368,THE TWO PICTURES.,"to go with us.” Then they said, “Come with us, William, and see the"
369,THE TWO PICTURES.,"gentlemen and ladies at the flower show.” “Yes,” said William, “if my"
370,THE TWO PICTURES.,"mother will give me leave: I will run and ask her.” “O, O! the baby!”"
371,THE TWO PICTURES.,they shouted aloud; “so you must run and ask your mother!” “I did not
372,THE TWO PICTURES.,"ask my mother,” said one boy. “Nor I,” said two or three more. “Come"
373,THE TWO PICTURES.,"along with us,” they still said, “if you do not want to be called a"
374,THE TWO PICTURES.,coward as long as you live. Do you not see we are all waiting?”
375,THE TWO PICTURES.,
376,THE TWO PICTURES.,"William stood with one foot forward, and a flush on his face. Tears"
377,THE TWO PICTURES.,"came into his eyes, as he heard the word “coward.” Now was the time"
378,THE TWO PICTURES.,"to see if he was brave enough to be called a coward, rather than do"
379,THE TWO PICTURES.,"wrong. “I _will not_ go without I first ask my mother,” said he,"
380,THE TWO PICTURES.,"firmly, “and I am no coward either. I promised that I would not go"
381,THE TWO PICTURES.,out of the street without she gave me leave; and I should be a coward
382,THE TWO PICTURES.,"if I were to tell a wicked lie.” The rest now ran away, mocking"
383,THE TWO PICTURES.,and shouting; and William went quietly to his home. In the evening
384,THE TWO PICTURES.,"William was seen, with a happy face, taking a pleasant walk along"
385,THE TWO PICTURES.,with his dear mother.
386,THE TWO PICTURES.,
387,THE TWO PICTURES.,"Will you look at these two pictures, and see if you can find your"
388,THE TWO PICTURES.,own likeness in either? Are you like the boy who does not honor his
389,THE TWO PICTURES.,"parents? Then you do not fear God nor obey his word, and he is angry"
390,THE TWO PICTURES.,"with you every day. Or, are you like him who would rather have the"
391,THE TWO PICTURES.,scorn and bad name of the rude lads than disobey his mother?

399,A BAD SIGN.,This boy is trying to get that poor dog into the water.[1] He seems
400,A BAD SIGN.,to delight in tormenting the poor creature.
401,A BAD SIGN.,
402,A BAD SIGN.,"Now, this is a bad sign. It is a bad sign for a boy to be seen"
403,A BAD SIGN.,"throwing stones at every dog, or pig, or bird he sees in the street."
404,A BAD SIGN.,It shows that such a boy has an unfeeling heart. He does not care how
405,A BAD SIGN.,"much suffering he may cause a poor, innocent bird, or animal. What if"
406,A BAD SIGN.,he breaks a wing or a leg—he only laughs at the agony which he has
407,A BAD SIGN.,caused.
408,A BAD SIGN.,
409,A BAD SIGN.,"Boys, never cultivate such a cruel disposition. Never cause any"
410,A BAD SIGN.,"thing, that has feelings, pain, if you can possibly help it. I am"
411,A BAD SIGN.,"afraid if you begin with tormenting the poor, innocent brutes, you"
412,A BAD SIGN.,"can, after a while, injure your playmates and associates. Some have"
413,A BAD SIGN.,already been seen to throw stones at poor boys just for the fun of
414,A BAD SIGN.,"it, or rather, to gratify the evil disposition of their hearts. Ah!"
415,A BAD SIGN.,"many men have been hung for murder, or sent to the state’s prison,"
416,A BAD SIGN.,just because they cultivated such bad dispositions when they were
417,A BAD SIGN.,"boys like you. They commenced becoming cruel to animals first, and"
418,A BAD SIGN.,"then to other boys, and so, little by little, their hearts became"
419,A BAD SIGN.,"hardened, till they could even kill a man. Think of this the next"
420,A BAD SIGN.,time you are tempted to pick up a stone to throw at any innocent
421,A BAD SIGN.,thing that has life and feeling.

436,THE PENKNIFE.,
437,THE PENKNIFE.,
438,THE PENKNIFE.,Charles Hart had once the folly to steal his father’s penknife; he
439,THE PENKNIFE.,had sold it for six cents to one of his schoolfellows; and he had
440,THE PENKNIFE.,"employed the money in purchasing cherries, which he ate with much"
441,THE PENKNIFE.,appetite.
442,THE PENKNIFE.,
443,THE PENKNIFE.,"But this little pleasure, which lasted but a few minutes, was"
444,THE PENKNIFE.,"followed by sorrow and regret, that continued a long time."
445,THE PENKNIFE.,
446,THE PENKNIFE.,"In short, Charles’s theft was not long in being found out. His"
447,THE PENKNIFE.,"schoolfellow’s father, having seen the penknife in his son’s hand,"
448,THE PENKNIFE.,"and having learned of whom he had bought it, sent it back immediately"
449,THE PENKNIFE.,"to Charles’s father, with a polite message to know if he had given"
450,THE PENKNIFE.,his son leave to sell it.
451,THE PENKNIFE.,
452,THE PENKNIFE.,You may easily conjecture that young Charles was severely punished;
453,THE PENKNIFE.,but the punishment which he received from his father was trifling in
454,THE PENKNIFE.,comparison with what followed.
455,THE PENKNIFE.,
456,THE PENKNIFE.,All those who lived in the same house with him suspected him the
457,THE PENKNIFE.,moment that they happened to miss any thing; and each accused him of
458,THE PENKNIFE.,"having taken it. They rummaged his pockets, room, books, and carried"
459,THE PENKNIFE.,"their suspicions so far, as to inquire at the school where Charles"
460,THE PENKNIFE.,"went, if he had not shown any suspicious thing there."
461,THE PENKNIFE.,
462,THE PENKNIFE.,Judge if this sort of distrust did not cause him uneasiness. He
463,THE PENKNIFE.,often cried most bitterly at the injustice they did him; though he
464,THE PENKNIFE.,felt that he had but too well deserved it. Let him say what he would
465,THE PENKNIFE.,"of their wronging him, or let him assert that he was incapable of"
466,THE PENKNIFE.,"doing what they accused him of, they did not continue to mistrust him"
467,THE PENKNIFE.,"the less; nor was it till after many years, and that he had given"
468,THE PENKNIFE.,"strong proofs of his amendment, that the people with whom he lived"
469,THE PENKNIFE.,restored him their confidence.

483,THE LAME BOY.,grass as you drive along your hoop. But let me tell you of one who
484,THE LAME BOY.,"can never run and jump. When the busy hours of school are passed, and"
485,THE LAME BOY.,"his little companions shout and toss their hats in air, with the"
486,THE LAME BOY.,"wild joy of boyhood, _he_ stands apart from the busy throng; the same"
487,THE LAME BOY.,"quiet, patient look ever rests on his face, he moves slowly along"
488,THE LAME BOY.,"with his crutches. O, what would he not give to throw them aside and"
489,THE LAME BOY.,join in the sports of childhood! What real delight would he feel in
490,THE LAME BOY.,the exercise of the powers which you possess!
491,THE LAME BOY.,

505,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
506,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
507,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Arthur and Jane had each a little garden of their own, which had been"
508,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,given to them by their kind father. He told them that they must take
509,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"care to pluck out all the weeds, and to do all they could to make the"
510,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"flowers grow. They used to save some of their money in the winter,"
511,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"and when the spring came, they spent it in buying seeds and roots."
512,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
513,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"When the little leaves and stems began to peep above ground, Arthur"
514,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"and Jane watered them every day; and as the plants grew, they took"
515,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"care to keep them free from all insects, and to shade them when the"
516,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,sun shone too strongly. They made a nice path of gravel between the
517,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"beds, which they kept quite smooth and clean. In the afternoon, as"
518,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"soon as they came home from school, they used to run into the garden"
519,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,to see to their sweet flowers. With all this care the beds looked
520,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,very pretty when summer came.
521,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
522,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,But there was one thing which gave them a good deal of trouble. Weeds
523,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"would spring up. Almost as fast as they were plucked up in one place,"
524,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,they grew in another.
525,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
526,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“I do not like those ugly, naughty weeds,” said Jane to her mother."
527,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,“They must not grow in my pretty garden. I want only sweet flowers to
528,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"be there.” “Yes,” added Arthur, “I am sure we have tried our best to"
529,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"keep them out, but they will grow in spite of us.”"
530,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
531,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“It is just like other little gardens,” said their mother, “in which"
532,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,I wish to see only flowers; but I am sorry to say I have seen many
533,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"weeds thrive there, though much labor has been given to keep them"
534,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,out.”
535,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
536,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“What little gardens are they, mother?”"
537,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
538,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“Those over which I have watched, and in which I still hope to see"
539,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"some useful and lovely plants, though I have not yet quite gained my"
540,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"wish. I have often thought I could see a few buds, but they have not"
541,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,come into full blossom. And sometimes where I had hoped to find a
542,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"flower, I have only plucked a weed.”"
543,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
544,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,“But where are these gardens?”
545,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
546,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“These gardens are your young hearts, my dears. You know I have"
547,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,wished to see there what I would call my pleasant flowers. One of
548,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,these is Kindness; and a very large and fine plant it is when fully
549,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"grown; but the weed of Selfishness too often springs up around it,"
550,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,until it is quite covered from our view. This ill weed will spread
551,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"in all directions, and twine itself about every stalk that comes in"
552,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,its way. Humility is a very pretty flower. It does not make much
553,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"show, for like the sweet violet it hides itself among its own leaves."
554,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,If you mark it well you will see its delicate and sweet-smelling
555,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"blossoms. But there are tall and showy weeds called Pride and Vanity,"
556,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"which, though they please some eyes, are very hurtful to the flowers."
557,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Truth is another plant in these gardens, but the hurtful weed of"
558,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Falsehood will come up by its side, and cause it soon to wither and"
559,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"die. Then there are other flowers, known by the names of Industry,"
560,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Contentment, and Peace, which are much admired by all who see them;"
561,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"but the naughty weeds of Idleness, Sullenness, and Anger often choke"
562,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,the nice plants before they are fully grown.”
563,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
564,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“O, I see, mother, what you mean now. The flowers are good tempers"
565,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"and conduct, and the weeds are our wicked passions and evil ways.”"
566,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
567,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“You are quite right, Arthur, and you should know that the evil"
568,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,of your hearts is friendly to the growth of these hurtful weeds.
569,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,Gardeners say that it is always needful to keep young plants clear
570,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"from all weeds, which twine round the roots, and stop their growth."
571,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"You see, then, why I have tried to root out all evil which I have"
572,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"seen in your conduct, or to cut it down; but I have felt that the"
573,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Holy Spirit must renew your hearts. We must watch, and pray, and"
574,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,labor; yet only the Spirit of God can so change these little gardens
575,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,of your hearts as to make ‘the plants of grace’ grow and flourish in
576,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,them.”
577,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
578,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“You said to us, dear mother, that if we ask God to give us his Holy"
579,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Spirit, he will hear and answer our prayer.”"
580,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,
581,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"“Yes, I did, Jane; and I hope you and your brother will not forget"
582,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,the lesson I then taught you. Then I shall see in you those flowers
583,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"which, of all others, are the most lovely that can be found in the"
584,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,human heart. There will be the precious blossom of faith; you will
585,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"look to Jesus as your Saviour, who died for you on the cross; and you"
586,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,will make him all your trust. The sweet plant of Love will flourish
587,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"too: you will yield yourselves to God, and love him because he first"
588,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,loved you. And blooming Hope will appear in all its beauty; you will
589,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,look forward to the happy time when you shall be removed from the
590,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,"Lord’s garden on earth, the church of Christ, to flourish in his"
591,FLOWERS AND WEEDS.,heavenly courts forever.”

633,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"How many living things there are in the world besides boys and girls,"

643,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,If God had not been very wise he would not have known how to make so

647,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
648,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,God has made all things just as they ought to be made. What would the
649,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,bird do with fins? he could not swim with them. What would the fish
650,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"do with wings? he could not fly with them,—he would, indeed, be “like"

652,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
653,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"If a cow had wings, what a fright she would be to look at in the air!"
654,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"I would run and hide myself; would not you? Why, if she came down,"
655,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"and fell upon us, she would crush us and kill us. There is a picture,"
656,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"in a book that I have, of a horse with wings; but that is all fancy."
657,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"A horse is very swift, but swift as he is, he does not fly. No, no!"
658,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"Let people say what they like,"

660,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,There is no such thing
661,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,As a horse with a wing.
662,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
663,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"The other day, when the sun was very bright, I saw some gnats at play"
664,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"under a tree. How they did fly up and down! Well, all at once, what"
665,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,should one of them do but settle on my nose! when I spoke to him—
666,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
667,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"“O, O! Mr. Gnat,"
668,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"Pray, what are you at?”"
669,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
670,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"Soon he flew away again, and began to play as before."

672,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,I once heard of a gnat that teased a lion half out of his senses.
673,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,What the lion had done to make him angry I do not know. No doubt you
674,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,wonder that the lion did not kill him; but he could not. The gnat
675,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"flew close to his eyes, and sat on his nose, and flew away again"
676,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,every time the lion lifted up his great paw. If the little gnat was
677,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"able to plague the great lion, let us act kindly to all, for we see"
678,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,that the weak may vex the strong. The best way is to live in love

683,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,Just as I came away from the tree an old horse went under it. Poor
684,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,thing! his hip bones stood up very high. I could almost count the
685,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,number of his ribs; and one of his legs a little above the hoof was a
686,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,great deal bigger than it ought to have been.
687,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
688,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,In less than a minute all the gnats were flying about the old horse.
689,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"He laid down his ears, and shook his head, and then he lifted up one"
690,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,of his feet and struck his iron hoof on the ground. He did not like
691,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"the gnats to be about his eyes and ears, any more than I did to have"
692,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,one on my nose. At last the old horse walked away; some of the gnats

700,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"him with my eyes, he flies so fast. There! what a bang he gave the"

702,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,fly faster than a horse can gallop.
703,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
704,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"An odd tale has been told, which I will tell you. A bear and a man"
705,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,once acted kindly one to the other. The man fell asleep on the
706,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"ground, but he had not much rest, for a fly would settle on his face."
707,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
708,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"“O,” thought the bear, “I will do a kind deed for my friend. I will"
709,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"kill the fly that teases him.” With this, he lifted up his great,"
710,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,"heavy paw; but, alas! in killing the fly he tore with his claws the"
711,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,face of the man also.
712,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,
713,THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS.,Let us learn a lesson from this tale. Let us take care that every
