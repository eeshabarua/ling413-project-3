411,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
412,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
413,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"I must ask you to go back more than two hundred years, and watch two"
414,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,people in a quiet old English garden.
415,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
416,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,One is an old lady reading. In her young days she was a famous beauty.
417,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"That was very long ago, to be sure; but I think she is a beauty"
418,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,still--do not you?
419,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
420,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"She has such a lovely face, and her eyes are so sweet and bright! and"
421,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"better than that, they are the kind which see pleasant things in"
422,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"everybody, and something to like and be interested in. I hope with all"
423,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"my heart yours are that kind, too."
424,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
425,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The other person is a little child. She was christened Mary Brenton,"
426,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"like her grandmother; but she was called Polly all her days, for"
427,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,short; and we will call her so.
428,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
429,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"She is sitting on the grass with a little cat in her arms, which she"
430,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,is trying to put to sleep. But the kitten is not so accommodating as
431,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"a doll would be, and just as Polly does not dare to move for fear of"
432,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"waking her, she makes up her mind that a run after a leaf and a play"
433,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,with any chance caterpillar which may be so unlucky as to cross her
434,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"path, will be very preferable, and tries to get away."
435,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
436,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"It is one of the most delightful days that ever was. September, and"
437,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"almost too warm, if it were not for the breeze that brings cooler air"
438,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,from the sea. Once in a while some fruit falls from the heavily-laden
439,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"trees, and the first dead leaves rustle a little on the ground. The"
440,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"bees are busy, making the most of the bright day; for they know of the"
441,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"stormy weather coming. The sky is very blue, and the flowers very"
442,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"bright. Two swallows are playing hide-and-seek through the orchard,"
443,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and chasing each other in great races, now so close to the ground that"
444,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"it seems as if their feet might catch in the green grass, and now away"
445,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,up in the air over the high walls out towards the hills; and just as
446,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"one loses sight of them, and turns away, here they are again. And in"
447,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,the kitchen the girls are clattering the dishes and laughing; and do
448,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"you hear some one singing a doleful tune in a cheery, happy voice?"
449,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
450,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"That is Dorothy, Polly's dear Dorothy, who waits upon grandmother,"
451,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"with whom she has been to France, and Holland, and Scotland, and who"
452,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,can tell almost as charming stories as grandmother herself.
453,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
454,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The house is large and old, with queer-shaped windows, all sizes and"
455,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"all heights from the ground, and a great many of them hidden by the"
456,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"ivy. That is the outside; and if you were to go in, you would find"
457,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"large, low rooms, filled with furniture that you would think queer and"
458,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"uncomfortable. And there are portraits in some of them, one of Polly,"
459,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"probably painted not very long before, in which she is attired after"
460,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the fashion of those days, and looks nearly as old as she would now"
461,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,if she were living!
462,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
463,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Now let us go back to the garden. The kitten has escaped, and Polly is"
464,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,wishing for something to do.
465,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
466,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""Where's Dolly?"" says grandmother. ""Find her, and then gather some"
467,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"apples and plums, and have a tea drinking."""
468,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
469,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,The doll had been very ill all day; it was strange in grandmother to
470,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"forget it. She had fallen asleep just before dinner, and been put"
471,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,carefully in her bed; it would never do to wake her so soon. And
472,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"besides, a tea party was not amusing when there was no one to sit at"
473,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the other end of the table. This referred to Tom, Polly's dearest"
474,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"cousin, who had just left her after a long visit; and she missed him"
475,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,sadly.
476,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
477,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""And,"" says Polly, ""I do not think I should care for it if he were"
478,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"here, if I could have nothing but apples. I'm tired of them. I have"
479,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"eaten one of every kind in the garden to-day, even the great yellow"
480,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,ones by the lower gate. I think they're disagreeable; but I left them
481,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"till the very last, and then I was afraid they would feel sorry to be"
482,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"left out. I think I will eat another, though; and I will not have a"
483,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"party--it's a trouble. Which kind would you take, grandmother?"""
484,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
485,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""One of the very smallest,"" says the old lady, laughing; ""but stop a"
486,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"moment. I have one I'll give you;"" and she took a beauty from her"
487,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"pocket, and threw it on the grass by Polly."
488,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
489,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""That's the very prettiest apple I ever saw,"" says the child. ""Where"
490,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,did you get it? Not off our trees. 'Father gave it to you?' and where
491,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"did he find it?"""
492,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
493,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,Grandmother did not know.

495,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,[Illustration: LITTLE POLLY.]
496,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
497,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"After admiring her apple a little more, Polly eats it in a most"
498,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"deliberate manner, enjoying every bite as if it were the first she had"
499,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"eaten that day, and when she has finished it, gives a contented little"
500,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"sigh, and sits looking at the fine brown seeds which she holds in"
501,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"her hand. Presently she says, earnestly,--"

508,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and I would put them in the doll's chest until to-morrow; I wouldn't
509,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"eat them to-day, you know."""
510,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
511,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""I will tell you what you can do,"" says grandmother. ""Are those seeds"
512,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"in your hand? Go find Dorothy, and ask her to give you the empty"
513,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,flower-pot from the high shelf at my window; and then you can fill it
514,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"with dark earth from one of the flower-beds, and plant them; then by"
515,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and by you will have a tree, and can have plenty of your apple's"
516,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"children."""
517,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
518,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,That was a happy thought. And Polly puts the seeds carefully on a
519,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"leaf, and runs to find Dorothy. Now she comes back with a queer little"
520,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Dutch china flower-pot, and sits down on the grass again, and makes a"
521,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"hole in the soft brown earth with her finger, and drops the fine seeds"
522,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,in.
523,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
524,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"For days she watered them, and carried them to sunny places; but at"
525,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"last she grew very impatient, and one morning, when she was all alone"
526,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"in the garden, very much provoked that they had not made their"
527,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"appearance, took a twig and explored; and the first poke brought to"
528,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"light the little seeds, as shiny and brown as when they left the"
529,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"apple. It was a great disappointment, and Polly caught them up, and"
530,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"threw them as far away as she could, and with tears in her eyes ran in"
531,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,to tell grandmother.
532,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
533,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""Ah,"" said the dear old lady, ""it was not time! Thou hast not learned"
534,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"thy lesson of waiting; and no wonder, when there are few so hard, and"
535,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"thou art still so young."""
536,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
537,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Then she sent Polly back to the garden, and the pot was put in its"
538,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"place, again. And a week or two after, as grandmother was just going"
539,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"to make room in the earth for a new plant, she saw growing there a"
540,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"little green sprig, which was not a weed. She listened a moment, and"
541,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,heard the child's voice outside.
542,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
543,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""Polly, my dear, are you sure you scattered all the seeds of your"
544,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,pretty apple the day you were so provoked at their not having begun to
545,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"grow for you?"""
546,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
547,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The child reddened a little, and turned away."
548,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
549,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""I don't know, grandmother. I think so; I wished to then."""
550,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
551,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"How delighted she was when the old lady showed her the treasure, and"
552,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,how carefully it was watched and tended! For one little seed had been
553,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"buried deeper than the rest, and now in the sunshine of grandmother's"
554,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,wide window it had come up. Every pleasant day it was placed somewhere
555,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"in the sun, and at night it was always carried to Polly's own room."
556,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Her dolls and other old play-house friends, formerly much honored, and"
557,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"of great consequence, were quite neglected for ""the apple tree,"" as"
558,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,she always called the tiny thing with its few bits of leaves.
559,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
560,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,And now we must leave the Brentons' old stone house and the garden.
561,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"All this happened in the days of King Charles I., when there was a"
562,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"great war, and the country in a highly discordant state. Polly's"
563,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"father was on the king's side, and one day he did something which was"
564,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"considered particularly unpardonable by his enemies, and at night he"
565,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,came riding from Oxford in the greatest hurry he had ever been in; and
566,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"riding after him were some of Cromwell's men. It was bright moonlight,"
567,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and as he rode in the paved yard the great dogs in their kennels began
568,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"to bark, and that waked Polly's mother, in a terrible fright at"
569,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"hearing her husband's voice, and sure something undesirable had"
570,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,happened.
571,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
572,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Squire Brenton hurried in to tell her, in as few words as possible,"
573,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"what he had done, and that he was followed, and had just time to say"
574,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"good by, and take another horse, and rush on to the sea, where he"
575,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"hoped to find a fishing-boat, by means of which he could escape."
576,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
577,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""And you,"" said he, ""had better take Polly and one of the men, and"
578,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"ride to your cousin Matthew's; for in their rage at my escape, they"
579,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"may mean to burn my house. I little thought a month ago,--when he"
580,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"offered you 'a safe home,' and I laughed in his face, and said, 'Give"
581,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,your good wife the same message; for she may not find your house so
582,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"safe as mine by and by,'--that you would need to accept so soon."""
583,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
584,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""But I cannot go there now,"" said Mistress Brenton; ""for cousin"
585,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Matthew is away with the Roundhead army, and his wife and sister have"
586,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,gone to the north. I'll go with you. Listen: I heard one of the maids
587,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,say to-day that a ship sails to-morrow at daybreak from the bay by
588,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Dunner's with a company of Puritans for Holland, on their way to one"
589,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,of the American colonies. We will go for a time to our friends in
590,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Amsterdam, and be quite safe."""
591,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
592,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Anything was better than staying where he was; and Squire Brenton,"
593,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"bidding her hurry, went to the stables with his tired horse, and"
594,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"waking one of his men whom he could trust, told him why he was there,"
595,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and to say, when the men came, that he was in Oxford yesterday, when"
596,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"they had a letter, and that Mistress Brenton had gone north to some"
597,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"friends. He gave him some messages for his brother, and then, sending"
598,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"him out to a field with the horse he had been riding, which would"
599,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"certainly have betrayed him, he went back to the yard, trying to keep"
600,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the two fresh horses still, while he listened, fearing every moment to"
601,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,hear his pursuers coming down the road.
602,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
603,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Presently out came Mistress Brenton, carrying some bundles of"
604,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"clothing, and a few little things besides, and wrapped in a great"
605,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"riding cloak; and at her side walked Polly, very sleepy, and looking"
606,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"wonderingly in the faces of the others, and asking all manner of"
607,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,childish questions.
608,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
609,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Suddenly she ran back to the house, just as her father was going to"
610,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"lift her on his horse; and when she came back, what do you think she"
611,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"had? Together in a little bag were her doll and kitten, and one arm"
612,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"held tightly her little apple tree, wrapped in some garment of her own"
613,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,which she had found lying near it.
614,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
615,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"And then they rode away. The poor child, after begging them to go to"
616,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"her uncle's, so she might say good by to grandmother, fell asleep,"
617,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,holding fast her treasures all the while.
618,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
619,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,There was a faint glimmer of light over the sea as they neared the
620,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"shore, and they saw anchored at a little distance a small ship, and"
621,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,could see the men moving about her deck; for the wind had risen. Mr.
622,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Brenton found a man whom he knew, in whose charge he left the horses,"
623,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and then a fisherman rowed them to the vessel.
624,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
625,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The captain was nowhere to be seen, and the sailors paid no attention"
626,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,to them as they came on deck in the chilly morning twilight; and they
627,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"went immediately below, and hid themselves in a dark corner, thinking"
628,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"they might have to go ashore if discovered, and that it was best to"
629,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,keep out of sight until it was too late to turn back. In the darkness
630,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,they fell asleep. This may seem very strange; but remembering the long
631,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"ride, and the fright they had been in, and that now they felt safe, we"
632,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"can hardly wonder. At any rate, it was the middle of the afternoon"
633,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,before Colonel Brenton--I think I have never given him his title
634,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"before--made his appearance on deck, to the great astonishment of the"
635,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"captain and all the other people, who knew him more or less. He told"
636,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the captain what had happened, saying at the end he would pay him"
637,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"double the usual passage money to Holland, where he meant to stay for"
638,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,a while; and at this the rough man really turned pale.
639,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
640,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""Holland, _Holland_!"" said he; ""do you not see we're going down the"
641,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Channel? We are bound direct for America."""
642,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
643,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The story says that Colonel Brenton was almost beside himself, and"
644,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"offered large sums of money to be taken back, or to France; but the"
645,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"captain would not consent, saying that they had made good progress,"
646,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and it was late in the year. The ship would come back in the spring,"
647,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and he must content himself.
648,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
649,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,Those of the ship's company who knew our friends had great wonderings
650,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"at their having turned Puritans, until they knew the true state of"
651,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"affairs. Must not it have been dreadful news to Mistress Brenton, and"
652,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,was it not really a dreary prospect--a dreary journey in that frail
653,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"ship, and at the end a cold, forlorn country? and all the stories of"
654,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,the Indians' cruelties to the settlers came to her mind. They could
655,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"not, in all probability, return for many months. No one whom she cared"
656,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,particularly for would be there to welcome them. Polly did not take it
657,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"very much to heart, though she cried a little because she was not to"
658,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"go to Holland, which she had heard so much of from her grandmother and"
659,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,Dorothy. It was a great many days before they gave up their hope of
660,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,falling in with some vessel to which they might be transferred; and
661,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the first two weeks were sunshiny and pleasant, with a good wind. But"
662,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"soon it grew bleaker and colder, and they suffered greatly. All"
663,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"through the pleasant days, Polly had been having a very enjoyable"
664,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"time. There were several children on board, and they had games around"
665,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,the deck and in the cabin.
666,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
667,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"It was delightful to have the kitten, who had a cord tied around her"
668,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"neck; and when she was not in Polly's arms, she was generally anchored"
669,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,for safety in the cabin. Every day she had part of her little
670,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"mistress's dinner; and though she missed the garden, and the dead"
671,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"leaves that nestled about the walks, and made such nice playthings,"
672,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and the sedate old family cat, her mother, and her mother's numerous"
673,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"poor relations who lived in the stables, she was by no means unhappy."
674,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"And the doll's expression was as complacent as ever, though she had"
675,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,worn one gown an astonishing length of time. But if you could have
676,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,seen the care the little tree received! It was carefully wrapped in
677,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the same little cloak Polly put round it the night they left home, and"
678,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,only on the warmest days it was taken on deck to have the sunshine;
679,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and every day it had part of Polly's small allowance of water; and
680,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"when the kitten had had its share, there would often be very little"
681,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,left.
682,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
683,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The weary days went slowly by. The ship was slow at the best, and the"
684,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"winds were contrary. The provisions grew less and less, and the water"
685,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"was almost exhausted. Two people--a man, and a child Polly had grown"
686,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"very fond of--died, and were buried in the sea. The sky was cold and"
687,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"gray, and it snowed and rained, and every one looked sad and"
688,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,disheartened. It was terribly desolate. Polly could not often go on
689,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"deck, for the frozen spray and rain made it very slippery and"
690,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"dangerous there; and her mother told story after story, and did her"
691,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,best to shorten the longest December days she had ever known. And soon
692,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"there came a terrible bereavement. One night there was a great storm,"
693,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and the dearly-beloved kitten, frightened to death by the things"
694,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"rolling about, and the pitching of the ship, broke the cord and rushed"
695,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"out in the darkness, and never was seen any more. I think a little cat"
696,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"has never been so mourned since the world began. That night, the Dutch"
697,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"flower-pot, with its leafless twig, went rolling about the cabin"
698,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"floor, and half the earth was scattered in the folds of its"
699,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"wrappings, and carefully replaced next morning."
700,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
701,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"But at last the voyage was ended; they saw land, and finally came"
702,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"close to it and went ashore, Polly with her dear doll and something"
703,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,else rolled up in a little gray cloak. The ship was to stay until
704,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,spring; and there seemed no hope of getting back to England until
705,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,then. It was hard to decide what to do; but at last Colonel Brenton
706,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"heard of some men whom he had known, who had been made prisoners in"
707,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,some of the battles in the north of England and sent to the
708,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Massachusetts colony by Cromwell, who had feared to imprison them."
709,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,They had been sent to the settlement in York.
710,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
711,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"So the Brentons joined a party going there, or to places beyond. It"
712,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"was the last of January that they came to York, and were warmly"
713,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"welcomed at the great garrison, where they lived till spring. Polly"
714,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"found a very nice child to play with. There had been a good harvest,"
715,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and the Indians were uncommonly peaceable. They had great log fires in
716,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the wide fireplace in the east room; and for a winter in those times,"
717,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,it was very comfortable. The flower-pot was deposited in a chink of
718,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,the great chimney. Polly had insisted upon bringing it with her; and
719,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"though ""the tree"" at that time was a slender little straight stick,"
720,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,she had firm faith that spring time would give it leaves again. And
721,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"strange to say, she was not disappointed; for all the exposure had not"
722,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"destroyed it. The first of June came, and they were still living in"
723,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the garrison-house, looking every day for a messenger to tell them the"
724,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,ship was ready to go back. Some people on their way to one of the
725,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"eastern settlements, early in April, had told them there were no signs"
726,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,of her sailing; and since then they had heard nothing. How dismayed
727,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"they were, early in June, to find the ship had sailed nearly two"
728,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,months before! It seemed as if everything was against them; and they
729,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,could live no longer in the garrison. So the Brentons had a little log
730,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"house near by, and ""the squire"" worked every day in the great field"
731,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,down towards the river. It must have been such a strange life for
732,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,them! and I suppose their thoughts often went back to the dear English
733,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,home. When Mistress Brenton looked from the small window in her log
734,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"house out over half-cleared fields, and saw the garrison-house, and"
735,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"her husband working among the hills of corn with his gun close by,"
736,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"every now and then looking anxiously about him, she would remember the"
737,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"wide window, with its cushioned seat, in her own room at home, and the"
738,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"sunny garden, with the flowers and bees, and the maids and men singing"
739,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and chattering in the distance, and the dear voice of grandmother"
740,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,singing the old church hymns. It was a great change; but days much
741,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,more forlorn than these were yet to come.
742,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
743,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The Indians came around the settlement in large numbers, and no one"
744,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,dared to be out alone. At night the people waked in fear at the
745,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,slightest noise; and in the daytime it was after the same fashion.
746,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"News came of whole settlements having been murdered or made captives,"
747,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and some of their own neighbors disappeared finally; and then the
748,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"suspense was terrible. At last, one day Mrs. Brenton had gone up to"
749,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the garrison to see one of the women, who was ill, and most of the men"
750,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,were in the field. Polly went with her mother; but the women were
751,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"talking over something about the king and Parliament, which she found"
752,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"very uninteresting, and soon she unfastened the great outer door, and"
753,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"unwisely ran out with her doll in her arms, and went down to the field"
754,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"to see the men at work. But on her way, she bethought herself of a"
755,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"charming stump she had seen out at one side of the path, and went to"
756,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,visit it. None of the men happened to see her. She talked to the
757,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"doll, and made a throne for her of the soft moss growing around her,"
758,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and had been playing there some time, when suddenly she heard shouts,"
759,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and thought they must be killing a snake, and looked up to see all the"
760,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"men running up the hill to the garrison, with a great many Indians"
761,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"chasing them; and she heard a gun fired, and saw one of the men who"
762,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"had petted and been very kind to her, and told her stories, fall to"
763,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the ground. Ah, how frightened she was!"
764,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
765,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"The doll was snatched from her throne, and the poor little girl ran"
766,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"towards the garrison, too, right towards the Indians. It was weary"
767,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"work running over the rough ground,--and the tall grass was not much"
768,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"better,--and then on, up the hill. By this time the men had succeeded"
769,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"in getting in; and the wicked-looking Indians, after a yell of"
770,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"disappointment, turned to go back to the one who lay dead on the"
771,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"hill-side, and to escape the bullets which would come in a moment from"
772,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the loopholes. O, if she could only get by them!"
773,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
774,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,Up the hill she hurried as fast as the poor tired little feet could
775,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"carry her, hugging the doll, almost breathless, with the great tears"
776,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"falling very fast, and still crying, ""Wait, father!"""
777,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
778,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,I am glad I know one kind thing the Indians of those days did. As they
779,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"turned, they saw her coming, and some hurried forward a little to"
780,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"seize her; and it would have been so easy. But one spoke, and they all"
781,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"stopped, and laughed, and shouted, and the child got safely in."
782,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
783,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"Then the Indians went to the Brentons' house, and some others, and"
784,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"burned them; but luckily the apple tree was at the play-house, by a"
785,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"large rock, at a little distance, and the wind was not in that"
786,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"direction; and after they disappeared, it was brought up to the fort,"
787,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,safe and sound.
788,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
789,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"It soon grew tall and strong, and in a little while was entirely too"
790,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,large for its pot; and finally Polly was forced to put it in the
791,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"ground. It was hard to do it; for she had cared for it, and loved it"
792,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"so long, and this was giving it up, in a measure. And I think if she"
793,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"had understood that now it must be left behind, it would have been"
794,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,almost impossible to have persuaded her. Her father comforted her by
795,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,telling her he could get quantities of the apples not very far from
796,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"home, and she could plant more seeds as soon as she liked, or, far"
797,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"better than that, he would graft a tree."
798,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
799,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"In September, news came that a ship was going to the east coast of"
800,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"England; and they were all heartily glad, in spite of the long,"
801,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"dangerous voyage; and leaving the York friends, who had been so kind,"
802,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and whom they would probably never see any more, Polly gave the little"
803,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"tree to a Masterson child, her great friend, who promised to wrap it"
804,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"in straw for winter, and to be very kind to it and fond of it. And I"
805,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,think she must have been faithful to her charge. Mistress Brenton laid
806,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,some of the leaves in the little book she had had in her pocket that
807,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"night, almost a year ago, when they left home. So they went to Boston,"
808,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and sailed for the old country.
809,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
810,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,I know nothing more of them; but we will hope their voyage was a short
811,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"and easy one, and that they reached home on a pleasant, sunny day, and"
812,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"grandmother was there, and Dorothy, and all the people, and Polly had"
813,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"stories to tell as wonderful as Dorothy's, and all true, and that they"
814,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,were all happy forever after.
815,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
816,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"A while ago I stood on the hill with an old farmer, eating one of a"
817,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"pocketful of apples he had given me, and said how very nice it was,"
818,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,and that I had never seen any like it.
819,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
820,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""There are none of my apples sell half so well,"" said he. ""I've forty"
821,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,young trees that have been bearing a few years; and over to the right
822,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,you see some old ones. Mine were grafted from those and my father
823,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"took his grafts from an old tree I'd like to show you;"" and as we"
824,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"walked towards it, he said, ""It looks, and I guess it is, as old as"
825,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,any around here. My father always said it was brought from England in
826,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,a flower-pot by some of the first settlers. Perhaps you have heard the
827,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,story. It's very shaky. The high winds last fall were pretty hard on
828,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"it. It will never bear again, I am afraid. I set a good deal by the"
829,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,old thing. The very first thing I can remember is my father's lifting
830,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"me up to one of the lower limbs, and I was frightened and cried. I"
831,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,believe I think more of that tree than of anything on my farm. My wife
832,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"always laughs at me about it. Well, it has lasted my time. I'm old and"
833,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"shaky, too; and I suppose my sons won't miss this much, and will like"
834,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"the young orchard best."""
835,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,
836,THE ORCHARD'S GRANDMOTHER.,"""And you and I like your orchard's grandmother,"" said I."

846,ROUGH.,"He was a donkey, and we called him Rough. He belonged to Gerald and"
847,ROUGH.,"me. We didn't keep him for his useful qualities, and we certainly"
848,ROUGH.,didn't keep him for his moral qualities; and I don't know what we did
849,ROUGH.,"keep him for, unless, for the best reason in the world, that we loved"
850,ROUGH.,him.
851,ROUGH.,
852,ROUGH.,"He was always getting us into scrapes, the most renowned of which was"
853,ROUGH.,one Rough's enemies were fond of alluding to.
854,ROUGH.,
855,ROUGH.,We were bidden to a christening one fair spring morning; and we not
856,ROUGH.,"only accepted the invitation, but promised to bring apple-blossoms, to"
857,ROUGH.,fill the font and make the church look gay. We had an old apple
858,ROUGH.,"orchard, that bore beautiful blossoms, but worthless fruit; and of"
859,ROUGH.,these blossoms we had leave to pick as many as we chose.
860,ROUGH.,
861,ROUGH.,"So we filled the donkey-cart with them, and set forth for the"
862,ROUGH.,"christening, which was to be at a little church about a mile or more"
863,ROUGH.,distant from our farm. Rough's enemies will tell how we arrived when
864,ROUGH.,"the christening was all over, and our apple blossoms faded."
865,ROUGH.,
866,ROUGH.,We were never so happy as when we had a whole leisure afternoon to go
867,ROUGH.,"off with Rough in the donkey-cart, and our little sister Daisy by"
868,ROUGH.,"Gerald's side, on the board that served as seat, and I lying on my"
869,ROUGH.,"back on the bottom of the cart, with my heels dangling out of it. So I"
870,ROUGH.,"would lie for hours, whistling and looking up at the drifting clouds,"
871,ROUGH.,or with my hat over my eyes to keep out the sun.
872,ROUGH.,
873,ROUGH.,"One afternoon, early in March, when the roads were almost knee deep in"
874,ROUGH.,"mud, and the last of the melting snow made a running stream on either"
875,ROUGH.,"side of the road, we were slowly travelling along after the manner I"
876,ROUGH.,have described. We were going to take a longing look at the skating
877,ROUGH.,"pond, two miles from our farm. We were forbidden to try the dangerous"
878,ROUGH.,"ice, but meant only to look upon the scene of our winter's delight."
879,ROUGH.,
880,ROUGH.,"""Some one's in the pond!"" cried Daisy."
881,ROUGH.,
882,ROUGH.,"""How do ye know?"" said I, not removing my hat from my face."
883,ROUGH.,
884,ROUGH.,"You see Daisy was only six years old, and I hadn't much faith in her"
885,ROUGH.,observation.
886,ROUGH.,
887,ROUGH.,"""Cos I sees 'em with my own eyes."""
888,ROUGH.,
889,ROUGH.,I jumped up and looked. It was only a hat I saw. Gerald meanwhile
890,ROUGH.,"said nothing, but had pulled up Rough (who not only stopped, but lay"
891,ROUGH.,"down in the mud), and looked. I watched him, to see what he thought,"
892,ROUGH.,or proposed to do.
893,ROUGH.,
894,ROUGH.,[Illustration: {A child collecting flowers together}]
895,ROUGH.,
896,ROUGH.,People had a way of trusting to Gerald's judgment rather than their
897,ROUGH.,"own, and were generally better off for it."
898,ROUGH.,
899,ROUGH.,"""It _is_ some one in the pond,"" said Gerald; and then followed a short"
900,ROUGH.,discussion as to whether we should leave Daisy alone to the mercies of
901,ROUGH.,"Rough, which resulted in our leaving Rough, and taking Daisy along"
902,ROUGH.,with us down to the pond.
903,ROUGH.,
904,ROUGH.,"We could see a boy, apparently about Gerald's age, swimming and"
905,ROUGH.,"striving to keep up, and catching at the ice, which broke as he clung"
906,ROUGH.,"to it. He swam feebly, as if benumbed and wearied."
907,ROUGH.,
908,ROUGH.,"""Keep a brave heart!"" roared Gerald; ""we'll save you!"" and then began"
909,ROUGH.,"to take off his boots and coat. The boy sank--under the ice, this"
910,ROUGH.,time. We could see it bobbing up and down as he swam beneath it.
911,ROUGH.,
912,ROUGH.,"""Stay here till I call you,"" said Gerald to me, as he stepped from the"
913,ROUGH.,"shore on to the ice, and walked out towards where the swimmer was"
914,ROUGH.,"hidden by the ice. I stood breathless, with my eye on Gerald."
915,ROUGH.,
916,ROUGH.,"The ice began to crack under him. He lay down on his stomach, and"
917,ROUGH.,pulled himself forward with his hands. Up came the swimmer not far
918,ROUGH.,from him.
919,ROUGH.,
920,ROUGH.,"""Keep up! Gerald will save you!"" cried Daisy."
921,ROUGH.,
922,ROUGH.,"The poor fellow cast one despairing look at Gerald, and sank again."
923,ROUGH.,Gerald had gone as far as was practicable on the ice. I could hear it
924,ROUGH.,"cracking all over, and see the white cracks darting suddenly over ice"
925,ROUGH.,that had looked safe.
926,ROUGH.,
927,ROUGH.,Up came the boy again.
928,ROUGH.,
929,ROUGH.,"""Keep up! keep up!"" cried Daisy, in an excited treble. ""Gerald will"
930,ROUGH.,"save you!"""
931,ROUGH.,
932,ROUGH.,"But the boy could hear nothing. He had his eyes closed, and seemed to"
933,ROUGH.,"have fainted. Gerald reached out, and clutched him by the arm. How the"
934,ROUGH.,ice cracked all about him! My heart was in my mouth; I thought he was
935,ROUGH.,in. I began to take my coat off.
936,ROUGH.,
937,ROUGH.,"""A scarf!"" said Gerald, speaking for the first time."
938,ROUGH.,
939,ROUGH.,"I took off my own, and picked up Gerald's from the ground, and tied"
940,ROUGH.,them firmly together. I saw that they were too short. Daisy offered
941,ROUGH.,"hers. I took it, with an inward fear, if the child should catch cold;"
942,ROUGH.,it seemed paltry to think of it at such a moment. I stepped out on the
943,ROUGH.,"ice, and went a few steps, when Gerald cried,--"
944,ROUGH.,
945,ROUGH.,"""Stop!"""
946,ROUGH.,
947,ROUGH.,I obeyed like a soldier.
948,ROUGH.,
949,ROUGH.,"""Throw it now!"""
950,ROUGH.,
951,ROUGH.,"I threw the long string of scarfs. Gerald dexterously caught it, and"
952,ROUGH.,"upholding the poor boy with one hand, with the other passed the string"
953,ROUGH.,"under his arms, and tied the ends of it to his own arm. Then he paused"
954,ROUGH.,"a moment before attempting the hazardous work of coming ashore, and"
955,ROUGH.,looked at me speculatively. I knew what he meant. There was a shadow
956,ROUGH.,of trouble in his face that had nothing to do with his own danger. He
957,ROUGH.,"was weighing the possibility of his falling in, and my doing the same"
958,ROUGH.,"in trying to save him, and Daisy alone on the shore. I gave a cheering"
959,ROUGH.,"""Go ahead, old fellow!"" and he began to push himself back again,"
960,ROUGH.,dragging his senseless burden after him by the scarf tied to his arm.
961,ROUGH.,
962,ROUGH.,"Crack! crack! crack! went the ice all about him, and little tides of"
963,ROUGH.,water flooded it. At last it seemed a little firmer. Gerald rose to
964,ROUGH.,"his feet, and dragging the boy still in the water after him, began to"
965,ROUGH.,"walk slowly towards the shore, not seeming to notice how the sharp"
966,ROUGH.,edges of the ice cut the face and forehead of the poor half-drowned
967,ROUGH.,boy.
968,ROUGH.,
969,ROUGH.,Again the ice began to crack and undulate. Gerald stood still for a
970,ROUGH.,"moment, and the piece on which he stood broke away from the rest, and"
971,ROUGH.,"began to float out. He jumped to the next, which broke, and so to the"
972,ROUGH.,"next, and the next, till he neared the shore. Then he paused a moment,"
973,ROUGH.,and looked at me.
974,ROUGH.,
975,ROUGH.,"""Go ashore!"" he roared like a sea captain."
976,ROUGH.,
977,ROUGH.,"Then I noticed that I stood on a detached piece of ice, but nearer"
978,ROUGH.,land than Gerald. I found no difficulty in gaining the shore.
979,ROUGH.,
980,ROUGH.,"""Now stand firm and give a hand!"" said Gerald."
981,ROUGH.,
982,ROUGH.,"I grasped his hand, and he jumped ashore, and together we lifted the"
983,ROUGH.,"boy out of the water. Daisy burst into tears, crying,--"
984,ROUGH.,
985,ROUGH.,"""O, Gerald, Gerald, I thought you'd be drowned!"""
986,ROUGH.,
987,ROUGH.,"Gerald very gently put her clinging arms away from him, saying,"
988,ROUGH.,"firmly,--"
989,ROUGH.,
990,ROUGH.,"""Don't cry, Daisy. We have our hands full with this poor fellow."""
991,ROUGH.,
992,ROUGH.,"I got the skates off the ""poor fellow,"" and gave them to Daisy to"
993,ROUGH.,"hold. She, brave little woman, gulped down her tears, and only gave"
994,ROUGH.,"vent to her emotion, now and then, by a little suppressed sob. Gerald"
995,ROUGH.,began beating the hands and breathing into the mouth and nostrils of
996,ROUGH.,the seeming lifeless form before us.
997,ROUGH.,
998,ROUGH.,"""Is he dead, Gery?"" said I."
999,ROUGH.,
1000,ROUGH.,"""No!"" said Gerald, fiercely. It was evident that he wouldn't believe"
1001,ROUGH.,"he had gone through so much trouble to bring a dead man ashore. ""Look"
1002,ROUGH.,"for his handkerchief, and see if there's a mark on it."""
1003,ROUGH.,
1004,ROUGH.,"I fished a wet rag out of the wet trousers pocket, and found in one"
1005,ROUGH.,"corner of it the name ""Stevens."""
1006,ROUGH.,
1007,ROUGH.,"""There's a farmer of that name two miles farther on. I don't know any"
1008,ROUGH.,"one else of that name. Must be his son. We'll take him home;"" and he"
1009,ROUGH.,began wrapping his coat about the poor boy; but I insisted on mine
1010,ROUGH.,"being used for the purpose, as Gerald was half wet, and his teeth were"
1011,ROUGH.,"already chattering. ""We must get him off this wet ground as soon as"
1012,ROUGH.,"possible,"" said Gerald; and together we lifted him, and slowly and"
1013,ROUGH.,laboriously bore him to the donkey-cart in the road.
1014,ROUGH.,
1015,ROUGH.,"By this time Gerald had only strength enough to hold the reins, and we"
1016,ROUGH.,"set out forthwith for the Stevens farm, I, with what help Daisy could"
1017,ROUGH.,"give, trying to bring some show of life back to the stranger. Perhaps"
1018,ROUGH.,"the jolting of the cart helped,--I don't know,--but by and by he began"
1019,ROUGH.,"to revive, and at last we propped him up in one corner of the cart,"
1020,ROUGH.,with his head supported by Daisy's knee.
1021,ROUGH.,
1022,ROUGH.,"I shall not soon forget how long the road seemed, and how I got out"
1023,ROUGH.,"and walked in deep mud, and how, when poor Rough seemed straining"
1024,ROUGH.,"every muscle to make the little cart move at all, Gerald insisted on"
1025,ROUGH.,"getting out, too, and leading Rough; how the sun set as we were wading"
1026,ROUGH.,"through a long road, where willow trees grew thick on either side, and"
1027,ROUGH.,"Daisy said, ""See; all the little pussies are out!"" how, at last, we"
1028,ROUGH.,"reached the Stevens farm, and restored the half-drowned boy to his"
1029,ROUGH.,"parents. I remember, too, how they were so utterly absorbed, very"
1030,ROUGH.,"naturally, in the welfare of their boy, as to forget all about us, and"
1031,ROUGH.,offer us no quicker means of return home than our donkey-cart.
1032,ROUGH.,
1033,ROUGH.,"They came to call on us the next day, and to thank us, and specially"
1034,ROUGH.,"Gerald, with tears of gratitude. And Gerald was a hero in the village"
1035,ROUGH.,from that day forth.
1036,ROUGH.,
1037,ROUGH.,I remember well how dark it grew as we waded slowly and silently
1038,ROUGH.,"home, and how poor little Rough did his very best, and never stopped"
1039,ROUGH.,once.
1040,ROUGH.,
1041,ROUGH.,I think he understood the importance of the occasion; but those who
1042,ROUGH.,"were not Rough's friends, believe it was a recollection, and"
1043,ROUGH.,"expectation of supper, that made him acquit himself so honorably."
1044,ROUGH.,
1045,ROUGH.,"As we neared our home, we saw a tall figure looming up in the dark,"
1046,ROUGH.,"and soon, by the voice, we knew it was Michael, one of the farm hands,"
1047,ROUGH.,sent to seek us.
1048,ROUGH.,
1049,ROUGH.,"""Bluder an nouns,"" he exclaimed, ""it is you, Mister Gery! An' yer"
1050,ROUGH.,"muther, poor leddy, destroyed wid the fright. An' kapin' the chilt out"
1051,ROUGH.,"to this hair. Hadn't ye moor sense?"""
1052,ROUGH.,
1053,ROUGH.,"We explained briefly; and Daisy begged to be carried, as the cart was"
1054,ROUGH.,all wet.
1055,ROUGH.,
1056,ROUGH.,"With many Irish expressions of sympathy, Michael took the child in his"
1057,ROUGH.,"arms; and so we arrived at home, and found father and mother half"
1058,ROUGH.,"distracted with anxiety, and the farm hands sent in all directions to"
1059,ROUGH.,"look for us. We were at once, all three of us, put to bed, and made to"
1060,ROUGH.,"drink hot lemonade, and have hot stones at our feet, and not till then"
1061,ROUGH.,"tell all our experiences, which were listened to eagerly."
1062,ROUGH.,
1063,ROUGH.,"Daisy escaped unhurt, I with a slight cold, but Gerald and poor little"
1064,ROUGH.,Rough were the ones who suffered. Gerald had a severe attack of
1065,ROUGH.,"pneumonia, from which we had much ado to bring him back to health, and"
1066,ROUGH.,Rough was ill. They brought us the news from the stable on the next
1067,ROUGH.,morning. We couldn't tell what was the matter; perhaps he had strained
1068,ROUGH.,"himself, perhaps had caught cold. We could not tell, nor could the"
1069,ROUGH.,veterinary surgeon we brought to see him. Poor Rough lay ill for
1070,ROUGH.,"weeks, and one bright spring morning he died."
1071,ROUGH.,
1072,ROUGH.,"They told us early in the morning, before we were out of bed, how, an"
1073,ROUGH.,"hour ago, Rough had died."

1240,BIRDS.,
1241,BIRDS.,"The wisdom of God is seen in every part of creation, and especially"
1242,BIRDS.,in the different kinds of birds. The beauty displayed in their
1243,BIRDS.,"graceful forms and varied colors strikes every beholder, while the"
1244,BIRDS.,"adaptation of their organs for the purposes of flight, their peculiar"
1245,BIRDS.,"habits and modes of living, are a constant source of admiration to the"
1246,BIRDS.,student of nature.
1247,BIRDS.,
1248,BIRDS.,Almost everything about the shape of a bird fits it for moving rapidly
1249,BIRDS.,"in the air, and all parts of its body are arranged so as to give it"
1250,BIRDS.,lightness along with strength. The soft and delicate plumage of birds
1251,BIRDS.,"protects them from cold or moisture; their wings, though so delicate,"
1252,BIRDS.,are furnished with muscles of such power as to strike the air with
1253,BIRDS.,"great force, whilst their tails act like the rudder of a ship, so that"
1254,BIRDS.,they can direct their course at pleasure with the utmost ease.
1255,BIRDS.,
1256,BIRDS.,The internal structure of a bird also is such as to help it to sustain
1257,BIRDS.,"itself in, and to fly quickly through, the air. Its lungs are pierced"
1258,BIRDS.,"with large holes, which allow air to pass into cavities in the breast,"
1259,BIRDS.,and even into the interior of the bones. It is thus not only rendered
1260,BIRDS.,"buoyant, but is enabled to breathe even while in rapid motion. Two"
1261,BIRDS.,"sparrows, it is said, require as much air to maintain their breathing"
1262,BIRDS.,properly as a guinea pig.
1263,BIRDS.,
1264,BIRDS.,"In many other ways the skill and goodness of God are seen in the ""fowl"
1265,BIRDS.,"of the air."" Their necks and beaks are long, and very movable, so that"
1266,BIRDS.,they may readily pick up food and other objects from the ground. The
1267,BIRDS.,muscles of their toes are so arranged that the simple weight of the
1268,BIRDS.,"body closes them, and they are able, in consequence, to sit on a perch"
1269,BIRDS.,a long time without fatigue. Even in a violent wind a bird easily
1270,BIRDS.,retains its hold of the branch or twig on which it is sitting. Their
1271,BIRDS.,bills are of almost all forms: in some kinds they are straight; in
1272,BIRDS.,"others curved, sometimes upwards and sometimes downwards; in others"
1273,BIRDS.,"they are flat; in some they are in the form of a cone, wedge-shaped,"
1274,BIRDS.,"or hooked. The bill enables a bird to take hold of its food, to strip"
1275,BIRDS.,"or divide it. It is useful also in carrying materials for its nest, or"
1276,BIRDS.,"food to its young; and in the birds of prey, such as the owl, the"
1277,BIRDS.,"hawk, the falcon, eagle, etc., the beak is a formidable weapon of"
1278,BIRDS.,attack.
1279,BIRDS.,
1280,BIRDS.,"The nostrils of birds are usually of an oval form, and are placed near"
1281,BIRDS.,the base of the beak. Their eyes are so constructed that they can see
1282,BIRDS.,"near and distant objects equally well, and their sight is very acute."
1283,BIRDS.,The sparrow-hawk discerns the small birds which are its prey at an
1284,BIRDS.,"incredible distance. No tribe of birds possesses an outward ear,"
1285,BIRDS.,except those which seek their food by night; these have one in the
1286,BIRDS.,"form of a thin, leathery piece of flesh. The inside ear, however, is"
1287,BIRDS.,"very large, and their hearing is very quick."
1288,BIRDS.,
1289,BIRDS.,[Illustration: BIRD'S NEST.]
1290,BIRDS.,
1291,BIRDS.,Another admirable feature in the structure of birds consists in their
1292,BIRDS.,"feathers. These are well adapted for security, warmth, and freedom of"
1293,BIRDS.,motion. The larger feathers of the body are placed over each other
1294,BIRDS.,"like the slates on the roof of a house, so that water is permitted to"
1295,BIRDS.,"run off, and cold is kept out. The down, which is placed under the"
1296,BIRDS.,"feathers, is a further protection against the cold; and hence it is"
1297,BIRDS.,most abundant in those species that are found in northern climates.
1298,BIRDS.,"The feathery covering of birds forms their peculiar beauty: on this,"
1299,BIRDS.,"in the warm climates, Nature bestows her most delicate and brightest"
1300,BIRDS.,colors.
1301,BIRDS.,
1302,BIRDS.,"[Illustration: {An apteryx, or kiwi}]"
1303,BIRDS.,
1304,BIRDS.,Another point which sets forth the resources of Infinite Wisdom is the
1305,BIRDS.,structure and uses of the wings of birds. The size of the wings is not
1306,BIRDS.,"always in proportion to the bulk of their bodies, but is accommodated"
1307,BIRDS.,"to their habits of living. Accordingly, birds of prey, swallows, and"
1308,BIRDS.,"such birds as are intended to hover long in the air, have much longer"
1309,BIRDS.,"wings, in proportion to their size, than hens, ducks, quails, etc. In"
1310,BIRDS.,"some, such as the ostrich, the cassiowary, and the penguin, the"
1311,BIRDS.,largest quill-feathers of the wing are entirely wanting.
1312,BIRDS.,
1313,BIRDS.,"Then, again, how varied is the flight of birds! The falcon soars above"
1314,BIRDS.,"the clouds, and remains in the air for many hours without any sign of"
1315,BIRDS.,"exertion. The swallow, the lark, and other species, sail long"
1316,BIRDS.,"distances with little effort. Others, like the sparrow and the"
1317,BIRDS.,"humming-bird, have a fluttering flight. Some, as the owl, fly without"
1318,BIRDS.,"any noise; and some, like the partridge, with a loud whir."
1319,BIRDS.,
1320,BIRDS.,"""Around the head"
1321,BIRDS.,Of wandering swain the white-winged plover wheels
1322,BIRDS.,"Her sounding flight, and then directly on"
1323,BIRDS.,"In long excursion skims the level lawn,"
1324,BIRDS.,"To tempt him from her nest."""
1325,BIRDS.,
1326,BIRDS.,"How graceful are the motions of the hawk, sweeping higher and higher"
1327,BIRDS.,"in circles, as he surveys far and wide the expanse of fields and"
1328,BIRDS.,"meadows below, in which he hopes to espy his prey. Our paper would be"
1329,BIRDS.,"too long were we to say even a little about the roosting, the"
1330,BIRDS.,"swimming, or running, the migration, the habits and instincts, the"
1331,BIRDS.,"varied notes and pleasant songs, of the endless species of birds."
1332,BIRDS.,
1333,BIRDS.,All these subjects are well worthy of being carefully studied; for
1334,BIRDS.,they all show the design of their Creator. The extraordinary creature
1335,BIRDS.,"represented in the engraving is the ""Apteryx,"" or ""wingless bird"" of"
1336,BIRDS.,New Zealand. It was not known to European naturalists till of late
1337,BIRDS.,"years, and for a long time the accounts which the natives of New"
1338,BIRDS.,"Zealand gave of it were discredited. A specimen of it, preserved in"
1339,BIRDS.,"brine, was, however, brought to this country, and a full description"
1340,BIRDS.,of the bird given.
1341,BIRDS.,
1342,BIRDS.,"The kirvi-kirvi, as the New Zealanders call it, stands about two feet"
1343,BIRDS.,"high. Its wings are so small that they can scarcely be called wings,"
1344,BIRDS.,and are not easy to find under the general plumage of the body. Its
1345,BIRDS.,"nostrils, strange to say, are at the tip of the beak. The toes are"
1346,BIRDS.,"strong, and well adapted for digging, the hind one being a thick,"
1347,BIRDS.,"horny spur. To add to the singularity of this creature, it has no tail"
1348,BIRDS.,whatever. The kirvi-kirvi conceals itself among the extensive beds of
1349,BIRDS.,"fern which abound in the middle island of New Zealand, and it makes a"
1350,BIRDS.,"nest of fern for its eggs in deep holes, which it hollows out of the"
1351,BIRDS.,"ground. It feeds on insects, and particularly worms, which it disturbs"
1352,BIRDS.,"by stamping on the ground, and seizes the instant they make their"
1353,BIRDS.,appearance. Night is the season when it is most active; and the
1354,BIRDS.,"natives hunt it by torchlight. When pursued, it elevates its head,"
1355,BIRDS.,"like an ostrich, and runs with great swiftness. It defends itself,"
1356,BIRDS.,"when overtaken, with much spirit, inflicting dangerous blows with its"
1357,BIRDS.,strong spur-armed feet.
1358,BIRDS.,
1359,BIRDS.,"In this instance, as in all others, God has wisely adapted the very"
1360,BIRDS.,shape and limbs of the creature to the habits by which it was intended
1361,BIRDS.,to be distinguished.

1448,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,had left in England was just the age of Katie; this inclined him all

1555,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"there. Bolton pressed his aching forehead, seeking to recall to his"
1556,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"memory what had happened, for he felt like one in a dream. Soon his"
1557,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"glance fell on the clock in the apothecary's shop, and at the same"
1558,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"instant the clock struck _one_! Bolton started to his feet, as if the"
1559,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,chime of the little bell had been the roar of a cannon.
1560,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1561,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""The Albion sails at one!"" cried the mate; and without so much as"
1562,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"stopping to look for his oilskin cap, with bandaged brow and"
1563,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"bareheaded, Bolton rushed forth into the street, and, dizzy as he"
1564,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"felt, staggered on towards the pier from which the vessel was to sail."
1565,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1566,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,It was not to be expected that the sailor's course should be a very
1567,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"straight one, or that with all his haste he should manage to make good"
1568,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,speed. The streets of New York seemed to be more full of traffic than
1569,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"usual, and twice the mate narrowly escaped being knocked down again by"
1570,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"some vehicle rapidly driven along the road. At last, breathless and"
1571,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"faint, and scarcely able to keep his feet, poor Bolton arrived at the"
1572,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,wharf to which his ship had been moored but an hour before. But the
1573,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,Albion was there no longer--the vessel had started without the
1574,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,mate--he could see her white sails in the distance; she was already
1575,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"on her way back to Old England, and she had left him behind!"
1576,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1577,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,This was a greater shock to poor Bolton than the blow from the falling
1578,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,ladder had been. He stood for several minutes gazing after the ship
1579,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"with a look of despair, then slowly the sailor returned to the house"
1580,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,of the Vales.
1581,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1582,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Nothing more unlucky could possibly have happened,"" muttered the mate"
1583,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"to himself. ""Here's a pretty scrape that I shall get into with my"
1584,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,employers; the mate of their vessel absent just at the time when he
1585,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"ought to have been at his post! Then I've nothing with me--nothing,"
1586,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"save the clothes that I stand in! All my luggage is now on the waves,"
1587,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,and a precious long time it will be before I shall see it again. But I
1588,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,don't care so much for the luggage; what I can't bear to think of is
1589,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,my wife and my children looking out eagerly for the arrival of the
1590,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"good ship Albion, and then, when she reaches port, finding that no Tom"
1591,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,Bolton is in her! I wish that that stupid basket had been at the
1592,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"bottom of the sea before ever I set eyes on it!"""
1593,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1594,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"Pale, haggard, and looking--as he was--greatly troubled, Bolton"
1595,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"entered the house of the Vales, which he so lately had quitted. The"
1596,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,family were just finishing their dinner; and not a little astonished
1597,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,were they to see one whom they had believed to be on the wide sea.
1598,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1599,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Here I am again, like a bad half-penny,"" said the sailor; and sitting"
1600,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"down wearily on a chair which Katie placed for him directly, Bolton"
1601,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,gave a short account of what he called the most unlucky mischance that
1602,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,had ever happened to him in the course of his life.
1603,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1604,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"The Vales felt much for his trouble, and begged him to remain with"
1605,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,them until he could get a passage in some other vessel bound for
1606,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,England.
1607,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1608,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,[Illustration: THE MAN AT THE WHEEL.]
1609,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1610,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""And don't take your accident so much to heart,"" softly whispered"
1611,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"little Katie; ""you know mother's favorite proverb--'Every cloud has a"
1612,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"silver lining.'"""
1613,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1614,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Sometimes, even in this life, we can see the silver edge round the"
1615,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"border,"" observed Mrs. Vale."
1616,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1617,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,Bolton had too brave a heart and too sensible a mind to give way long
1618,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"to fretting, though he did not see how so black a cloud as that which"
1619,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,hung over his sky could possibly have anything to brighten its gloom.
1620,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"He tried to make the best of that which he could not prevent, and"
1621,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"retired to rest that night with a tolerably cheerful face, though with"
1622,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"a violent headache, and a heartache which troubled him more."
1623,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1624,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"Bolton slept very little that night, nor indeed did any one else in"
1625,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,the house; for with the close of day there came on a violent storm
1626,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,which raged fiercely until the morning. Katie trembled in her little
1627,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"cot to hear how the gale roared and shrieked in the chimneys, and"
1628,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"rattled the window-frames, and threatened to burst open the doors. The"
1629,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"child raised her head from the pillow, and thanked the Lord that her"
1630,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,sailor friend was not tossing then on the waves.
1631,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1632,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,But far more thankful was Katie when tidings reached New York of what
1633,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,the storm had done on that terrible night. Bolton was sitting at
1634,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"breakfast with his friends on the third day after the tempest, when"
1635,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"Vale, who was reading the newspaper, turned to the part headed"
1636,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Shipping Intelligence."""
1637,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1638,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Any news?"" inquired Tom Bolton, struck by the expression on the face"
1639,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,of his friend.
1640,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1641,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"Instead of replying, Vale exclaimed, ""How little we can tell in this"
1642,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,life what is really for our evil or our good! You called that accident
1643,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"which prevented your sailing in the Albion an 'unlucky mischance.'"""
1644,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1645,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Of course I did. My wife and children are impatient to see me--"""
1646,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1647,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"""Had you sailed in that ship,"" interrupted Vale, ""they would never"
1648,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"have seen you again. The Albion went down in that storm!"""
1649,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,
1650,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"What was the regret of Tom Bolton on hearing of the disaster, and what"
1651,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"was his thankfulness for his own preservation, I leave the reader to"
1652,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,guess. Often in after days did the little American basket remind him
1653,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,in his own home of what others might have called the chance that led
1654,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,"him to turn back on his way to the ship, and so caused the accident"
1655,EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.,which vexed him so much at the time.

1679,BOOKS AND READING.,
1680,BOOKS AND READING.,
1681,BOOKS AND READING.,I really am in doubt whether or not the young folks ought to be
1682,BOOKS AND READING.,congratulated in consequence of the great number of juvenile books
1683,BOOKS AND READING.,which are being placed before them about this time. An excellent book
1684,BOOKS AND READING.,is certainly excellent company; but there is a limit to all things;
1685,BOOKS AND READING.,"and so we may have too many books, taking it for granted that all are"
1686,BOOKS AND READING.,good ones.
1687,BOOKS AND READING.,
1688,BOOKS AND READING.,"You all know, that, as a general rule, people in America read too"
1689,BOOKS AND READING.,"much, and think too little. Reading is a benefit to us only when it"
1690,BOOKS AND READING.,leads to reflection. It is useless when it leaves no lasting
1691,BOOKS AND READING.,impression on the mind; it is _worse_ than useless if the lesson it
1692,BOOKS AND READING.,conveys be not a really good one.
1693,BOOKS AND READING.,
1694,BOOKS AND READING.,Suppose you sit down to a well-furnished table at a hotel to eat your
1695,BOOKS AND READING.,"dinner. The waiter hands you a bill of fare, upon which is printed a"
1696,BOOKS AND READING.,"long list of good and wholesome dishes, and then quietly waits until"
1697,BOOKS AND READING.,"you order what you wish. You are not expected to eat of every one,"
1698,BOOKS AND READING.,"however attractive they may be, but rather to select what you like"
1699,BOOKS AND READING.,"best,--enough to make a modest meal,--and let that suffice."
1700,BOOKS AND READING.,
1701,BOOKS AND READING.,But the selection is not all. If you expect to gain health and
1702,BOOKS AND READING.,"strength by your dinner, you must eat it in a proper manner; that is,"
1703,BOOKS AND READING.,"slowly. Otherwise nature's work will be imperfectly done, and your"
1704,BOOKS AND READING.,"food become a source of bodily harm, instead of a benefit."
1705,BOOKS AND READING.,
1706,BOOKS AND READING.,"Now, it is precisely so with the food of the mind, which comes to you"
1707,BOOKS AND READING.,through books. You are not expected to read everything which comes
1708,BOOKS AND READING.,"within your reach. You should rather select the best, and, having done"
1709,BOOKS AND READING.,"so, read them slowly and carefully. You may read too much as well as"
1710,BOOKS AND READING.,"eat too much; and while the one will injure your body, the other will"
1711,BOOKS AND READING.,as certainly harm your mind.
1712,BOOKS AND READING.,
1713,BOOKS AND READING.,One of the worst evils which too much reading leads to is a habit of
1714,BOOKS AND READING.,"_reading to forget_. You know what a bad habit is, how it clings to"
1715,BOOKS AND READING.,"us, when once contracted, and how hard it is to be shaken off. Some"
1716,BOOKS AND READING.,"boys and girls read a book entirely through in a single evening, and"
1717,BOOKS AND READING.,"the next day are eagerly at work on another, to be as quickly"
1718,BOOKS AND READING.,"mastered. No mind, however strong, can stand such a strain. You see at"
1719,BOOKS AND READING.,once that it would be absolutely impossible for them to remember what
1720,BOOKS AND READING.,"they read. And so they read for a momentary enjoyment, and gradually"
1721,BOOKS AND READING.,fall into the habit I have spoken of--reading to forget. I need not
1722,BOOKS AND READING.,tell you that such a habit is fatal to any very high position in life.
1723,BOOKS AND READING.,
1724,BOOKS AND READING.,"How often we hear parents boast that their children are ""great"
1725,BOOKS AND READING.,"readers,"" just as if their intelligence should, in their opinion, be"
1726,BOOKS AND READING.,measured by the number of books and papers which they had read! Need I
1727,BOOKS AND READING.,"say, that, on the contrary, they are objects of pity?"
1728,BOOKS AND READING.,
1729,BOOKS AND READING.,But how much may we read with profit? That is a question not always
1730,BOOKS AND READING.,"easy to answer. Some can read a great deal more than others. Yet, if"
1731,BOOKS AND READING.,"young people read slowly, and think a great deal about the subject,"
1732,BOOKS AND READING.,"there is very little danger of their reading too much, provided they"
1733,BOOKS AND READING.,select only good books; because good books are very scarce--much more
1734,BOOKS AND READING.,so in proportion to the number printed than they were twenty years
1735,BOOKS AND READING.,ago; and there are very few young persons who have too great a supply
1736,BOOKS AND READING.,of good works placed within their reach.
1737,BOOKS AND READING.,
1738,BOOKS AND READING.,"I have mentioned one evil which results from too much reading, and"
1739,BOOKS AND READING.,will only briefly allude to another equally important. Children who
1740,BOOKS AND READING.,attend school have no time to devote to worthless books. Their studies
1741,BOOKS AND READING.,"consume many hours. If, aside from the time which should be devoted to"
1742,BOOKS AND READING.,"play, to their meals, and the various duties of home, they will read a"
1743,BOOKS AND READING.,"useless book every day or two, their health is sure to suffer. The"
1744,BOOKS AND READING.,"evil consequences may not be at once apparent, but in later years the"
1745,BOOKS AND READING.,"penalty will certainly have to be paid. This reflection alone, if"
1746,BOOKS AND READING.,"there were no other reason, should induce the young to discard all"
1747,BOOKS AND READING.,"useless books, and read only such as shall have a tendency to make"
1748,BOOKS AND READING.,them wiser and better.

1771,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1772,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1773,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"Lion, who was a cross between a Great St. Bernard and a Newfoundland"
1774,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"dog, came into the possession of the superintendent of the London fire"
1775,LION THE FIRE DOG.,brigade when he was but twelve months old. His first retreat was in
1776,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the engine-house, where, on some old hose and sacking, he made himself"
1777,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"as comfortable as he could, and coiled himself up, like the tubing on"
1778,LION THE FIRE DOG.,which he lay. Considering that he was thus placed in charge of the
1779,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"engine-house, he resented the first occasion on which a fire occurred"
1780,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"at night. The fire bell rang, and the firemen crowded to the spot,"
1781,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"prepared to draw forth the engine, when a decided opposition was made"
1782,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"on the part of Lion, who showed a determination to fasten himself on"
1783,LION THE FIRE DOG.,the first fireman who dared to enter the house. In this way the
1784,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"faithful dog kept them all at bay until the arrival of his master,"
1785,LION THE FIRE DOG.,whom he instantly recognized and obeyed. As soon as the horses were
1786,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"harnessed, and the engine was in motion, Lion bounded along in"
1787,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"company, and was present at his first fire. After that time, he"
1788,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"attended no less than three hundred and thirty-two fires, and not"
1789,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"only attended, but assisted at them, always useful, and sometimes"
1790,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"doing work and saving life, which, but for him, would have been lost."
1791,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1792,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"His chief friends, the firemen, say it would take a long while to tell"
1793,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"all his acts of daring and sagacity; but we must, in justice to his"
1794,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"memory, record some of the most notable."
1795,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1796,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"Whenever the fire bell rang, Lion was immediately on the alert,"
1797,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"barking loudly, as if to spread the dire alarm. Then, as soon as his"
1798,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"master had taken his place on the engine, and before the horses were"
1799,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"off, he led the way, clearing the road and warning every one of the"
1800,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"approach of the engine, and spreading the news of the fire by his loud"
1801,LION THE FIRE DOG.,voice.
1802,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1803,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"On one occasion, when the horses were tearing along the streets as"
1804,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"fire engine horses alone can, a little child was seen just in front of"
1805,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the engine. To stop the horses in time was impossible, though the"
1806,LION THE FIRE DOG.,driver did his best. The brave hearts of the firemen sank within them
1807,LION THE FIRE DOG.,as they felt they must drive over the little body. Bystanders raised
1808,LION THE FIRE DOG.,their arms and shrieked as they witnessed an impending catastrophe
1809,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"which they could do nothing to avert. No human help could avail, and"
1810,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"it must needs be that the engine of mercy, on its way to save life,"
1811,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"must sacrifice the life of an innocent, helpless child!"
1812,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1813,LION THE FIRE DOG.,But stay! Human eyes were not the only ones that took in that sad
1814,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"scene, and that saw the impending doom of the little one. Brave,"
1815,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"sagacious, and fleet, Lion saw at a glance the danger that threatened"
1816,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the child, and springing forward, he knocked him down; then seizing"
1817,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"him firmly in his jaws, he made for the pavement obliquely, and gently"
1818,LION THE FIRE DOG.,deposited his charge in the gutter just as the engine went tearing by.
1819,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1820,LION THE FIRE DOG.,But this was only an incident by the way; Lion's real work began when
1821,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the scene of the fire was reached. As soon as the door was opened, or"
1822,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"dashing through the window if there was a delay in opening the door,"
1823,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the noble animal would run all over the burning house, barking, so as"
1824,LION THE FIRE DOG.,to arouse the inmates if they were unaware of the danger; and never
1825,LION THE FIRE DOG.,would he leave the fire until he had either aroused them or had drawn
1826,LION THE FIRE DOG.,the attention of the firemen to them.
1827,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1828,LION THE FIRE DOG.,Once the firemen could not account for his conduct. Darting into the
1829,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"burning house,--the ceilings of which had given way,--and then out"
1830,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"again to the firemen, he howled and yelled most loudly. It was"
1831,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"believed that no one was in the house, but Lion's conduct made his"
1832,LION THE FIRE DOG.,master feel uneasy.
1833,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1834,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"Still nothing could be done by way of entering the house, as the fire"
1835,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"was raging fiercely, and the house would soon fall in. Finding that"
1836,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"his entreaties were not regarded, and suffering from burns and"
1837,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"injuries, the noble animal discontinued his efforts, but ran uneasily"
1838,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"round the engine, howling in a piteous manner; nor would he leave the"
1839,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"spot after the fire was put out until search was made, when beneath"
1840,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"the still smouldering embers, the firemen discovered the charred body"
1841,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"of an old man, whom he had done his utmost to save."
1842,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1843,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"Lion's noble efforts, however, were often crowned with success; and"
1844,LION THE FIRE DOG.,many a one has to bless the wondrous qualities with which God had
1845,LION THE FIRE DOG.,endowed him.
1846,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1847,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"At one fire, after the inmates had made their escape, a cry was raised"
1848,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"that ""the baby had been left behind in the cradle up stairs,"" though"
1849,LION THE FIRE DOG.,no one seemed to be able to indicate the room. The fire had so far got
1850,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"hold of the dwelling, such dense volumes of flame and smoke were"
1851,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"issuing from every opening, that it was impossible for any fireman to"
1852,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"enter, and the crowd stood horror-stricken at the thought of the"
1853,LION THE FIRE DOG.,perishing babe.
1854,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1855,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"The crisis was a terrible one; an effort was made, an entry was"
1856,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"effected, and some of the men ventured some distance within the"
1857,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"burning pile, only to retrace their steps."
1858,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1859,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"At this emergency, Lion dashed past the men, disappeared amid the"
1860,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"flames, but returned in a minute into the street with the empty cradle"
1861,LION THE FIRE DOG.,in his powerful jaws. The consequence of this almost incredible
1862,LION THE FIRE DOG.,feat--which was witnessed by many--may be better imagined than
1863,LION THE FIRE DOG.,described.
1864,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1865,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"The fact that Lion did not re-enter the house--which, though badly"
1866,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"burned, he would doubtless have done had he left the child behind--was"
1867,LION THE FIRE DOG.,sufficient to convince the dullest intellect that the child was
1868,LION THE FIRE DOG.,secure; and it was very soon ascertained that the object of search was
1869,LION THE FIRE DOG.,safe in a neighboring house.
1870,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1871,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"No wonder, then, that this noble animal endeared himself to all who"
1872,LION THE FIRE DOG.,knew him; and those who knew him best loved him the most. For fourteen
1873,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"years Lion continued his noble and useful career as public benefactor,"
1874,LION THE FIRE DOG.,"as friend and companion to the firemen, and as mourner at their"
1875,LION THE FIRE DOG.,graves; for he attended the funerals of no less than eleven of them.
1876,LION THE FIRE DOG.,
1877,LION THE FIRE DOG.,Death came to him at length; for last year he died from injuries

2078,HELP YOURSELVES.,Many boys and girls make a failure in life because they do not learn
2079,HELP YOURSELVES.,to help themselves. They depend on father and mother even to hang up
2080,HELP YOURSELVES.,their hats and to find their playthings. When they become men and
2081,HELP YOURSELVES.,"women, they will depend on husbands and wives to do the same thing. ""A"
2082,HELP YOURSELVES.,"nail to hang a hat on,"" said an old man of eighty years, ""is worth"
2083,HELP YOURSELVES.,"everything to a boy."" He had been ""through the mill,"" as people say,"
2084,HELP YOURSELVES.,"so that he knew. His mother had a nail for him when he was a boy--""a"
2085,HELP YOURSELVES.,"nail to hang his hat on,"" and nothing else. It was ""Henry's nail"" from"
2086,HELP YOURSELVES.,"January to January, year in and out, and no other member of the family"
2087,HELP YOURSELVES.,was allowed to appropriate it for any purpose whatever. If the broom
2088,HELP YOURSELVES.,"by chance was hung thereon, or an apron or coat, it was soon removed,"
2089,HELP YOURSELVES.,"because that nail was ""to hang Henry's hat on."" And that nail did much"
2090,HELP YOURSELVES.,"for Henry; it helped make him what he was in manhood--a careful,"
2091,HELP YOURSELVES.,"systematic, orderly man, at home and abroad, on his farm and in his"
2092,HELP YOURSELVES.,house. He never wanted another to do what he could do for himself.
2093,HELP YOURSELVES.,
2094,HELP YOURSELVES.,"Young folks are apt to think that certain things, good in themselves,"
2095,HELP YOURSELVES.,"are not honorable. To be a blacksmith or a bootmaker, to work on a"
2096,HELP YOURSELVES.,"farm or drive a team, is beneath their dignity, as compared with being"
2097,HELP YOURSELVES.,"a merchant, or practising medicine or law. This is PRIDE, an enemy to"
2098,HELP YOURSELVES.,success and happiness. No _necessary_ labor is discreditable. It is
2099,HELP YOURSELVES.,never dishonorable to be _useful_. It is beneath no one's dignity to
2100,HELP YOURSELVES.,earn bread by the sweat of the brow. When boys who have such false
2101,HELP YOURSELVES.,"notions of dignity become men, they are ashamed to help themselves as"
2102,HELP YOURSELVES.,"they ought, and for want of this quality they live and die unhonored."
2103,HELP YOURSELVES.,"Trying to save their dignity, they lose it."
2104,HELP YOURSELVES.,
2105,HELP YOURSELVES.,Here is a fact we have from a very successful merchant. When he began
2106,HELP YOURSELVES.,"business for himself, he carried his wares from shop to shop. At"
2107,HELP YOURSELVES.,"length his business increased to such an extent, that he hired a room"
2108,HELP YOURSELVES.,"at the Marlboro' Hotel, in Boston, during the business season, and"
2109,HELP YOURSELVES.,"thither the merchants, having been duly notified, would repair to make"
2110,HELP YOURSELVES.,"purchases. Among all his customers, there was only one man who would"
2111,HELP YOURSELVES.,carry to his store the goods which he had purchased. The buyers asked
2112,HELP YOURSELVES.,"to have their goods carried, and often this manufacturer would carry"
2113,HELP YOURSELVES.,"them himself. But there was one merchant, and the largest buyer of the"
2114,HELP YOURSELVES.,"whole number, who was not ashamed to be seen carrying a case of goods"
2115,HELP YOURSELVES.,"through the streets. Sometimes he would purchase four cases, and he"
2116,HELP YOURSELVES.,"would say, ""Now, I will take two, and you take two, and we will carry"
2117,HELP YOURSELVES.,"them right over to the store."" So the manufacturer and the merchant"
2118,HELP YOURSELVES.,often went through the streets of Boston quite heavily loaded. This
2119,HELP YOURSELVES.,"merchant, of all the number who went to the Marlboro' Hotel for their"
2120,HELP YOURSELVES.,"purchases, succeeded in business. He became a wealthy man when all the"
2121,HELP YOURSELVES.,"others failed. The manufacturer, who was not ashamed to help himself,"
2122,HELP YOURSELVES.,"is now living--one of the wealthy men of Massachusetts, ready to aid,"
2123,HELP YOURSELVES.,"by his generous gifts, every good object that comes along, and honored"
2124,HELP YOURSELVES.,by all who know him.

2249,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2250,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""Oh, because I'm nothing to her, she says, and she doesn't want the"
2251,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"trouble of me."" He tried to say this in a brave, don't-care sort of"
2252,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"way, but his voice faltered and he dropped his eyes to the floor. How"
2253,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,pitiful he looked!
2254,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2255,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""Poor child!"" I could not help saying aloud."
2256,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2257,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"Light flashed over his pale face. It was something new to him, this"
2258,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,interest and compassion.
2259,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2260,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""One of God's little lambs."" I heard the voice in my heart saying this"
2261,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,again. Nobody to love him--nobody to care for him. Poor little boy!
2262,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"The hand of my own child, my son who is so very dear to me, had led"
2263,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,him in through our door and claimed for him the love and care so long
2264,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,a stranger to his heart. Could I send him out and shut the door upon
2265,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"him, when I knew that he had no mother and no home? If I heeded not"
2266,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"the cry of this little one precious in God's sight, might I not be"
2267,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,thought unworthy to be the guardian of another lamb of his fold whom I
2268,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,loved as my own life?
2269,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2270,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""I've got heaps of clothes, mother--a great many more than I want. And"
2271,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"my bed is wide. There's room enough in the house, and we've plenty to"
2272,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"eat,"" said Harvey, pleading for the child. I could not withstand all"
2273,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"these appeals. Rising, I told the little stranger to follow me. When"
2274,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"we came back to the sitting-room half an hour afterward, Jim Peters"
2275,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"would hardly have been known by his old acquaintances, if any of them"
2276,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,had been there. A bath and clean clothes had made a wonderful change
2277,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,in him.
2278,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2279,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"I watched the poor little boy, as he and Harvey played during the"
2280,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"afternoon, with no little concern of mind. What was I to do with him?"
2281,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"Clean and neatly dressed, there was a look of refinement about the"
2282,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,child which had nearly all been hidden by rags and dirt. He played
2283,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"gently, and his voice had in it a sweetness of tone, as it fell every"
2284,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"now and then upon my ears, that was really winning. Send him back to"
2285,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,Mrs. Flint's in Blake's Court? The change I had wrought upon him made
2286,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"this impossible. No, he could not be sent back to Mrs. Flint's, who"
2287,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,didn't want the trouble of him. What then?
2288,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2289,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,[Illustration: THE MOTHERLESS BOY.]
2290,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2291,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"Do the kind hearts of my little readers repeat the question, ""What"
2292,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"then?"" Do they want very much to know what has become of little Jim"
2293,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,Peters?
2294,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2295,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"It is just a year since my boy led him in from the street, and Jim is"
2296,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,still in our house. No one came for him. No one inquired about him. No
2297,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,one cared for him. I must take that last sentence back. God cared for
2298,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"him, and by the hand of my tender-hearted son brought him into my"
2299,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"comfortable home and said to me, ""Here is one of my lambs, astray,"
2300,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,hungry and cold. He was born into the world that he might become an
2301,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"angel in heaven, but is in danger of being lost. I give him into your"
2302,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"care. Let me find him when I call my sheep by their names."""
2303,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2304,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,As I finished writing the last sentence a voice close to my ear said
2305,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""Mother!"" I turned and received a loving kiss from the lips of Jim. He"
2306,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"often does this. I think, in the midst of his happy plays, memory"
2307,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"takes him back to the suffering past, and then his grateful heart runs"
2308,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,over and he tries to reward me with a loving kiss. I did not tell him
2309,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"to call me ""Mother."" At first he said it in a timid, hesitating way,"
2310,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"and with such a pleading, half-scared look that I was touched and"
2311,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,softened.
2312,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2313,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""She isn't your real mother,"" said Harvey, who happened to be near,"
2314,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""but then she's good and loves you ever so much."""
2315,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,
2316,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"""And I love her,"" answered Jim, with a great throb in his throat,"
2317,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,hiding his face in my lap and clasping and kissing my hand. Since then
2318,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"he always calls me ""Mother;"" and the God and Father of us all has sent"
2319,THE MOTHERLESS BOY.,"into my heart a mother's love for him, and I pray that he may be mine"

2349,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,By the pass of the Great St. Bernard travellers cross the Pennine
2350,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Alps (Penn, a Celtic word, meaning _height_) along the mountain road"
2351,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"which leads from Martigny, in Switzerland, to Aosta, in Piedmont. On"
2352,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"the crest of the pass, eight thousand two hundred feet above the sea"
2353,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"level, stands the Hospice, tenanted by about a dozen monks."
2354,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2355,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,This is supposed to be the highest spot in Europe inhabited by human
2356,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"beings. The climate is necessarily rigorous, the thermometer in winter"
2357,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"being often twenty-nine degrees below zero, whilst sixty-eight degrees"
2358,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,Fahrenheit is about the highest range ever attained in summer. From
2359,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"the extreme difficulty of respiration, few of the monks ever survive"
2360,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"the period of their vow, which is fifteen years, commencing at the age"
2361,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,of eighteen.
2362,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2363,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"This hospice is said to have been first founded in the year 962, by"
2364,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Bernard, a Piedmontese nobleman. It will be remembered that it was"
2365,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"over this pass Napoleon, in May, 1800, led an army of thirty thousand"
2366,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"men into Italy, having with them heavy artillery and cavalry."
2367,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2368,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,For poor travellers and traders the hospice is really a place of
2369,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"refuge. During winter, crossing this pass is a very dangerous affair."
2370,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"The snow falls in small particles, and remains as dry as dust."
2371,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Whirlwinds, called ""tourmentes,"" catch up this light snow, and"
2372,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"carrying it with blinding violence against the traveller, burying"
2373,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"every landmark, at once put an end to knowledge of position."
2374,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Avalanches, too, are of frequent occurrence."
2375,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2376,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"After violent storms, or the fall of avalanches, or any other unusual"
2377,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"severity of winter weather, the monks set out in search of travellers"
2378,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,who may have been overwhelmed by the snow in their ascent of the
2379,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,pass. They are generally accompanied in their search by dogs of a
2380,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"peculiar breed, commonly known as the St. Bernard's Dog, on account of"
2381,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,the celebrated monastery where these magnificent animals are taught to
2382,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"exercise their wondrous powers, which have gained for them and their"
2383,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"teachers a world-wide fame. On their neck is a bell, to attract the"
2384,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,attention of any belated wayfarer; and their deep and powerful bay
2385,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,quickly gives notice to the benevolent monks to hurry to the relief of
2386,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,any unfortunate traveller they may find.
2387,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2388,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Some of the dogs carry, attached to their collars, a flask of spirits"
2389,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,or other restorative. Their wonderfully acute sense of smell enables
2390,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,them to detect the bodies of persons buried deeply beneath the surface
2391,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"of the snow, and thus direct the searchers where to dig for them. The"
2392,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"animal's instinct seems to teach it, too, where hidden chasms or"
2393,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"clefts, filled with loose snow, are; for it carefully avoids them, and"
2394,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,thus is an all-important guide to the monks themselves.
2395,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2396,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,We have stories without number as to what these dogs accomplish on
2397,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"their own account; how they dig out travellers, and bring them,"
2398,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"sometimes unaided by man, to the hospice."
2399,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2400,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,[Illustration: THE ST. BERNARD DOG.]
2401,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2402,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,A few years ago one of these faithful animals might be seen wearing a
2403,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"medal, and regarded with much affection by all. This noble dog had"
2404,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,well deserved the distinction; for one stormy day he had saved
2405,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"twenty-two individuals buried in their snowy envelope. Unfortunately,"
2406,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"he met, at a subsequent period, the very fate from which he had"
2407,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,rescued so many persons. At the worst season an Italian courier was
2408,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"crossing the pass, attended by two monks, each escorted by a dog"
2409,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"(one being the wearer of the medal), when suddenly a vast avalanche"
2410,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"shot down upon them with lightning speed, and they were all lost."
2411,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2412,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Another of these dogs, named ""Barry,"" had served the St. Bernard"
2413,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Convent during twelve years, and had saved the lives of fifteen"
2414,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,persons during that time. Whenever the pass was obscured by fogs and
2415,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"wintry snow-storms, he would go forth in search of lost travellers. It"
2416,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"was his practice to run barking till he lost his breath, and he would"
2417,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"venture into the most dangerous places. If, as sometimes happened, he"
2418,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,did not succeed in drawing out from the snow some traveller stiffened
2419,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"with cold or overcome with exhaustion, he would run back to the"
2420,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,convent and fetch some of the monks.
2421,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2422,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,One day this brave dog found a little child in a half-frozen state. He
2423,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"began directly to lick him, and having succeeded first in restoring"
2424,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"animation, and next in the complete resuscitation of the boy, he"
2425,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"induced the child, by his caresses, to tie himself on his back. When"
2426,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"this was effected, he transported the poor child, as if in triumph, to"
2427,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"the hospice. When overtaken by old age, the glorious dog was pensioned"
2428,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"off by way of reward, and after his death his body was stuffed and"
2429,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,placed in the museum at Berne.
2430,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2431,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,It is said that dogs of this variety inherit the faculty of tracking
2432,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,footsteps in snow. A gentleman once obtained a pup which had been
2433,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,produced in London by a female of the St. Bernard breed. The young
2434,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"animal was brought to Scotland, where it was never observed to give"
2435,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,any particular tokens of a power of tracking footsteps until winter.
2436,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Then, when the ground was covered with snow, it showed the utmost"
2437,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"inclination to follow footsteps; and such was its power of doing so,"
2438,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,that though its master might attempt to confuse it by walking in the
2439,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"most irregular fashion, and by inducing other persons to cross his"
2440,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"path in all directions, yet it always followed his course with great"
2441,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,precision.
2442,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2443,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Sir Thomas Dick Lander, who for many years resided at Grange House,"
2444,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Edinburgh, had a fine dog of the St. Bernard breed presented to him."
2445,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,Its bark was so loud that it could be distinguished at the distance of
2446,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"a mile. Its bark once led to its recovery, when stolen by some"
2447,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"carters. ""Bass,"" as the dog was named, had been missing for some time,"
2448,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"when it was brought back to Grange House by a letter-carrier, who said"
2449,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"that in going along a certain street, he heard a barking inside a"
2450,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"yard, and at once recognized the voice of Bass. ""He knocked at the"
2451,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"gate,"" writes Sir Thomas, ""and immediately said to the owner of the"
2452,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"premises,--"
2453,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2454,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""'You have got Sir Thomas Lander's big dog.'"
2455,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2456,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""The man denied it."
2457,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2458,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""'But I know you have,' continued the letter-carrier. 'I am certain"
2459,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,that I heard the bark of Sir Thomas's big dog; for there is no other
2460,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,dog in or about all Edinburgh that has such a bark.'
2461,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2462,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""The man then admitted that he had a large dog, which he had bought"
2463,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"for a trifle from a couple of coal carters; and at last, with great"
2464,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"reluctance, he gave up the dog to the letter-carrier, who brought him"
2465,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"home here."""
2466,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2467,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"Sir Thomas, after describing many of Bass's characteristics, then"
2468,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,proceeds:--
2469,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2470,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""He took a particular fancy for one of the postmen who delivers"
2471,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"letters here, though he was not the man whom I have already had"
2472,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"occasion to mention. It was the duty of this postman I now allude to,"
2473,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"besides delivering letters, to carry a letter-bag from one receiving"
2474,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"house to another, and this big bag he used to give Bass to carry. Bass"
2475,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,always followed that man through all the villas in the neighborhood
2476,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"where he had deliveries to make, and he invariably parted with him"
2477,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"opposite to the gate of the Convent of St. Margaret's, and returned"
2478,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,home.
2479,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2480,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""When our gate was shut, to prevent his following the postman, the dog"
2481,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"always leaped a high wall to get after him. One day, when the postman"
2482,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"was ill, or detained by some accidental circumstance, he sent a man in"
2483,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"his place. Bass went up to the man, curiously scanning his face,"
2484,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"whilst the man retired from the dog, by no means liking his"
2485,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"appearance, and very anxious to decline all acquaintance with him. But"
2486,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"as the man left the place, Bass followed him, showing strong symptoms"
2487,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,that he was determined to have the post-bag. The man did all he could
2488,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"to keep the possession of it. But at length Bass, seeing that he had"
2489,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"no chance of getting possession of the bag by civil entreaty, raised"
2490,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"himself on his hind legs, and putting a great fore paw on each of the"
2491,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"man's shoulders, he laid him flat on his back in the road, and quietly"
2492,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"picking up the bag, he proceeded peaceably on his wonted way. The man,"
2493,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"much dismayed, arose and followed the dog, making, every now and then,"
2494,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,an ineffectual attempt to coax him to give it up.
2495,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,
2496,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"""At the first house he came to he told his fears and the dilemma he"
2497,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,was in; but the people comforted him by telling him that the dog
2498,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,always carried the bag. Bass walked with the man to all the houses at
2499,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"which he delivered letters, and along the road till he came to the"
2500,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"gate of St. Margaret's, where he dropped the bag; and making his bow"
2501,THE ST. BERNARD DOG.,"to the man, he returned home."""

2589,REASON AND INSTINCT.,aroused the people to a sense of their danger.

2591,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"""As I was walking out one frosty morning with a large Newfoundland"
2592,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"dog,"" says the Rev. J. C. Atkinson, ""I observed the animal's repeated"
2593,REASON AND INSTINCT.,disappointment on putting his head down to drink at sundry ice-covered
2594,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"pools. After one of these disappointments, I broke the ice with my"
2595,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"foot for my thirsty companion. The next time Tiger was thirsty, he did"
2596,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"not wait for me to 'break the ice,' but with his foot, or, if too"
2597,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"strong, by jumping upon it, he obtained water for himself."""

2602,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"After the battle of Fredericksburg, it fell to my duty to search a"
2603,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"given district for any dead or wounded soldiers there might be left,"
2604,REASON AND INSTINCT.,and to bring relief. Near an old brick dwelling I discovered a soldier
2605,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"in gray who seemed to be dead. Lying by his side was a noble dog, with"
2606,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"his head flat upon his master's neck. As I approached, the dog raised"
2607,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"his eyes to me good-naturedly, and began wagging his tail; but he did"
2608,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"not change his position. The fact that the animal did not growl, that"
2609,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"he did not move, but, more than all, the intelligent, joyful"
2610,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"expression of his face, convinced me that the man was only wounded,"
2611,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"which proved to be the case. A bullet had pierced his throat, and"
2612,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"faint from the loss of blood, he had fallen down where he lay. His dog"
2613,REASON AND INSTINCT.,had _actually stopped the bleeding from the wound by laying his head
2614,REASON AND INSTINCT.,"across it_. Whether this was casual or not, I cannot say. But the"
2615,REASON AND INSTINCT.,shaggy coat of the faithful creature was completely matted with his

2691,A TALE FOR CHILDREN.,"""Here, at least, I shall find peace; these gentle flowers will give me"

2696,A TALE FOR CHILDREN.,"With a low sigh it turned to the pansy near. Well, the pansy _wished_"

2790,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,"""And so you lose all chance of getting on, and being able in time to"

2793,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,
2794,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,"""It's Willy,"" said the boy; ""yes, you may look, Pearson. Mother had it"

2836,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,"""Let me see what sort of a head-nurse you can make,"" said the captain"

2842,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,
2843,WORKING IS BETTER THAN WISHING.,They dressed Carlo up in a suit of sailor clothes. To be sure they

2932,THAT CALF!,"Shut the barn door, while I was abed?"""
2933,THAT CALF!,Each one of them all shook his head.
2934,THAT CALF!,
2935,THAT CALF!,"Now the little calf Spot, she was down in the lot;"
2936,THAT CALF!,And the way the rest talked was a shame;
2937,THAT CALF!,"For no one, night before, saw her shut up the door;"
2938,THAT CALF!,"But they said that she did,--all the same,--"
2939,THAT CALF!,For they always made her take the blame.
2940,THAT CALF!,
2941,THAT CALF!,"Said the horse (dapple gray), ""I was not up that way"
2942,THAT CALF!,"Last night, as I now recollect;"""
2943,THAT CALF!,"And the bull, passing by, tossed his horns very high,"
2944,THAT CALF!,"And said, ""Let who may here object,"
2945,THAT CALF!,"I say 'tis that calf I suspect!"""
2946,THAT CALF!,
2947,THAT CALF!,"Then out spoke the cow, ""It is terrible, now,"
2948,THAT CALF!,"To accuse honest folks of such tricks."""
2949,THAT CALF!,"Said the cock in the tree, ""I'm sure 'twasn't me;"""
2950,THAT CALF!,"And the sheep all cried, ""Bah!"" (There were six.)"
2951,THAT CALF!,"""Now that calf's got herself in a fix!"""
2952,THAT CALF!,
2953,THAT CALF!,"""Why, of course, we all knew 'twas the wrong thing to do."""
2954,THAT CALF!,"Said the chickens. ""Of course,"" said the cat;"
2955,THAT CALF!,"""I suppose,"" cried the mule, ""some folks think me a fool;"
2956,THAT CALF!,But I'm not quite so simple as that;
2957,THAT CALF!,"The poor calf never knows what she's at!"""
2958,THAT CALF!,
2959,THAT CALF!,"Just that moment, the calf, who was always the laugh"
2960,THAT CALF!,"And the jest of the yard, came in sight."
2961,THAT CALF!,"""Did you shut my barn door?"" asked the farmer once more."
2962,THAT CALF!,"""I did, sir; I closed it last night,"""
2963,THAT CALF!,"Said the calf; ""and I thought that was right."""
2964,THAT CALF!,
2965,THAT CALF!,"Then each one shook his head. ""She will catch it,"" they said;"
2966,THAT CALF!,"""Serve her right for her meddlesome way!"""
2967,THAT CALF!,"Said the farmer, ""Come here, little bossy, my dear!"
2968,THAT CALF!,"You have done what I cannot repay,"
2969,THAT CALF!,And your fortune is made from to-day.
2970,THAT CALF!,
2971,THAT CALF!,"""For a wonder, last night, I forgot the door, quite;"
2972,THAT CALF!,"And if you had not shut it so neat,"
2973,THAT CALF!,"All my colts had slipped in, and gone right to the bin,"
2974,THAT CALF!,And got what they ought not to eat--
2975,THAT CALF!,"They'd have foundered themselves upon wheat."""
2976,THAT CALF!,
2977,THAT CALF!,Then each hoof of them all began loudly to bawl;
2978,THAT CALF!,The very mule smiled; the cock crew;
2979,THAT CALF!,"""Little Spotty, my dear, you're a favorite here,"""
2980,THAT CALF!,"They cried. ""We all said it was you,"
2981,THAT CALF!,"We were so glad to give you your due."""
2982,THAT CALF!,"And the calf answered, knowingly, ""Boo!"""

3039,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3040,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,This picture of three curious little puppies looking at a tortoise
3041,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,reminds me of a story told of a countryman who saw some land-tortoises
3042,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,for the first time at a fair held in a market-place of his native
3043,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"village. Very much surprised at their queer look, he asked the man who"
3044,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,was selling them how much they were.
3045,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3046,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"""Eighteenpence a pair,"" was the answer."
3047,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3048,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"""Eighteenpence!"" said the man; ""that is a great deal for a thing like"
3049,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"a frog. What will you take for one _without the box_?"""
3050,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3051,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,Little folks would not make such a stupid mistake as this; they would
3052,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,know that this strange-looking animal between its two shells was a
3053,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"tortoise. There are different sorts--some that live on land, and some"
3054,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"in water. Those that live in the sea are called turtles, and their"
3055,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,shells are not so hard as that of the land-tortoise. It is easy to see
3056,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,why this is: a turtle would not be able to swim with so thick a shell;
3057,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,it would be much as if a man in armor were to try. Their shells are
3058,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"not all in one, but joined together by a sort of gristle, which"
3059,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,enables them to move with greater ease and not so stiffly.
3060,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3061,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"Directly any one hears the name of tortoise, he begins to think of"
3062,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"tortoise-shell. This ought really to be called turtle-shell, as it is"
3063,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,made from the shell of the hawk's-bill turtle. Tortoise-shell is made
3064,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,by soaking the plates of the shell in warm water until they are soft;
3065,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"then they are pressed into the shapes wanted in warm iron moulds, and"
3066,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,taken out and polished.
3067,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3068,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,Some of the sea-turtles are very fierce; and although they have no
3069,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"teeth, their jaws are so strong that they can bite a walking-stick in"
3070,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,half. Land-tortoises are quite harmless; they only attack the insects
3071,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"they feed upon. They go to sleep, like the dormouse, in the winter,"
3072,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,but they do not make a burrow; they cover themselves with earth by
3073,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,scraping it up and throwing it over their bodies. In doing this they
3074,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,would find their heads and tails very much in the way if it were not
3075,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"that they are able to draw them in between their shells. No one, of"
3076,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"course, knows how they find their way out again in the spring; but it"
3077,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,is supposed that they scratch the earth away and throw it underneath
3078,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"them, at the same time pushing their way up."
3079,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,
3080,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,Tortoises live to a very great age. One was given to the Zoological
3081,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"Gardens in 1833 which had already lived seventy years in Port Louis,"
3082,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"in the island of Mauritius. Its shell, from the head to the tail,"
3083,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,"measured four feet four inches and a half, and it weighed two hundred"
3084,THE ANIMAL IN ARMOR.,and eighty-five pounds.

3093,THE IRON RING.,THE IRON RING.
3094,THE IRON RING.,
3095,THE IRON RING.,
3096,THE IRON RING.,"Chang Wang was a Chinaman, and was reputed to be one of the shrewdest"
3097,THE IRON RING.,dealers in the Flowery Land. If making money fast be the test of
3098,THE IRON RING.,"cleverness, there was not a merchant in the province of Kwang Tung who"
3099,THE IRON RING.,had earned a better right to be called clever. Who owned so many
3100,THE IRON RING.,"fields of the tea-plant, who shipped so many bales of its leaves to"
3101,THE IRON RING.,"the little island in the west, as did Chang Wang? It was whispered,"
3102,THE IRON RING.,"indeed, that many of the bales contained green tea made by chopping up"
3103,THE IRON RING.,"spoiled black tea leaves, and coloring them with copper--a process"
3104,THE IRON RING.,likely to turn them into a mild kind of poison; but if the unwholesome
3105,THE IRON RING.,"trash found purchasers, Chang Wang never troubled himself with the"
3106,THE IRON RING.,thought whether any one might suffer in health from drinking his tea.
3107,THE IRON RING.,"So long as the dealer made money, he was content; and plenty of money"
3108,THE IRON RING.,he made.
3109,THE IRON RING.,
3110,THE IRON RING.,But knowing how to make money is quite a different thing from knowing
3111,THE IRON RING.,"how to enjoy it. With all his ill-gotten gains, Chang Wang was a"
3112,THE IRON RING.,"miserable man; for he had no heart to spend his silver pieces, even on"
3113,THE IRON RING.,his own comfort. The rich dealer lived in a hut which one of his own
3114,THE IRON RING.,laborers might have despised; he dressed as a poor Tartar shepherd
3115,THE IRON RING.,might have dressed when driving his flock. Chang Wang grudged himself
3116,THE IRON RING.,"even a hat to keep off the rays of the sun. Men laughed, and said that"
3117,THE IRON RING.,"he would have cut off his own pigtail of plaited hair, if he could"
3118,THE IRON RING.,have sold it for the price of a dinner!
3119,THE IRON RING.,
3120,THE IRON RING.,"Chang Wang was, in fact, a miser, and was rather proud than ashamed of"
3121,THE IRON RING.,the hateful vice of avarice.
3122,THE IRON RING.,
3123,THE IRON RING.,"Chang Wang had to make a journey to Macao, down the great River"
3124,THE IRON RING.,"Yang-se-kiang, for purposes of trade. The question with the Chinaman"
3125,THE IRON RING.,"now was, in what way he should travel."
3126,THE IRON RING.,
3127,THE IRON RING.,"""Shall I hire a palanquin?"" thought Chang Wang, stroking his thin"
3128,THE IRON RING.,"mustaches; ""no, a palanquin would cost too much money. Shall I take my"
3129,THE IRON RING.,"passage in a trading vessel?"""
3130,THE IRON RING.,
3131,THE IRON RING.,"The rich trader shook his head, and the pigtail behind it--such a"
3132,THE IRON RING.,passage would have to be paid for.
3133,THE IRON RING.,
3134,THE IRON RING.,"""I know what I'll do,"" said the miser to himself; ""I'll ask my uncle"
3135,THE IRON RING.,Fing Fang to take me in his fishing-boat down the great river. It is
3136,THE IRON RING.,true that it will make my journey a long one; but then I shall make it
3137,THE IRON RING.,"for nothing. I'll go to the fisherman Fing Fang, and settle the matter"
3138,THE IRON RING.,"at once."""
3139,THE IRON RING.,
3140,THE IRON RING.,"The business was soon arranged, for Fing Fang would not refuse his"
3141,THE IRON RING.,"rich nephew a seat in his boat. But he, like every one else, was"
3142,THE IRON RING.,disgusted at Chang Wang's meanness; and as soon as the dealer had left
3143,THE IRON RING.,"his hovel, thus spoke Fing Fang to his sons, Ko and Jung:--"
3144,THE IRON RING.,
3145,THE IRON RING.,"""Here's a fellow who has scraped up money enough to build a second"
3146,THE IRON RING.,"Porcelain Tower, and he comes here to beg a free passage in a"
3147,THE IRON RING.,fishing-boat from an uncle whom he has never so much as asked to share
3148,THE IRON RING.,"a dish of his birds'-nests soup!"""
3149,THE IRON RING.,
3150,THE IRON RING.,"""Birds'-nests soup, indeed!"" exclaimed Ko; ""why, Chang Wang never"
3151,THE IRON RING.,"indulges in luxuries such as that. If dogs' flesh were not so cheap,"
3152,THE IRON RING.,"he'd grudge himself the paw of a roasted puppy!"""
3153,THE IRON RING.,
3154,THE IRON RING.,"""And what will Chang Wang make of all his money at last?"" said Fing"
3155,THE IRON RING.,"Fang, more gravely; ""he cannot carry it away with him when he dies."""
3156,THE IRON RING.,
3157,THE IRON RING.,"""O, he's gathering it up for some one who will know how to spend it!"""
3158,THE IRON RING.,"laughed Jung. ""Chang Wang is merely fishing for others; what he"
3159,THE IRON RING.,"gathers, they will enjoy."""
3160,THE IRON RING.,
3161,THE IRON RING.,"It was a bright, pleasant day when Chang Wang stepped into the boat of"
3162,THE IRON RING.,"his uncle, to drop slowly down the great Yang-se-kiang. Many a civil"
3163,THE IRON RING.,"word he said to Fing Fang and his sons, for civil words cost nothing."
3164,THE IRON RING.,"Chang Wang sat in the boat, twisting the ends of his long mustaches,"
3165,THE IRON RING.,and thinking how much money each row of plants in his tea-fields might
3166,THE IRON RING.,"bring him. Presently, having finished his calculations, the miser"
3167,THE IRON RING.,"turned to watch his relations, who were pursuing their fishing"
3168,THE IRON RING.,"occupation in the way peculiar to China. Instead of rods, lines, or"
3169,THE IRON RING.,"nets, the Fing Fang family was provided with trained cormorants, which"
3170,THE IRON RING.,"are a kind of bird with a long neck, large appetite, and a particular"
3171,THE IRON RING.,fancy for fish.
3172,THE IRON RING.,
3173,THE IRON RING.,"It was curious to watch a bird diving down in the sunny water, and"
3174,THE IRON RING.,then suddenly come up again with a struggling fish in his bill. The
3175,THE IRON RING.,"fish was, however, always taken away from the cormorant, and thrown by"
3176,THE IRON RING.,one of the Fing Fangs into a well at the bottom of the boat.
3177,THE IRON RING.,
3178,THE IRON RING.,"""Cousin Ko,"" said the miser, leaning forward to speak, ""how is it that"
3179,THE IRON RING.,"your clever cormorants never devour the fish they catch?"""
3180,THE IRON RING.,
3181,THE IRON RING.,"""Cousin Chang Wang,"" replied the young man, ""dost thou not see that"
3182,THE IRON RING.,"each bird has an iron ring round his neck, so that he cannot swallow?"
3183,THE IRON RING.,"He only fishes for others."""
3184,THE IRON RING.,
3185,THE IRON RING.,"""Methinks the cormorant has a hard life of it,"" observed the miser,"
3186,THE IRON RING.,"smiling. ""He must wish his iron ring at the bottom of the"
3187,THE IRON RING.,"Yang-se-kiang."""
3188,THE IRON RING.,
3189,THE IRON RING.,"Fing Fang, who had just let loose two young cormorants from the boat,"
3190,THE IRON RING.,"turned round, and from his narrow slits of Chinese eyes looked keenly"
3191,THE IRON RING.,upon his nephew.
3192,THE IRON RING.,
3193,THE IRON RING.,"""Didst thou ever hear of a creature,"" said he, ""that puts an iron ring"
3194,THE IRON RING.,"around his own neck?"""
3195,THE IRON RING.,
3196,THE IRON RING.,"""There is no such creature in all the land that the Great Wall"
3197,THE IRON RING.,"borders,"" replied Chang Wang."
3198,THE IRON RING.,
3199,THE IRON RING.,Fing Fang solemnly shook the pigtail which hung down his back. Like
3200,THE IRON RING.,"many of the Chinese, he had read a great deal, and was a kind of"
3201,THE IRON RING.,philosopher in his way.
3202,THE IRON RING.,
3203,THE IRON RING.,"""Nephew Chang Wang,"" he observed, ""_I_ know of a creature (and he is"
3204,THE IRON RING.,not far off at this moment) who is always fishing for gain--constantly
3205,THE IRON RING.,"catching, but never enjoying. Avarice--the love of hoarding--is the"
3206,THE IRON RING.,"iron ring round his neck; and so long as it stays there, he is much"
3207,THE IRON RING.,"like one of our trained cormorants--he may be clever, active,"
3208,THE IRON RING.,"successful, but he is only fishing for others."""
3209,THE IRON RING.,
3210,THE IRON RING.,I leave my readers to guess whether the sharp dealer understood his
3211,THE IRON RING.,"uncle's meaning, or whether Chang Wang resolved in future not only to"
3212,THE IRON RING.,"catch, but to enjoy. Fing Fang's moral might be good enough for a"
3213,THE IRON RING.,"heathen, but it does not go nearly far enough for a Christian. If a"
3214,THE IRON RING.,"miser is like a cormorant with an iron ring round his neck, the man or"
3215,THE IRON RING.,"the child who lives for his own pleasure only, what is he but a greedy"
3216,THE IRON RING.,cormorant with the iron ring? Who would wish to resemble a cormorant
3217,THE IRON RING.,at all? The bird knows the enjoyment of _getting_; let us prize the
3218,THE IRON RING.,"richer enjoyment of _giving_. Let me close with an English proverb,"
3219,THE IRON RING.,"which I prefer to the Chinaman's parable--""Charity is the truest"
3220,THE IRON RING.,"epicure, for she eats with many mouths."""

3261,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Oh how cold and miserable everything is! Hardly a thought to be
3262,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,uppermost on Christmas eve in the mind of a little school-boy; and yet
3263,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,it was that which filled the mind of Charlie Earle on the Christmas
3264,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"eve of which I am going to tell you. Only a few hours before, he had"
3265,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"been as happy as any boy could be. Everybody was going home, and"
3266,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,everybody was in the highest spirits and full of the most delightful
3267,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,hopes of what the holidays would bring them; and now everybody except
3268,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Charlie has gone home, and he is left alone in the dreary school-room,"
3269,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"knowing that at any rate Christmas day, and maybe many other days, are"
3270,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"to be spent away from home, and from all the pleasant doings which he"
3271,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,had pictured to himself and others only the very day before.
3272,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3273,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,The coming of the post-bag had been scarcely noticed in the
3274,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"school-room that morning. So when old Bunce, the butler, looked in at"
3275,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"the door and said, ""Master Earle is wanted in the doctor's room,"" the"
3276,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"boys all wondered, and Charlie's neighbor whispered to him, ""Whatever"
3277,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"can he want you for, Earle?"" The doctor's tale was soon told, and it"
3278,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,was one which sent Charlie back to the school-room with a very
3279,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,different face to the one with which he had left it. A letter had come
3280,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"to Doctor West from Charlie's father, and in it a note from his mother"
3281,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"to Charlie himself, written the night before, and saying that a"
3282,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,summons had come that very morning calling them to Charlie's
3283,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"grandmother, who was very ill, and that they were starting for"
3284,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Scotland that night and would be almost at their journey's end when
3285,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Charlie got the news. The note said that Laura, Charlie's sister,"
3286,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"would go with them, but that they could not wait for Charlie himself,"
3287,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"so they had written to Mrs. Lamb, Charlie's old nurse, who lived about"
3288,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"ten miles from Dr. West's, and had asked her to take charge of him for"
3289,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"a day or two, till more was known of his grandmother's state and some"
3290,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,better plan could be made for him. It was sad enough for Charlie to
3291,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,hear of the illness of his kind old grandmother--sad enough to see the
3292,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"merry start of the other boys, while he had to stay behind; but to"
3293,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"have to think of Christmas day spent away from father and mother, away"
3294,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"from Laura and home, was excuse enough for a few bitter tears. But"
3295,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"unpleasant things come to an end as well as pleasant ones, and"
3296,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Charlie's lonely waiting in the school-room came to its end, and he"
3297,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"found himself that afternoon snugly packed into the Blackridge coach,"
3298,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,and forgetting his own troubles in listening to the cheery chatter of
3299,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"the other passengers, and in looking at what was to be seen as the"
3300,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,coach rolled briskly along the snow-covered road. It was quite dark
3301,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"when they reached Blackridge, and Charlie looked out at the people"
3302,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"gathered round the door of the ""Packhorse Inn,"" and a sudden fear"
3303,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,filled his mind lest there should be no one there to meet him; but he
3304,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"soon saw by the light at the inn door Nurse Lamb herself, with her"
3305,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,kind face looking so beaming that it seemed a little bit like _really_
3306,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,going home.
3307,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3308,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"""Here, father,"" said Nurse Lamb to her jolly-looking husband; ""here's"
3309,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Master Charlie, safe and sound! You bring the luggage in the barrow"
3310,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"while I take him home quick, for I am sure he must be cold."""
3311,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3312,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"And so nurse bustled Charlie off down a lane and across a meadow, till"
3313,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"they came to a wicket-gate, beyond which stood the back of a low,"
3314,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,deep-thatched cottage half buried in snow. On getting round to the
3315,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"front the door was opened by a little girl, and nurse called out,"
3316,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"""Here, Molly, here we are;"" adding, ""Molly is my step-daughter, Master"
3317,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Charlie--the one I used to tell you about before I was married, when"
3318,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"we were down at Hastings."""
3319,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3320,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,[Illustration: WINTER.]
3321,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3322,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"When they got into the house, there was the kitchen with its rows of"
3323,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"bright pewter plates, its wide hearth and roaring fire, its hams"
3324,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"hanging to the beams, all just as they had been described in the days"
3325,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,when nurse's new home at Blackridge Farm was a subject of never-ending
3326,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,interest to the two children in Mrs. Earle's nursery.
3327,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3328,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"After he had had a capital tea, Charlie was allowed to go round with"
3329,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"the farmer to see that the horses were all right for the night,"
3330,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Charlie carrying the lantern and feeling himself quite a man as he
3331,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,followed the farmer into the stable. There was much coming and going
3332,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"at the farm that evening, for was it not Christmas eve? and nurse was"
3333,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,busy sending off gifts to neighbors who were not so thriving as
3334,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"herself, and busy, too, in making preparations for the morrow. Charlie"
3335,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"meanwhile sat in the settle and made friends with Molly, who was about"
3336,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"his own age and knew much more, though she was only a girl, about dogs"
3337,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,and rabbits and tadpoles than London-bred Charlie. By and by they
3338,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"helped to stir the great plum-pudding, and dressed the kitchen and"
3339,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"parlor with evergreens, till nurse called them to come and hear the"
3340,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,chimes.
3341,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3342,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,And Charlie thought it very beautiful as he stood at the door and
3343,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,listened to the bells. And as they stood there the wind wafted to them
3344,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,also the voices of the choir as they went on their round through the
3345,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"village, singing their carols; and then Charlie went to bed with"
3346,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"""Hark, the herald angels sing!"" ringing in his ears."
3347,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3348,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Next morning Charlie, as he ran down stairs, could hardly believe this"
3349,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"was really Christmas day, all was so unlike any Christmas he had known"
3350,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,before; but in the kitchen he found one thing like the Christmas
3351,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"mornings at home, for he found quite a little pile of parcels beside"
3352,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"his plate, containing the pretty gifts prepared by father and mother"
3353,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"and Laura, and sent by them to nurse, so that at any rate the little"
3354,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,lad should not be robbed of this part of his Christmas pleasures.
3355,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"There was a note, too, from mother, saying that she and father and"
3356,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Laura were safe in Edinburgh, and that grandmother was better, and"
3357,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,that she hoped to tell him in her next letter when they and he should
3358,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,meet at home in London. Such a bright beginning was enough to make all
3359,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,the rest of the day bright; and bright it was. Charlie found plenty to
3360,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"do till church-time, as Molly showed him all the nooks and corners"
3361,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,about the farm.
3362,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3363,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"The old church, with its high pews and country congregation made"
3364,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Charlie feel that he must be dreaming. Surely it could not be
3365,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas, but must be the autumn? and he and Laura and everybody had"
3366,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,come away from London for the holidays?
3367,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3368,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"No; it was no dream. It was really Christmas; for there, round the"
3369,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"pillars, were the holly-wreaths with their red berries, and there,"
3370,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"behind the chancel-screen, were the same Christmas texts as in their"
3371,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"church in London. When service was over, Charlie and Molly hurried"
3372,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"home to help Martha, the farm-girl, to have all in readiness for the"
3373,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Christmas dinner. But after dinner there was not much sitting
3374,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,still--at any rate for Charlie; for who could think of sitting still
3375,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"indoors, when outside there were a pond covered with ice and a"
3376,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,farmyard full of horses and dogs?
3377,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3378,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Nor was the evening after tea without its pleasure. When the snow
3379,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"began to fall, and the doors and windows were tightly closed, then a"
3380,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,huge log was piled on the fire; and while Farmer and Mrs. Lamb sat and
3381,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"talked before it in the parlor, Charlie and Molly had a fine game of"
3382,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,romps in the big kitchen with Martha; and when they were tired of
3383,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"that, they sat on the hearth and roasted chestnuts, while nurse read a"
3384,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,Christmas tale to them.
3385,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,
3386,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"And here I must leave Charlie finishing his Christmas day, hoping that"
3387,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"any who read this story of it may agree with Charlie in thinking, when"
3388,CHARLIE'S CHRISTMAS.,"he laid his head on the pillow that night, that, though it had been"

3399,MARCELLIN.,"Marcellin, a young shepherd boy, who tended his father's flock upon"
3400,MARCELLIN.,"the mountains, having penetrated a deep gorge to search for one of his"
3401,MARCELLIN.,"sheep which was missing, discovered in the thickest of the forest a"
3402,MARCELLIN.,"man lying upon the ground overcome with fatigue, and faint from want"
3403,MARCELLIN.,of food.
3404,MARCELLIN.,
3405,MARCELLIN.,"""My poor lad,"" said the man, ""I am dying from hunger and thirst. Two"
3406,MARCELLIN.,"days ago I came upon this mountain to hunt. I lost my way, and I have"
3407,MARCELLIN.,"passed two nights in the woods."""
3408,MARCELLIN.,
3409,MARCELLIN.,"Marcellin drew some bread and cheese from his knapsack, and gave to"
3410,MARCELLIN.,the stranger.
3411,MARCELLIN.,
3412,MARCELLIN.,"""Eat,"" he said, ""and then follow me. I will conduct you to an old oak"
3413,MARCELLIN.,"tree, in the trunk of which we shall find some water."""
3414,MARCELLIN.,
3415,MARCELLIN.,"The food satisfied his hunger; then he followed Marcellin, and drank"
3416,MARCELLIN.,"of the water, which he found excellent. Afterwards the boy conducted"
3417,MARCELLIN.,"him down the mountain, and pointed out the way to the city."
3418,MARCELLIN.,
3419,MARCELLIN.,"Then the hunter said to the shepherd boy, ""My good lad, you have saved"
3420,MARCELLIN.,"my life. If I had remained in the mountain another night, I should"
3421,MARCELLIN.,have died. I will show you my gratitude. Come with me to the city. I
3422,MARCELLIN.,"am rich; and I will treat you as if you were my own son."""
3423,MARCELLIN.,
3424,MARCELLIN.,"""No, sir,"" said Marcellin; ""I cannot go with you to the city. I have a"
3425,MARCELLIN.,"father and a mother who are poor, but whom I love with all my heart."
3426,MARCELLIN.,"Were you a king, I would not leave my parents."""
3427,MARCELLIN.,
3428,MARCELLIN.,"""But,"" said the hunter, ""you live here in a miserable cabin with an"
3429,MARCELLIN.,"ugly thatched roof; I live in a palace built of marble, and"
3430,MARCELLIN.,surrounded with statues. I will give you drink in glasses like
3431,MARCELLIN.,"crystal, and food upon plates of silver."""
3432,MARCELLIN.,
3433,MARCELLIN.,"""Very likely,"" responded Marcellin; ""but our house is not half as"
3434,MARCELLIN.,"miserable as you suppose. If it is not surrounded with statues, it is"
3435,MARCELLIN.,among fruit trees and trellised vines. We drink water which we get
3436,MARCELLIN.,"from a neighboring fountain. It is very clear, though we do not drink"
3437,MARCELLIN.,"from crystal cups. We gain by our labor a modest living, but good"
3438,MARCELLIN.,"enough. And if we do not have silver ware in our house, we have plenty"
3439,MARCELLIN.,"of flowers."""
3440,MARCELLIN.,
3441,MARCELLIN.,"""Nonsense, my boy! Come with me,"" said the hunter; ""we have trees and"
3442,MARCELLIN.,flowers in the city more beautiful than yours. I have magnificent
3443,MARCELLIN.,"grounds, with broad alleys, with a flower garden filled with the most"
3444,MARCELLIN.,"precious plants. In the middle of it there is a beautiful fountain,"
3445,MARCELLIN.,the like of which you never saw. The water is thrown upward in small
3446,MARCELLIN.,"streams, and falls back sparkling into the great white marble basin."
3447,MARCELLIN.,"You would be quite happy to live there."""
3448,MARCELLIN.,
3449,MARCELLIN.,"""But I am quite happy _here_,"" replied Marcellin. ""The shade of our"
3450,MARCELLIN.,forests is at least as delicious as that of your superb alleys. Our
3451,MARCELLIN.,fields are running over with flowers. You can hardly step without
3452,MARCELLIN.,finding them under your feet. There are flowers around our
3453,MARCELLIN.,"cottage--roses, violets, lilies, pansies. Do you suppose that our"
3454,MARCELLIN.,fountains are less beautiful than your little jets of water? You
3455,MARCELLIN.,"should see the merry brooks bounding down over the rocks, and running"
3456,MARCELLIN.,"away through the flowery meadow."""
3457,MARCELLIN.,
3458,MARCELLIN.,"""You don't know what you refuse,"" rejoined the hunter. ""If you go into"
3459,MARCELLIN.,"the city, you will be put to school, where you can study all"
3460,MARCELLIN.,"departments of art and science. There are theatres, where skilful"
3461,MARCELLIN.,"musicians will enchant your ears by harmony. There are rich saloons,"
3462,MARCELLIN.,"to which you will be admitted, to enjoy splendid fêtes. And since you"
3463,MARCELLIN.,"so much love the country, you shall pass your summer vacation with me"
3464,MARCELLIN.,"in a superb chateau which I possess."""
3465,MARCELLIN.,
3466,MARCELLIN.,"""Well, I am greatly obliged to you,"" replied the shepherd boy; ""but I"
3467,MARCELLIN.,think I had better stop with father and mother. I can learn everything
3468,MARCELLIN.,"useful in our village school. I am taught to fear God, to honor my"
3469,MARCELLIN.,"parents, and to imitate their virtues. I don't wish to learn anything"
3470,MARCELLIN.,"beyond that. Then your musicians, which you tell about, do they sing"
3471,MARCELLIN.,any better than the nightingale or the golden robin? Then we have our
3472,MARCELLIN.,concerts and our fêtes. We are right down happy when we are all
3473,MARCELLIN.,"together on Sunday evening under the trees. My sister sings, while I"
3474,MARCELLIN.,"accompany her upon my flute. Our chants can be heard a long way off,"
3475,MARCELLIN.,"and echo repeats them. And in the evening, when we stay in the house,"
3476,MARCELLIN.,"grandfather is with us. We love him so much because he is so good. No,"
3477,MARCELLIN.,"I will not leave my parents. I will not renounce their home, if it is"
3478,MARCELLIN.,"humble. I cannot go to the city with you."""
3479,MARCELLIN.,
3480,MARCELLIN.,"The hunter saw that it was of no use to argue the point; so he said,--"
3481,MARCELLIN.,
3482,MARCELLIN.,"""What shall I give you, then, to express my gratitude for your"
3483,MARCELLIN.,"services? Take this purse, filled with gold."""
3484,MARCELLIN.,
3485,MARCELLIN.,"""What need have I of it? We are poor, but we want nothing. Besides, if"
3486,MARCELLIN.,"I accept your money, I should _sell_ the little service I have been"
3487,MARCELLIN.,able to render. That would be wrong; my mother would blame me for such
3488,MARCELLIN.,conduct. She tells me that we ought always to assist those who are in
3489,MARCELLIN.,"trouble and want without expecting pay for it."""
3490,MARCELLIN.,
3491,MARCELLIN.,"""Generous boy! What shall I give you as a mark of my gratitude? You"
3492,MARCELLIN.,"must accept something, or I shall be greatly disappointed."""
3493,MARCELLIN.,
3494,MARCELLIN.,"""Is it so?"" asked Marcellin, playfully. ""Then give me the cup which"
3495,MARCELLIN.,is suspended at your side--that one on which is engraved a picture of
3496,MARCELLIN.,"some dogs pursuing a stag."""
3497,MARCELLIN.,
3498,MARCELLIN.,"The hunter joyfully gave the cup to the happy shepherd boy, who,"
3499,MARCELLIN.,"having once more indicated the way which would lead to the city, bade"
3500,MARCELLIN.,"him good day, and went back to his flock."
3501,MARCELLIN.,
3502,MARCELLIN.,"And the rich man returned to his splendid dwelling, having learned"
3503,MARCELLIN.,"that it is the proper use of the means we have, rather than wishing"
3504,MARCELLIN.,"for greater, which brings happiness and contentment."

3515,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The scene represents a solitude, very rugged and sublime--mountains"

3517,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,dark clouds in the sky a few straggling sunbeams find their way to the
3518,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,valley. Upon the border of an immense cliff stands a group of men
3519,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,whose costume denotes them to be brigands of the Apennines. Upon the
3520,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"very edge of the precipice, erect and calm, is a young man, surrounded"
3521,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"by the brigands, who are preparing to throw him into the depths below."
3522,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The chief is a short distance away, and seemingly about to give the"

3524,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"beauty, waving her hand menacingly towards the chief as if commanding"
3525,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"that the young man's life be spared. Her manner, resolute and"
3526,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"imperious, the countenance of the chief, the grateful calmness of the"

3531,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"This picture, as will be readily guessed, is the work of SALVATOR"
3532,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"ROSA. Born at Arenella, near Naples, in 1615, of poor parents, he was"
3533,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"so admirably endowed by nature that, even in his boyhood, he became a"
3534,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"spirited painter, a good musician, and an excellent poet. But his"
3535,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,tastes led him to give his attention to painting.
3536,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3537,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Unfortunately, some severe satires which he published in Naples made"
3538,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"him many enemies in that city, and he was obliged to fly to Rome,"
3539,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,where he took a position at once as a painter. Leaving that city after
3540,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"a while, he went to Florence, and there found a generous encouragement"

3543,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3544,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,The environs of Florence afforded him superior advantages in
3545,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"developing his genius. The Apennines, with their dark gorges, their"
3546,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"picturesque landscapes, and their snow-clad peaks, pleased his wild"
3547,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,imagination. In their vast recesses he found his best inspirations and
3548,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,his most original subjects. Often he wandered for days over the abrupt
3549,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"mountains, infested with bandits, to find work for his ambitious"

3551,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3552,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,One day he had advanced farther than usual into the profound and

3556,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"watching him with great curiosity. A large hat, with stained and torn"
3557,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"brim, covered his sun-burnt visage; a leather belt bound his dark sack"
3558,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"to his body, and gave support to a pistol and hunting-knife,"
3559,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"invariably carried by the brigands of the mountains. His black beard,"
3560,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"thick and untidy, concealed a portion of his face; but there could be"
3561,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,no doubt that his dark glance was fixed upon the stranger who came to

3564,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"For almost any other but our hero, the sudden apparition of that wild"

3606,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The leader of these brigands was a man about forty years of age, named"
3607,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Pietratesta. His great physical strength, his courage, and, more than"
3608,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"all the rest, his energy, had made him a favorite among his"
3609,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"companions, and given him authority over them. Famous among the"

3612,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"for years to a life of adventure, pillage, and murder, he treated his"
3613,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,prisoners without pity or mercy. All who were unable to purchase their
3614,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"liberty by paying whatever ransom he fixed, were put to death. He"
3615,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"looked upon civilized people not as men, but as prizes."

3649,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3650,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"As the chief uttered these words, he walked away, leaving Salvator in"

3652,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3653,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"During the short conversation two children came from one of the tents,"
3654,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"being attracted by the noise. Their little blond heads, curiously"
3655,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"turned towards the captive, their faces, tanned by the sun, but"
3656,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"animated by the crimson of health and youth, and their picturesque"
3657,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,costume had attracted the attention of the painter. When the chief had
3658,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"gone away, he approached them, and smiled. The children drew away"
3659,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"abashed; then, reassured by the air of goodness which the young man"

3662,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Are you going to live with us?"" said the eldest, who was about eight"

3684,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3685,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Attracted by the call of the child, a lady came out of the principal"
3686,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"tent. She was yet young, tall, and covered with a medley of garments"
3687,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"from various costumes. Her face sparkled with energy, and might have"
3688,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"been called beautiful. She threw a sad glance at Salvator, and"
3689,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"approached him haughtily, as if to give an order. But seeing the two"
3690,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"children busily looking over the sketch-book, and observing the"
3691,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"familiar way with which both treated their new acquaintance, she"
3692,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"appeared to change her manner somewhat, and began to look at the"
3693,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"pictures herself, and to admire them. At the end of half an hour the"
3694,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,mother and the children seemed like old friends of Salvator Rosa.
3695,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3696,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,The woman was the wife of the chief. A daughter of an honorable
3697,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"family, she married a young man at Pisa, her native city, who proved"
3698,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,to be captain of this band of robbers. She could not well leave the
3699,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"company into which she had been betrayed; and so, with a noble"
3700,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"self-denial, she became resigned to her hard lot. An unwilling witness"
3701,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"of the many crimes of her husband and his companions, she suffered"
3702,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"cruelly in her resignation. Yet her fidelity, her virtue,--things"
3703,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"rarely known, but sometimes respected among these mountain"
3704,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"brigands,--had given her a moral power over the men as well as over"
3705,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,her husband. More than once she had used this means to temper their
3706,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"ferocity, and obtain pardon for their unfortunate prisoners."
3707,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3708,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,Just then one of the brigands came and brought to the prisoner the
3709,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,order from the chief that he should write to his friends to obtain
3710,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"money for his ransom. The man was going, under a disguise, to the city"
3711,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,of Florence; and he offered to deliver any letters intrusted to his
3712,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,care. He indicated the place where the ten thousand ducats must be
3713,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"left, so that Salvator might inform his correspondent."
3714,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3715,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,Our hero had many devoted friends; but nearly all were artists like
3716,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"himself, and without fortune. Nevertheless, he decided to write to one"
3717,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,of them. He gave orders that all the pictures in his studio should be
3718,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"sold. He hoped that the money which they would bring, together with"
3719,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"what his friends could advance to him, would amount to the sum"
3720,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,demanded by the chief.
3721,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3722,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"This done, Salvator easily persuaded himself that he should soon be"
3723,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"set at liberty, and the artist recovered his unconcern, and almost his"
3724,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,usual good spirits. The country around him was full of romantic
3725,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"studies for his pencil. He had, besides, found in the society of the"
3726,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,children of Pietratesta two charming companions. He instructed them in
3727,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"the elements of his art; and his pupils, to both of whom the study was"
3728,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"quite new, seemed never to grow tired of their task."
3729,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3730,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"In a moment of good humor, he drew caricatures of each member of the"
3731,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"band, which created a great deal of amusement. Then he drew, with"
3732,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"great care, the portraits of the two children. This attention"
3733,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"profoundly touched the heart of the mother, and her tender sympathy,"
3734,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"almost wasting among these unfeeling men, found a secret pleasure in"
3735,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,rendering the captivity of the young painter less unhappy and less
3736,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"hard. She conversed with him familiarly, and it gave her great"
3737,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,pleasure to see the care which he took to instruct her children.
3738,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3739,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"So Salvator Rosa, to whom the band gave quite a considerable degree of"
3740,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"liberty, never dreamed of taking improper advantage of it. Thanks to"
3741,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"his fancy and his recklessness as an artist, he almost forgot that he"
3742,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"was the prisoner of a cruel master, and that his life was in peril."
3743,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3744,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"But the ransom, which he had sent for, came not. Whether the letters"
3745,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"he had written failed to reach their destination, or whether his"
3746,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"friends were deaf to his request for assistance, he received no"
3747,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"answer. He wrote repeatedly, but always with the same result."
3748,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3749,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"And so the months slipped by, and the chief began to grow impatient at"
3750,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"the long delay. His wife had more than once calmed his anger, and"
3751,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"prevented any catastrophe. At length several weeks went by, in which"
3752,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,the expeditions of the band were unfruitful. The provisions were
3753,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"running low, and Pietratesta saw in his captive one unprofitable"
3754,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"mouth. Sivora, his wife, felt her influence to be growing weaker and"
3755,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,weaker under the increasing destitution and continued delay.
3756,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3757,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"One day Pietratesta encountered his prisoner, and, addressing him in"
3758,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"an irritated voice,--"
3759,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3760,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Well?"" he said, as if his question needed no other explanation."
3761,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3762,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Nothing yet,"" responded Salvator Rosa, sadly."
3763,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3764,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Ah, this is too much!"" cried the brigand. ""I begin to think you are"
3765,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,playing with me. But do you know the price Pietratesta makes those pay
3766,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"who cross him?"""
3767,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3768,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Alas! I am far from trying to deceive you. You know that I have done"
3769,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,all in my power to obtain my ransom. I have written to various
3770,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,persons; your own men have taken my letters. You see that it is not
3771,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"my fault."""
3772,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3773,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""It is always the fault of prisoners when their ransom is not paid."""
3774,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3775,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Wait a little longer. I will write again to-day."""
3776,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3777,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Wait! wait! A whole year, month after month, has gone by, and you"
3778,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,repeat the same old story. A year--an age for me--I have waited. Do
3779,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,you think I have been making unmeaning threats? Do you expect to abuse
3780,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"my patience with impunity? It has given out at last--the more so as,"""
3781,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"added he, now that he felt his anger increasing, ""I ought to have"
3782,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"settled this affair a long while ago. This is your last day, observe"
3783,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"me."""
3784,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3785,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"At a sign from their chief, four bandits seized the young man, and"
3786,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"bound him. As Salvator was led away, he cast one sad look at the"
3787,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"dwelling where he had passed many happy hours, and from which he was"
3788,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,going to his death. For a moment he stopped to say farewell to the
3789,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"children, who were standing at the door crying and stretching out"
3790,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,their little naked brown arms towards him.
3791,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3792,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"A few moments later, Sivora, who had been gathering flowers in the"
3793,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"mountains, returned home. Observing that her husband, as well as"
3794,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Salvator, was absent, and her children in tears, she guessed the"
3795,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,painful truth.
3796,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3797,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Where is Salvator?"" she asked of the eldest."
3798,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3799,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""They have bound him, and carried him away,"" responded the child,"
3800,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,still crying.
3801,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3802,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Which way?"""
3803,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3804,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Down yonder,"" was the reply of the child, pointing with its finger in"
3805,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,the direction of a rocky cliff already too well known for its horrible
3806,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,scenes.
3807,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3808,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Alas, wretched man!"" exclaimed Sivora, almost frantically, as she"
3809,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,comprehended the new crime her husband was about to commit. She sat
3810,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"down for a moment, covered her face with her hands--a prey to the"
3811,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"most unspeakable anxiety. Then, rising suddenly, her eyes flashing"
3812,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"with determination,--"
3813,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3814,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Come!"" she said, resolutely; ""come, my children. Perhaps we may yet"
3815,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"be in time."""
3816,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3817,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"And, taking the hands of her little ones, who followed her with"
3818,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"difficulty, but yet eagerly, she darted away at a rapid pace in the"
3819,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,direction taken by the brigands.
3820,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3821,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"While the men were hurrying Salvator along, the chief maintained a"
3822,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,profound silence. His band followed him as dumb as slaves who go to
3823,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"execute the will of their master, which they know is law. They soon"
3824,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"arrived at the summit of a cliff, which overhung a yawning abyss"
3825,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"beneath. After having taken one look over the precipice, and examined"
3826,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"the neighborhood rapidly, Pietratesta cried, ""Halt!"" and the whole"
3827,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,body came to a rest.
3828,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3829,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""There is just a quarter of an hour for you to live,"" he said, turning"
3830,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"to his prisoner. ""You have time to die like a Christian. Make your"

3832,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3833,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The young man hesitated for a moment, threw his agitated eyes around,"
3834,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"then, kneeling on the rock, he prayed earnestly. The men stood"
3835,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"unmoved, as if they had been statues cut from stone."
3836,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3837,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Salvator rose, with a calm demeanor, and said, addressing the chief in"
3838,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"a firm tone,--"
3839,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3840,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""My life is in your hands, I know. You are going to kill me without"
3841,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"any cause. I have prayed,"" he added, with a voice full of authority,"
3842,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""for the salvation of my soul, and repentance for thine. God will"
3843,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"judge us both. I am ready."""
3844,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3845,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Immediately the brigands seized the young man, and hurried him towards"
3846,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"the precipice. Already they waited but the signal of their chief,"
3847,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"already Pietratesta had given the fatal command, when a cry was heard"
3848,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"not many paces distant, which suspended the preparations."
3849,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3850,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Stop!"" exclaimed a harsh voice."
3851,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3852,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The bandits, astonished at the interruption, turned to see whence it"
3853,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"came. A woman ran towards them, her hair in disorder, her countenance"
3854,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"pale and agitated, her dark eyes flashing with determination. She held"
3855,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"by their hands two children, who, with weeping eyes, were hastening,"
3856,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"with all the speed their young limbs could carry them, towards the"
3857,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,precipice.
3858,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3859,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,It was Sivora.
3860,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3861,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,As she came forward the chief uttered an exclamation of disappointment
3862,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,and anger.
3863,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3864,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Why do you come here?"" he asked, in an irritated voice."
3865,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3866,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""You know well enough,"" responded Sivora, without any sign of"

3869,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"innocent, and that it is not his fault that the price of his ransom"
3870,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,has not been paid. Why commit a useless crime? You have too many on

3872,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"too late, let the young man go. His ransom is not absolutely"
3873,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"necessary. If it was, would his death bring it to you? Remember with"
3874,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,what care and solicitude he has treated your children! with what

3876,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"their hearts would break, at the wrong you would do their friend! It"
3877,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,is they--it is I--who ask clemency. You will not kill Salvator; you

3879,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3880,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,As she said these words she pushed the two little blond heads into the
3881,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,arms of their father.
3882,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3883,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"The brigands, hesitating, touched, without knowing why, struck with an"
3884,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"involuntary respect for the woman, remained immovable, with their eyes"
3885,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"fixed upon their chief, as if waiting to ascertain his wishes. He"
3886,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"stood, brooding, nervous, his eyes bent upon the ground, hardly daring"
3887,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"to look upon Sivora, at once his suppliant and accuser, a prey to"
3888,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"violent emotions. The authority of that respected voice, and the"
3889,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"irritation at being deprived of his revenge,--the invincible love he"
3890,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"had for the woman, and the shame of giving way before his men,--all"
3891,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"these warring considerations, the effects of which were plainly to be"
3892,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"seen on his swarthy face, spoke of the severe contest going on within."
3893,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3894,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,At length his evil genius got the control.
3895,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3896,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""What do I care for his solicitude and his tenderness?"" he said, in a"
3897,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"coarse voice. ""He would forget all as soon as he should get out of our"
3898,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"hands; and he would, no doubt, send the police after us if we should"
3899,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"let him go. I know what the promises of captives are worth. Besides,"
3900,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"_I_ command here, I alone, and I will be obeyed. Take away these"

3902,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3903,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Ah! is it so?"" exclaimed Sivora, in a piercing voice, throwing"
3904,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"herself before the bandits, who were pushing their victim towards the"
3905,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"chasm. ""Then I will beg no more; I _command_ now. Listen to me well,"
3906,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"for these are my last words. You know with what devotion, with what"
3907,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"resignation, I have supported this bitter life which you brought me to"
3908,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"among these mountains. The isolation, the sorrow, the shame, I have"
3909,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"endured for thee. I have never complained. I hoped, after such"
3910,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"sacrifices, you would at length listen to my words, and renounce your"
3911,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"bad life. But since you do not care for my devotion, since I am"
3912,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"nothing to you, listen well to my words, Pietratesta. If you dare to"
3913,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"commit this odious crime, look for a mother for your children, for,"
3914,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"with your victim, you will slay your wife!"""
3915,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3916,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"So saying, she advanced close to the brink of the cliff, over which"
3917,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,she could spring at the signal from her husband.
3918,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3919,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Salvator, motionless and rooted to the spot, in silence, full of"
3920,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"anxiety, observed this strange scene. The robbers, hardened by crime,"
3921,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"for the first time hesitated at the command of their chief, and fixed"
3922,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,their eyes upon the beautiful woman to whom despair added a new charm.
3923,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"They quailed before her authority, and stood as motionless as statues."
3924,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3925,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Pietratesta, overwhelmed by the recollections which the woman's words"
3926,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"awakened, alarmed at her threats and her resolution, hung his head,"
3927,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"like a guilty wretch before a just judge, while Sivora, with wild"
3928,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"countenance, piercing voice, and imperial manner, her long black hair"
3929,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"loosely falling upon her shoulders, with her arms extended towards the"
3930,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"abyss, almost resembled an ancient goddess, who suddenly appears at"
3931,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"the moment of crime, arrests the homicidal arm, and subjects the"
3932,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"criminal to punishment. There was in her figure an imposing grandeur,"
3933,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"before which the rude men, for an instant recalled to themselves, felt"
3934,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,humiliated and condemned.
3935,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3936,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Astounded by that firmness and devotion, ashamed of his violence"
3937,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"towards the woman who was living a life of outrage, the chief, after"
3938,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"some moments of moody silence, said, in an altered voice,--"
3939,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3940,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""You wish it! He is free!"""
3941,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,
3942,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Salvator threw himself upon his knees before his preserver, covered"
3943,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"her hand with kisses and tears, and pressed, with transport, the two"
3944,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"children in his arms. Completely wild with happiness and gratitude, he"
3945,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"abandoned himself to the buoyancy of his generous nature, when Sivora"
3946,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"said to him, in a whisper,--"

3948,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"""Go! go quickly! The tiger is only sleeping!"""
3949,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,

3954,AN ADVENTURE IN THE LIFE OF SALVATOR ROSA.,"Hardly had he entered Florence, yet sad from the recollection of the"

4106,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4107,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4108,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,It will be a real honest story--of how Christmas came to a poor cold
4109,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"home, and made it bright, and warm, and glad. A _very_ poor home it"
4110,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"was, up three flights of worm-eaten, dirt-stained stairs, in the old"
4111,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"gray house that stood far up a narrow, crooked alley, where the sun"
4112,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,never shone except just a while in the middle of the day. He tried
4113,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"hard to brighten up the place a little, but the tall houses all about"
4114,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,prevented him. Still he slanted a few golden beams even into that
4115,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,wretched home away up under the eaves; for though the few small panes
4116,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"of glass in the narrow windows had been mostly broken out, and their"
4117,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"places filled with boards nailed tight to keep out the wintry winds,"
4118,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and rain, and snow, still there were some left through which a feeble"
4119,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,ray did sometimes creep and make glad the hearts of the children. Five
4120,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,fatherless children lived with their mother in that old garret. Night
4121,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and day the mother sewed, taking scarcely any rest, and yet found it"
4122,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"hard to keep all the little toes and knees covered, and could get only"
4123,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"the poorest food for the five hungry mouths. The thought that, work"
4124,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"never so hard, she could not earn enough to give them one hearty,"
4125,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"satisfying meal, made her heart ache."
4126,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4127,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Three boys and two girls, in one old naked room, with only their"
4128,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"mother to care for them, and she so poor, that for years she had not"
4129,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"had a new gown, or a new bonnet! Yet she liked pretty new clothes, as"
4130,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"well as any one ever did, I know."
4131,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4132,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Of these five little folks, the oldest was Harry, the newsboy; then"
4133,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"came Katie, and Willie, and Fred, and, last of all, wee Jennie."
4134,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4135,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Though Harry was the oldest, yet _he_ was not very old. Just"
4136,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"twelve--a thin, white little fellow, with eyes that always looked as"
4137,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"if they wanted more. More what? Well, more sunshine; more warm"
4138,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"clothes, and bright, hot fires, and, O, very much more to eat!"
4139,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Sometimes he would make fifty cents in a day, selling newspapers, and"
4140,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"then he would hurry joyfully home, thinking of the hungry little"
4141,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,mouths it would help to fill. But some days he would hardly earn ten
4142,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"cents the whole long day. Then he would go slowly and sadly along,"
4143,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,wishing all sorts of things--that he could take home as much meat as
4144,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,he could carry to the little ones who had not eaten meat for so long
4145,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"they had almost forgotten how it tasted; or that the gentlemen, who"
4146,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"owned the clothing stores which he was passing, would say to him,"
4147,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Come in, my little fellow, and help yourself to as many warm clothes"
4148,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"as you want for yourself and your little brothers at home;"" or that he"
4149,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"could find a heap of money--and his mouth would water, thinking of the"
4150,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,good things which he could buy and take home with some of it.
4151,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4152,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,The other children always knew whether it had been a good or bad day
4153,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"with Harry, by the way he came up the stairs. If he came with a hop,"
4154,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"skip, and a jump, they knew it meant a good day; and a good day for"
4155,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,Harry was a good evening for them all.
4156,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4157,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Though Katie was really the name of the second child, she hardly ever"
4158,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"was called so; for her mother, and the children, and all the"
4159,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"neighbors, called her Sweetie, she was so good and so thoughtful for"
4160,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"others, so sweet-tempered and kind. She did everything so gently that"
4161,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,none of them could ever love her half as much as she deserved. Though
4162,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"only ten years old, and very small and pale, she did every bit of the"
4163,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"housework, and kept the ugly old room and its faded furniture so neat,"
4164,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,that it seemed almost home-like and pretty to them all. It was
4165,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,happiness enough for the little ones to get her first kiss when she
4166,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"came back from an errand, to sit by her at table, and, above all, to"
4167,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"lie closest to her at night. Willie, and Fred, and Jennie, all slept"
4168,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,with her on a straw bed in the corner; and they used to try to stretch
4169,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"her little arms over them all, so that even the one farthest off might"
4170,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"feel the tips of her fingers, so dearly did they love her."
4171,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4172,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"They had once owned more than one bedstead, and many other comfortable"
4173,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,things besides; but when their father was killed at the great factory
4174,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"where he worked, their mother was obliged to sell almost everything to"
4175,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"get enough money to pay for his funeral, and to help support her"
4176,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,little family; so that now she had only a narrow wooden settee for her
4177,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"bed, while Harry stretched himself on a couple of chairs, and the rest"
4178,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"slept all together in the bed on the floor. Poor as they were, they"
4179,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"were not very unhappy. Almost every night, when their mother took the"
4180,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"one dim candle all to herself, so that she could see to sew neatly,"
4181,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,Sweetie would amuse the other children by telling them beautiful
4182,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"stories about the little flower people, and the good fairies, and"
4183,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"about Kriss Kringle--though how she knew about him I can't tell, for"
4184,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,he never came down their chimney at Christmas.
4185,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4186,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""And, when my ship comes in,"" Sweetie used to say, ""I'll have the"
4187,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"tallest and handsomest Christmas tree, filled to the top with candies"
4188,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and toys, and lighted all over with different-colored candles, and"
4189,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"we'll sing and dance round it. Let's begin now, and get our voices in"
4190,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"tune."" Then they would all pipe up as loud as they could, and were as"
4191,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,happy as if they half believed Sweetie's ship was ready to land.
4192,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4193,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,But there came a hard year for poor needle-women: it was the year I am
4194,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"writing about, and Sweetie's mother found it almost impossible to get"
4195,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"even the necessaries of life. Her children's lips were bluer, their"
4196,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"faces more pinched, and thin, threadbare clothes more patched than"
4197,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"ever. Sweetie used to take the two boys, and hunt in the streets for"
4198,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"bits of coal and wood; but often, the very coldest days, they would"
4199,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"have no fire. It was very hard to bear, and especially for the poor"

4203,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,street lamps were lighted.
4204,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4205,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,The day before Christmas came. People were so busy cooking Christmas
4206,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"dainties that they did not stop to sift their cinders very carefully,"
4207,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,and Sweetie and the boys had picked up quite a large bag full of
4208,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"half-burnt coal in the alleys, and were carrying it home as carefully"
4209,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"as if it were a great treasure--as, indeed, it was to them. Being very"
4210,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"tired, they sat down to rest on the curbstone in front of an elegant"
4211,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,mansion. One of the long windows was open.
4212,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4213,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Let's get close up under the window,"" said Sweetie. ""I guess it's too"
4214,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"warm inside, and may be we shall get some of the heat. O! O! don't it"
4215,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"smell good?"" she cried, as the savory odors of the Christmas cooking"
4216,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,stole out upon the air.
4217,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4218,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""What is it, Sweetie?"" whispered Willie."
4219,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4220,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Coffee,"" said Sweetie, ""and turkeys, and jelly, perhaps."""
4221,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4222,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""I wish I had some,"" sighed Freddy, ""I'm so cold and hungry!"""
4223,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4224,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Poor little man! he must come and sit in Sweetie's lap; that will"
4225,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"make him warmer,"" said his sister, wrapping her shawl around him."
4226,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4227,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Yes; that's nice,"" said the little fellow, hugging her tight."
4228,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4229,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Mr. Rogers, the owner of this fine house, had lost his wife and two"
4230,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"dear children within the year. He lived here alone, with his servants,"
4231,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and was very desolate. When the children stopped under his window, he"
4232,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"was lying on a velvet sofa near it, and, lifting himself up, he peeped"
4233,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,out from behind the curtains just as Fred crept into his sister's
4234,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,arms; and he heard all they said.
4235,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4236,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""When your ship comes in, Sweetie, will it have turkeys and jellies in"
4237,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"it?"" said Willie, leaning against her."
4238,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4239,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Yes, indeed,"" said Sweetie. ""There will be turkeys almost as big as"
4240,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Jennie, and a great deal fatter."""
4241,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4242,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""But it's so long coming, Sweetie; you tell us every time it _will_"
4243,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"come, and it never _comes_ at all."""
4244,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4245,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""O, no, Freddy. I don't ever say it _will_ come, but it's nice to"
4246,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"think what we would do if it should come--isn't it?"""
4247,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4248,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""We'd buy a great white house, like this--wouldn't we, Sweetie?"""
4249,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4250,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""No, Willie. I'd rather buy that nice little store over by the church,"
4251,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"that's been shut up so long, and has FOR SALE on the door. I'd furnish"
4252,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"it all nice, and fill the shelves with beautiful goods, and trimmings"
4253,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"for ladies' dresses, and lovely toys. It shows so far that everybody"
4254,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,would be sure to buy their Christmas things there. It's just the
4255,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"dearest little place, with two cosy rooms back of the shop, and three"
4256,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"overhead; and I'd put flour and sugar, and tea and coffee, and all"
4257,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"sorts of goodies, in the kitchen cupboard, and new clothes for all of"
4258,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"us in the closets up stairs. Then I'd kindle a fire, and light the"
4259,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"lamps, and lock the door, and go back to the dreary old garret once"
4260,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"more--poor mother would be sitting there, sad and sober, as she"
4261,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"always is now, and I would say to her, 'Come, mother, before you light"
4262,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"the candle, Jennie and I want you to go with us, and look at the"
4263,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"lovely Christmas gifts in the shop windows.' Then she'd say,"
4264,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"sorrowfully, 'I don't want to see them, dear; I can't buy any of them"
4265,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"for you, and I don't want to look at them.' But I'd tease her till I"
4266,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"made her go; and I'd leave Harry, who would know all about it"
4267,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"beforehand, to lock up the dismal old room, and bring all the rest of"
4268,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"you over to the new house. You'd get there long before we did, and the"
4269,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"light would be streaming out from the little shop windows--O, so"
4270,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"bright! 'Mother,' I'd say, 'let's go in here, and buy the cotton you"
4271,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"wanted;' and when I got her in, I'd shut the door quick, and dance up"
4272,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and down, and say, 'Dear mother. Sweetie's ship's come in, and brought"
4273,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"you this new home, and everything comfortable; and Sweetie will tend"
4274,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"the shop, and you needn't sew any more day and night, for it's going to"
4275,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,be--' 'A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year for us--every one!'
4276,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Harry and all of you would shout, and our dear mother would cry for"
4277,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"joy."""
4278,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4279,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Will it come to pass soon, Sweetie?"" asked both the boys at once."
4280,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4281,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Not very, I'm afraid,"" answered Sweetie, in a subdued tone; but, when"
4282,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"she saw their look of disappointment, she brightened up in a moment,"
4283,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and added, ""It'll be all the better, when it does come, for waiting so"
4284,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"long--but look here! To-night is Christmas Eve, and we've got coal"
4285,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"enough here to make a splendid fire. We won't light it till dark, and"
4286,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,then it will last us all the evening. And I've got a great secret to
4287,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"tell you: Harry made a whole dollar yesterday, and mother is going to"
4288,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"give us each three big slices of fried mush, and bread besides, for"
4289,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"supper; and, after supper, I'll tell you the prettiest story you ever"
4290,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"heard, and we'll sing every song we know, and I guess we'll have a"
4291,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"merry Christmas if nobody else does."""

4295,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""I wish it was Christmas all the time,"" said Freddy, faintly."
4296,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4297,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Christ was born that day,"" said Sweetie, softly, ""and that makes it"

4299,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4300,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Yes,"" said Willie; ""the dear Lord who came from Heaven and, for our"

4303,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,

4306,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4307,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Then they picked up their bag, and started for home, gay as larks over"
4308,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,the prospect of the treat they were to have that night--fried mush and
4309,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"a fire! that was all, you know."
4310,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4311,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Mr. Rogers, concealed by the heavy silk curtains, had heard every word"
4312,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"they said, and his eyes were full of tears. He rang for his servant."
4313,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4314,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Harris,"" said he, when the man came in, ""follow those children, find"

4317,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"When he was left alone again, he began to think,--"

4323,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"this great city!"""
4324,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4325,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Harris soon came back, and told his master what he had learned about"

4327,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4328,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Everybody calls the oldest girl Sweetie, and they do say she's as"

4330,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4331,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Mr. Rogers went out, and, before night, had bought the little corner"

4333,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"together, he related what he had overheard the children say, and told"
4334,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"them how anxious he was to grant Sweetie's wish, and let her take her"
4335,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,mother to her new home on Christmas Day.
4336,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4337,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""But I cannot do it,"" said Mr. Rogers, ""unless you are willing to help"

4339,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4340,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"No one could refuse to aid in so good a cause; and besides, Mr. Rogers"
4341,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,was always so considerate of his servants that they were glad to
4342,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"oblige him. They all went to work with a will, and soon the little"
4343,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,house and store were put in perfect order.
4344,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4345,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"There were ribbons, laces, buttons, needles, pins, tapes, and, indeed,"
4346,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,all sorts of useful things in the store. In the cellar were coal and
4347,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"wood, two whole hams, a pair of chickens, and a turkey. The kitchen"
4348,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,pantry was stocked with sugar and flour. There was one barrel of
4349,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"potatoes, and another of the reddest apples. Up stairs the closets and"
4350,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"bureaus were bursting with nice things to wear, not quite made into"
4351,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"garments, but ready to be made, as soon as Sweetie and her mother got"
4352,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,time.
4353,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4354,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"So rapidly and so completely was everything arranged, that it seemed"
4355,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"as if one of those good fairies, of whom Sweetie had so often told the"

4357,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4358,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""The money this has cost me,"" thought Mr. Rogers, ""will make a family"

4362,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4363,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Late in the afternoon he picked his way through the dull, dirty alley"

4366,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4367,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Poor little things!"" said he; and the tears stood in his eyes."

4370,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4371,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Harry jumped to open the door as he knocked; and Mr. Rogers, entering,"
4372,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,apologized to the children's mother for his intrusion by saying he had
4373,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,come to ask a favor.
4374,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4375,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""It is but little we can do for any one, sir,"" replied Mrs. Lawson;"

4381,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4382,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""The truth is,"" said he, ""having no little folks of my own, I thought"
4383,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,I'd try and make other people's happy to-day; so I set out to get up a

4385,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"I want Sweetie to help me."""
4386,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4387,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"He spoke so sadly when he said he had no children of his own, that"

4392,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4393,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""They shan't be disappointed, I promise you,"" said Mr. Rogers, as he"

4396,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Why, I never was in a carriage in all my life,"" said Sweetie, as he"

4401,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4402,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Sweetie couldn't tell whether she was in a dream or not. Half crying,"
4403,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"half laughing, her face flushed with surprise, she asked,--"
4404,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4405,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""How did you know?"""
4406,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4407,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Know what?"" said her friend, enjoying her bewilderment."
4408,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4409,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Why,"" she answered, ""about the way I keep up the children's spirits,"
4410,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and make them forget they are hungry and cold, while I tell them about"
4411,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"my ship coming in?"""
4412,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4413,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""A little bird told me,"" said he, and then was quiet."
4414,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4415,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Sweetie did not like to ask any more; so she sat quite still, leaning"
4416,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"back in one corner of the carriage, among the soft, crimson cushions,"
4417,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and watched the people in the street, thinking how happy she was, and"
4418,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,how strange it was that little Katie Lawson should be riding with a
4419,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,grand gentleman in a splendid carriage!
4420,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4421,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Suddenly, with a whirl and a turn, they stopped before a house. Mr."
4422,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Rogers lifted her out, and led her up the broad steps; and she found"
4423,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"he was taking her into the beautiful white house, under the windows of"
4424,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,which she had sat with Willie and Fred the day before.
4425,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4426,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""Now,"" said Mr. Rogers, rolling a comfortable arm-chair for Sweetie in"
4427,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"front of a glowing fire, ""while you are getting warm, and eating your"

4430,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4431,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"A little table was brought in, and set between them, filled with so"
4432,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"many delicacies, that Sweetie's head grew dizzy at the sight. She"
4433,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"thought of her little hungry brothers and sister, and would rather not"
4434,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"have eaten, but Mr. Rogers made her."
4435,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4436,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""My little girl,"" said he, finally, ""never forget this: God always"

4438,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"for his children, he never forgets or forsakes them."""
4439,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4440,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,Then he told her that he had overheard her conversation with her
4441,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"brothers under his window, and that God had suddenly put it into his"
4442,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,heart to take care of some of the poor and fatherless in that great
4443,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"city. ""And I am going to begin with Sweetie,"" said he, very tenderly;"
4444,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""and this is the way her ship shall come in. She shall have a new home"

4447,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"corner store, instead of the dingy old garret; and here are the deeds"
4448,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"made out in Katie Lawson's own name, and nobody can take it away from"

4450,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"joy, and could not thank him,--""go and wash your face, for the horses"

4452,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"or I shall never get my Christmas tree set up."""
4453,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4454,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"An old lady, with a face beaming with kindness,--it was Mr. Rogers's"
4455,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"housekeeper,--then took Sweetie, and not only washed her tear-stained"
4456,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"cheeks, but curled her soft brown hair, and put on her the loveliest"
4457,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"blue dress, with boots to match. All the time she was dressing her,"
4458,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Sweetie, who could not believe her senses, kept murmuring,--"
4459,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4460,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""It's only a dream; it's too good to be true; the boys won't believe"

4463,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4464,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""No, indeed,"" said the old lady; ""it's really true, my dear, and I"

4467,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4468,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Sweetie could hardly realize her own good fortune; and, when she went"

4471,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""O, sir, I can't believe it. I am so happy!"""
4472,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4473,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""So am I, Sweetie,"" said Mr. Rogers; and really it was hard to tell"
4474,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,which was the happier--it is always so much more blessed to give than
4475,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"to receive. Together they rode to the new home, and laughed and cried"
4476,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"together as they went all over it. After they had been up stairs, and"
4477,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"down stairs, and in my lady's chamber, as Mr. Rogers said, he put her"
4478,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,into the carriage again.
4479,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4480,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"""James,"" said he to the coachman, ""you are under this young lady's"

4486,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,
4487,A CHRISTMAS STORY.,"James drove Sweetie home, for the last time, to the dilapidated old"

4712,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,I have some boy-cousins living in the country of whom I think a great
4713,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,deal. They write me letters quite often. I can hardly tell whose
4714,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"letters give me the most pleasure, the ""big boys',"" who write me about"
4715,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"their school, their colts and calves, their good times on the"

4717,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,telling me how many chickens they have and that they love me. I am
4718,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"sure I love them _all_, and hope they will grow to be good, true men."
4719,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,
4720,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"Charlie is one of the ""big boys."" Not _very_ big, either--just"
4721,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"thirteen years old, and rather small and slight for his years. A few"
4722,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"weeks ago a neighbor of his father's was going away, and got Charlie"
4723,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"to do ""the chores"" for him during his absence--feed the young cattle,"
4724,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,milk the cow and keep things in order about the barn. Charlie is an
4725,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"obliging boy, so he performed his task faithfully. If I had time,"
4726,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"boys, I would just like to stop here and give you a little lecture on"
4727,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"faithfulness, with Charlie for a model, for he _is_ a ""faithful boy."""
4728,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,But I want to tell my story. For two or three days Charlie went each
4729,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"morning to his neighbor's barn, and after milking the cow turned all"
4730,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"the creatures to pasture, and every night drove them home again. One"
4731,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"morning, as he stood by the bars waiting for them all to pass out, a"
4732,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"frisky year-old calf--""a yearling"" the farmers call them--instead of"
4733,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"going orderly over the bars, as a well-disposed calf should, just gave"
4734,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"a side jump and shook her horns at Charlie. ""Over with you!"" called"
4735,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"Charlie, and waved his hand at her. Miss Yearling either fancied this"
4736,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"an insult or an invitation to single combat, for she again lowered her"
4737,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"head and ran at Charlie, who had no stick, and so thought best to run"
4738,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"from the enemy. He started for the stable door, but in his hurry and"
4739,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"fright he could not open it, and while fumbling at the latch the"
4740,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"creature made another attack. Charlie dodged her again, and one of her"
4741,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"horns pierced the door nearly an inch. Again she ran at him, and with"
4742,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"her nose ""bunted"" him off his feet. Charlie was getting afraid now,"
4743,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"and called out to the folks in the house, ""Oh, come and help me!"" and"
4744,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,right then he bethought him of something he had read in his father's
4745,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"""Agriculturist"" about a boy in similar danger, who saved himself by"
4746,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,grasping the cow's horns that had attacked him. So just as the
4747,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"yearling was about to try again if she could push him over, he took"
4748,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,fast hold of each horn. But his situation was getting _very
4749,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"unpleasant_, for he was penned up in a corner, with the barn behind"
4750,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"him, a high fence on one side and the now angry heifer in front. He"
4751,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"had regained his feet, but was pushed and staggered about, for he was"
4752,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,fast losing his strength. No wonder his voice had a quiver in it as he
4753,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"again shouted as loud as he could, ""Oh, do come quick!"" The lady in"
4754,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"the house was busy getting breakfast, and heard no sound. A"
4755,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"lady-visitor in one of the chambers heard the first call, but thought"
4756,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,it only boys at play. By and by the distressed shout again smote her
4757,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"ears, and this time she heard the words, ""Help me!"" She ran down"
4758,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"stairs to the housekeeper, who opened the outside door and listened."
4759,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"Charlie's voice was weak and faint now, and the fear came to the lady"
4760,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,that he had fallen into the barn cellar. She ran quickly to the great
4761,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"door of the barn. ""Where are you, Charlie?"" ""Come to the stable door,"""
4762,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"answered back a faint, trembling voice. She quickly ran through the"
4763,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"barn to that door, but she could not open it at first, for the heifer"
4764,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,had pushed herself around till she stood broadside against the door.
4765,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"But the lady pushed hard and got the door open a little way, and"
4766,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,seizing the big stable broom hit the naughty animal two or three heavy
4767,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,whacks that made her move around; and as soon as she opened the door
4768,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"wide, Charlie let go her horns, and she (the heifer), not liking the"
4769,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"big broom-handle, turned and ran off as fast as her legs could go. The"
4770,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"lady helped Charlie up and into the house, for he could hardly stand."
4771,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"He was bruised and lame, and the breath had almost left him. But after"
4772,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"resting a while and taking some good warm drink, he tried to walk"
4773,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"home; and though the lady helped him, he found it hard work, for he"
4774,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,was so sore and bruised. Charlie's mother was frightened enough to see
4775,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,her boy come home leaning on their neighbor's arm and looking so pale.
4776,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"She helped him undress and lie down, and then she did just what your"
4777,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"mother, little reader-boy, would do if you had such an escape as"
4778,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"Charlie's. She put her arms around her boy and said, ""Let us thank the"
4779,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,"good Lord that you were not killed, my boy."" And do you think Charlie"
4780,CHARLIE'S ESCAPE.,will ever forget his escape? I don't. And I hope he will always thank

4991,A STRANGE COMBAT.,We are told that the old Romans greatly delighted in witnessing the

4993,A STRANGE COMBAT.,ransack their whole broad empire for new and unheard-of
4994,A STRANGE COMBAT.,animals--anything and everything that had fierceness and fight in it.
4995,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Those vast amphitheatres, like the Coliseum, were built to gratify"

4997,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
4998,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"But I doubt whether even the old Romans, with all their large"
4999,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"experience, ever beheld so strange and grotesque a ""set-to"" (I'm"
5000,A STRANGE COMBAT.,pretty sure none of our American boys ever did) as the writer once
5001,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"stumbled upon, on the shores of one of our Northern Maine lakes--Lake"
5002,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Pennesseewassee, if you can pronounce that; it trips up editors"
5003,A STRANGE COMBAT.,sometimes.
5004,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5005,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"I had been spending the day in the neighboring forest, hunting for a"
5006,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"black squirrel I had seen there the evening before, having with me a"
5007,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"great, red-shirted lumberman, named Ben--Ben Murch. And not finding"
5008,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"our squirrel, we were making our way, towards evening, down through"
5009,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"the thick alders which skirted the lake, to the shore, in the hope of"
5010,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"getting a shot at an otter, or a mink, when all at once a great sound,"
5011,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"a sort of _quock, quock_, accompanied by a great splashing of the"
5012,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"water, came to our ears."
5013,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5014,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""Hush!"" ejaculated Ben, clapping his hand to his ear (as his custom"
5015,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"was), to catch the sound. ""Hear that? Some sort of a fracas."""
5016,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5017,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"And cautiously pushing through the dense copse, a very singular and"
5018,A STRANGE COMBAT.,comical spectacle met our eyes. For out some two or three rods from
5019,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"the muddy, grassy shore stood a tall, a very tall bird,--somewhere"
5020,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"from four to five feet, I judged,--with long, thin, black legs, and"
5021,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"an awkward body, slovenly clad in dull gray-blue plumage. The neck"
5022,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"was as long as the legs, and the head small, and nearly bare, with a"
5023,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"long, yellowish bill. Standing knee deep in the muddied water, it was,"
5024,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"on the whole, about the most ungainly-looking fowl you can well"
5025,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"imagine; while on a half-buried tree trunk, running out towards it"
5026,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"into the water, crouched a wiry, black creature, of about average dog"
5027,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"size, wriggling a long, restless tail, and apparently in the very act"
5028,A STRANGE COMBAT.,of springing at the long-legged biped in the water. Just now they were
5029,A STRANGE COMBAT.,eying each other very intently; but from the splashed and bedraggled
5030,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"appearance of both, it was evident there had been recent hostilities,"
5031,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"which, judging from the attitude of the combatants, were about to be"
5032,A STRANGE COMBAT.,renewed.
5033,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5034,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""Show!"" exclaimed Ben, peering over my shoulder from behind. ""An old"
5035,A STRANGE COMBAT.,_hairn_--ain't it? Regular old _pokey_. Thought I'd heered that
5036,A STRANGE COMBAT.,_quock_ before. And that creatur'? Let's see. Odd-looking chap. Wish
5037,A STRANGE COMBAT.,he'd turn his head this way. Fisher--ain't it? Looks like one. Should
5038,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"judge that's a fisher-cat. What in the world got them at loggerheads,"
5039,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"I wonder?"""
5040,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5041,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"By ""hairn"" Ben meant _heron_, the great blue heron of American"
5042,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"waters--_Ardea Herodias_ of the naturalists. And fisher, or"
5043,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"fisher-cat, is the common name among hunters for Pennant's marten, or"
5044,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"the _Mustela canadensis_, a very fierce carnivorous animal, of the"
5045,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"weasel family, growing from three to four feet in length, called also"
5046,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""the black cat."""
5047,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5048,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"The fisher had doubtless been the assailant, though both had now that"
5049,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"intent, tired-down air which marks a long fray. He had probably crept"
5050,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"up from behind, while old long-shanks was quietly frogging along the"
5051,A STRANGE COMBAT.,shore.
5052,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5053,A STRANGE COMBAT.,But he had found his intended victim a game one. The heron had a
5054,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"character to sustain; and although he might easily have flown away, or"
5055,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"even waded farther out, yet he seemed to scorn to do either."
5056,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5057,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Not an inch would it budge, but stood with its long, javelin-like beak"
5058,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"poised, ready to strike into the fisher's eye, uttering, from moment"
5059,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"to moment, that menacing, guttural _quock_, which had first attracted"
5060,A STRANGE COMBAT.,our attention.
5061,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5062,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"This sound, mingling with the eager snarling and fretting of the cat,"
5063,A STRANGE COMBAT.,made the most dismal and incongruous duet I had ever listened to. For
5064,A STRANGE COMBAT.,some moments they stood thus threatening and defying each other; but
5065,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"at length, lashing itself up to the proper pitch of fury, the fisher"
5066,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"jumped at his antagonist with distended jaws, to seize hold of the"
5067,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"long, slender throat. One bite at the heron's slim neck would settle"
5068,A STRANGE COMBAT.,the whole affair. But this attempt was very adroitly balked by the
5069,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"plucky old wader's taking a long step aside, when the fisher fell into"
5070,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"the water with a great splash, and while struggling back to the log,"
5071,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"received a series of strokes, or, rather, stabs, from the long,"
5072,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"pointed beak, dealt down with wonderful swiftness, and force, too; for"
5073,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"we distinctly heard them _prod_ into the cat's tough hide, as he"
5074,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"scrambled upon the log, and ran spitting up the bank. This defeat,"
5075,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"however, was but temporary, as any one acquainted with the singular"
5076,A STRANGE COMBAT.,persistence and perseverance of the whole weasel family will readily
5077,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"guess. The fisher had soon worked his way down the log again, the"
5078,A STRANGE COMBAT.,heron retiring to his former position in the water.
5079,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5080,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Another succession of quocks and growlings, and another spring, with"
5081,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"even less success, on the side of the cat. For this time the heron's"
5082,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"bill wounded one of his eyes; and as he again retreated up the log, we"
5083,A STRANGE COMBAT.,could see the bloody tears trickling down over his shaggy jowl.
5084,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5085,A STRANGE COMBAT.,Thus far the battle seemed favorable to the heron; but the fisher
5086,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"again rallied, and, now thoroughly maddened, rushed down the log, and"
5087,A STRANGE COMBAT.,leaped blindly upon his foe. Again and again his attacks were parried.
5088,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"The snarling growls now rose to shrieks, and the croaking quocks to"
5089,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"loud, dissonant cries."
5090,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5091,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""Faugh!"" muttered Ben. ""Smell his breath--fisher's breath--clean here."
5092,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Always let that out somehow when they're mad."""
5093,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5094,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Even at our distance, that strong, fetid odor, sometimes perceptible"
5095,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"when a cat spits, could plainly be discerned."
5096,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5097,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""Old _hairn_ seems to be having the best of it,"" continued Ben. ""I bet"
5098,A STRANGE COMBAT.,on him. How cool he keeps! Fights like a machine. See that bill come
5099,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"down now! Look at the marks it makes, too!"" For the blood, oozing out"
5100,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"through the thick fur of the cat in more than a dozen spots, was"
5101,A STRANGE COMBAT.,attesting the prowess of the heron's powerful beak.
5102,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5103,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"But at length, with a sudden bound upward, the fisher fell with his"
5104,A STRANGE COMBAT.,whole weight upon the back of his lathy antagonist. Old long-legs was
5105,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"upset, and down they both went in the water, where a prodigious"
5106,A STRANGE COMBAT.,scuffle ensued. Now one of the heron's big feet would be thrust up
5107,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"nearly a yard; then the cat would come to the top, sneezing and"
5108,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"strangling; and anon the heron's long neck would loop up in sight,"
5109,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"bending and doubling about in frantic attempts to peck at its foe, its"
5110,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"cries now resembling those of a hen when seized in the night, save"
5111,A STRANGE COMBAT.,that they were louder and harsher. Over and over they floundered and
5112,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"rolled. The mud and water flew about. Long legs, shaggy paws, wet,"
5113,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"wriggling tail, and squawking beak, fur and feathers--all turning and"
5114,A STRANGE COMBAT.,squirming in inextricable confusion. It was hard telling which was
5115,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"having the best of the _mêlée_, when, on a sudden, the struggle"
5116,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"stopped, as if by magic."
5117,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5118,A STRANGE COMBAT.,[Illustration: {The marten about to attack the heron}]
5119,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5120,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"""One or t'other has given in,"" muttered Ben."
5121,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5122,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Looking more closely, we saw that the fisher had succeeded in getting"
5123,A STRANGE COMBAT.,the heron's neck into his mouth. One bite had been sufficient. The
5124,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"fray was over. And after holding on a while, the victor, up to his"
5125,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"back in water, began moving towards the shore, dragging along with"
5126,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"him, by the neck, the body of the heron, whose great feet came"
5127,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"trailing after at an astonishing distance behind. To see him, wet as a"
5128,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"drowned rat, tugging up the muddy bank with his ill-omened and"
5129,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"unsightly prey, was indeed a singular spectacle. Whatever had brought"
5130,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"on this queer contest, the fisher had won--fairly, too, for aught I"
5131,A STRANGE COMBAT.,could see; and I hadn't it in my heart to intercept his retreat. But
5132,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Ben, to whom a ""black cat"" was particularly obnoxious, from its"
5133,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"nefarious habit of robbing traps, had no such scruples, and, bringing"
5134,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"up his rifle with the careless quickness of an old woodsman, fired"
5135,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"before I could interpose a word. The fisher dropped, and after"
5136,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"writhing and snapping a few moments, stretched out--dead."
5137,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5138,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"Leaving Ben to take off its skin,--for the fur is worth a trifle,--I"
5139,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"was strolling along the shore, when upon coming under a drooping"
5140,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"cedar, some six or seven rods from the scene of the fight, another"
5141,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"large heron sprang out of a clump of brambles, and stalked off with a"
5142,A STRANGE COMBAT.,croak of distrust. It at once occurred to me that there might be a
5143,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"nest here; and opening the brambles, lo, there it was, a broad,"
5144,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"clumsy structure of coarse sticks, some two or three feet from the"
5145,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"ground, and lined with moss and water grasses. In it, or, rather, on"
5146,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"it, were two chicks, heron chicks, uncouth little things, with long,"
5147,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"skinny legs and necks, and sparsely clad with tufts of gray down. And"
5148,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"happening to glance under the nest, I perceived an egg, lodged down"
5149,A STRANGE COMBAT.,among the bramble-stalks. It had probably rolled out of the nest. It
5150,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"struck me, however, as being a very small egg from so large a bird;"
5151,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"and having a rule in my pocket, I found it to be but two and a half"
5152,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"inches in length by one and a half in width. It was of a dull,"
5153,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"bluish-white color, without spots, though rather rough and uneven. I"
5154,A STRANGE COMBAT.,took it home as a curiosity.
5155,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5156,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"On the edge of the nest I saw several small perch, a frog, and a"
5157,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"meadow-mouse, all recently brought, though the place had a suspicious"
5158,A STRANGE COMBAT.,odor of carrion.
5159,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5160,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"All this while the old heron had stood at a little distance away,"
5161,A STRANGE COMBAT.,uttering now and then an ominous croak. I could easily have shot it
5162,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"from where I stood, but thought the family had suffered enough for one"
5163,A STRANGE COMBAT.,day.
5164,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5165,A STRANGE COMBAT.,The presence of the nest accounted for the obstinacy with which the
5166,A STRANGE COMBAT.,old male heron had contested the ground with the fisher.
5167,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5168,A STRANGE COMBAT.,Both old birds are said to sit by turns upon the eggs. But the nests
5169,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"are not always placed so near the ground as this one. Last summer,"
5170,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"while fishing from the ""Pappoose's Pond,"" I discovered one in the very"
5171,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"top of a lofty Norway pine--a huge bunch of sticks and long grass,"
5172,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"upon the edge of which one of the old herons was standing on one foot,"
5173,A STRANGE COMBAT.,"perfectly motionless, with its neck drawn down, and seemingly asleep."
5174,A STRANGE COMBAT.,
5175,A STRANGE COMBAT.,The artist who could have properly sketched that nest and bird would
5176,A STRANGE COMBAT.,have made his fortune then and there.

5213,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5214,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""We've had a good time, Tony, old fellow, haven't we?"" said Neddy"
5215,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"Harris, who was beginning to feel tired with his half day's ramble in"
5216,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,the fields. As he said this he sat down on some boards in the barn.
5217,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5218,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"Tony replied to his young master by rubbing his nose against his face,"
5219,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"and by a soft ""baa,"" which was as near as he could come to saying, ""A"
5220,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"first-rate time, Master Neddy."""
5221,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5222,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""A grand good time,"" added the boy, putting his arms around the lamb's"
5223,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,neck and laying his face on its soft wool.
5224,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5225,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""And now,"" he continued, ""as father says we should always do, I'll"
5226,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,just go back and think over what I've done this holiday afternoon; and
5227,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"if I forgot myself in anything and went wrong, it will be best for me"
5228,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"to know it, so that I can do better next time."
5229,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5230,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""I'm sorry about that poor squirrel,"" said Neddy; ""he never did me any"
5231,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"harm. What a beautiful little creature he was, with his bright black"
5232,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"eyes and shiny skin!"""
5233,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5234,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"And the boy's face grew sad, as well it might, for he had pelted this"
5235,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"squirrel with stones from tree to tree, and at last knocked him to the"
5236,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,ground.
5237,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5238,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""But it was so cruel in me! Now, if I live a hundred years, I'll never"
5239,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"harm another squirrel. God made these frisky little fellows, and"
5240,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"they've just as much right to live as I have."""
5241,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5242,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"Neddy felt better about the squirrel after this good resolution, which"
5243,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,he meant to keep.
5244,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5245,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""That was curious about the spider,"" he went on, trying to push all"
5246,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,thoughts of the dead squirrel from his mind. Let me tell you about
5247,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,this spider. In the corner of a fence Neddy saw a large circular
5248,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"spider's web, shaped like a funnel, down in the centre of which was a"
5249,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"hole. As he stood looking at the delicate thing, finer than any woven"
5250,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"silk, a fly struck against it and got his feet tangled, so that he"
5251,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,could not escape. Instantly a great black spider ran out of the hole
5252,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"at the bottom of the web, and seizing the poor fly dragged him out of"
5253,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,sight and made his dinner off of him.
5254,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5255,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,Neddy dropped a piece of dry bark about the size of his thumb nail
5256,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"into the web, and it slipped down and covered the hole through which"
5257,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,the spider had to come for his prey. Instantly the piece of bark was
5258,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"pushed up by the spider, who came out of his den and ran around on the"
5259,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,slender cords of his web in a troubled kind of way. Then he tried to
5260,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"get back into his hidden chamber, but the piece of bark covered the"
5261,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,entrance like a shut door. And now Mr. Spider was in a terrible
5262,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,flurry. He ran wildly up one side of his web and down another; then he
5263,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"tugged at the piece of bark, trying to drag it out, but its rough"
5264,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,edges took hold of the fine silken threads and tore them.
5265,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5266,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""You'll catch no more flies in that web, old chap,"" said Neddy as he"
5267,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,stood watching the spider.
5268,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5269,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,But Neddy was mistaken. Spider did not belong to the give-up class. If
5270,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"the thing could not be done in one way, it might in another. He did"
5271,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"not reason about things like human beings, but then he had instinct,"
5272,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"as it is called, and that teaches animals how to get their food, how"
5273,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"to build their houses or make their nests, and how to meet the dangers"
5274,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,and difficulties that overtake them in life. After sitting still for a
5275,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"little while, spider went to work again, and this time in a surprising"
5276,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,way. He cut a circle close around the piece of bark as neatly as you
5277,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"could have done with a pair of sharp scissors, and lo! it dropped to"
5278,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"the ground, leaving a hole in the web about the size of a ten-cent"
5279,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,piece.
5280,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5281,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""Rather hard on the web, Mr. Landpirate,"" said Neddy, laughing. ""Flies"
5282,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"can go through there as well as chips."""
5283,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5284,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"When he called the spider a land-pirate, Neddy was wrong. He was no"
5285,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"more a pirate--that is, one who robs and murders--than is the"
5286,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"woodpecker or swallow, for they feed on worms and insects. The spider"
5287,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,was just as blameless in his work of catching and eating flies as was
5288,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,Neddy's white bantam when she went off into the fields after
5289,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,grasshoppers.
5290,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5291,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,But Neddy's laugh at the spider was soon cut short. The most difficult
5292,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,part of his work was done when he got rid of the piece of bark. As
5293,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,soon as that was out of his way he began moving backward and forward
5294,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"over the hole he had cut in the web, just as if he were a weaver's"
5295,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"shuttle, and in about ten minutes it was all covered with gauzy"
5296,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,lacework finer than ever was worn by a queen.
5297,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,
5298,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"""I'll give it up, old fellow,"" exclaimed Neddy, taking a long breath"
5299,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"as he saw the work completed. ""This just beats me out."" Spider crept"
5300,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"down into his den again to wait for another fly, and Neddy, leading"
5301,NEDDY'S HALF HOLIDAY.,"Tony, went on his way pleased and wondering."

5334,A TRUE STORY.,
5335,A TRUE STORY.,
5336,A TRUE STORY.,"Early on a cloudy April afternoon, many years ago, several little"
5337,A TRUE STORY.,"girls were playing in a village door-yard, not far from the fence"
5338,A TRUE STORY.,which separated it from a neighbor's. They were building a play-house
5339,A TRUE STORY.,"of boards, and were so busily occupied, that none of them had noticed"
5340,A TRUE STORY.,a lady standing at a little four-paned window in the house the other
5341,A TRUE STORY.,"side of the fence, who had been intently regarding them for some time."
5342,A TRUE STORY.,"The window was so constructed as to swing back like a door, and being"
5343,A TRUE STORY.,"now open, the lady's face was framed against the dark background of"
5344,A TRUE STORY.,"the room, producing the effect of a picture. 'Twas a strange face,"
5345,A TRUE STORY.,"sallow and curiously wrinkled, with a nose like the beak of a hawk,"
5346,A TRUE STORY.,"and large black eyes, which seemed to be endowed with the power of"
5347,A TRUE STORY.,perpetual motion. These roved from one to another of the busy
5348,A TRUE STORY.,"builders, till suddenly one of them seemed to be aware that some one"
5349,A TRUE STORY.,"was looking at her, and turned towards the little window."
5350,A TRUE STORY.,
5351,A TRUE STORY.,"""Ah, I know you, Wealthy Robbins! Come here a minute, my little dear,"""
5352,A TRUE STORY.,"spoke the lady, in a shrill, quavering voice. And she beckoned to her"
5353,A TRUE STORY.,"with a hooked finger like a claw. But Wealthy shrank back, murmuring,"
5354,A TRUE STORY.,"""I don't want to,"" almost under her breath, and nudging with her elbow"
5355,A TRUE STORY.,"the nearest girl; ""Hannah, Mrs. Pike wants something. See!"""
5356,A TRUE STORY.,
5357,A TRUE STORY.,"""Is that you, Hannah Green? Come over here, and I'll give you a piece"
5358,A TRUE STORY.,"of my Passover candy."" And the lady waved in the air a long candle-rod"
5359,A TRUE STORY.,"entwined with a strip of scarlet flannel, which made it look like a"
5360,A TRUE STORY.,mammoth stick of peppermint candy.
5361,A TRUE STORY.,
5362,A TRUE STORY.,"This attracted the attention of all the girls, and going close to the"
5363,A TRUE STORY.,"fence, they peered through, while she besought them, with enticing"
5364,A TRUE STORY.,"promises and imploring eyes, to come around under the window, for she"
5365,A TRUE STORY.,had something to tell them.
5366,A TRUE STORY.,
5367,A TRUE STORY.,"""Don't let's go,"" whispered Mary Green, the oldest of the group."
5368,A TRUE STORY.,"""Mother told me never to go near her window when she's standing there,"

5374,A TRUE STORY.,
5375,A TRUE STORY.,"At last, Sarah Holmes and her sister Jane went around, and stood under"
5376,A TRUE STORY.,the little window. Jane said it could do no harm just to go and see
5377,A TRUE STORY.,"what Mrs. Pike wanted, and if _she_ was shut up in jail, she guessed"
5378,A TRUE STORY.,she'd want a good many things.
5379,A TRUE STORY.,
5380,A TRUE STORY.,"""Now, you dear little lambs, you see I'm all alone in the house; and"
5381,A TRUE STORY.,"they've gone away, and forgotten to give me my dinner; and I'm _very_"
5382,A TRUE STORY.,"hungry. All I want is a little unleavened bread, for this is Passover"

5384,A TRUE STORY.,"little Sarah,--Jane can help you,--and unlock my door, so I can go to"
5385,A TRUE STORY.,the buttery and get some bread. Then I'll bring you out a nice saucer
5386,A TRUE STORY.,"mince pie, and come back here, and you can lock me in. They'll never"
5387,A TRUE STORY.,"know; and I shall starve if you don't take pity on me."""
5388,A TRUE STORY.,
5389,A TRUE STORY.,"After some whispering together, the little girls did as they were"
5390,A TRUE STORY.,"bidden, notwithstanding the warnings of their mates the other side of"
5391,A TRUE STORY.,"the fence. When they had disappeared from view, Mary Green turned"
5392,A TRUE STORY.,"away, and began to hammer, as though she was driving a nail into Mrs."
5393,A TRUE STORY.,"Pike's head, or Jane Holmes's, or somebody's, ejaculating, ""I guess"
5394,A TRUE STORY.,"they'll rue this day."""
5395,A TRUE STORY.,
5396,A TRUE STORY.,Which prophetic words came very near being verified at the moment
5397,A TRUE STORY.,they were spoken. For no sooner had Jane unlocked the door of Mrs.
5398,A TRUE STORY.,"Pike's room, than out sprang that lady, and clutched one of the little"
5399,A TRUE STORY.,"girls with either hand, almost shrieking, ""Ah, I know you! you belong"
5400,A TRUE STORY.,to that wicked and rebellious tribe of Korah. Why didn't you come over
5401,A TRUE STORY.,"to the help of the mighty immediately? Now, you shall see how _you_"
5402,A TRUE STORY.,"like dwelling in the Cave of Machpelah for a day and a night, and a"
5403,A TRUE STORY.,"month and a year, until He shall come whose right it is to reign."""
5404,A TRUE STORY.,
5405,A TRUE STORY.,"And she thrust the trembling, awe-struck children into the room that"
5406,A TRUE STORY.,"had been her prison, and turned the key upon them. Then away she"
5407,A TRUE STORY.,"strode out of the house and up the street, a noticeable figure, truly,"
5408,A TRUE STORY.,"in her short yellow nankeen dress, with pantalets of the same, and"
5409,A TRUE STORY.,"neat white Quaker cap, with long white ribbons crossed under her chin,"
5410,A TRUE STORY.,and carrying an immense umbrella over her head. It was strange that
5411,A TRUE STORY.,none of the nearest neighbors should see her pass. The front door was
5412,A TRUE STORY.,on the opposite side of the house from where the little girls were
5413,A TRUE STORY.,playing; so they did not observe her exit; and thus it happened that
5414,A TRUE STORY.,"the crazy lady, who had been confined in the house for weeks, escaped"
5415,A TRUE STORY.,"without any check upon her triumphant progress. Busy women, seeing her"
5416,A TRUE STORY.,"from their windows, thought Mrs. Pike must be better again, to be out,"
5417,A TRUE STORY.,and did wish her friends wouldn't let her walk the streets looking
5418,A TRUE STORY.,"like a Dutch woman. Boys paused in their games almost respectfully, as"
5419,A TRUE STORY.,she passed by; for notwithstanding her strange appearance and rapid
5420,A TRUE STORY.,"movements, there was an air of mysterious command about the woman"
5421,A TRUE STORY.,which checked any rudeness.
5422,A TRUE STORY.,
5423,A TRUE STORY.,"""There goes Madam Pike,"" exclaimed one ragged-kneed boy, when she had"
5424,A TRUE STORY.,"passed out of hearing. ""Got on her ascension-robe--hasn't she? Wonder"
5425,A TRUE STORY.,"if that umberil will help her any? I say, boys, do you suppose all the"
5426,A TRUE STORY.,"saints that walk the streets of the new Jerusalem look like her?"""
5427,A TRUE STORY.,
5428,A TRUE STORY.,"While Mrs. Pike walked rapidly on, with a keen appreciation of the"
5429,A TRUE STORY.,"fresh air and occasional gleams of sunshine, the little prisoners"
5430,A TRUE STORY.,drooped like two April violets plucked and thrown upon the ground.
5431,A TRUE STORY.,"They were so frightened and awe-struck, that the idea of calling for"
5432,A TRUE STORY.,help from the open window did not occur to them; and they crouched
5433,A TRUE STORY.,"upon the floor, melancholy and mute. After a while, some odd-looking"
5434,A TRUE STORY.,"garments, hanging in a row on one side of the room, attracted their"
5435,A TRUE STORY.,attention; but they did not dare to go near them at first. Mrs. Pike
5436,A TRUE STORY.,"was what was called a Second Adventist, and had read the Bible and"
5437,A TRUE STORY.,"Apocrypha with a fiery zeal, and an earnest determination to find"
5438,A TRUE STORY.,"therein proof of what she believed, and had attended Second Advent"
5439,A TRUE STORY.,"meetings, and exhorted wherever she could get a hearing, until her"
5440,A TRUE STORY.,poor brain was crazed. But lately her husband and friends had kept her
5441,A TRUE STORY.,in doors as much as possible; and she spent most of the time knitting
5442,A TRUE STORY.,ascension-robes for the saints of the twelve tribes of the house of
5443,A TRUE STORY.,"Judah. These were long garments, coming nearly to the feet, each of a"
5444,A TRUE STORY.,"single color, royal purple and blue being her favorites. She said that"
5445,A TRUE STORY.,"she must improve every moment, lest the great and dreadful day of the"
5446,A TRUE STORY.,"Lord should come, and she should not be ready, i. e., would not have a"
5447,A TRUE STORY.,"robe prepared for each of the saints to ascend in. When her son, a boy"
5448,A TRUE STORY.,"of twelve, died, she had him buried by the front doorstep, so, when"
5449,A TRUE STORY.,"the procession of saints should pass out at the door, Erastus could"
5450,A TRUE STORY.,"join them immediately, and not have to come from the burying-ground, a"
5451,A TRUE STORY.,mile away.
5452,A TRUE STORY.,
5453,A TRUE STORY.,"It was after sunset when Mr. Pike passed along the village street, on"
5454,A TRUE STORY.,"his way home, and was informed by a good woman, standing at her gate,"
5455,A TRUE STORY.,"that his wife had gone by about one o'clock, and that, not long after,"
5456,A TRUE STORY.,Jane and Sarah Holmes were missed. Some little girls they had been
5457,A TRUE STORY.,playing with had seen them get into Mr. Pike's house through the
5458,A TRUE STORY.,"dining-room window, and that was the last that had been seen or heard"
5459,A TRUE STORY.,"of them. Mrs. Holmes was going on dreadfully; for she thought that, as"
5460,A TRUE STORY.,"likely as not, Madam Pike had thrown them down in the well, or hid"
5461,A TRUE STORY.,"them where they would never be found, and then run away. The"
5462,A TRUE STORY.,"bewildered man hurried home to harness his horse, and go in search of"
5463,A TRUE STORY.,"his wife; for, with a trust in her better nature, worthy of a woman,"
5464,A TRUE STORY.,"he believed that she would tell him where the children were, if she"
5465,A TRUE STORY.,"knew. Fortunately, he found her in a tavern about a mile from home,"
5466,A TRUE STORY.,"preaching, as the children would say. As usual, she was exhorting her"
5467,A TRUE STORY.,"hearers to prepare for the great and terrible day of the Lord, etc.,"
5468,A TRUE STORY.,"etc.; but when her husband appeared in the doorway, the thread of her"
5469,A TRUE STORY.,"discourse was suddenly broken, and she turned and accosted him with,"
5470,A TRUE STORY.,"""Ah, Mr. Pike, have you seen my prisoners in the Cave of Machpelah?"
5471,A TRUE STORY.,"They belong to that wicked and rebellious tribe of Korah, you know."""
5472,A TRUE STORY.,
5473,A TRUE STORY.,"""Well, Mary, let's go home, and see how they are getting along,"" said"
5474,A TRUE STORY.,"he, in a confident tone; for he instantly divined who her prisoners"
5475,A TRUE STORY.,"were, and that the Cave of Machpelah could not be far away."
5476,A TRUE STORY.,
5477,A TRUE STORY.,"Mrs. Pike was quite willing to go with him, and worried all the way"

5479,A TRUE STORY.,"the robes hanging in the cave, which she had forgotten to put out of"
5480,A TRUE STORY.,"their reach. So when they arrived, her first act was to unlock the"
5481,A TRUE STORY.,door of the children's prison. And her next was to pounce upon them
5482,A TRUE STORY.,with even more vigor than when she emerged from it in the afternoon.
5483,A TRUE STORY.,"For there they lay asleep on the carpet, Jane in a purple robe, and"

5486,A TRUE STORY.,
5487,A TRUE STORY.,"""Don't hurt them, Mary,"" said Mr. Pike. For she was hustling off the"

5489,A TRUE STORY.,"might have fared hardly, had not the kind man been present to see that"
5490,A TRUE STORY.,"justice was done; to wit, that they were compensated for their"
5491,A TRUE STORY.,"imprisonment by pockets full of cakes and fruit, and sent home to"
5492,A TRUE STORY.,their mother without delay. That happy woman did not send them
5493,A TRUE STORY.,"supperless to bed, nor say a word about punishing them, either then or"
5494,A TRUE STORY.,afterwards. Perhaps she guessed that their punishment had already been
5495,A TRUE STORY.,sufficiently severe.

5497,A TRUE STORY.,"""O, mother,"" said Jane, ""at first we didn't dare to stir or speak, for"

5499,A TRUE STORY.,"us. I felt as if my hair was turning gray, and Sarah looked as white"
5500,A TRUE STORY.,"as the wall. Well, after a great many hours, we began to look about"
5501,A TRUE STORY.,"the room, and we saw those queer gowns she knits, hanging in a row;"
5502,A TRUE STORY.,and we got up and looked at them. By and by we got so tired doing
5503,A TRUE STORY.,"nothing, that we took them down and tried them on, and played we were"
5504,A TRUE STORY.,"the saints. We tried to fly, but the old things were so heavy and"
5505,A TRUE STORY.,"long, that we couldn't even jump. And after a while we were so tired"
5506,A TRUE STORY.,"that we lay down and went to sleep, and never woke till Mrs. Pike came"
5507,A TRUE STORY.,"home. O, but 'twas the lonesomest, longest, dreariest afternoon we"

5612,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5613,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""You know that hollow down in the pasture,"" continued Mr. Davy, ""and"
5614,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,what a blemish it is upon the farm. I have wondered if we could not
5615,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"make it useful in some way, and at the same time improve the looks of"
5616,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"things. I think we might build an embankment upon the open side, make"
5617,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the slope steeper all round, bring the water into it from the creek,"
5618,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,and so have a fishing-pond. We should have to make a race-way from the
5619,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"creek to the pond, and cut a channel through the meadow, in which the"
5620,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,water could flow back to the creek again below the fall. I think it
5621,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"could be done,"" said Mr. Davy, after a pause, ""only there would be a"
5622,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"great deal of work necessary, and we could hardly afford to hire it"
5623,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"done."""
5624,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5625,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""O, father, _we_ can do the digging,"" shouted five voices in chorus;"
5626,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""we can do it with our spades and wheelbarrows. School doesn't begin"
5627,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"for a month yet, and we can get it all done in that time."""
5628,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5629,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Hurrah for a fish-pond!"" cried Percy, and in imagination he fairly"
5630,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,felt the bites of the three-pound trout he was to catch before summer
5631,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,was over.
5632,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5633,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Mr. Davy is a practical farmer. By that I mean that he cultivates the
5634,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"land with his own hands. He, with his men, and those of the boys who"
5635,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"are old enough, are in the fields every morning in summer by five"
5636,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"o'clock, ploughing, planting, sowing, or milking the cows, and, later"
5637,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"in the season, haying, harvesting, or threshing. Tommy, the eldest of"
5638,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"his sons, is thirteen years old; Clarence, the youngest, is five."
5639,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5640,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Mr. Davy had been thinking of the fishing-pond for some time, and had"
5641,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,matured the plan in his mind before speaking of it to the boys. The
5642,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"morning after the conversation of which I have told you, I saw the"
5643,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,five boys standing in thoughtful silence upon the bank above the
5644,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,hollow in the pasture. I do not believe the engineer who is planning
5645,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the bridge across the British Channel, to connect England and France,"
5646,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,feels anymore responsibility than did the Davy boys that morning.
5647,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5648,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""May we begin to-day, father?"" said they, eagerly, at breakfast-time."
5649,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5650,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Yes; and Patrick can help you,"" was the reply."
5651,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5652,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The horses were harnessed to the plough, and driven to the hollow."
5653,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Patrick was instructed how to proceed. He put the reins round his
5654,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"neck, and took firm hold of the handles. ""Go on wid ye, now!"" he cried"
5655,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"to the horses. A furrow was soon turned, and the fish-pond fairly"
5656,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,begun.
5657,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5658,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Your work,"" said Mr. Davy to the boys, ""will be to wheel away the"
5659,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,earth which Patrick ploughs out. The first thing is to lay a plank
5660,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"for your wheelbarrows to run upon."""
5661,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5662,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Tommy and George soon brought the planks from the tool-house. Blocks
5663,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"were laid the proper distance apart to sustain them, and, after two or"
5664,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"three hours' work, a line of plank, which looked to the boys as grand"
5665,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"as the new Pacific Railway, stretched across the hollow. The little"
5666,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"laborers went in to dinner flushed with excitement and hard work, but"
5667,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"as happy, I dare say, as if they had been to Barnum's Museum, and seen"
5668,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the wax figures and wild animals.
5669,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5670,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Patrick had, during the forenoon, ploughed a good many furrows, and"
5671,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,now the boys were busy enough carrying away the earth. Each had a
5672,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"wheelbarrow of his own--Clarence's a toy, which, with a tiny spade,"
5673,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,his father had brought from the city with a view to the work now in
5674,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,progress. It required a steady hand to keep the wheelbarrows upon the
5675,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"plank. They _would_ run off once in a while, and then all hands"
5676,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"halted, and lifted them upon the track again. The earth was to be"
5677,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"deposited--""dumped,"" the boys said--upon the site of the new"
5678,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"embankment. As the first loads were overturned, Mr. Davy made his"
5679,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,appearance.
5680,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5681,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""This fish-pond must have an outlet, you know,"" said he, ""at the point"
5682,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"where the bottom is lowest. I will measure it off for you, and drive"
5683,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,three stakes on either side. Here we will have a gate; for our pond
5684,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,will need emptying and cleaning occasionally. Fish will not live in
5685,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"impure water."""
5686,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5687,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The boys were delighted. All this excavating, laying out of"
5688,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"earthworks, and planning of gate-way, seemed like real engineering."
5689,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"They were reënforced, after a while, by Patrick and the horses; and"
5690,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"then how suddenly they became tired, his shovelfuls were so large in"
5691,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,comparison with theirs--his wagon carried away so much more at a load!
5692,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5693,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Pretty early that evening little Clarence crept into his mother's
5694,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"lap, and told her a marvellous story of the amount of earth he had"
5695,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,wheeled away; but his tired little eyes acted as though some of it had
5696,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,blown between their lids; and soon mamma tucked him away for twelve
5697,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,hours' sleep.
5698,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5699,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The hollow in the pasture, I forgot to say, was half an acre in"
5700,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"extent, and appeared as though Nature had scooped it out on purpose to"
5701,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"make a place for the Davy boys' fishing-pond. The creek, too, running"
5702,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"nearly alongside, was there to supply it with water."
5703,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5704,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""What shall we ever do with that hill?"" said Percy, pointing to a rise"
5705,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"of ground on one side the hollow, as he and his brothers were"
5706,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"surveying their work; ""we never can cart all that away, nor dig up"
5707,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"those trees, either."""
5708,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5709,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Let's leave it for an island,"" said Frank--""a _real_ island--land"
5710,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"with water all round it"" (he had just begun studying geography); ""and"
5711,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the trees will make a splendid grove, where we can have picnics."""
5712,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5713,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""The island will afford a harbor for the boat, too,"" said Mr. Davy,"
5714,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"who had just joined the children. ""I suppose you will want a boat on"
5715,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"your pond--will you not?"""
5716,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5717,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The boys could scarcely believe their ears. A boat of their own, on"
5718,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,their own pond! They had never dreamed of anything half so nice.
5719,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5720,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Time to be at work!"" said Mr. Davy."
5721,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5722,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"All the forenoon, as I watched them from my window, I saw the"
5723,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"embankment growing slowly, but steadily, while the sloping sides of"
5724,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the hollow became steeper and steeper. At night a visible step had
5725,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,been taken towards a fishing-pond.
5726,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5727,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,I cannot tell you about every one of the days during which the Davy
5728,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"boys worked so industriously. At last, however, the excavation was"
5729,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"completed, the embankment raised to the desired height. The frame for"
5730,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the gate-way stood firm between its crowding sides. Gates were in
5731,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"progress at the carpenter's, made of solid plank, a door sliding up"
5732,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,and down over an open space near the bottom. This was easily worked by
5733,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,means of a handle at the top.
5734,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5735,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""And now,"" said Mr. Davy, ""to get the water into the pond. Patrick and"
5736,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Michael must build a dam a little way up the creek and the race-way
5737,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,from a point just above. We shall need a gate similar to the one at
5738,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the outlet."""
5739,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5740,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The boys were glad to give way to Patrick and Michael, when it came to"
5741,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,building dams and race-ways. In the mean time they assisted the mason
5742,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"who was lining the embankment on either side the gate with stone, to"
5743,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"protect it against the action of the water. The stone-boat, a little,"
5744,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"flat vehicle which slides over the ground without wheels, was brought"
5745,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"out, for piles of stone were to be drawn from a distant part of the"
5746,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,farm.
5747,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5748,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""But I shall want one of you to carry the hod for me,"" said the mason."
5749,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5750,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,It was arranged that they should take turns at this; so one would stay
5751,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"and fill with mortar the queer little box which hod-carriers use, and"
5752,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"bear it on his shoulders to the mason, who was fast laying the curved"
5753,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,wall.
5754,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5755,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Why do you have the wall laid in this rounding shape, papa?"" asked"
5756,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"George. ""Why not have it straight?"""
5757,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5758,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Because the curve makes it stronger to resist the force of the water."
5759,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,You notice that the mason chooses stones which are larger at one end
5760,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,than at the other. He lays them so that the larger ends form the outer
5761,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"side of the curve--the smaller form the inner or shorter side, as you"
5762,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"see by looking at this wall. The stones, thus wedged against each"
5763,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"other, could not be as easily forced out of place as if they were"
5764,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"square in shape, and laid in a straight line. Imagine the water"
5765,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,pressing upon the inner side of the curve. How readily the wall would
5766,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"give way, and the water come pouring through! Have you never observed,"
5767,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"children,"" continued Mr. Davy, ""that in bridges, culverts, or any"
5768,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"structure which is to sustain a heavy weight, the foundations are"
5769,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"always laid in the form of an arch?"""
5770,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5771,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Yes, papa,"" answered George; ""but I never knew why it was. I see now"
5772,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"that it is to make them strong."""
5773,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5774,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,The boys had quite enough of hod-carrying and stone-quarrying before
5775,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the wall was done. In fact, Patrick was pressed into the service"
5776,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,repeatedly. The hod became too uneasy a burden for the boys'
5777,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"shoulders, even though it was padded with sheep-skin."
5778,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5779,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,A channel to convey the water from the pond was now the only thing
5780,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"wanting. This was speedily begun, and the little workmen found"
5781,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,themselves down in a trench behind a low rampart of earth.
5782,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5783,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Let's play we are soldiers,"" said George. ""We'll have Patrick and"
5784,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Michael for captain and lieutenant (only they must work, if they _are_"
5785,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"officers), and papa for general and engineer."""
5786,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5787,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Each little soldier did his best. The officers worked faithfully. The
5788,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"engineer came round often, and the dark thread across the bright,"
5789,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,green meadow spun out rapidly.
5790,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5791,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Let's elect Frank quartermaster,"" said Tommy; ""then he'll go to"
5792,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"headquarters, and make requisition for rations. _I_ think it's time"

5803,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,all the boys.
5804,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5805,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Mamma was willing to issue rations in the field. ""But,"" said she,"

5809,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,This was a view of the case for which the boys were not prepared. They
5810,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"did not wish to seem unsoldierly, but they were very hungry."

5818,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,His brothers were quite ashamed that he should give this as a reason
5819,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"for wanting a good dinner, yet when they saw the pies and cakes going"
5820,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"into the basket, they made no remarks."
5821,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5822,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"While the quartermaster was at the house, Tommy and George had built a"
5823,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"fire, to boil the coffee. Two crotched stakes were driven firmly in"
5824,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the ground. A stout rod lay across them, and on this hung the kettle."
5825,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"A lively fire was burning underneath, the water boiling. In a few"
5826,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,moments the coffee was made.
5827,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5828,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"After washing carefully in the creek,--for everything must be done as"
5829,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"soldiers do,--all sat down in a circle on the ground. The coffee was"
5830,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,served in tin cups; but shall I confess that our soldiers were so
5831,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,unsoldierlike as to drink it with cream and sugar?
5832,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5833,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Patrick and Michael partook; but as they were absent directly
5834,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"afterwards, under pretence of smoking a noon pipe, I fancy they ate"
5835,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"still further rations in the farm-house kitchen. The boys, however,"
5836,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,said it was the best dinner they ever ate in their lives.
5837,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5838,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"They were now ready for a visit from the general. ""We will have these"
5839,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"breastworks,"" said he, ""smoothed down in regular shape, and sow"
5840,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"grass-seed upon them, so that in a few weeks there will be a green"
5841,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"slope in place of these unsightly clods."""
5842,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5843,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"I assure you that as I look from my window while writing this story,"
5844,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"those slopes appear very pretty, with the merry, sparkling stream"
5845,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,flowing between.
5846,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5847,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"But I must hasten; for you will be anxious to know that the pond,"
5848,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"gates, outlet, and all were done at last. Then came the day upon which"
5849,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the water was to be let in. A great day it was for the whole
5850,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,neighborhood. All the boys for a mile round were there to see.
5851,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5852,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"When everything was ready, Mr. Davy, who was up at the dam, hoisted"
5853,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the gate; the water came rushing through; in a few moments it had
5854,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"reached the end of its course, and poured over into the pond."
5855,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5856,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Such a shout as rose from the throats of the forty or fifty boys! It
5857,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,must have surprised those placid meadows and the great solemn rocks
5858,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,around. And you would have thought the sleepy old hills had actually
5859,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"been startled into life, such sounding echoes they sent back in"
5860,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,answer.
5861,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5862,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,The water spread itself thinly at first over the bottom of the pond.
5863,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Slowly it rose; the little hollows were filled up, the slight"
5864,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,elevations hidden from sight. Gradually it closed round the tiny green
5865,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,island which stood out above its surface like an emerald set in
5866,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,shining silver. By night the pond was full. The water began running
5867,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"over the top of the gate, making the prettiest little waterfall, and"
5868,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,over it a light spray rose softly towards the evening sky.
5869,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5870,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Bright and early the next morning there was commotion at the Davys'.
5871,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The boys were going to Maxwell's Creek, ten miles away, fishing. Mrs."
5872,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Davy was stirring round, preparing their lunch. George and Percy"
5873,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,hurried to the stable.
5874,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5875,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Come, Brown Billy,"" said Percy to the favorite pony; ""time to get up"
5876,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"and have your breakfast. We are all going fishing to-day;"" and he laid"
5877,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,his hand smartly upon the pony's back.
5878,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5879,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Brown Billy raised his head, opened his eyes in astonishment to see"
5880,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the boys so early in his stall; but hearing their merry voices, he"
5881,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"seemed to understand the situation at once, and to be in full sympathy"
5882,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"with them. An extra allowance of oats was put in the manger, and while"
5883,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the boys were eating their breakfast in the house, Brown Billy"
5884,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"leisurely munched his in the stable. Then, after a draught from the"
5885,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"pump, he was put into the traces. Two casks and a large basket were"
5886,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"lifted in, the luncheon deposited, and soon they were on their way."
5887,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The sun was just peeping above the horizon, spreading a crimson glory"
5888,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"over every hill, and tree, and shrub; but this was so familiar a sight"
5889,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"to the Davy boys, that it caused no remark, though they were not"
5890,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,insensible to its beauty.
5891,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5892,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The scene of their day's sport was a beautiful glen among the hills,"
5893,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"through which the stream, a genuine, untaught child of the woods,"
5894,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"jumped and tumbled at its own wild will, now leaping from precipices"
5895,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"in the loveliest cataracts, then fretting noisily over its stony bed,"
5896,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"and, a little farther on, flowing as smoothly as if it never thought"
5897,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,of foaming or fretting in all its course.
5898,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5899,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Tommy tied Brown Billy to a tree, giving him a long tether, that he"
5900,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,might pick at the fresh grass.
5901,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5902,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Trout are the most delicate of fishes, and require careful treatment."
5903,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Indeed, they are quite the aristocracy of the finny tribe. Mr. Davy"
5904,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,had given Patrick directions not to allow them to be caught with a
5905,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"hook, as it could not be taken from their mouths without causing much"
5906,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"pain, and perhaps death."
5907,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5908,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Patrick chose a place in the stream where the channel was narrow, but"
5909,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"deep, and waded in."
5910,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5911,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Now, boys,"" said he, ""yes all go above a little way, wade out into"
5912,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the sthrame, and bate the wather with yer fish-poles. This will drive"
5913,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"thim down, and I'll see what I can do wid the basket."""
5914,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5915,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The boys pulled off shoes and stockings, and rolled their trousers"
5916,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"above the knees. Clarence sat on the bank, paddling with his bare feet"
5917,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"in the stream. Stepping out into the creek, they hopped from one mossy"
5918,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"stone to another, the water pleasantly laving their feet. Standing in"
5919,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"a row across the stream, they began beating rather gently, at the same"
5920,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"time walking slowly forward, hoping to drive the fish before them."
5921,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Presently Patrick brought up the basket, the water streaming from it"
5922,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"as it did from Simple Simon's sieve, and in the bottom, wriggling and"
5923,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"squirming, lay four fine trout. Tommy seized the basket, and in an"
5924,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"instant the fish were within the cask, in their native element again,"
5925,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"though in rather close quarters. The boys hung over the barrel, gazing"
5926,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,at the pretty creatures with intense delight. The sun shone down into
5927,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the water, making the bright spots on their sides look like gold."
5928,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5929,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"""Never mind, little trout,"" said Franky; ""you are not going to be"
5930,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"hurt--only moved to our fish-pond."""
5931,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5932,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,Do you not think they enjoyed that day far more because there was no
5933,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,cruelty in their sport?
5934,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5935,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"Their amusement was varied by a delicious lunch, and an occasional"
5936,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"ramble through the woods. Towards evening they drove home, elated with"
5937,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,their success. The cask contained nearly as many fish as could swim.
5938,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The second cask was filled with fresh water, to replace that in the"
5939,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,first when it should no longer be fit for the use of the fish. These
5940,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"delicate little trout are so sensitive to any impurity, that they"
5941,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,could not have remained in the same water during the drive home
5942,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"without suffering. Indeed, they might have died before reaching the"
5943,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,pond.
5944,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5945,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,My young readers may not know that fish breathe an element of the
5946,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"water which is a part of air also. In fact, the same element which"
5947,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"sustains us sustains them also, viz., oxygen. Only one ninth part of"
5948,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"water, however, is oxygen, while of air it is one fifth. I dare say"
5949,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"you have all seen goldfishes, shut up in crystal prisons, swimming"
5950,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,their endless round in a quart or two of water. Perhaps you have
5951,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"observed them lifting their heads above the surface, mouths wide open,"
5952,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"gasping for breath. The oxygen is exhausted from the water, and unless"
5953,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,it be speedily changed their mistress will lose her beautiful pets.
5954,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5955,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"The trout were put into the pond--a small beginning, to be sure; but"
5956,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,it _was_ a beginning. How lonely they must have been at first! What a
5957,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,boundless ocean it must have seemed to them!
5958,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5959,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,We will hope they found some cosy harbor in the grassy-lined sides of
5960,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the island, where they could meet together and talk over their strange"
5961,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"experience of moving. Plenty of company came soon, however; for all"
5962,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the boys in the neighborhood were interested in stocking the pond.
5963,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5964,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,A boat was in progress in Mr. Davy's tool-house. The boys watched
5965,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"every inch of its growth, from the shaping of the skeleton frame to"
5966,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the last dash of the paint-brush. When it was done, the seats put"
5967,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"across from side to side, the coatings of white paint laid on, and"
5968,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"elevated upon four stakes to dry its glistening sides, the boys"
5969,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,thought nothing was ever half so beautiful; but when they saw it upon
5970,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"the pond, gently rocking from side to side, the oars hanging in the"
5971,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"locks, and lazily swaying to the motion of the water, it seemed to"
5972,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,them more beautiful still.
5973,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,
5974,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"This is not all a fancy sketch, dear boys and girls. Perhaps some of"
5975,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,the farmer children who read it may persuade their papas to make a
5976,THE DAVY BOYS' FISHING-POND.,"fishing-pond of some unsightly ""hollow in the pasture"" upon their own"

5989,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,A Newfoundland dog belonging to a gentleman in Edinburgh was in the
5990,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"habit of receiving a penny each day from his master, which he always"
5991,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,took to a baker's shop and bought a loaf of bread for himself. One day
5992,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,a bad penny was given him by a gentleman by way of frolic. Dandie ran
5993,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"off with it to the baker's, as usual, but was refused a loaf. The poor"
5994,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"dog waited a moment, as if considering what to do; he then returned to"
5995,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,the house of the gentleman who had given him the bad coin; and when
5996,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"the servant opened the door, he laid it at her feet and walked away"
5997,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,with an air of contempt.
5998,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,
5999,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"Some dogs are fond of music, while others seem not to be affected by"
6000,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,it in the slightest degree. These two anecdotes are related by the
6001,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"author of a recent volume. He is speaking of a friend: ""As soon as the"
6002,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"lamp is lighted and placed on the sitting-room table, a large dog of"
6003,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,the water-spaniel breed usually jumps up and curls himself around the
6004,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"lamp. He never upsets it, but remains perfectly still. Now, my friend"
6005,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"is very musical, but during the time the piano is being played the dog"
6006,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"remains perfectly unmoved, until a particular piece is played. He will"
6007,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"not take the slightest notice of loud or soft pieces, neither"
6008,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"sentimental nor comic, but instantly the old tune entitled 'Drops of"
6009,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"Brandy' is played, he invariably raises his head and begins to howl"
6010,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"most piteously, relapsing into his usual state of lethargy as soon as"
6011,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,this tune is stopped. My friend cannot account for this action of the
6012,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"dog in any way, nor can we learn from any source the reason of its"
6013,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,dislike.
6014,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,
6015,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"""Again, the wife of a hotel-keeper, lately deceased, possessed a pet"
6016,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,lap-dog which delighted in listening to its mistress playing on the
6017,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"piano; if the usual hour for her daily practice passed by, the dog"
6018,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"would grow impatient, snap and bark, and be perfectly uneasy until the"
6019,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,lady consented to gratify its wishes by sitting down to the instrument
6020,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,and playing a few tunes. During this operation the dog would sit
6021,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"motionless on a chair by her side; and when the music was ended, he"
6022,STORIES ABOUT DOGS.,"would jump down, quite satisfied for that day."""

6087,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","conversation; he said very little about the weather, and less about"
6088,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","things going on in the great world, and anything he did say on these"
6089,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","topics had almost to be coaxed out of him. However, he evidently took"
6090,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","great delight in giving all the family news, even to the most minute"

6092,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6093,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Of course you've heard,"" he said, warming one hand at the fire, ""that"

6097,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Yes; so I heard,"" said Mrs. Falkoner, pouring out another cup of tea,"

6101,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Not much,"" was the answer, and he again went back to the family news."
6102,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Jenny's got a baby,"" he said, suddenly, with great glee, as if this"
6103,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",piece of news was far before any other.
6104,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6105,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","This intelligence at least was news to Mrs. Falkoner, and she listened"

6107,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6108,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","But when Mrs. Falkoner was called away for a few minutes, it became"
6109,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",necessary for Archy to entertain the visitor till her return.
6110,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6111,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",Of course Archy had many questions to put about the railway and the
6112,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","engines, and dangers and catastrophes. John was excessively civil, and"
6113,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",on this subject was full of intelligence; but when he was asked if his
6114,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","own engine had broken down in the snow, he became quite horrified, if"
6115,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",not indignant.
6116,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6117,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""What, master, broke down?"" he said. ""Not a bit o't. I'd back the old"
6118,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","Bison against a drift twice as heavy. But, d'ye see, when you comes"
6119,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","and finds an engine and seven wagons o' minerals, and another engine,"
6120,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","and wagons besides that all ahead o' ye, and stuck fast, why, I says,"
6121,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",ye must give in. There ain't no use expecting yer engine to drive
6122,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","_through_ 'em, so must lie by till all's cleared, which won't be for"
6123,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","five hours at least."""
6124,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6125,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""How is it that the line's blocked up now?"" asked Archy. ""There has"
6126,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","been no more snow all day."""
6127,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6128,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Ay, that's true, master,"" said the engine-driver. ""But d'ye see, a"
6129,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","mile from the Junction there's a bit of heavy cutting, with a steep"
6130,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","sloping bank on either side. Now, this afternoon there was a slip;"
6131,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","most all the snow drifted there, and part of the bank itself fell in,"
6132,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","and so there is a block-up. As I said afore, the mineral train, she"
6133,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","comes up first, and she sticks fast, and then we has to follow, as a"
6134,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","matter in course. But had my old Bison been afront, he'd have done"
6135,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","differently, I make no doubt."""
6136,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6137,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Is your engine a much stronger one?"" said Archy, greatly amused to"
6138,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","hear how funny it was to call a train she, while he called the engine"
6139,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","he, and by an animal's name, too."
6140,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6141,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""It's not that he's stronger, sir, but he's got more go in him, has"
6142,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",the Bison. He's an extraordinary plucky engine. I've seen him do
6143,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","wonderful things when Mat Whitelaw was driver, and me stoker to 'em."
6144,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","I'll just tell you one on 'em, and then ye can judge what sort o'"
6145,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","stuff the Bison's made o'. It was one day in summer, some two years"
6146,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","ago; we had just taken in water at the junction, and were about to run"
6147,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","back to couple on the coaches, when an engine passed us tearing along"
6148,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","at a tremendous speed on the other line o' rail, but, mark me, without"
6149,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","a driver or stoker, or aught else on it. I thought my mate was mad,"
6150,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","when he got up steam, and off in the same direction; but in a moment"
6151,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",I saw what he was up to. The Bison was going in the chase. 'See to the
6152,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","brake, John,' was all Mat said, when off we were after the runaway at"
6153,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","full speed. It seemed to me nought but a wild-goose chase; for, d'ye"
6154,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","see, master, we were on another line o' rails altogether. But Mat knew"
6155,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","what he was about, and it was my place to do his bidding. I was always"
6156,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","proud o' the old Bison before that morning, but I never knew till then"
6157,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","what a good engine was, and what was depending on it."
6158,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6159,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""You would have thought he fairly snorted to his work, going at the"
6160,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","rate o' forty miles an hour we were, and at last we got abreast o' the"
6161,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","runaway engine, and could have passed him, but that would have been"
6162,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",useless. There wasn't another driver on the whole line would have
6163,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","thought of the thing so quickly as Mat did, nor could have regulated"
6164,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",the speed so nicely to a moment. The two different engines were
6165,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","running just opposite each other on the two different lines, the"
6166,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","runaway being a good deal worn out now, and going much slower than at"
6167,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","first, when Mat he says to me, hoarsely, 'Jump across. It'll be safer"
6168,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","if I stick here to hold the regulator; but I'll go, if you'd rather"
6169,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","stay.' I had such confidence in Mat Whitelaw, that I could trust my"
6170,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","life with him before any mortal man; and the instant he gave the word,"
6171,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","I jumped, and did it safe. We each put on our brakes, and took breath,"
6172,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","and desperately hot we both were, I can assure you."""
6173,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6174,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Were you not terribly afraid?"" said Archy, who had been almost"
6175,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",breathless during the recital.
6176,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6177,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""I can't say that we were,"" said John, coolly; ""but I'll tell you I"
6178,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","was frightened enough the next moment, when Mat looked at his watch,"
6179,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",and sees that the down express was due in a few minutes on his line. I
6180,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",believe that Mat thought more o' the passengers that might be
6181,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","smashed, and the risk for the Bison, than o' his own safety. He said"
6182,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","it would never do to reverse the engines now; but if we kept on, he"
6183,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",thought there might yet be time to run into the siding at the nearest
6184,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","station. So on we went once more at increased speed, straight on"
6185,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","ahead, though it was like running into the very face of the danger."
6186,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","The telegraph had been hard at work, and the station people had been"
6187,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","laying their heads together, and they were at the points. So, when"
6188,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","they heard the whistle, and saw Mat putting on the brake, they at once"
6189,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","opened the points,--not a moment too soon, I can tell you,--and in he"
6190,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","ran into the siding. Now, what Mat did, sir, was what I call about"
6191,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","equal to most generals in war, and as great a benefit to society."""
6192,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6193,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""He must be a brave fellow,"" said Archy; ""and I hope you were both"

6195,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6196,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""The company behaved very handsome,"" was the answer. ""Mat got on to"

6214,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","""Well, 'cept it be to tell you how I got to be driver of the Bison"
6215,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","myself, it's not worth the listening to. When Mat left, Bill Jones got"
6216,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",to be my mate--the worst driver on the line; at least he couldn't
6217,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","manage the Bison. He did not understand that engine one bit, and was"
6218,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","constantly getting into trouble, till I was driven almost wild. Bill"
6219,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","would say, 'Bison, indeed! he ought to be called Donkey; it would suit"
6220,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","his kicking ways better.' It was quite true he kicked, but he never"
6221,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","did it with Mat on him, and went along the rails as smooth as oil."
6222,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","Well, at one part o' the line, there is a gradual long incline, and"
6223,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","one day we were just putting on more steam to run up, when we sees at"
6224,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",the top two or three coaches coming tearing down straight upon us. We
6225,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","knew there was a heavy excursion train on ahead, and we had been going"
6226,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","rather slow on that account, and this was some of the coaches that had"
6227,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","got uncoupled from the rest. Well, Bill, my mate, no sooner saw it"
6228,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","coming, than says he, 'Jump for your life!' and out he went. But I"
6229,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","knew what a quick engine the Bison was, and, moreover, I saw our guard"
6230,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","had noticed the danger, too, and would work with me; so I reversed"
6231,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","the engine, and ran back, until the coaches came up to us, but did no"
6232,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",further damage save giving us a bit of a shake as they struck on the
6233,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",old Bison; and so we drove them afore us right up to the station. Bill
6234,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","was killed, as might have been expected, for he had no faith in the"
6235,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","Bison whatever; and so the company, they came to see I understood that"

6237,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""",
6238,"JOHN STOCKS AND ""THE BISON.""","Archy now bade the worthy engine-driver good night, saying that he"

6311,PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.,
6312,QUE.,QUE.
6313,QUE.,
6314,QUE.,
6315,QUE.,He was a wee bit of a boy to carry the United States mail on his
6316,QUE.,"back, seven miles, every day. He was only eleven years old, and as"
6317,QUE.,"long, to an inch, as the mail bag, which was just three feet and"
6318,QUE.,"eleven inches long. When he went along the road, you would sometimes"
6319,QUE.,"see him, and sometimes the bag; that was as you happened to be on this"
6320,QUE.,or the other side of him. Many persons' hard hearts have been made to
6321,QUE.,"open a crevice, at sight of the little fellow, to let a little jet of"
6322,QUE.,"pity spirt out for him. But ""The Point"" ran out three miles and a half"
6323,QUE.,"to the south of the county road and the stage coach, and the nearest"
6324,QUE.,"coach post-office; and because it was only a small point, and sparsely"
6325,QUE.,"settled, it couldn't afford a horse for the short distance; and"
6326,QUE.,"because it was a short distance, no man, or boy, who was able to do a"
6327,QUE.,"full day's work, would break into it to walk the seven miles; and"
6328,QUE.,"because it was seven miles, no one who was not well could walk so far"
6329,QUE.,"every day, and the year round. So it happened that the job was up for"
6330,QUE.,"bids one spring, and the person who would carry the mail from Gingoo"
6331,QUE.,"to the Point for the smallest amount of money, was to have it for a"
6332,QUE.,year.
6333,QUE.,
6334,QUE.,One woman offered to carry it for eighty dollars; another for seventy;
6335,QUE.,one big boy offered for sixty-five; he'd make the girls at home do the
6336,QUE.,"work, he said,--they hadn't anything else to do,--and he would give"
6337,QUE.,"them each a new ribbon to pay for it: and between you and me, I am"
6338,QUE.,very glad that that boy didn't get the job.
6339,QUE.,
6340,QUE.,"Without saying a word to his family about it, Que made up his mind"
6341,QUE.,that he would carry the mail himself. When the others sent in their
6342,QUE.,"bids he sent in his, for fifty dollars. _So_ it happened that Que was"
6343,QUE.,"mail-carrier. He was so little and bow-legged, that there were not"
6344,QUE.,"many things that he could do; for instance, he couldn't run. His head"
6345,QUE.,"and feet were very large, and his arms and intermediate body very"
6346,QUE.,small; therefore he could dream and wonder what he should do when he
6347,QUE.,"grew up, and walk (with care) as much as he pleased, but was not a"
6348,QUE.,favorite among the boys in playing games.
6349,QUE.,
6350,QUE.,"Of course he was not baptized into the name Que, but was called, by"
6351,QUE.,"his parents and the christening minister, John Quincy Adams Pond, Jr.;"
6352,QUE.,"named for his father, you see. They began to call him Que before he"
6353,QUE.,"was out of his babyhood; for they had one boy named John Lee, but as"
6354,QUE.,"they always called him Lee, they entirely forgot that fact till after"
6355,QUE.,the ceremony of Que's christening. And they really weren't much to
6356,QUE.,"blame, for they had nine other boys, and poor memories; and though"
6357,QUE.,"both are misfortunes, they can't be helped. To avoid mixing their two"
6358,QUE.,"Johns, they called one Lee and the other Que."
6359,QUE.,
6360,QUE.,"Que looked upon seven miles a day as no walk at all, and upon fifty"
6361,QUE.,"dollars a year as a fortune, and upon ""United States mail-carrier"" as"
6362,QUE.,"a title little below ""Hon."" or ""Esq."" He had hoped, all his life, that"
6363,QUE.,"he should, some fine day, have a right to one or the other of these"
6364,QUE.,"titles. Probably the fact that his name already ended with a ""Jr."""
6365,QUE.,excited his ambition in that particular direction. Money and dignity
6366,QUE.,"seemed to Que the two things most to be desired in life, unless I"
6367,QUE.,might add a small family.
6368,QUE.,
6369,QUE.,"Now, we will leave Que's antecedents behind, and go on to his life"
6370,QUE.,"while he carried the mail; and a very queer little life it was, as you"
6371,QUE.,"will say when you get to the end of it, though I don't know when that"
6372,QUE.,"will be, for Que isn't there himself yet. The mail contract was from"
6373,QUE.,"July 1, 1860, to July 1, 1861, and if your mathematics are in good"
6374,QUE.,"running order, you will see that that was just a year."
6375,QUE.,
6376,QUE.,"July 1, 1860, was as fine a day in Gingoo as any day in the year; and"
6377,QUE.,Que was in as high spirits as on any day in the course of his life.
6378,QUE.,Unfortunately the mail coach reached Gingoo exactly at forty minutes
6379,QUE.,"past eleven, unless the driver got drunk or fell asleep, which"
6380,QUE.,happened about two hundred and forty days in the year. But whether
6381,QUE.,"sober, drunk, or asleep, the four coach horses always stood before"
6382,QUE.,Gingoo office door by twelve o'clock at latest.
6383,QUE.,
6384,QUE.,It makes no difference to you or to me when the coach stood there; but
6385,QUE.,"it made a great deal of difference to Que, for twelve o'clock on the"
6386,QUE.,"finest day in the year, and that day the first of July, is apt to be"
6387,QUE.,"rather warm; and in the year 1860 it was _very_ warm. Nevertheless, at"
6388,QUE.,"quarter past twelve, Que started with the bag. I, happening to be at"
6389,QUE.,"the right side of him, saw only the bag start with Que."
6390,QUE.,
6391,QUE.,Perhaps you don't see why Que should have started right in the heat of
6392,QUE.,"the day; but if you had been Que, and could have heard all the"
6393,QUE.,"Pointers clamoring for their mail, you would have started just when"
6394,QUE.,"Que did. The mail-bag was made of very dark leather, and drew the sun"
6395,QUE.,"tremendously. Now, as Que had on a pair of light linen pants and a"
6396,QUE.,"little gray lined coat, of course he ought to have walked between the"
6397,QUE.,"bag and the sun; but not being a scientific boy, he didn't think of"
6398,QUE.,"that, and slung the bag over his sunny shoulder, and from that height"
6399,QUE.,it trailed to the ground.
6400,QUE.,
6401,QUE.,"Que walked on as fast as he could, trying not to think too much of the"
6402,QUE.,heat and the weight; but the peculiar odor that the sun brought from
6403,QUE.,"the leather bag was blown up his nose, and down his throat, and into"
6404,QUE.,"his ears, by a strong south wind that blew, and before Que had time to"
6405,QUE.,"think whether he had better or better not, he was lying fast asleep by"
6406,QUE.,"the side of the road, on the grass; rather he was lying on the"
6407,QUE.,"mail-bag, and that was lying on the grass. Why didn't he fall on the"
6408,QUE.,"other side? For two reasons; first, he was attracted mail-bag way by"
6409,QUE.,"the sleepy odor before spoken of; and secondly, the weight was all"
6410,QUE.,"that way, and as he began to sleep before he began to drop, of course"
6411,QUE.,the bag was his natural bed when he did drop.
6412,QUE.,
6413,QUE.,"The Point road was lonesome, and it must have been quite an hour"
6414,QUE.,"before any one came that way. Then a man and two horses, and a cart"
6415,QUE.,"loaded high with laths, were seen coming over the hill; that is, they"
6416,QUE.,"would have been seen, if Que hadn't been asleep just then."
6417,QUE.,
6418,QUE.,"""Hollo! what's all this?"" said the driver when he got opposite the bag"
6419,QUE.,and Que.
6420,QUE.,
6421,QUE.,"""All this"" neither stirred nor spoke."
6422,QUE.,
6423,QUE.,"""Whoa! whoa, there!"" called the driver to his horses."
6424,QUE.,
6425,QUE.,"Now, if Que had been taking only a light, after-dinner nap, he would"
6426,QUE.,have been wide awake as soon as the cart stopped; for the hill was a
6427,QUE.,"long one, and the rumbling had been as long, and merely from lack of"
6428,QUE.,"that lullaby, a well-conditioned boy should have wakened at once. But"
6429,QUE.,Que didn't.
6430,QUE.,
6431,QUE.,"""I declare,"" said the driver, ""if it ain't that bran new mail-boy!"""
6432,QUE.,Thereupon he went up and looked at him; but not being of a magnetic
6433,QUE.,"temperament, he didn't wake Que that way."
6434,QUE.,
6435,QUE.,"""Bless the chick, if he isn't dead asleep,"" continued the driver,"
6436,QUE.,"talking to himself. This driver had a habit of talking to himself, for"
6437,QUE.,"he said, ""then he was always sure of having somebody worth talking"
6438,QUE.,"to."""
6439,QUE.,
6440,QUE.,"""Now, won't those Pointers growl for their mail, when it is a couple"
6441,QUE.,"of hours late? The first day, too! Que'll catch it."" Then he gave Que"
6442,QUE.,"a little roll, so that he rolled from the bag over into the grass."
6443,QUE.,
6444,QUE.,"""Well, I always _was_ a good-natured fellow. Guess I'll take his bag"
6445,QUE.,"along for him, and save him the scolding."""
6446,QUE.,
6447,QUE.,"So the driver threw the bag on top of the load of laths, and left the"
6448,QUE.,bag-boy to sleep it out.
6449,QUE.,
6450,QUE.,"When Que had slept half an hour longer, he started up, staring wide"
6451,QUE.,awake.
6452,QUE.,
6453,QUE.,"""I've been asleep,"" said Que; and so he had."
6454,QUE.,
6455,QUE.,"""My bag's been and gone,"" continued Que; and so it had."
6456,QUE.,
6457,QUE.,"But he was a bright boy, and all the brighter, perhaps, for having"
6458,QUE.,"just been asleep; so he looked round, which is a very good thing to do"
6459,QUE.,"when you get into trouble, and the very thing that half the people in"
6460,QUE.,the world never think to do.
6461,QUE.,
6462,QUE.,"""There are tracks in the grass; and there is a cart-track in the dust,"
6463,QUE.,"and it had two horses, and these foot-tracks went back to it. Why, the"
6464,QUE.,"lath man must have taken it;"" and so he had."
6465,QUE.,
6466,QUE.,"Que started towards the Point as fast as he could go, and"
6467,QUE.,"consequently, when he got there, which was just fifty minutes after"
6468,QUE.,"the bag got there, he had no breath left to ask any questions about"
6469,QUE.,it. Still he panted on to the post-office.
6470,QUE.,
6471,QUE.,"""Who are you?"" asked the postmaster."
6472,QUE.,
6473,QUE.,"""I'm--a--bag,"" gasped Que."
6474,QUE.,
6475,QUE.,"""Bag of wind!"" said the postmaster, emphatically."
6476,QUE.,
6477,QUE.,"""A--mail--bag!"" said Que."
6478,QUE.,
6479,QUE.,"""Humph! So you're the new mail boy--are you? Send your bag down by"
6480,QUE.,"express, and came yourself by accommodation--didn't you?"""
6481,QUE.,
6482,QUE.,"""The lath man's got it; where is he?"" Que had recovered his breath a"
6483,QUE.,little by this time.
6484,QUE.,
6485,QUE.,"""I don't know anything about the lath man,"" growled the postmaster."
6486,QUE.,
6487,QUE.,"But when Que began to cry, which he did at once, the postmaster"
6488,QUE.,"couldn't stand that, for he had no children of his own, and his"
6489,QUE.,"feelings, consequently, weren't hardened; so he dragged the bag from"
6490,QUE.,"a corner, and threw it on Que's back."
6491,QUE.,
6492,QUE.,"""There, take your bag, and go home, and don't be two hours late the"
6493,QUE.,"first day, next time."" He didn't stop to think that there cannot be"
6494,QUE.,"two first days to the same thing. Que didn't stop to think of it,"
6495,QUE.,"either, but started homewards as fast as his bow-legs would let him. I"
6496,QUE.,"think he approximated more nearly to running, that day, than he ever"
6497,QUE.,had done in his life before.
6498,QUE.,
6499,QUE.,"Que's nine brothers treated him with great respect, when he got home."
6500,QUE.,"The family had been to tea, but each one had saved some part of his"
6501,QUE.,"supper for Que; so, though he had an indigestible mixture, there was"
6502,QUE.,"plenty of it,--while it lasted."
6503,QUE.,
6504,QUE.,"""Did you have a good time, Que?"""
6505,QUE.,
6506,QUE.,"""Was it fun?"""
6507,QUE.,
6508,QUE.,"""Did you get anything for it?"""
6509,QUE.,
6510,QUE.,"""Did you get tired?"""
6511,QUE.,
6512,QUE.,"""Going to keep it up?"""
6513,QUE.,
6514,QUE.,"""Can't I go next time?"""
6515,QUE.,
6516,QUE.,"""Do you like it?"""
6517,QUE.,
6518,QUE.,"""Did you see any boys?"""
6519,QUE.,
6520,QUE.,"""Anybody give you a lift?"""
6521,QUE.,
6522,QUE.,How all together the questions did come! But the confusion of them
6523,QUE.,"saved Que from the trouble of answering the nine boys, and as soon as"
6524,QUE.,"there was a lull, his father said,--"
6525,QUE.,
6526,QUE.,"""You were gone some time, sir; I hope you didn't stop to play on the"
6527,QUE.,"road?"""
6528,QUE.,
6529,QUE.,"""O, no, sir,"" said Que. ""I haven't played at all;"" which was very"
6530,QUE.,"true, you know."
6531,QUE.,
6532,QUE.,"""Did there seem to be many letters?"" asked his mother; and be it"
6533,QUE.,"understood, that she asked quite as much because Que looked as if the"
6534,QUE.,"bag had been heavy, as from feminine curiosity."
6535,QUE.,
6536,QUE.,"""Didn't notice, ma'am; the bag wasn't very heavy;"" and it wasn't,"
6537,QUE.,"except on his conscience, and he knew his mother didn't mean that, at"
6538,QUE.,all.
6539,QUE.,
6540,QUE.,For several weeks after that everything went on smoothly enough. Que
6541,QUE.,"had a pretty good time, and found it some fun, and felt that he was"
6542,QUE.,"getting something for it, and didn't get very tired, and kept it up,"
6543,QUE.,"and never took any of his brothers with him, and liked the business,"
6544,QUE.,"and saw a good many boys, and got a large number of ""lifts"" from"
6545,QUE.,"hay-carts and wagons, and particularly from the lath man. So, in"
6546,QUE.,"course of time, all the brothers' questions were satisfactorily"
6547,QUE.,answered.
6548,QUE.,
6549,QUE.,"It is a way that the world has, to let you trip once, and then run on"
6550,QUE.,"smooth ground some time, before it puts another snag in your way; and"
6551,QUE.,it made no exception in Que's favor. His drab clothes kept clean a
6552,QUE.,"long time, in spite of the leather bag, and washed well when they were"
6553,QUE.,"not clean. The Gingoo postmaster took a fancy to him, and the Point"
6554,QUE.,post master refrained from tormenting him. The mails were not
6555,QUE.,unbearably heavy nor the month of July remarkably hot after the first.
6556,QUE.,"Que had a good appetite for his supper, and plenty of supper to show"
6557,QUE.,"it on, and slept long and heavily every night and a part of every"
6558,QUE.,"morning, and thought that the world was a pretty good kind of place,"
6559,QUE.,after all. But that was only because he hadn't come to the second snag
6560,QUE.,yet.
6561,QUE.,
6562,QUE.,"One day, in the first end of August, a wind sprang up. It wasn't a"
6563,QUE.,"very uncommonly high wind, only no one was expecting it, because the"
6564,QUE.,"days had been muggy, and that made every one say, ""Why, what a high"
6565,QUE.,"wind there is to-day!"""
6566,QUE.,
6567,QUE.,You and I can't tell why the wind should have gone on rising through
6568,QUE.,"the forenoon; but we can guess, which will answer our purpose just as"
6569,QUE.,well; for you know it is but little more than that that your father
6570,QUE.,"and his friends, and father's father and his friends, do, when they"
6571,QUE.,"meet together and ""express opinions."""
6572,QUE.,
6573,QUE.,"_I_ guess that the wind rose higher through the forenoon because, as"
6574,QUE.,"soon as it began to play about in the morning, it caught the whisper"
6575,QUE.,"of people's surprise, and thought it would take the hint, and blow"
6576,QUE.,them up a little.
6577,QUE.,
6578,QUE.,"""What a dickens of a wind!"" said Que, when he stood, or tried to"
6579,QUE.,"stand, on top of the hill with his bag."
6580,QUE.,
6581,QUE.,Que had learned all the easy ways of carrying that bag long ago; of
6582,QUE.,strapping it in a little roll over his shoulders when it wasn't very
6583,QUE.,full; of carrying it on his head when it had enough inside to balance
6584,QUE.,"just right, and of strapping it round his body when it had nothing in"
6585,QUE.,"it. But, as the days had been all stormless alike, he had been obliged"
6586,QUE.,"to adapt himself only to the conditions of the bag, and not at all to"
6587,QUE.,the state of the weather.
6588,QUE.,
6589,QUE.,"As the masculine mind is capable of taking in only one idea at a time,"
6590,QUE.,"as soon as Que put his mind to the state of the weather, it drew"
6591,QUE.,itself away from the manner of carrying the bag.
6592,QUE.,
6593,QUE.,"""Wish I had something between me and the wind,"" sighed he."
6594,QUE.,
6595,QUE.,"Just then the wind blew off his hat, to teach him the polite order of"
6596,QUE.,"mentioning two persons, of whom himself was one."
6597,QUE.,
6598,QUE.,"Que followed after it as fast as he could, and let the bag drop beside"
6599,QUE.,"him, and by chance it hung from his neck to the windward side."
6600,QUE.,
6601,QUE.,The wind blew very strong.
6602,QUE.,
6603,QUE.,"""I do declare,"" said he, ""I shouldn't wonder a bit if the wind blew me"
6604,QUE.,"away."""
6605,QUE.,
6606,QUE.,"Que was a truthful boy; but he did wonder very much when he found, two"
6607,QUE.,"seconds afterwards, that the wind _was_ blowing him away. But he"
6608,QUE.,"didn't wonder at all, when he lay, a minute later, against a huge"
6609,QUE.,apple tree; partly because people generally get through wondering when
6610,QUE.,"they are at the end of anything, but mostly because the blow stunned"
6611,QUE.,"Que, so that he didn't know anything for an hour."
6612,QUE.,
6613,QUE.,"When he gradually came to himself, he didn't know where he was. Then a"
6614,QUE.,"little wind shook a green apple down on his nose, and he concluded"
6615,QUE.,that he was under an apple tree; which was quite correct.
6616,QUE.,
6617,QUE.,Then he looked about to see whether he was in the United States or
6618,QUE.,"not; he saw the five juniper trees that had been standing in a row,"
6619,QUE.,"half a mile from his father's house, ever since he could remember, and"
6620,QUE.,concluded that he must be; wherein he was again quite correct.
6621,QUE.,
6622,QUE.,"Then he wondered if any one would come for him, for he felt so stiff"
6623,QUE.,and sore that he thought he never could go home alone.
6624,QUE.,
6625,QUE.,"""They'll come for me, _I_ know; for if I've had a gale they must have"
6626,QUE.,had one; and if they have had one they'll know that I've had one. Of
6627,QUE.,"course they'll come."""
6628,QUE.,
6629,QUE.,"Que felt round for his mail-bag, and got his head on it, and waited."
6630,QUE.,While he was lying there it occurred to him that the people down in
6631,QUE.,the village wouldn't have been walking about with bags broader than
6632,QUE.,"themselves to windward of them, and mightn't have felt the breeze as"
6633,QUE.,he did; so his last reasoning wasn't correct at all.
6634,QUE.,
6635,QUE.,"""I'll bet they didn't feel it a bit!"" thought Que; and by this time he"
6636,QUE.,"was so fully in possession of his original faculties, that his"
6637,QUE.,reasoning was quite correct again. No one else had felt the gale.
6638,QUE.,
6639,QUE.,"Que put his head on the bag and thought that his end had come, and so"
6640,QUE.,cried himself to sleep.
6641,QUE.,
6642,QUE.,"His family had not felt the gale very heavily; but when tea-time came,"
6643,QUE.,"and Que didn't, they felt that; and when darkness came, and Que"
6644,QUE.,"didn't, they felt that; and when a report came, with a growl, from"
6645,QUE.,"the Point that they wanted their mail, Que's father started out with a"
6646,QUE.,lantern to find it.
6647,QUE.,
6648,QUE.,"Que, having finished his nap, felt better, and tried to get up; but"
6649,QUE.,his ankle didn't want to move; and when he tried again it actually
6650,QUE.,wouldn't move; so he lay down again to wait and watch. When he saw the
6651,QUE.,"lantern go by, he called, and his father came."
6652,QUE.,
6653,QUE.,"""What are you doing here, sir?"""
6654,QUE.,
6655,QUE.,"""Nothing,"" said Que."
6656,QUE.,
6657,QUE.,"""Get up, then."""
6658,QUE.,
6659,QUE.,"""I can't,"" said Que."
6660,QUE.,
6661,QUE.,"""You've been asleep, sir."""
6662,QUE.,
6663,QUE.,"""Yes, sir,"" said Que."
6664,QUE.,
6665,QUE.,"""What have you done with the mail-bag?"""
6666,QUE.,
6667,QUE.,"""It is the mail-bag that's done with me,"" said Que."
6668,QUE.,
6669,QUE.,"Then his father took him by the collar, and stood him up, and saw at"
6670,QUE.,once what was the matter. Que had sprained his ankle.
6671,QUE.,
6672,QUE.,"It seemed to Que, during the next four weeks, as if that ankle never"
6673,QUE.,"would heal; but it did at last, and John Lee, who had carried the mail"
6674,QUE.,"in the mean time, was loath to give the job to Que again. He felt for"
6675,QUE.,"Que through his pain, but charged him one twelfth of fifty dollars for"
6676,QUE.,"doing his work a month, and would like to do it a while longer."
6677,QUE.,
6678,QUE.,There isn't much more to tell of Que as a mail-boy. The end of the
6679,QUE.,year found him the possessor of forty-five dollars and five shillings.
6680,QUE.,
6681,QUE.,"The next year the Point afforded a horse, and Que took the mail on the"
6682,QUE.,"horse's back; the year following they had a horse and wagon, and Que"
6683,QUE.,drove that; when they have a railway I have no doubt Que will be a
6684,QUE.,"conductor; and when the mail is blown through a tunnel, Que, of"
6685,QUE.,"course, will blow it."
6686,QUE.,
6687,QUE.,"Even the second snag, you see, needn't lay you a dead weight on the"
6688,QUE.,earth.

6774,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"pages; they had a new writing-master, and wrote with their faces"
6775,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"turned a new way, to the great disgust of Will. They had had a botany"
6776,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"excursion to Blue Hills, which he had lost. He was down at the foot of"
6777,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"the class, and at the end of the morning he had made up his desperate"
6778,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,mind to remain there forever. It was no use for a fellow to try to put
6779,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,through such a pile of back lessons.
6780,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6781,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"He came stamping up stairs, kicked at the nursery door, slung in his"
6782,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"bag of books, and stood on the threshold, pouting and glaring angrily"
6783,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,at his sister Emily.
6784,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6785,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Emily sat in the window opposite, the sunlight sifting through the"
6786,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,flickering ivy leaves on to her golden hair and fair sweet face. She
6787,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,was singing over her sewing as Will made his noisy entrance. She
6788,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"looked up at the scowling boy in the doorway, her pale cheeks flushing"
6789,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,with surprise and then with pity.
6790,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6791,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""What's the matter?"" she asked, gently."
6792,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6793,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Matter?"" roared Will; ""I guess you'd ask, if you knew how old 'Crit'"
6794,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"had been cramming the fellows, and me nowhere. I'll--run away to sea,"
6795,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"or somewheres. I'm not going to _stand_ it."""
6796,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6797,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will bounced his hand down so hard on a tea-poy, two little terra"
6798,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"cotta shepherdesses bounded up from it, knocked their heads together,"
6799,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and fell clattering to the floor.
6800,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6801,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""O, Will,"" cried Emily, rising up with a scared face, and dropping her"
6802,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"pretty work-basket, ""don't talk so. You are tired now, and everything"
6803,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"troubles you, because you have been sick so long. By and by, when you"
6804,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"are a little stronger, you will feel differently. Don't think about"
6805,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,the back lessons. Just try to be glad you are well enough to go to
6806,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"school again, and be with the boys."""
6807,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6808,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""O, don't preach!"" persisted Will, gruffly."
6809,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6810,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"With the cloud still hanging over his handsome face, he shook himself"
6811,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"away from the caressing hand which was laid upon his shoulder, as if"
6812,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"to hold him back from running away to the great, pitiless sea."
6813,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6814,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Asy! asy, now!"""
6815,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6816,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"This was Kathleen, the nurse, calling out in cautioning tones to Will,"
6817,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,who had jerked against the tray she was carrying causing the two
6818,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"saucers of strawberries to click together sharply, and the buttered"
6819,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,rolls to slip over the edge of the plate.
6820,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6821,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""You're tired with the school, poor craythur, an' no wonder at that"
6822,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"same. Larnin's murtherin', bad luck to it! I tried it mysel oncet, a"
6823,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"moonth or so, avenin's. It's myself was watchin' for ye, Master Will,"
6824,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and when ye came round the corner I had this bit sup arl ready for ye.
6825,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"'The crame--quick--Bridget!' says I, and then I ran away up the two"
6826,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"flights with it; and barrin' the joggle you give it, it's in foine,"
6827,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"tip-top orther an' priservation arl tegither, bless your little sowl!"""
6828,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6829,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Kathleen set out the crisp little rolls and the great crimson berries
6830,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"in the most tempting way she could devise, and went off, bobbing her"
6831,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"head with satisfaction to see the children place themselves at table,"
6832,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and partake of her well-timed lunch.
6833,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6834,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will, as an atonement for the ungentle way in which he had come in"
6835,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"upon his sister after school, offered her the nicest plate of berries,"
6836,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and insisted that she should take the crispiest roll. He suddenly
6837,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"remembered that Emily, too, had had whooping-cough and measles at the"
6838,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"same time, and quite as badly as himself. But, then, she had not"
6839,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,sprained her wrist or lamed her foot; so it was no wonder her temper
6840,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"had not suffered. Besides, it was expected of girls not to make a"
6841,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,fuss.
6842,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6843,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"In view of these last circumstances, he suppressed the apology he was"
6844,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,about to make for his late unpleasant remarks.
6845,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6846,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""It never will do to give up too much to girls,"" he reasoned, draining"
6847,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,the last drop of cream from the pitcher.
6848,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6849,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Your grandmamma is coming over from Brookline this afternoon in the"
6850,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"carriage, to take the two of you home with her to spind the night."""
6851,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6852,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"This was Kathleen back again at the nursery door, and wiping her face"
6853,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,with her apron as she unburdened herself of this forgotten bit of
6854,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,news.
6855,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6856,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""You won't run away to sea now,"" besought Emily, with imploring eyes."
6857,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6858,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Maybe I mightn't,"" shouted Will, tossing up his cap in glee at this"
6859,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,unexpected prospect of fun.
6860,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6861,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,It was now only the middle of the long summer day. Such a tiresome
6862,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,journey as the sun had to go before it rolled quite away in the west!
6863,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will longed to give it a push, and to hurry up the clock to strike"
6864,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"five, the hour when they should be on their way to beautiful"
6865,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Brookline.
6866,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6867,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Impatient little Will! Emily kindly helped him to get through with the
6868,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"lagging time. At her suggestion, he played ball a while on the lawn,"
6869,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,while from time to time she nodded encouragingly to him through the
6870,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"open window. By and by the ball bounded up into a spout, cuddling down"
6871,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"among some soft old maple leaves, where Will could not see it."
6872,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Thereupon Will came into the house in a great pet, storming about till"
6873,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,he was persuaded to sit on the floor and paste pictures in his
6874,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,scrap-book.
6875,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6876,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"This quiet occupation did not amuse him long. His fingers, his chin,"
6877,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"his cheeks, his curls even soon became stiff with mucilage. Mucilage"
6878,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"on his trouser knees, mucilage on his jacket elbows--in fact, mucilage"
6879,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,everywhere on and around him.
6880,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6881,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Emily, after having, with great painstaking, washed her brother and"
6882,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"all the surrounding furniture, proposed that he should study a Latin"
6883,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"lesson. The book soon went down with a bang. ""Because,"" as Will"
6884,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"sulkily explained to his sighing sister, ""it made his head buzz."""
6885,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6886,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Emily gently suggested a French lesson as a corrective of this
6887,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"unpleasant ""buzz."" The remedy soon proved to be a failure. The French"
6888,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,book came down more noisily than the Latin book.
6889,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6890,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Emily laid aside her drawing in despair. It was such a relief to hear
6891,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Kathleen's heavy step in the entry, and to remember it was time now"
6892,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,for Will to be dressed for dinner!
6893,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6894,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Poor Kathleen had a thankless task before her. Master Will required a
6895,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,great deal of preparation. His curls were gummed and tangled; his
6896,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"fingers were inky, and suspiciously pitchy."
6897,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6898,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""You've been climbin' unknownst up that pine tree again, an' you a"
6899,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"told not to?"" questioned Kathleen, examining the fingers keenly."
6900,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6901,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Hush up, and go ahead!"" was Will's rude answer."
6902,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6903,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""How _can_ you speak so?"" reproved Emily, turning round upon Will,"
6904,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,while she tied back her hair with a band of blue ribbon.
6905,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6906,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Fie, fie, sir!"" cried displeased Kathleen, ""going ahead"" with great"
6907,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"energy, her mouth pursed up in disapproval of Master Will's manners,"
6908,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"while she washed, and combed, and curled, and took off and put on his"
6909,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,apparel.
6910,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6911,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Where's your stockings, Master Will,--the blue stripes?"""
6912,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6913,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Dunno."""
6914,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6915,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will sat in a low chair, his stubby bare feet stuck out before him,"
6916,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and his two hands actively employed as fly-catchers. Suddenly he
6917,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,remembered having amused himself the day before in oiling his sled
6918,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"runners, using the striped stockings for wipers; but he did not"
6919,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,trouble Kathleen just then with the tidings. The blue-striped
6920,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,stockings were not found. Then came a difficulty with his new boots.
6921,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6922,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Aow! they pinch!"""
6923,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6924,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Where, sir?"""
6925,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6926,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Master Will, not being able to say exactly where, was left to get used"
6927,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,to the new boots as well as he could.
6928,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6929,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Now see, here's your new suit; an' be careful with it, mind--careful"
6930,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,as iver was. It's me afternoon out; and if ye go tearin' the cloos on
6931,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"ye, ye'll jist mind thim yersel, or else go in tatthers wid yer"
6932,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"grandmamma."""
6933,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6934,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,This speech had no more wholesome effect on Will than to cause him to
6935,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"stick out his tongue at Emily, while Kathleen, standing behind him,"
6936,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,arranged his buttons and his drapery generally.
6937,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6938,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Now, if you could only be as good as you're purty,"" exclaimed"
6939,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Kathleen, wheeling Will suddenly round before his tongue was quite in"
6940,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"place again, ""you'd do well enough."""
6941,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6942,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"With a few finishing touches to Emily's sash ribbon, Kathleen went off"
6943,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,to make her own gorgeous toilet for her afternoon out.
6944,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6945,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,The dinner was next to be gotten through with. But that was not an
6946,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,unpleasant hour to Will. After dinner the children were permitted by
6947,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,their mother to amuse themselves under the shadow of the great elm
6948,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,behind the house. She knew that with Emily this permission simply
6949,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"meant liberty to sit quietly beneath the overhanging branches, gazing"
6950,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"dreamily over the soft summer landscape, or listening to the sweet"
6951,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,sounds that stirred the air around and above her. But with Will it
6952,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,might be more broadly interpreted into leave for frequent raids over
6953,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"fences and through bars for butterflies and beetles, or any luckless"
6954,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,rover that strayed along. So she explained to her son in this wise:--
6955,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6956,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Will, dear, remember that your grandmamma is coming for you, and you"
6957,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,must not soil or tear your clothes by running about. Play quietly in
6958,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"the shade. The time will not be long now."""
6959,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6960,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Yes, mum."""
6961,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6962,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Such implicit obedience as this ""Yes, mum"" implied! In fact, there was"
6963,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,the promise in it of every one of the cardinal virtues.
6964,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6965,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"The two children then went away through the long hall, whose doors"
6966,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"stood wide open in the warm summer afternoon, and Will, dragging along"
6967,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"the slower-footed Emily, hurried on to the elm tree."
6968,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6969,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Don't pull so, Will; I shall drop my basket, and my spool and"
6970,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"thimble will roll away."""
6971,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6972,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""What do you want to bother with work for this beautiful afternoon?"""
6973,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"inquired Will, slackening his pace."
6974,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6975,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""I promised mamma I would try and finish it this week,"" said Emily,"
6976,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""and I like to keep my word."""
6977,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6978,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""I thought the machine sewed."""
6979,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6980,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""So it does; but mamma says I must learn just the same as if there"
6981,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"were no machines."""
6982,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6983,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Well, I'm glad I'm not a girl, to sit pricking my fingers, and"
6984,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"jabbing needles in and out all day."""
6985,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6986,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Patience was not one of Will's virtues.
6987,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6988,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,How lovely it was out under the elm! The sweet-scented grass was warm
6989,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"with the afternoon sun, and musical with the chirp and hum of its"
6990,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"insect homes. The bees fluttered in and out over mamma's rose garden,"
6991,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and all the air was filled with the delicate fragrance of the roses.
6992,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
6993,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Emily, seated on the great gnarled elm roots, drank in all the sweet"
6994,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"scents and sounds, her forgotten work-basket lying overturned in the"
6995,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,grass before her. Will spread himself out at full length on the
6996,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"ground, and kept his eyes open for chippers and spiders, and all the"
6997,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"busy little things that crept, or leaped, or flitted around him. Now"
6998,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and then the afternoon hush was broken by the faintly tinkling bells
6999,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"of a horse-car turning some distant corner, the rumbling of a heavy"
7000,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"team going over the dusty turnpike, or the voices of the belfry clocks"
7001,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,calling the hour to each other from the steeples of the neighboring
7002,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,city.
7003,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7004,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Master Will, however, soon became tired of this quiet. He scrambled"
7005,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"up, and wandering away into the rose garden, lifted caressingly to his"
7006,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,cheek the beautiful pink blossoms which leaned towards him from amid
7007,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,the green leaves. He was looking for a choice little bud to fasten in
7008,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Emily's hair; and when he found it, he came whistling out into the"
7009,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"clear grassy spaces again, a little bird in a bough overhead tilting,"
7010,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"and twittering, and eying him askance."
7011,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7012,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will rushed up to Emily, and hung the bud in her ear; he rearranged it"
7013,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"in the blue ribbon of her hair, so that it nodded sleepily over her"
7014,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"nose; he dropped it, as if it were a tiny pink egg, in the soft golden"
7015,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,moss of curls which he upturned on his sister's head. Then he threw it
7016,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"away, and stamped on it; for Emily had drawn a book from her pocket,"
7017,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"and deep in some fairy under-world story, was unmindful of his roses"
7018,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and his pains.
7019,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7020,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,He ran recklessly away into the rose garden; he caught a bumblebee; he
7021,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"pursued a daddy long-leg with the watering-pot, going deeper and"
7022,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,deeper all the time among the briery branches. The crashing of the
7023,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,stems caused Emily to come up from fairy-land a moment.
7024,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7025,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Have a care, Will, dear. The roses have thorns. You may tear your"
7026,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"nice jacket."""
7027,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7028,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Crash, crash! rip, rip! The rose trees are dragging at Will with their"
7029,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"prickly fingers. With great effort he burst away from them, and rushed"
7030,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"out, with no worse mischance than a rent in his trousers."
7031,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7032,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Aw! aw! aw!"""
7033,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7034,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"All the little knolls seemed to take up Will's sorrowful cry, and"
7035,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,repeat it.
7036,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7037,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""You must not tear or soil your clothes."""
7038,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7039,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Every cricket in the grass seemed to be screaming these words of his
7040,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"mother, and here was her luckless son with two green spots on his"
7041,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"stockings, and a grievous rent in his new pantaloons."
7042,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7043,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"It was Kathleen's afternoon out; she had warned him, and there was no"
7044,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,help in that direction. He looked mournfully over his shoulder at the
7045,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,damages with a vague idea that he had perhaps some undeveloped
7046,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,capacity for mending.
7047,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7048,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"[Illustration: ""YOU'LL SEE HOW NICELY I'LL SEW IT.""]"
7049,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7050,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Couldn't you pin it up nicely?"" he inquired, in most insinuating"
7051,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"tones, of Emily, whose eye just then met his."
7052,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7053,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Emily burst into a merry laugh.
7054,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7055,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will was mute with indignation, and tingling to his finger's ends,"
7056,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,with this untimely mirth. His flashing eyes asked if this were a time
7057,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,for jesting.
7058,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7059,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Come here, Willy, boy, and you'll see how nicely I'll sew it, not pin"
7060,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"it. Never fret about it, dear; I will explain to mamma that you were"
7061,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,really not so much in fault. It was only rather a mistake to get in so
7062,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"far among the bushes. If you had been chasing the cat, or turning"
7063,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"somersets, she might, perhaps, be vexed; but poh! she will excuse"
7064,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"this."""
7065,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7066,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will, unseen by Emily, wiped away with his thumb one big tear after"
7067,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,another out of the corner of his eye.
7068,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7069,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""She is a good sister, anyhow, and I am a mean fellow ever to get mad"
7070,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"with her, and say rude things to her,"" he said to himself, as Emily"
7071,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"darned, and chatted, and bade him be of good cheer."
7072,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7073,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""My stockings, too, sister. There's a great green grass stain on both"
7074,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"of them, and grandmamma expects us to be _so_ nice."""
7075,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7076,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,Will coughed to choke down a sob.
7077,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7078,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""Perhaps you may have time to change them, Will. I will help you. But"
7079,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"we must get the pantaloons all nicely done first."""
7080,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7081,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"So this kind sister stitched, and taught unconsciously as she"
7082,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"stitched, lessons of love and patience, lessons of cheerful"
7083,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"helpfulness and sweet unselfishness, which Will never forgot."
7084,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7085,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"More than once, in after life, when, in heedless pursuit of life's"
7086,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"roses, he had been wounded by its thorns, he remembered that sweet"
7087,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"face of consolation, those dear hands held out to aid him, and all the"
7088,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"sunshine and the song of that sweet summer afternoon, and fresh peace"
7089,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,and hope came to him with the remembrance.
7090,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7091,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"""It's all finished now, the very last stitch; and now for the"
7092,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"stockings. Let me see the spots."""
7093,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7094,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"Will put his two heels firmly together, turned out his toes, pulled up"
7095,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"his puffy pantaloons, and stooped his head and strained his eyes to"
7096,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,look for them.
7097,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,
7098,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"They were but little ones, after all, and a brisk rubbing with the"
7099,STITCHING AND TEACHING.,"handkerchief, and a judicious pulling down of the trouser bindings,"

7164,SQUIRRELS.,How pretty little squirrels look perched in the branches of a tree! I
7165,SQUIRRELS.,like to watch them as they nimbly run up the trunk or spring from
7166,SQUIRRELS.,bough to bough. One or two are generally to be seen in a clump of
7167,SQUIRRELS.,great old beeches near a house in the country where I usually spend
7168,SQUIRRELS.,some happy weeks in summer; and I will tell you a story of a little
7169,SQUIRRELS.,squirrel whose acquaintance I made there last summer.
7170,SQUIRRELS.,
7171,SQUIRRELS.,"I happened to be up very early one morning, long before breakfast was"
7172,SQUIRRELS.,"ready or any of the family were down, and I went out into the garden"
7173,SQUIRRELS.,"to enjoy the fresh, sweet smell of the early day. The cows were"
7174,SQUIRRELS.,"grazing in the field beyond, and now and then lowing a friendly"
7175,SQUIRRELS.,"""good-morning"" to each other. Some ducks were waddling in procession"
7176,SQUIRRELS.,"down to the pond, quacking out their wise remarks as they went. The"
7177,SQUIRRELS.,little birds were singing lustily their welcome to the new-born day.
7178,SQUIRRELS.,"Even the old watch-dog came yawning, stretching, blinking and wagging"
7179,SQUIRRELS.,"his tail in kindly dog-fashion to bid me ""good-day"" in the summer"
7180,SQUIRRELS.,sunshine.
7181,SQUIRRELS.,
7182,SQUIRRELS.,"As I stood under the great beech trees, taking in with greedy eye and"
7183,SQUIRRELS.,"ear the sights and sounds of country-life so refreshing to a Londoner,"
7184,SQUIRRELS.,"I heard something fall from one of the trees, then a scuffle, and"
7185,SQUIRRELS.,immediately afterward a white Persian cat belonging to the house
7186,SQUIRRELS.,bounded toward me in hot pursuit of a dear little squirrel. I was just
7187,SQUIRRELS.,in time to save the poor little animal by stepping between it and the
7188,SQUIRRELS.,cat. The squirrel passed under the edge of my dress and made off again
7189,SQUIRRELS.,up another tree; so pussy lost her prey.
7190,SQUIRRELS.,
7191,SQUIRRELS.,"Soon afterward, when we were at breakfast, the butler told us that one"
7192,SQUIRRELS.,"of the little boys of the village, who had lost a pet squirrel, had"
7193,SQUIRRELS.,asked if he might look for it in the garden of the house. It had first
7194,SQUIRRELS.,"escaped into some trees in the park, and he had traced it from them"
7195,SQUIRRELS.,into the garden. It at once occurred to me that this must be the
7196,SQUIRRELS.,little creature I had saved from the cat. I remembered how it made
7197,SQUIRRELS.,"straight toward me, as if asking me for protection from its enemy,"
7198,SQUIRRELS.,"which only a tame squirrel would do; and I proposed, when breakfast"
7199,SQUIRRELS.,"was over, that we should go out and help in the search."
7200,SQUIRRELS.,
7201,SQUIRRELS.,"Little Jack Tompkins stood under the beech trees, looking with"
7202,SQUIRRELS.,tear-stained face up into the branches. Suddenly I saw his face
7203,SQUIRRELS.,"brighten, and he called out, ""I see un, ma'am; I see un! If so be no"
7204,SQUIRRELS.,"one warn't by, I be sure he'd come to I."""
7205,SQUIRRELS.,
7206,SQUIRRELS.,I need not say we retreated to a distance; then Jack called up the
7207,SQUIRRELS.,"tree in a loud whisper, ""Billee, Billee!"" and in a minute down came"
7208,SQUIRRELS.,the little creature on to his shoulder. I can tell you Jack was a
7209,SQUIRRELS.,happier child than he had been when he came into the garden. And when
7210,SQUIRRELS.,"I told him what a narrow escape ""Billee"" had had from the cat, he"
7211,SQUIRRELS.,"said, ""It would be hard if a cat eat he, for our old puss brought he"
7212,SQUIRRELS.,"up with her own kits."" Then he told us how the squirrel, when a tiny"
7213,SQUIRRELS.,"thing, had dropped out of its nest and been found by him lying almost"
7214,SQUIRRELS.,"dead at the foot of a tree, and how he had carried it home and tried"
7215,SQUIRRELS.,whether pussy would adopt it as one of her own kittens. The cat was
7216,SQUIRRELS.,"kind; the squirrel throve under her motherly care, and became Jack's"
7217,SQUIRRELS.,pet and companion.
7218,SQUIRRELS.,
7219,SQUIRRELS.,"Now, children, in this instance it was all very well to keep a tame"
7220,SQUIRRELS.,"squirrel. ""Billee"" seemed happy leading the life he was accustomed to;"
7221,SQUIRRELS.,"he had been fed and cared for by human beings from his infancy, and"
7222,SQUIRRELS.,might be as incapable of finding food and managing for himself in a
7223,SQUIRRELS.,wild state as a poor canary would be if let loose from its cage. But
7224,SQUIRRELS.,generally it is cruel to imprison little wild birds and animals who
7225,SQUIRRELS.,have known the enjoyment of liberty.

7233,PUPPET.,
7234,PUPPET.,
7235,PUPPET.,Puppet had two occupations. She had also a guitar and a half-bushel
7236,PUPPET.,basket. These things were her capital--her stock in trade.
7237,PUPPET.,
7238,PUPPET.,"The guitar belonged to one of her occupations, the half-bushel basket"
7239,PUPPET.,to the other.
7240,PUPPET.,
7241,PUPPET.,"In consideration of her first employment, she might have been called a"
7242,PUPPET.,"street guitarist. In consideration of her second, she might have been"
7243,PUPPET.,called a beggar--a broken-bits beggar.
7244,PUPPET.,
7245,PUPPET.,"Puppet would have been considered, among lawyers, ""shrewd;"" or, at a"
7246,PUPPET.,"mothers' meeting, ""cunning;"" or, among business men, ""sharp."" That is"
7247,PUPPET.,"to say, she knew a thing or two. She knew that being able to sing no"
7248,PUPPET.,"songs was a disadvantage to her first occupation, as a large hole,"
7249,PUPPET.,"half way up her basket, was an advantage to her second."
7250,PUPPET.,
7251,PUPPET.,It seems odd that a hole in one's begging basket should be an
7252,PUPPET.,advantage.
7253,PUPPET.,
7254,PUPPET.,"But because of the hole, she had always behind her a crowd of dogs,"
7255,PUPPET.,"that seemed to have been just dropped from the basket, the last one"
7256,PUPPET.,never having fairly got his nose out; and because of the dogs she was
7257,PUPPET.,"known as ""Puppet"" all over the city."
7258,PUPPET.,
7259,PUPPET.,To be known by a characteristic name is of great advantage to a
7260,PUPPET.,beggar.
7261,PUPPET.,
7262,PUPPET.,"If Biddy, looking from the basement door, says to cook, ""Och, an'"
7263,PUPPET.,"there comes up the street our little Puppet, with her dogs all behind"
7264,PUPPET.,"her, carrying her basket,"" cook is much more likely to see the broken"
7265,PUPPET.,"bits ""botherin' roun' on the schalves o' the cubbid,"" than she would"
7266,PUPPET.,"be if Biddy should say, ""Shure, an' thir cams to us a dirty beggar, it"
7267,PUPPET.,"is."""
7268,PUPPET.,
7269,PUPPET.,"But it is with Puppet's first occupation, and not her second, that we"
7270,PUPPET.,have to do. If you had not read more descriptions of faces within the
7271,PUPPET.,last year than you can possibly remember in all the years of your life
7272,PUPPET.,"put together, I would tell you what sort of face Puppet's was; that it"
7273,PUPPET.,"was a bright face, with blue eyes, just the color of the blue ribbon"
7274,PUPPET.,"that went first round the guitar's neck, and then round Puppet's; that"
7275,PUPPET.,Puppet's teeth were as white as the mother-of-pearl pegs that held her
7276,PUPPET.,guitar strings at the bottom; that her cheeks were as white as the
7277,PUPPET.,"ivory keys; that her hair was long, and yellow--just the shade of the"
7278,PUPPET.,guitar's yellow face.
7279,PUPPET.,
7280,PUPPET.,But that would be very much like a dozen other faces that you have
7281,PUPPET.,seen; so I will only say that it was a smiling little face.
7282,PUPPET.,
7283,PUPPET.,"It smiled as it bent over the guitar, while the little fingers picked"
7284,PUPPET.,their ways in and out among the strings; and it smiled yet more
7285,PUPPET.,sweetly as she looked up to catch the coppers thrown from the fourth
7286,PUPPET.,"and fifth story, and sky-parlor windows."
7287,PUPPET.,
7288,PUPPET.,Puppet once lived with a man who said that he was her uncle; and she
7289,PUPPET.,"believed him so thoroughly, that she let him box her ears whenever he"
7290,PUPPET.,"felt like it, till he died. Since then Puppet had lived almost"
7291,PUPPET.,friendless and alone.
7292,PUPPET.,
7293,PUPPET.,One hot July day Puppet was wandering through the streets of the great
7294,PUPPET.,"city, with her little guitar under her little arm. The city did not"
7295,PUPPET.,"seem so great to Puppet as it does to some of the rest of us, because"
7296,PUPPET.,she was born and brought up there.
7297,PUPPET.,
7298,PUPPET.,"""O, dear,"" sighed Puppet, ""_what_ a mean place you are!"""
7299,PUPPET.,
7300,PUPPET.,No one had given her a copper since the cool of the morning. People
7301,PUPPET.,seemed to have a fancy for spending their coppers on soda-water and
7302,PUPPET.,ice-cream.
7303,PUPPET.,
7304,PUPPET.,"""What shall I do?"" moaned Puppet. Whatever should she do? Puppet must"
7305,PUPPET.,"have coppers, or she could not live."
7306,PUPPET.,
7307,PUPPET.,"She sat in a cool, shaded court, close to the busy street; but she"
7308,PUPPET.,"couldn't get away from the heat, and the noise, and the people"
7309,PUPPET.,"sighing, like herself, ""O dear, O dear!"""
7310,PUPPET.,
7311,PUPPET.,"""I'll try once more,"" said Puppet, tuning her guitar."
7312,PUPPET.,
7313,PUPPET.,"She played ""Home, Sweet Home,"" with variations. But all the people who"
7314,PUPPET.,"heard her were suffering, because their homes in the city were rather"
7315,PUPPET.,"hot than sweet. ""Home, Sweet Home"" could win no pennies from ""city"
7316,PUPPET.,"folks"" in July."
7317,PUPPET.,
7318,PUPPET.,"Then Puppet whistled to her guitar accompaniment a little ""Bird"
7319,PUPPET.,"Waltz,"" and whirled on the pavement in time, till I doubt if she"
7320,PUPPET.,"herself knew whether the guitar had gone mad, and were waltzing about"
7321,PUPPET.,"her, or she were waltzing about the guitar."
7322,PUPPET.,
7323,PUPPET.,"A boy came dancing into the court, singing,--"
7324,PUPPET.,
7325,PUPPET.,"""O, whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad!"
7326,PUPPET.,"O, whistle, and I'll come to you, my lad!"""
7327,PUPPET.,
7328,PUPPET.,"But he danced out again, without leaving a penny behind him; so it"
7329,PUPPET.,"would have been just as well if he had never come in. Still, he amused"
7330,PUPPET.,"himself for a few minutes, which not many people were able to do in"
7331,PUPPET.,that hot July midday.
7332,PUPPET.,
7333,PUPPET.,"Puppet went from the little court, and wandered on and on. At last she"
7334,PUPPET.,left the city far away behind her.
7335,PUPPET.,
7336,PUPPET.,And out and away from the city there were green fields.
7337,PUPPET.,
7338,PUPPET.,"Puppet had heard of green fields, but she had never seen any face to"
7339,PUPPET.,"face before. As she looked at them, she had a dim remembrance that she"
7340,PUPPET.,"had heard that they were covered with long, waving grass. But all"
7341,PUPPET.,"these fields were close shaven, like the beautiful mouse-colored"
7342,PUPPET.,horses in the city.
7343,PUPPET.,
7344,PUPPET.,"It was pleasant, but not very exciting to a city girl. The city girl"
7345,PUPPET.,presently grew tired of it.
7346,PUPPET.,
7347,PUPPET.,"""There seem to be houses farther along,"" she said; ""I'll go and play"
7348,PUPPET.,"there."""
7349,PUPPET.,
7350,PUPPET.,"Puppet slung the little guitar about her little neck, and started off"
7351,PUPPET.,again.
7352,PUPPET.,
7353,PUPPET.,Presently she came to a cottage with a little green yard in front of
7354,PUPPET.,"it, and in the middle of the little green yard was a great green tree."
7355,PUPPET.,
7356,PUPPET.,"Puppet sat down on the grass, leaned against the tree, and felt very"
7357,PUPPET.,hungry.
7358,PUPPET.,
7359,PUPPET.,"A lady was sitting by an open window, sewing. She was sitting so that"
7360,PUPPET.,"Puppet could see only a bit of her left cheek, and her dark hair, just"
7361,PUPPET.,"beginning to turn gray, and her right hand as she brought the needle"
7362,PUPPET.,"up from her work. From what she did see, Puppet thought that she would"
7363,PUPPET.,"give her something to eat, if she could but get her attention. Surely,"
7364,PUPPET.,"she must be often hungry herself, or why should she have so many gray"
7365,PUPPET.,hairs?
7366,PUPPET.,
7367,PUPPET.,"Puppet, leaning against the tree, ran her fingers over the guitar"
7368,PUPPET.,frets in light harmonies; but the lady did not look.
7369,PUPPET.,
7370,PUPPET.,"Her thoughts must be far away, in a quiet and happy place, that"
7371,PUPPET.,Puppet's harmonies should seem a part of that place.
7372,PUPPET.,
7373,PUPPET.,"The guitar broke into a low, mournful minor. Still the lady gave no"
7374,PUPPET.,heed to Puppet.
7375,PUPPET.,
7376,PUPPET.,Puppet was feeling very hungry. She would play the Fandango. That
7377,PUPPET.,_must_ rouse any one. She began at the most rattling part.
7378,PUPPET.,
7379,PUPPET.,"The gray-haired lady looked round quickly. ""Bless me, bless me! what's"
7380,PUPPET.,"this?"" Seeing a little girl out by the tree, she put her sewing on the"
7381,PUPPET.,"table, and came to the door and into the yard."
7382,PUPPET.,
7383,PUPPET.,"""Dear me! a little girl with yellow hair, and I just to have been"
7384,PUPPET.,"dreaming of a little girl with yellow hair!"""
7385,PUPPET.,
7386,PUPPET.,"""Is anything the matter with my hair, mum?"" Puppet stopped playing,"
7387,PUPPET.,and ran her hands through the yellow mass of uncombed locks.
7388,PUPPET.,
7389,PUPPET.,"""Ah, no, little girl! there is nothing the matter with your hair."
7390,PUPPET.,"Only--"" The lady was thinking how soft, and fine, and curly was the"
7391,PUPPET.,yellow hair of which she had been dreaming.
7392,PUPPET.,
7393,PUPPET.,"""What do you want?"" asked the lady."
7394,PUPPET.,
7395,PUPPET.,"""I'm very hungry,"" said Puppet, ""because of the walk, and--and--and"
7396,PUPPET.,"all,"" concluded Puppet, remembering that the lady could not"
7397,PUPPET.,understand.
7398,PUPPET.,
7399,PUPPET.,"""Come in, then."""
7400,PUPPET.,
7401,PUPPET.,Puppet went in. Up in one corner of the sitting-room were a little
7402,PUPPET.,"tip-cart and a doll. Puppet ate her bread and meat, looking hard at"
7403,PUPPET.,the tip-cart.
7404,PUPPET.,
7405,PUPPET.,"""Where is it, mum?"""
7406,PUPPET.,
7407,PUPPET.,"""Where is what, child?"""
7408,PUPPET.,
7409,PUPPET.,"""The child, mum."" Puppet pointed to the tip-cart."
7410,PUPPET.,
7411,PUPPET.,"""Gone, my dear,"" said the lady, softly."
7412,PUPPET.,
7413,PUPPET.,"""Dead?"" Puppet remembered that that was what they said about her uncle"
7414,PUPPET.,when he went away. It was the only going away that she had ever known.
7415,PUPPET.,
7416,PUPPET.,"""Yes, I suppose so,"" said the lady, with a little shiver."
7417,PUPPET.,
7418,PUPPET.,"""That's bad, mum."""
7419,PUPPET.,
7420,PUPPET.,"""No, not bad,"" said the lady, sorrowfully. ""It is just right that it"
7421,PUPPET.,"should be so."""
7422,PUPPET.,
7423,PUPPET.,"""But it must be lonesome like, unless there were kicks and things."""
7424,PUPPET.,Puppet was still thinking of her uncle.
7425,PUPPET.,
7426,PUPPET.,"The lady wondered what the child could mean, and not knowing, said,--"
7427,PUPPET.,
7428,PUPPET.,"""What's your name? How could I have forgotten to ask your name?"""
7429,PUPPET.,
7430,PUPPET.,"""Puppet."""
7431,PUPPET.,
7432,PUPPET.,"""That's a funny name. And where do you live?"""
7433,PUPPET.,
7434,PUPPET.,"""Two or three miles away from here."""
7435,PUPPET.,
7436,PUPPET.,"""Have you walked here to-day?"""
7437,PUPPET.,
7438,PUPPET.,"""Yes, mum."""
7439,PUPPET.,
7440,PUPPET.,"""What should make the child walk so far, I wonder?"""
7441,PUPPET.,
7442,PUPPET.,"""Money, mum, and things to eat."""
7443,PUPPET.,
7444,PUPPET.,"""Have you eaten enough?"""
7445,PUPPET.,
7446,PUPPET.,"""Yes. I must go home now, or I shall be late."""
7447,PUPPET.,
7448,PUPPET.,"""Are you sure you know the way?"" asked the lady, a little anxiously."
7449,PUPPET.,"""You're such a little thing!"""
7450,PUPPET.,
7451,PUPPET.,"""O, yes, mum! Go as I came."""
7452,PUPPET.,
7453,PUPPET.,"""Well, good by."""
7454,PUPPET.,
7455,PUPPET.,"""Good by, mum."""
7456,PUPPET.,
7457,PUPPET.,But was Puppet _sure_ that she knew the way?

7459,PUPPET.,*       *       *       *       *
7460,PUPPET.,
7461,PUPPET.,"The next morning, a man walking on a road that ran by the edge of a"
7462,PUPPET.,"meadow, was going to his work."
7463,PUPPET.,
7464,PUPPET.,Hark! What did he hear? Was it a cry! was it a child's cry? And what
7465,PUPPET.,was that? It sounded like a fiddle. He stopped to look around.
7466,PUPPET.,
7467,PUPPET.,"""I declare, we've had a high tide in the night!"" said he, and trudged"
7468,PUPPET.,on.
7469,PUPPET.,
7470,PUPPET.,But what was that? _That_ was certainly a child's cry.
7471,PUPPET.,
7472,PUPPET.,The man looked sharply about.
7473,PUPPET.,
7474,PUPPET.,"""It can't be she,"" he said. ""Folks from heaven wouldn't cry, even if"
7475,PUPPET.,"they were let to come--at least, if they were little children."""
7476,PUPPET.,
7477,PUPPET.,"And so he still looked sharply about. And looking, what did he see?"

7479,PUPPET.,"He saw great haystacks of meadow hay out in the meadow, with the"

7481,PUPPET.,"haystack. On its top, with her yellow hair and smiling face in sight,"
7482,PUPPET.,"was--it could not be, though--but it was--a little girl, and dangling"
7483,PUPPET.,by the side of the stack was a guitar with a yellow face. The man
7484,PUPPET.,waded through the water that lay between the dry land and the stack.
7485,PUPPET.,
7486,PUPPET.,"""Crawl down to my shoulders;"" and he stood by the side of the stack"

7492,PUPPET.,
7493,PUPPET.,"""I went everywhere to try to get home, and it was dark, all but the"

7496,PUPPET.,
7497,PUPPET.,"""Sure enough, the prop."""
7498,PUPPET.,

7500,PUPPET.,
7501,PUPPET.,"""Poor child!"""
7502,PUPPET.,
7503,PUPPET.,"""And I never saw the water come before, and it was only wet enough to"

7505,PUPPET.,
7506,PUPPET.,"""Well, well! We'll go home and get something to eat."""
7507,PUPPET.,
7508,PUPPET.,The man walked into his kitchen with the little girl and the guitar on
7509,PUPPET.,his shoulders.
7510,PUPPET.,
7511,PUPPET.,"""Why, John, are you back? Dear me, if there isn't that same"
7512,PUPPET.,"child--Puppet!"""
7513,PUPPET.,
7514,PUPPET.,"John went off to his work again. Puppet ate her breakfast, and told"
7515,PUPPET.,"her story, and then said,--"
7516,PUPPET.,
7517,PUPPET.,"""Please, mum, may I play with the cart?"""
7518,PUPPET.,
7519,PUPPET.,"And because of her yellow hair, she might play with the cart."
7520,PUPPET.,
7521,PUPPET.,"""But aren't you sick, and oughtn't you to take some medicine, and go"
7522,PUPPET.,"to bed?"" asked the lady, whose hair had grown gray over sickness and"
7523,PUPPET.,medicine.
7524,PUPPET.,
7525,PUPPET.,Puppet meditated. She felt very well. She thought that she had rather
7526,PUPPET.,"play with the tip-cart than to take medicine. So she played all day,"
7527,PUPPET.,and went to bed at night.
7528,PUPPET.,
7529,PUPPET.,"At night John come home from his work, and, as usual, heard of all"
7530,PUPPET.,that had happened through the day.
7531,PUPPET.,
7532,PUPPET.,"""I wish we could keep the little thing, John, dear. She has yellow"

7534,PUPPET.,
7535,PUPPET.,"""Yes,"" said John, ""I saw."""
7536,PUPPET.,
7537,PUPPET.,"""And she'd be _such_ a comfort!"""
7538,PUPPET.,
7539,PUPPET.,"""If she didn't die by and by,"" said John."
7540,PUPPET.,
7541,PUPPET.,"""But, John, dear, just think of a little thing like her spending the"
7542,PUPPET.,"night in the middle of a meadow, with the water all about her."""
7543,PUPPET.,
7544,PUPPET.,John thought. And he thought that if she could stand that without
7545,PUPPET.,"being sick, she could stand their love without dying."
7546,PUPPET.,
7547,PUPPET.,So Puppet and the guitar live with John and the gray-haired lady.

7558,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7559,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7560,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"All the hill-side was green with maples, and birches, and pines. The"
7561,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"meadows at its foot were green, too, with the tufted salt grass, and"
7562,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,glittering with the silver threads of tide braided among its winding
7563,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"creeks. Beyond was the city, misty and gray, stretching its wan arms"
7564,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,to the phantom ships flitting along the horizon.
7565,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7566,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,From the green hill-side you could hear the city's muffled hum and
7567,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"roar, and sometimes the far-off clanging of the bells from its hundred"
7568,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,belfries. But the maples and birches seemed to hear and see nothing
7569,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,beyond the sunshine over their heads and the winds which went
7570,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"frolicking by. Life was one long dance with them, through the budding"
7571,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"spring and the leafy summer, and on through the grand gala days of"
7572,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"autumn, till the frost came down on the hills, and whispered,--"
7573,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7574,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Your dancing days are all over."""
7575,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7576,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"But the pines were quite different. They, the stately ones, stood"
7577,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"quite aloof, the older and taller ones looking stiffly over the heads"
7578,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"of the rollicking maples, and making solemn reverences to the great"
7579,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,gray clouds that swept inland from the ocean. The straight little
7580,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"saplings at their feet copied the manners of their elders, and folding"
7581,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"their fingers primly, and rustling their stiff little green petticoats"
7582,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"decorously, sat up so silent and proper."
7583,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7584,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"So unlike the small birches and maples that chattered incessantly,"
7585,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"wagging their giddy heads, and playing tag with the butterflies in the"
7586,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,sunshine all the day long!
7587,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7588,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""How tiresome those stupid old pines are! No expression, no animation."
7589,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"So lofty and so exclusive, and forever grumbling to each other in"
7590,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"their hoarse old Scandinavian, which it gives one the croup even to"
7591,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"listen to! Of what possible use _can_ they be?"""
7592,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7593,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,This was what the maple said to the birch one day when the Summer and
7594,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,her patience with her sombre neighbor were on the wane--one day when
7595,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,there was a gleam of golden pumpkins in the tawny corn stubble beyond
7596,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"the wood, and the purpling grapes hung ripening over the old stone"
7597,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"wall that lay between, and the maple had brightened its summer dress"
7598,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,with a gay little leaf set here and there in its shining folds.
7599,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7600,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The birch agreed with the maple about the pines, and the maple went"
7601,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,glibly on.
7602,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7603,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""I've ordered my autumn dresses--a different one for each day in the"
7604,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,week. Just think of those horrid pines never altering the fashion of
7605,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"their stiff old plaiting."""
7606,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7607,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""We shall not be obliged to remain in this dull place much longer,"""
7608,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"said the tall pines loftily to each other, looking quite over the"
7609,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"heads of the maple and the birch. ""We shall soon be crossing the"
7610,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"ocean, and then our lives will have just begun. We simply vegetate"
7611,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"here."""
7612,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7613,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Ho, ho!"" laughed the maple and the birch behind their fluttering"
7614,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"green fans, pretending to be greatly amused at what the west wind was"
7615,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,saying to them.
7616,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7617,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Now, though the trees spoke a different language, yet each understood"
7618,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,perfectly well what the other said; so their rudeness was quite
7619,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,inexcusable.
7620,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7621,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"When the summer was ended, the maple began to put on her gorgeous"
7622,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"autumn dresses; but the pines looked much at the sky, and paid little"
7623,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"heed to the maple. The other trees on the hill-side, quite faded with"
7624,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"their summer gayeties, looked on languidly in the still autumn days at"
7625,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,the maple's brilliant toilets.
7626,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7627,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Soon the cold rains swept in from the sea, blurring the wood vistas;"
7628,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"and when they were gone, the frost came in the midnight, with its"
7629,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"unwelcome message, and later the snow lay white above all the faded"
7630,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,and fallen crimson and gold of the maple and the tarnished silver of
7631,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,the birch.
7632,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7633,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"All the trees, brown and bare now, moaned in the wintry wind--all but"
7634,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"the tall pines, and they were crossing the ocean; their lives had"
7635,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"begun. The little saplings remained behind, but with their heads"
7636,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,perked stiffly up above the snow; they had the air of expecting
7637,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,somebody.
7638,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7639,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"They were not disappointed. One sunny morning, a boy and a girl came"
7640,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"singing through the wood paths, each in a pair of high-topped boots,"
7641,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"and each in a faded and closely-buttoned coat, the girl with a blue"
7642,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"hood pulled over her rosy face, and the boy with a fur cap closely"
7643,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"tied about his ears by a red comforter. The two drew a hand-sled, and"
7644,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,peered about under the tall trunks as they went stamping through the
7645,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,deep snow. How they shouted as they spied the little pine trees
7646,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"perking up their heads! How they tossed aside the snow, and worked"
7647,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"away with their jackknives, hacking at the little pine trees till they"
7648,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"had cut them all down, all ready to be piled up on their hand-sled."
7649,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7650,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Where are you going?"" asked the giddy little birch of the pines,"
7651,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,peeping out from a small window in her snow-house. Her nose was
7652,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"purple, and her fingers stiff with cold; but down under the earth her"
7653,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"feet were warm, and that was pleasant, at any rate."
7654,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7655,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""It is of no consequence where,"" said the pines, in their grimmest"
7656,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Scandinavian.
7657,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7658,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The birch simply said, ""O!"" and drew in her little purple nose, hoping"
7659,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"heartily they were all going to be burned, as that would be a good end"
7660,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,and riddance of them.
7661,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7662,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,But the little pines were not going to be burned; they were going away
7663,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,to the city that lay misty and still beyond the frozen meadows.
7664,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Stretched out stiffly on the hand-sled, they were jostled along out"
7665,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"through the wood, over the frozen turnpike, and across the mill-dam to"
7666,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Boston.
7667,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7668,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"They alighted at the Boylston Market, and were ranged in a row against"
7669,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,the dark brick wall.
7670,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7671,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""How much happens in a very short time!"" they said to each other; ""all"
7672,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"those gaudy, chattering trees left without a leaf to cover them, our"
7673,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"own friends all gone on their travels, and we here in the city,"
7674,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"wrapped in our warm winter furs."""
7675,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7676,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,It was the Christmas week. The shop windows were gay with toys and
7677,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,gorgeous Christmas offerings; the shop doors were opening and shutting
7678,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,on the crowd that came and went through them. A bustling throng of
7679,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"people passed incessantly up and down the narrow sidewalks, and"
7680,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"carriages of all descriptions blocked the crossings, or drove"
7681,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,recklessly over the frozen pavement.
7682,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7683,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The old woman in the quilted black hood and shaggy cape, who had"
7684,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"charge of the little pine trees, drove a brisk trade that day in her"
7685,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,wreaths and holly; but though many people stopped to admire the little
7686,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"pines, and even to ask their price, no purchaser had yet appeared for"
7687,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,them.
7688,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7689,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The old dame was rubbing her mittened hands briskly together, and"
7690,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"mumbling in a displeased way at the pine trees, when a carriage drew"
7691,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"suddenly up at the curbstone, and out sprang a little girl."
7692,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7693,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""See, papa, how lovely! So green, and fresh, and thick!"" she said,"
7694,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,pointing to the row of pines.
7695,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7696,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,A bargain was concluded in a trice. The money was dropped into the
7697,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"eager, outstretched mitten of the old woman, and a little Christmas"
7698,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"tree dragged over the sidewalk, and set up in the buggy."
7699,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7700,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""We must have some of these lower branches cut off; they are in the"
7701,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"way,"" said papa."
7702,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7703,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Hev a knife, sir?"" shouted a ragged little fellow, whipping a rusty"
7704,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,old knife out of his pocket.
7705,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7706,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Please, sir, lemme cut it for you. Say, where?"" he cried, laying hold"
7707,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"of the pine, as the gentleman in the buggy pointed to him where to"
7708,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,cut.
7709,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7710,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The lower branches being trimmed to the gentleman's satisfaction, the"
7711,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas tree, leaning comfortably against the crimson afghan, was"
7712,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"soon on its way to Meadow Home, while its lower branches and some"
7713,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,jingling small coin remained in the hands of the gaping urchin on the
7714,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,curbstone.
7715,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7716,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""This here's luck--fust-rate luck,"" remarked the small boy, stamping"
7717,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"his feet, and staring stupidly after the retreating buggy wheels."
7718,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7719,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Out of the way there!"" growled a man in a farmer's frock, lifting a"
7720,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,pile of frozen turkeys from a wagon.
7721,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7722,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The boy ducked aside, his ragged little trousers fluttering in the"
7723,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,wind. Then he sat down on the market steps to count his coin.
7724,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7725,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Hi! twenty-five cents. There's a mutton stew and onions for you and"
7726,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"your folks a Christmas, Mike Slattery, and all this jolly green stuff"
7727,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"thrown in free gratis. That chap was a gen'leman, and no mistake."
7728,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Won't Winnie hop when she sees me a-h'isting of these here over our

7732,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7733,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Mike waved his Christmas boughs aloft in great glee.
7734,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7735,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,An old gentleman with gold-headed cane and spectacles was going up the
7736,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"steps of the market, followed by a beautiful black-and-white setter."
7737,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,The playful dog sprang at the green branches. Mike held on to them
7738,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"stoutly. The dog suddenly let go of them, and bounded away, while Mike"
7739,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"rolled over and over to the foot of the steps, clutching tightly the"
7740,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,pine boughs.
7741,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7742,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""You'll ketch it,"" he muttered, setting his teeth hard together behind"
7743,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"his white lips, and trying in vain to scramble up."
7744,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7745,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Yer hurt, bub?"" asked a wrinkled old apple woman, turning round on"
7746,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"her three-legged stool, and thrusting her nose inquiringly out of the"
7747,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"folds of the old brown shawl, which was wrapped around her head."
7748,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7749,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""You bet I be!"" whimpered Mike, pointing forlornly with his one"
7750,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,unoccupied finger to his bruised ankle.
7751,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7752,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Been playin' pitch-pennies, yer mis'ble young 'un!"" grinned a tall"
7753,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"boy, strolling by with his hands in his pockets, and his ferret eyes"
7754,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,on the sharp lookout for mischief.
7755,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7756,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"In a twinkling he swooped up Mike's small coin, which had rattled to"
7757,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"the pavement, and vanished with them in a struggling tangle of horse"
7758,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"cars and omnibuses before Mike finished his desperate yell of, ""Gim me"
7759,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"'um."""
7760,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7761,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"By this time a crowd had gathered about the prostrate Mike, who,"
7762,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"faint with pain, was at last lifted into the chaise of a kind-hearted"
7763,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"doctor, who was passing, and carried to his house in Bone Court."
7764,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7765,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"There we will leave Mike for a while, and look after the little pine"
7766,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,tree on its way to Meadow Home.
7767,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7768,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Such a group of round, rosy faces as were on the watch for it in the"
7769,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"great bay window of Meadow Home, peering out in the red sunset,"
7770,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"straining their eyes in the dim twilight, and peering still more"
7771,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,persistently as the stars came out through the gathering darkness!
7772,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7773,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The fire danced in the grate, and the shadows danced on the wall, and"
7774,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,the four little heads danced more and more impatiently in the window
7775,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"pane, as the cold winter night settled down on the world outside of"
7776,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Meadow Home.
7777,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7778,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""They're run away with and threw out. What will you bet, Mab?"" shouted"
7779,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Will, turning away from the window in disgust, and indulging in a"
7780,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,double somerset.
7781,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7782,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""_Thrown_, Will,"" corrected Mabel, just now more indignant with his"
7783,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,grammar than his slang.
7784,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7785,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Mabel began to clear with her sleeve an unblurred peep through the
7786,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"pane, and then pressed her nose hard against the glass."
7787,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7788,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""It's _my_ opinion,"" she said, with great pompousness, ""that the"
7789,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Christmas trees are all sold. I told Ely not to put off buying till

7791,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"without them."""
7792,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7793,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Alice poh-pohed. Alice was sitting up stiffly at a table by the fire,"
7794,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"stuffing a pin-cushion, assisted, or, more properly, impeded, by her"
7795,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"small brother Chrissy, who had offered his services, and would not"
7796,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"listen to Alice's nay. Chrissy was not handsome in any light, but by"
7797,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,the flickering firelight he looked like a little ogre. He sat
7798,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"hunched up in his chair, his knees drawn up to his nose, the sharp end"
7799,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"of his tongue curling out of the corner of his mouth, and his small"
7800,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"eyes actually crossed in the earnestness of his work, which consisted"
7801,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,in snatching chances at the stuffing with a table-spoon and a cup of
7802,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,bran.
7803,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7804,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,[Illustration: THE LITTLE SLATTERYS.]
7805,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7806,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""I hear them,"" exclaimed Mabel, springing down from the window, her"
7807,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,nose a spectacle.
7808,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7809,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Now away down stairs flew all the four, who had been wriggling for an"
7810,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,hour in the bay window.
7811,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7812,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Shut the door, Chrissy,"" nodded the dignified Alice to Chrissy, whose"
7813,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"eyes had marvellously uncrossed, and whose tongue had disappeared at"
7814,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Mabel's announcement. Chrissy drew down his knees, and obeyed. ""Spoon"
7815,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"up the bran you spilled, Chrissy,"" directed Alice, calmly stitching at"
7816,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,her pin-cushion.
7817,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7818,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,The reluctant Chrissy's obedience was less of a success this time. The
7819,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,noise of a great commotion in the hall below reached the quiet
7820,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"chamber. Chrissy, with his face twisted inquiringly first over one"
7821,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"shoulder and then over the other, spooned at random."
7822,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7823,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,The sounds came nearer. Through the hurrying of eager feet and the
7824,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,clamor of glad voices was a tap-tapping on the wainscot and a thumping
7825,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,on the oaken stairs.
7826,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7827,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""May be it's St. Nicholas?"" questioned Chrissy, spooning very"
7828,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"unsteadily, his eyes and his ears wide open."
7829,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7830,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""No; it isn't time for him. He's doing up his pack now, and they are"

7833,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Who? Where?"""
7834,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7835,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The door burst open, and in tumbled four children and the little pine"

7837,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,headlong among the family group.
7838,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7839,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""What a pretty pine!"" said Alice, calmly locking up the pin-cushion"
7840,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,in her work-box.
7841,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7842,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Now Ely, still in her fur cap and sack, rushed in excitedly among her"

7848,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7849,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Ely was purple with wrath.

7864,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7865,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Alice now lighted the gas, Ely set the pretty pine tree carefully"

7868,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7869,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Then Alice, and Mabel, and Ely went up close to the fender, and"
7870,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,whispered together about the presents Ely had brought home to put in
7871,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"the children's stockings, and Mabel helped Ely empty her great"
7872,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,stuffed-out pocket; and the fire laughed through the bars of the grate
7873,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,to see the parcels that came forth.
7874,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7875,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,By and by Mabel and Ely took the pine tree carefully down stairs into

7878,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,peep under the basket covers; but Ely thrust them all out again into
7879,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"the hall, and locked the door upon them."
7880,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7881,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Now began the Christmas adorning of the little pine tree. Such
7882,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"beautiful things as were hung upon it, and folded about it, and"
7883,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,festooned around it!
7884,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7885,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""How charming to be a pine!"" murmured the little tree, with its head"
7886,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,among the frescoed cherubs on the ceiling.
7887,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7888,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Where are you, Mabel Eliot? Light up the burners now,"" commanded Ely"
7889,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,from the top of a step-ladder.
7890,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7891,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Ely crept out from under the green baize around the foot of the pine
7892,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"tree, two pins in her mouth, a crimson smoking-cap on her dishevelled"
7893,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"head, and a pair of large-flowered toilet slippers drawn over her"
7894,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,hands.
7895,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7896,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""I crawled in behind there to see if there mightn't be a place"

7898,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,proceeding to light up.
7899,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7900,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The pine tree now saw itself reflected in the great mirror opposite,"
7901,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"and echoed the ""splendid"" of the three girls, who clapped their hands"
7902,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,at the gorgeous effect. Then the lights were put out. The silver key
7903,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"was turned in the door again, and the girls went away, leaving the"
7904,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,pine tree in darkness indeed.
7905,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7906,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The four small Eliots, after pinning up their stockings by the"
7907,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"chimney, seated themselves in their night-gowns on the hearth-rug, and"
7908,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,talked over St. Nicholas before they got into bed. Each agreed to wake

7912,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Chrissy, squinting up his eyes till nothing but two little lines of"

7916,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"So they all climbed sleepily into bed, pinning their faith on Chrissy."
7917,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7918,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The night darkened and deepened, the stars moving on in a grand"
7919,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"procession. Somewhere about midnight St. Nicholas was off on his ride,"
7920,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"galloping over the roof-tops, and knocking at every chimney-top that"
7921,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"had a knocker, just getting through at day dawn with the deal he had"
7922,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"to do. The ""eight tiny reindeer"" had barely trotted him out of sight,"
7923,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,when thousands of little children in thousands of homes began hopping
7924,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,out of bed to look in their stockings.
7925,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7926,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The Christmas morning was breaking in joy and gladness, as if the dear"

7956,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7957,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""That's so,"" chimed in the little Slatterys; and then they all fell"

7960,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The sun had climbed a long way up the sky, and was just looking in"

7963,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Slatterys' door.
7964,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7965,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Merry Christmas. May I come in?"""
7966,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,

7974,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7975,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"She had emptied her little leathern bag, laid down her gifts on a"

7979,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7980,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"I cannot stay to tell you about the Slatterys' Christmas dinner, and"
7981,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Mike perched up at the table, with brother Jack's cap on his head, and"

7983,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"stop a minute at Meadow Home, where a little golden head, with a"
7984,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"little blue velvet hat tilted atop, flits in before me at the great"
7985,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"hall door. As I went quickly through the holly and under the wreaths,"
7986,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"a little voice, in wheedling tones, called from the gallery above,--"
7987,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7988,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"""Stay to dine to dinner?"""
7989,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7990,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"At the same time a small dancing jack, dangling from somewhere"

7993,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
7994,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Chrissy clapped his hands in delight, and then dropping the string of"

8320,A DARING FEAT.,"Remarkable for its spire, the loftiest of St. Petersburg, is the"
8321,A DARING FEAT.,church of St. Peter and St. Paul. An anecdote connected with this
8322,A DARING FEAT.,"church, and not known, I believe, out of Russia, is worth telling. The"
8323,A DARING FEAT.,"spire, which rises"
8324,A DARING FEAT.,
8325,A DARING FEAT.,"""Lofty, and light, and small,"""
8326,A DARING FEAT.,
8327,A DARING FEAT.,and is probably represented in an engraving as fading away almost into
8328,A DARING FEAT.,"a point in the sky, is, in reality, terminated by a globe of"
8329,A DARING FEAT.,"considerable dimensions, on which an angel stands, supporting a large"
8330,A DARING FEAT.,cross. This angel was out of repair; and some suspicions were
8331,A DARING FEAT.,"entertained that he designed visiting, uninvoked, the surface of the"
8332,A DARING FEAT.,"earth. The affair caused some uneasiness, and the government at length"
8333,A DARING FEAT.,became greatly perplexed. To raise a scaffolding to such a height
8334,A DARING FEAT.,would cost a large sum of money; and in meditating fruitlessly on this
8335,A DARING FEAT.,"circumstance, without knowing how to act, some time was suffered to"
8336,A DARING FEAT.,elapse.
8337,A DARING FEAT.,
8338,A DARING FEAT.,"Among the crowd of gazers below, who daily turned their eyes and their"
8339,A DARING FEAT.,"thoughts towards the angel, was a mujik called Telouchkine. This man"
8340,A DARING FEAT.,"was a roofer of houses (a slater, as he would be called in countries"
8341,A DARING FEAT.,where slates were used); and his speculations by degrees assumed a
8342,A DARING FEAT.,more practical character than the idle wonders and conjectures of the
8343,A DARING FEAT.,rest of the crowd. The spire was entirely covered with sheets of
8344,A DARING FEAT.,"gilded copper, and presented to the eye a surface as smooth as if it"
8345,A DARING FEAT.,had been one mass of burnished gold. But Telouchkine knew that the
8346,A DARING FEAT.,"sheets of copper were not even uniformly closed upon each other, and,"
8347,A DARING FEAT.,"above all, that there were large nails used to fasten them, which"
8348,A DARING FEAT.,projected from the side of the spire.
8349,A DARING FEAT.,
8350,A DARING FEAT.,"Having thought on these circumstances till his mind was made up,"
8351,A DARING FEAT.,Telouchkine went to the government and offered to repair the angel
8352,A DARING FEAT.,"without scaffolding, and without assistance, on condition of being"
8353,A DARING FEAT.,reasonably paid for the time expended in the labor. The offer was
8354,A DARING FEAT.,accepted.
8355,A DARING FEAT.,
8356,A DARING FEAT.,"The day fixed for the adventure arrives. Telouchkine, provided with"
8357,A DARING FEAT.,"nothing more than a coil of ropes, ascends the spire in the interior"
8358,A DARING FEAT.,to the last window. Here he looks down at the concourse of the people
8359,A DARING FEAT.,"below, and up at the glittering ""needle,"" as it is called, tapering"
8360,A DARING FEAT.,far above his head. But his heart does not fail him; and stepping
8361,A DARING FEAT.,"gravely out upon the window, he sets about his task."
8362,A DARING FEAT.,
8363,A DARING FEAT.,"He cuts a portion of the cord in the form of two large stirrups, with"
8364,A DARING FEAT.,a loop at each end. The upper loops he fastens upon two of the
8365,A DARING FEAT.,"projecting nails above his head, and places his foot in the others."
8366,A DARING FEAT.,Then digging the fingers of one hand into the interstices of the
8367,A DARING FEAT.,"sheets of copper, he raises one of the stirrups with the other hand,"
8368,A DARING FEAT.,so as to make it catch a nail higher up. The same operation he
8369,A DARING FEAT.,"performs on behalf of the other leg, and so on alternately. And thus"
8370,A DARING FEAT.,"he climbs, nail by nail, step by step, and stirrup by stirrup, till"
8371,A DARING FEAT.,"his starting-point is undistinguished from the golden surface, and the"
8372,A DARING FEAT.,spire dwindles in his embrace till he can clasp it all round.
8373,A DARING FEAT.,
8374,A DARING FEAT.,"So far, so well. But he now reaches the ball--a globe of between nine"
8375,A DARING FEAT.,"and ten feet in circumference. The angel, the object of this visit, is"
8376,A DARING FEAT.,"above this ball, and concealed from his view by its smooth, round, and"
8377,A DARING FEAT.,"glittering expanse. Only fancy the wretch at this moment, turning up"
8378,A DARING FEAT.,"his grave eyes, and graver beard, to an obstacle that seems to defy"
8379,A DARING FEAT.,the daring and intrepidity of man!
8380,A DARING FEAT.,
8381,A DARING FEAT.,[Illustration: THE SEA.]
8382,A DARING FEAT.,
8383,A DARING FEAT.,But Telouchkine is not dismayed. He is prepared for the difficulty;
8384,A DARING FEAT.,and the means he used to surmount it exhibits the same remarkable
8385,A DARING FEAT.,simplicity as the rest of the feat.
8386,A DARING FEAT.,
8387,A DARING FEAT.,"Suspending himself in his stirrups, he girds the ""needle"" with a cord,"
8388,A DARING FEAT.,"the ends of which he fastens around his waist; and so supported, he"
8389,A DARING FEAT.,"leans gradually back, till the soles of his feet are planted against"
8390,A DARING FEAT.,"the spire. In this position, he throws, by a strong effort, a coil of"
8391,A DARING FEAT.,"cord over the ball; and so coolly and accurately is the aim taken,"
8392,A DARING FEAT.,"that at the first trial it falls in the required direction, and he"
8393,A DARING FEAT.,sees the end hang down on the opposite side.
8394,A DARING FEAT.,
8395,A DARING FEAT.,"To draw himself into his original position, to fasten the cord firmly"
8396,A DARING FEAT.,"around the globe, and with the assistance of this auxiliary to climb"
8397,A DARING FEAT.,"to the summit, is now an easy part of his task; and in a few minutes"
8398,A DARING FEAT.,"more Telouchkine stands by the side of the angel, and listens to the"
8399,A DARING FEAT.,"shout that bursts like sudden thunder from the concourse below, yet"
8400,A DARING FEAT.,comes to his ear only like a faint and hollow murmur.
8401,A DARING FEAT.,
8402,A DARING FEAT.,"The cord, which he had an opportunity of fastening properly, enabled"
8403,A DARING FEAT.,him to descend with comparative facility; and the next day he carried
8404,A DARING FEAT.,"up with him a ladder of ropes, by means of which he found it easy to"
8405,A DARING FEAT.,effect the necessary repairs.

8475,THE GIRAFFE.,beautiful form and its remarkable habits.
8476,THE GIRAFFE.,
8477,THE GIRAFFE.,"At the first sight of a giraffe, the spectator is struck by its"
8478,THE GIRAFFE.,"enormously long neck, and will naturally ask himself how it is"
8479,THE GIRAFFE.,"supported, and how its mobility is preserved. Every one who has the"
8480,THE GIRAFFE.,least acquaintance with anatomy is aware that a strong and very
8481,THE GIRAFFE.,"elastic ligament passes down the back of the neck, and acts as a strap"
8482,THE GIRAFFE.,by which the head is preserved from falling forward. In the giraffe
8483,THE GIRAFFE.,this ligament (popularly called the paxwax) is of great length and
8484,THE GIRAFFE.,"thickness, and is divided into longitudinal halves, and proceeds, not"
8485,THE GIRAFFE.,"only down the entire neck, but along the back, nearly to the tail. So"
8486,THE GIRAFFE.,powerful a band requires correspondingly large attachments; and
8487,THE GIRAFFE.,accordingly we find that the vertebræ of the shoulders send out
8488,THE GIRAFFE.,"enormously long perpendicular processes, which give to the shoulder"
8489,THE GIRAFFE.,that height which is so eminent a characteristic of the animal. To
8490,THE GIRAFFE.,these processes the ligament of the neck is fastened by accessory
8491,THE GIRAFFE.,"bands, which add both to its strength and elasticity."
8492,THE GIRAFFE.,
8493,THE GIRAFFE.,"The natives of Southern Africa make great use of this ligament, which"
8494,THE GIRAFFE.,is carefully removed and dried. When the native wishes to make a
8495,THE GIRAFFE.,"kaross, or any other article of apparel, he soaks a piece of the"
8496,THE GIRAFFE.,"ligament in water, and then beats it with a stone. This treatment"
8497,THE GIRAFFE.,"causes it to split into filaments, which can be worked to almost any"
8498,THE GIRAFFE.,"degree of fineness, and with these the native sews his leathern dress."
8499,THE GIRAFFE.,"I have now before me a piece of this Kaffir thread, as it is called."
8500,THE GIRAFFE.,"In its dry state, it is shrivelled and contracted, and no one who was"
8501,THE GIRAFFE.,not acquainted with it could guess the purpose to which it was
8502,THE GIRAFFE.,originally devoted.
8503,THE GIRAFFE.,
8504,THE GIRAFFE.,"Although the neck of the giraffe is so enormously long, it only"
8505,THE GIRAFFE.,"consists of seven vertebræ, as is indeed the rule throughout the"
8506,THE GIRAFFE.,mammalia. It seems very remarkable that in the neck of the elephant
8507,THE GIRAFFE.,and of the giraffe there should be precisely the same number of
8508,THE GIRAFFE.,"vertebræ. Such, however, is the case, and the difference in length is"
8509,THE GIRAFFE.,"caused by the great length of those bones in the giraffe, and their"
8510,THE GIRAFFE.,shortness and flatness in the elephant.
8511,THE GIRAFFE.,
8512,THE GIRAFFE.,"The giraffe is a swift animal, and even upon level ground will put a"
8513,THE GIRAFFE.,"horse to its utmost mettle; but on rough and rocky ground, especially"
8514,THE GIRAFFE.,"if the chase be directed up hill, the horse has no chance against the"
8515,THE GIRAFFE.,"giraffe, which can hop over the stones with the agility of the goat,"
8516,THE GIRAFFE.,and even leap ravines which no horse will dare to face. So energetic
8517,THE GIRAFFE.,"is the animal when chased, and so violently is the tail switched from"
8518,THE GIRAFFE.,"side to side, that the long, stiff hairs hiss sharply as they pass"
8519,THE GIRAFFE.,through the air.
8520,THE GIRAFFE.,
8521,THE GIRAFFE.,"Sometimes, but very rarely, the giraffe will miss its footing and fall"
8522,THE GIRAFFE.,"to the ground; but it recovers itself immediately, and is on its feet"
8523,THE GIRAFFE.,before much advantage can be taken of the mishap. When it lies down
8524,THE GIRAFFE.,"intentionally, it is obliged to pack up its legs in a manner which"
8525,THE GIRAFFE.,"seems extremely awkward, although the animal can lie or rise with"
8526,THE GIRAFFE.,"perfect ease; and, like the camel, it possesses callosities upon the"
8527,THE GIRAFFE.,"knees and breast, on which it rests while reposing."
8528,THE GIRAFFE.,
8529,THE GIRAFFE.,"The height of the giraffe is rather variable, but on an average is"
8530,THE GIRAFFE.,from twelve to eighteen feet.

8540,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"At Rietriverspoort, South Africa, writes Lichtenstein, we came to the"
8541,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,dwelling of a farmer named Van Wyk. Whilst we were resting our tired
8542,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"oxen, and enjoying the cool shade of the porch, Van Wyk told us the"
8543,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,following story:--
8544,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,
8545,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"""It was something more than two years ago that here, in this spot"
8546,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"where we are standing, I had to make a daring shot. My wife was"
8547,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"sitting in the house near the door, the children were playing about,"
8548,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,and I was busy doing something to my wagon on the other side of the
8549,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"house, when suddenly what should we see, on the doorstep, but the"
8550,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"shadow of a great lion darkening the bright daylight. My wife, quite"
8551,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"stunned with terror, and knowing also how dangerous it often is to try"
8552,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"and run away in such cases, remained in her place, while the children"
8553,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,took refuge upon her lap. Their cries made me aware of something
8554,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,having happened; and my astonishment and consternation may be imagined
8555,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,when I discovered what guest was blocking up my entrance to my own
8556,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,house.
8557,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,
8558,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"""The lion had not as yet seen me: but how was I, unarmed as I was, to"
8559,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,defend my family? Involuntarily I moved along the side of the house
8560,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"towards the window, which was open; and, most happily for me, I saw,"
8561,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"standing in a corner of the room near the window, a loaded gun. I was"
8562,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"able to reach it with my hand, though the window, as you see, is too"
8563,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,small for any one to get through. Still more providential was it that
8564,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"the room door happened to be open, so that I could see the whole"
8565,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"terrible scene through the window. The lion had got into the house,"
8566,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,and was looking steadfastly at my wife and children. He made a
8567,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"movement, and seemed about to spring upon them, when, feeling that"
8568,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,there was no longer any time to waste in deliberating what was to be
8569,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"done, I uttered a few encouraging words to my wife, and with God's"
8570,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"help, shot right across the room into the passage, where I struck the"
8571,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"lion in the head, so that he could not move again. The ball had passed"
8572,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"close to the hair of my little boy."""
8573,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,
8574,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,[Illustration: THE LION.]
8575,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,
8576,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"The same writer, Lichtenstein, says that the lion, like a cat, takes"
8577,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"its prey by springing upon it, and never attacks a man or animal which"
8578,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,does not attempt to run away from him without first placing himself at
8579,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"a distance of ten or twelve paces off, and measuring his spring. This"
8580,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"habit of the lion has been turned to account by hunters, who make it"
8581,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,their practice never to fire at a lion until he has so placed himself:
8582,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,long practice enabling them to know exactly where and when to hit it
8583,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,with effect while the animal is preparing for his spring. If any one
8584,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"is so unfortunate as to meet a lion unarmed, the only hope of escape"
8585,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,is presence of mind. To run away is certain destruction; if a man has
8586,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"the coolness to remain standing where he is, the lion will not attack"
8587,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,him. He will not attempt the spring if the man stands motionless as a
8588,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"statue, and looks quietly into his eyes. The erect figure of the human"
8589,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"species of itself alarms the lion, and when, in addition to this, he"
8590,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"sees his antagonist calm and unmoved, the feeling of awe is increased."
8591,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"A sudden gesture, indicative of alarm, will of course disturb this"
8592,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"impression; but if the man continues to show self-possession, the lion"
8593,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,will at last be as afraid of the man as the man of the lion. After a
8594,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"time he slowly raises himself, looks carefully round, retreats a few"
8595,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"steps, lies down again, makes a further retreat, and ends by taking"
8596,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"a rapid flight, as if his desire were to get as far out of the"
8597,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"presence of the human species as he possibly can. Indeed, we are told"
8598,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"by the settlers at the Cape, that it is not likely that the experiment"
8599,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"has been very often made. Formerly, when there were more lions to be"
8600,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"seen there than at present, and when, at the same time, the settlers"
8601,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"were inexperienced in lion-hunting, large numbers of hunters used to"
8602,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"go in chase of the lion, whom they would endeavor to entice into the"
8603,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"plain, and round whom they used to form a circle. They shot at him"
8604,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"first from one side and then from another, and if the poor animal"
8605,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"tried to break through the left side of the human wall, they would"
8606,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"attack him from the right. At present, however, experienced"
8607,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"lion-hunters generally prefer going alone after their dangerous prey,"
8608,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,and sometimes pursue him to his den. Such species of sport is always
8609,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"dangerous, however, and is often attended with fatal results. We have"
8610,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,heard from a reliable source that in many sports among the mountains
8611,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"near the Elephant River, lions are to be seen in such large numbers,"
8612,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,that on one occasion our informant saw as many as three and twenty
8613,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"together. Most of them were young, and only eight quite full grown. He"
8614,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"had just loosened his oxen on an open place, and took the rather"
8615,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,cowardly than humane course of escaping to the tents of some
8616,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,"Hottentots, and leaving his oxen to the mercy of the lions, without"
8617,THE LION ON THE THRESHOLD.,firing a shot.

8657,BARN SWALLOWS.,"When I was a youngster,--and that, let me tell you, young friends,"
8658,BARN SWALLOWS.,"was some time ago,--they used to say that swallows lived in the mud"
8659,BARN SWALLOWS.,"all winter, as the eels do. The books made no such stupid blunder;"
8660,BARN SWALLOWS.,"only the ignorant people, such as never seem to use their eyes or"
8661,BARN SWALLOWS.,their reason. It was one of the popular errors of the time. Silly as
8662,BARN SWALLOWS.,"the notion seems, it has been held by a great many respectable"
8663,BARN SWALLOWS.,persons.
8664,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8665,BARN SWALLOWS.,Possibly the error may have arisen from the fact that the moment the
8666,BARN SWALLOWS.,"swallows appear in any locality, in the spring of the year, they"
8667,BARN SWALLOWS.,"immediately search out some muddy place, where they can get materials"
8668,BARN SWALLOWS.,"for their nests. First they carry a mouthful of mud, then some threads"
8669,BARN SWALLOWS.,"of dry hay or straw, then more mud, and so on. These frequent visits"
8670,BARN SWALLOWS.,to a marshy locality might readily lead an unobserving person to
8671,BARN SWALLOWS.,"imagine that the birds came from the muddy recesses in the banks. But,"
8672,BARN SWALLOWS.,"of course, they are on a very different errand."
8673,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8674,BARN SWALLOWS.,"Having commenced their nests, the swallows rest during the warmest"
8675,BARN SWALLOWS.,"part of the day, so that the sun may dry their work, and make it hard"
8676,BARN SWALLOWS.,and strong. Then more mud is plastered on--more threads of straw; and
8677,BARN SWALLOWS.,so the industrious birds continue until the body of the nest is
8678,BARN SWALLOWS.,"completed. A nice, soft lining of fine grass or hair finishes the"
8679,BARN SWALLOWS.,"whole, and makes a summer home for both birds and their young."
8680,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8681,BARN SWALLOWS.,"Unlike most other birds, swallows often repair old nests, if the"
8682,BARN SWALLOWS.,"frosts and storms of winter have injured them, as they generally do;"
8683,BARN SWALLOWS.,and sometimes the birds come back to the same locality for several
8684,BARN SWALLOWS.,"years. They select some unexposed corner, under the eaves of a barn or"
8685,BARN SWALLOWS.,"house, if possible pretty high from the ground, and in a very few days"
8686,BARN SWALLOWS.,"the entire dwelling, lining and all, will be completed."
8687,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8688,BARN SWALLOWS.,"If unmolested, barn swallows will form quite a colony in the space of"
8689,BARN SWALLOWS.,"a few years. But, if their nests are injured or torn down, or their"
8690,BARN SWALLOWS.,"young ones are stolen away or disturbed, the birds forsake the"
8691,BARN SWALLOWS.,"locality forever. Where a number of families live together, their"
8692,BARN SWALLOWS.,"chattering, when, as the evening comes on, they are catching gnats and"
8693,BARN SWALLOWS.,"flies for supper, or feeding their young ones, is very pleasant and"
8694,BARN SWALLOWS.,"diverting. And there is music in their language, too--music which a"
8695,BARN SWALLOWS.,thoughtful person is ever glad to hear.
8696,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8697,BARN SWALLOWS.,"Last summer, when business was dull, I went on a vacation, away up"
8698,BARN SWALLOWS.,into the Granite State. While passing through the town of Unity (my
8699,BARN SWALLOWS.,little niece insists upon calling it _Utiny_--but she will speak
8700,BARN SWALLOWS.,"plainer one of these years), my attention was called to a small"
8701,BARN SWALLOWS.,"village church on the wayside. Around the entire building, under the"
8702,BARN SWALLOWS.,"eaves, were brackets, some three inches in width, and perhaps as far"
8703,BARN SWALLOWS.,apart. In the spaces thus formed were hundreds upon hundreds of
8704,BARN SWALLOWS.,"swallows' nests. Hardly a single space was left unoccupied, while many"
8705,BARN SWALLOWS.,"contained two, and sometimes three nests. Not content with the eaves,"
8706,BARN SWALLOWS.,"the colony had commenced upon the belfry, and far up towards the spire"
8707,BARN SWALLOWS.,every possible nook and corner seemed to be spoken for.
8708,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8709,BARN SWALLOWS.,I stopped to contemplate the very interesting spectacle. A villager
8710,BARN SWALLOWS.,"informed me that the colony came regularly every year, and, as near as"
8711,BARN SWALLOWS.,"could be judged, the same birds; that for ten years the birds had been"
8712,BARN SWALLOWS.,"petted by the inhabitants, and protected by all, old and young. He"
8713,BARN SWALLOWS.,"said that the swallows had all disappeared in a body, about a week"
8714,BARN SWALLOWS.,"previous to my visit, adding, ""You don't know what a lovely spectacle"
8715,BARN SWALLOWS.,"it is to witness the evolutions of these birds on a summer evening,"
8716,BARN SWALLOWS.,when they are teaching their young ones to fly. They swarm around the
8717,BARN SWALLOWS.,"building like bees, and their music is most delightful to hear."""
8718,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8719,BARN SWALLOWS.,"I could readily imagine the beauty of the scene, from the great number"
8720,BARN SWALLOWS.,"of nests, though I mean to see the colony at their devotions this"
8721,BARN SWALLOWS.,"year. ""Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for"
8722,BARN SWALLOWS.,"herself, where she may lay her young, _even thine altars_, O Lord of"
8723,BARN SWALLOWS.,"hosts, my King and my God."""
8724,BARN SWALLOWS.,
8725,BARN SWALLOWS.,It would be interesting to know where these birds go as winter
8726,BARN SWALLOWS.,"approaches. It is very easy, and perhaps very true, to say that they"
8727,BARN SWALLOWS.,"""go south."" But to what part of the south? Do they keep in a body"
8728,BARN SWALLOWS.,"there, as here? Do they have nests, and rear their young, there, as"
8729,BARN SWALLOWS.,"with us? There is a fine field for inquiry, which it is hoped some of"
8730,BARN SWALLOWS.,"our boys will go into by and by. For the present, if any of them are"
8731,BARN SWALLOWS.,"passing through Unity, let them remember the church which has its"
8732,BARN SWALLOWS.,largest congregation on the outside.

8744,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,A gentleman passing through a field observed a cow showing many
8745,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"symptoms of uneasiness, stamping with her feet and looking earnestly"
8746,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"at him. At first he feared to approach her, but afterward went toward"
8747,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"her, which seemed to please her much. She then guided him to a ditch"
8748,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,where her calf was lying helpless; and he was just in time to save it
8749,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"from death, to the no small delight of the cow. Some days after, when"
8750,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"passing through the same field, the cow came up to him as if to thank"
8751,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,him for his kindness. As among the various animals with which the
8752,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,earth abounds none is more necessary to the existence of man than the
8753,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"cow, so likewise none appears to be more extensively propagated; in"
8754,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"every part of the world it is found, large or small, according to the"
8755,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,quantity and quality of its food. There is no part of Europe where it
8756,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"grows to so large a size as in England, whose pastures are admirably"
8757,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,suited to its nature. The quantity of milk and butter varies according
8758,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,to the difference of its pasture; some cows in favorable situations
8759,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,yield twenty quarts of milk in a day.
8760,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,
8761,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"To form a just idea of the value of this animal, we ought to consider"
8762,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,that there is scarcely any part of it without its utility to man. The
8763,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"skin is manufactured into leather; the hair, mixed with lime, is used"
8764,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,in plastering walls and building houses; the bones serve as a
8765,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"substitute for ivory; when calcined, they are used by the refiners of"
8766,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,silver to separate the baser metals; and when ground and spread over
8767,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"the fields, they form a fertilizing manure. Combs, knife-handles and"
8768,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"many useful articles are made from the horns, which, when softened in"
8769,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"boiling water, become pliable, so as to be formed into lanterns--an"
8770,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,invention usually ascribed to King Alfred. We are furnished with
8771,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"candles from the tallow, and the feet afford an oil adapted to a"
8772,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"variety of purposes. Glue is made from the cartilages, gristles and"
8773,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,parings of the hide boiled in water; calves' skins are manufactured
8774,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,into vellum; saddlers and others use a fine thread prepared from the
8775,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"sinews, which is much stronger than any other equally fine. The blood,"
8776,GRATITUDE OF A COW.,"gall, etc., are used in many important manufactures."

8804,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
8805,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8806,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8807,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,It was a bitter cold day in the end of the month of January. The
8808,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"morning had been a very unpleasant one--neither frost nor snow, a sort"
8809,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"of compound of rain and sleet; but now the snow was falling fast, and"
8810,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,the clear crystals were fast hiding every shrub and plant that had a
8811,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"place in the beautiful flower garden, in front of the drawing-room"
8812,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"windows of Arundel Manor, while inside a roaring fire, that made the"
8813,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,handsomely-furnished apartment look even more than usually snug and
8814,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"comfortable, was surrounded by a family party consisting of Mrs. St."
8815,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"Clair, the three children, and uncle Godfrey."
8816,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8817,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"It was the ""children's hour,"" and his niece was trying to coax a tale"
8818,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"out of ""dear uncle,"" who did not seem much in the humor to comply with"
8819,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"her request, when mamma looked up and said, ""My dear, do not trouble"
8820,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"your uncle so. I am sure, Godfrey, that Lydia must torment you; and if"
8821,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"she does, we must send her to the nursery."""
8822,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8823,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"Poor Lydia's face fell at once. ""I am sure I did not mean to tease"
8824,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"uncle."""
8825,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8826,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Never mind, my pet; I know I promised to tell you a story to-night,"
8827,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"and was just thinking what it was to be, when my fit of musing sent"
8828,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"memory back many a long day, and revealed a scene distant many a"
8829,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"thousand miles. Now that I am fairly awake, I will show you the"
8830,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"picture of my waking dream. So up you jump;"" and Lydia, catching hold"
8831,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"of his hand, was quickly seated on her uncle's knee, her usual place"
8832,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"at story time, and throwing her arms round his neck, exclaimed,--"
8833,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8834,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""O, you dear old pet!"""
8835,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8836,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I heard,"" began uncle Godfrey, ""some boys, who shall be nameless,"
8837,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"grumbling this morning at being kept inside, for fear of catching cold"
8838,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"on such a raw day, and my thoughts instantly turned to a day similar"
8839,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"to this, and how I then prayed to be under the shelter of some"
8840,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,friendly roof; and I also thought how thankful every one ought to be
8841,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"who is able to sit at a warm fire, when it freezes hard, or when the"
8842,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,snow is covering the earth by inches every hour.
8843,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8844,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I dare say you think it fine fun to run over to the lodge and bring"
8845,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,the letters from the post-boy; at least I did when as young as you
8846,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,are; but going for letters is not always the pleasantest thing
8847,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"imaginable, as I once nearly found out to my cost."
8848,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8849,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""If you are all so anxious to hear the contents of letters from your"
8850,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"uncle Wilfred, you may fancy how eagerly he and I used to watch for"
8851,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"the arrivals of the mails at Sydney, and be sure that one or both of"
8852,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,us were certain to be at the office in Kiandra on the day it reached
8853,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"there, and with what delight we read and re-read the letter which"
8854,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,never failed to make its appearance monthly to one or other of us.
8855,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8856,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Our winter fall of snow generally began about the 12th of May, and"
8857,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,from that date till the month of October it was a matter of no small
8858,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"difficulty to get our letters at the place where we lived, a long nine"
8859,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,miles from Kiandra of a very mountainous track.
8860,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8861,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""186- was an extraordinary season. May passed, no snow--June the same,"
8862,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"only heavy, I may say, nearly constant showers of rain. 'A glorious"
8863,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"year,' the diggers called it. 'Never such a season for work since the"
8864,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,diggings broke out. Two months' work at a time when there is never any
8865,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"water. O, what a wash-up there will be in November!'"
8866,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8867,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Such was the substance of the conversation when any two of the"
8868,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"residents met, varied, perhaps, by remarks as to whether old"
8869,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"So-and-so, who had been twenty years in the district, would be right"
8870,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"in saying there was to be nine feet of snow, or whether So-and-so was"
8871,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,a better judge in saying we were to have none at all?
8872,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8873,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I was then living by myself, Wilfred being away in Sydney, and was"
8874,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"looking out for him every day, and hoping he might be back before the"
8875,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"winter fairly set in, when it was scarcely possible to travel. As I"
8876,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"said before, June had passed, and we were getting well into July, when"
8877,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,I heard that our English mail would be in Kiandra on the following
8878,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,Wednesday. It was now Friday.
8879,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8880,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""We had got a fine week for work, raining gently all the time, which"
8881,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"is what we diggers like, and no frost, which dries up the water, and"
8882,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"makes us all idle, when on Sunday the weather completely changed, and"
8883,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"very suddenly, too, as, indeed, it always did there. The wind, which"
8884,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"had been from north or east, without any warning chopped right round"
8885,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"to the south-west, and we had a strong frost. Next day was cloudy, but"
8886,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"at night frost was harder than ever, and everything with liquid in it,"
8887,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"even to the tea-pot in a room where there was a fire nearly all night,"
8888,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,was full of solid ice.
8889,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8890,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""The thermometer was down to 18° below zero in the same place; and in"
8891,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"bed, in the next room, with four pairs of new blankets, I thought I"
8892,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"should have been fairly frozen. We were hard at work all that day,"
8893,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"which was a drizzly, snowy one, everything betokening a fall of snow;"
8894,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"so, when Wednesday dawned, though not so deep as I expected, I was"
8895,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,not surprised to find more than a foot of it all over.
8896,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8897,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Down the country the floods had been dreadful; nearly all the bridges"
8898,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"had been washed away, and the roads turned into bogs, so that our"
8899,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"mails came in very irregularly, sometimes ten days behind time. You"
8900,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"may therefore imagine I was in a great worry to hear from Wilfred, my"
8901,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"last letter being a month old, as well as anxious for _home_ news. So"
8902,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"I donned my oil-skin over my blanket-coat, put on my thigh gum-boots,"
8903,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"tied my comforter round my neck and up over my ears, and pulling my"
8904,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"south-wester on, prepared to face the weather."
8905,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8906,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I found the walk into town, though very heavy, not so bad as I"
8907,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"expected, and arrived safely, without any mishaps, but rather tired"
8908,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"and uncomfortably moist, it being a sort of drizzle all the way; but a"
8909,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"letter from Wilfred, saying he would not leave for some time, and so"
8910,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"would not be caught in this storm, and the perusal of a kind one from"
8911,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"'the old country' soon made me forget my discomfort, and I spent a"
8912,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,pleasant evening at a friend's.
8913,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8914,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""At bed-time it was a beautiful starry night; but I did not altogether"
8915,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"fancy it. There was a kind of half soft feel through the frost, that"
8916,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"sounded to me like a change, and the thought of the morrow's walk was"
8917,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,not a pleasant one; but there was no use forestalling what might never
8918,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"be. So to bed and to sleep; but ere my eyes were well closed, the wind"
8919,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"began to whistle round the corner of the house, and--hallo--what's"
8920,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"that! Big drops of rain, and lumps of earth and gravel, were pelting"
8921,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,the panes of glass.
8922,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8923,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""A few minutes there was a lull--a dead silence--when flash!"
8924,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"crash!--the room was in a blaze of light, and at the same instant the"
8925,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"thunder made the very bed shake again, and also made my heart rise to"
8926,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"my mouth. Listening earnestly for some time, and no further"
8927,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"disturbances occurring, I began, after thanking a kind Providence for"
8928,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"his protection, to think over the matter, and came to the conclusion"
8929,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"that at last we were in for a downright fall, this being the third"
8930,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"time that, to my knowledge, such had been preceded by a single clap of"
8931,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,thunder.
8932,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8933,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Next day the snow came down in earnest; and as it was drifting in"
8934,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"every direction, I took the advice of my friends, and quietly stopped"
8935,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"where I was. Large, feathery flakes fell unceasingly all the"
8936,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"afternoon, and by night there was fully two feet in the town; but as"
8937,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"it looked a little better on Friday afternoon, and my dog, cat, and"
8938,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"fowls could get nothing to eat until my return, I determined to make a"
8939,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"start, though against the opinions of most of the town's people."
8940,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8941,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""When I left Kiandra there was a dense fog, which shortly changed,"
8942,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"first to a light, and then to a heavy snow; and by the time I dragged"
8943,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"myself the mile to the top of the mountain, it was coming down, and no"
8944,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,mistake!
8945,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8946,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""It was impossible to see one yard in any direction, and my legs were"
8947,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,already beginning to _talk_; but it was too late to think of turning.
8948,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"I had had only to fight through one extra deep drift as yet, and knew"
8949,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,the road hitherto well; but now I had to turn off from where the track
8950,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"lay hid, and had not gone far when my difficulties fairly began, and I"
8951,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,was quickly ploughing my way through some five or six feet of snow.
8952,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8953,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Half an hour's hard work found me clear of that, and for a couple of"
8954,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,miles everything went swimmingly. The snow was here firm enough to
8955,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"bear my weight, although now and again, bump! down I went through the"
8956,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"crust, nearly jerking my joints out. The nearer home the deeper got"
8957,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"the snow, and, of course, so much the more tired I felt. The main"
8958,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,creek to be crossed was hidden entirely; and as its exact whereabouts
8959,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"was not very easily guessed at, you may depend it was not a pleasant"
8960,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"sensation to plump down and find myself up to the neck. Luckily, the"
8961,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"water was no depth, and as my boots were tight and long, a hard"
8962,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,scramble pulled me out of my first trouble.
8963,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8964,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""A short rest, and I was again on my way; but it took me a good many"
8965,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"hours to get the next three or four miles, even though I met no more"
8966,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,serious difficulty than some very heavy drifts. I was getting very
8967,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"tired, and hungry, too, and you may fancy it was no joke wading the"
8968,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"snow, never less than two feet, lucky if not going past the knees at"
8969,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"every step; but at last I was in a mess, and how to get out of it I"
8970,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"knew not. The look of the country, when a lull gave me the chance of"
8971,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"seeing, showed I was off my road; and when I felt I was lost, my"
8972,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,thoughts were anything but satisfactory.
8973,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8974,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I knew not which way to turn, so sat down to think it over, and was"
8975,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"looking around as well as the drifting snow would permit, when coming"
8976,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,along my tracks was a large yellow dog. My heart gave a bound of
8977,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"delight, and jumping up, I let a 'cooey,'[A] to tell its master that"
8978,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"some one was in the same predicament, as I doubted not he was."
8979,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8980,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""Slowly a minute or two passed, but no reply to my communication."
8981,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"Alas! all was silence, and I then saw, by its pointed ears and bushy"
8982,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"tail, that it was a dingo, or native dog, which was running my"
8983,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,footsteps. It was no use sitting where I was. So on I started in the
8984,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"direction I fancied, every minute feeling more and more fagged, and"
8985,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"when at last darkness set in, was almost inclined to give up."
8986,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8987,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""My yellow friend followed me for some time at a respectful distance;"
8988,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"and though the dingo is a sneaking coward, still, had sleep"
8989,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"overpowered me, he might have been tempted to try how I tasted, as he"
8990,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"must have been hungry to come so close to me as he did. So, although I"
8991,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"never had any fear of such an event actually occurring, I was not at"
8992,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"all sorry when he trotted off, his tail, as usual, between his legs,"
8993,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"to join some of his companions, whose unearthly howls he heard at no"
8994,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,great distance; there must have been five or six.
8995,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
8996,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I felt really glad they came no nearer, as a mob of them are very"
8997,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"daring; and I have known them, when well starved for a week or two,"
8998,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"kill calves, and even colts, when the mothers were weak and could not"
8999,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,fight for them. But it was not very long before I found that they were
9000,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"not after me, as I nearly stumbled against a mare and colt belonging"
9001,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"to myself, that were standing under a tree, and whinnied as I spoke."
9002,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"We had sent all our horses away two months ago but this one, as she"
9003,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"could not be found, and we thought she was dead. The poor thing could"
9004,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"not have tasted food for days; but what could I do but pity the pair,"
9005,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,and feel that their end was to be food for the _warregals_ (native
9006,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,dogs).
9007,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9008,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""As I had now been walking seven or eight hours, and hard at it all"
9009,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"the time, I could see nothing for it but to yield to necessity, as"
9010,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"sleep was fast overpowering me, when I distinctly heard the bark of a"
9011,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"dog, which I felt confident was my old watch, 'Jack.' My spirits rose"
9012,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"at once, and again I was alive, and pushed in the direction of the"
9013,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,welcome sound.
9014,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9015,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""At the same time I caught a glimpse of a cluster of trees, whose"
9016,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"peculiar shape I had often remarked, which told me where I was; and"
9017,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,this fact was also quickly proved by my plunging into an old
9018,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,prospecting hole--the only one in the neighborhood. It was about six
9019,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"feet deep, and full of snow and water. I thought I was lost, as the"
9020,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"frozen slush went down my back, and that I, who had been picked out of"
9021,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"the Canton River, in a dark night, when the tide ran six knots an"
9022,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"hour, was fated to be drowned in a filthy pot-hole."
9023,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9024,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""But, luckily, such was not my lot on the present occasion, as, after"
9025,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"many a failure, I managed to pull myself out, my boots full of water,"
9026,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"and my whole body nearly numb from the cold. Luckily, the house was"
9027,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,only half a mile off.
9028,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9029,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""I reached it in safety, and just in time, as my feet were all but"
9030,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"frost-bitten, when I should have been fortunate to lose only a few of"
9031,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"my toes, as I knew a man here who had _both_ legs cut off in"
9032,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,consequence of a severe frost-bite.
9033,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9034,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""As it was, I was a sorry figure; my clothes were like a board, my"
9035,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"socks were in a similar state, while icicles hung in festoons from my"
9036,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"hair and beard. But, when at last I managed to open the door, and get"
9037,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"a light, one or two rough towels, and some ten minutes' hard rubbing,"
9038,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,soon put a glow of heat over my whole body; and by the time I turned
9039,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"into bed, after a cup of scalding hot coffee (I was too hungry to"
9040,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"eat), my misfortunes were forgotten, and all I felt was thankfulness"
9041,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"for having reached my house, which seems to me, even now, to have been"
9042,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"a very doubtful matter, had 'Jack' not barked when he did."
9043,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9044,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""See how many things turned out all for my good--the mare and the colt"
9045,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"in the snow, the dingo running after her through hunger, and my dog"
9046,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"barking at it, showed me where my house was, when I was fairly lost,"
9047,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"and thus saved my life, and enabled me to spin you this yarn, which I"
9048,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,must now finish by saying that since that time I am always glad to
9049,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"have a warm house to shelter me in such weather as this, and cannot"
9050,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"help thinking that if any boys had ever been placed in my predicament,"
9051,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,they would only be too thankful to remain inside on such a day as
9052,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"this, without requiring their mother to order them to do so."""
9053,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9054,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""But what about the poor mare? Did she die? and did the wild dogs eat"
9055,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"the colt?"""
9056,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,
9057,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"""O, I almost forgot to tell you that, to my astonishment, in two or"
9058,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"three days, when the snow hardened a bit, the pair found their way"
9059,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"home, and I, after a deal of trouble, got them to the banks of the"
9060,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"Tumut River, which, although only a couple of miles away, was so many"
9061,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"hundred feet lower, that they could paw away the snow, and so got"
9062,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,grass enough to live till spring when they soon got fat. The little
9063,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"colt I named 'Snowdrop,' and when she was old enough, broke her in;"
9064,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,and many a good gallop we had over the place where she and her mother
9065,AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.,"neighed to me on that dark and dismal night."""

9163,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9164,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9165,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"""Now, just one good cuddle,"" said little six-year-old Freddie, ""and"
9166,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"then I'll be ready for school;"" and he curled himself up like a young"
9167,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"Turk in his mother's lap, and nestled there in a very enjoyable way."
9168,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9169,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"She was sitting by the dining-room window; it was open, and a pitcher"
9170,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,of wild phlox and pink-and-white wake-robins stood in it. While they
9171,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"sat there they saw Uncle Rube, who lives over on the hillside, coming"
9172,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"along the crooked path with a basket on his arm. His head was down,"
9173,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,and he was thinking so intently that he did not hear the steps behind
9174,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"him of his young dog, Stephen."
9175,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9176,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"Now, Rube means to make the best dog in the world of Stephen--the"
9177,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,playful little puppy!--and he never permits him to follow him anywhere
9178,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"unless by special invitation. About once a week he will say to him,"
9179,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"""Stevie, would you like to go to your grandfather's with me? Come on,"
9180,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"then;"" and here they will come, the puppy so glad that his gait is"
9181,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"more awkward than ever, his fat body, twisted out of all shape,"
9182,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"wriggling along, while his tail will flap about in every direction and"
9183,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,his ears look like wilted cabbage-leaves.
9184,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9185,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"""He doesn't know Stevie is behind him, does he, ma? and now let's"
9186,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"watch and see what they will both do when they find out."" So they"
9187,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,snugged down by the window and tittered and watched and anticipated
9188,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,rare fun.
9189,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9190,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,Uncle Rube was whispering to himself and nodding his head and making
9191,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"gesticulations with his open hand, while Stephen trotted with his"
9192,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"little soft, careful feet behind him, smelling of the ground, and"
9193,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,thinking green grass with the dew sparkling on it was just made
9194,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,purposely for dogs to admire.
9195,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9196,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,Just as Rube came to the big gate and stopped to unlatch it he heard a
9197,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"little whiffy breathing behind him, and then he looked and saw"
9198,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"Stephen. He was very much surprised; but as he never scolded the dog,"
9199,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"he simply said, in a very earnest way, ""Steve, I am astonished! You go"
9200,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"right back home immediately. You're a great boy, indeed, to sneak"
9201,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"along without ever being invited! I didn't want you, sir, or I'd have"
9202,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"told you so. Now go right back again."""
9203,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9204,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"Oh, it was _so_ funny! Stephen just threw his head back and whirled on"
9205,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"his heels, and ran with all his might down the crooked path."
9206,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,
9207,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"Then the school-bell rang, and Fred's mother kissed him"
9208,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"""good-morning,"" and he started off with his books, and as he turned"
9209,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"round the corner his white teeth showed prettily as, half laughing, he"
9210,FRED AND DOG STEPHEN.,"said to himself in wonderment, ""_Dear little Stevie dog! he just ran"

9291,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I'm so glad to-morrow is Christmas, because I'm going to have lots"
9292,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"of presents."""
9293,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9294,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""So am I glad, though I don't expect any presents but a pair of"

9296,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9297,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""And so am I; but I shan't have any presents at all."""
9298,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9299,THE FAIRY BIRD.,As the three little girls trudged home from school they said these
9300,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"things, and as Tilly spoke, both the others looked at her with pity"
9301,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"and some surprise; for she spoke cheerfully, and they wondered how she"
9302,THE FAIRY BIRD.,could be happy when she was so poor she could have no presents on
9303,THE FAIRY BIRD.,Christmas.
9304,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9305,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Don't you wish you could find a purse full of money right here in the"
9306,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"path?"" said Kate, the child who was going to have ""lots of presents."""
9307,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9308,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""O, don't I, if I could keep it honestly!"" And Tilly's eyes shone at"
9309,THE FAIRY BIRD.,the very thought.
9310,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9311,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""What would you buy?"" asked Bessy, rubbing her cold hands, and longing"
9312,THE FAIRY BIRD.,for her mittens.
9313,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9314,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I'd buy a pair of large, warm blankets, a load of wood, a shawl for"
9315,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"mother, and a pair of shoes for me; and if there was enough left, I'd"
9316,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"give Bessy a new hat, and then she needn't wear Ben's old felt one,"""
9317,THE FAIRY BIRD.,answered Tilly.
9318,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9319,THE FAIRY BIRD.,The girls laughed at that; but Bessy pulled the funny hat over her
9320,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"ears, and said she was much obliged, but she'd rather have candy."
9321,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9322,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Let's look, and may be we _can_ find a purse. People are always going"
9323,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"about with money at Christmas time, and some one may lose it here,"""
9324,THE FAIRY BIRD.,said Kate.
9325,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9326,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"So, as they went along the snowy road, they looked about them, half in"
9327,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"earnest, half in fun. Suddenly Tilly sprang forward, exclaiming,--"
9328,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9329,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I see it! I've found it!"""
9330,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9331,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"The others followed, but all stopped disappointed, for it wasn't a"
9332,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"purse; it was only a little bird. It lay upon the snow, with its wings"
9333,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"spread and feebly fluttering, as if too weak to fly. Its little feet"
9334,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"were benumbed with cold; its once bright eyes were dull with pain, and"
9335,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"instead of a blithe song, it could only utter a faint chirp now and"
9336,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"then, as if crying for help."
9337,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9338,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Nothing but a stupid old robin. How provoking!"" cried Kate, sitting"
9339,THE FAIRY BIRD.,down to rest.
9340,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9341,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I shan't touch it; I found one once, and took care of it, and the"
9342,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"ungrateful thing flew away the minute it was well,"" said Bessy,"
9343,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"creeping under Kate's shawl, and putting her hands under her chin to"
9344,THE FAIRY BIRD.,warm them.
9345,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9346,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Poor little birdie! How pitiful he looks, and how glad he must be to"
9347,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"see some one coming to help him! I'll take him up gently, and carry"
9348,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"him home to mother. Don't be frightened, dear; I'm your friend."" And"
9349,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Tilly knelt down in the snow, stretching her hand to the bird with the"
9350,THE FAIRY BIRD.,tenderest pity in her face.
9351,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9352,THE FAIRY BIRD.,Kate and Bessy laughed.
9353,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9354,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Don't stop for that thing; it's getting late and cold. Let's go on,"
9355,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"and look for the purse,"" they said, moving away."
9356,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9357,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""You wouldn't leave it to die!"" cried Tilly. ""I'd rather have the bird"
9358,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"than the money; so I shan't look any more. The purse wouldn't be mine,"
9359,THE FAIRY BIRD.,and I should only be tempted to keep it; but this poor thing will
9360,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"thank and love me, and I'm _so_ glad I came in time!"" Gently lifting"
9361,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"the bird, Tilly felt its tiny cold claws cling to her hand, and saw"
9362,THE FAIRY BIRD.,its dim eyes brighten as it nestled down with a grateful chirp.
9363,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9364,THE FAIRY BIRD.,[Illustration: THE FAIRY BIRD.]
9365,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9366,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Now I've got a Christmas present, after all,"" she said, smiling, as"
9367,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"they walked on. ""I always wanted a bird, and this one will be such a"
9368,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"pretty pet for me!"""
9369,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9370,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""He'll fly away the first chance he gets, and die, anyhow; so you'd"
9371,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"better not waste your time over him,"" said Bessy."
9372,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9373,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""He can't pay you for taking care of him, and my mother says it isn't"
9374,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"worth while to help folks that can't help us,"" added Kate."
9375,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9376,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""My mother says, 'Do as you'd be done by;' and I'm sure I'd like any"
9377,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"one to help me, if I was dying of cold and hunger. 'Love your neighbor"
9378,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"as yourself,' is another of her sayings. This bird is my little"
9379,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"neighbor, and I'll love him and care for him, as I often wish our rich"
9380,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"neighbor would love and care for us,"" answered Tilly, breathing her"
9381,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"warm breath over the benumbed bird, who looked up at her with"
9382,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"confiding eyes, quick to feel and know a friend."
9383,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9384,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""What a funny girl you are!"" said Kate, ""caring for that silly bird,"
9385,THE FAIRY BIRD.,and talking about loving your neighbor in that sober way. Mr. King
9386,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"don't care a bit for you, and never will, though he knows how poor you"
9387,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"are; so I don't think your plan amounts to much."""
9388,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9389,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I believe it, though, and shall do my part, any way. Good night. I"
9390,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"hope you'll have a merry Christmas, and lots of pretty things,"""
9391,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"answered Tilly, as they parted."
9392,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9393,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Her eyes were full, and she felt _so_ poor as she went on alone"
9394,THE FAIRY BIRD.,towards the little old house where she lived! It would have been so
9395,THE FAIRY BIRD.,pleasant to know that she was going to have some of the pretty things
9396,THE FAIRY BIRD.,all children love to find in their full stockings on Christmas
9397,THE FAIRY BIRD.,morning! and pleasanter still to have been able to give her mother
9398,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"something nice. So many comforts were needed, and there was no hope of"
9399,THE FAIRY BIRD.,getting them; for they could barely get food and fire.
9400,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9401,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Never mind, birdie; we'll make the best of what we have, and be merry"
9402,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"in spite of everything. _You_ shall have a happy Christmas, any way;"
9403,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"and I know God won't forget us, if every one else does."""
9404,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9405,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"She stopped a minute to wipe her eyes, and lean her cheek against the"
9406,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"bird's soft breast, finding great comfort in the little creature,"
9407,THE FAIRY BIRD.,though it could only love her--nothing more.
9408,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9409,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""See, mother, what a nice present I've found!"" she cried, going in"
9410,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"with a cheery face, that was like sunshine in the dark room."
9411,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9412,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I'm glad of that, deary; for I haven't been able to get my little"
9413,THE FAIRY BIRD.,girl anything but a rosy apple. Poor bird! Give it some of your warm
9414,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"bread and milk."""
9415,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9416,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Why, mother, what a big bowlful! I'm afraid you gave me all the"
9417,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"milk,"" said Tilly, smiling over the nice steaming supper that stood"
9418,THE FAIRY BIRD.,ready for her.
9419,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9420,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I've had plenty, dear. Sit down and dry your wet feet, and put the"
9421,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"bird in my basket on this warm flannel."""
9422,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9423,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Tilly peeped into the closet, and saw nothing there but dry bread."
9424,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9425,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Mother's given me all the milk, and is going without her tea, 'cause"
9426,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"she knows I'm hungry. Now I'll surprise her, and she shall have a good"
9427,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"supper too. She is going to split wood, and I'll fix it while she's"
9428,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"gone."""
9429,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9430,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"So Tilly put down the old teapot, carefully poured out a part of the"
9431,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"milk, and from her pocket produced a great plummy bunn, that one of"
9432,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"the school children had given her, and she had saved for her mother. A"
9433,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"slice of the dry bread was nicely toasted, and the bit of butter set"
9434,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"by for her to put on it. When her mother came in, there was the table"
9435,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"drawn up in a warm place, a hot cup of tea ready, and Tilly and birdie"
9436,THE FAIRY BIRD.,waiting for her.
9437,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9438,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Such a poor little supper, and yet such a happy one! for love,"
9439,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"charity, and contentment were guests there, and that Christmas eve was"
9440,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"a blither one than that up at the great house, where lights shone,"
9441,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"fires blazed, a great tree glittered, and music sounded, as the"
9442,THE FAIRY BIRD.,children danced and played.
9443,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9444,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""We must go to bed early; for we've only wood enough to last over"
9445,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"to-morrow. I shall be paid for my work the day after, and then we can"
9446,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"get some,"" said Tilly's mother, as they sat by the fire."
9447,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9448,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""If my bird was only a fairy bird, and would give us three wishes, how"
9449,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"nice it would be! Poor dear, he can't give me anything; but it's no"
9450,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"matter,"" answered Tilly, looking at the robin, who lay in the basket,"
9451,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"with his head under his wing, a mere little feathery bunch."
9452,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9453,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""He can give you one thing, Tilly--the pleasure of doing good. That is"
9454,THE FAIRY BIRD.,one of the sweetest things in life; and the poor can enjoy it as well
9455,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"as the rich."""
9456,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9457,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"As her mother spoke, with her tired hand softly stroking her little"
9458,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"daughter's hair, Tilly suddenly started, and pointed to the window,"
9459,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"saying, in a frightened whisper,--"
9460,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9461,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I saw a face--a man's face--looking in. It's gone now; but I truly"
9462,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"saw it."""
9463,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9464,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Some traveller attracted by the light, perhaps; I'll go and see."" And"
9465,THE FAIRY BIRD.,Tilly's mother went to the door.
9466,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9467,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"No one was there. The wind blew cold, the stars shone, the snow lay"
9468,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"white on field and wood, and the Christmas moon was glittering in the"
9469,THE FAIRY BIRD.,sky.
9470,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9471,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""What sort of a face was it?"" asked Tilly's mother, coming back."
9472,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9473,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""A pleasant sort of face, I think; but I was so startled, I don't"
9474,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"quite know what it was like. I wish we had a curtain there,"" said"
9475,THE FAIRY BIRD.,Tilly.
9476,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9477,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""I like to have our light shine out in the evening; for the road is"
9478,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"dark and lonely just here, and the twinkle of our lamp is pleasant to"
9479,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"people's eyes as they go by. We can do so little for our neighbors, I"
9480,THE FAIRY BIRD.,am glad to cheer the way for them. Now put these poor old shoes to
9481,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"dry, and go to bed, deary; I'll come soon."""
9482,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9483,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Tilly went, taking her bird with her to sleep in his basket near by,"
9484,THE FAIRY BIRD.,lest he should be lonely in the night.
9485,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9486,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"Soon the little house was dark and still, and no one saw the Christmas"
9487,THE FAIRY BIRD.,spirits at their work that night.
9488,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9489,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"When Tilly opened the door the next morning, she gave a loud cry,"
9490,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"clapped her hands, and then stood still, quite speechless with wonder"
9491,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"and delight. There, before the door, lay a great pile of wood, all"
9492,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"ready to burn, a big bundle and a basket, with a lovely nosegay of"
9493,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"winter roses, holly, and evergreen tied to the handle."
9494,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9495,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""O, mother, did the fairies do it?"" cried Tilly, pale with her"
9496,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"happiness, as she seized the basket while her mother took in the"
9497,THE FAIRY BIRD.,bundle.
9498,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9499,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Yes, dear; the best and dearest fairy in the world, called 'Charity.'"
9500,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"She walks abroad at Christmas time, does beautiful deeds like this,"
9501,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"and does not stay to be thanked,"" answered her mother, with full eyes,"
9502,THE FAIRY BIRD.,as she undid the parcel.
9503,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9504,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"There they were, the warm, thick blankets, the comfortable shawl, the"
9505,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"new shoes, and, best of all, a pretty winter hat for Bessy. The basket"
9506,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"was full of good things to eat, and on the flowers lay a paper,"
9507,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"saying,--"
9508,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9509,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""For the little girl who loves her neighbor as herself."""
9510,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9511,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"""Mother, I really think my bird is a fairy bird, and all these"
9512,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"splendid things come out from him,"" said Tilly, laughing and crying"
9513,THE FAIRY BIRD.,with joy.
9514,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9515,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"It really did seem so; for, as she spoke, the robin flew to the table,"
9516,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"hopped to the nosegay, and perching among the roses, began to chirp"
9517,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"with all his little might. The sun streamed in on flowers, bird, and"
9518,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"happy child, and no one saw a shadow glide away from the window. No"
9519,THE FAIRY BIRD.,one ever knew that Mr. King had seen and heard the little girls the
9520,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"night before, or dreamed that the rich neighbor had learned a lesson"
9521,THE FAIRY BIRD.,from the poor neighbor.
9522,THE FAIRY BIRD.,
9523,THE FAIRY BIRD.,And Tilly's bird _was_ a fairy bird; for by her love and tenderness
9524,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"to the helpless thing, she brought good gifts to herself, happiness to"
9525,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"the unknown giver of them, and a faithful little friend, who did not"
9526,THE FAIRY BIRD.,"fly away, but staid with her till the snow was gone, making summer for"
9527,THE FAIRY BIRD.,her in the winter time.

9540,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Among the most rapacious and dangerous animals of North America, is"
9541,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the wolf, commonly called the coyote (pronounced ky-_o_-te) in some of"
9542,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,the Southern and Western States. The wolves--far more numerous in the
9543,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"United States than in Europe--are, perhaps, more horrible in aspect"
9544,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"than those of the old world. Along desert paths, on the prairies or in"
9545,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the woods, the wolf, the ghoul of the animal race, presents itself to"
9546,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the traveller, with its slavering jaws and flashing eyes, uttering a"
9547,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"growl, which is the usual sign of cowardice blended with impudence."
9548,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"""The coyote,"" says a recent writer, ""is a living, breathing allegory"
9549,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"of Want. He is always poor, out of luck, and friendless."""
9550,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9551,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"It is very difficult to catch coyotes in a trap, but they are"
9552,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,frequently hunted down with horses and dogs. Their coat is of a dull
9553,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"reddish color, mixed with gray and white hairs. Such is their ordinary"
9554,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"condition, but like other animals they display varieties. Their bushy"
9555,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"tail, black at the tip, is nearly as long as one third of their body."
9556,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"They resemble the dogs which one sees in the Indian wigwams, and which"
9557,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,are certainly descended from this species. They are found in the
9558,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"regions between the Mississippi and the Pacific, and in Southern"
9559,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Mexico. They travel in packs like jackals, and pursue deer, buffaloes,"
9560,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,and other animals which they hope to master. They do not venture to
9561,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"attack buffaloes in herds, but they follow the latter in large packs,"
9562,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"watching till a laggard--a young calf or an old bull, for"
9563,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,instance--may fall out; then they dart upon it and tear it to pieces.
9564,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"They accompany parties of sportsmen or travellers, prowl round"
9565,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"deserted camps, and devour the fragments they find there. At times"
9566,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"they will enter a camp during the night, and seize lumps of meat on"
9567,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,which the emigrants calculated for their morning meal. These robberies
9568,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"sometimes exasperate the victims, and, growing less saving of their"
9569,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"powder and shot, they pursue them till they have rubbed out the"
9570,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,mess-number of several.
9571,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9572,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,This breed of wolves is the most numerous of all the carnivora in
9573,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"North America, and it is for this reason that the coyotes often suffer"
9574,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"from hunger. Then, but only then, they eat corn, roots, and"
9575,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"vegetables--in short, anything that will save them from death by"
9576,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,starvation.
9577,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9578,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The coyote is ignorant of any feeling of sympathy, and for this reason"
9579,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"inspires none. Here is an anecdote, however, which proves that this"
9580,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,quadruped thief of the wood is capable of feeling a certain degree of
9581,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"sensibility of the nerves, at any rate, if not of the heart. This"
9582,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"story was told me under canvas, while we were hunting with the Pawnee"
9583,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,Indians.
9584,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9585,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"During the first period of the colonization of Kentucky, the coyotes"
9586,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"were so numerous in the prairie to the south of that state, that the"
9587,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,inhabitants did not dare to leave their houses unless armed to the
9588,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,teeth. The women and children were strictly confined in-doors. The
9589,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,coyotes by which the country was infested belonged to the herd whose
9590,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"coat is dark gray, a very numerous species in the northern district,"
9591,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,in the heart of the dense forests and unexplored mountains of the
9592,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,Green River.
9593,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9594,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The village of Henderson, situated at the left bank of the Ohio, near"
9595,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"its confluence with Green River, was the spot most frequented by these"
9596,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,depredators.
9597,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9598,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The pigs, calves, and sheep of the planters paid a heavy tax to these"
9599,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"voracious animals. Several times in the depth of winter, when the snow"
9600,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"covered the ground, and the flocks were kept in the stalls, the"
9601,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,starving coyotes attacked human beings; and more than one belated
9602,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"farmer, returning home at night, found himself surrounded by a raging"
9603,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"pack, from whose teeth he had great difficulty in defending himself."
9604,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9605,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Among the many startling adventures I have heard narrated, not one"
9606,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"made a greater impression on me than that of which Richard, the old"
9607,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"negro fiddler, was the hero, and which I will tell you."
9608,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9609,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Richard was what is called a ""good old good-for-nothing darky."" The"
9610,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,whole district allowed that he had no other merit beyond that of
9611,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"sawing the fiddle; and this merit, which is not one in our own eyes,"
9612,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"was highly valued, however, by all the colored people, and even by the"
9613,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,whites who lived for a distance of forty miles round. One thing is
9614,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,certain--that no festival could be held without Fiddler Dick being
9615,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,invited to it.
9616,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9617,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Marriages, christenings, parties prolonged till dawn, which are called"
9618,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"""break-downs"" in the United States, could not take place without the"
9619,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"aid of his fiddle; and though the negro minstrel was old, and a good"
9620,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,deal of his black wool was absent from the place where the wool ought
9621,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"to grow, still Richard was no less welcome wherever he presented"
9622,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"himself, with his instrument wrapped up in a ragged old handkerchief"
9623,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"under his arm, and a knotted stick in his hand."
9624,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9625,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Old Richard was the property of one of the Hendersons, a member of the"
9626,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,family that gave its name to this Kentucky county and village. His
9627,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"master had a liking for him, owing to his obedient and original"
9628,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"character, and the slave, instead of tilling the soil, was at liberty"
9629,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,to do whatever he thought proper. No one raised any objection to this
9630,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"tolerance, for Richard, whom his master was used to call a necessary"
9631,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"evil, had before all the talent of keeping the negroes of the"
9632,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,plantation in good humor by means of his fiddle.
9633,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9634,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Richard, who understood all the importance of his exalted functions,"
9635,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"knew nothing but his duty, and was remarkably punctual whenever those"
9636,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,who honored him with their confidence let him know that his services
9637,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"were required. In this respect the merest trifle irritated him, and"
9638,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,any vexation or disturbance rendered him ferocious.
9639,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9640,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Despite the proverbial timidity attributed to geniuses, old Dick"
9641,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"displayed a touch of the hyena whenever, at any of the negro festivals"
9642,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"presided over by him, anything or anybody offended etiquette or the"
9643,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"proprieties. As for Dick, he never forgot himself in the slightest"
9644,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"degree, and whenever he was called upon to undertake the duties he"
9645,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"performed so well, he had never once kept the company waiting. And yet"
9646,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,one day--poor Dick! The following narrative will show that it was not
9647,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,by his own fault that he arrived too late at his appointment.
9648,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9649,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,A wedding of colored people was about to come off on a plantation
9650,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,about six miles from the one where the fiddler lived. In order that
9651,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the feast might be perfect, old Dick had been invited, and he was"
9652,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,unanimously appointed master of the ceremonies. It was during the
9653,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"winter; the cold was excessive, and the snow, which had fallen"
9654,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"incessantly for three days, covered the ground to a depth of several"
9655,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,feet.
9656,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9657,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"While all Mr. Henderson's negroes, with their master's previous"
9658,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"permission, hastened to the spot where pleasure called them, the ebony"
9659,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Apollo was arranging his toilet with peculiar delight. A white shirt,"
9660,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"a collar as immoderately long in front as it was high in the neck,--so"
9661,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,that Dick's head resembled a block of coal in a sheet of white
9662,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"paper,--a blue coat with gilt buttons, and long tails that reached to"
9663,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"his heels,--a present from his master,--a red silk cravat fringed at"
9664,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the ends, a green waistcoat ornamented with an orange patch at the"
9665,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"spot where the watch-pocket formerly was, boots which had seen their"
9666,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"best days, and a wide-awake hat,--such was the elegant and excessively"
9667,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"fashionable attire of Dick, the old black fiddler, who, when dressed"
9668,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"in these rags, believed himself as handsome as Adonis."
9669,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9670,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,After taking a parting glance at the piece of looking-glass held by
9671,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"three nails on the wall of his bedroom, and favoring himself with a"
9672,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"smile that expressed a personal satisfaction, Richard took his fiddle"
9673,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,under his arm and set out.
9674,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9675,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The moon was shining over his head, the stars sparkled--to use the"
9676,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"fiddler's picturesque expression--like ""gilt nails driven into the"
9677,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"ceiling of the firmament by an audacious upholsterer."" No sound could"
9678,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"be heard, save the crackling of the snow beneath Richard's feet, as he"
9679,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,put them down with the heaviness of old age. The road he had to follow
9680,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,was very narrow; its complicated windings passed through a dense
9681,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"forest which the axe had not yet assailed, and whose depths were still"
9682,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,as entirely unknown as at the period when the Redskins were the sole
9683,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,owners of the territory. This track could only be followed by a
9684,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,pedestrian; no cart road existed for several miles round.
9685,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9686,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,The profound solitude of this road must infallibly produce its
9687,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,effect--that of fear or apprehension--on a being belonging to the
9688,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,human race; but at this moment the old man was so deeply plunged in
9689,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,thought that nothing could make him forget the anxiety he felt at not
9690,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,arriving in time at the place where he was expected. He doubled his
9691,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,pace as he thought of the furious glances that would be bestowed on
9692,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"him by those whose joys his absence retarded, and he regretted the"
9693,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,time he had spent in giving an extra polish to his coat buttons and in
9694,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,pulling up the two splendid points of his shirt collar.
9695,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9696,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"While thinking of the reproaches that menaced him, old Dick looked up,"
9697,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,and the moon shining above his head proved to him that he was even
9698,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,more behindhand than he had supposed. His legs then began moving like
9699,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the wheels of a locomotive, so as to keep him constantly ahead of"
9700,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,certain black shadows which seemed to be following his every footstep
9701,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,on the forest path.
9702,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9703,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"They were coyotes, horrible coyotes, that cast these shadows, and from"
9704,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,time to time gave a snarl of covetousness or impatience; but old Dick
9705,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"paid no attention to them. Ere long, however, he was obliged to devote"
9706,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,his entire attention to what was going on behind him. He had walked
9707,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"half the distance, and already saw through the forest arcades the"
9708,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,clearing which he must cross to reach the spot where he was expected.
9709,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,The angry barks of the wolves had increased during the last quarter of
9710,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"an hour, and the sound of their paws making the snow crackle inspired"
9711,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,the old man with an indescribable terror. The number of animals
9712,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,seemed momentarily to be augmented; it resembled an ant-heap seen
9713,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,through the magnifying-glass of a gigantic microscope.
9714,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9715,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Wolves, in all parts of the world, look twice before attacking a man;"
9716,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"they study the ground, and wait for the propitious moment. This was"
9717,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"what was now happening, very fortunately for old Dick, who was more"
9718,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"and more perceiving the greatness of the danger, and doubled his speed"
9719,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"in proportion as his pursuers grew more daring, brushed past his legs"
9720,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"with gnashing teeth, and joyously strove to get ahead of each other."
9721,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Dick was thoroughly acquainted with the habits of his enemies, and"
9722,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,hence carefully avoided running; that would have been giving the
9723,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"signal of attack, for coyotes only rush on persons who are frightened."
9724,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9725,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,The only chance of salvation left him was to prolong this dangerous
9726,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"walk to the skirt of the forest. There he hoped the coyotes, as they"
9727,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"do not dare venture into an open plain, would leave him and allow him"
9728,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,to continue his walk at peace. He also remembered that in the centre
9729,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"of the clearing there was a deserted cabin, and the thought of"
9730,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,reaching this refuge restored him a portion of his courage.
9731,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9732,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The daring of the coyotes increased with each moment, and the hapless"
9733,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,negro could not look around without seeing bright eyes moving in all
9734,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"directions, like the phosphorescent fireflies in summer. One after the"
9735,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"other the quadrupeds tried their teeth on old Dick's thin legs, and as"
9736,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,he had dropped his stick he had recourse to his fiddle to keep his
9737,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,foes aloof. At the first blow he dealt the springs produced a sound
9738,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"which had the immediate effect of putting to flight the coyotes, which"
9739,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,were surprised by this unusual music.
9740,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9741,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Dick, an observer naturally and by necessity, then began strumming his"
9742,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,fiddle with his fingers; and the carnivorous animals at once
9743,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"manifested fresh marks of surprise, as if a charge of shot had"
9744,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"tickled their ribs. This fortunate diversion, repeated several times,"
9745,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"brought Dick to the skirt of the forest, and taking advantage of a"
9746,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"favorable moment, he darted on, still striking the strings, and going"
9747,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,in the direction of the hut.
9748,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9749,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"The coyotes halted for a moment, with their tails between their legs,"
9750,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,looking at their prey flying before them; but ere long their ravenous
9751,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"instinct gained the upper hand, and with a unanimous bark they all"
9752,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,rushed in pursuit of the unfortunate negro. Had the wolves caught up
9753,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"to old Dick in this moment of fury, he might have appealed in vain to"
9754,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"his fiddle. By running he had destroyed the charm, and the coyotes"
9755,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,would not have stopped to listen to him even had he played like
9756,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Orpheus in the olden times, or Ole Bull in ours."
9757,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9758,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Fortunately, the old man reached the cabin at the moment when the"
9759,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,coyotes were at his heels. With a hand rendered doubly vigorous by the
9760,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"imminence of the danger, he shut the door of the protecting cabin, and"
9761,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"secured it with a beam he found within reach. Then he hoisted himself,"
9762,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"not without sundry lacerations of his garments, on the ruined roof,"
9763,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the beams of which alone remained, supported on blocks of wood at the"
9764,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,four corners of the walls.
9765,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9766,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,Old Dick found himself comparatively out of danger; but the coyotes
9767,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,displayed a fury which threatened to become terrible. Several of them
9768,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"had entered the cabin, and conjointly with those outside they leaped"
9769,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"at the legs of the minstrel, whom rapid movements and repeated kicks"
9770,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,scarce protected from numerous bites.
9771,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9772,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Old Dick, in spite of his agony, had not forgotten his fiddle, which"
9773,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"had saved his life in the forest. Seizing his bow with a firm hand, he"
9774,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"drew from the instrument a shrill note, which overpowered the"
9775,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"deafening barks of the coyotes, and silenced them as if by"
9776,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"enchantment. This silence henceforth continued, only interrupted by"
9777,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,the hysterical sounds which the fiddle produced under the
9778,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,fear-stiffened fingers of the old negro performer.
9779,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9780,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,This inharmonious music could not satisfy the starving animals for
9781,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"long, and from the efforts which they soon made to reach their prey,"
9782,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,old Dick comprehended that noise was not sufficient to enchant the
9783,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,wolves. They dashed forward more furiously than ever to escalade the
9784,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"wall. He considered himself lost, especially when he noticed, scarce"
9785,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"half a yard from his trembling legs, the enormous head of a coyote,"
9786,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"whose large, open eyes seemed to flash fire and gleam."
9787,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9788,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"""The Lord ha' mussy on all!"" he cried; ""I am an eaten man!"""
9789,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9790,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"And without knowing what he was about, he let his trembling fingers"
9791,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"stray over the fiddle, and began playing the famous air of ""Yankee"
9792,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Doodle."" It was the chant of the swan singing its requiem in the hour"
9793,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,of death.
9794,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9795,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"But suddenly--O, miracle of harmony!--a calm set in round the negro"
9796,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,minstrel. Orpheus was no fable: the animals obeyed this new
9797,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"enchantment; and when Dick, on recovering from his terror, was unable"
9798,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"to understand what was going on around him, he saw himself surrounded"
9799,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,by an audience a hundred fold more attentive to the charms of music
9800,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,than any which had hitherto admired his execution. This was so true
9801,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"that so soon as his bow ceased moving, the coyotes dashed forward to"
9802,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,renew the battle.
9803,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9804,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,Dick now knew what his means of preservation were. He must play the
9805,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"fiddle till some help arrived. Ere long, yielding to the fascination"
9806,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"of the art, the musician completely forgot the danger he incurred."
9807,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"Indulging all the fancies of his imagination, he gave his four-footed"
9808,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,audience a concert in which he surpassed himself. Never had he played
9809,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"with more taste, soul, and expression. Hence he forgot, in the"
9810,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"intoxication of his triumph, the wedding and the brilliant company,"
9811,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the whiskey-punch and supper smoking hot on the board, that awaited"
9812,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,him no great distance off.
9813,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9814,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"But alas! every medal has its reverse in this world, and all days of"
9815,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"pleasure have their to-morrow of woe. As the night advanced, the old"
9816,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,negro felt the cold pierce his stiffened limbs. In vain did he try to
9817,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"rest; if the bow left the fiddle strings, the coyotes rushed against"
9818,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"the walls of the cabin; if, on the contrary, he continued to wander"
9819,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"along the paths of harmony, these _dilettanti_ of a novel sort"
9820,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"squatted down on their hams, with their tails stretched out on the"
9821,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"snow, ears pricked up, tongues hanging from their half-opened jaws,"
9822,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"and they followed, with a regular movement of the head and body, all"
9823,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,the notes produced by old Dick's fiddle.
9824,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9825,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"While this fantastic scene, illumined by the moonbeams, was taking"
9826,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"place in the clearing, the negroes, who were awaiting their comrade to"
9827,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"begin the fun, were growing sadly impatient, and did not know what to"
9828,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"think of the delay of their musician, who was usually most punctual."
9829,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"At last six of them, tired of waiting, left the house to make a voyage"
9830,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"of discovery; and on reaching the cabin, on the top of which Dick was"
9831,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"perched, they noticed some thirty coyotes in the position I have"
9832,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,described. The old player was still continuing his involuntary
9833,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"concert, with his eyes fixed on his deadly foes."
9834,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,
9835,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"At the moment when the six negroes raised a simultaneous shout, the"
9836,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,whole band of coyotes thought it high time to bolt. In a twinkling
9837,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"they disappeared, and the fiddler, frozen and numbed, fell fainting"
9838,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"into the arms of his rescuers. His woolly hair, which, in spite of his"
9839,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"great age, was perfectly black at the time when he performed his"
9840,SAVED BY A FIDDLE.,"toilet, had turned white in the space of two hours."

9878,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""Well done, little one! A very pretty tune, and very nicely sung!"""
9879,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9880,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,The speaker was a stranger who had just come in sight of the pretty
9881,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"cottage where Robbie and Maria Barnes lived with their widowed mother,"
9882,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"and outside of which the little singer sat nursing the baby, while"
9883,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,Robbie chopped wood at a little distance.
9884,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9885,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"The widow, hearing a stranger's voice, came to the door, and seeing"
9886,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,that he appeared to have been walking far invited him to come in and
9887,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,take a rest. This he very gladly did; and while she dusted a chair for
9888,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"him, Mary brought a mug of fresh milk, and they were soon on very"
9889,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,friendly terms with him.
9890,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9891,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"He said that he was an artist, and that he had come to that part of"
9892,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,the country for a time to take sketches of the scenery around; that he
9893,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"was at present staying at the village inn, but that he would be very"
9894,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,glad if they could arrange to let him live with them for a few weeks.
9895,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"This was agreed upon, and on the next day Mr. Page--for that was the"
9896,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,stranger's name--took up his abode in the widow Paul's cottage.
9897,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9898,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,Very pleased Robbie and Maria were with him; and when he came home
9899,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,from his rambles and sat under the shade of the large tree by the side
9900,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"of the house finishing the sketches he had taken, they would stand"
9901,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"looking on with wondering interest. Robbie especially, who had never"
9902,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"seen any other pictures than those in his spelling-book, was rapt in"
9903,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"amazement as he saw hills, rivers, flowers, trees and animals start up"
9904,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"into seeming life under the artist's hand. Mr. Page, seeing how"
9905,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"interested the boy was in what he saw, invited him to accompany him in"
9906,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"his rambles. Robbie did so, and many valuable things he learned in"
9907,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,these pleasant wanderings.
9908,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9909,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"When the time came for Mr. Page to leave these simple cottagers, he"
9910,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,was as sorry to go as they were to part with him; and he promised that
9911,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"if he lived and prospered, he would endeavor to do something for his"
9912,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"favorite, Robbie."
9913,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9914,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,This visit of the artist to their humble abode became the
9915,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,turning-point in Robbie's life. An idea had taken possession of the
9916,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,boy's mind. Why should he not learn to be an artist like Mr. Page? He
9917,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,had watched very carefully the manner in which that gentleman
9918,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,proceeded when taking sketches of the objects around him; he had begun
9919,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,himself to look upon those objects with very different eyes from what
9920,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"he had been accustomed to, and felt sure that with patience and"
9921,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,perseverance he could master the art of drawing and painting himself.
9922,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9923,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,His first attempt was a rough sketch of grandma on his slate. It was
9924,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"done with a few strokes of the pencil, but there was really some"
9925,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"likeness to the dear old lady in it, and mother felt sure her boy"
9926,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,would some day be an artist.
9927,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9928,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,[Illustration: THE YOUNG ARTIST.]
9929,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9930,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"Several weeks passed away, and at length he thought he might attempt"
9931,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"the portrait of his little dog, ""Pink,"" and, if he could succeed to"
9932,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"his satisfaction, he determined that he would carry it home and"
9933,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,surprise his mother with it. After much patient labor he finished his
9934,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"task, and showed the sketch first of all to his friend Thomas, who"
9935,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"being much pleased with it, they hastened at once to Robbie's home"
9936,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"with it. Watching their opportunity, they stood the picture unobserved"
9937,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"against the wall, and waited to see the effect it would produce."
9938,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"Little Maria was the first to notice it. ""Oh, mother,"" she cried,"
9939,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""here's a picture of Pinky! Do come and look at it! Isn't it real?"""
9940,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9941,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,The widow turned from her work to look.
9942,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9943,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""Why, so it is,"" she exclaimed. ""Who painted it, Robbie? Where did you"
9944,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"get it from?"""
9945,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9946,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""Robbie did it himself,"" cried Thomas, unable to keep the secret any"
9947,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,longer.
9948,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9949,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""Robbie did it?"" echoed the widow, with a look of bewilderment. ""_You_"
9950,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"painted it, Robbie?"""
9951,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9952,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""Yes, mother,"" laughed Robbie, enjoying her perplexity; ""I did it all"
9953,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,myself. I have been learning unknown to you. If I can learn to paint
9954,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"as well as Mr. Page, mother, eh! Sha'n't I be able to help you then,"
9955,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"mother?"""
9956,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9957,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"She smiled and kissed him. His cleverness was pleasing to her, but his"
9958,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,loving ambition to be of service to her was still more grateful to her
9959,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,mother's heart.
9960,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9961,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,The famous Benjamin West said his mother's kiss made him a painter.
9962,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"Robbie Barnes might have said the same thing, for from that moment he"
9963,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"was more than ever determined to persevere. A few weeks after this,"
9964,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,Robbie and Thomas were out in the woods together. It was a holiday
9965,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"with them both, and Robbie had determined to spend the time in"
9966,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,sketching a certain landscape he had in view. They had brought their
9967,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"dinner with them; and while Robbie was drawing, Thomas laid out the"
9968,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"provisions. Having got it all ready, he went off to the brook to fetch"
9969,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"a mug of water, and as he returned called to Robbie to come to dinner."
9970,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"But what was his annoyance, as he came near, to see the mischievous"
9971,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,dog munching the last piece of cheese? In sudden passion he caught up
9972,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"a stick and gave chase to Pink, who scampered off with the cheese in"
9973,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,his mouth. Robbie was so amused at the comical scene that he thought
9974,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"he would attempt a painting of it, and this idea set Thomas laughing"
9975,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,as heartily as himself. It was weeks before he had finished the
9976,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"sketch; but when it was completed, it made a striking picture for a"
9977,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,boy of his age.
9978,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
9979,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"Years passed, and Robbie worked faithfully at his painting, and made"
9980,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,such progress that Mr. Moring urged him to go with him on a visit to
9981,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"the neighboring city, where he could see some gentlemen who might be"
9982,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,able to assist him in his desire of becoming a painter. Robbie was
9983,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"unwilling to leave his mother, but she was resolved he should not lose"
9984,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"the opportunity for her; and shortly afterward Robbie, with Thomas and"
9985,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"Mr. Moring, was on his way to the great city, which he had never seen"
9986,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"before. Arrived there, Mr. Moring took him to an exhibition of"
9987,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"pictures, and there introduced him again to his old friend Mr. Page."
9988,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"The artist, to whom Mr. Moring had already showed the painting of the"
9989,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"dog running off with the dinner, was exceedingly surprised that a boy"
9990,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"so entirely self-taught should have made such progress, and was"
9991,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,pleased indeed to see him again. His judgment of the merits of
9992,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,Robbie's work was such that Mr. Moring undertook to have the boy
9993,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"instructed by one of the best teachers of drawing, and so put him in a"
9994,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,fair way of attaining that upon which his heart was set--the becoming
9995,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"a painter like Mr. Page. Robbie's mother, though sad to part with him,"
9996,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,gratefully consented to his leaving his home for a time for this
9997,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,purpose; and though Robbie was much troubled to think what his mother
9998,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"would do without the little help he had been able to render her, he"
9999,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,was persuaded that the best way to serve her was to improve himself.
10000,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,He had not been long away before a message came to his mother telling
10001,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,her that he could earn enough by the sale of his little drawings to
10002,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"pay one of the village-lads to fetch wood and water, and to do other"
10003,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"little things for her; that he was improving very fast, and that he"
10004,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,had good reason to hope that he should one day be able to earn enough
10005,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,to keep them all in comfort.
10006,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
10007,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,Little Maria was busy braiding straw when this message came.
10008,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
10009,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""I shall not want Robbie to work for me, mother,"" she said. ""I shall"
10010,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"soon be able to earn my own living, and I will help to support our"
10011,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"dear mother when she grows old."""
10012,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,
10013,THE YOUNG ARTIST.,"""God bless you, my child!"" said the happy mother. ""With such dutiful"

10179,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Presence of mind is one of the rarest, as it is one of the most"
10180,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,enviable of endowments. It is the power of instantaneously forming a
10181,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"judgment, and acting upon it, and includes not only moral courage, but"
10182,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,self-possession. No matter how brave a man may be in the face of
10183,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"expected peril,--if he lacks presence of mind, he is helpless in a"
10184,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"sudden emergency. But, as this quality is an ingredient of the highest"
10185,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"courage, the bravest men invariably possess it. The presence of mind"
10186,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"of one man has often saved thousands of lives in sudden peril, on sea"
10187,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,or land. This is naturally enough regarded as a distinctively
10188,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,masculine virtue; but it is one that both sexes may profitably
10189,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"cultivate, as is shown by the following story. Girls as well as boys"
10190,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"should be taught self-reliance--to depend on themselves, to think"
10191,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,quickly and act promptly. Perhaps no emergency will arise in their
10192,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,lives in which the importance of such mental training shall be
10193,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"illustrated; but it is well to be prepared ""for any fate,"" and the"
10194,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,discipline which produces this virtue gives strength and symmetry to
10195,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,the whole intellectual organism.

10199,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Is supper nearly ready, Maggie? It is time for Jack to return from"
10200,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"his work."""
10201,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10202,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"The speaker was an elderly woman in a widow's garb, and the person she"
10203,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"addressed was her granddaughter, a pleasant-looking girl, who might"
10204,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,perhaps have been fourteen years of age.
10205,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10206,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Yes, grandmother, it is just ready, such as it is,"" replied Maggie;"
10207,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""but I could wish poor Jack had a better meal after his hard work"
10208,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"than what we are able to give him."""
10209,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10210,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Ay, ay, child, I wish it as much as you can; but what is to be done?"
10211,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Wishing will never make us rich folk, and we may be thankful if worse"

10213,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10214,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"So spoke the grandmother, and taking the spectacles from her nose, she"
10215,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,wiped their dim glasses with her apron.
10216,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10217,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Why, grandmother, what do you mean?"" cried Maggie, looking up in"
10218,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"alarm. ""What worse troubles can be coming, think you?"" And eagerly and"
10219,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,anxiously she fixed her bright blue eyes upon her grandmother's face.
10220,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10221,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Well,"" replied the old woman, ""the truth is just this, Maggie: I hear"
10222,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,that the new landlord is going to make some changes among his tenants;
10223,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"the cottages are all to be repaired, and the folks who can pay higher"
10224,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"rents will stay, while those who cannot must find lodging elsewhere."
10225,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"And how can we ever pay a higher rent, Maggie? Even now, every penny"
10226,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"of poor Jack's earnings is spent at the end of the week, and yet we"
10227,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"live as cheaply as ever we can."""
10228,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10229,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,For a moment or two the girl's face was as perturbed and downcast as
10230,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"that of her grandmother's, and she bent over her knitting in silence;"
10231,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,but by an evident effort she quickly assumed a more cheerful aspect.
10232,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"And advancing to the old lady's side, and placing a gentle hand on her"
10233,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"shoulder, she said,--"
10234,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10235,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""Don't fret, dear grandmother; God has cared for us so far, and he"
10236,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"will never suffer us to want, if we put our trust in him. That's what"
10237,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"father used to say, and what he said up to the very day of his death."""
10238,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10239,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"So saying, Maggie stooped and kissed the withered cheek of that"
10240,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"father's mother, thereby enforcing, as it were, her encouraging words."
10241,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10242,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""God bless you, my child!"" sobbed the old woman, returning the kiss."
10243,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"""You remind me of what I am too apt to forget. Yes, Maggie, your"
10244,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"father's God is our God, and he will never forsake his people. I will"
10245,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"wipe away these tears, and put faith in him for the future."" And the"
10246,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"grandmother dried her eyes, and rising from her low seat, said"
10247,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"cheerfully, ""Maggie, dear, go to the gate, and watch for your brother"
10248,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Jack. When you see him coming across the field, let me know, and I"
10249,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"will dish up the supper, so as to have it ready."""
10250,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10251,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Maggie put down her work, and passing through the low doorway of the"
10252,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"cottage, stood presently at the little gate that separated the tiny"
10253,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"garden from the meadow of a neighboring farmer, who turned his cattle"
10254,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,out there to graze.
10255,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10256,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Opening the gate, Maggie leaned against it, while with one hand she"
10257,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"shaded her eyes from the yet dazzling beams of the sinking sun, which"
10258,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"bathed with its parting radiance the western horizon, and crimsoned"
10259,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,the landscape around.
10260,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10261,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"A moment or two she thus stood, but Jack did not appear; and wondering"
10262,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"why he should be so late, Maggie was about to retrace her steps in"
10263,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"order to fetch her knitting, when, from that corner of the field which"
10264,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"by a stile communicated with the landlord's grounds, she saw a little"
10265,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"child emerge, dressed in a bright red frock and jacket, and running"
10266,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"heedlessly along, nearer and nearer to the cattle, which hitherto had"
10267,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,been grazing quietly in the centre of the field.
10268,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10269,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Now, however, as the little one approached, directing her steps so as"
10270,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"to pass them closely, they raised their heads, and a huge bull, the"
10271,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"king and guardian of the herd, attracted doubtless and enraged by the"
10272,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"color of the scarlet dress, bounded away from his companions, and with"
10273,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"his savage head bent, and his tail raised, gave chase to the child,"
10274,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"who, frightened at the bellowing of the angry beast, quickened her"
10275,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"pace, and fled screaming towards the cottage gate, at which Maggie was"
10276,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,standing. But the utmost speed of which the little one was capable was
10277,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"nothing to the long gallop of the bull, and in the first moment that"
10278,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Maggie witnessed the child's danger, her quick presence of mind and"
10279,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"tender heart resolved to do what many strong men, less self-forgetful,"
10280,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,would not have dared to attempt.
10281,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10282,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Tearing from her head a colored kerchief, which she had thrown over it"
10283,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"before she came out, she sprang through the gateway into the meadow,"
10284,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"and bounding lightly over the turf, in another minute she had placed"
10285,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,herself between the fierce animal and the child. On in his headlong
10286,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"fury came the gigantic brute, and was about to pass Maggie, seeing"
10287,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"only the scarlet frock just beyond, when the intrepid girl, springing"
10288,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"forward, dashed the kerchief across his eyes, and before he had time"
10289,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"to recover himself and recommence his pursuit, she had turned,"
10290,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"snatched up the little one, and was running towards the cottage gate."
10291,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Close behind the fugitives followed the bull, now recovered from his"
10292,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"momentary astonishment; but Maggie's feet were winged, for she felt"
10293,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,that through God's help she should save the child.
10294,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10295,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"A few more rapid steps, and the gate was reached and barred, while"
10296,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Maggie tottered into the house, still carrying the child, and in the"
10297,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"reaction of the fearful excitement, fell fainting on the floor."
10298,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10299,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Maggie's fainting fit, however, did not last long; and she was fully"
10300,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"restored, and had told her grandmother the whole story, before Jack"
10301,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"arrived, half an hour later."
10302,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10303,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"He, too, had something to recount. On his way home from the landlord's"
10304,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"grounds, where he had been working, he was overtaken by a young woman,"
10305,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,who seemed in a great state of alarm. She told Jack that she was the
10306,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"nursery maid, and that while that afternoon she was sitting at work"
10307,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"beneath one of the trees, with the children playing around her, one of"
10308,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"them--little Gertrude, a child about six years old--must have slipped"
10309,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"away from her brother and sisters unobserved; and when tea time came,"
10310,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"and the nurse rose to bring the children home, she was nowhere to be"
10311,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"found. The nurse had taken the other three little ones home, and had"
10312,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"now come in search of Gertrude, fearful lest she should fall into"
10313,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,danger of any kind.
10314,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10315,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Jack would not stop to eat his supper, after telling his own story and"
10316,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"hearing Maggie's, but announced his intention of at once carrying the"
10317,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,little truant lady back to her home.
10318,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10319,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"So the kind-hearted youth took Gertrude in his arms, and soon conveyed"
10320,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"her safely to the landlord's house, where she astonished every one by"
10321,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,the childish recital of her own danger and Maggie's courage.
10322,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10323,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,The next morning Gertrude's mother came down to the cottage to thank
10324,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Maggie for the preservation of her darling's life, and to bring a"
10325,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,message from her husband.
10326,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10327,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"This message consisted of his grateful acknowledgments, and of the"
10328,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,promise that Jack should be promoted to the office of assistant
10329,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,gardener as soon as that post was vacant (which would be in the course

10333,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,
10334,HOW MAGGIE PAID THE RENT.,"Thus was averted, by means wholly unforeseen, the trial of poverty and"

10460,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"This picture reminds me, children, of some funny stories that I have"
10461,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"heard your uncle John tell, when he and I were boy and girl together,"
10462,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"of his exploits as a schoolboy. According to his account, not only he,"
10463,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"but most of his schoolfellows, used to lead merry lives enough at"
10464,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"school. They had what they called the ""Academy Band,"" and grand music"
10465,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"it made, with a hat-box for a drum, cricket-bat for violoncello, and"
10466,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"paper flute and trumpets. You would not recognize Uncle John, whom you"
10467,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"know only as a man six feet high, in that little lad on the left side"
10468,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,of the picture with a battledore for a fiddle. They had a great deal
10469,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"of what he called excellent fun, though I am afraid it sometimes"
10470,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,bordered upon mischief or naughtiness. I used to consider that he and
10471,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,his schoolfellows were regular heroes as I listened to his stories
10472,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,when he came home for the holidays; and even now I must confess I
10473,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,cannot help laughing when I think of some of his naughty pranks.
10474,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10475,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Uncle John first went to a large school when he was eleven years old,"
10476,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,and I remember now the tremendous hamper of good things he took with
10477,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,him. The boys who slept in his bedroom were so pleased with the
10478,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,contents of his hamper that they determined to make a great feast. To
10479,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"add to their enjoyment, they imagined themselves to be settlers in the"
10480,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"backwoods of America or Australia. They built a log hut with bolsters,"
10481,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,and had a sort of picnic. One of them mounted on the top of the log
10482,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"hut to look out with his telescope for any approaching savages, while"
10483,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,the others enjoyed their suppers in and about the hut. When their fun
10484,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"was at its height, the door softly opened, and in walked Dr. Birchall,"
10485,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,spectacles on nose and cane in hand. What followed may be imagined.
10486,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10487,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"You know that Uncle John is an engineer now, and even as a little boy"
10488,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"he had a great turn for mechanical inventions. Well, he pondered over"
10489,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,some means by which such a sudden interruption to the enjoyment of
10490,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,his schoolfellows might be prevented in future; and I will tell you
10491,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,what he did.
10492,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10493,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,It happened that the large room in which he slept formed the upper
10494,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,floor of a wing of the house which had been added to it when it became
10495,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,a school; and there was no access to this room from the principal
10496,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,staircase of the house. You had to pass through the room below and go
10497,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,up a little separate staircase to reach to the floor above. The lower
10498,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"room was also a bedroom for the boys, and Uncle John's little scheme"
10499,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,was this:
10500,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10501,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,He made a hole with a gimlet in the frame of one of the windows of his
10502,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"bedroom, passed a piece of string through the hole, and carried it"
10503,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,outside the wall of the house down to a similar hole in a window-frame
10504,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,of the room below. To the end of the string in the upper room was
10505,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"fastened a small rattle, while the other end of the string--that in"
10506,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,the room below--was taken into the bed of a boy who slept near the
10507,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,window.
10508,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10509,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"This admirable little invention once in order, there was more rioting"
10510,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"in the upper room than ever; and the master, disturbed by the noise,"
10511,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"soon went, cane in hand, to stop it. The instant he set foot in the"
10512,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,lower room the boy there who held the string in bed gave it a little
10513,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"pull: the rattle sounded--ting! ting!--in the room above, and in an"
10514,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,instant every boy was in bed and snoring. Perhaps they had been
10515,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"playing at leap-frog the moment before, but as Dr. Birchall entered"
10516,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the room--and he crept up the staircase very quietly, that he might"
10517,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"catch them unawares--he found some twenty boys lying in bed, seemingly"
10518,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"sound asleep, though snoring unnaturally loud."
10519,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10520,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,The doctor was so disconcerted by this unexpected state of things that
10521,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"he retired at once, fancying perhaps that his ears had deceived him"
10522,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,when he thought he had heard a noise in the room. The same thing
10523,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"happened two or three times; the doctor was puzzled, and the"
10524,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,invention appeared a complete success; but at last all was
10525,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,discovered.
10526,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10527,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,[Illustration: THE ACADEMY BAND.]
10528,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10529,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The boys one evening began imprudently to play at ""tossing in the"
10530,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"blanket"" before they were undressed. The rattle sounded, and they had"
10531,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"just time to hide away the blanket. But the doctor coming in, and"
10532,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"finding they were only then beginning to undress, knew they must have"
10533,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"been at some mischief, and began questioning one after another."
10534,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Unluckily, while he was in the room the rattle sounded again by"
10535,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,accident; perhaps the boy in the room below had pulled the string by
10536,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"moving in bed. The doctor looked about, found the rattle hanging just"
10537,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"below the window, saw the string, opened the window and traced its"
10538,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"course outside, went down into the room below, and understood the"
10539,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,whole arrangement. Then he put the rattle in his pocket and went away
10540,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,without saying a word. The boys declared he had such difficulty in
10541,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,keeping himself from laughing that he was afraid to speak lest he
10542,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,should burst out.
10543,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10544,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"However, next day every boy in that room had a slight punishment, and"
10545,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,so the matter ended.
10546,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10547,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,Now I will tell you another of Uncle John's pranks at school. There
10548,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"was a large tree in the playground, the upper branches of which spread"
10549,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,out very near to the windows of the bedroom I have been describing.
10550,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,One evening Uncle John got hold of a large hand-bell which was used
10551,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"for ringing the boys up in the morning; and climbing up the tree, he"
10552,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,fastened it by a piece of string to a branch near the top. Then
10553,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,another boy threw him the end of a long string from a window of the
10554,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"bedroom into the tree, and he fastened it to the bell in such a way"
10555,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,that when it was pulled in the bedroom it made the bell ring in the
10556,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"tree. Having accomplished this arrangement, he came down from the tree"
10557,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,and went to bed.
10558,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10559,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,At ten o'clock at night the household was disturbed by the loud
10560,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"ringing of this bell. The master, in his dressing-gown, came out into"
10561,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the playground, and soon discovered where the sound came from, but of"
10562,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"course supposed that some boy had climbed up into the tree, and was"
10563,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"ringing the bell there. It was the middle of summer, and a beautiful"
10564,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"moonlight night, so the boys could see from the windows all that took"
10565,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"place. Dr. Birchall stood at the foot of the tree, looking up, and"
10566,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"exclaimed, angrily,"
10567,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10568,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Come down, you naughty boy! Come down, I say, directly! Oh, I'll give"
10569,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"you such a flogging! Stop that horrible noise, I tell you, and come"
10570,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"down!"""
10571,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10572,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,The bell still went on ringing. At last the string--being pulled too
10573,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"hard, I suppose, in the excitement of the fun--broke, and the bell"
10574,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"tumbled down from the top of the tree, falling very near the old"
10575,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,schoolmaster. This was worse than all.
10576,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10577,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""What!"" he exclaimed; ""you throw the bell at me? Why, if it had hit me"
10578,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"on the head, it might have killed me. Oh, you wicked boy! I'll expel"
10579,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"you, sir. I'll find out who you are if I stop here till morning."""
10580,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10581,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"At last, however, his patience was exhausted, and he went away, but"
10582,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,left an old butler to watch the tree all night. The boys from the
10583,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,windows could see this man settle himself comfortably on a seat which
10584,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"was at the foot of the tree. He lighted his pipe, and prepared to"
10585,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,carry out his master's orders and watch till daylight. By three
10586,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,o'clock in the morning the dawn broke; then the man began to look up
10587,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,occasionally into the tree. Now and then he walked a little distance
10588,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"away, first in one direction, and then in another, to look into parts"
10589,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,of the tree that he could not see from underneath. He kept this up
10590,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,till the sun had risen and it was broad daylight; then at last he
10591,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,became convinced that it was impossible there could be a boy in the
10592,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"tree. He walked slowly into the house, still smoking his pipe, with a"
10593,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,puzzled expression on his face.
10594,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,
10595,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,And I suspect he was not the only person who felt puzzled. The next
10596,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,"day the boys were going home for the holidays, so that no further"
10597,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,inquiry could be made. I wonder if Dr. Birchall ever found out how it
10598,UNCLE JOHN'S SCHOOL-DAYS.,had been managed?

10608,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"The dog has sometimes been called the ""friend of man."" This is"
10609,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"because, of all animals, it is the one whose attachment to mankind is"
10610,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"purely personal. It is found in almost every part of the world,"
10611,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,sharing every variation of climate and outward lot with the human
10612,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,race. There are only a few groups of islands in the Southern Pacific

10615,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,tilling the land was not known? or how could they have resisted the

10617,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10618,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Anecdotes of dogs, when they are well attested, are always welcome;"
10619,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,and I will therefore relate a few.
10620,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10621,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"There were some time ago two families, one living in London, the other"
10622,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"at Guildford, seventeen miles distant. These families were very"
10623,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"friendly with each other, and for several years it was the custom of"
10624,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,the one residing in London to pass the Christmas with the one at
10625,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,Guildford. It was the visitors' uniform practice to arrive to dinner
10626,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,the day before Christmas day; and they were accompanied by a large
10627,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"spaniel, which was a great favorite with both families."
10628,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10629,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,These visits were thus regularly paid for seven years. At the end of
10630,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,that time an unfortunate misunderstanding between the friends caused
10631,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,the usual Christmas invitation from the country to be omitted. About
10632,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"an hour before dinner, on the day before Christmas day, the Guildford"
10633,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"gentleman, who was standing at his window, exclaimed to his wife,--"
10634,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10635,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""Well, my dear, the ----s have thought better of it. I declare they"
10636,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"are coming as usual, though we did not invite them; here comes Cæsar"
10637,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"to announce them."""
10638,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10639,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Sure enough, the dog came trotting up to the door, and was admitted,"
10640,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"as he had often been before, to the parlor. The lady of the house gave"
10641,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,orders to prepare beds; dinner waited an hour; but no guests arrived.
10642,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10643,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Cæsar, after staying the exact number of days to which he had been"
10644,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"accustomed, one morning set off for home, and reached it in safety."
10645,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,The correspondence which this visit of the favorite spaniel
10646,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"occasioned, had the happy effect of renewing the intercourse of the"
10647,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"estranged friends. As long as Cæsar lived, he paid the annual visit,"
10648,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"in company with his master and mistress, to Guildford."
10649,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10650,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""A Frenchman named Chabert, who, from his wonderful performances with"
10651,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"fire, was known as the 'Fire King,' was the owner of a very beautiful"
10652,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Siberian dog, which, when yoked to a light carriage, used to draw him"
10653,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,twenty miles a day. Chabert sold him for nearly two hundred pounds;
10654,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,for the creature was as docile as he was beautiful. Between the sale
10655,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"and the delivery, the dog happened to get his leg broken. Chabert, to"
10656,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"whom the money was of great importance, was almost in despair,"
10657,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"expecting that the lamed animal would be returned, and the price"
10658,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"demanded back. He took the dog by night to a veterinary surgeon, and"
10659,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,formally introduced them to each other.
10660,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10661,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""'Doctor, my dog; my dog, your doctor.'"
10662,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10663,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""He next talked to the dog, pointed to his own leg, limped around the"
10664,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"room, and then requested the surgeon to apply bandages to his leg;"
10665,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,after which he walked about the room sound and well. Chabert then
10666,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"patted the dog on the head, who was looking by turns at him and the"
10667,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"surgeon; desired the surgeon to pat him, and to offer him his hand to"
10668,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"lick; and lastly, holding up his finger to the dog, and gently shaking"
10669,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"his head, quitted the room and the house. The dog immediately laid"
10670,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"himself down, submitted to have the fracture set, and to have a"
10671,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"bandage put on the limb, without a motion beyond once or twice licking"
10672,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"the operator's hand. He was afterwards submissive, and lay all but"
10673,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"motionless day after day, until, at the end of a month, the limb was"
10674,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"sound and whole once more. So perfect was the cure, that the purchaser"
10675,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"never knew the dog had sustained any injury."""
10676,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10677,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,I will finish my paper with a story of a dog that saved the life of a
10678,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,French soldier who was wounded in one of the terrible battles that
10679,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,have been lately fought in France:--
10680,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10681,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""The man had been struck by a ball in the chest, near the village of"
10682,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Ham, and lay on the ground for six hours after the fighting was over."
10683,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"He had not lost consciousness; but the blood was flowing freely, and"
10684,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,he was gradually getting weaker and weaker. There were none but the
10685,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"dead near him; and his only living companion was an English terrier,"
10686,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"which ran restlessly about him, with his master's _kepi_, or military"
10687,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"cap, in his mouth."
10688,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10689,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""At last the dog set off at a trot; and the wounded soldier made sure"
10690,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"that now his last friend had deserted him. The night grew dark, the"
10691,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"cold was intense, and he had not even the strength to touch his"
10692,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"wounds, which every instant grew more and more painful."
10693,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10694,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"[Illustration: {The terrier, carrying a kepi, tries to get help for"
10695,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,his master}]
10696,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10697,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"""At length his limbs grew cold, and, feeling a sickly faintness steal"
10698,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"upon him, he gave up all hope of life, and recommended himself to"
10699,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"the mercy of God. Suddenly he heard a bark, which he knew belonged to"
10700,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"only one little dog in the world, then felt something lick his face,"
10701,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,and saw the glare of lanterns. The dog had wandered for miles till he
10702,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"arrived at a road-side _cabaret_, or country wine-shop. The people had"
10703,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"heard the cannonading all day, and seeing the _kepi_ in the dog's"
10704,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"mouth, and noticing his restless movements, decided to follow him. He"
10705,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,took them straight to the spot--too straight for a little cart they
10706,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,had brought with them to cross fields and hedges--but just in time.
10707,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"When the friendly help arrived, the man fainted; but he was saved."
10708,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"There were honest tears in the man's eyes when he was telling me,"""
10709,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"says the narrator; ""and I fully believed him. The dog, too, had been"
10710,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"slightly touched in the leg by a ball in the same battle, and has"
10711,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"since been lame. He got him, when a puppy, from an English sailor at"
10712,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"Dunkirk, and called him 'Beel;' very probably the French for Bill."""
10713,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,
10714,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"This little terrier showed something more than instinct--some share,"
10715,FAITHFUL FRIENDS.,"at least, of common sense. At all events, he deserves to be"

10822,NINO.,"The rain was just beginning to fall in a thin, chilling drizzle, and"
10823,NINO.,"the cold air nipped sharply any unwary toe that showed itself, as Nino"
10824,NINO.,played a little air full of thoughts of birds and flowers. His thin
10825,NINO.,"jacket was no protection, and his dark eyes looked as if a shower"
10826,NINO.,"might drop from them; but the clouds had been over his life too long,"
10827,NINO.,and there were no tears left to fall. He was not so old that this must
10828,NINO.,"be the case; but he stood alone in the wide street, and no one spoke"
10829,NINO.,to or noticed him. One friend he had--his guitar; and now he put that
10830,NINO.,"under his jacket, lest the rain should hurt it."
10831,NINO.,
10832,NINO.,"""_Ah, carissima!_"" he murmured, as he hugged it under his arm; ""you"
10833,NINO.,"are never hungry or tired, and you shall not be wet. One of us shall"
10834,NINO.,"be happy."""
10835,NINO.,
10836,NINO.,"The guitar gave a little whisper as his jacket rubbed against it, and"
10837,NINO.,"Nino smiled and nodded in answer. Now the rain was falling rapidly,"
10838,NINO.,"and he stepped under an awning, to wait until it held up. There was a"
10839,NINO.,"lady standing there, her skirts held high, and her cloak drawn"
10840,NINO.,"closely, and Nino stood one side; for why should he be near any one?"
10841,NINO.,He well knew no one wanted him. He watched the water run by in the
10842,NINO.,"gutter, and looked into the barrel of apples at his side--large, rosy"
10843,NINO.,"apples, that would be so good; and he glanced up to see if any one saw"
10844,NINO.,"him. Why not take one? He could hide it, and eat it afterwards. The"
10845,NINO.,"grocer had so many; he had none, and it was days since he had eaten"
10846,NINO.,anything but dry bread. He knew it was not right to take what belonged
10847,NINO.,"to another; but he heard so little of right, and hunger and want"
10848,NINO.,pressed him every day.
10849,NINO.,
10850,NINO.,"As he stood thinking, not quite resolved to take one, there was a"
10851,NINO.,"patter of little feet, a merry laugh, and a bright vision stood by"
10852,NINO.,his side.
10853,NINO.,
10854,NINO.,Was she a fairy? She looked as he always felt his guitar would look if
10855,NINO.,"it could take a human form--slender, active, fair. A shower of golden"
10856,NINO.,"hair, not pale, but bright, like the summer sun; eyes as deep and blue"
10857,NINO.,as the distant sky; a face of which one would dream. Nino held his
10858,NINO.,"breath, and as the blue velvet coat brushed his ragged arm, drew a"
10859,NINO.,"sigh, and stepped back."
10860,NINO.,
10861,NINO.,"""Did I frighten you, little boy?"" asked the child. ""It was raining so"
10862,NINO.,"hard, and nursey had to run."""
10863,NINO.,
10864,NINO.,"""Come, stand in here, where it does not drip,"" cried the nurse,"
10865,NINO.,drawing her away.
10866,NINO.,
10867,NINO.,"Nino peeped under his coat, to be sure his guitar had not been"
10868,NINO.,"transformed, and then stepped aside under the eaves. It seemed as if"
10869,NINO.,he ought to be wet when such a lovely being was obliged to endure the
10870,NINO.,"discomfort of standing there. As she chattered, he drew near again,"
10871,NINO.,and wondered whether angels did not look like that. She was certainly
10872,NINO.,more beautiful than those in churches. He had forgotten that he was
10873,NINO.,"cold, and was feeling very happy, when the intentness of his gaze"
10874,NINO.,"attracted the child's attention. She was whispering to her nurse, when"
10875,NINO.,"a harsh voice cried out,--"
10876,NINO.,
10877,NINO.,"""Boy, go away from there! I can't watch those apples all the time."""
10878,NINO.,
10879,NINO.,"Nino had thoughtlessly laid his hand on the barrel, and when the"
10880,NINO.,"grocer spoke, moved hastily away."
10881,NINO.,
10882,NINO.,"""Here, little boy,"" cried the silvery tones of the child; ""don't go; I"
10883,NINO.,"want to give you an apple."" Then she said to the grocer, ""A big one,"
10884,NINO.,"please."""
10885,NINO.,
10886,NINO.,"""Yes, miss; I did not notice you were there; but those boys are so"
10887,NINO.,"bad!"""
10888,NINO.,
10889,NINO.,"Nino's face flushed, and his eyes glittered; but when the child"
10890,NINO.,"handed him the apple, he smiled, touched his hat, and said,--"
10891,NINO.,
10892,NINO.,"""Thankee, little lady."""
10893,NINO.,
10894,NINO.,"As he walked away, he did not notice the falling drops, but laid his"
10895,NINO.,"cheek against the apple, and smoothed its plump rosiness before he"
10896,NINO.,tasted its rich juiciness.
10897,NINO.,
10898,NINO.,Nino had no associates among the rough boys in the streets; he had a
10899,NINO.,pride that kept him above their coarse ways. As he played and sang the
10900,NINO.,"songs he learned in Italy, dim memories of a better life came to him,"
10901,NINO.,"and his music seemed a holy spirit. He would have died but for that,"
10902,NINO.,"his life was so cold, hard, and bare."
10903,NINO.,
10904,NINO.,"He had been brought over by a sea captain, who dealt in boys; and as"
10905,NINO.,"he was very ill on the voyage, the captain let an old woman take him"
10906,NINO.,"for a small sum. She thought his thin, sad face would move the"
10907,NINO.,"passers, and in pity they would give him money. For this reason she"
10908,NINO.,"sent him out day after day, in storm or shine, ill clad and weary,"
10909,NINO.,giving him but little food. But nature helped him. In spite of this
10910,NINO.,"treatment, he became stronger, and after a time ran away from her."
10911,NINO.,"Then he joined himself to a party of boy musicians, and by their help"
10912,NINO.,got his guitar. But they were unkind to him; for he was yet weak and
10913,NINO.,"timid, and the leader, a large boy, sometimes beat him if he refused"
10914,NINO.,"to play. One night Nino ran away from them, his precious guitar under"
10915,NINO.,"his arm; and since then he had played and sung through the streets,"
10916,NINO.,"sometimes begging, sometimes in despair, with thoughts of stealing."
10917,NINO.,
10918,NINO.,His chief delight and comfort was to lie in the sun on a fair day. He
10919,NINO.,"was always hungry, almost always cold, and when the wind did not blow,"
10920,NINO.,"and the sun was hot, he liked to bask on a step, and dream of good"
10921,NINO.,"dinners, pretty clothes, and a soft bed. The sun was the only thing he"
10922,NINO.,could find in the cold northern climate which was like his old home.
10923,NINO.,"In this way he would be nearly happy; but when storms came, he was"
10924,NINO.,chilled within and without. The world then was gray; he could not even
10925,NINO.,"play on his guitar, which in sunny days brought him pleasant pictures"
10926,NINO.,"of green fields, dancing water, and leafy vines, loaded with purple"
10927,NINO.,grapes.
10928,NINO.,
10929,NINO.,"His guitar was his only companion, and he treated it as if it was"
10930,NINO.,"alive; he talked to it, cared for and loved it with a tenderness which"
10931,NINO.,"was of no value to the instrument, but was of service to the"
10932,NINO.,"friendless boy, in giving him an unselfish motive."
10933,NINO.,
10934,NINO.,The autumn was fast advancing when he met the golden-haired child; and
10935,NINO.,"as the days became colder, he cherished the thought of her, and it"
10936,NINO.,"made him warm when the sky was cloudy, as if she was a ray of"
10937,NINO.,sunlight. He had generally slept on steps or any spot where the police
10938,NINO.,"would leave him unmolested; but now the nights were so chill, that he"
10939,NINO.,tried hard with a few cents to pay for a lodging.
10940,NINO.,
10941,NINO.,"With this purpose in his mind, he stopped before a house in a private"
10942,NINO.,street one evening just after dark. The gas was already lighted; but
10943,NINO.,"the curtains were not drawn, and Nino could see the table bountifully"
10944,NINO.,"spread, and a servant moving about, adding various articles to it. A"
10945,NINO.,"dancing figure passed and repassed the window, now peeping out, and"
10946,NINO.,again running back. Nino's voice trembled as he saw this light and
10947,NINO.,"warmth; and as he sang of ""love and knightly deeds,"" he thought of"
10948,NINO.,"himself out in the cold, with nothing to love but his guitar, and he"
10949,NINO.,felt very sad.
10950,NINO.,
10951,NINO.,"In a moment the door opened, and out sprang the child he had thought"
10952,NINO.,"of so long. The light seemed to follow her, and she cried,--"
10953,NINO.,
10954,NINO.,"""Here are some pennies."" Nino removed his ragged hat, and held it out,"
10955,NINO.,"and she said, ""O, you're the same little boy! Wait a minute, and I'll"
10956,NINO.,"get you a cake."""
10957,NINO.,
10958,NINO.,[Illustration: NINO.]
10959,NINO.,
10960,NINO.,Nino stood with his hat off until she returned and gave him a cake.
10961,NINO.,
10962,NINO.,"""You play such pretty tunes! and I know you now; for I've seen you"
10963,NINO.,"twice,"" she said, folding her hands, and looking at him."
10964,NINO.,
10965,NINO.,"Nino murmured,--"
10966,NINO.,
10967,NINO.,"""Thankee, pretty lady,"" and looked at her as if she was a being from"
10968,NINO.,another world.
10969,NINO.,
10970,NINO.,"""What is your name?"" she asked."
10971,NINO.,
10972,NINO.,"""Nino."""
10973,NINO.,
10974,NINO.,"""Come, darling; don't stand out there,"" called her mother from the"
10975,NINO.,house.
10976,NINO.,
10977,NINO.,"""My name's Viola. Good by,"" she cried, as she ran in."
10978,NINO.,
10979,NINO.,"Nino sang one more song, and then kissing his hand to the little form"
10980,NINO.,"at the window, went on his way happy. The money brought him a night's"
10981,NINO.,lodging and permission to leave his guitar. In the morning--for the
10982,NINO.,"following day was Sunday, and if he carried it with him, the police"
10983,NINO.,might arrest him for trying to play--he made a light breakfast on a
10984,NINO.,"roll, and went to the street where Viola lived, to see if he could"
10985,NINO.,"meet her. As the bells were ringing, she came down the steps with her"
10986,NINO.,"parents, and Nino followed at a respectful distance, until they went"
10987,NINO.,into church. Nino attempted to go in also; but the sombre sexton at
10988,NINO.,"the door frightened him with a severe look, and he wandered on. After"
10989,NINO.,"a time he came to a mission church, where, by a sign, all were invited"
10990,NINO.,"to enter. Taking a back seat, and trying to understand the preacher,"
10991,NINO.,"he fell asleep. When he awoke, the preacher was gone; but the room was"
10992,NINO.,"full of ragged children, and for the first time Nino found himself in"
10993,NINO.,a Sunday school.
10994,NINO.,
10995,NINO.,"The teacher nearest to him was a sweet-faced lady, who spoke gently to"
10996,NINO.,"the boys of being kind to others, and patient with those who had not"
10997,NINO.,"the chance to learn that they had; she told them stories, to show them"
10998,NINO.,"how kindness would return to them, and how happy it made them to have"
10999,NINO.,"others gentle with them. Nino listened, and thought of Viola; and when"
11000,NINO.,"all sang some hymns while a lady played the piano, a new life stirred"
11001,NINO.,in him.
11002,NINO.,
11003,NINO.,"When the services were over, the teacher gave him a paper, and asked"
11004,NINO.,"him to come again. He sat on the steps after all were gone, looking at"
11005,NINO.,"the pictures, and when he returned to his lodging went around by"
11006,NINO.,"Viola's house, and was rewarded by seeing her sitting in the window"
11007,NINO.,with a book. When he reached the wretched place where he had spent the
11008,NINO.,"night, and looked for his guitar, he could not find it. Asking the"
11009,NINO.,"woman about it, she said she was cleaning up, and it was somewhere on"
11010,NINO.,"the floor. Nino's heart began to swell, and when he found it in one"
11011,NINO.,"corner, snapped and broken, his grief and anger burst forth in a"
11012,NINO.,"volley of Italian. He hugged it, and sobbed over it, called the woman"
11013,NINO.,"a beast, and pointed to the ruin of his favorite in angry despair."
11014,NINO.,
11015,NINO.,In the midst of this tumult of feeling the paper he had received
11016,NINO.,"dropped out of his bosom, and striking his feet, recalled the"
11017,NINO.,"teacher's words and Viola sitting quietly by the window. Nino stopped,"
11018,NINO.,"and for a moment was silent, then saying, ""You didn't mean to,"" picked"
11019,NINO.,"up the paper, folded his jacket over the guitar, and left the house."
11020,NINO.,His anger had vanished; but his grief remained. He spent the evening
11021,NINO.,"in tears and wretchedness, alternately gazing at his guitar, stroking"
11022,NINO.,"it, and then giving way to passionate crying. At last he slept, curled"
11023,NINO.,"up in one corner, and in the morning awoke with a cough which hurt his"
11024,NINO.,side.
11025,NINO.,
11026,NINO.,Now he had only his singing to depend on; he had not been taught any
11027,NINO.,"useful employment, and did not know how to work. He wandered about in"
11028,NINO.,"the most disconsolate manner, his cough getting worse, and his grief"
11029,NINO.,"for his guitar, which he always carried with him, still tormenting"
11030,NINO.,"him. Sometimes, when people saw the poor boy crouching in a corner,"
11031,NINO.,"hugging a broken guitar, and crying bitterly, they would give him a"
11032,NINO.,"few cents. He would not beg; something held him back, and the thought"
11033,NINO.,of Viola would not let him steal.
11034,NINO.,
11035,NINO.,"On the Saturday after he had been to Sunday school, as he was sitting"
11036,NINO.,"on a step, sadly thinking, he saw Viola and her nurse crossing the"
11037,NINO.,street towards him. At that moment a carriage with wildly running
11038,NINO.,horses turned the corner. Men on the sidewalk shouted and waved their
11039,NINO.,"arms. Viola, confused by their cries, turned back, and the horses,"
11040,NINO.,"startled, dashed in the same direction. Nino threw aside his guitar,"
11041,NINO.,"and sprang forward, drew Viola out of danger, but fell himself, and"
11042,NINO.,"the carriage passed over his foot, crushing it, while in falling he"
11043,NINO.,"hit his head against the pavement, and lay insensible. Some of the men"
11044,NINO.,"ran after the horses, some helped the nurse carry Viola home,--for she"
11045,NINO.,"was crying and trembling with fright,--and a policeman took Nino away."
11046,NINO.,
11047,NINO.,"When Viola was restored, she began to ask for Nino."
11048,NINO.,
11049,NINO.,"""It was Nino, mamma, and I want to see him,"" was her constant cry."
11050,NINO.,
11051,NINO.,Her father and mother were also anxious to reward the brave boy who
11052,NINO.,"had saved their only child, and made many inquiries to find him. The"
11053,NINO.,"policeman had taken him to the station-house, and there no one"
11054,NINO.,remembered anything about him.
11055,NINO.,
11056,NINO.,"""There are so many of those children brought in, madam, you have no"
11057,NINO.,"idea. We don't pretend to keep track of them all,"" was the only"
11058,NINO.,information they could get.
11059,NINO.,
11060,NINO.,At last they were obliged to give up their search; but Viola was much
11061,NINO.,dissatisfied.
11062,NINO.,
11063,NINO.,About a week after the accident Viola's mother was invited by a lady
11064,NINO.,"friend to visit one of the city hospitals. She took Viola with her,"
11065,NINO.,"and as they walked by the white beds, the child held her mother's hand"
11066,NINO.,"tightly, and felt quite subdued at the pale, sick faces about her. But"
11067,NINO.,"suddenly she bounded away, and climbing on a little bed, cried,--"
11068,NINO.,
11069,NINO.,"""O, I've found him! here he is--my dear Nino."""
11070,NINO.,
11071,NINO.,"Nino--for it was he--shrank back into his pillows, and covering his"
11072,NINO.,"face with his hands, cried aloud. From the station-house he had been"
11073,NINO.,"taken to the hospital, where his foot had to be amputated, and he had"
11074,NINO.,"lain for several days, with a bandaged head, in great pain. His guitar"
11075,NINO.,"was lost, and he had been so lonely, though the nurses were kind, that"
11076,NINO.,at the sight of Viola his fortitude gave way.
11077,NINO.,
11078,NINO.,"""Don't cry, and don't be frightened,"" said Viola, kissing him, and"
11079,NINO.,"taking her handkerchief to wipe his tears. ""I love you, dear Nino, and"
11080,NINO.,"now I've found you."""
11081,NINO.,
11082,NINO.,"""Is this your Nino, Viola?"" asked her mother, while the nurses and"
11083,NINO.,other patients looked on with surprise.
11084,NINO.,
11085,NINO.,"""Yes, mamma; is he not pretty?"" and she tried to remove his hands."
11086,NINO.,
11087,NINO.,"When he was a little more composed, Viola's mother thanked and praised"
11088,NINO.,"him for saving her daughter's life, and persuaded him to tell her what"
11089,NINO.,"he knew about himself. And the nurses told how patient he had been,"
11090,NINO.,"and she gave him some fruit, and promised to come again. When Viola"
11091,NINO.,"bade him good by, she put her arms about his neck and kissed him, and"
11092,NINO.,they left him quite happy.
11093,NINO.,
11094,NINO.,"A few days after they came again, and Viola cried when she saw him."
11095,NINO.,
11096,NINO.,"""You are going to come and live with us, and be my brother."""
11097,NINO.,
11098,NINO.,"""If you would like to,"" said her mother; and Nino's eyes sparkled with"
11099,NINO.,joy at the thought.
11100,NINO.,
11101,NINO.,"Then he was carefully laid in the carriage, and taken to his beautiful"
11102,NINO.,"new home. More than he had ever dreamed, or fancied, came to"
11103,NINO.,"him--books, pictures, toys, kind care, love, and a fine new guitar,"
11104,NINO.,with the promise of learning to play it better. An artificial foot was
11105,NINO.,"to help him walk, and the wonders and delights of his home ever"
11106,NINO.,multiplied.
11107,NINO.,
11108,NINO.,Best of all was his sister Viola. He almost worshipped her; and it was
11109,NINO.,a long time before he could bring himself to treat her with any
11110,NINO.,"familiarity. When she caressed him, which was often,--for she loved"
11111,NINO.,"him dearly, and he was a lovable boy,--he always kissed her hands. One"
11112,NINO.,"day she shook her head at this, and said,--"
11113,NINO.,
11114,NINO.,"""Nino, that is not the way; kiss me good;"" and she turned her face,"
11115,NINO.,"with its rosy mouth, towards him."
11116,NINO.,
11117,NINO.,"With reverence, as if he was saluting a queen, Nino leaned towards"
11118,NINO.,"her, and then with a sudden impulse, caught her in his arms, and"
11119,NINO.,"kissed her heartily. That was the seal of their affection, and from"
11120,NINO.,"that time Nino assumed all a brother's pride, care, and tenderness."
11121,NINO.,"After he had recovered, they were constantly together, and their"
11122,NINO.,mother was never so content as when Nino had the charge of Viola. He
11123,NINO.,"never spared himself to serve her, and she was ever an impulse to"
11124,NINO.,"goodness and truth, shining before him like a star, as she had from"
11125,NINO.,the first time he saw her. And she clung to him with the same love she
11126,NINO.,"had first felt, proud of her brother, who developed a noble character;"
11127,NINO.,and they all learned to thank the accident which had brought them so
11128,NINO.,happily together.

11168,SALLY SUNBEAM.,SALLY SUNBEAM.
11169,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11170,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11171,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"This is not her real name. Her real name is Sally Brown. Why, then,"
11172,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"have I called her Sally Sunbeam? Why, because everybody else calls her"
11173,SALLY SUNBEAM.,so.
11174,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11175,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"The reason is this: she is such a pleasant, happy, kind,"
11176,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"sweet-tempered child that wherever she comes she comes like a sunbeam,"
11177,SALLY SUNBEAM.,gladdening and brightening all around her. It was her uncle Tom who
11178,SALLY SUNBEAM.,first gave her her new name. He was spending a few days with the
11179,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"family for the first time for some years, for he lived a long way off"
11180,SALLY SUNBEAM.,and had not seen Sally since she was a baby. Sally became very fond of
11181,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"him at once, and so did he of Sally. As soon as he came down of a"
11182,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"morning, there was Sally with her merry, laughing eyes to greet him."
11183,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Whatever he wanted done, there was Sally with her ready willingness to"
11184,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"do it for him. Wherever he went, there was Sally with her merry chat"
11185,SALLY SUNBEAM.,and her pleased and happy face to keep him company.
11186,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11187,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"And when the evening came, and Sally, with an affectionate kiss, had"
11188,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"bidden him good-night and gone away to bed, he felt as though a cloud"
11189,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"had cast its shadow over the house. So one morning, when Uncle Tom was"
11190,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"going out for a walk and wanted Sally to go with him, he said, ""Where"
11191,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"is my little sunbeam? Sally Sunbeam, where are you? Oh, here you are!"""
11192,SALLY SUNBEAM.,laughing as she came skipping in from the garden.
11193,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11194,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""But my name is not Sally Sunbeam, uncle,"" she said. ""My name is Sally"
11195,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Brown."""
11196,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11197,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Her mamma smiled. ""It is only your uncle's fun,"" she said."
11198,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11199,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Well, it is only my fun,"" said Uncle Tom. ""But it's a very proper"
11200,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"name for her, for all that. She is more like a sunbeam than anything"
11201,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"else. So come along, Sally Sunbeam. Let us go and have a nice walk."""
11202,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11203,SALLY SUNBEAM.,And from that time Uncle Tom never called her by any other name. And
11204,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"other people came to call her by it too, and everybody felt that it"
11205,SALLY SUNBEAM.,was as true and fitting a name for her as ever a child could have.
11206,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11207,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Here she is in our picture, hanging up her doll's clothes, that she"
11208,SALLY SUNBEAM.,has just washed. How bright and happy she looks! Uncle Tom may well
11209,SALLY SUNBEAM.,call her Sally Sunbeam. But it is not only her cheerfulness and
11210,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"playfulness that makes her worthy of her name. This, of itself, would"
11211,SALLY SUNBEAM.,not be sufficient to make her loved as she is loved. Oh no! It is the
11212,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"kindness of her heart, the gentleness of her disposition, the delight"
11213,SALLY SUNBEAM.,she takes in trying to make everybody happy. This is what makes
11214,SALLY SUNBEAM.,everybody love her.
11215,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11216,SALLY SUNBEAM.,Only the other day a group of several children passed the garden gate
11217,SALLY SUNBEAM.,on their way from school. There was one poor little thing amongst them
11218,SALLY SUNBEAM.,whose dress was so shabby and whose shoes were so bad as to make it
11219,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"evident that her parents must be very, very poor."
11220,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11221,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Sad to say, her schoolfellows were jeering her and teasing her about"
11222,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"her appearance. One of these especially was taunting her very cruelly,"
11223,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"and the poor child was crying. Sally ran out to her, and putting her"
11224,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"arm lovingly round her said,"
11225,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11226,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""What is the matter, dear? What do you cry for?"""
11227,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11228,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Because they keep on laughing at me so,"" sobbed the child."
11229,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11230,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Well, who can help laughing at her?"" cried the girl who had been"
11231,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"teasing her the most. ""Look at her shoes! Do you call those shoes?"""
11232,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11233,SALLY SUNBEAM.,And at this the children all burst out laughing afresh.
11234,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11235,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,"" said Sally, ""to laugh at the"
11236,SALLY SUNBEAM.,poor child and make her cry. It is very cruel of you. Suppose _you_
11237,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"could not get good shoes, how would _you_ like to be laughed at?"""
11238,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11239,SALLY SUNBEAM.,And there was something so serious and pitying in her tone that the
11240,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"children _were_ ashamed of themselves, and went off without saying"
11241,SALLY SUNBEAM.,another word.
11242,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11243,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Never mind what they say,"" said Sally to the child. ""Come into my"
11244,SALLY SUNBEAM.,garden till they have gone right away. There! sit down on that seat
11245,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"for a minute,"" she said, leading her to one. ""I will be back again"
11246,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"directly."""
11247,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11248,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"And she ran to her mamma, and in a great hurry told her all about it,"
11249,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"and when the story was finished said, ""I've got a boxful of money,"
11250,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"mamma, that I have saved to buy toys with. May I buy the little girl a"
11251,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"pair of new boots with it?"""
11252,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11253,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""I must go and speak to her first,"" said her mamma."
11254,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11255,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"So Sally's mamma came to the child and asked her a few questions, and"
11256,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"found that the little thing had no father, and that her mother was"
11257,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"ill, and that she had several brothers and sisters, and the good lady"
11258,SALLY SUNBEAM.,judged from all this how poor they must be.
11259,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11260,SALLY SUNBEAM.,Having satisfied herself that the child's mother was not likely to be
11261,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"offended by the gift of a pair of boots to her little one, she said,"
11262,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""My little daughter here would like to buy you a new pair of boots."
11263,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"Would you like to have a pair?"""
11264,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11265,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Buy _me_ a new pair of boots!"" said the child, with a look of"
11266,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"astonishment. ""Oh, but they'll cost a lot of money. Mother has been"
11267,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"going to buy me some for ever so long, only she hasn't been able to"
11268,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"get money enough."""
11269,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11270,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""But I've got ever so much money that I was going to buy toys with,"""
11271,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"said Sally, ""only I would rather buy you a pair of boots if you would"
11272,SALLY SUNBEAM.,let me. And then those naughty girls won't be able to tease you about
11273,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"your shoes any more, you know. So come along, and we'll buy them at"
11274,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"once. May we, mamma?"""
11275,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11276,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"""Yes, if you like."" And away they all went together to the"
11277,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"bootmaker's, and the money that Sally had thought to buy herself all"
11278,SALLY SUNBEAM.,sorts of toys with was expended upon a nice warm pair of boots for the
11279,SALLY SUNBEAM.,stranger-child.
11280,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11281,SALLY SUNBEAM.,Don't you think that Sally must have seemed like a sunbeam to that
11282,SALLY SUNBEAM.,poor little one?
11283,SALLY SUNBEAM.,
11284,SALLY SUNBEAM.,But this is only one of the instances of her kindness and sympathy and
11285,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"goodness of heart. She has learned of Him who all his life ""went about"
11286,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"doing good,"" and every day tries to follow his blessed example. She"
11287,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"has her faults, of course, like the rest of us, and these she has to"
11288,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"fight against. But it is her virtues, not her faults, that she is"
11289,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"known by--her brightness, her good temper, her sweetness of"
11290,SALLY SUNBEAM.,"disposition, her kindness, her unselfishness; and this is how it is"
11291,SALLY SUNBEAM.,that everybody agrees to call her Sally Sunbeam instead of Sally
11292,SALLY SUNBEAM.,Brown.
11293,SALLY SUNBEAM.,

11299,AUNT THANKFUL.,AUNT THANKFUL.
11300,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11301,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11302,AUNT THANKFUL.,"She was our school teacher, a little bit of a woman, hardly larger"
11303,AUNT THANKFUL.,than a good-sized doll. She had moved into our village years before I
11304,AUNT THANKFUL.,"was born; for so I heard the folks say, I don't know how many times."
11305,AUNT THANKFUL.,Nobody seemed to know where she came from. She had no relatives--at
11306,AUNT THANKFUL.,"least, none called to see her or to visit her. Once or twice, as I"
11307,AUNT THANKFUL.,"grew older, I heard dark hints whispered about Aunt Thankful, about"
11308,AUNT THANKFUL.,"her having left her early home to get away from unpleasant memories,"
11309,AUNT THANKFUL.,"but no whisper against her character. She was a good woman, a"
11310,AUNT THANKFUL.,Christian woman--only the people called her _odd_.
11311,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11312,AUNT THANKFUL.,"But everybody loved her. In sickness or health, in trouble or joy, in"
11313,AUNT THANKFUL.,"prosperity or adversity, everybody was sure they could depend upon"
11314,AUNT THANKFUL.,"assistance and sympathy, if needed, from Aunt Thankful. She was always"
11315,AUNT THANKFUL.,"ready to extend her helping hand, always ready to do a generous act."
11316,AUNT THANKFUL.,She was ever true to herself as well as to her neighbors. Perhaps that
11317,AUNT THANKFUL.,"was the reason why the world called her _odd_. If so, how earnestly I"
11318,AUNT THANKFUL.,wish there were a great many more odd folks!
11319,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11320,AUNT THANKFUL.,Aunt Thankful lived many years in the village before she began to keep
11321,AUNT THANKFUL.,school. I remember how funny she used to look as she came down the
11322,AUNT THANKFUL.,street towards the school-house. She was so small that I should not
11323,AUNT THANKFUL.,have been astonished to see her driving a hoop to school.
11324,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11325,AUNT THANKFUL.,Then she wore her spectacles in such a funny way! What use they were
11326,AUNT THANKFUL.,"to her, I never could discover. If she looked at the scholars in the"
11327,AUNT THANKFUL.,"school-house, she looked _over_ the glasses; if she was reading or"
11328,AUNT THANKFUL.,"writing, she looked _under_ them. I have often heard boys, who were"
11329,AUNT THANKFUL.,"considered truthful, declare that on no occasion was she ever known to"
11330,AUNT THANKFUL.,look _through_ them.
11331,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11332,AUNT THANKFUL.,But what made Aunt Thankful so popular with the children was her kind
11333,AUNT THANKFUL.,manner and her kinder words. Somehow or other she used to like the
11334,AUNT THANKFUL.,poor and the friendless children the best. That was quite a puzzle to
11335,AUNT THANKFUL.,"me at first. We usually pay most attention to such as are well off,"
11336,AUNT THANKFUL.,"and prosperous, and dressed nicely. But not so was it with Aunt"
11337,AUNT THANKFUL.,Thankful. She took sides always with the weak and the down-trodden. I
11338,AUNT THANKFUL.,"have seen her mend many an apron, many a torn dress worn by a poor"
11339,AUNT THANKFUL.,"scholar, during school hours. She did it, too, in such a kind way,"
11340,AUNT THANKFUL.,that it made one forget that they were poor. That was because she was
11341,AUNT THANKFUL.,"ODD, you know."
11342,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11343,AUNT THANKFUL.,"As I grew up, I began to understand more of this good lady's character"
11344,AUNT THANKFUL.,than I ever dreamed when I went to school. I saw things in a different
11345,AUNT THANKFUL.,"light, as it were. And for her many good acts, from the fact that she"
11346,AUNT THANKFUL.,"was about my first school teacher, I do not think I shall ever forget"
11347,AUNT THANKFUL.,her.
11348,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11349,AUNT THANKFUL.,There is another reason why I shall never forget Aunt Thankful.
11350,AUNT THANKFUL.,Perhaps I had better tell you about it. She kept our village school
11351,AUNT THANKFUL.,one summer; I think it must have been the second or third year I went
11352,AUNT THANKFUL.,"to school. Anyhow, I was in one of the lower classes."
11353,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11354,AUNT THANKFUL.,"The school-house was a little box of a thing, hardly bigger than a"
11355,AUNT THANKFUL.,decent-sized shed. There was only one room in the building. The
11356,AUNT THANKFUL.,"teacher sat upon a small platform on one side, while the seats for the"
11357,AUNT THANKFUL.,"scholars were raised, one above the other, on the opposite side. Over"
11358,AUNT THANKFUL.,"the teacher's desk was a little square window, looking out upon the"
11359,AUNT THANKFUL.,horse shed in the rear.
11360,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11361,AUNT THANKFUL.,"It was a hot summer forenoon, and the windows were all open; the"
11362,AUNT THANKFUL.,morning lessons had been completed. Aunt Thankful sat writing at her
11363,AUNT THANKFUL.,"desk, now and then casting her eyes round the school-room, to see"
11364,AUNT THANKFUL.,that everything was in order. But there was mischief brewing. The
11365,AUNT THANKFUL.,"children were waiting impatiently for noon recess, and more than one"
11366,AUNT THANKFUL.,of them were having a quiet whisper or giggle all by themselves.
11367,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11368,AUNT THANKFUL.,All at once some of the children saw the mischievous face of a monkey
11369,AUNT THANKFUL.,peeping in at the little back window behind the teacher's desk. Of
11370,AUNT THANKFUL.,"course those who saw such an unusual sight laughed outright, greatly"
11371,AUNT THANKFUL.,to the astonishment of Aunt Thankful.
11372,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11373,AUNT THANKFUL.,"Rap! rap! rap! went her ruler upon the desk, as a signal for quiet. At"
11374,AUNT THANKFUL.,"the noise the monkey dodged out of sight in a moment, and soon the"
11375,AUNT THANKFUL.,children were restored to order. Aunt Thankful went on writing.
11376,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11377,AUNT THANKFUL.,"To explain so unusual a sight, I ought to say that a strolling organ"
11378,AUNT THANKFUL.,"man, with a monkey, had been in the village that day. He had stopped"
11379,AUNT THANKFUL.,"in the shed behind the school-house to eat his dinner. Accidentally,"
11380,AUNT THANKFUL.,"he had fallen asleep; and his monkey, being of an inquisitive turn,"
11381,AUNT THANKFUL.,"had got loose, and was exploring on his own account. He carried a part"
11382,AUNT THANKFUL.,"of his chain upon his neck all the while, and somehow or other he had"
11383,AUNT THANKFUL.,"climbed up to the little square window, as related."
11384,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11385,AUNT THANKFUL.,Aunt Thankful went on writing. But soon the monkey appeared again over
11386,AUNT THANKFUL.,"her head, turning his funny little face to one side and the other,"
11387,AUNT THANKFUL.,"showing his teeth, grinning, and going through other performances."
11388,AUNT THANKFUL.,"This time the laughing was louder than before, because more children"
11389,AUNT THANKFUL.,saw the show. I must record here that a funnier sight I never have
11390,AUNT THANKFUL.,witnessed.
11391,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11392,AUNT THANKFUL.,"The teacher looked up once more, and rapped on her desk quite"
11393,AUNT THANKFUL.,"indignantly. ""James Collins,"" she said, with severe authority, ""come"
11394,AUNT THANKFUL.,"here, this moment. If you cannot sit in your seat without laughing,"
11395,AUNT THANKFUL.,"come and stand by me. You, too, Walter, and Solomon. And you, Martha"
11396,AUNT THANKFUL.,"Hapgood. I am astonished at your conduct."""
11397,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11398,AUNT THANKFUL.,"The recusant children ranged themselves before the teacher, who seemed"
11399,AUNT THANKFUL.,to think she had now quenched the rebellion. I noticed that they
11400,AUNT THANKFUL.,"managed to stand so they could have a good view of the window, as if"
11401,AUNT THANKFUL.,"they expected, or even hoped for, another occasion for laughing."
11402,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11403,AUNT THANKFUL.,"And they didn't wait long, either. In a minute or two the monkey"
11404,AUNT THANKFUL.,appeared for the third time; and on this occasion he came wholly into
11405,AUNT THANKFUL.,"sight, chain and all, and began to dance up and down in his peculiar"
11406,AUNT THANKFUL.,"way, bowing and nodding to the spectators. By this time all the"
11407,AUNT THANKFUL.,"children had found out--by the usual school telegraph, I suppose--what"
11408,AUNT THANKFUL.,"was going on, and joined in a loud and universal laugh."
11409,AUNT THANKFUL.,
11410,AUNT THANKFUL.,"""Sakes alive!"" exclaimed Aunt Thankful, jumping up and seizing her"
11411,AUNT THANKFUL.,"ruler; ""what's got into the children?"" Whether the monkey thought the"
11412,AUNT THANKFUL.,flourish which the teacher's ruler took was a signal for a fight or
11413,AUNT THANKFUL.,"not, I never knew; but certain it is he began to scream and shake his"
11414,AUNT THANKFUL.,chain. The children laughed louder than ever. Aunt Thankful turned
11415,AUNT THANKFUL.,"round, saw what the trouble was, and raised her hands. The monkey"
11416,AUNT THANKFUL.,"construed this as an act of war, and with a single jump landed on the"
11417,AUNT THANKFUL.,desk. Here for a few moments he made the papers fly pretty nimbly. He
11418,AUNT THANKFUL.,"upset the inkstand, scattered the sandbox and pens, screaming all the"

11773,LAME SUSIE.,"she commences to walk, and then you can see that one of the fat little"
11774,LAME SUSIE.,"legs is longer than the other, which makes her limp. So do not watch"

11776,LAME SUSIE.,don't shut her out from them because she cannot run and jump as you

11779,LAME SUSIE.,"school, wait, every one of you, in your places till she has passed"
11780,LAME SUSIE.,out; then she will not be jostled or hurt in any way. Her lameness is

11785,LAME SUSIE.,
11786,LAME SUSIE.,"Every hand was instantly raised, and the children's clear, honest eyes"

11827,LAME SUSIE.,The school-room was pleasant still with its cheery fire and bright

11831,LAME SUSIE.,
11832,LAME SUSIE.,"Books and pens dropped from trembling hands, little faces paled, and"

11836,LAME SUSIE.,
11837,LAME SUSIE.,"Only one moved--lame Susie. She limped along as fast as she could, and"

11840,LAME SUSIE.,almost in an instant. Even in that time of peril and dread they
11841,LAME SUSIE.,"remembered their duty and kindness toward her, and gave her the"

12001,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","half the sleeves torn away, and fell open in front for want of a"

12019,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",It was by no means Tim's habit to stand and stare in at the windows of

12022,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","was, generally, too busy in earning his own food--by selling"

12033,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","any heed to Tim, trotting alongside of them with some damp boxes of"

12051,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","those looked different from what he, and folks like him, bought. His"
12052,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","hungry, eager eyes gazed at them, and his teeth and mouth moved now"

12056,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","At last Tim gave a great start. A customer, whom he knew very well,"

12062,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","be there to-night. At any rate, it would be a shelter from the rain,"

12064,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","and it was of no use thinking of going home, where he and his father"
12065,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","had only a corner of a room, and were not welcome to that if they"
12066,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","turned in too soon of an evening. His teacher had finished the bunn,"
12067,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","and was having another wrapped up in a neat paper bag, which he put"
12068,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","carefully into his pocket, and then stepped out into the street, and"
12069,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","walked along under the shelter of a good umbrella, quite unaware that"
12070,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",one of his scholars was pattering along noiselessly behind him with
12071,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",bare feet.
12072,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12073,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",All Tim's thoughts were fixed upon the bunn in his teacher's pocket.
12074,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","He wondered what it would taste like, and whether it would be as"
12075,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","delicious as that one he had once eaten, when all the ragged school"
12076,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","had a treat in Epping Grove--going down in vans, and having real"
12077,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","country milk, and slices of cake to eat, finishing up with a bunn,"
12078,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",which seemed to him as if it must be like the manna he had heard of at
12079,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","school, that used to come down from heaven every morning before the"
12080,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",sun was up. He had never forgotten that lesson; and scarcely a morning
12081,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",came that he did not wish he had lived in those times.
12082,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12083,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","The teacher turned down a dark, narrow street, where the rain had"
12084,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","gathered in little pools on the worn pavement, through which Tim"
12085,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",splashed carelessly. They soon reached the school door; and Tim
12086,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","watched him take off his great-coat, and hang it up on the nails set"
12087,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",apart for the teachers' coats.
12088,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12089,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",Their desk was at a little distance; and he took his place at it among
12090,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the other boys, but his head ached, and his eyes felt dim, and there"
12091,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","was a hungry gnawing within him, which made it impossible to give his"
12092,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","mind to learning his lessons, as he usually did. He felt so stupefied,"
12093,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",that the easiest words--words he knew as well as he knew the way to
12094,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the Mansion House, where he sold his matches--swam before his eyes,"
12095,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",and he called them all wrongly. The other lads laughed and jeered at
12096,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","him, and his teacher was displeased; but Tim could do no better. He"
12097,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",could think of nothing but the dainty bunn in the teacher's pocket.
12098,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12099,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",At last the Scripture lesson came; and it was one that came home to
12100,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","Tim's state. The teacher read aloud first, before hearing them read"
12101,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the lesson, these verses: ""And Jesus, when he came out, saw much"
12102,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were"
12103,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many
12104,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","things. And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto"
12105,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","him,"" etc. Read Mark vi. 34-44."
12106,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12107,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","Tim listened with a swelling heart, and with a feeling of choking in"
12108,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",his throat. He could see it all plainly in his mind. It was like their
12109,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","treat in Epping Grove, where the classes had sat down in ranks upon"
12110,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the green grass; and O, how green and soft the grass was! and the"
12111,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","teachers had come round, like the disciples, giving to each one of"
12112,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",them a can of milk and great pieces of cake; and they had sung a hymn
12113,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",all together before they began to eat and drink. Tim fancied he could
12114,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","see our Saviour as once he had seen him in a beautiful picture, with"
12115,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","his hands outstretched, as if ready to give the children surrounding"
12116,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","him anything they wanted, or to fold them every one in his loving"
12117,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","arms. He thought he saw Jesus, with his loving, gentle face, standing"
12118,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","in the midst of the great crowd of people, and asking the disciples if"
12119,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","they were sure they had all had enough. Then they would sing, thought"
12120,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","Tim, and go home as happy as he had been after that treat in Epping"
12121,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",Grove. All at once his hunger became more than he could bear.
12122,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12123,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""O, I wish He was here!"" he cried, bursting into tears, and laying his"
12124,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","rough head on the desk before him. ""I only wish He was here."""
12125,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12126,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",The other lads looked astonished; for Tim was not given to crying; and
12127,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the teacher stopped in his reading, and touched him to call his"
12128,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",attention.
12129,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12130,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""Who do you wish was here, Tim?"" he asked."
12131,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12132,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""Him,"" sobbed the hungry boy; ""the Lord Jesus. He'd know how bad I"
12133,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","feel. I'd look him in the face, and say, 'Master, what are I to do? I"
12134,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",can't learn nothink when I've got nothink but a griping inside of me.'
12135,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","And he'd think how hungry I was, having nothink to eat all day. He'd"
12136,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","be very sorry--he would, I know."""
12137,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12138,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",Tim did not lift up his head; for his tears and sobs were coming too
12139,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","fast, and he was afraid the other lads would laugh at him. But they"
12140,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",looked serious enough as the meaning of his words broke upon them.
12141,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",They were sure he was not cheating them. If Tim said he had had
12142,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","nothing to eat all day, it must be true; for he never grumbled, and he"
12143,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","always spoke the truth. One boy drew a carrot out of his pocket, and"
12144,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","another pulled out a good piece of bread, wrapped in a bit of"
12145,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","newspaper, while a third ran off to fetch a cup of water, having"
12146,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",nothing else he could give to Tim. The teacher walked away to where
12147,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","his coat was hanging, and came back with the bunn which he had bought"
12148,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",in the shop.
12149,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12150,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""Tim,"" he said, laying his hand kindly on the lad's bowed-down head,"
12151,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""I am very sorry for you; but none of us knew you were starving, my"
12152,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","boy, or I should not have scolded you, and the lads would not have"
12153,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","laughed at you. Look up, and see what a supper we have found for you."""
12154,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12155,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",It looked like a feast to Tim. One of the boys lent him a pocket
12156,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","knife to cut the bread and carrot into slices, with which he took off"
12157,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","the keen edge of his hunger; and then he ate the dainty bunn, which"
12158,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",seemed to him more delicious than anything he had ever tasted before.
12159,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","The rest of the class looked on with delight at his evident enjoyment,"
12160,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",until the last crumb had disappeared.
12161,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12162,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""I could learn anything now,"" said Tim, with a bright face; ""but I"
12163,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",couldn't understand nothink before. Then you began telling about the
12164,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","poor folks being famished with hunger, and how Jesus gave them bread"
12165,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","and fishes, just as if he'd been hungry himself some time, and knew"
12166,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","all about it. It is bad, it is. And it seemed such a pity he weren't"
12167,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","here in the city, and I couldn't go to him. But, I dessay, he knows"
12168,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","how you've all treated me, and I thank you all kindly; and I'll do the"
12169,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","same by you some day, when you've had the same bad luck as me."""
12170,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",
12171,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","""Yes,"" said the teacher, ""Jesus knew how hungry you were; and he knew"
12172,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","how to send you the food you wanted. Tim, and you other lads, I want"
12173,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.","you to learn this verse, and think of it often when you are grown-up"
12174,"TIM, THE MATCH BOY.",men: 'Whosoever shall give to one of these little ones a cup of cold

12254,SQUANKO.,"turning his bright eyes from one to the other, solemnly wagged his"
12255,SQUANKO.,"tail, as if to signify approval."
12256,SQUANKO.,
12257,SQUANKO.,"I was a New Hampshire boy, and this was my first visit to the city. My"
12258,SQUANKO.,experience with dogs previously had been that of a country boy bred up
12259,SQUANKO.,"among sportsmen. I had known several highly-trained hounds, and famous"
12260,SQUANKO.,"bird dogs, though my ideal of canine perfection was that marvel of"
12261,SQUANKO.,"sagacity, the shepherd dog. Still, my first love among dogs had been a"
12262,SQUANKO.,"noble old hound, who, though sightless from age, would follow a rabbit"
12263,SQUANKO.,better than any young dog was capable of doing. The scent of powder
12264,SQUANKO.,"brought back his lost youth. Let him hear the loading of a gun,--or"
12265,SQUANKO.,"the mere rattle of a shot-pouch was enough,--he would break out into"
12266,SQUANKO.,"the wildest gambols, dashing hither and yon, in an ecstasy of delight."
12267,SQUANKO.,
12268,SQUANKO.,"Running headlong against rock or tree, as he was liable to do, only"
12269,SQUANKO.,"tempered his zeal for a moment; the next, he was tearing along more"
12270,SQUANKO.,madly than ever. Dear old Trim! I had shed a boy's hot tears over his
12271,SQUANKO.,"grave on the hill-side, and I was not ashamed of it either."
12272,SQUANKO.,
12273,SQUANKO.,I felt a tenderness for Squanko. The yellow spots which marked his
12274,SQUANKO.,white fur reminded me of Trim's. Remembering the accomplishments of my
12275,SQUANKO.,"lost favorite, I ventured another question."
12276,SQUANKO.,
12277,SQUANKO.,"""What is he good for, aunt Patterson? Can he hunt?"""
12278,SQUANKO.,
12279,SQUANKO.,"""Good for!"" ejaculated my aunt--""_good for!_ I couldn't keep house"
12280,SQUANKO.,"without him."" A certain fine disdain curled her lip; she had utterly"
12281,SQUANKO.,"ignored my second question. Completely quenched, I was fain to accept"
12282,SQUANKO.,"Squanko at once, hunter or no hunter."
12283,SQUANKO.,
12284,SQUANKO.,"And we were, on the whole, pretty good friends, in spite of the"
12285,SQUANKO.,"battles we fought, nearly every evening, for the possession of the"
12286,SQUANKO.,lounge. It made small difference to Squanko if I was beforehand with
12287,SQUANKO.,"him. Though quite a large dog, he would creep up behind me, slowly"
12288,SQUANKO.,"insinuating himself between me and the back of the lounge. Then,"
12289,SQUANKO.,"watching his opportunity, he would brace his feet suddenly, and more"
12290,SQUANKO.,"than once the execution of this manoeuvre sent me rolling,"
12291,SQUANKO.,"ignominiously, upon the floor."
12292,SQUANKO.,
12293,SQUANKO.,"The intruder ousted, his majesty would settle himself for a nap, not"
12294,SQUANKO.,heeding in the least the shouts of laughter which his triumph never
12295,SQUANKO.,failed to evoke.
12296,SQUANKO.,
12297,SQUANKO.,"On all occasions (excepting only nights, when he slept tranquilly on a"
12298,SQUANKO.,rug in my aunt's room) he felt it his duty to keep watch and ward over
12299,SQUANKO.,"the premises. His favorite perch, in sunny mornings, was in the window"
12300,SQUANKO.,of my aunt's chamber. If by any chance the white curtain had not been
12301,SQUANKO.,"looped up, as usual, leaving the window sill exposed, Squanko went"
12302,SQUANKO.,"down for help, and by whining, pulling his mistress's dress and"
12303,SQUANKO.,"similar arts, persuaded her to go up and remove the obnoxious"
12304,SQUANKO.,"curtain. Carefully seating himself upon the sill, which was all too"
12305,SQUANKO.,"narrow for his portly figure, he would fall to work, by barking"
12306,SQUANKO.,"furiously at every person--man, woman, or child--who presumed to pass"
12307,SQUANKO.,"up or down the street. Most fortunately for him, the window he"
12308,SQUANKO.,"occupied overlooked the lawn at the side of the house, instead of the"
12309,SQUANKO.,pavement in front; for on several occasions his fury became so
12310,SQUANKO.,"ungovernable, that he barked himself sheer off his foundation."
12311,SQUANKO.,
12312,SQUANKO.,"Catching a glimpse of his whirling figure, my aunt rushed out, armed"
12313,SQUANKO.,"with a bottle of liniment; and while she bathed his imperilled legs,"
12314,SQUANKO.,she strove also to soothe his outraged feelings. For the time all
12315,SQUANKO.,vanity seemed to have been dashed out of him; but comforted by
12316,SQUANKO.,"sympathy and caresses, he again mounted his perch, and barked with"
12317,SQUANKO.,undiminished ardor.
12318,SQUANKO.,
12319,SQUANKO.,"At table, my aunt always occupied what is termed an office chair."
12320,SQUANKO.,"Being quite small in person, a portion of the great leather cushion,"
12321,SQUANKO.,"at the back, was left vacant. Squanko rarely failed to possess himself"
12322,SQUANKO.,"of this vantage-ground, and squatting thereon, peered wisely over his"
12323,SQUANKO.,"mistress's shoulder, as if studying the problem of what portion of the"
12324,SQUANKO.,goodly meal before him might safely be counted on as a remainder.
12325,SQUANKO.,
12326,SQUANKO.,"Yet Squanko had his grievances. One was, not being allowed the freedom"
12327,SQUANKO.,"of the garden. If he went out, my aunt's careful hand hastened to link"
12328,SQUANKO.,"the long chain, attached to his house, to his collar. She had a"
12329,SQUANKO.,chronic fear of his running away.
12330,SQUANKO.,
12331,SQUANKO.,Squanko utterly disdained to occupy the bed of straw which graced his
12332,SQUANKO.,"dwelling, but climbing to a board which surmounted the ridge of the"
12333,SQUANKO.,"roof, would lie upon that narrow ledge, ready to pounce upon any one"
12334,SQUANKO.,who ventured near.
12335,SQUANKO.,
12336,SQUANKO.,"Missing him one morning, both here and on the window-sill, one of the"
12337,SQUANKO.,"wee Johnnys of the neighborhood, who stood in wholesome awe of"
12338,SQUANKO.,"Squanko, put his curly head in at the doorway."
12339,SQUANKO.,
12340,SQUANKO.,"""Where's Squanko, Mrs. Patterson?"""
12341,SQUANKO.,
12342,SQUANKO.,"""Gone to walk."""
12343,SQUANKO.,
12344,SQUANKO.,"""_Gone to walk_,"" chuckled Johnny, bursting with merriment. ""That's"
12345,SQUANKO.,"funny--_a dog gone to walk_!"""
12346,SQUANKO.,
12347,SQUANKO.,Squanko's _walk_ was rarely omitted; generally it was performed under
12348,SQUANKO.,"my aunt's tutelage, when she went a little way with her husband, whose"
12349,SQUANKO.,"business took him to the city every morning. If, for any reason, Mrs."
12350,SQUANKO.,"Patterson let her husband go to the cars alone, she sent Squanko off"
12351,SQUANKO.,"by himself, with strict orders to return speedily, which direction he"
12352,SQUANKO.,had never failed to obey.
12353,SQUANKO.,
12354,SQUANKO.,"Besides his chain, Squanko had one other trial to endure--a thorough"
12355,SQUANKO.,"ablution once a week. Bathing was his aversion; still, he had been"
12356,SQUANKO.,"obliged to submit to it from his puppyhood, and Mrs. Patterson was"
12357,SQUANKO.,inexorable. A dog who was not faultlessly clean could have no place in
12358,SQUANKO.,the arrangements of her household. In and about her dwelling all was
12359,SQUANKO.,"spotlessly neat. Everything susceptible of polish shone, from the"
12360,SQUANKO.,"window-panes, and the great cooking-stove, to Squanko's white coat. In"
12361,SQUANKO.,"vain were his protests, his indignant snorts and sneezes, his"
12362,SQUANKO.,"incipient growls; into the tub of warm water he had to go, while the"
12363,SQUANKO.,scrubbing-brush performed its office upon his fat sides. Having been
12364,SQUANKO.,"duly washed and wiped, he always indulged in a vicious shake or two,"
12365,SQUANKO.,producing a sort of mist in his immediate vicinity. After being
12366,SQUANKO.,"wrapped in his own blanket shawl, he was placed on the lounge, to"
12367,SQUANKO.,"repose while drying. His luxurious nap completed, he would emerge"
12368,SQUANKO.,"from his retirement, his short white hair shining like satin,--as"
12369,SQUANKO.,"clean a playfellow as one might desire. His temper,--not usually of"
12370,SQUANKO.,"the best,--after one of these baths, would remain sunny for hours."
12371,SQUANKO.,
12372,SQUANKO.,"But Squanko--like many another spoiled darling,--was not content with"
12373,SQUANKO.,the home where he was so petted and indulged.
12374,SQUANKO.,
12375,SQUANKO.,"As his master opened the door to go into the garden, one evening,"
12376,SQUANKO.,"Squanko rushed past him, and made for the street. In vain our hurried"
12377,SQUANKO.,"search, up and down, in the dark spring night. In vain his mistress's"
12378,SQUANKO.,"frantic calls. If Squanko was hidden in some nook hard by, and heard"
12379,SQUANKO.,"her entreaties, his heart must have been harder than a stone. That"
12380,SQUANKO.,hasty exit was the last we ever saw of him. Night after night my
12381,SQUANKO.,"uncle, coming home from the city, inquired for Squanko, only to"
12382,SQUANKO.,"receive the sad reply,--"
12383,SQUANKO.,

12683,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"Kindness did all this--nothing else. Any cat can be taught to ""roll"

12685,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,you will treat her well.

12687,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,It is precisely thus with wild animals. They know who their friends

12697,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"the lion was called--was shut up in his cage in the Tower, he became"
12698,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,sulky and savage to such an extent that it was dangerous even for his
12699,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"keeper, who was not over kind to him, to approach him."
12700,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12701,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"After Nero had been a prisoner for some weeks, a party of sailors,"
12702,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"Jack being among the number, paid a visit to the menagerie. The keeper"
12703,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"warned them not to go near the lion, who every now and then turned"
12704,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,round to growl defiance to the spectators.
12705,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12706,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"""What! old shipmate!"" cried Jack, ""don't you know me? What cheer, old"
12707,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"Nero, my lad?"""
12708,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12709,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"Instantly the lion left off growling, sprang up to the bars of his"
12710,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"cage, and put his nose between them. Jack patted it on the head, and"
12711,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"it rubbed his hand with its whiskers like a cat, showing evident signs"
12712,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,of pleasure.
12713,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12714,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"""Ah,"" said Jack, turning to the keeper and spectators who stood"
12715,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"looking on with astonishment, ""Nero and I were shipmates, and you see"
12716,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"he isn't like some folks; he don't forget an old friend."""

12719,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12720,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,But here's a story of another sort. Some weeks ago a caravan was
12721,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"exhibiting in Illinois. Among the animals was an elephant, to whom a"
12722,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,mischievous boy had given an apple with tobacco concealed inside. As
12723,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"soon as the animal discovered the trick, the boy began to laugh at"
12724,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"the joke which he had played on the creature. The elephant, however,"
12725,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"looked angry, and the keeper, having heard of the affair, told the boy"
12726,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"to keep out of his reach, unless he wanted to be hurt."
12727,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,
12728,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"But, although the lad did not come so near that the elephant could get"
12729,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"hold of him, he hung round in the vicinity. Presently a pail of water"
12730,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,was brought for the elephant to drink. The insulted creature filled
12731,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"his trunk as full as he could, and seeing a good opportunity, blew the"
12732,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"whole of it upon the boy who had given him tobacco, wetting him from"
12733,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"head to foot. Verdict of the spectators, and of the readers of this"
12734,KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.,"book, ""Served him right."""

12772,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"A lady, having gone rather early into an apartment in which she had a"
12773,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"fine canary, whose cage hung on the knob of the window-shutter, was"
12774,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,much surprised to find the bird sitting asleep in the bottom of the
12775,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"cage, side by side with a live mouse, also asleep. On raising the"
12776,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"window-blind, the mouse squeezed itself through between the wires of"
12777,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"the cage and fled. The box of seeds, crumbs, etc., intended for the"
12778,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"canary was found to be cleaned out, doubtless devoured by the strange"
12779,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"companion. On the following evening, while the lady and her husband"
12780,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"were sitting quietly by the fireside, they were still further"
12781,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,astonished at seeing a mouse (no doubt the same one) climbing nimbly
12782,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,up the shutter and entering the cage between the wires. Thinking it
12783,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"might do harm to the bird, they tried to catch the mouse, but it made"
12784,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"its escape as before. The cage was then suspended from a nail, so that"
12785,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"the mouse could not gain access. Strange to say, however, on the"
12786,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,following morning the canary was found asleep on the floor of the room
12787,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,"(the cage door having been left open), and a piece of potato beside"
12788,THE MOUSE AND CANARY.,him. Most likely the mouse had spent the whole of the night there.

12799,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12800,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Many years ago two youths, whom we will call only by their Christian"
12801,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"names,--Walter and Sidney,--were at the same boarding-school, at"
12802,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Mount's Bay, in Cornwall. They were each the sons of captains in the"
12803,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"merchant service; but though they were equals in station, there was a"
12804,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"great difference in their circumstances, for Walter inherited"
12805,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"considerable property. Sidney's father had not been a prosperous man,"
12806,A STORY FOR BOYS.,and it was as much as he could do to give his boy a good education.
12807,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12808,A STORY FOR BOYS.,Among the whole school there were no two lads so closely knit in
12809,A STORY FOR BOYS.,friendship as Walter and Sidney; they were within a week of the same
12810,A STORY FOR BOYS.,age (thirteen) at the time our narrative begins. It is always a
12811,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"pleasant sight, and also a good example, when two intelligent,"
12812,A STORY FOR BOYS.,kind-hearted boys become friends. They show to others what a
12813,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"disinterested and noble thing true friendship is. Thus, in their"
12814,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"lessons and their sports, these boys were helpful to each other. They"
12815,A STORY FOR BOYS.,shared together every indulgence that the kindness of friends procured
12816,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"them, and if any added study were imposed, Sidney, who learned easily,"
12817,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"would, after he had swiftly mastered his own lesson, take upon himself"
12818,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"both the office of teacher and companion, and never rest until Walter"
12819,A STORY FOR BOYS.,was as well up in the task as he himself was. Most certainly the
12820,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"punishment of one was ever the punishment of both, for, if they were"
12821,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"sharers in each other's joys, they were not the less so in their"
12822,A STORY FOR BOYS.,troubles. Perhaps the vigilance which each exercised over the other
12823,A STORY FOR BOYS.,was the reason why they were comparatively seldom in any very serious
12824,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"disgrace, and their characters stood high in the school, both with"
12825,A STORY FOR BOYS.,masters and pupils.
12826,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12827,A STORY FOR BOYS.,But while in the little world within the walls of the school all went
12828,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"equally well with the youthful friends, in the great world outside,"
12829,A STORY FOR BOYS.,heavy troubles came to Sidney's father. The vessel he commanded was
12830,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"lost near the mouth of the River Mersey, and though the crew were"
12831,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"saved, yet it was judged that some mismanagement caused the disaster,"
12832,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"and Sidney's father lost his certificate, and no owners would again"
12833,A STORY FOR BOYS.,trust him to command a vessel. The poor man took this so much to heart
12834,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"that he fell into a bad state of health, and declined so rapidly, that"
12835,A STORY FOR BOYS.,the week after Sidney received from Liverpool the first intimation of
12836,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"his father's illness, tidings came that he was dead."
12837,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12838,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"It was in the autumnal quarter, about eight weeks before Christmas,"
12839,A STORY FOR BOYS.,that the sad letter was received which told Sidney he was now an
12840,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"orphan. The only aunt the poor boy had, his father's sister, wrote the"
12841,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"account, and she was obliged to add the painful fact that, with the"
12842,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"loss of his father, Sidney would lose the means of further education,"
12843,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"and must look forward to some humble means of earning his daily bread,"
12844,A STORY FOR BOYS.,with as little delay as possible.
12845,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12846,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"[Illustration: ""Why, Sid,--what's this? Dear old fellow, what's the"
12847,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"matter?""]"
12848,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12849,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"In his first great grief at hearing of his father's death, all else"
12850,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"seemed trivial. Change of circumstances, hard work, any trouble, would"
12851,A STORY FOR BOYS.,have been as nothing if his father had been spared to him. But after
12852,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the first shock of his sorrow, Sidney admitted that he must leave"
12853,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"school; that it would not be honest, either to his aunt or his"
12854,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"schoolmaster, to remain. Strangely enough, the very week in which"
12855,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"this trouble came to Sidney, his friend Walter was at home for a few"
12856,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"days, joining in the celebration of his father's fiftieth birthday. He"
12857,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"had wanted Sidney to have a holiday also; but the latter, being"
12858,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"already aware of his father's reverses and illness, though having no"
12859,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"fear of any greater grief impending over him, had declined his"
12860,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"friend's kind invitation. So it happened that, while a happy jubilee"
12861,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"was being celebrated in Walter's home, Sidney was suddenly made a poor"
12862,A STORY FOR BOYS.,orphan.
12863,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12864,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Never, during the three years that they had been school-fellows, had"
12865,A STORY FOR BOYS.,the countenances of the two boys showed such a contrast of expression
12866,A STORY FOR BOYS.,as when they met in the playground a few minutes after Walter had
12867,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"alighted at the gate, on his return from the pleasant sojourn at his"
12868,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"home. He was flushed with health and happiness, and ran up, with a"
12869,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"boyish shout of mirth, to greet his friend. Poor Sidney, pale and"
12870,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"choking with the effort to restrain his tears, could only grasp the"
12871,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"proffered hand in silence, and turn away his head, unable to look"
12872,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"up,--almost unable to bear the pent-up grief that throbbed at his"
12873,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"heart, and tightened his chest with a sense of suffocation."
12874,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12875,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""Why, Sid, what's this? Dear old fellow, what's the matter?"" was"
12876,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Walter's astonished inquiry, when a boy near whispered in his ear the"
12877,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"brief words,--"
12878,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12879,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""His father's dead!"""
12880,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12881,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"That explained all; and Walter, twining his arm round his friend, led"
12882,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"him away to a quiet spot, where they could weep together. The greater"
12883,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"grief so completely absorbed Sidney on his first meeting with Walter,"
12884,A STORY FOR BOYS.,that it was not until the next day that any mention was made between
12885,A STORY FOR BOYS.,them of how this bereavement would affect the future. Young and
12886,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"prosperous as Walter was, he knew well enough how sad it would be for"
12887,A STORY FOR BOYS.,his friend to lose the advantages of education just at the time when
12888,A STORY FOR BOYS.,his studies would be needed to fit him for some pursuit in life.
12889,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12890,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Meanwhile, as Sidney's aunt had not been able to send the money for"
12891,A STORY FOR BOYS.,the poor lad to go so long a journey as from West Cornwall to
12892,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Liverpool, to attend his father's funeral, there was no immediate"
12893,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"hurry at the school in preparing for the youth's departure. Walter,"
12894,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"therefore, had time to carry out a plan which his affection suggested."
12895,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"He wrote an urgent letter to his father, filled with praises of"
12896,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Sidney, and accounts of all the help which his cleverness and conduct"
12897,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"had afforded to him (Walter), and earnestly pleading that he might"
12898,A STORY FOR BOYS.,have the gratification of paying for a year or more schooling for his
12899,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"orphan friend, adding, as a concluding argument,--"
12900,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12901,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""You know, papa, that I have forty pounds that aunt Margaret put in"
12902,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the savings bank for me, to do as I like with; and how could I spend"
12903,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"it better, or so well, as in helping a good clever fellow like Sidney?"
12904,A STORY FOR BOYS.,It would be a real treat to me--the best I could have; and you
12905,A STORY FOR BOYS.,promised to increase my pocket-money: you needn't; I can screw myself
12906,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"down famously, if you'll only give it to help Sid, who's always been"
12907,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"helping me, I can tell you."""
12908,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12909,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Walter was too earnest, it seemed, to pick and choose his words. He"
12910,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"meant to have corrected and rewritten his letter, but there was no"
12911,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"time; so he sent it, faults and all. And his father, in reading it,"
12912,A STORY FOR BOYS.,felt the heart-throb that beat in his boy's generous words; and though
12913,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"a man not at all demonstrative, he was observed to be taken as if with"
12914,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"a sudden cold in his head, to judge by the vigorous use of his pocket"
12915,A STORY FOR BOYS.,handkerchief; but all he said was conveyed in a single nautical
12916,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"phrase,--""The youngster is on the right tack."""
12917,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12918,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"The day after, the principal of the Mount's Bay School received an"
12919,A STORY FOR BOYS.,intimation that Sidney was to continue his studies there as long as
12920,A STORY FOR BOYS.,he proved diligent; but the name of his patron was not to be told him.
12921,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"So, to the lad's great satisfaction, he was informed that a friend who"
12922,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"had known his father would, for the present, help him. Walter knew the"
12923,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"truth, but though he felt the intense joy that a good action always"
12924,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"yields to the doer even more than to the receiver, he was careful to"
12925,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"obey his father, and keep the secret."
12926,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12927,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"If Sidney was studious before, he redoubled his diligence now, and in"
12928,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the year made such great progress, that a Dutch gentleman, who visited"
12929,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the school, offered him a situation in his office at Rotterdam; and as"
12930,A STORY FOR BOYS.,Sidney knew that a residence abroad would be a great improvement to
12931,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"him, and also was eager to enter upon some mode of earning his own"
12932,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"living, he wished earnestly to take the offer. At no time during their"
12933,A STORY FOR BOYS.,now four years of mutual school-life and friendship would Walter have
12934,A STORY FOR BOYS.,heard with patience of Sidney leaving. But a parting now came.
12935,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12936,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Walter's father had become an invalid, and was ordered to a warmer"
12937,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"climate. The family removed to Florence, in Italy, and, of course,"
12938,A STORY FOR BOYS.,Walter went with them; his greatest grief being that Sidney could not
12939,A STORY FOR BOYS.,accompany them.
12940,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12941,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"With the keenest pangs of youthful sorrow, the two friends parted,"
12942,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"promising to write often, looking forward to meet at no distant"
12943,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"future, for the world did not seem too wide for them, accustomed as"
12944,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"they were, by association, to maritime people and travellers."
12945,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12946,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"It was three months after Walter had left, when Sidney took leave of"
12947,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"his kind master, and the school which had been a home to him, and"
12948,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"went, in cold spring weather, to the Venice of the north--Rotterdam."
12949,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"When he left he made one request, which his tutor thought it not wrong"
12950,A STORY FOR BOYS.,to grant. He desired to know the name of the benefactor who had so
12951,A STORY FOR BOYS.,munificently helped him; and though he was not very much surprised
12952,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"when he heard the source from whence the aid had come, and was indeed"
12953,A STORY FOR BOYS.,glad that his gratitude was due where his friendship had so long been
12954,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"given, yet it naturally moved him very deeply when he found how Walter"
12955,A STORY FOR BOYS.,had been the means of effecting this. He also remembered vividly some
12956,A STORY FOR BOYS.,acts of self-denial that added to the delicacy of his friend's
12957,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"silence, and made the action truly noble."
12958,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12959,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""I can never repay you, dear Walter, nor your kind father; I shall"
12960,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"ever be your grateful debtor,"" he wrote; ""but I will try to employ the"
12961,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"talents you have cultivated, so as not, at all events, to disgrace"
12962,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"your friendship."""
12963,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12964,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Though railways made the continent open to travellers, and the desire"
12965,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"to see his friend Walter never languished, yet years went by and it"
12966,A STORY FOR BOYS.,was not realized. Some tidings there were of reverse of fortune
12967,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"through a lawsuit, and of journeyings to different places. The last"
12968,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"that Sidney heard of his friend was in a letter from Madeira, where"
12969,A STORY FOR BOYS.,his father was lingering on in too weak a state to bear removal.
12970,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12971,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"The desultory, unsettled life that the family had led seemed to have"
12972,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"prevented Walter from making much progress as a sculptor,--a"
12973,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"profession he had thought of while in Italy,--and his letters were"
12974,A STORY FOR BOYS.,somewhat vague and unsatisfactory as to his future plans.
12975,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12976,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Then came a long interval with no tidings, and afterwards a returned"
12977,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"letter with the one word DEAD, written under the name of Walter's"
12978,A STORY FOR BOYS.,father on the superscription.
12979,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12980,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"So, like a pleasant morning that ends in clouds and gloom, the"
12981,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"friendship seemed to end which had so gladdened the youth of Sidney,"
12982,A STORY FOR BOYS.,and even blended with all the fondest memories of his boyhood. Many
12983,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"were the prayers he breathed, that one who had been as a brother might"
12984,A STORY FOR BOYS.,not be entirely lost to him.
12985,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12986,A STORY FOR BOYS.,As years went on great changes occurred in the firm that Sidney
12987,A STORY FOR BOYS.,served. He had risen in the confidence of his employers. They had a
12988,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"business in Australia, under the care of a partner, who was also a"
12989,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"relative. He died, and as there was a sudden increase of business"
12990,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"facilities at Melbourne, Sidney was sent out, and a share in the"
12991,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"concern was given him. His surname did not appear. He was announced,"
12992,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"as many a junior partner is, by the little word ""Co."" appended to the"
12993,A STORY FOR BOYS.,principal name of the firm.
12994,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
12995,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Sidney had been in the colony some three years, and was now a stalwart"
12996,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"young man of twenty-seven, when one day, riding on horseback towards a"
12997,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"suburb of the rapidly growing city of Melbourne, called Brighton, he"
12998,A STORY FOR BOYS.,noticed a gang of young men working on the road. He knew that many
12999,A STORY FOR BOYS.,respectable emigrants had come over during the first excitement of the
13000,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"gold discoveries. Clerks used only to the pen, students, unsuccessful"
13001,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"professional men, all in the first delirium fever-fit of the gold"
13002,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"fever, had come in the expectation that hands unused to hard toil"
13003,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"could use the pickaxe of the gold-digger, or wash the rubble for the"
13004,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"precious ore. Ah, it was a wild, a fatal delusion! Many a gentleman"
13005,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"and scholar pined to death with hardships and disappointments, while"
13006,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"some, after weeks of sickness, rose to earn their bread by the"
13007,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"humblest manual labor. Working on the roads, for which government pay"
13008,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"was given, was often the resource of those who had been worsted in"
13009,A STORY FOR BOYS.,every other effort. Unable to help among such numbers of claimants on
13010,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"sympathy, Sidney had contented himself with joining in the"
13011,A STORY FOR BOYS.,subscriptions raised for the relief of the sick and destitute: but
13012,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"now, as he passed along, he felt a desire to speak to the workers in"
13013,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"this gang. As his eye scanned them he saw only a group of thin,"
13014,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"toil-worn, weather-beaten men, with rough beards half hiding their"
13015,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"wasted features. Nothing was more acceptable, as a recreation to the"
13016,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"emigrants, than books, and Sidney had commenced a lending library of"
13017,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"books and publications; so, after a cheerful salutation, he now reined"
13018,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"up his horse, and began to tell them of his plan, and to add, ""I have"
13019,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"opened a room, friends, two nights a week,--it is but a rough shed,"
13020,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"but I hope to make it better soon,--as a meeting-place, where a"
13021,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"comfortable, pleasant, and profitable evening may be spent."""
13022,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13023,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""Then,"" said a man with a strong Irish brogue, ""your honor's the great"
13024,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Dutch merchant."""
13025,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13026,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""Yes, at the Dutch merchant's store; but I am English; my name is"
13027,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Sidney--"""
13028,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13029,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"There was a wild panting sort of cry, and a man in the group fell to"
13030,A STORY FOR BOYS.,the ground.
13031,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13032,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""He's in a fit."" ""He oughtn't to have come."" ""Poor fellow!"" ""Fetch"
13033,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"water!"" ""Give him air!"" These were the cries that were uttered."
13034,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Meanwhile, throwing his horse's bridle over a post, Sidney dismounted,"
13035,A STORY FOR BOYS.,and helped to lift in his strong arms the tall but wasted form of a
13036,A STORY FOR BOYS.,man from the ground. He was borne to a bank at the side of the road.
13037,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Sidney put aside the matted hair that fell over his brow, and taking"
13038,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the pannikin, which some one had filled with water, he put it to his"
13039,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"lips, wholly unconscious that he had ever seen that face before, until"
13040,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"the eyes slowly opened, and the old expression, the soul-gaze, shone"
13041,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"in them, and the hoarse and altered voice, yet with tones that woke"
13042,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"old echoes, said, ""Sidney! Dear friend! Don't--don't you know"
13043,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"me--Walter?"""
13044,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13045,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Walter! Yes it was he. The once blooming, prosperous, happy boy was"
13046,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"this wasted, worn skeleton of a man. O, the tide of feeling that"
13047,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"rushed through Sidney's every vein, as he recognized his early"
13048,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"friend--his benefactor! To raise him up, put him on his own horse,"
13049,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"lead him gently to his own home, and, once there, to send for the best"
13050,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"medical skill, and tend him through the illness that supervened, with"
13051,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"a tenderness feminine in its thoughtful gentleness, was Sidney's"
13052,A STORY FOR BOYS.,privilege.
13053,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13054,A STORY FOR BOYS.,In the intervals of his illness Walter related that his father had
13055,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"died at Madeira; that, hoping to obtain a settlement of some claims,"
13056,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"he had visited America; that, waiting to have better news of himself"
13057,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"to communicate, he put off writing from time to time; that he had gone"
13058,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"with a company of adventurous young men to California, and there,"
13059,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"instead of finding gold, spent all his means. Hoping to retrieve his"
13060,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"position, he had come to Australia, and there his lot, though hard,"
13061,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"was only that of hundreds, in the first trying time of mad excitement"
13062,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"and wild adventure. ""And I must get to work again. I'm not going to be"
13063,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"here idle much longer,"" he said, at the conclusion of a conversation"
13064,A STORY FOR BOYS.,on the past.
13065,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13066,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""As to work, I've plenty for you to do."""
13067,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13068,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""I can't continue to be a burden on you, Sid. I've no claim."""
13069,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13070,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""You've every claim. As to burdens, you remind me how long I was a"
13071,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"burden on you and your father. Once for all, I say, the help you gave"
13072,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"me fitted me to get my living, and, by God's blessing, to make my way"
13073,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"in life. Share with me in my business."""
13074,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13075,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Walter was beginning to interrupt; but Sidney, raising his hand,"
13076,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"deprecatingly, said,--"
13077,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13078,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"""You have still the advantage over me, that you gave me help when I"
13079,A STORY FOR BOYS.,had done nothing to deserve it of you. I only make a small
13080,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"repayment--a mere instalment of a great debt. Dear Walter, my good"
13081,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"fellow, let there be no contest between us. Are we not friends? Does"
13082,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"that not mean helpers?"""
13083,A STORY FOR BOYS.,
13084,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"And so it was. The tie, never broken, was knit again yet more closely."
13085,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Brothers in friendship, they ultimately became so in relationship; for"
13086,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"as soon as Walter had a home, he invited a sister to share it with"
13087,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"him, and she, in a few months after her arrival, became the wife of"
13088,A STORY FOR BOYS.,"Sidney. And so the bond of brotherhood prospered, for many years."

13094,PUSS.,
13095,PUSS.,
13096,PUSS.,"Is it not a little more than surprising that the common domestic cat,"
13097,PUSS.,"an animal which we are better acquainted with than the dog, should be"
13098,PUSS.,permitted to grow up with so little instruction? I think so. Almost
13099,PUSS.,every dog has some tricks; many dogs have a great number. Yet how
13100,PUSS.,rarely do you see a cat of which anything more is expected than that
13101,PUSS.,"she shall purr when she is petted, play with your ball of yarn, or"
13102,PUSS.,growl when you give her a nice dinner.
13103,PUSS.,
13104,PUSS.,[Illustration: MUFFY RINGING THE BELL.]
13105,PUSS.,
13106,PUSS.,"You teach your dog to bark at the word of command, to roll over, to"
13107,PUSS.,"stand upon his hind feet, and hold up his paws, to jump through a"
13108,PUSS.,"small hoop, to sing, and a thousand other pretty tricks; but why do"
13109,PUSS.,"you neglect your cat? You can teach her all these things,--except to"
13110,PUSS.,"bark,--and quite as easily. Any cat, not more than a year old, can be"
13111,PUSS.,"taught, in less than fifteen days, to ""roll over;"" and she learns"
13112,PUSS.,other capers quite as freely. Bear in mind that to do this you have to
13113,PUSS.,appeal to the creature's love of food. That is her nature. She cares
13114,PUSS.,"nothing for you; it is the dinner she is after. So, when you desire"
13115,PUSS.,"to teach puss to turn over, take her when she is hungry. Put your hand"
13116,PUSS.,"upon her back, and turn her over; and then give her a small bit of"
13117,PUSS.,meat. Gradually she will require less and less force. She will
13118,PUSS.,"understand what you want, and know what must be done in order to be"
13119,PUSS.,"served. Never disappoint her, but let the food immediately follow"
13120,PUSS.,obedience. Other tricks may be taught in the same way. If you wish to
13121,PUSS.,"teach her to go through a hoop, you will be obliged at first to take"
13122,PUSS.,"her up bodily, and put her through. But this will not be for a great"
13123,PUSS.,while. She will soon understand what you desire.
13124,PUSS.,
13125,PUSS.,I once had a cat which would open any door in the house. She learned
13126,PUSS.,"herself! The latch-doors came pretty easy, but the knobs bothered her"
13127,PUSS.,"a good deal. She persevered, however, and became an expert at either."
13128,PUSS.,
13129,PUSS.,I have a cat now--a Maltese--which is a marvel of intelligence. There
13130,PUSS.,seems to be no end to her interesting feats. She is terribly rough at
13131,PUSS.,"play; if you impose upon her, you must look out for her claws. She"
13132,PUSS.,watches for my coming from the city quite regularly; and as soon as I
13133,PUSS.,"sit down to read, she plants herself in my lap. She had some kittens a"
13134,PUSS.,"few weeks ago. One evening, soon after, as I sat in the rocking-chair,"
13135,PUSS.,"with my newspaper, puss came into the room with one of her kittens in"
13136,PUSS.,"her mouth. She placed it carefully in my lap, and immediately went for"
13137,PUSS.,the other one.
13138,PUSS.,
13139,PUSS.,A neighbor of mine has a cat which rings a bell when she is hungry.
13140,PUSS.,"The bell is a small one, and hangs about a yard high, so that Miss"
13141,PUSS.,Puss has to exert herself to reach it.
13142,PUSS.,
13143,PUSS.,Another cat I heard of recently seems to have discovered a way to get
13144,PUSS.,into the warm kitchen whenever she is accidentally shut out in the
13145,PUSS.,cold.
13146,PUSS.,
13147,PUSS.,"At the side wall of the house there is a small aperture, of about two"
13148,PUSS.,"feet square, opening into the kitchen, and intended for the use and"
13149,PUSS.,"convenience of butchers, bakers, or grocers, who would otherwise have"
13150,PUSS.,to go round to the back entrance; inside of this aperture is suspended
13151,PUSS.,"a bell, which Miss Muffy must, no doubt, have often seen used by"
13152,PUSS.,"butchers, bakers, and grocers, to call the attention of cook. She has,"
13153,PUSS.,"therefore, adopted the same plan; and when tired of her prowlings"
13154,PUSS.,"about the garden, or hunting for birds in the adjoining wood, she"
13155,PUSS.,"springs up to the little door, and, with her paw or head, keeps ring,"
13156,PUSS.,"ring, ringing at the bell until the door is opened, and she gets"
13157,PUSS.,admission.
13158,PUSS.,
13159,PUSS.,"Muffy is not only a very intelligent little cat, but I can tell you"
13160,PUSS.,"she is also a very good-natured one, too. She submits to being dressed"
13161,PUSS.,"in the doll's clothes, and will sometimes lie quite still in the"
13162,PUSS.,"cradle for hours together, and when told to stand upon her hind legs"
13163,PUSS.,"and give a kiss, does so with a gracefulness hitherto unknown in the"
13164,PUSS.,annals of cats.
13165,PUSS.,
13166,PUSS.,These funny marks of intelligence in dumb creatures are quite
13167,PUSS.,"interesting. As you grow older, you will spend many an hour in trying"
13168,PUSS.,to discover where the dividing line between INSTINCT and REASON is. It
13169,PUSS.,"is SOMEWHERE. If you hatch some chickens by heat, miles away from any"
13170,PUSS.,"other fowls, the hens will cackle, and the cocks will crow, all the"
13171,PUSS.,"same, although no one has taught them. Why is it?"
13172,PUSS.,
13173,PUSS.,"If you could hatch a robin's egg in the same way, far removed from"
13174,PUSS.,"other birds, the bird would, when grown, build its nest precisely as"
13175,PUSS.,"other robins do, and of the same material, although it never saw a"
13176,PUSS.,"pattern in the world. INSTINCT, or, if you prefer, NATURE, teaches all"
13177,PUSS.,"this. But it is not REASON, as you will know as you grow older."
13178,PUSS.,
13179,PUSS.,Just exactly so it is the instinct of a dog or a cat to obey you
13180,PUSS.,whenever you require it. Take notice that you can never teach a dumb
13181,PUSS.,creature by observation. One cat will never learn to turn over by
13182,PUSS.,observing that another one gets its food thereby.
13183,PUSS.,
13184,PUSS.,But I will not try to mix you up in this discussion now. You will
13185,PUSS.,"reach it soon enough if you live. And when you reach it, you will find"
13186,PUSS.,"a very difficult, as well as a very interesting question to solve."

13229,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13230,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"For a short time the children remained in Mrs. Constant's room,"

13233,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13234,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""I think you had better take a run in the garden,"" she finally said."
13235,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""You are so restless and full of holiday, I think the fresh air would"
13236,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"relieve you."""
13237,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13238,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""What a dear mother!"" they cried; and having tumultuously kissed her,"
13239,HOLIDAY LUCK.,they repaired to the garden.
13240,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13241,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"They lived in a country town, and had a large plot of ground at the"
13242,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"back of the house, through the farther end of which flowed a brook."
13243,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Each one had his garden bed, and at one side was a summer-house, where"
13244,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"they kept their garden tools and many of their playthings, also a pet"
13245,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"rabbit, named Blackhawk. It was too late in the fall for flowers, only"
13246,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"a few sturdy asters and hardy verbenas being in blossom, and they"
13247,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"played tag, hide-and-seek, and chased each other with handfuls of dead"
13248,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"leaves. While they were thus occupied, their mother called them, and"
13249,HOLIDAY LUCK.,told them that aunt Clara had sent for her to come and spend the day;
13250,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"she had sprained her ankle, and wanted some one to sit with her."
13251,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13252,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Won't you be home to dinner?"" they asked in despairing chorus."
13253,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13254,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""No; but Mary will take care of you, and you can enjoy yourselves; but"
13255,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"don't do foolish things, or your holiday will be spoiled. Now, you"
13256,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"must all be mother to each other, that I may find you well and happy"
13257,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"when I come home."""
13258,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13259,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"For a while after she had gone, they amused themselves being mother to"
13260,HOLIDAY LUCK.,one another; but Willie made such a failure that they gave it up.
13261,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13262,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Let us play with the dolls a little while,"" suggested Dolly."
13263,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13264,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"The proposition met with favor, and they went to the summer-house. Ada"
13265,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"had a large family of paper dolls, and Dolly of wooden ones. They"
13266,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"played tea party, and dinner, and visiting; but Willie could not"
13267,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"forget that they had a holiday, and he longed to do something unusual."
13268,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13269,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""You have too many girls, Ada,"" he cried. ""Let us play China, and burn"
13270,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"some up."""
13271,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13272,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"A funeral pyre was soon constructed with splinters of wood, Dolly ran"
13273,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"to the kitchen for matches, and Willie turned his jacket inside out,"
13274,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"tied Ada's sack about his neck by the sleeves, put the watering-pot on"
13275,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"his head, and was ready to personate the priest. Ada selected four"
13276,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"victims, who were securely bound with thirty cotton, and laid on the"
13277,HOLIDAY LUCK.,pile.
13278,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13279,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Let us have Blackhawk for the idol,"" cried Ada."
13280,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13281,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Blackhawk was brought forth, a string of colored beads put about his"
13282,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"neck, and he was bolstered up in the arm-chair of the Princess"

13284,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"applied with a great flourish, he sprang from his throne, and fled to"
13285,HOLIDAY LUCK.,the farthest corner.
13286,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13287,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""The god is displeased; the sacrifice must cease,"" cried Ada, who"

13289,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13290,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""No,"" shouted Willie, ""I am the priest; I know he means burn all;"" and"
13291,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"seizing a brand, he applied it to Dolly's village, which stood near"
13292,HOLIDAY LUCK.,by. For a moment it was fun to see the flames bursting from the roofs
13293,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"of houses, and lapping about the fences; but Dolly soon gave a cry of"
13294,HOLIDAY LUCK.,dismay.
13295,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13296,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Susanna and Posy are in the church; I don't want them burned."""
13297,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13298,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""To the rescue!"" shouted the heathen priest, snatching the pot from"
13299,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"his head, and running to fill it with water."
13300,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13301,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"But Dolly could not wait, and had already burned a hole in her apron,"
13302,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"and singed her hair, trying to save her favorites. Blackhawk cowered"
13303,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"in the corner, stamping his hind feet, while Ada was pulling apart the"
13304,HOLIDAY LUCK.,pyre on which her dolls had perished.
13305,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13306,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""O, Willie, the floor is burned. Hurry, hurry!"" cried Dolly."
13307,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13308,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Willie ran, deluged the burning village, and Dolly seized Susanna and"
13309,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Posy, free from damage, with the exception of Posy's legs, which were"
13310,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"so long, they lay outside the church door, and were burned off. When"
13311,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"they cleared away the ruins, there was a round, black spot on the"
13312,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"floor, where the village had stood, and the children's hands and"
13313,HOLIDAY LUCK.,clothes were wet and grimy.
13314,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13315,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Do you think mother will care?"" asked Dolly, after they had looked"
13316,HOLIDAY LUCK.,solemnly at one another.
13317,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13318,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""I don't believe she will as long as we did not burn any more,"""
13319,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"replied Willie, stepping back on the rest of the matches."
13320,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13321,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"They were explosive, and lighted with a snap that made him jump. When"
13322,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"he saw what he had done, he turned the watering-pot over them, and put"
13323,HOLIDAY LUCK.,his foot on it.
13324,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13325,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Now they are safe,"" he cried. ""Let us bury the pieces of the"
13326,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"village."""
13327,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13328,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""No,"" said Ada. ""After I get a carrot for Blackhawk, let us make a"
13329,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"raft of some of them, and put the rest on, and let them float away on"
13330,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"the brook."""
13331,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13332,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"This was speedily done, and when the little craft had passed the"
13333,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"boundaries of their garden, Willie proposed they should build a dam,"
13334,HOLIDAY LUCK.,and some time he would put up a mill. They were hardly fairly at work
13335,HOLIDAY LUCK.,when Mary called them to dinner.
13336,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13337,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Willie took the head of the table, and was rather offended that Mary"
13338,HOLIDAY LUCK.,did not let him cut the meat.
13339,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13340,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""At any rate, I'll help the pie,"" he declared."
13341,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13342,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Mary prudently cut the pieces before she put it on, and while they"
13343,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"were eating it, Willie very grandly said,--"
13344,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13345,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""You may go now, Mary."""
13346,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13347,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"His mother usually dismissed her at dessert, and Willie wished to have"
13348,HOLIDAY LUCK.,all the privileges of the place he occupied. Mary retired with a
13349,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"smile, and when the first pieces of pie were disposed of, Willie"
13350,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"offered the girls a second. It was mince pie, very nice and tempting;"
13351,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"and though Ada knew a second piece was not generally allowed, she"
13352,HOLIDAY LUCK.,thought a holiday might make a difference. Dolly was busy feeding
13353,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Prig,--a brisk Scotch terrier, with large, bright eyes, stiff, rough"
13354,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"hair, and a tail about two inches long,--and refused."
13355,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13356,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"After dinner they returned to their dam, Ada and Dolly bringing the"
13357,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"material, and Willie building. But Dolly became dissatisfied, and"
13358,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"insisted on being allowed to work in the water, while Ada deserted"
13359,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"altogether, and played with Blackhawk, whom they had let out."
13360,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13361,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Dolly,"" cried Willie, ""won't you go to my room and get my hammer? and"
13362,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"be quick, for I've got to hold this while you are gone."""
13363,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13364,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"The dam was nearly finished, and both were much excited with the"
13365,HOLIDAY LUCK.,success of their work; for the water had collected in quite a pool
13366,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"above, and would soon flow over in a fine fall. Dolly ran, leaving the"
13367,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"doors open behind her. Back she came, and Willie was carefully"
13368,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"adjusting the last beam, when Ada shouted,--"
13369,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13370,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Here's Prig, and Blackhawk's out."""
13371,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13372,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"All three started, calling Prig, and running after her and Blackhawk"
13373,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"in wild confusion. Prig misunderstood their anxiety, and supposing"
13374,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"they were setting her on the rabbit, joined in the hunt. Poor"
13375,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Blackhawk tried to escape, but Prig caught him, gave one shake, and"
13376,HOLIDAY LUCK.,the pretty rabbit lay dead.
13377,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13378,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""O, you wicked dog!"" cried Ada, while Willie and Dolly stood quite"
13379,HOLIDAY LUCK.,overcome by the misfortune.
13380,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13381,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Prig saw in a moment she had made a mistake, and when Willie rushed at"
13382,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"her with uplifted hammer, hid behind the summer-house. With loud grief"
13383,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"and many tears, the children raised their dead pet, and laid it on a"
13384,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"bench in the out-house. Its blue eyes were half open, its soft"
13385,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"black-and-white fur wet and rumpled, and they cried and blamed Prig as"
13386,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"they tenderly arranged it on the bench. Ada fairly howled, and Bridget"
13387,HOLIDAY LUCK.,and Mary ran out to see what was the matter.
13388,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13389,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Ay,"" said Bridget, ""and it was Dolly herself left the door open,"
13390,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"though I told her to shut it."""
13391,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13392,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""I didn't know Prig was there,"" sobbed Dolly."
13393,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13394,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""It's all Prig's fault,"" said Willie, ""and I'll kill her."""
13395,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13396,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""No, no,"" pleaded Dolly, with whom Prig was an especial favorite."
13397,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13398,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"A consultation was held over the bench, and it was finally decided"
13399,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"that the case should be referred to Mrs. Constant on her return,"
13400,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"though Willie still vowed vengeance. Prig had crept back, and crouched"
13401,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"in the doorway; but when the children saw her, they drove her away,"
13402,HOLIDAY LUCK.,throwing stones and calling her the worst names they could invent. She
13403,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"skulked outside very unhappy, until Willie shut her up in the"
13404,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"summer-house, while the children spent the rest of the long afternoon"
13405,HOLIDAY LUCK.,over their dead rabbit. Dolly tied the Princess Widdlesbee's best blue
13406,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"sash about his neck, Willie emptied his toolbox to lay him in, and Ada"
13407,HOLIDAY LUCK.,spread her best doll's bed-quilt over him. Then they sat and cried
13408,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"together until Dolly started up, and said,--"
13409,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13410,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""There's mother."""
13411,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13412,HOLIDAY LUCK.,The first thing Mrs. Constant heard when she entered the house was the
13413,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"cry of,--"
13414,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13415,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Mother, mother!"""
13416,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13417,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Not with the joyous ring it had in the morning, but with an appeal in"
13418,HOLIDAY LUCK.,it which told her some trouble had come which mother could best heal.
13419,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"All told the story separately and together, laying Blackhawk on her"
13420,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"knees, and crying on her shoulder."
13421,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13422,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""And I'm going to hang Prig for a wicked, bad dog,"" said Willie, to"
13423,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"conclude. ""She is a murderer!"" and he fiercely wiped his tears."
13424,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13425,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""My dear little boy, I don't think poor Prig was to blame at all."""
13426,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13427,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""O, mother!"" cried a mournful chorus."
13428,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13429,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""No; Dolly left the door open, you all excited her, and I begin to"
13430,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"think you were having too much of what Willie calls a holiday."""
13431,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13432,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""But it wasn't her holiday, and she's killed Blackhawk. O-o-o!"" and"
13433,HOLIDAY LUCK.,they all cried again.
13434,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13435,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Mrs. Constant soothed them, and sympathized."
13436,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13437,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Don't cry any more. You will be sick. I would not kill Prig, for then"
13438,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"she would be gone too, and to-morrow you would be sorry. And besides,"
13439,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"she was only trying to do as you wanted her to, and following out her"
13440,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"doggish instinct."""
13441,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13442,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"But half convinced, the children went to the summer-house and called"
13443,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Prig; but she would not come. Then they drove her out, and as she"
13444,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"stood trembling before them, reproached her, and raising their arms,"
13445,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"shouted,--"
13446,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13447,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"""Go!"""
13448,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13449,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"Prig hesitated a moment, looked from one to another, then with her"
13450,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"tail between her legs, her hair on end, she uttered an unearthly howl,"
13451,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"and fled at full speed, crowded under the gate, and disappeared."
13452,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13453,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"The children went to bed early, as Mrs. Constant thought the"
13454,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"excitement was bad for them, and in the night she was called to the"
13455,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"little girl's room. Dolly was feverish, and ill with a sore throat,"
13456,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"and Ada in great pain. They were sick all night, and in the morning"
13457,HOLIDAY LUCK.,Mrs. Constant heard about the second piece of pie and Dolly's dam
13458,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"building. Her sleeves had been wet all the afternoon, and the grief,"
13459,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"added to the pie and wet, had made them both ill."
13460,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13461,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"They were not able to go out that day, and Willie buried Blackhawk"
13462,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"alone, while they watched him sadly from the window. They took their"
13463,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"last farewell of their pet at the kitchen door, and would have given"
13464,HOLIDAY LUCK.,all their yesterday's sport to have helped Willie with the funeral. He
13465,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"had meant that Prig should have attended as chief mourner, but she was"
13466,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"nowhere to be found. No one had seen her since her flight, and for"
13467,HOLIDAY LUCK.,days they could find no trace of her. This added to their discomfort;
13468,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"for they all loved her, and Ada and Dolly were confined to the house"
13469,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"for some time, and wanted her to play with them."
13470,HOLIDAY LUCK.,
13471,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"About a week after, on a rainy night, Bridget found her at the kitchen"
13472,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"door, and with great difficulty persuaded her to come in. She was very"
13473,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"thin and unhappy, and hid from the children, when they, already sorry"
13474,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"for their harshness, were kind to her, and tried to play with her. It"
13475,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"was a long time before she was the lively Prig she used to be, and was"
13476,HOLIDAY LUCK.,always a little lame in her left fore foot. Something had hurt her in
13477,HOLIDAY LUCK.,those days of absence; and though after a while the children forgot
13478,HOLIDAY LUCK.,"their holiday and the consequences, I am afraid poor Prig never did."

13521,MONKEYS.,spread over a much larger portion of the earth than at present. They
13522,MONKEYS.,"lived in the south of Europe, in England, and in France. Except a few"

13534,MONKEYS.,
13535,MONKEYS.,"Vosmarin, a Hollander, kept a tamed pongo for a long time. He says,"
13536,MONKEYS.,"""My pongo had rather a sad and downcast look, but was gentle and"
13537,MONKEYS.,"affectionate, and very fond of society, preferring those persons who"
13538,MONKEYS.,"busied themselves about it. Once it seized a bottle of Malaga,"
13539,MONKEYS.,"uncorked it, brought the wine to a secure place, recorked the bottle,"
13540,MONKEYS.,and set it back again. This monkey was very fond of roasted and boiled
13541,MONKEYS.,"meats, and sucked eggs with great delight; however it preferred fruits"
13542,MONKEYS.,"to all other food. After drinking, it was in the habit of wiping its"
13543,MONKEYS.,"mouth with the back of the hand, as men sometimes do, and it generally"
13544,MONKEYS.,"used a toothpick. It made great preparations before going to sleep,"
13545,MONKEYS.,"shaking the hay for its bed, and making a bundle for a pillow; it"
13546,MONKEYS.,covered itself with any cloth or garment it could find.
13547,MONKEYS.,
13548,MONKEYS.,"""Seeing me unlock a door, it observed very attentively, then put a"

13551,MONKEYS.,"induced to touch pussy again. It untied knots easily, and regularly"
13552,MONKEYS.,practised upon the shoes of those who came near. It could lift very
13553,MONKEYS.,"heavy burdens, and made as good use of its hind as of its fore legs;"
13554,MONKEYS.,"for example, if it could not reach a thing with the fore hands, it lay"
13555,MONKEYS.,"on its back, and drew the object with the hind ones. It never cried"

13557,MONKEYS.,"dog, then it became rougher, and at last resembled the noise of a"
13558,MONKEYS.,"wood-saw. It died of consumption."""

13573,MONKEYS.,"board ship, as follows: ""It worked with the sailors, casting anchor,"
13574,MONKEYS.,"reefing sails, &c., and doing its full share of work faithfully. The"
13575,MONKEYS.,"ship's baker depended upon it to heat the oven, which it did with"
13576,MONKEYS.,"wonderful care and exactness, never letting the coals fall, and ever"
13577,MONKEYS.,getting the right heat. It made a peculiar motion to show that the
13578,MONKEYS.,"oven was ready, and the baker, fully confiding in its judgment, was"
13579,MONKEYS.,"not disappointed. The sailors were very fond of it, and treated it as"
13580,MONKEYS.,"a companion; but the pilot, a cruel, heartless man, abused the animal,"
13581,MONKEYS.,"despite its pitiful looks and gestures, as it placed its hand upon its"
13582,MONKEYS.,"heart, and then stretched it towards him, to tell the pain it felt."
13583,MONKEYS.,"However, it did not resent his continued ill-treatment, but refused"
13584,MONKEYS.,to take any nourishment; five days after it died of hunger and a
13585,MONKEYS.,"broken heart. The sailors bemoaned its loss as that of a companion."""
13586,MONKEYS.,
13587,MONKEYS.,"We read of another chimpanzee, which sat at table, ate with knife,"

13595,MONKEYS.,"becomes; losing in its animal, it seems to gain in its spiritual"
13596,MONKEYS.,"nature. It perceives a benefactor in its attending physician, and"
13597,MONKEYS.,thankfully acknowledges his kindness. If it has been relieved by
13598,MONKEYS.,"bleeding, it invariably stretches out its arm at the doctor's"

13706,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,and able to do a great many more things than some city boys of
13707,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"fourteen. He could ride and drive, keep the stable in order, and even"
13708,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"handle a plough. Nor was he a dunce; for, thanks to an evening school,"
13709,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"which some of his Sunday teachers had opened in the village, he had"
13710,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,learned to read and write very fairly. He had a comfortable place at
13711,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"farmer Jolly's; but there was plenty of work to do, and the food was"
13712,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"plain, though he always had enough; so he did not get pudding every"
13713,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"day. No wonder, then, that he should go to bed and dream about that"
13714,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,particular currant-pudding of which I am writing. You must not suppose
13715,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"that this was made with such ""currants"" as are put into a _Christmas_"
13716,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,pudding; they are only small _grapes_. No; it was a real
13717,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"currant-pudding, full of nice red fruit and juice, enough to make your"
13718,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,mouth water.
13719,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13720,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"The long morning's work was at last over, and Harry, nothing loath,"
13721,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"hastened in and took his place at the side table in the kitchen, where"
13722,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"he usually sat. His plate of meat and potatoes was soon cleared, for"
13723,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,the boy's appetite had been sharpened by several hours in the fields.
13724,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13725,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""And now, Harry,"" said Martha, the servant, ""here's your pudding, and"
13726,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"a nice piece it is; but you mustn't be long about it, for John and"
13727,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,Peter will want you back in the field; they have been gone this half
13728,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"hour."" So saying, Martha placed the longed-for treat before Harry, and"
13729,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,went out to attend to some work in the farm-yard.
13730,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13731,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"Just at that moment a wasp, who had grown tired of buzzing about the"
13732,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"peaches in the garden, and trying in vain to get at them (for Peter"
13733,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"had covered them with network), peeped in at the window with one of"
13734,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"his many eyes, and, spying Master Harry's pudding, thought, I suppose,"
13735,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"that he should like a share. So, without waiting to be invited, he"
13736,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"flew in with a loud hum, and made straight for the table, just as"
13737,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,Harry had stuck his fork into the first piece of crust.
13738,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13739,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"Now, our farmer's boy, though he liked pudding, did not like wasps,"
13740,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,which he fancied were always ready to sting; and being himself rather
13741,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"hasty in temper, he at once declared war against the little intruder."
13742,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"First he hit at it with his knife, but without success; and then with"
13743,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"his fork, but only with this result--that the pudding, instead of"
13744,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"going into Harry's mouth, flew under the grate among the ashes, while"
13745,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,the wasp seemed to be humming a song of defiance.
13746,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13747,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"Harry grew red in the face, and vowed vengeance against ""the nasty"
13748,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"thing;"" but ""the nasty thing"" would not come and be killed. Seizing a"
13749,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"large wooden pudding spoon, which lay close at hand, Harry jumped on"
13750,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,one of the wooden chairs and aimed a desperate blow at the poor
13751,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"insect. But Yellow-band was too sharp for him, and Harry, losing his"
13752,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"balance, fell down with a thump on the sanded floor, while his weapon,"
13753,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"spinning across the kitchen, came in contact with one of Mrs. Jolly's"
13754,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"basins, and brought it down with a crash. In rushed Martha in a"
13755,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"fright, and, worse still, farmer Jolly's round, good-natured face"
13756,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,appeared close behind.
13757,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13758,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""Bless the boy,"" cried Martha, ""what have you been up to now?"""
13759,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13760,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""Why--why,"" said Harry, rubbing his shoulder and looking ruefully at"
13761,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"the broken china, ""it was all that horrid wasp."""
13762,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13763,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""And why couldn't you leave the wasp alone?"" retorted Martha, angrily,"
13764,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,as she picked up some of the pieces.
13765,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13766,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""Ay, boy,"" said farmer Jolly, ""why couldn't you leave the wasp alone,"
13767,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"eh? Why couldn't you leave it alone?"" he repeated, catching Harry by"
13768,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,the arm with a grip that made him wince.
13769,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13770,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""Please, sir--please, sir,"" stammered the boy, ""I thought the"
13771,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"nasty--the wasp I mean--was going to sting me."""
13772,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13773,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""Stuff and nonsense,"" replied the farmer; ""if you don't interfere with"
13774,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"the wasps, the wasps won't interfere with you. How often have I told"
13775,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,you that _it takes two to make a quarrel_? Now you have wasted your
13776,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"time, spoiled your dinner, and done mischief; so you had better be off"
13777,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"to your work, and Martha will put the pudding away till to-morrow."""
13778,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13779,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"Harry hastened out, looking very foolish, and feeling very much"
13780,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"disappointed. ""I wish I'd left the wasp alone,"" he said to himself;"
13781,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"""then I shouldn't have lost the pudding. The farmer says, 'It takes"

13783,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"quarrel at all, unless we like. I'll think about that, so I will."" And"
13784,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"so he did; and when he felt inclined to quarrel, not only with wasps,"
13785,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"but with boys, he checked himself by calling to mind farmer Jolly's"

13787,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,
13788,A STORY FOR OUR YOUNGEST READERS.,"And I am of opinion that, if the boys and girls who read this story"

13802,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"Field-marshal Alexander Suvaroff, the commander-in-chief of the"
13803,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"Russian army during the reigns of Catharine II. and Paul I., was"
13804,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"especially fond of mixing with the common soldiers, and sharing in"
13805,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"their sports and conversations, being always highly delighted when his"
13806,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"men failed to discover him; and this happened pretty often, for,"
13807,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"thanks to his small stature and ugly face, as well as the extreme"
13808,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"plainness of his dress, the great marshal looked as little like a"
13809,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,general as any man could do. In this way he got to understand
13810,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"thoroughly the character of his soldiers, and had a greater power over"
13811,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,them than any Russian general before or after him. His marvellous
13812,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"power of enduring fatigue, his insensibility to heat, cold, or hunger,"
13813,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,and his untiring energy on the field of battle (in all which points he
13814,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"surpassed the hardiest of his grenadiers), made him the idol of the"
13815,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,rough soldiers whom he commanded; and a word of reproof from Father
13816,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"Alexander Vasilievitch, as his men affectionately called him, was more"
13817,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,dreaded than the fire of a battery.
13818,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13819,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"Before one of his Italian campaigns, Suvaroff gathered together a"
13820,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"number of his best men, and made them one of the short pithy speeches"
13821,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"for which he was famous, and some of which are remembered among the"
13822,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,peasantry to this day:--
13823,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13824,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""My children, we are going to fight the French. Remember, whatever you"
13825,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"meet, _you must go forward_. If the enemy resist, kill them; but if"
13826,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"they yield, spare them; and always remember that a Russian soldier is"
13827,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"not a robber, but a Christian. Now, go and tell your comrades what I"
13828,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"have said!"""
13829,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13830,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"A few days later a great battle took place, in which the day went"
13831,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"against the French, who began to retreat about sunset; and a soldier"
13832,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"named Ivan Mitrophanoff, who had distinguished himself by his bravery"
13833,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"throughout the whole day, captured, with the help of a comrade who was"
13834,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"with him, a French officer and two of his men. Mitrophanoff bound up"
13835,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"the officer's wounded arm, and seeing that the prisoners appeared"
13836,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"faint from want of food, shared with them the coarse rye loaf which"
13837,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"was to have served him for supper. He had scarcely done so, when up"
13838,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"came three or four Russian grenadiers, hot with fighting, and raising"
13839,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,furious cries.
13840,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13841,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""What,"" cried they, ""three of these French dogs living yet!"" and they"
13842,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,ran upon the prisoners with levelled bayonets.
13843,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13844,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""Hold, my lads!"" cried Mitrophanoff. ""I've given them their lives, and"
13845,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"no one must touch them now!"""
13846,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13847,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"But the soldiers would not listen to him, and were rushing forward,"
13848,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"when a stern voice from behind shouted, ""Halt!"" and a little,"
13849,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"pugnosed, dirty-faced man, dressed only in a coarse linen shirt and a"
13850,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"pair of tattered gray trousers, stepped into the circle. But, ragged"
13851,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"and dirty as he was, the fierce soldiers could not have looked more"
13852,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,frightened had he been a giant in full armor.
13853,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13854,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""The general!"" muttered they, slinking off."
13855,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13856,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""Ay, the general!"" roared Suvaroff, ""who will have some of you shot"
13857,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"presently, if you can't learn to obey orders better! And you,"" he"
13858,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"added, turning to Mitrophanoff, ""who taught you to be so good?"""
13859,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13860,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""Your highness' own self taught me,"" answered the grenadier. ""I"

13863,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,
13864,A GOOD WORD NOT LOST.,"""Right!"" exclaimed Suvaroff, with a brightening face. ""A good word is"

13878,PONTO.,Our dog Ponto is a knowing old fellow. It is as good as a show to
13879,PONTO.,watch him sometimes. He has one quality that most of us might seek
13880,PONTO.,"after with advantage--that is, a will to overcome difficulties that"
13881,PONTO.,scarcely anything can hinder. If Ponto takes it into his head to do
13882,PONTO.,"anything, he is pretty sure to succeed. What helps his dogship is the"
13883,PONTO.,"faculty of imitation. He is like a monkey in this, only a great deal"
13884,PONTO.,more sensible than any monkey I ever heard tell of. You never catch
13885,PONTO.,"him venturing upon unknown danger, or making himself ridiculous,"
13886,PONTO.,because his human friends and companions choose to step aside from the
13887,PONTO.,ways of safety and respectability.
13888,PONTO.,
13889,PONTO.,"One day, a few years ago, Ponto was missing. He had been about as"
13890,PONTO.,"usual during the morning, but all at once disappeared. A neighbor told"
13891,PONTO.,"us that he had seen him fighting with the butcher's dog about noon,"
13892,PONTO.,and that he was getting the worst of it. I went over to the butcher's
13893,PONTO.,"during the afternoon, and the butcher's boy confirmed the neighbor's"
13894,PONTO.,"story. Ponto had come over there for a fight, as the boy said, and"
13895,PONTO.,"""got more than he bargained for."""
13896,PONTO.,
13897,PONTO.,"""He'll not try it again very soon, I'm thinking,"" added the boy, with"
13898,PONTO.,a malicious pleasure.
13899,PONTO.,
13900,PONTO.,"""Do you know where he is now?"" I asked."
13901,PONTO.,
13902,PONTO.,"""Home, I suppose. He went off that way, limping,"" answered the boy."
13903,PONTO.,
13904,PONTO.,"""Was he much hurt?"""
13905,PONTO.,
13906,PONTO.,"""Considerable, I guess."""
13907,PONTO.,
13908,PONTO.,"I went back home, but no one had seen Ponto. I was beginning to feel"
13909,PONTO.,"anxious about the dog, when he was found in one of the third-story"
13910,PONTO.,"rooms, snugly covered up in bed, with his head on the pillow. On"
13911,PONTO.,turning down the clothes a sight met our eyes. The sheets were all
13912,PONTO.,"stained with blood, and the poor dog, hurt and exhausted, looked as"
13913,PONTO.,helpless and pitiful as any human being.
13914,PONTO.,
13915,PONTO.,[Illustration: PONTO.]
13916,PONTO.,
13917,PONTO.,I will not tell you of all the wounds he had received. There were a
13918,PONTO.,"great many of them, and some quite severe. ""A good lesson for him,"" we"
13919,PONTO.,"all said. And it proved so, for he was a little more careful after"
13920,PONTO.,that how he got into a fight.
13921,PONTO.,
13922,PONTO.,"A few months before, I had been thrown from a wagon and badly hurt--so"
13923,PONTO.,much so that I was confined to bed for a week. Ponto was with me at
13924,PONTO.,"the time of the accident, and on my arrival at home followed me into"
13925,PONTO.,the house and up to the chamber where I was taken. He watched every
13926,PONTO.,"movement as I was laid in bed, and then sat down with his eyes on my"
13927,PONTO.,"pale face, regarding me with such looks of pity and interest that I"
13928,PONTO.,was touched and surprised.
13929,PONTO.,
13930,PONTO.,"When Ponto's turn came, he remembered the comfortable way in which I"
13931,PONTO.,"had been cared for, and profited by what he had seen. But his"
13932,PONTO.,"mistress, while she pitied the poor animal, did not fancy having her"
13933,PONTO.,spare bedroom turned into a dog-hospital; and so we removed him to an
13934,PONTO.,out-house and made him as comfortable there as possible.
13935,PONTO.,
13936,PONTO.,One cold winter evening Ponto was absent from his accustomed place in
13937,PONTO.,"the hall, where he slept on a mat. The wind was high and there was a"
13938,PONTO.,confusion of sounds outside.
13939,PONTO.,
13940,PONTO.,"""Hark!"" said one."
13941,PONTO.,
13942,PONTO.,We all listened.
13943,PONTO.,
13944,PONTO.,"""I thought I heard a knock at the hall door."""
13945,PONTO.,
13946,PONTO.,"""Only the wind,"" was replied."
13947,PONTO.,
13948,PONTO.,"""Yes; there it is again."""
13949,PONTO.,
13950,PONTO.,"We all heard two distinct knocks, given quickly one after the other."
13951,PONTO.,
13952,PONTO.,"I arose, and going into the hall went to the front door and opened it."
13953,PONTO.,"As I did so Ponto bounded in past me, gave two or three short, glad"
13954,PONTO.,"barks, and then paid his boisterous respects to the family in the"
13955,PONTO.,"sitting-room. I waited a moment, and then stepped out to see who had"
13956,PONTO.,"lifted the knocker, but found no one. Ponto had done it himself, as we"
13957,PONTO.,had proof enough afterward; for ever since that time he has used the
13958,PONTO.,knocker as regularly as any two-legged member of the family.

14004,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,a catamount should take it into his head to drop down upon me from a
14005,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"tree-top, or a big black bear to step out from behind one of those low"
14006,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"hemlocks, or even a cross old ""lucivee"" to rush out from some of those"
14007,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,thick cedar clumps. For thoughts of these things had begun to pop into
14008,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"my mind. I was but seventeen then, and hadn't quite outgrown my fear"
14009,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"of the dark. And thus plodding timorously onward, thinking on many"
14010,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"things injurious to a boy's courage, I had begun to think I should"
14011,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"have to make a night of it there, somewhere, when the red gleam of a"
14012,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"fire, from the crest of the ridge before me, suddenly burst out on the"
14013,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"darkness, banishing all my fears. For a fire, whether in a hunter's"
14014,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"camp or a farm-house window, is good evidence of man's presence, with"
14015,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,food and shelter--the two great wants of the belated.

14024,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,

14064,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"I did so without further invitation, and never made a better supper,"

14072,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,was truly a wild scene. Clouds of steam gushed up from the surging
14073,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"kettles; and the fires gleamed brighter as the darkness deepened,"
14074,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,while all about us seemed a wall of blackness. But my long tramp had
14075,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"thoroughly tired me down, and my recollections of the remainder of the"

14077,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the names of the two youthful sugar-makers, upon whose camp I had"
14078,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"stumbled, were Zeke Murch and Sam Bubar; and I also helped to take off"
14079,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"a large kettle of hot sirup, which we set in a snow-drift, two or"
14080,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"three rods from the fire, to cool. This done, I was soon asleep,"
14081,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"rolled up in an old coverlet, and knew very little till, hearing"
14082,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"voices, I opened my eyes to the fact that the sun was staring me in"

14084,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14085,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"Hastily unrolling myself, I saw Sam and Zeke out at the kettle we had"

14097,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14098,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"The kettle, which must have held several pailfuls, was nearly empty;"
14099,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,and what was left hadn't a very inviting look certainly.

14121,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14122,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""And I'm mad, too,"" continued Zeke. ""We were depending on this kittle"
14123,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"of sirup for our party to-night."""
14124,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14125,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Your party?"""
14126,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14127,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Yes; we've invited a lot of the boys--and girls, too--to come up here"
14128,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"this evening, to make 'sheep-skins.' You'll stay--won't you? We were"
14129,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"going to ask you."""
14130,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14131,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Don't know,"" said I, still thinking of the bear."
14132,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14133,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""O, I don't think he'll meddle with us,"" said Sam, guessing at my"
14134,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"hesitation. ""I'm going down to get some _fixins_, and shall bring up a"
14135,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"gun. If he calls again, he may get a dose of buckshot."""
14136,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14137,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,No one is apt to be a great coward after the sun is up. Thus
14138,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"reassured, I concluded to stop to the party, for which the boys were"
14139,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,intending to make a great preparation.
14140,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14141,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Let's do the thing up in style now,"" said Sam."
14142,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14143,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"We went at it. First we cut low, shrubby evergreens, hemlocks mostly,"
14144,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"and with these made a sort of enclosure, some four rods in diameter,"
14145,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"around the kettles, by planting them in the snow. Then clipping off an"
14146,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"immense quantity of smaller boughs, we strewed the snow inside the"
14147,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,enclosure with these. We thus had a sort of green room (without any
14148,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"roof), in the centre of which steamed the boiling kettles; and at the"
14149,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"entrance, or doorway, we made a grand arch of cedar. For seats we"
14150,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"rolled in ""four-foot"" cuts from the trunk of a large poplar they had"
14151,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"lately felled, first splitting off a slab from the side of each to"
14152,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"form a seat, which we cushioned with cedar."
14153,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14154,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,Meanwhile another kettle of sirup was boiling down to supply the place
14155,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,of that the bear had drank; and filling some fifteen or twenty
14156,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"sap-buckets with clean snow, crowded down hard to make the"
14157,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""sheep-skins"" on, we were ready for our company."
14158,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14159,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,It was nearly night before all this had been completed. Sam had been
14160,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"down to the ""settlement"" and brought up a quantity of bread to go with"
14161,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,our honey; and I was glad to see that he hadn't forgotten the gun;
14162,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"for, as night began to close in again, I couldn't help remembering the"
14163,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,great tracks out there in the snow-drift. As it grew dark and the fire
14164,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"began to shine on the green boughs, our scenery looked even better"
14165,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"than by daylight; and for beacons to our incoming guests, we fixed"
14166,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,torches of pitch-wood upon stakes thrust into the snow around our
14167,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"camp, and at several points out in the woods, like lamp-posts in a"
14168,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,town.
14169,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14170,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Quite a show,"" said Sam, surveying the preparation. ""How changed and"
14171,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"odd it makes it look all about!"""
14172,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14173,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"Ere long voices began to be heard coming up through the woods,--merry"
14174,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"shouts and hails,--to which the boys responded, bidding them hurry,"
14175,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"and promising a big ""sheep-skin"" to the one who first got up there."
14176,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14177,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,A chorus of merry cries and laughter followed this announcement; and
14178,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"in a few moments a racing, panting crowd of a dozen boys and girls"
14179,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"came up in sight, and poured under the arch--sturdy lads, and lasses"
14180,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,in red frocks and checked aprons. And here be it said that a girl--a
14181,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,certain rosy Nell Ridley--won the sheep-skin by being the first under
14182,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the archway. But the others were not far behind, and in another moment"
14183,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,our green arena was swarming with the young folks.
14184,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14185,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"Though a stranger, I soon found myself acquainted and on the best of"
14186,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"terms with everybody. Sheep-skins were now being run by the dozen, the"
14187,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"process being to pour hot sirup upon the cold, hard-pressed snow in"
14188,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the buckets, where it instantly cooled, becoming tough and of the"
14189,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"color of sheep-skin. And if one has a ""sweet tooth,"" nothing among all"
14190,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the ""sugars"" can compare with a maple sheep-skin."
14191,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14192,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"We all had _sweet teeth_ there, and were in the midst of a furious"
14193,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"romp around the kettles in chase of Nell, whom some one had accused of"
14194,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"appropriating ""the great one,"" when somebody suddenly cried,--"
14195,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14196,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Hark!"""
14197,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14198,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,There was an instant hush; when clear on the evening air there came a
14199,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"wild cry--a long, quavering ""Hoo-oo-oo."""
14200,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14201,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""Bear! A bear!"" exclaimed several of the boys, to whom bruin's nightly"
14202,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,cries were but familiar sounds. But save that a few of the girls
14203,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"looked a little startled, no one seemed to be much alarmed. I saw Zeke"
14204,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"looking to the priming of the old gun, though; and for a while we were"
14205,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"pretty whist, listening; but the cry, which had seemed at a"
14206,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"considerable distance, was not repeated. Indeed, in the merriment"
14207,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"which soon succeeded, the most of us had entirely forgotten it, I"
14208,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,think. At least we were all in the midst of another scrimmage over the
14209,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"""last biscuit,"" when a loud snort, like that of a startled horse, a"
14210,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"sort of ""woof! woof!"" accompanied by a great rustling in our evergreen"
14211,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"hedge, startled us; and turning, we saw--I shall never forget the"
14212,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"sight--an enormous black creature coming through our _fence_, with all"
14213,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the independence of a sole proprietor! Of course, as Zeke afterwards"
14214,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"expressed it, ""if _he_ was _coming in_, we wanted to _go out_."""
14215,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14216,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"The girls were not of the fainting sort; but they did scream some, and"
14217,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,we all sprang away like cats through the opposite side of the hedge.
14218,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,The gun had been left standing near the place where the bear had
14219,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"broken in, and was not to be got at, of course. But, catching out my"
14220,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"pistol, as we scrambled through the hemlock, I discharged it at the"
14221,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"old fellow, hitting him, I guess; for he growled and came straight"
14222,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,after me. 'Twas no time to be loitering. Down the slope we all ran
14223,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"together, slumping and sprawling full length in the soft snow! Up and"
14224,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"on again, knocking out spiles and kicking over sap-buckets, bumping"
14225,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,and grazing ourselves against the rough bark of the maples; for it was
14226,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"pitch dark in the woods. But on we went for dear life, expecting every"
14227,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,moment to feel the bear's teeth or claws from behind. At first I had a
14228,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,sort of impression that we boys should have to wait and put ourselves
14229,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,between the girls and the bear; but I soon found I had all I could do
14230,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,to keep up with them. Such girls to run I never saw before! And we
14231,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"never stopped till, at a distance of a mile below, the forest opened"
14232,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,out into a cleared field.
14233,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14234,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"There we began to discover that the bear was not after us, and"
14235,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"gradually came to a halt. After getting breath, however, we kept"
14236,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"on--at a little slower pace, though--down to the ""corners,"" where,"
14237,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"after seeing the girls to their respective dwellings, guns were"
14238,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"procured, and, rallying out Mr. Bubar and Mr. Murch, senior, with"
14239,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"several other men, we all started back to hunt up the bear. Going"
14240,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"quietly up through the woods, we cautiously approached to a point"
14241,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,where the gap we had made in rushing out of our enclosure enabled us
14242,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,to see what was going on inside; and there by the firelight we beheld
14243,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"the bear sitting cosily before the coals, and gazing wistfully into"
14244,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,the boiling kettles. He had probably found them too hot for his use.
14245,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,
14246,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"Raising their guns, the men all fired together--a murderous volley of"
14247,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"bullets and buckshot. Rearing upon his haunches with a sullen growl,"
14248,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"old bruin glared around a moment, then fell over backwards, and, with"
14249,BRUIN AT A MAPLE-SUGAR PARTY.,"a few dying kicks and groans, was dead. And this was the end of Bruin"

14259,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14260,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,There is not the least difficulty in distinguishing the Asiatic from
14261,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"the African elephant. The ears of the former are comparatively small,"
14262,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"only reaching a little below the eyes, while the ears of the African"
14263,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"species are of enormous dimensions, actually crossing on the back of"
14264,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"the neck, drooping far below the chin, and extending beyond the"
14265,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"shoulder-blade. Generally, the ears are laid so flatly against the"
14266,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"neck, that they seem almost to form part of the skin of the head and"
14267,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"shoulders; but when the creature is suddenly roused, the ears are"
14268,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"thrown forward, and stand out so boldly, that they look more like"
14269,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,wings than ears. Towards the lower part the ears form themselves into
14270,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"slight folds, which are not without some degree of elegance."
14271,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14272,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,The end of the trunk also differs from that of the Asiatic species. In
14273,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,that animal a kind of finger projects from the upper part of the
14274,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,extremity; but in the African species the end of the trunk is split so
14275,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"far, that the two lobes act as opposable fingers, and serve to grasp"
14276,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,any object which the animal desires to hold. This structure can easily
14277,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"be seen by offering the animal a piece of biscuit. The forehead, too,"
14278,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"affords another means of distinction, being convex in the African, and"
14279,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,flat or slightly concave in the Asiatic.
14280,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14281,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,Another very decided difference lies in the teeth. These enormous
14282,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,engines of mastication are made up of a number of flat plates laid
14283,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"side by side, and composed of enamel and bone. In the Asiatic species"
14284,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"these plates are nearly oval in form, and may be imitated by taking a"
14285,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"piece of cardboard, rolling it into a tube, and then pressing it until"
14286,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,it is nearly flat. But in the African species these plates are of a
14287,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"diamond shape, and may be rudely imitated by taking the same"
14288,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"cardboard tube, and squeezing it nearly flat at each end, leaving the"
14289,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"centre to project. In consequence of these distinctions, several"
14290,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,systematic zoölogists have thought that the African elephant ought to
14291,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"be placed in a separate genus, and have therefore called it _Loxodonta"
14292,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"Africana_, the former of these words signifying ""oblique-toothed."" I"
14293,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"think, however, that there are no real grounds for such a change, and"
14294,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,that the genus Elephas is amply sufficient for both species.
14295,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14296,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,The enormous ears of the African elephant are not without their use to
14297,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"the hunter, who finds in them an invaluable aid in repairing damages"
14298,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"to his wagons and guns. Even if a gun-stock be smashed,--an accident"
14299,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"which is of no very unfrequent occurrence in South African hunting,--a"
14300,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"large piece of elephant's ear, put on while fresh and wet, and allowed"
14301,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"to dry in the sun, sets matters right again, and binds the fragments"
14302,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,together as if they were enclosed in iron. Sometimes the ear seems to
14303,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"be a protection to the animal; for it is so tough and strong, despite"
14304,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"its pliability, that the hunter will occasionally find several bullets"
14305,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"lodged in the ear, which have not been able to penetrate through a"
14306,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,substance at once tough and flexible.
14307,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14308,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"This species is of a thirsty nature, so that wherever elephant paths"
14309,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"are seen, the hunter knows that he is not very far from water of some"
14310,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"kind. And as elephants have a fashion of travelling in Indian file, it"
14311,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"is easy enough to trace their footsteps, and so to find the water. The"
14312,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"animals go to drink in the evening, as do many other wild beasts, and"
14313,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,the quantity which they consume is enormous. They go close to the
14314,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"water's edge, insert the end of the trunk into the liquid, draw it up"
14315,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"until the two nostril-tubes are full, turn the end of the trunk into"
14316,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"the mouth, and then discharge the contents into the stomach. When"
14317,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"satiated, they amuse themselves for a while by blowing water all over"
14318,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"their bodies, and then retrace their steps to the forest glades whence"
14319,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,they came.
14320,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14321,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,The enormous quantity of water which they carry home within them has a
14322,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"rather curious effect. At tolerably regular intervals a loud, rumbling"
14323,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"sound is heard, much resembling the ""glug-glug"" produced by pouring"
14324,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"wine out of a bottle, and lasting a few seconds. Were it not for this"
14325,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"phenomenon, the hunters would meet with far less success than at"
14326,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"present is the case. When hiding from a foe, the elephant can remain"
14327,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"motionless, so that not a cracking stick nor a rustling leaf betrays"
14328,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,its presence. But it cannot prevent this periodical rumbling; and
14329,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"accordingly, when a hunter is in the bush after elephants, he sits"
14330,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"down every few minutes, and waits, in order to catch the sound which"
14331,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,tells him that elephants are near. Even in the semi-domesticated
14332,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"specimens at the London Zoölogical Gardens, this sound is easily to be"
14333,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,heard.
14334,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14335,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"The African elephant is more hunted than the Asiatic species, and"
14336,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,affords better sport and greater profit to the hunter. It seems to be
14337,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"a fiercer, more active, and probably a more cunning animal, and, owing"
14338,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"to the character of the country through which it ranges, it seems to"
14339,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,be of a more nomad disposition. The chase of the African elephant
14340,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"appears to exercise a kind of fascination over its votaries, like the"
14341,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,chase of the chamois among the Swiss mountaineers; and when a hunter
14342,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"has fairly settled down to the business, he cannot tear himself away"
14343,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,from it without exercising great self-denial. Perhaps few sports are
14344,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"encompassed with greater difficulties and dangers, or involve greater"
14345,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"hardships; and yet the wild, free, roving life has such charms, that"
14346,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,even a highly-educated European can scarcely make up his mind to
14347,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,return to civilization.
14348,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14349,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"In the first place, elephant hunting is not, as are many sports, an"
14350,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"expensive amusement. On the contrary, a hunter who possesses a"
14351,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"sufficiency of skill, courage, and endurance will be able not only to"
14352,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"cover his expenses, but to pay himself handsomely for his trouble."
14353,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,There is certainly a very large expenditure at the outset; for a
14354,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"hunter will need two wagons, with a whole drove of oxen, several good"
14355,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"and seasoned horses, a small arsenal of guns, with ammunition to"
14356,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"match, provisions for a lengthened period, and plenty of beads and"
14357,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"other articles which can be bartered for ivory. Moreover, a number of"
14358,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"native servants must be kept, and the amount of meat which they"
14359,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,consume daily is almost appalling.
14360,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14361,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,Then there are always great losses to be counted upon. The cattle get
14362,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"among the dread Tzetse flies, and die off in a few hours; the horses"
14363,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"catch the ""paardsikte"" (a kind of murrain), or tumble into pitfalls;"
14364,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"wagons break down, servants run away with guns, native chiefs detain"
14365,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"the wagons for weeks, together with a host of minor drawbacks. Still,"
14366,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"if a man is worthy of the name of hunter, and boldly faces these"
14367,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"difficulties, he will pay himself well, provided that his health holds"
14368,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,out--there are so many valuable articles to be brought from Southern
14369,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"Africa, such as the horns and furs of animals, the skins of birds,"
14370,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"ostrich feathers, and ivory."
14371,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14372,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"The teeth of the elephant, too, are valuable, and are made into"
14373,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,various articles of use and ornament. A set of knife-handles made of
14374,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"elephant's tooth is sometimes to be seen, and I have now before me an"
14375,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"excellent specimen of a knife-handle, which shows the alternate rows"
14376,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"of enamel and bone in a very striking manner, and is certainly a much"
14377,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,handsomer article than a handle made of simple ivory.
14378,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14379,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,[Illustration: THE ELEPHANT.]
14380,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14381,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"The elephant is, indeed, one of the most eccentric of animals. There"
14382,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"is no possibility of calculating upon it, and nothing but experience"
14383,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,can serve a hunter when measuring his own intellect against the
14384,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,elephant's cunning. The scent or sight of a human being at the
14385,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,distance of a mile will send a herd of powerful male elephants on
14386,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"their travels, the huge creatures preferring to travel for many miles"
14387,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"rather than meet a man. Yet, when assailed, there is scarcely any"
14388,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"animal which is more to be dreaded. It forgets fear, and, filled with"
14389,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"blind rage, it will chase an armed man in spite of his rifle, and will"
14390,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,continue to charge him until it dies.
14391,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14392,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"It will engage in deadly battle with its own species, or with the"
14393,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"mail-clad rhinoceros, and yet will run away at the barking of a little"
14394,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"dog. There was a curious instance some years ago, when an elephant"
14395,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"that was travelling in America went mad, escaped from its keeper"
14396,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"during the night, and traversed the country for miles, doing great"
14397,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"damage. It broke carts to pieces, killed the horses, and was trying to"
14398,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"force its way into a barn where another horse had taken refuge, when"
14399,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"it was checked by a bull-dog, which flew at the huge animal, bit its"
14400,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"legs, and worried it so thoroughly, that the elephant, mad as it was,"
14401,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"fairly ran away. Indeed, nothing seems to cast this gigantic animal"
14402,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"into such a state of perplexity as the noisy attacks of a little,"
14403,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"cross-tempered, insolent, yapping terrier. The elephant cannot"
14404,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"understand it, and gets into such a state of nervous irritation, that"
14405,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"it never thinks of running away or annihilating its diminutive foe,"
14406,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"but remains near the same spot, making short and ineffectual charges,"
14407,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,until the hunter comes up and deliberately chooses his own position
14408,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,for attack.
14409,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14410,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"The flesh of the elephant is anything but palatable, and when cut into"
14411,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"strips and dried in the sun, has been aptly compared to leather"
14412,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,straps. A well-known hunter said that the character of elephant's
14413,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,flesh might easily be imagined by taking the toughest beefsteak ever
14414,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"cooked, multiplying the toughness by four, and subtracting all the"
14415,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"gravy. The natives, however, are possessed of marvellously strong jaws"
14416,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"and sharp teeth, and to them meat is meat, whether tough or tender."
14417,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"There are, however, several parts of the elephant which are always"
14418,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"good; and these are the heart, the feet, and the trunk. The heart and"
14419,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"trunk are simply roasted, with the addition of some of the fat from"
14420,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,the interior of the body; but the feet require a more elaborate mode
14421,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,of cookery.
14422,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,
14423,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"While some of the men are cutting off the feet, others are employed in"
14424,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,digging a circular hole in the ground some ten feet deep and three
14425,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"wide, the earth being heaped round the edge. An enormous heap of dry"
14426,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"wood and leaves is then piled over the hole, set on fire, and allowed"
14427,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,to burn itself out. As soon as the last sticks have fallen into the
14428,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"hole, the men begin to rake out the glowing embers with long poles."
14429,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"This is a laborious and difficult task, the heat being so great, that"
14430,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"each man can only work for a few consecutive seconds, and then gives"
14431,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"way to a cooler comrade. However, there are plenty of laborers, and"
14432,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,the hole is soon cleared. The elephant's foot is then rolled into the
14433,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"hole, and covered over with the earth that was heaped round the edge."
14434,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"Another pile of wood is then raised, and when it has completely burned"
14435,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"out, the foot is supposed to be properly baked. Thus prepared, the"
14436,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,foot is thought to be almost the greatest luxury which South Africa
14437,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"can afford, the whole interior being dissolved into a soft, gelatinous"
14438,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,substance of a most delicate flavor. There is never any lack of fuel;
14439,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"for the elephants break down so many branches for food, and in their"
14440,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,"passage through the bush, that abundance of dry boughs can always be"
14441,THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT.,picked up within a limited area.

14450,I.,
14451,I.,"In those unhappy days when revolution prevailed in France, there were"
14452,I.,a number of noble families who were reduced to extreme poverty. One of
14453,I.,"these was the family of Duke Erlan, who was a noble and"
14454,I.,"highly-respected man, while his wife was kind and charitable to such"
14455,I.,an extent that all the poor people in the surrounding country loved
14456,I.,her with great affection.
14457,I.,
14458,I.,They had two children--Carl and Lillie. When a certain revolutionary
14459,I.,"outbreak had occurred, the duke removed from the city where he lived"
14460,I.,"to his chateau, in a retired part of the country, where he was"
14461,I.,"surrounded by rocks, vineyards, and fields of grain, far removed from"
14462,I.,the bustle and turmoil of city life.
14463,I.,
14464,I.,The good man regarded himself as very fortunate in being permitted to
14465,I.,"live here in quiet with his family, and become the teacher of his"
14466,I.,children.
14467,I.,
14468,I.,"Notwithstanding the great danger prevailing in the country, this was"
14469,I.,indeed a happy family.
14470,I.,
14471,I.,"The duke was a good musician, and he made it an object to teach his"
14472,I.,"children to play on the piano; and though they were quite young, both"
14473,I.,of them knew a number of very beautiful tunes.
14474,I.,
14475,I.,"On one stormy evening, near the end of winter, all four of them sat"
14476,I.,together near their splendid piano. The duke had composed a little
14477,I.,"song for his two children. It was such a pleasant, lively melody, that"
14478,I.,"they had learned it very easily, and each of them could play it. Their"
14479,I.,"mother, however, did not know it, and the children now thought it a"
14480,I.,great thing for them to have the privilege of teaching it to her.
14481,I.,
14482,I.,"""Carl,"" said the duke, ""you play, and we will sing."""
14483,I.,
14484,I.,And they sang this song:--
14485,I.,
14486,I.,"""Take courage, bird;"
14487,I.,"Our Father says,"
14488,I.,In winter's storms
14489,I.,And summer's rays
14490,I.,"You have no barns,"
14491,I.,"You sow no wheat,"
14492,I.,"But God will give you bread to eat."""
14493,I.,
14494,I.,"While they were singing, they heard some one knock at the door. They"
14495,I.,"heard the bell ring, and when the door was opened, five soldiers, clad"
14496,I.,"in uniform, demanded Duke Erlan to deliver himself up. They walked"
14497,I.,"straight up to him, and told him that he must go immediately to"
14498,I.,"prison. His wife cast herself at their feet, and begged them to let"
14499,I.,him live in peace.
14500,I.,
14501,I.,"""We cannot help it,"" said they. ""We have our orders, and must obey"
14502,I.,"them."""
14503,I.,
14504,I.,Not five minutes elapsed before that good man was taken from the midst
14505,I.,"of his happy family, and hurried to prison. The duchess and her son"
14506,I.,and daughter were overwhelmed with sorrow. They could not sleep that
14507,I.,"night, and the next morning, as they looked out of the window and saw"
14508,I.,"how the storm had prevailed in the vineyards and on the fields, they"
14509,I.,felt that the storm in their own hearts had been far more destructive.
14510,I.,
14511,I.,The unhappy duchess now determined to use every means to rescue her
14512,I.,beloved husband. She went to the judges and assured them of her
14513,I.,husband's innocence; but they did not seem to have any more feeling
14514,I.,"than so many marble statues. She received, in reply to her entreaties,"
14515,I.,this answer:--
14516,I.,
14517,I.,"""In a few days your husband will be beheaded."""
14518,I.,
14519,I.,"She returned to the castle after three days, and found that it was"
14520,I.,"occupied by soldiers. The furniture had all been taken away, and the"
14521,I.,treasures were missing. She was not permitted even to enter the
14522,I.,"castle, and was informed that her children, for whom she was weeping"
14523,I.,"in great sorrow, were gone--nobody could tell where."
14524,I.,
14525,I.,"It was late at night, and she did not know where she would sleep."
14526,I.,"Going out into the castle-yard, she was met by Richard, an old and"
14527,I.,"faithful servant, who said,--"
14528,I.,
14529,I.,"""Good mistress, you are in danger every moment of being arrested."
14530,I.,There is no safety for you unless you flee as quickly as possible. I
14531,I.,"cannot conceal you, for that would be dangerous for all. I cannot save"
14532,I.,"your husband, and if you stay here it will be certain death. Your"
14533,I.,"children are at my house. Come with me. My brother, the old fisherman,"
14534,I.,"who keeps the ferry at the Rhine, is already informed of the matter. I"
14535,I.,"will go with you this very night, and he will take you and your"
14536,I.,"children safely over the river. Run--let us run for life."""
14537,I.,
14538,I.,"The duchess came to the house of good Richard, where she found her"
14539,I.,"children. But Lillie was quite sick, and lay upon Richard's cot,"
14540,I.,suffering from a high fever. She did not even know her mother. How
14541,I.,"could that good lady leave her sick child? She did not wish to do it,"
14542,I.,"but the peasant told her that she could be of no assistance, and that"
14543,I.,he would see that she was well provided for.
14544,I.,
14545,I.,"""Run,"" said he, ""for your life is in danger."""
14546,I.,
14547,I.,It was a sad moment when Lillie's mother was compelled to leave her
14548,I.,"child lying upon that sick bed; but the good woman, before giving her"
14549,I.,"a parting kiss, knelt at her side, and said,--"
14550,I.,
14551,I.,"""O Lord, I commit this dear child to thee for safe keeping. I believe"
14552,I.,"thou wilt one day restore her to me."""
14553,I.,
14554,I.,"The duchess was silent for a few moments; then, calmly arising, she"
14555,I.,"kissed her child, took Carl by the hand, and hastened through the"
14556,I.,door towards the distant river.
14557,I.,
14558,I.,"She finally came to the old ferryman's house, and he gave them a great"
14559,I.,"deal of welcome, having provided some warm soup and bread to"
14560,I.,"strengthen them. They were taken over the river, and the two brothers,"
14561,I.,"Solomon and Richard, returned in the boat."
14562,I.,
14563,I.,It was a desolate condition in which the duchess and her child were
14564,I.,"placed, and we must follow her in her wanderings. The farther she went"
14565,I.,"from the river, the safer it would be for her and Carl. She followed"
14566,I.,"the direction which Richard had given her, until she reached"
14567,I.,"Switzerland. But her delay there came near costing her her life, for"
14568,I.,she learned that a detective officer was in search of them. With all
14569,I.,"the haste possible, she got across the Swiss boundary into the Tyrol,"
14570,I.,which was Austrian territory. There she was safe. They passed over
14571,I.,"high mountains, and through deep valleys, seeking a place where they"
14572,I.,"could settle. At last they came to a certain valley, which, in quiet"
14573,I.,"beauty, surpassed anything that they had seen."
14574,I.,
14575,I.,"""This reminds me more of home,"" she said, ""than any country through"
14576,I.,which we have passed. I have got several hundred louis which good
14577,I.,"Richard saved when our house was plundered, and we can afford to rent"
14578,I.,"a little cottage."""
14579,I.,
14580,I.,The old Tyrolese peasant told her that there was no house for sale in
14581,I.,"all the valley. ""But,"" said he, ""you can board in my cottage if you"
14582,I.,"choose."""
14583,I.,
14584,I.,"The price was agreed upon, and the duchess and her son became inmates"
14585,I.,of the family. The little room which was to be their home was very
14586,I.,"plainly furnished; but simple as it was, the first thing that she did"
14587,I.,"on entering it was to kneel there with her child, and thank God for a"
14588,I.,shelter. She arranged her affairs as well as she could for a
14589,I.,"permanent residence with the Tyrolese peasant, and she began to look"
14590,I.,upon it as home.
14591,I.,
14592,I.,One day she told the peasant that she wished to send her little boy
14593,I.,"Carl to school, if there was a good schoolmaster in the neighborhood."
14594,I.,
14595,I.,"""The pastor in a neighboring village,"" said the peasant, ""will be here"
14596,I.,"to-day to catechise my child. He teaches school, and I think you can"
14597,I.,"make an arrangement with him."""
14598,I.,
14599,I.,"That day the gray-haired old pastor came, and an arrangement was made"
14600,I.,"with him for Carl to go to school to him. Books were provided for him,"
14601,I.,and he went to school with the greatest pleasure. He was a rapid
14602,I.,"student, and repeated his lessons every evening to his mother."
14603,I.,
14604,I.,"In the Tyrol a great many canary birds are trained, and are sold to"
14605,I.,dealers all through the country. The old Tyrolese peasant with whom
14606,I.,"the duchess and Carl were boarding had a young and beautiful bird,"
14607,I.,"which sang very sweetly. Carl asked his mother to buy this bird,"
14608,I.,"saying,--"
14609,I.,
14610,I.,"""Mother, this bird is very much like the one that our dear, sweet"
14611,I.,"Lillie used to have. Buy it for me, so that it may learn how to sing."""
14612,I.,
14613,I.,"The duchess bought the bird, and soon became very much attached to it."
14614,I.,"Carl took the greatest pleasure in its training, and in due time,"
14615,I.,little Tim--for that was his name--would come to him and peck at his
14616,I.,"fingers, and rub his little head on Carl's hand."
14617,I.,
14618,I.,"Carl was a natural musician, just as his father was, and would"
14619,I.,sometimes play on a flute which the old Tyrolese peasant had. Little
14620,I.,"Tim would imitate his tunes, and sometimes the concert was well worth"
14621,I.,hearing.
14622,I.,
14623,I.,The old pastor provided the duchess with news. One day he gave her a
14624,I.,"French newspaper, and in the first column which she read there was a"
14625,I.,long list of the names of noblemen who had been beheaded. Among them
14626,I.,"she read the name of her husband, Henry Erlan. The newspaper fell from"
14627,I.,"her hands, and she swooned away. A severe illness came on, and it was"
14628,I.,a long time doubtful whether she would recover. The old Tyrolese
14629,I.,"despaired of her life, and said,--"
14630,I.,
14631,I.,"""The coming autumn may find her no more with us; but who knows what"
14632,I.,"the good Lord will bring out of all this sorrow?"""
14633,I.,
14634,I.,
14635,II.,II.
14636,II.,
14637,II.,"The old servant Richard, having rescued his good mistress from arrest,"
14638,II.,"and probably from death, now formed the resolution to save his master"
14639,II.,"too. He had not much time to plan, for he learned that the duke was to"
14640,II.,be beheaded the following week. It so happened that the son of his
14641,II.,"brother Solomon, the ferryman, belonged to the National Guard, and was"
14642,II.,stationed at the prison to guard it. If he could only secure him to
14643,II.,"engage in the enterprise, he felt that he could succeed. It was a"
14644,II.,difficult thing to get a word to say to any member of the National
14645,II.,"Guard. But old Richard had done many kind things for his nephew, and"
14646,II.,"he succeeded in getting a note to him through the post office,"
14647,II.,"appointing a time, when he was off duty, to meet him. Richard opened"
14648,II.,"the whole enterprise freely to his nephew, and told him all the great"
14649,II.,"injustice that had been done a noble family, and the sufferings"
14650,II.,through which the different members had passed.
14651,II.,
14652,II.,"The duke was informed that he was to be beheaded next day, and his"
14653,II.,door was marked by the prison-keeper as the room of a man who was to
14654,II.,be executed the following morning. The good man knelt in prayer after
14655,II.,"the intelligence had been conveyed to him, and said,--"
14656,II.,
14657,II.,"""To whom shall I go for help and courage, this last night of my life,"
14658,II.,"but to thee, O Lord? Thou knowest best what will happen to me. If it"
14659,II.,"be in accordance with thy will, permit me to see my wife and children"
14660,II.,again. If thou seest that it is not best for thy glory that I should
14661,II.,"live, then I will obey willingly. Thy will, not mine, be done."""
14662,II.,
14663,II.,"[Illustration: ""FATHER, FATHER! THAT IS THE VERY TUNE WHICH WE WERE"
14664,II.,"SINGING TOGETHER THE NIGHT THAT YOU WERE ARRESTED."" See page 327.]"
14665,II.,
14666,II.,That was a noble prayer. Scarcely had the last word fallen from his
14667,II.,"lips, when he heard somebody gently lifting the latch of his door, and"
14668,II.,inserting the key.
14669,II.,
14670,II.,"""Save yourself,"" whispered the person who entered, who was none other"
14671,II.,"than old Solomon's son, to whom Richard had confided his enterprise."
14672,II.,"It was two o'clock in the morning, the very best time to accomplish"
14673,II.,his purpose.
14674,II.,
14675,II.,"""Put on these clothes,"" said he, as he unfolded a soldier's uniform;"
14676,II.,"""take this hat, and here is a gun. As quickly as you possibly can,"
14677,II.,"transform yourself into a soldier."""
14678,II.,
14679,II.,"They escaped in safety from the prison, accompanied by the faithful"
14680,II.,"Richard, and went as rapidly as they could towards the Rhine. They"
14681,II.,reached old Solomon's ferry house. The young man knocked gently at the
14682,II.,"window, and asked his father to come out as soon as possible and take"
14683,II.,the duke over the river.
14684,II.,
14685,II.,"""Are you not going to take your little girl with you?"" said the old"
14686,II.,ferryman.
14687,II.,
14688,II.,"""What little girl?"" asked the duke."
14689,II.,
14690,II.,"""Your little daughter, whom my brother has brought here this very day;"
14691,II.,and she is as sweet a child as I ever saw in my life. She lies asleep
14692,II.,"now in the corner of the room."""
14693,II.,
14694,II.,"This was news which the nobleman did not expect to hear, and he was"
14695,II.,"almost overcome with joy. But he had no time to spend in greeting,"
14696,II.,except to give his dear Lillie a kiss. Soon they were over the Rhine;
14697,II.,"but before reaching the bank on the opposite side, they were fired at"
14698,II.,by soldiers who had come in search of them. A bullet passed through
14699,II.,"the top of the duke's high soldier hat, but he was not harmed, and"
14700,II.,escaped in safety.
14701,II.,
14702,II.,"The great task for him to accomplish now was to find his wife and boy,"
14703,II.,though he had but little hope of ever finding them. Old Richard had
14704,II.,"enough money to buy the duke a horse; so the father mounted the horse,"
14705,II.,and took his little daughter on the saddle with him. They travelled
14706,II.,"over the mountains and through the vales, asking, whenever they met"
14707,II.,"any person, to tell them if they knew of any strangers in that section"
14708,II.,of the country. But nobody gave any information.
14709,II.,
14710,II.,"Old Richard was yet with them, for he had still enough money left to"
14711,II.,"buy a mule, and he rode beside his good master and Lillie until the"
14712,II.,"17th of July arrived, and that was Lillie's birthday. The duke"
14713,II.,determined that they three should stop and celebrate it by taking a
14714,II.,little rest and a good meal in a cottage by the wayside. Having
14715,II.,"finished their dinner, they went out of doors and looked about the"
14716,II.,"beautiful yard, which was all blooming with flowers. A bird cage was"
14717,II.,"hanging by the side of the door, and the bird was singing the tune to"
14718,II.,these words:--
14719,II.,
14720,II.,"""Take courage, bird;"
14721,II.,"Our Father says,"
14722,II.,In winter's storms
14723,II.,And summer's rays
14724,II.,"You have no barns,"
14725,II.,"You sow no wheat,"
14726,II.,"But God will give you bread to eat."""
14727,II.,
14728,II.,"Lillie was astounded at again hearing that sweet melody, and she"
14729,II.,"exclaimed,--"
14730,II.,
14731,II.,"""Father, father! that is the very tune which we were singing together"
14732,II.,"the night that you were arrested."""
14733,II.,
14734,II.,"The little bird went over it two or three times, and the father"
14735,II.,"said,--"
14736,II.,
14737,II.,"""You are right, my dear child. That is the melody--not a note is"
14738,II.,wanting. This is truly wonderful. I do believe that this bird has been
14739,II.,"taught to sing that song by Carl and your good mother. O, Richard, can"
14740,II.,"you not find out how this bird came here?"""
14741,II.,
14742,II.,"Richard said in reply,--"
14743,II.,
14744,II.,"""I will do all I can, but I am afraid that it will be very difficult."""
14745,II.,
14746,II.,"He made inquiries of the man who owned the bird, and who had furnished"
14747,II.,"them with the dinner, as to where the bird came from. The Tyrolese"
14748,II.,"replied,--"
14749,II.,
14750,II.,"""I don't know where it came from, except that a young man who passed"
14751,II.,"along the road, and who lives about three miles from here, sold it to"
14752,II.,"me for a trifling sum one day. I was pleased with its appearance,"
14753,II.,"because it was a beautiful bird, and the price was very low."""
14754,II.,
14755,II.,"Then Richard said,--"
14756,II.,
14757,II.,"""Can you not see that young man, and find out where he got it from?"""
14758,II.,
14759,II.,"""I will do so if you wish,"" he answered."
14760,II.,
14761,II.,Richard then told him to report as soon as possible what he had
14762,II.,learned.
14763,II.,
14764,II.,"That afternoon, about five o'clock, the young man was brought to"
14765,II.,"Richard and the duke, and inquiries were made as to where he got the"
14766,II.,"bird. He said that he did not know where it came from exactly, except"
14767,II.,that it was found one day after it had escaped from somebody's cage.
14768,II.,"He did not know who owned it, or else he would have taken it to its"
14769,II.,owner.
14770,II.,
14771,II.,"""Where was it you found it?"" said the duke."
14772,II.,
14773,II.,"""About ten miles from here, when I was going to see my mother, who"
14774,II.,"lives a great many miles away."""
14775,II.,
14776,II.,"""Do you know whether any strangers are in that neighborhood?"" asked"
14777,II.,the duke.
14778,II.,
14779,II.,"""I heard my mother say that there were a lady and a little boy living"
14780,II.,"some three miles the other side of her house, and that she was a very"
14781,II.,"good woman."""
14782,II.,
14783,II.,"""Did you ever see the boy yourself?"" inquired the duke."
14784,II.,
14785,II.,"""Yes, I saw the boy going to school."""
14786,II.,
14787,II.,"The duke, on making further inquiries as to his appearance, came to"
14788,II.,the conclusion that the boy whom he had seen was probably none other
14789,II.,than Carl. He accordingly made his arrangements to go to the place of
14790,II.,which the young man had spoken.
14791,II.,
14792,II.,That night he reached the house where this good lady and her son were
14793,II.,"boarding. True enough, the duke and little Lillie were in the presence"
14794,II.,"of the duchess and Carl. It was a happy meeting, far beyond my power"
14795,II.,to describe. Their gratitude to their heavenly Father for preserving
14796,II.,them to each other knew no bounds. It was an hour of such happiness as
14797,II.,is seldom permitted any one to enjoy.
14798,II.,
14799,II.,They sat up late that night and recounted their experiences to each
14800,II.,"other, and then the duke revealed the secret of his coming to that"
14801,II.,house; that it was a canary bird which had been the instrument of his
14802,II.,"finding her and Carl. They spent a few days in great happiness there,"
14803,II.,and made a bargain with the man who owned the canary bird which had
14804,II.,escaped from Carl's cage to get it back again.
14805,II.,
14806,II.,"Two years passed on, and peace and quiet were again restored to"
14807,II.,France. The duke and his family were permitted to return to his
14808,II.,"castle, and the government made him ample reparation for all the"
14809,II.,losses that he had incurred. They took with them their little canary
14810,II.,"bird, which had lost none of its sweet notes by the lapse of time."
14811,II.,
14812,II.,"One day a magnificent new piano arrived from Paris, and after tea the"
14813,II.,"duke said,--"
14814,II.,
14815,II.,"""Now we will try the piano in our own quiet home. What shall we sing?"""
14816,II.,asked he.
14817,II.,
14818,II.,"The duchess, and Carl, and Lillie all answered with one voice,--"
14819,II.,
14820,II.,"""We must sing our bird song."""
14821,II.,
14822,II.,"""Take courage, bird;"
14823,II.,"Our Father says,"
14824,II.,In winter's storms

14971,MY STORY.,"Many years ago, when the sky was as clear, the flowers as fragrant,"
14972,MY STORY.,"and the birds as musical as now, I stood by a little mahogany table,"
14973,MY STORY.,"with pencil and paper in hand, vainly trying to add a short column of"
14974,MY STORY.,"figures. My small tin box, with the word _Bank_ in large letters upon"
14975,MY STORY.,"it, had just been opened, and the carefully hoarded treasure of six"
14976,MY STORY.,months was spread out before me. Scrip had not come into use then; and
14977,MY STORY.,"there were one tiny gold piece, two silver dollars, and many quarters,"
14978,MY STORY.,"dimes, half-dimes, and pennies. For a full half hour I had been"
14979,MY STORY.,counting my fingers and trying to reckon up how much it all amounted
14980,MY STORY.,to; but the problem was too hard for me. At last I took pencil and
14981,MY STORY.,"paper, and sought to work it out by figures."
14982,MY STORY.,
14983,MY STORY.,"""What are you doing, Gracie?"" pleasantly inquired my father, entering"
14984,MY STORY.,the room with an open letter in his hand.
14985,MY STORY.,
14986,MY STORY.,"""O, papa! is that you?"" I cried, eagerly turning towards him. ""Just"
14987,MY STORY.,look--see how much money I've got! John has just opened my bank. It is
14988,MY STORY.,"six months to-day since I began to save, and I've more than I"
14989,MY STORY.,"expected."""
14990,MY STORY.,
14991,MY STORY.,"""Yes, you are quite rich."""
14992,MY STORY.,
14993,MY STORY.,"""So much that I can't even count it. I've done harder sums in addition"
14994,MY STORY.,"at school; but somehow, now, every time I add, I get a different"
14995,MY STORY.,"answer. I can't make it come out twice alike."""
14996,MY STORY.,
14997,MY STORY.,"""Where did you get that gold piece?"""
14998,MY STORY.,
14999,MY STORY.,"""Why, don't you know? _You_ gave it to me for letting Dr. Strong pull"
15000,MY STORY.,"out my big back tooth."""
15001,MY STORY.,
15002,MY STORY.,Father laughed.
15003,MY STORY.,
15004,MY STORY.,"""Did I?"" said he; ""I had forgotten it. But where did you get those two"
15005,MY STORY.,"silver dollars?"" he inquired."
15006,MY STORY.,
15007,MY STORY.,"""O, grandmother gave me this one. It's _chicken_ money. She gave it to"
15008,MY STORY.,me for feeding the chickens every morning all the while I staid there;
15009,MY STORY.,and the other is _hat_ money. Aunt Ellen told me if I'd wear my hat
15010,MY STORY.,"always when I went out in the sun, and so keep from getting"
15011,MY STORY.,"sun-burned, that she would give me another dollar; and she did."""
15012,MY STORY.,
15013,MY STORY.,"""Where did the remainder come from?"""
15014,MY STORY.,
15015,MY STORY.,"""Mostly from you, papa. You are always giving me money. These two"
15016,MY STORY.,"bright, new quarters you gave me when you looked over my writing-book,"
15017,MY STORY.,"and saw it hadn't a blot. How much is there in all?"" I earnestly"
15018,MY STORY.,asked.
15019,MY STORY.,
15020,MY STORY.,"Father glanced at the little pile, and smilingly said,--"
15021,MY STORY.,
15022,MY STORY.,"""Seven dollars and ten cents. That's a good deal of money for a little"
15023,MY STORY.,"girl only nine years old to spend."""
15024,MY STORY.,
15025,MY STORY.,"""And may I spend it just as I please?"""
15026,MY STORY.,
15027,MY STORY.,"""Certainly, my dear; just as you please. It's a great thing for little"
15028,MY STORY.,"people to learn to spend money wisely."""
15029,MY STORY.,
15030,MY STORY.,"Saying this, he seated himself by the window, and drawing me towards"
15031,MY STORY.,"him, placed me upon one knee."
15032,MY STORY.,
15033,MY STORY.,"""Gracie, dear, I have just received a letter from grandmother. She"
15034,MY STORY.,proposes that I come to Vermont and bring you; that I remain as long
15035,MY STORY.,"as business will admit, and leave you to pass the summer just as you"
15036,MY STORY.,"did last year. How would that suit?"" fixing his kind dark eyes full"
15037,MY STORY.,upon my upturned face to read my changing thoughts.
15038,MY STORY.,
15039,MY STORY.,"""O, I should like it very much!"" I quickly exclaimed, clapping my"
15040,MY STORY.,"hands with delight. Then I reflected a moment, and a shadow fell over"
15041,MY STORY.,my prospective happiness.
15042,MY STORY.,
15043,MY STORY.,"""On the whole, papa,"" I said, earnestly, ""I think I had better go, and"
15044,MY STORY.,not stay any longer than you can stay. I am all the little girl _you_
15045,MY STORY.,"have, and you are all the parent _I_ have, and we should be very"
15046,MY STORY.,"lonely without each other."""
15047,MY STORY.,
15048,MY STORY.,"I felt his warm, loving kiss upon my cheek as he folded me to his"
15049,MY STORY.,"heart, and a tear fell on my forehead. For two years I had been"
15050,MY STORY.,motherless; but a double portion of pity and tenderness had been
15051,MY STORY.,lavished upon me by my indulgent father. He was a New York merchant of
15052,MY STORY.,ample means. Our home was elegant and tasteful.
15053,MY STORY.,
15054,MY STORY.,"The home of my father's only surviving parent, my doting grandmother,"
15055,MY STORY.,"whom we were designing to visit, was a plain, unpretending farm-house,"
15056,MY STORY.,snuggly nestled up among the hills of Vermont. There were tall poplar
15057,MY STORY.,"trees and a flower-garden in front, a little orchard and a whole row"
15058,MY STORY.,of nice looking out-buildings in the rear. There was no place on earth
15059,MY STORY.,"so full of joy for me. The swallows' nests on the barn; the turkeys,"
15060,MY STORY.,"geese, and chickens; the colt, lambs, and little pigs; in short,"
15061,MY STORY.,"everything had an ever-increasing attraction, far exceeding any"
15062,MY STORY.,pleasures to be found within the limits of the crowded city.
15063,MY STORY.,
15064,MY STORY.,The prospect of another visit to Woodville filled my heart with
15065,MY STORY.,intense delight.
15066,MY STORY.,
15067,MY STORY.,"A week passed, and on one of the sunniest and freshest of June"
15068,MY STORY.,mornings we started for Vermont. I was exceedingly fond of travelling
15069,MY STORY.,"in the cars, and it seemed as if a thousand sunbeams had suddenly"
15070,MY STORY.,"fallen upon my young life. The train left New York, and we found"
15071,MY STORY.,"ourselves rapidly whirling past hills, forests, towns, and villages."
15072,MY STORY.,"Sometimes we were flying through dark, deep cuts, then crossing"
15073,MY STORY.,streams and rich green fields and meadows.
15074,MY STORY.,
15075,MY STORY.,We expected to reach grandmother's that evening. I had written to
15076,MY STORY.,inform her of our coming. One hour after another passed. The day was
15077,MY STORY.,"declining, and the sun was slowly sinking in the west."
15078,MY STORY.,
15079,MY STORY.,"""How much longer have we to go?"" was the question I had asked for the"
15080,MY STORY.,fiftieth time at least.
15081,MY STORY.,
15082,MY STORY.,"""About another hour's ride, Gracie,"" smilingly answered my father. ""I"
15083,MY STORY.,"think we shall reach Woodville about eight."""
15084,MY STORY.,
15085,MY STORY.,The cars continued to hurry on till we were within a few rods of the
15086,MY STORY.,station.
15087,MY STORY.,
15088,MY STORY.,"The bell was ringing its usual warning, and the bell from a train from"
15089,MY STORY.,"behind was beginning to be heard. We had commenced to switch off, to"
15090,MY STORY.,allow the express train to pass. But by some carelessness or
15091,MY STORY.,miscalculation our train was a minute too late. Father and I were
15092,MY STORY.,comfortably occupying one of the front seats of the rear car; and I
15093,MY STORY.,was in a state of impatient excitement to reach our destination. But
15094,MY STORY.,"there came, in an instant, a stunning, frightful crash; and I was"
15095,MY STORY.,thrown violently forward. What followed for the next ten minutes I do
15096,MY STORY.,not know.
15097,MY STORY.,
15098,MY STORY.,"I think I must have been in a semi-unconscious state, for I have a dim"
15099,MY STORY.,"recollection of strange sounds, confusion, anxiety, and terror. Strong"
15100,MY STORY.,"hands seemed to pull me out from under a heavy weight, and gently lay"
15101,MY STORY.,"me down. I felt dizzy and faint. I opened my eyes, and light came"
15102,MY STORY.,gradually to my darkened vision. A gentleman stood over me with his
15103,MY STORY.,"fingers upon my wrist. A kind, sunny-faced old lady was wetting my"
15104,MY STORY.,head.
15105,MY STORY.,
15106,MY STORY.,"""Are you much hurt?"" she tenderly inquired, gazing upon me in"
15107,MY STORY.,undisguised anxiety.
15108,MY STORY.,
15109,MY STORY.,"""What's the matter? Where am I?"" I cried, springing up and gazing"
15110,MY STORY.,wildly around.
15111,MY STORY.,
15112,MY STORY.,In a moment my eye caught sight of the broken rear car. There were
15113,MY STORY.,several wounded and bleeding people about me. I saw the front cars
15114,MY STORY.,"emptied of passengers, who were actively employed in caring for the"
15115,MY STORY.,injured. I comprehended in an instant that there had been an accident.
15116,MY STORY.,
15117,MY STORY.,"""My father! my father!"" I cried."
15118,MY STORY.,
15119,MY STORY.,"""You shall see him soon,"" soothingly answered the gentleman by my"
15120,MY STORY.,"side. ""Drink this;"" and he held to my mouth a glass of something"
15121,MY STORY.,pleasant and pungent. I drank its entire contents. I think it helped
15122,MY STORY.,to quite restore me. I ran wildly about in search of my missing
15123,MY STORY.,parent. There was a little group of men and women a short distance
15124,MY STORY.,"off. I hurried towards it, and recognized Peter, my grandmother's man,"
15125,MY STORY.,who had come to meet us at the station.
15126,MY STORY.,
15127,MY STORY.,"""Where is my father?"" I said in a voice hardly audible from terror,"
15128,MY STORY.,seizing Peter's arm.
15129,MY STORY.,
15130,MY STORY.,"Before he could reply, I saw father, white and motionless, upon the"
15131,MY STORY.,ground.
15132,MY STORY.,
15133,MY STORY.,"""He is dead!"" I shrieked, springing towards him, and convulsively"
15134,MY STORY.,throwing my arms about him.
15135,MY STORY.,
15136,MY STORY.,"""He is stunned, _not_ dead, my child,"" said the physician, kindly"
15137,MY STORY.,"drawing me away, to minister to him. ""We hope he will soon be better."""
15138,MY STORY.,
15139,MY STORY.,"In spite of his soothing words and tones, I read the truth in his"
15140,MY STORY.,face; that he feared life was almost extinct.
15141,MY STORY.,
15142,MY STORY.,"""O, what can I do? Save him! save him! You must _not_ let him die! you"
15143,MY STORY.,"must _not_!"""
15144,MY STORY.,
15145,MY STORY.,"""My poor child, I will do all I can,"" replied the physician, touched"
15146,MY STORY.,by my distress.
15147,MY STORY.,
15148,MY STORY.,But no efforts to restore my father to consciousness availed anything.
15149,MY STORY.,"There was a deep, ugly cut on one side of his head. No other external"
15150,MY STORY.,injury could be found; yet he had not spoken or moved since he was
15151,MY STORY.,taken out from the broken car.
15152,MY STORY.,
15153,MY STORY.,The accident had occurred but a few rods from the station; and as
15154,MY STORY.,"grandmother's house was scarcely a mile distant, Peter strongly urged"
15155,MY STORY.,that he should be taken there at once. Accordingly a wagon was
15156,MY STORY.,"procured. The seats were taken out, and a mattress placed upon the"
15157,MY STORY.,"bottom, and father was carefully laid upon it; and Peter drove rapidly"
15158,MY STORY.,"home, while I followed with the doctor in his buggy. A man had been"
15159,MY STORY.,sent in advance of us to inform grandmother of our coming. She met us
15160,MY STORY.,"at the door with a pallid face, but was so outwardly calm, that I took"
15161,MY STORY.,courage from beholding her.
15162,MY STORY.,
15163,MY STORY.,"Father was laid upon a nice, white bed, in a little room on the ground"
15164,MY STORY.,floor; and again every means for restoring him was resorted to. Still
15165,MY STORY.,he remained unconscious.
15166,MY STORY.,
15167,MY STORY.,"The hours went on. The old family clock had just struck two, and we"
15168,MY STORY.,were watching and working in an agony of suspense.
15169,MY STORY.,
15170,MY STORY.,"I had not left my father's bedside, till the low, indistinct"
15171,MY STORY.,"conversation between the doctor and grandmother, in the next room,"
15172,MY STORY.,fell upon my ear.
15173,MY STORY.,
15174,MY STORY.,"""There is life yet,"" said he. ""I thought once he had ceased to"
15175,MY STORY.,"breathe."""
15176,MY STORY.,
15177,MY STORY.,"""And you are quite sure he does?"" she inquired."
15178,MY STORY.,
15179,MY STORY.,"""Yes. I held a small mirror over his face; and the mist that gathered"
15180,MY STORY.,"upon it proves there is still faint breathing."""
15181,MY STORY.,
15182,MY STORY.,I shuddered and ran out to them.
15183,MY STORY.,
15184,MY STORY.,"""You think he will die!"" I cried, seizing grandmother's hand with"
15185,MY STORY.,desperate energy.
15186,MY STORY.,
15187,MY STORY.,"""I cannot tell, dear Gracie. His life, like yours and mine, is in the"
15188,MY STORY.,hands of God. We cannot foresee his purposes. We can only submit to
15189,MY STORY.,"his will."""
15190,MY STORY.,
15191,MY STORY.,"Saying this, she returned with the doctor to the sick room, and I was"
15192,MY STORY.,left alone.
15193,MY STORY.,
15194,MY STORY.,The prospect of being deprived of my only surviving parent almost
15195,MY STORY.,"paralyzed me. I looked out of the open window. It was a calm, clear"
15196,MY STORY.,"summer night. The moon shone out in all its glory and brilliancy, and"
15197,MY STORY.,"the stars twinkled as cheerily as though there was no sorrow,"
15198,MY STORY.,"suffering, or death in the world."
15199,MY STORY.,
15200,MY STORY.,"I sprang towards the door and closed it, and then threw myself upon my"
15201,MY STORY.,"knees, and poured out my great anguish into the pitying ear of the"
15202,MY STORY.,heavenly Father.
15203,MY STORY.,
15204,MY STORY.,"""O, good, kind Father in heaven, do hear and quickly answer me. Do"
15205,MY STORY.,"save my own dear papa from death. Mother, Bessie, and little Fred have"
15206,MY STORY.,"all gone to live with thee; and he is all I have left. Do, I entreat"
15207,MY STORY.,"thee, help him to get well; I will be more kind, and generous, and"
15208,MY STORY.,"obedient than I have ever been before, and will try to please thee as"
15209,MY STORY.,"long as I live."""
15210,MY STORY.,
15211,MY STORY.,"I arose comforted and strengthened. Returning to my father's room, I"
15212,MY STORY.,saw the doctor with his fingers upon his wrist again.
15213,MY STORY.,
15214,MY STORY.,"""A faint pulse,"" he said, turning towards grandmother."
15215,MY STORY.,
15216,MY STORY.,"Another hour passed. The breath was perceptible now, and the doctor"
15217,MY STORY.,looked more hopefully.
15218,MY STORY.,
15219,MY STORY.,"Morning came, and the glad sunlight streamed in through the windows."
15220,MY STORY.,"Father remained in a deep stupor, but manifested more signs of life"
15221,MY STORY.,than at any time since the accident. He had moved slightly several
15222,MY STORY.,"times, and as the hours went on his breathing became more natural and"
15223,MY STORY.,regular.
15224,MY STORY.,
15225,MY STORY.,Suddenly he opened his eyes and gazed feebly around.
15226,MY STORY.,
15227,MY STORY.,"""Father, dear father, are you better?"" I cried in a choking voice."
15228,MY STORY.,
15229,MY STORY.,"He smiled faintly, then closed his eyes again, and sank into a sweet,"
15230,MY STORY.,refreshing slumber.
15231,MY STORY.,
15232,MY STORY.,"Another day came, bringing joy immeasurable to all of us. Father was"
15233,MY STORY.,"conscious and rallying fast, and before night the doctor assured us"
15234,MY STORY.,all danger was past. The weeks went on.
15235,MY STORY.,
15236,MY STORY.,June went out and July came in. We had been nearly a month in
15237,MY STORY.,Woodville; and how different my visit had resulted from the season of
15238,MY STORY.,perfect happiness I had so ardently anticipated!
15239,MY STORY.,
15240,MY STORY.,Father was gradually regaining his former health; and although the
15241,MY STORY.,"wound on his head was but partially healed, he was pronounced doing"
15242,MY STORY.,admirably by the attentive physician.
15243,MY STORY.,
15244,MY STORY.,"He was now able to go out, and we took many long rides together,"
15245,MY STORY.,keenly enjoying the beautiful scenery and the pure air. As strength
15246,MY STORY.,"increased, the necessity of returning to his business pressed upon my"
15247,MY STORY.,"father, and the first week in September was appointed for our"
15248,MY STORY.,departure.
15249,MY STORY.,
15250,MY STORY.,"On the last Sunday of our sojourn in Woodville, grandmother and I went"
15251,MY STORY.,in the morning to church. There had just been a fearfully destructive
15252,MY STORY.,"fire in one of the neighboring towns, and a large number of people"
15253,MY STORY.,were homeless. The minister announced that at the close of the
15254,MY STORY.,"afternoon service, a collection would be taken up for the sufferers,"
15255,MY STORY.,and he strongly urged a generous contribution from his parishioners.
15256,MY STORY.,
15257,MY STORY.,"I had hitherto paid little heed, when in church, to what the minister"
15258,MY STORY.,said; but since the dreadful accident and father's almost miraculous
15259,MY STORY.,"recovery, I had been far more thoughtful and attentive than formerly."
15260,MY STORY.,"My heart went out in deep sympathy and pity for the poor men, women,"
15261,MY STORY.,"and children who were made houseless in a single night, and I ardently"
15262,MY STORY.,longed to do the little in my power to relieve them.
15263,MY STORY.,
15264,MY STORY.,"So, during the intermission between the services, I took out the money"
15265,MY STORY.,"I had brought with me, and which father had told me I was free to"
15266,MY STORY.,spend as I pleased. I tied it up in my handkerchief. There was too
15267,MY STORY.,"much for my pocket-book to conveniently hold, for it was all of the"
15268,MY STORY.,carefully hoarded treasure of my bank. It was my design to put it into
15269,MY STORY.,the contribution-box.
15270,MY STORY.,
15271,MY STORY.,Grandmother did not go to church in the afternoon; but father decided
15272,MY STORY.,"to go, and I accompanied him. After the services were over, two men"
15273,MY STORY.,arose and began to pass round the boxes to collect money for the
15274,MY STORY.,people whose homes had been burned. As I beheld one of them coming
15275,MY STORY.,"slowly up the aisle, stopping at every pew, I was in a flutter of"
15276,MY STORY.,excitement. It was a novel thing for me to put money into the
15277,MY STORY.,"contribution-box, and my heart beat violently."
15278,MY STORY.,
15279,MY STORY.,"I drew out my handkerchief from my pocket, and hurriedly began to"
15280,MY STORY.,untie the knot. But my usually nimble fingers were provokingly slow to
15281,MY STORY.,"act now; and I pulled and pulled away, but to no purpose. The knot"
15282,MY STORY.,obstinately refused to yield. The man with the box had nearly reached
15283,MY STORY.,"our pew, and I began to fear I should lose the chance to give."
15284,MY STORY.,
15285,MY STORY.,"""Don't let him slip by me,"" I whispered so loudly to father as to"
15286,MY STORY.,cause at least a dozen persons in the adjacent seats to stare
15287,MY STORY.,"wonderingly at me. ""I've something to put in."""
15288,MY STORY.,
15289,MY STORY.,"Another prodigious effort, and the knot yielded."
15290,MY STORY.,
15291,MY STORY.,"The man passed the box first to father, and he put in a bill. He"
15292,MY STORY.,"glanced at me, evidently thinking a child would hardly have money to"
15293,MY STORY.,"give, and was about to go on; but I looked beseechingly towards him,"
15294,MY STORY.,and he stopped and extended the box to me. In an instant the entire
15295,MY STORY.,contents of my handkerchief were emptied into it--as much money as my
15296,MY STORY.,two chubby hands could hold.
15297,MY STORY.,
15298,MY STORY.,"Father looked down upon me, and a half-amused smile flitted over his"
15299,MY STORY.,"face, as he beheld my unexpected act."
15300,MY STORY.,
15301,MY STORY.,"After we had returned home, father sat down by the window in an easy"
15302,MY STORY.,"chair, and calling me to him, placed me upon his knee."
15303,MY STORY.,
15304,MY STORY.,"""Gracie, dear,"" said he, smilingly, ""tell me how it happened you put"
15305,MY STORY.,so much money into the contribution-box. It must have taken nearly all
15306,MY STORY.,"you had."""
15307,MY STORY.,
15308,MY STORY.,"""It _was_ all I had, papa. It was the money I saved in my bank, and"
15309,MY STORY.,"you told me I could spend it just as I pleased."""
15310,MY STORY.,
15311,MY STORY.,"""O, yes, dear; I am glad to have you; only it was a good deal for a"
15312,MY STORY.,"little girl."""
15313,MY STORY.,
15314,MY STORY.,"""I gave it because I wanted to please God,"" I replied with earnest"
15315,MY STORY.,"solemnity. ""That dreadful night, when we all thought you would die,"
15316,MY STORY.,"dear papa, I promised God I would be a better girl than I have ever"
15317,MY STORY.,"been before. I would be more kind, generous, and obedient, and would"
15318,MY STORY.,"try and please him all my life, if he would only let _you_ get well;"
15319,MY STORY.,"and I gave my money to-day because I am so glad and grateful to him."""
15320,MY STORY.,
15321,MY STORY.,"""Precious child,"" said he tenderly and with much emotion, drawing me"
15322,MY STORY.,"close to him, ""and I am glad, and grateful too, for the rich gift of"

15363,CAMELS.,
15364,CAMELS.,
15365,CAMELS.,The Bactrian camel may be at once known by the two humps upon its
15366,CAMELS.,"back, which give the animal a most singular appearance."
15367,CAMELS.,
15368,CAMELS.,"This species is a native of Central Asia, China, and Thibet, and is"
15369,CAMELS.,"generally as useful in those countries as is the dromedary in Arabia,"
15370,CAMELS.,"being employed for the saddle, for draught, and burden. It is,"
15371,CAMELS.,"however, chiefly employed for the second of those purposes, and is of"
15372,CAMELS.,the greatest service to its owners.
15373,CAMELS.,
15374,CAMELS.,The vehicle to which this camel is generally harnessed is a rude cart
15375,CAMELS.,"of wood, ingeniously put together, without a particle of iron, and,"
15376,CAMELS.,"after the fashion of such structures, shrieking, creaking, and"
15377,CAMELS.,groaning as the wheels turn on their roughly-made and ungreased axle.
15378,CAMELS.,"The drivers, however, care nothing for the hideous and incessant"
15379,CAMELS.,"noise, and probably are so accustomed to it, that they would not feel"
15380,CAMELS.,at home with a cart whose wheels moved silently. The mode of
15381,CAMELS.,harnessing is precisely that which so simple a vehicle requires. From
15382,CAMELS.,"the front of the cart projects a pole, and to this pole are hitched a"
15383,CAMELS.,"pair of camels by a yoke that passes over their shoulders. In fact,"
15384,CAMELS.,the entire harness is nothing more than a wooden yoke and a leathern
15385,CAMELS.,strap.
15386,CAMELS.,
15387,CAMELS.,"In spite, however, of the rude machine to which they are attached, and"
15388,CAMELS.,"the great loss of power by the friction of the badly-fitted wheels,"
15389,CAMELS.,the animals can draw very heavy weights for considerable distances. A
15390,CAMELS.,burden of three thousand pounds' weight is an ordinary load for a pair
15391,CAMELS.,"of camels, and a peculiarly strong yoke of these animals will draw"
15392,CAMELS.,nearly four thousand pounds' weight. This camel is commonly yoked in
15393,CAMELS.,pairs.
15394,CAMELS.,
15395,CAMELS.,"For the plough the camel is never employed, not because it is not"
15396,CAMELS.,"sufficiently strong for the task, but because it does not pull with"
15397,CAMELS.,the steadiness needed to drag the ploughshare regularly through the
15398,CAMELS.,ground.
15399,CAMELS.,
15400,CAMELS.,"Sometimes, however, the Bactrian camel is employed as a beast of"
15401,CAMELS.,"burden, the bales being slung at each side, and the water-skins"
15402,CAMELS.,suspended below the belly. When the animal is employed for this
15403,CAMELS.,"purpose, a kind of pack-saddle is used, somewhat similar in shape to"
15404,CAMELS.,that which has already been described in the history of the one-humped
15405,CAMELS.,"camel, but necessarily modified in its structure. The owner of the"
15406,CAMELS.,"camel takes great care not to overload his animal, as he is afraid of"
15407,CAMELS.,"injuring the humps, and thereby detracting from the value of the"
15408,CAMELS.,camel.
15409,CAMELS.,
15410,CAMELS.,[Illustration: CAMEL OF A TARTAR EMIGRANT.]
15411,CAMELS.,
15412,CAMELS.,In Persia the camel is employed for a very singular purpose. There
15413,CAMELS.,"was, and may be now, a corps of the army which is called the camel"
15414,CAMELS.,"artillery. It consisted of a number of camels, each fitted with a"
15415,CAMELS.,"peculiar saddle, which not only accommodated the rider, but carried"
15416,CAMELS.,a swivel-gun of about one pound calibre. These weapons had a greater
15417,CAMELS.,"range than the ordinary Persian matchlocks, and, owing to the rapidity"
15418,CAMELS.,"with which they could be transferred from spot to spot, formed a"
15419,CAMELS.,valuable branch of the artillery.
15420,CAMELS.,
15421,CAMELS.,When the enemy saw that a detachment of the camel artillery was about
15422,CAMELS.,"to attack them, their usual device was to reach such a position as to"
15423,CAMELS.,"force the camels to traverse wet and muddy ground, in which they were"
15424,CAMELS.,"sure to slip about, to lose all command over their limbs, and"
15425,CAMELS.,sometimes to lame themselves completely by the hind legs slipping
15426,CAMELS.,apart.
15427,CAMELS.,
15428,CAMELS.,"Camels were especially serviceable for this purpose, because they are"
15429,CAMELS.,"wonderfully sure-footed when the ground is dry, almost rivalling the"
15430,CAMELS.,mule in the certainty of the tread. The Arabian camel is notable for
15431,CAMELS.,"his sure tread, but the Bactrian species is still more remarkable in"
15432,CAMELS.,"this respect. Owing, in all probability, to the elongated toe, which"
15433,CAMELS.,"projects beyond the foot, and forms a kind of claw, the Bactrian camel"
15434,CAMELS.,"can climb mountain passes with perfect security, and in consequence of"
15435,CAMELS.,this ability is sometimes called the mountain camel.
15436,CAMELS.,
15437,CAMELS.,"It is as serviceable in winter as in summer. The soft, cushion-like"
15438,CAMELS.,"feet, which slide about so helplessly in mud, take a firm hold of ice,"
15439,CAMELS.,and enable their owner to traverse a frozen surface with easy
15440,CAMELS.,"security. In snow, too, the Bactrian camel is equally at home; and the"
15441,CAMELS.,"Calmucks would rather ride a camel than a horse in the winter, because"
15442,CAMELS.,the longer legs of the former animal enable it to wade through the
15443,CAMELS.,"deep snow, in which a horse could only plunge about without finding a"
15444,CAMELS.,foothold. No greater proof of the extreme utility of this animal can
15445,CAMELS.,be adduced than the fact that a body of two thousand camels were
15446,CAMELS.,"employed in conducting a military train over the ""snow-clad summits"
15447,CAMELS.,"of the Indian Caucasus"" in winter time, and that throughout the space"
15448,CAMELS.,"of seven months only one camel died, having been accidentally killed."
15449,CAMELS.,
15450,CAMELS.,"Although the camel has so strong an objection to mud, it has none to"
15451,CAMELS.,"water, and will wade across a river without hesitation. It can even"
15452,CAMELS.,swim well when the water is too deep to be forded; but it does not
15453,CAMELS.,"appear to have much power of directing its course, or of propelling"
15454,CAMELS.,"itself through the water with much force. Indeed, it may rather be"
15455,CAMELS.,said to float than to swim.
15456,CAMELS.,
15457,CAMELS.,"In point of speed it cannot approach the Arabian dromedary, although"
15458,CAMELS.,it is little inferior to the ordinary camel of burden. About two and a
15459,CAMELS.,half miles per hour is the average pace at which a pair of Bactrian
15460,CAMELS.,"camels will draw a load, varying in weight from three to four thousand"
15461,CAMELS.,"pounds; and if they travel over a well-made road, they can do their"
15462,CAMELS.,"thirty miles a day for many successive days. In countries, therefore,"
15463,CAMELS.,"which are adapted to its habits, the camel is far superior to any"
15464,CAMELS.,"other beast of burden, whether for draught or carriage."
15465,CAMELS.,
15466,CAMELS.,"One great advantage of the camel is, that its feet are so tough, that"
15467,CAMELS.,"they can pass over rough and stony places without suffering, and that"
15468,CAMELS.,therefore the animal does not require the aid of shoes. In an ordinary
15469,CAMELS.,"march, the constant attention to the shoeing of horses and cattle"
15470,CAMELS.,"entails great labor, much watchfulness, and often causes considerable"
15471,CAMELS.,"delay, so that the peculiar formation of the camel's foot, which"
15472,CAMELS.,"neither requires nor admits of an iron shoe, is of exceeding value in"
15473,CAMELS.,a forced march. In some places a leathern shoe is fixed to the camel's
15474,CAMELS.,"foot, but is really of little use."
15475,CAMELS.,
15476,CAMELS.,[Illustration: THE CAMEL.]
15477,CAMELS.,
15478,CAMELS.,The very worst time for the Bactrian camel is the beginning and end of
15479,CAMELS.,"winter, when frost and thaw occur alternately. At such times of the"
15480,CAMELS.,"year the snow falls thickly, is partially melted in the daytime, and"
15481,CAMELS.,at night freezes on the surface into a thin cake of ice. Through this
15482,CAMELS.,"crust the feet of the camel break, and the animal cuts its legs"
15483,CAMELS.,cruelly with the sharp edges of the broken ice.
15484,CAMELS.,
15485,CAMELS.,"For the cold weather itself this species of camel cares little,"
15486,CAMELS.,"passing its whole time in the open air, and feeding on the grass when"
15487,CAMELS.,"it is caked with the ice formed from the dew. Indeed, it bears a"
15488,CAMELS.,"severe winter better than either horse, ox, or sheep, and has been"
15489,CAMELS.,observed to feed with apparent comfort when the thermometer had sunk
15490,CAMELS.,many degrees below zero. In some places--such as the country about
15491,CAMELS.,Lake Baikal--the camel is partially sheltered from the cold by a thick
15492,CAMELS.,"woollen cloth, which is sewn over its body; but even in such cases its"
15493,CAMELS.,"owners do not trouble themselves to furnish it with food, leaving it"
15494,CAMELS.,"to forage for itself among shrubs and trees of higher ground, or among"
15495,CAMELS.,the reeds and rushes that grow on marshy land and the banks of rivers.
15496,CAMELS.,
15497,CAMELS.,Almost the only disease among the Bactrian camels is an affection of
15498,CAMELS.,"the tongue, which is covered with blisters, so that the poor animal"
15499,CAMELS.,"cannot eat, and dies from starvation."
15500,CAMELS.,
15501,CAMELS.,"The fleece of the Bactrian camel ought to weigh about ten pounds, and"
15502,CAMELS.,is used for making a coarse and strong cloth. In the summer time the
15503,CAMELS.,"hair becomes loose, and is easily plucked off by hand, just as sheep"
15504,CAMELS.,"used to be ""rowed"" before shears were employed in removing the wool."
15505,CAMELS.,The camel in the Zoölogical Gardens may be seen in the summer time in
15506,CAMELS.,"a very ragged state, its fleece hanging in bunches in some parts of"
15507,CAMELS.,"the body, while others are quite bare. The price of the wool is about"
15508,CAMELS.,six cents a pound.
15509,CAMELS.,
15510,CAMELS.,"The skin is used for making straps, ropes, and thongs, and is seldom"
15511,CAMELS.,"tanned. It is thought to be inferior to that of the ox, and is in"
15512,CAMELS.,"consequence sold at a comparatively cheap rate, an entire hide only"
15513,CAMELS.,"fetching about two dollars. The milk is used for food, but is produced"
15514,CAMELS.,"in very small quantities, the average yield being only half a gallon."
15515,CAMELS.,"The flesh is eaten, and when the animal is fat is tolerably tender,"
15516,CAMELS.,"and is thought to resemble beef. If, however, it be in poor condition,"
15517,CAMELS.,"the meat is so tough and ill-flavored, that none but hungry men, armed"
15518,CAMELS.,"with good teeth, can eat it. The price of a good Bactrian camel is"
15519,CAMELS.,about fifty dollars.
15520,CAMELS.,
15521,CAMELS.,The weight of a full-grown animal is about one third more than that of
15522,CAMELS.,"the average ox--that is to say, about twelve hundred pounds. The"
15523,CAMELS.,"average height is seven or eight feet, and the animal generally lives"
15524,CAMELS.,about thirty-five or forty years.
15525,CAMELS.,
15526,CAMELS.,Dissimilar in external appearance as are the Bactrian and Arabian
15527,CAMELS.,"camels, their skeletons are so alike, that none but a skilful"
15528,CAMELS.,anatomist can decide upon the species to which a skeleton has
15529,CAMELS.,belonged. The legs of the Bactrian species are rather shorter in
15530,CAMELS.,"proportion than those of the Arabian animal, and in them lies the"
15531,CAMELS.,"chief distinction of the two species. Indeed, many naturalists deny"
15532,CAMELS.,"that there is any real difference of species, and assert that the two"
15533,CAMELS.,animals are simply two varieties of the same species.
15534,CAMELS.,
15535,CAMELS.,"The specimen in the Zoölogical Gardens is called ""Jenny"" by the"
15536,CAMELS.,"keeper, and has rather a curious history, being associated with one of"
15537,CAMELS.,the great events of the present century. During the late Russian war
15538,CAMELS.,"her mother was taken from the enemy in the Crimea, and was"
15539,CAMELS.,unfortunately killed. The deserted little one ran about among the
15540,CAMELS.,"soldiers, and was adopted by the corps of Royal Engineers, who towards"
15541,CAMELS.,the end of 1856 presented her to the Zoölogical Society. Both the
15542,CAMELS.,"camels are fed upon the same diet, and eat about the same quantity."

15619,THORNS.,"""Deepdale is a delightful place to visit."" So thought little Nellie"
15620,THORNS.,Harris when she went there to see Cousin Rose. All day long they
15621,THORNS.,"wandered over the farm with Uncle John, first to feed the chickens,"
15622,THORNS.,then to the well so dark and deep Nellie shuddered when she looked
15623,THORNS.,"far, far down into it, and held tight to Rose for fear of falling."
15624,THORNS.,Uncle John turned the windlass to let Rose and Nellie see the bucket
15625,THORNS.,rise all dripping from its watery bed.
15626,THORNS.,
15627,THORNS.,"One morning after Nellie's return to the city, Rose was walking alone"
15628,THORNS.,in the garden.
15629,THORNS.,
15630,THORNS.,"The flowers were charming, for the dew was not yet off their delicate"
15631,THORNS.,petals; and they were so fragrant that little Rose's nose was put
15632,THORNS.,"close up to a great many, to find which it was that smelled so very"
15633,THORNS.,sweetly. First she was sure it was a great cabbage-rose that nodded at
15634,THORNS.,"her from its stalk, but soon after she was surer that it was a little"
15635,THORNS.,"bed of pansies, or ""Johnny-jump-ups,"" which turned all their bright"
15636,THORNS.,"little faces to the sun, like a family of newly-washed and"
15637,THORNS.,"clean-aproned children just starting for school. Soon, however, she"
15638,THORNS.,"was surest that it was a patch of mignonette under the pear tree,"
15639,THORNS.,"which, though it looked so plain and humble with its little bits of"
15640,THORNS.,"blossoms, was pouring out the richest perfume."
15641,THORNS.,
15642,THORNS.,"""Oh, it is you, is it?"" said little Rose. ""Mamma read to us yesterday"
15643,THORNS.,that perfume was the soul of flowers. I guess you have got the biggest
15644,THORNS.,"soul of them all, if you are so little."""
15645,THORNS.,
15646,THORNS.,Pretty soon Rose began to think of something more substantial than
15647,THORNS.,"bird-songs, sunbeams and flowers. There were very nice raspberries,"
15648,THORNS.,"red and ripe, over beyond the currant-bushes, and her mamma allowed"
15649,THORNS.,"her to pick them in that part of the garden, for she knew how"
15650,THORNS.,delightful it is for little folks to eat their fruit just where they
15651,THORNS.,pick it from the bushes.
15652,THORNS.,
15653,THORNS.,"Little Rose went around into the lower walk, where she could see the"
15654,THORNS.,"raspberries. A good many had ripened over-night, and hung on the long,"
15655,THORNS.,"waving stems, waiting to be picked."
15656,THORNS.,
15657,THORNS.,"There was a short way to them, right across between two great"
15658,THORNS.,branching currant-bushes. She saw it was guarded by long briar-stalks
15659,THORNS.,"with sharp thorns all along their sides, but it was so much nearer"
15660,THORNS.,"than to go around the long row of currants. ""Mamma says we must not be"
15661,THORNS.,"afraid of trials and discouragements in our way,"" Rose said. She was"
15662,THORNS.,"very fond of quoting things she heard said or read, and applying them"
15663,THORNS.,to her own experience.
15664,THORNS.,
15665,THORNS.,"""I guess I can get through. Little girls must be brave!"" And she"
15666,THORNS.,pushed boldly into the middle of the space between the bushes. But
15667,THORNS.,"there she caught fast, and could not go a step farther. One great,"
15668,THORNS.,"strong branch of thorns was stretched across her foot, the sharp"
15669,THORNS.,"points sticking fast in her stocking, and hurting her flesh cruelly if"
15670,THORNS.,she tried to move it. Another one caught hold of her little
15671,THORNS.,garden-shawl and pulled it away back off her shoulders. She pulled and
15672,THORNS.,"twitched with all her might, but could not get it loose. On the other"
15673,THORNS.,"side her little bare elbow was torn and bleeding from a scratch, while"
15674,THORNS.,her dress was held as fast as if a hundred invisible hands were
15675,THORNS.,pulling at it. There she was. She could not get on nor back. There was
15676,THORNS.,nothing to be done but to call for her mother. This she did so loudly
15677,THORNS.,that everybody in the house came rushing to see what was the matter.
15678,THORNS.,"Dolly and Hannah, leaving their dish-washing in the kitchen, got there"
15679,THORNS.,"first, and setting to work soon had Rose out, but with scratched"
15680,THORNS.,"hands, arms and feet and two great rents in her dress."
15681,THORNS.,
15682,THORNS.,"""How in the world did you come in there among the briars?"" asked"
15683,THORNS.,"mamma, after they were in the house again and Rose became comforted a"
15684,THORNS.,little.
15685,THORNS.,
15686,THORNS.,"""It was the nearest way to the raspberries,"" she answered."
15687,THORNS.,
15688,THORNS.,"""The nearest? Yes; but not the best. It would have been far better to"
15689,THORNS.,"go around by the path."""
15690,THORNS.,
15691,THORNS.,"""I heard you tell Cousin Lucy the other day that folks must never mind"
15692,THORNS.,"if there were thorns in their way,"" said little Rose, almost sobbing"

15919,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,was decided that all Miss Walters might tell them concerning the
15920,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"flowers should be written down, for the benefit of all, as they were"

15923,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"In the next meadow they came upon beds of Menyanthes--an ugly name,"
15924,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,and its common one of buck-bean is not much better. They could find

15934,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,On the edge of an overgrown ditch near by they found very nice

15939,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"named after Andromeda, famed in Grecian myths, a victim to her"
15940,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,mother's pride of beauty. Her mother had dared to compare herself to
15941,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"the sea nymphs, for which they, enraged, sent a huge monster to ravage"
15942,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"the coast. To appease the nymphs, her father thought he must sacrifice"
15943,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,his daughter; so he chained her to the water's edge; but as the
15944,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"monster approached, Perseus, assisted by the gods, killed him,"
15945,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"delivered Andromeda, and afterwards married her."""
15946,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
15947,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,The party now turned from the meadows on to higher ground. Houstonias
15948,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"and violets, with here and there Potentilla, covered the ground, the"

15964,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
15965,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"About five o'clock they began their homeward walk, which took them"

15996,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,as he could do to pour the refreshing draughts.
15997,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
15998,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"The girls had little to do, the boys doing the honors in fine style."
15999,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,Very merry they grew over the good things; and so intent were they
16000,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"trying to sell the last at auction, that they never noticed a large"
16001,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"cloud that had overspread the sky, until a few drops of rain fell upon"
16002,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,the table.
16003,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16004,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""Here's a pretty go!"" said Fred. ""Run, Miss Walters; and, girls, get"
16005,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"into the cave, and we'll clear the tables."""

16008,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16009,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"Busy hands quickly disposed of all the articles to be kept dry, and"
16010,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,the boys were glad to get into the friendly shelter. Down came the
16011,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"rain, heavily rolled the thunder, and for a little while the lightning"
16012,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,was vivid. Soon the rain began to find its way into the cave.
16013,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16014,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""This will not do. Where's the table, Fred? We must have up a storm"

16016,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16017,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""All ready to slide right up,"" said Fred. ""Arthur, will you get the"

16019,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16020,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,Arthur crept on his hands and knees to a little crevice in the inner
16021,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"part of the cave, and drew out a tin box, with four holes in the"
16022,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"cover. The girls gathered around, and were much amused to see him take"
16023,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,out his four candles. These he stuck into the holes of the box; and
16024,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"lighting them, he placed them on a shelf prepared expressly for the"
16025,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,occasion.
16026,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16027,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,Never were boys and girls more happy. They were enjoying excitement
16028,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"without danger or discomfort. They sang, played games; and when the"
16029,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"rain had nearly ceased, some of the boys ran out and lighted the fire."
16030,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"They had kept the wood dry. Then turning the table on its side, they"
16031,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"put out the candles, and had the full benefit of the fire-light. For a"
16032,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,while conundrums were the order of the day; then they drew lots to
16033,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"determine who should tell the first story. It fell to Millie Gray,"
16034,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"who, with timid modesty, demurred; but the penalty threatened for"
16035,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"default was so great, that though she had never told a story in her"
16036,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"life, she thought she had better begin now. Attentively they listened,"
16037,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,waiting for her to begin. Presently she commenced.
16038,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16039,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""There was, once upon a time, a beautiful little girl, with blue eyes"

16049,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""Well, I like to oblige all parties,"" replied Millie. ""Suppose we say"

16057,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16058,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""Well, this little girl lived in a deep forest, in a little bit of a"

16128,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16129,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"""Don't go, don't go!"" came from a chorus of voices; and Miss Walters,"
16130,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"who only cared for their comfort, said she would stay if that was the"

16134,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,
16135,THE CAVE OF BENTON'S RIDGE.,"A song was proposed, and Miss W. led them in the sweet words of ""In"

16161,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,In crossing the forests which lie about that singular system of ponds
16162,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"and lakes that occupy the northern interior of the State of Maine, the"
16163,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"tourist and hunter will often come upon well-beaten paths, running"
16164,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"through the woods, trodden hard, as if by the passage of myriads of"
16165,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"feet; and this in a region rarely, or never, entered by man. They are"
16166,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the paths of wild beasts--bears, lynxes, wildcats, the moose, and the"
16167,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"carribou,--along which they pass from lake to lake, in pursuit of"
16168,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"their food, or upon hostile forays. When two lakes adjoin each other,"
16169,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"with no more than a mile or half a mile of forest between them, there"
16170,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"will nearly always be found, across the narrowest part of the isthmus,"
16171,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"a path of this sort, more or less worn, according as the locality"
16172,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"abounds with game, or the lakes with fish."
16173,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16174,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,[Illustration: THE GRIZZLY BEAR.]
16175,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16176,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"One of the widest and most used of these that I have ever seen, led"
16177,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"from the bank of Moose River up to the low shores of Holeb Pond, in"
16178,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,one of the not yet numbered townships near the Canada line--so near
16179,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"that the high, dingy summit of the ""Hog's Back"" was plainly visible to"
16180,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,the north-westward. Starting out from between two large boulders on
16181,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the stream, which at this point is broken by rips, it runs crooking"
16182,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"and turning amid clumps of hazel and alder, till lost to view in a"
16183,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"wide flat, covered with ""high bush"" cranberries, but lost to sight"
16184,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"only, however; for its tortuous course still continues beneath the"
16185,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"thick shrubs, until at a distance of two hundred rods it emerges on"
16186,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,the pond.
16187,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16188,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Happening to cross it a year ago last autumn, in company with Rod"
16189,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Nichols (my comrade on these tramps), the idea suggested itself that a"
16190,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,good thing might perhaps be done by setting our traps along the path.
16191,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"For where there were so many passing feet, some of them might without"
16192,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,doubt be entrapped.
16193,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16194,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Rod thought it was the ""beat"" of some bears, or ""lucivees,"" while I"
16195,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"inclined to the opinion that otters or ""fishers"" had made it."
16196,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16197,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"So we brought up our traps,--half a dozen small ones, which we used"
16198,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"for sable and otter--from the dug-out (canoe) down on the stream, and"
16199,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,during the following afternoon set them at different points in the
16200,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"path, between the border of the cranberry flat and the river. Then"
16201,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"drawing our canoe up out of the water, we encamped on the stream about"
16202,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"a mile below the path, and waited for the game."
16203,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16204,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Our stock of deer meat had got out. We had to content ourselves, both"
16205,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"for supper and breakfast, the following morning, with a couple of"
16206,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,hares--lean as usual. Who ever saw a fat hare?
16207,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16208,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,Old hunters are always telling the young sportsman about the
16209,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,marvellous properties of shaving-soap made from hare's tallow and
16210,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,cedar ashes. The flesh has about as much taste and nutrition in it
16211,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"as--so much paper pulp, for want of a better comparison to express its"
16212,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,utter lack of flavor. But during the forenoon we managed to shoot four
16213,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"partridges. These we first parboiled in our camp kettle, then broiled"
16214,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,on coals. They made us a comfortable dinner; and towards sunset we
16215,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"again paddled up the stream, to visit the traps."
16216,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16217,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Coming near where the path strikes out from the river, we drew up the"
16218,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"dug-out, and followed in to the place where we had set the first trap."
16219,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"It was gone; but the grass about the spot was beaten down, and the"
16220,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"bushes broken. And on looking around, we discovered a trail leading"
16221,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"off through the weeds. Following this for ten or a dozen rods, we came"
16222,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"to a large, rough stone; and near it lay the trap, shattered and bent,"
16223,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"with the springs broken, and the jaws gaping and powerless. The stone,"
16224,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"too, looked newly scratched, as if from heavy blows. The trap had"
16225,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,evidently been beaten upon.
16226,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16227,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Some large animal,"" said I."
16228,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16229,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Bear, probably,"" said Rod. ""They will frequently smash up a small"
16230,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"trap to get it off their feet."""
16231,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16232,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Whatever it was, the creature had freed himself and gone. Rod picked"
16233,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"up the broken trap, and we went back, and on to the next."
16234,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16235,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,This one was just as we had placed it--not sprung. So we kept on to
16236,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the third, which was sprung, but empty, with little clots of hair"
16237,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"clinging to the teeth. The hair looked like that of a sable; but he,"
16238,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"too, had escaped."
16239,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16240,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,The fourth was sprung and drawn out of the path. We crept cautiously
16241,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"up, and lo! we had a contemptible little musquash (muskrat)--skin not"
16242,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,worth a shilling. He was busy as a bee gnawing at his leg. In a few
16243,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,minutes more he would have been at liberty--minus a foot. If left any
16244,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"length of time after being caught, they will frequently gnaw off the"
16245,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"leg in the trap. For this reason, those who make a business of"
16246,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"trapping them set their traps under water, well weighted. They will"
16247,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"then drown in a few moments, and may thus be secured."
16248,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16249,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,The last two traps were not sprung.
16250,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16251,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""A big thing this!"" muttered Rod. ""Had our labor for our pains. Too"
16252,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"bad."""
16253,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16254,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,We were near the edge of the cranberry flat; and just as Rod was
16255,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"bemoaning our poor luck, a slight crackling out in the thick cranberry"
16256,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,bushes came to our ears.
16257,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16258,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Hark!"" whispered Rod; ""something out there. The bear, perhaps."""
16259,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16260,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Standing on tiptoe, we peeped quietly over the tops of the bushes, now"
16261,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"laden with the green cranberries. Off some seventeen or eighteen rods,"
16262,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"something was slowly moving. We could see it plainly--something which,"
16263,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"at first sight, looked like the roots of an old dry pine stump, a"
16264,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,great mass of stubs and prongs.
16265,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16266,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""A moose!"" exclaimed Rod, in an eager whisper. ""A moose browsing the"
16267,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"cranberries! Quick with your rifle! Together now!"""
16268,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16269,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"We both fired. The huge animal, fully nine feet in height beneath his"
16270,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"antlers, bounded into the air at the reports, with a wild, hoarse cry,"
16271,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,which I can compare to nothing I have ever heard for hideousness. In a
16272,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"frightful way it resembled the neigh of a horse, or, rather, the loud"
16273,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"squeal of that animal when bitten or otherwise hurt--bounded up, then"
16274,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"fell, floundering and wallowing amid the cranberries, uttering"
16275,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,hideous moans.
16276,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16277,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"As quickly as we could for the thick and tangled bushes, we made our"
16278,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,way out towards the spot. The fearful struggles stilled as we drew
16279,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"near. Our aim, at so short a distance, had been thoroughly fatal. A"
16280,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"great opening in the bushes had been smashed down, in the midst of"
16281,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"which lay the moose, with its large nostrils dilated, gasping and"
16282,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"quivering. But its great ox eyes were set, and rapidly glazing. The"
16283,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,bushes were all besprinkled and drenched with blood. One bullet had
16284,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,struck and broken the skull into the brain; that was Rod's. Mine had
16285,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"gone into the breast, striking the lungs,--probably, from the profuse"
16286,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,bleeding.
16287,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16288,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""A pretty good shot!"" exclaimed Rod, looking upon the slaughter from a"
16289,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"purely business stand-point. ""Moosehide is always worth something. So"
16290,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,are those antlers. A noble set--aren't they? All of four feet broad
16291,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"across the top. Pretty heavy to lug; we can put them in the canoe,"
16292,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"though."""
16293,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16294,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Then there's the meat,"" said I."
16295,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16296,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""That's so,"" cried Rod, smacking his lips. ""No more rabbit's broth for"
16297,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"us at present. O, won't we have some grand moose steaks! Do you hear"
16298,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"that, old boy? How does that strike your fancy? Come, let's skin him,"
16299,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,and cut him up. I long to behold some of that surloin broiling! Rabbit
16300,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"meat, indeed!"" and Rod whipped out his hunting-knife, and fell upon"
16301,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,the carcass with the zeal of a hungry bald eagle.
16302,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16303,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,In a few minutes we had stripped off the skin. Rod then wrenched off
16304,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the antlers, cut out the muffle (the end of the nose), and also about"
16305,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,a hundred weight of what he considered the choicest of the meat. The
16306,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,rest of it--nine or ten hundred pounds--we could only leave where it
16307,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"had fallen. It would be of no use to us, so far from the settled"
16308,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,lands.
16309,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16310,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,[Illustration: THE TIGER.]
16311,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16312,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"To carry our spoils down to our canoe, we had to make two trips; for"
16313,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,the antlers alone were as much as one could take along at once. We had
16314,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,gone back after them and the hide.
16315,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16316,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Too bad,"" remarked Rod, ""to leave all this flesh here to rot above"
16317,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"ground."""
16318,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16319,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""I doubt if it be left to rot above ground,"" said I. ""There are too"
16320,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"many hungry mouths about for that."""
16321,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16322,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Right there,"" said Rod; ""and that makes me think we might use it to"
16323,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"lure them, and to bait our traps with. Drag it out to the path, and"
16324,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"set the traps round it."""
16325,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16326,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,The idea seemed a good one. So we cut the remains of the carcass in
16327,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"two. Whole it was too heavy to be moved. Then, fastening some stout"
16328,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"withes into them, we dragged the pieces, one after the other, out to"
16329,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the path, and left it at the place where the path entered the"
16330,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"cranberry bushes. This done, we set the traps about it,--the remaining"
16331,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"five,--and then went back to the canoe with the antlers and skin."
16332,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16333,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Made a very fair thing of it, after all,"" remarked Rod, as we floated"
16334,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"with the current down to our camp. ""Tell you what, old fellow, these"
16335,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,steaks are not to be sneezed at. More than ordinary pot luck just at
16336,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"this time."""
16337,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16338,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,It is needless to say that we fully satisfied our taste for venison
16339,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"that night, or that our breakfast next morning was merely a repetition"
16340,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,of supper. Such things are to be expected in the wilderness. Suffice
16341,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"it to add, that we neither overate nor overslept, but were up betimes,"
16342,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,and off to examine our traps considerably before sunrise. We did not
16343,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"go up in the canoe on the river, but walked along the bank through the"
16344,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,woods.
16345,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16346,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""We may surprise a bear or a lynx at the carcass,"" said Rod."
16347,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16348,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"So, as we drew near the place where we had left it in the path the"
16349,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"evening before, we made our way amid the brush with as little noise"
16350,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"as possible. A small hollow, overrun with hackmatack, led up towards"
16351,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the spot. We crept along the bed of it, in order to approach"
16352,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"unobserved. Pausing a moment to listen, the clank of a chain came"
16353,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"faintly to our ears, then a growling, worrying noise, heard when two"
16354,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"creatures, jealous of each other's rights, eat from the same piece."
16355,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16356,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Game!"" whispered Rod."
16357,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16358,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Climbing quietly up the steep side, we peeped out from amid the green"
16359,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,boughs. We had got up within nine or ten rods; but intervening bushes
16360,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"partially hid the carcass. Something was moving about it,"
16361,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,however--something black. The trap chains were rattling. Then a big
16362,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"black head was raised, to growl; and as if in reply came a sharp snarl"
16363,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,from some animal out of sight. The black creature darted forward; and
16364,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"a great uproar arose, growling, grappling, and spitting, at which"
16365,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"there flew up a whole flock of crows, cawing and hawing; and the noise"
16366,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"increasing, there sprang into the air, at a single flap, a great"
16367,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"yellow bird, uttering a savage scream."
16368,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16369,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""An eagle!"" whispered Rod; ""and that black creature's a bear, I guess."
16370,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Can't see him just plainly. Growls like one, though. Fighting with"
16371,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"some other animal--isn't he? Some sort of a cat, by the spitting."""
16372,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16373,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Shall we fire on them?"" said I."
16374,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16375,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""No; let 'em have it out,"" said Rod. ""One of them will be pretty sure"
16376,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"to get chewed up, and the other won't leave the carcass. Besides, the"
16377,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"cat's in the trap, I reckon, by the rattling."" For the jingling of the"
16378,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,chain could still be heard over the howling they were making. But ere
16379,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"the fight had lasted many seconds, a suppressed screech, followed by a"
16380,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"crunching sound, told ill for one or the other of the combatants. ""The"
16381,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"cat's got his death hug,"" muttered Rod."
16382,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16383,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Presently the bear--a great, clumsy-looking fellow--came out into"
16384,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"view, strutted along, scrubbing his feet on the grass, like a dog, and"
16385,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,went back to the carcass. The eagle and the crows had come back to it.
16386,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,They flew before him.
16387,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16388,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Keep your eye on the eagle,"" whispered Rod. ""I would like to get him."
16389,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"It isn't a 'white head.' Never saw one like it."""
16390,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16391,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"The great bird circled slowly several times, then stooped, almost"
16392,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,touching the bear's shaggy back with its hooked talons. At that the
16393,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"bear raised his ugly muzzle, all reeking from his feast, and growled"
16394,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"menacingly. This was repeated several times, the bear warning him off"
16395,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"at each stoop, and sometimes striking with his big paw. Finding the"
16396,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"bear not inclined to divide with him, the eagle, with one mighty flap"
16397,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"of his wings, rose up to the top of a tall hemlock standing near, and"
16398,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,perched upon it. We could see the branches bend and sway beneath his
16399,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,weight.
16400,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16401,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""I'll have him now,"" muttered Rod, poking the muzzle of his rifle out"
16402,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"through the boughs. ""You take the bear. Ready! now!"""
16403,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16404,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,We blazed away. With a wild shriek the eagle came tumbling down
16405,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"through the hemlock. Rod ran out towards him, and I made up to the"
16406,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,bear. Old Bruin was merely wounded--an ugly flesh wound; and not
16407,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"knowing whence it came, he had flown at the dead lynx,--for such it"
16408,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"turned out to be,--and was giving him another hugging. Seeing me, he"
16409,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"started up, to rectify his mistake, probably; but I had put in another"
16410,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"charge, and instantly gave him a quietus. Just then Rod came up,"
16411,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,dragging the eagle.
16412,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16413,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"""Never saw one like it,"" exclaimed he. ""I mean to take it down to"
16414,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Greenville."""
16415,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,
16416,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"After skinning the bear and the lynx, we gathered up the traps, and"
16417,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"went down to our camp. Together with the spoils of the moose, we had"
16418,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"now a full canoe load, and stowing them in, went down the river that"
16419,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"afternoon. Two days after, we arrived at Greenville, at the foot of"
16420,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,Moosehead Lake. There we fell in with a party of tourists--from
16421,THE HAUNTS OF WILD BEASTS.,"Boston, I believe. They pronounced Rod's ""big bird"" to be a golden"

16448,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Tired of the heat and confusion of the city, my friend Clarke and I"
16449,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,left New York one fine morning for a hunting excursion on the
16450,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,prairies.
16451,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16452,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"At Galena, on the Mississippi, we went aboard a steamer which conveyed"
16453,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"us to St. Paul. Here we fitted out for the trip, and finally, at Sauk"
16454,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,Rapids set our foot for the first time on the prairie.
16455,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16456,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"From the Mississippi, at Sauk Rapids, we struck about north-west"
16457,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"across the prairie for Fort Garry, a Hudson Bay Company's fort, at the"
16458,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"junction of the Assiniboine and Red River, where we replenished some"
16459,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"of our stores; and thence we travelled through the Sioux, or Da-ko-tah"
16460,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"country, until we reached Turtle Mountain."
16461,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16462,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Our party consisted of Clarke and myself, two French Canadians, whom"
16463,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"we had engaged at St. Paul, and a half-breed, whom we had met on the"
16464,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,frontier before reaching Fort Garry.
16465,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16466,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"One evening, before camping at the base of Turtle Mountain, Clarke and"
16467,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"I gave chase to some buffalo, and I killed one, which I proceeded to"
16468,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,cut up at once by removing the tongue and undercut of the fillet. The
16469,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"meat I tied to the thongs of my saddle, placed there especially for"
16470,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"that purpose, and I rejoined the camp before nightfall. Clarke came"
16471,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"back shortly afterwards, having killed his buffalo in three or four"
16472,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"shots, and after a long chase. This had delayed him so much, that he"
16473,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,lacked time to cut up his animal; so he marked the spot as well as he
16474,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"could by its bearings with Turtle Mountain, and he rode homewards to"
16475,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"the camp, intending to go on the following morning, and get the meat"
16476,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,for home consumption.
16477,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16478,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"We cooked and ate our dinners, and rolling ourselves up in our buffalo"
16479,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"robes, we slept most soundly. The following morning, Clarke went out"
16480,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"and fetched his pony, which was picketed near the camp, saddled it,"
16481,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"took his rifle and hunting-knife, and then off he started to look for"
16482,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"the dead buffalo of the previous evening, cut it up, and bring home"
16483,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,some of the meat.
16484,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16485,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,I remained in camp; and as my wardrobe was rather dilapidated from
16486,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"constant hunting, and the limited number of clothes I had with me, I"
16487,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"proceeded to mend my trousers, which were worn through just where it"
16488,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,might naturally be expected they would first give way. This I could
16489,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"only do by shortening the legs of the garment. However, the end"
16490,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,justified the means in this case.
16491,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16492,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"These repairs, with other necessary work about our rifles and guns,"
16493,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,occupied the morning very pleasantly; and about midday I went up the
16494,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"hill behind our camp, where a small bluff, or headland, projected from"
16495,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"it over the vast grassy plain. I took my telescope with me, as every"
16496,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"traveller in those wild regions should always do, when spying out"
16497,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,either the fatness of the land or the possible surrounding dangers.
16498,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Far and wide my eye fell over the gentle undulations of the prairie,"
16499,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,but no deer or buffalo could I see.
16500,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16501,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"No; instead of quietly feeding game, I discovered my friend Clarke,"
16502,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"some three or four miles from camp, galloping at the top of his"
16503,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"horse's speed towards us, and five Indians in hot pursuit of him."
16504,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16505,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Knowing his danger, I of course ran down the bluff as hard as I could"
16506,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"to the camp, and holloaed to the men to make haste and come to the"
16507,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"rescue. I then ran for my pony, which was picketed at a short distance"
16508,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"from our tent; but he was difficult to catch, or had drawn his peg out"
16509,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"of the ground. At any rate, I could not get hold of him; so I gave"
16510,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"him up, and seizing my rifle, darted off as hard as I could to meet my"
16511,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,friend.
16512,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16513,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,[Illustration: {Clarke being pursued by the Indians}]
16514,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16515,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,The men also turned out with their guns; and soon afterwards Clarke
16516,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"rode up, both he and his pony looking much distressed. Clarke was as"
16517,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"white as a sheet, and his pony was completely blown. The Indians"
16518,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,sheered off on seeing us ready with our rifles. So no shot was fired;
16519,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,for they never came within range.
16520,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16521,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,I then asked Clarke what had happened; and I give you his story of the
16522,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,affair.
16523,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16524,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"On leaving camp in the morning, he had gone in search of the dead"
16525,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,buffalo of the previous night. He soon found the carcass; and wishing
16526,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"to bring home the meat, he got off his pony, tied the animal to the"
16527,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"horns of the buffalo,--as you are always taught to do in the Indian"
16528,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"country,--and straightway began to cut off the pieces of meat which he"
16529,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"wished to bring back to camp. Whilst so employed, he thought he saw"
16530,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,another herd of buffalo not far away; so he finished cutting off the
16531,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"meat, and rode towards the new herd, on murderous thoughts intent."
16532,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16533,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"He stalked the herd for some distance, until he thought himself"
16534,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"tolerably near, when he looked round the corner of a hillock, and then"
16535,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"to his horror found he had been carefully approaching five Indians,"
16536,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"who were congregated round a dead buffalo, their horses close by, and"
16537,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,the men occupied in cutting up the beast.
16538,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16539,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,Before he could turn to flee out of sight the Indians discovered him.
16540,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"They were Sioux, and at war with the whites. Instantly they jumped on"
16541,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"their horses and gave chase, fired, no doubt, with the noble zeal to"
16542,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,hang a white scalp in a Sioux lodge. Off went Clarke as hard as his
16543,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"little pony could carry him, the Indians shouting behind, and"
16544,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"brandishing their guns in the air as they became excited by the chase,"
16545,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,whilst he was thinking of the probability that existed of his scalp
16546,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"returning to camp, or dangling at the saddle-bow of one of these"
16547,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,bloodthirsty savages.
16548,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16549,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,Clarke supposes that he was five or six miles from camp when the chase
16550,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"began; and he recollected well throwing the cover away from his rifle,"
16551,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"in preparation for a fight should his pony fall, or the Indians catch"
16552,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,him through the superior speed of their animals.
16553,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16554,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,Imagine the horrible feelings of a young fellow galloping away from
16555,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"five wild redskins, who not only desire to kill him then and there,"
16556,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"but have, further, the sportsman-like anxiety to strip his scalp, and"
16557,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"hang the dearly-beloved trophy in some filthy lodge, where it will"

16562,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Their horrible shrieks ring in his ears, whilst he anxiously measures"
16563,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,with his eyes the distance betwixt himself and his bloodthirsty
16564,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"pursuers; he endeavors to estimate his chances of escape, and longs"
16565,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"for the protection of the camp, as Wellington longed for night or"
16566,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"Blucher, knowing that if he falls he will be shot, or tomahawked and"
16567,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"scalped, in the course of a couple of minutes."
16568,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,
16569,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"No wonder, then, that poor Clarke did look as if he had seen a ghost,"
16570,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,or encountered something even much worse; nor do I believe that during
16571,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,his subsequent army service he was ever much nearer a horrible death
16572,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,than during the few minutes which that pursuit lasted.

16574,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"To conclude the account of this adventure, we covered his return to"
16575,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"camp with our rifles, as I mentioned in the earlier part of this"
16576,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,story; and you may conceive that we kept a very strict watch in the
16577,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"camp during the night, fearing lest the Sioux should either stampede"
16578,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"us with an increased number of their friends after nightfall, or try"
16579,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"to carry off our horses, and leave us deserted in the midst of the"
16580,A HUNTING ADVENTURE.,"prairie. However, the night passed off quietly; and often since then"

16600,NEARLY LOST.,
16601,NEARLY LOST.,"""I know what I shall do!"" exclaimed Walter Harrison to about a dozen"
16602,NEARLY LOST.,"other boys, his schoolfellows, who were standing round him. ""I shall"
16603,NEARLY LOST.,just tell 'old Barnacles' that my father and mother wish me to have a
16604,NEARLY LOST.,"holiday this afternoon, and he can't say 'no' to that. It's the"
16605,NEARLY LOST.,"simplest and best way. If you all agree to it, we shall get a holiday"
16606,NEARLY LOST.,"all around. Who'll go in for my plan?"""
16607,NEARLY LOST.,
16608,NEARLY LOST.,"""I will! and I! and I!"" responded nearly all the boys."
16609,NEARLY LOST.,
16610,NEARLY LOST.,The facts of the case were simply these: There were taking place in a
16611,NEARLY LOST.,"park close by a series of athletic sports, and this afternoon the"
16612,NEARLY LOST.,admission was free to any one who chose to go. Of course all the boys
16613,NEARLY LOST.,in Mr. Jackson's school were mad to see the sports; but by the time
16614,NEARLY LOST.,"the school was out the best fun would be over, and the majority of the"
16615,NEARLY LOST.,boys guessed pretty shrewdly what would be the result of asking their
16616,NEARLY LOST.,parents to let them stay away. The grand idea was to induce the master
16617,NEARLY LOST.,"to give a general holiday, but the question was how that desirable end"
16618,NEARLY LOST.,"was to be brought about. It had been suggested to stay away bodily,"
16619,NEARLY LOST.,"without so much as saying, ""With your leave or by your leave;"" but as"
16620,NEARLY LOST.,"such a course carried a certainty of punishment in its train, it was"
16621,NEARLY LOST.,"universally rejected. Another idea, which had received some favor, had"
16622,NEARLY LOST.,"been to trip up the poor half-blind schoolmaster, quite by accident,"
16623,NEARLY LOST.,"and by rendering him incapable obtain the desired holiday, but there"
16624,NEARLY LOST.,had been a majority found to protest against such cruelty; and now
16625,NEARLY LOST.,Walter Harrison had suggested his plan. But although most of them were
16626,NEARLY LOST.,"inclined to adopt it, there were two who resolutely refused to do so."
16627,NEARLY LOST.,
16628,NEARLY LOST.,"""Why won't you join us?"" asked Walter of these two."
16629,NEARLY LOST.,
16630,NEARLY LOST.,"""I sha'n't, because I'm not going to tell a pack of lies for the sake"
16631,NEARLY LOST.,"of a holiday,"" answered Willie Ford, the younger of the two."
16632,NEARLY LOST.,
16633,NEARLY LOST.,"""How good we are!"" replied Walter, tauntingly; and then throwing his"
16634,NEARLY LOST.,"cap up into the air, he sang out:"
16635,NEARLY LOST.,
16636,NEARLY LOST.,"""'There was a curly-headed boy"
16637,NEARLY LOST.,Who never told a lie;
16638,NEARLY LOST.,He knew a trick worth two of that:
16639,NEARLY LOST.,That was the reason why.'
16640,NEARLY LOST.,
16641,NEARLY LOST.,"""Sly fox!"" he said, patting Willie on the back. ""He does the 'good'"
16642,NEARLY LOST.,"dodge to perfection, and finds it answers too; don't you, Ford?"""
16643,NEARLY LOST.,
16644,NEARLY LOST.,Walter's sallies were received with roars of laughter by the boys.
16645,NEARLY LOST.,"Willie took no notice of them, although it was a difficult matter to"
16646,NEARLY LOST.,restrain his anger.
16647,NEARLY LOST.,
16648,NEARLY LOST.,"""What a milksop the fellow is!"" cried out one of the boys."
16649,NEARLY LOST.,
16650,NEARLY LOST.,"""A stupid little muff!"" cried another."
16651,NEARLY LOST.,
16652,NEARLY LOST.,"""Am I?"" cried Willie, his temper now fully roused; ""I'll show you"
16653,NEARLY LOST.,"about that. Although I'm not going to tell lies, I'll fight any one of"
16654,NEARLY LOST.,"you. Come now, Harrison, let's have it out together."""
16655,NEARLY LOST.,
16656,NEARLY LOST.,"Harrison burst out laughing: ""Fancy me fighting with a little"
16657,NEARLY LOST.,"cock-sparrow like you! I should like to see myself!"""
16658,NEARLY LOST.,
16659,NEARLY LOST.,"Willie was about to burst out again, but a friendly hand was laid on"
16660,NEARLY LOST.,"his arm, and his friend Philip said, gently, ""Come away, Will; no"
16661,NEARLY LOST.,"fighting about such a trifle as that, lad."""
16662,NEARLY LOST.,
16663,NEARLY LOST.,"""What a peppery little chap!"" called out Walter as Willie turned away"
16664,NEARLY LOST.,"with his friend. ""Pepper and sop! Ugh! what a nasty mess!"""
16665,NEARLY LOST.,
16666,NEARLY LOST.,"The boys followed out their plan, and got their holiday, all except"
16667,NEARLY LOST.,Willie and Philip and several little fellows who had taken no interest
16668,NEARLY LOST.,in the matter.
16669,NEARLY LOST.,
16670,NEARLY LOST.,"School over, the two boys rushed off in the hope that they might be in"
16671,NEARLY LOST.,"time to see something. They were too late, however, for the"
16672,NEARLY LOST.,"performances were just coming to an end when they arrived, so they"
16673,NEARLY LOST.,"started for a stroll through the beautiful park, which was not often"
16674,NEARLY LOST.,open to the public.
16675,NEARLY LOST.,
16676,NEARLY LOST.,"""Why, there are our fellows!"" said Philip as they suddenly came in"
16677,NEARLY LOST.,sight of a group of boys on the edge of the magnificent lake.
16678,NEARLY LOST.,
16679,NEARLY LOST.,"""What are they up to? They're very busy about something!"" exclaimed"
16680,NEARLY LOST.,Willie.
16681,NEARLY LOST.,
16682,NEARLY LOST.,"""Let's go and see,"" Philip said, in reply."
16683,NEARLY LOST.,
16684,NEARLY LOST.,As they came nearer they could tell that the boys were gesticulating
16685,NEARLY LOST.,and shouting to something in the water.
16686,NEARLY LOST.,
16687,NEARLY LOST.,"""It can't be one of them gone in and lost his depth,"" said Willie,"
16688,NEARLY LOST.,anxiously.
16689,NEARLY LOST.,
16690,NEARLY LOST.,"No such thing, as they found when they got close--only a dog that the"
16691,NEARLY LOST.,boys were amusing themselves by seeing how long they could keep under
16692,NEARLY LOST.,water. The creature was making frantic efforts to gain a
16693,NEARLY LOST.,"landing-place, but as he approached the shore they drove him back with"
16694,NEARLY LOST.,sticks and stones.
16695,NEARLY LOST.,
16696,NEARLY LOST.,"""We're teaching him to swim,"" cried one as Philip and Willie came up."
16697,NEARLY LOST.,"""A miserable little mongrel! he can't swim a bit!"""
16698,NEARLY LOST.,
16699,NEARLY LOST.,"""Why, don't you see,"" cried Willie, eagerly, ""that he's as weak as a"
16700,NEARLY LOST.,rat? He can scarcely support himself in the water. I should think he's
16701,NEARLY LOST.,"been starved."""
16702,NEARLY LOST.,
16703,NEARLY LOST.,"At this moment the dog, being turned back once more, disappeared,"
16704,NEARLY LOST.,"quite close to the shore. With a loud cry of pain and anger, Willie"
16705,NEARLY LOST.,"darted through the boys, and wading into the shallow water succeeded"
16706,NEARLY LOST.,"in enticing the drowning dog toward him. He came out, holding the"
16707,NEARLY LOST.,dripping creature safely in his arms.
16708,NEARLY LOST.,
16709,NEARLY LOST.,"""We must carry it home,"" he said to Philip, after they had vainly"
16710,NEARLY LOST.,"endeavored to set it upon its feet; and accordingly, they started off"
16711,NEARLY LOST.,"at a good pace, the poor half-drowned animal safely sheltered in"
16712,NEARLY LOST.,Willie's arms.
16713,NEARLY LOST.,
16714,NEARLY LOST.,Well might his mother be alarmed to see him come home to tea in such a
16715,NEARLY LOST.,"plight; but when she heard his explanation, she was quite ready to"
16716,NEARLY LOST.,"sympathize with him, and told him he had done bravely and well to"
16717,NEARLY LOST.,"rescue the poor animal. As he seemed none the worse for his wetting,"
16718,NEARLY LOST.,he was allowed to come down stairs again as soon as he had put on dry
16719,NEARLY LOST.,things. Very tenderly the little half-starved dog was fed with warmed
16720,NEARLY LOST.,milk. He had fallen into good hands. Willie's father and mother were
16721,NEARLY LOST.,"kind Christian people, who had taught their children to be gentle and"
16722,NEARLY LOST.,considerate to the meanest of God's creatures.
16723,NEARLY LOST.,
16724,NEARLY LOST.,"""Why, Willie, he's a fine fellow, and only quite a puppy; he will be a"
16725,NEARLY LOST.,"splendid dog when he is fully grown,"" his father said, when the animal"
16726,NEARLY LOST.,had recovered sufficiently to be examined.
16727,NEARLY LOST.,
16728,NEARLY LOST.,"And so it proved. Bruno, as Willie named him, turned out a splendid"
16729,NEARLY LOST.,"creature. His devotion to the whole family, but especially to Willie,"
16730,NEARLY LOST.,was quite touching to see. He would obey the slightest gesture of his
16731,NEARLY LOST.,young master in every matter except one. As a child once burned dreads
16732,NEARLY LOST.,"the fire, so Bruno, once nearly drowned, could never be induced to"
16733,NEARLY LOST.,enter the water.
16734,NEARLY LOST.,
16735,NEARLY LOST.,"While Bruno was developing into a handsome dog, Willie, you may be"
16736,NEARLY LOST.,"sure, was not standing still. He had grown into a fine strong lad, and"
16737,NEARLY LOST.,got beyond poor old Dr. Jackson's school.
16738,NEARLY LOST.,
16739,NEARLY LOST.,To the last day of his stay there he and Walter Harrison never managed
16740,NEARLY LOST.,"to get on very good terms, and a suspected unfairness in the matter of"
16741,NEARLY LOST.,obtaining a prize made them part with still greater coldness.
16742,NEARLY LOST.,
16743,NEARLY LOST.,A year or two after he had left school Willie's parents went with
16744,NEARLY LOST.,their family to spend the summer months near the sea. Before they had
16745,NEARLY LOST.,"been in their new quarters many weeks, much to Willie's vexation and"
16746,NEARLY LOST.,"disappointment, he found that Walter and his parents were also staying"
16747,NEARLY LOST.,"in the same town, and quite close to him."
16748,NEARLY LOST.,
16749,NEARLY LOST.,"The two lads frequently met, but they could get on no better now than"
16750,NEARLY LOST.,they had done in the old days. Walter still looked upon Willie as a
16751,NEARLY LOST.,"contemptible little milksop, and Willie was inclined to consider"
16752,NEARLY LOST.,Walter's exploits more the result of foolhardiness than bravery.
16753,NEARLY LOST.,
16754,NEARLY LOST.,One day they met on the beach. Walter had come down with a friend to
16755,NEARLY LOST.,take a boat.
16756,NEARLY LOST.,
16757,NEARLY LOST.,"""Rather rough for rowing,"" Willie called out as he passed, ""but I"
16758,NEARLY LOST.,"suppose you're a good oar."""
16759,NEARLY LOST.,
16760,NEARLY LOST.,"""What's that to you?"" responded Walter, insolently; ""I suppose you're"
16761,NEARLY LOST.,"afraid of a little sea."""
16762,NEARLY LOST.,
16763,NEARLY LOST.,"""I don't see the pleasure of going out when there's any risk,"" Willie"
16764,NEARLY LOST.,"replied, good-humoredly."
16765,NEARLY LOST.,
16766,NEARLY LOST.,"""How precious careful you are over yourself!"" replied Walter."
16767,NEARLY LOST.,
16768,NEARLY LOST.,"The boat pushed off, and away started the two friends. Willie, not"
16769,NEARLY LOST.,"caring to watch them after the haughty, rude manner in which his"
16770,NEARLY LOST.,"remark had been received, turned away; but before he had gone far his"
16771,NEARLY LOST.,attention was attracted by a succession of shouts and ejaculations.
16772,NEARLY LOST.,
16773,NEARLY LOST.,The tiny boat had come to grief before they had got much more than
16774,NEARLY LOST.,fifty yards from the shore. In the unskilful hands of the two lads the
16775,NEARLY LOST.,little bark was a mere plaything in the angry sea. Carried on with a
16776,NEARLY LOST.,"swiftness they were unable to check, they rushed headlong on to one of"
16777,NEARLY LOST.,the hidden rocks with which the coast abounded. The boat turned over
16778,NEARLY LOST.,"and disappeared, leaving its occupants struggling in the water."
16779,NEARLY LOST.,
16780,NEARLY LOST.,"There were but few bystanders, and of these no one did more than talk"
16781,NEARLY LOST.,and gesticulate and ask wildly what was to be done.
16782,NEARLY LOST.,
16783,NEARLY LOST.,The same impulse that had prompted Willie to rescue a drowning dog
16784,NEARLY LOST.,now caused him to risk his life in order to save that of the boy who
16785,NEARLY LOST.,had always shown so unfriendly a disposition toward him.
16786,NEARLY LOST.,
16787,NEARLY LOST.,"Pulling off his coat, he threw it and his hat down on the shore; and"
16788,NEARLY LOST.,"giving Bruno an injunction to guard them, he plunged bravely into the"
16789,NEARLY LOST.,"tempestuous waves. He could swim well, and succeeded with great"
16790,NEARLY LOST.,difficulty in reaching the spot where Walter had but a moment ago
16791,NEARLY LOST.,"disappeared, and then began the terrible struggle for life."
16792,NEARLY LOST.,
16793,NEARLY LOST.,Bruno sat by his master's clothes and gazed out over the sea with eyes
16794,NEARLY LOST.,which looked almost human in their intelligent anxiety. Presently he
16795,NEARLY LOST.,"grew restless, and in another moment the faithful creature dashed into"
16796,NEARLY LOST.,"the waves, and made resolutely for the spot where his master was"
16797,NEARLY LOST.,laboriously engaged in trying to convey one of the drowning lads to
16798,NEARLY LOST.,shore.
16799,NEARLY LOST.,
16800,NEARLY LOST.,By the powerful aid of the noble dog Walter and Willie were saved; and
16801,NEARLY LOST.,"a boat having now put off, Walter's friend was picked up after a"
16802,NEARLY LOST.,while. What a cheer rent the air when the dog and the two lads gained
16803,NEARLY LOST.,the shore I cannot attempt to describe. Willie was never called a
16804,NEARLY LOST.,"milksop any more, and Bruno was more loved and prized than ever."

16811,CHARLEY.,CHARLEY.
16812,CHARLEY.,
16813,CHARLEY.,
16814,CHARLEY.,I made the acquaintance of my little friend Charley under very unusual
16815,CHARLEY.,and startling circumstances. I saw a lad about fifteen years of age
16816,CHARLEY.,clinging desperately for very life to the topmast of a sunken ship. I
16817,CHARLEY.,will tell you how it happened.
16818,CHARLEY.,
16819,CHARLEY.,"I must go back nearly twenty years. Indeed, I ought to explain that"
16820,CHARLEY.,Charley was a little friend of mine a long time ago; now he's a
16821,CHARLEY.,"grown-up man. Well, twenty years ago I was not very old myself, but my"
16822,CHARLEY.,"sister, who is some years older than I am, was already married, and"
16823,CHARLEY.,her husband was very fond of yachting. They lived during a great part
16824,CHARLEY.,"of the year in the Isle of Wight, and there I often used to go to stay"
16825,CHARLEY.,with them.
16826,CHARLEY.,
16827,CHARLEY.,"The ""Swallow""--that was the name of my brother-in-law's yacht--was a"
16828,CHARLEY.,"beautiful boat, and many happy hours have I passed on board her as she"
16829,CHARLEY.,"skimmed merrily over the sparkling water. I delighted to sit on deck,"
16830,CHARLEY.,"watching the fishing-boats as they rode bravely from wave to wave, or"
16831,CHARLEY.,"sometimes wondering at some large ship as it passed by, on which men"
16832,CHARLEY.,live for weeks and months without ever touching land. We used to sail
16833,CHARLEY.,"long distances, and occasionally be out for several days and nights"
16834,CHARLEY.,together. My brother-in-law's skipper could tell me what country
16835,CHARLEY.,almost every vessel that we saw was bound for. Some were sailing to
16836,CHARLEY.,climates where the heat is so great that our most sultry summer in
16837,CHARLEY.,"England is comparatively cold; others were off northward, perhaps"
16838,CHARLEY.,"whale-fishing, where they would see huge icebergs and hear the"
16839,CHARLEY.,growling of the polar bears.
16840,CHARLEY.,
16841,CHARLEY.,We were taking our last cruise of the season. It was already near the
16842,CHARLEY.,"end of October, and the weather was becoming stormy. Passing out of"
16843,CHARLEY.,"the Solent into the Channel, we found the sea much rougher than we"
16844,CHARLEY.,"expected, and as night came on it blew a regular gale. The wind and"
16845,CHARLEY.,"sea roared, the rain poured down in torrents, and the night seemed to"
16846,CHARLEY.,"me to be the darkest I had ever known. But on board the ""Swallow"" we"
16847,CHARLEY.,had no fear. We trusted to the seamanship of our skipper and the
16848,CHARLEY.,"goodness of our vessel, and went to bed with minds as free from fear"
16849,CHARLEY.,as if the sea were smooth and the sky clear.
16850,CHARLEY.,
16851,CHARLEY.,"I awoke just as dawn was breaking, dressed quickly, and throwing a"
16852,CHARLEY.,water-proof cloak over me popped my head up the companion-ladder to
16853,CHARLEY.,see how things looked. The old skipper was on deck; he had not turned
16854,CHARLEY.,"in during the night. I wished him good-morning, and he remarked, in"
16855,CHARLEY.,"return, that the wind was going down, he thought. Looking at the sea,"
16856,CHARLEY.,"I observed two or three large fragments of wood floating near, and"
16857,CHARLEY.,they attracted his notice at the same moment.
16858,CHARLEY.,
16859,CHARLEY.,"""Has there been a wreck, captain?"" I asked, with a feeling of awe."
16860,CHARLEY.,
16861,CHARLEY.,"""That's about what it is, miss,"" answered the old seaman."
16862,CHARLEY.,
16863,CHARLEY.,"""Do you think the people are drowned?"" I inquired, anxiously."
16864,CHARLEY.,
16865,CHARLEY.,"""Well,"" replied Captain Bounce, casting, as I thought, rather a"
16866,CHARLEY.,"contemptuous glance at me, ""people don't in general live under water,"
16867,CHARLEY.,"miss."""
16868,CHARLEY.,
16869,CHARLEY.,[Illustration: CHARLEY'S WELCOME HOME.]
16870,CHARLEY.,
16871,CHARLEY.,"""Perhaps they may have had boats,"" I said, meekly. ""Do you think"
16872,CHARLEY.,"boats could have reached the shore in such a storm?"""
16873,CHARLEY.,
16874,CHARLEY.,"""Well,"" answered the old captain, ""they might have had boats, and they"
16875,CHARLEY.,"mightn't; and the boats, supposing they had 'em, might have lived"
16876,CHARLEY.,"through the storm, and at the same time they mightn't."""
16877,CHARLEY.,
16878,CHARLEY.,"This was not giving me much information, and I thought to myself that"
16879,CHARLEY.,my friend the skipper did not seem so much inclined for a chat as
16880,CHARLEY.,"usual. I turned to look at the sea in search of more pieces of wreck,"
16881,CHARLEY.,when I discovered in the distance a dark speck rising out of the
16882,CHARLEY.,"water. I pointed it out to the skipper at once, who took his glass out"
16883,CHARLEY.,"of his pocket, and after looking through it for a moment exclaimed,"
16884,CHARLEY.,
16885,CHARLEY.,"""There's something floating there, and a man clinging to it, as I'm"
16886,CHARLEY.,"alive!"""
16887,CHARLEY.,
16888,CHARLEY.,"As he spoke my brother-in-law came on deck, and also took a look"
16889,CHARLEY.,"through the telescope. Then he, the captain and every sailor on board"
16890,CHARLEY.,became eager and excited. You would have thought it some dear friend
16891,CHARLEY.,of each whose life was to be saved. The yacht was headed in the
16892,CHARLEY.,"direction of the object, the boat was quickly lowered, the captain"
16893,CHARLEY.,"himself, with four sailors, jumping into it, and in another minute"
16894,CHARLEY.,they caught in their arms a poor little exhausted and fainting boy as
16895,CHARLEY.,he dropped from the mast of a large sunken ship. We could now
16896,CHARLEY.,"distinguish the tops of all the three masts appearing above the waves,"
16897,CHARLEY.,"for the sea was not deep, and the ship had settled down in an upright"
16898,CHARLEY.,position.
16899,CHARLEY.,
16900,CHARLEY.,"Poor Charley Standish was soon in the cabin of the yacht, and after"
16901,CHARLEY.,swallowing some champagne he revived sufficiently to tell us his
16902,CHARLEY.,"story. The sunken ship was the ""Melbourne,"" bound for Australia, and"
16903,CHARLEY.,this was Charley's first voyage as a midshipman on board. During the
16904,CHARLEY.,darkness of the night she had been run into by a large homeward-bound
16905,CHARLEY.,merchantman of the same class. She sank within an hour of the
16906,CHARLEY.,collision. In the scramble for the boats Charley thought he had but
16907,CHARLEY.,little chance for finding a place; and as the ship filled and kept
16908,CHARLEY.,"sinking deeper in the water, an instinct of self-preservation led him"
16909,CHARLEY.,"to climb into the rigging. Then up he went, higher and higher, even to"
16910,CHARLEY.,"the topmast; and at last, when the vessel went down all at once, he"
16911,CHARLEY.,"found himself, to his inexpressible relief, still above the surface."
16912,CHARLEY.,
16913,CHARLEY.,What most astonished us all was that a boy so young should have been
16914,CHARLEY.,"able to hold on for more than an hour to a slippery mast, exposed to"
16915,CHARLEY.,"the fury of the wind, and within reach, even, of the lashing waves. We"
16916,CHARLEY.,"sailed home at once to the Isle of Wight, and wrote to the boy's"
16917,CHARLEY.,"mother, a widow living in London, to tell her of his safety. The boy"
16918,CHARLEY.,"himself stayed with us two or three days, until we bought him new"
16919,CHARLEY.,"clothes, and then went to his mother. Great was her joy when she once"
16920,CHARLEY.,more clasped him to her loving heart. My brother-in-law took a great
16921,CHARLEY.,"fancy to him. He has watched his career, and seen him at intervals"
16922,CHARLEY.,ever since. Charley Standish is now a chief mate on board a great
16923,CHARLEY.,"merchantman of the same class as the ""Melbourne."""

16931,THE PARSEES.,"The Parsees are supposed to be descendants of the ancient Persians,"
16932,THE PARSEES.,"who, after the defeat of their King Yezdezerd, the last of the dynasty"
16933,THE PARSEES.,"of Sassan, by the followers of Mohammed, fled to the mountains of"
16934,THE PARSEES.,"Khorasan. On the death of Yezdezerd, they quitted their native land,"
16935,THE PARSEES.,"and putting to sea, were permitted to settle at Sanjan, a place near"
16936,THE PARSEES.,"the sea-coast, between Bombay and Surat, about twenty-four miles south"
16937,THE PARSEES.,of Damaun.
16938,THE PARSEES.,
16939,THE PARSEES.,"The Parsees are now chiefly settled in Bombay, numbering about one"
16940,THE PARSEES.,"hundred and fifteen thousand souls, or one fifth of the population."
16941,THE PARSEES.,
16942,THE PARSEES.,"The most enterprising, in a commercial point of view, of the various"
16943,THE PARSEES.,"races of Bombay, are the Parsees, some of whom are even more wealthy"
16944,THE PARSEES.,than the most successful of the European merchants. They bear the very
16945,THE PARSEES.,"highest character for honesty and industry, and are intelligent and"
16946,THE PARSEES.,benevolent. The late Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy was a faultless model of
16947,THE PARSEES.,"a merchant prince, in integrity, enterprise, and munificence. He"
16948,THE PARSEES.,"founded a hospital that bears his name, and made himself conspicuous"
16949,THE PARSEES.,for his active benevolence up to the day of his death.
16950,THE PARSEES.,
16951,THE PARSEES.,Great numbers of the poorer Parsees are clerks in the government
16952,THE PARSEES.,"offices--a species of service for which they are peculiarly fitted, on"
16953,THE PARSEES.,"account of their attention to business, industry, and general"
16954,THE PARSEES.,intelligence. Their inclinations are essentially pacific; and such a
16955,THE PARSEES.,phenomenon as a Parsee soldier is almost unknown.
16956,THE PARSEES.,
16957,THE PARSEES.,The Parsees are alive to the advantage of affording a good education
16958,THE PARSEES.,to their children; and among the largest seminaries in the city of
16959,THE PARSEES.,Bombay are those belonging to this community. A Parsee school is an
16960,THE PARSEES.,interesting sight. The children are decidedly pretty; and as they sit
16961,THE PARSEES.,"in rows, with glittering, many-colored dresses, and caps and jewels,"
16962,THE PARSEES.,they look like a gay parterre of flowers.
16963,THE PARSEES.,
16964,THE PARSEES.,"On account of their peculiar religious belief, the Parsees are known"
16965,THE PARSEES.,"also as ""Fire Worshippers;"" but however great their awe for fire and"
16966,THE PARSEES.,"light, they consider them only as emblems of a higher power. The"
16967,THE PARSEES.,"Parsees pay reverence to two kinds of fire--the Adaran, lawful for the"
16968,THE PARSEES.,"people to behold; and the Behram, which must be seen by none but the"
16969,THE PARSEES.,"chief Dustoor, or priest, and must be screened from the rays of the"
16970,THE PARSEES.,"sun. When required for a new temple, a portion of the sacred fire is"
16971,THE PARSEES.,"procured in a golden censer from Mount Elbourg, near Yezd, where"
16972,THE PARSEES.,"resides the chief pontiff, and where the holy flame is perpetually"
16973,THE PARSEES.,maintained. The Behram fire is said to have had its origin from the
16974,THE PARSEES.,"natural bituminous fires on the shores of the Caspian, and to have"
16975,THE PARSEES.,never been extinguished. It is supposed to be fed with sandal and
16976,THE PARSEES.,"other precious and aromatic woods, and is kept burning on a silver"
16977,THE PARSEES.,grating.
16978,THE PARSEES.,
16979,THE PARSEES.,The Parsees are the only Eastern nation who abstain from smoking. They
16980,THE PARSEES.,"do not eat food cooked by a person of another religion, and object to"
16981,THE PARSEES.,beef and pork.
16982,THE PARSEES.,
16983,THE PARSEES.,"When a Parsee dies, a dog must be present, as it is supposed to drive"
16984,THE PARSEES.,"away evil spirits, who are on the alert to seize upon the dying man's"
16985,THE PARSEES.,"soul. This precaution is called the _sagdad_, or dog-gaze. One of the"
16986,THE PARSEES.,chief reasons for the great veneration in which dogs are held by
16987,THE PARSEES.,Parsees arises from the tradition that in their emigration from Persia
16988,THE PARSEES.,"to India their ancestors were, during a dark night, nearly driven upon"
16989,THE PARSEES.,"the shores of Guzerat, and that they were aroused and first warned"
16990,THE PARSEES.,of their impending danger by the barking of the dogs on board their
16991,THE PARSEES.,ships.

16995,THE PARSEES.,"When a Parsee dies, the body is dressed in clean, but old clothes, and"
16996,THE PARSEES.,conveyed to its last resting-place on an iron bier; meat and drink are
16997,THE PARSEES.,"placed at hand for three days, as during that time the soul is"
16998,THE PARSEES.,supposed to hover around in the hope of being reunited to its late
16999,THE PARSEES.,earthly tenement.

17003,THE PARSEES.,The Parsee sepulchres are of so peculiar a character as to merit
17004,THE PARSEES.,"particular notice. Should any of my readers ever go to Bombay, he will"
17005,THE PARSEES.,"find two of these _dakhmas_, or Temples of Silence, in a secluded part"
17006,THE PARSEES.,"of Malabar Hill, though admittance is denied within the walls"
17007,THE PARSEES.,enclosing the melancholy structures to aught but Parsees. The interior
17008,THE PARSEES.,"is fitted up with stages or stories of stone pavement, slanting down"
17009,THE PARSEES.,"to a circular opening, like a well, covered with a grating, into which"
17010,THE PARSEES.,"the bones are swept, after the fowls of the air, the dew, and the sun"
17011,THE PARSEES.,have deprived them of every particle of flesh.
17012,THE PARSEES.,
17013,THE PARSEES.,"The Parsees assign as their reason for not burying their dead, that,"
17014,THE PARSEES.,"having received many benefits from the earth during their lifetime,"
17015,THE PARSEES.,"they consider it defiled by placing dead bodies in it. Similarly, they"
17016,THE PARSEES.,"do not adopt the Hindoo custom of burning their dead, as another"
17017,THE PARSEES.,"element, fire, would be rendered impure."
17018,THE PARSEES.,
17019,THE PARSEES.,"The chief distinctive feature of the Parsee dress is the hat, to which"
17020,THE PARSEES.,"the community cling with a pertinacity that would be extraordinary,"
17021,THE PARSEES.,"were it not common. Even the Parsee representative of ""Young Bombay,"""
17022,THE PARSEES.,"dressed from top to toe in European costume, including a pair of shiny"
17023,THE PARSEES.,"boots, cannot be induced to discard the abominable _topee_, or hat,"
17024,THE PARSEES.,"distinctive of his race; though, perhaps, after all, we who live in"
17025,THE PARSEES.,glass houses should not throw stones; for what can be more hideous
17026,THE PARSEES.,than the chimney-pot hat of our boasted civilization? The Parsee
17027,THE PARSEES.,"head-dress, which contests the palm of ugliness with its English"
17028,THE PARSEES.,"rival, is constructed on a strong but light framework, covered with"
17029,THE PARSEES.,"highly-glazed, dark-colored chintz. The priests, who dress like the"
17030,THE PARSEES.,"laity, wear a hat of much the same shape as the former, but white,"
17031,THE PARSEES.,instead of a dark color.
17032,THE PARSEES.,
17033,THE PARSEES.,"On occasions of ceremony, the ordinary tight-fitting narrow garment is"
17034,THE PARSEES.,"exchanged for one with very full skirts, like a petticoat; and a shawl"
17035,THE PARSEES.,"is usually worn round the waist, which is at other times omitted. The"
17036,THE PARSEES.,costume of the women is a combination of that of the Hindoos and
17037,THE PARSEES.,"Mussulmans, consisting of the short body and _sarree_ of the former,"
17038,THE PARSEES.,"with the full trousers of the latter. Both sexes endue themselves, at"
17039,THE PARSEES.,"seven years of age, with the sacred shirt, which is worn over the"
17040,THE PARSEES.,"trousers; the _sadra_, as it is called, is made of a thin, transparent"
17041,THE PARSEES.,"muslin, and is meant to represent the coat-of-mail the men wore when"
17042,THE PARSEES.,"they arrived in India, and with which they believe they can resist the"
17043,THE PARSEES.,"spiritual assaults of Ahriman, the evil principle. The hair of the"
17044,THE PARSEES.,"women is concealed by linen skull-caps, fitting tight to the head."
17045,THE PARSEES.,
17046,THE PARSEES.,It is a singular and interesting sight to watch the Parsees assembled
17047,THE PARSEES.,"on the sea-shore, and, as the sun sinks below the horizon, to mark"
17048,THE PARSEES.,"them prostrating themselves, and offering up their orisons to the"
17049,THE PARSEES.,"great giver of light and heat, which they regard as representing the"
17050,THE PARSEES.,"Deity. Their prayers are uttered, it is said, in an unknown tongue;"
17051,THE PARSEES.,and after the fiery face of the orb of day has disappeared in his
17052,THE PARSEES.,"ocean bed, and the wondrous pillars of light shooting aslant the sky,"
17053,THE PARSEES.,"proclaim that the ""day is done,"" and the night is at hand, they raise"
17054,THE PARSEES.,"themselves from their knees, and turn silently away from the beach,"

17237,FROM THE FRENCH.,

17241,FROM THE FRENCH.,"for a signal to begin, as they stood in groups in the centre of the"

17243,FROM THE FRENCH.,"he was no longer young, he was still strong and active, and seemed to"
17244,FROM THE FRENCH.,"have a powerful constitution. He wore a blue coat, and a decoration at"
17245,FROM THE FRENCH.,"his button-hole, which was given as a token of bravery. He wore a cap"

17247,FROM THE FRENCH.,

17327,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17328,FROM THE FRENCH.,"He then gave a signal for the bell to ring, and the professors and"

17330,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17331,FROM THE FRENCH.,"It was a pretty sight, I can assure you. Such a wonderful combination"

17335,FROM THE FRENCH.,mystery.
17336,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17337,FROM THE FRENCH.,Gymnastic exercises were practised with great care by the ancients.
17338,FROM THE FRENCH.,They formed part of the education of a gentleman. They give that
17339,FROM THE FRENCH.,physical beauty and grace which only spring from a fine muscular
17340,FROM THE FRENCH.,"development. Among the Greeks and Romans, men frequented the gymnasium"
17341,FROM THE FRENCH.,"and the circus. Philosophers, judges, and soldiers took part in these"

17344,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17345,FROM THE FRENCH.,M. Amoros not only gave health and strength to the pupils of his

17348,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17349,FROM THE FRENCH.,Two years had passed away; spring had arrived at the old chateau on
17350,FROM THE FRENCH.,"the Loire, and M. Martel, the father of little Emilie, had returned"
17351,FROM THE FRENCH.,from his voyage to Martinique. He was busy in making many necessary
17352,FROM THE FRENCH.,"repairs in his family mansion, and many workmen came from Paris for"
17353,FROM THE FRENCH.,"that purpose. The night after their arrival, the chateau was"
17354,FROM THE FRENCH.,discovered to be on fire. M. Martel awoke in haste; startled by the
17355,FROM THE FRENCH.,"light of the flames, which suddenly illuminated his room, he ran to"
17356,FROM THE FRENCH.,"see where the fire sprang from, and called aloud for his daughter,"
17357,FROM THE FRENCH.,whom he could not see anywhere. The spectacle that met his view quite
17358,FROM THE FRENCH.,overwhelmed him. The story that was on fire was the place where his
17359,FROM THE FRENCH.,"daughter slept. It could be reached only from a neighboring roof, that"
17360,FROM THE FRENCH.,was almost consumed. A single beam connected one building with the
17361,FROM THE FRENCH.,"other. Notwithstanding his age and the gout, which paralyzed one of"
17362,FROM THE FRENCH.,"his limbs, the poor father wished to climb up and save his daughter,"
17363,FROM THE FRENCH.,"or to die with her. They held him back; he uttered fearful shrieks,"
17364,FROM THE FRENCH.,"when a young man, little more than a boy, was seen on the beam, which"
17365,FROM THE FRENCH.,tottered with his weight. He walked along without fear. A profound
17366,FROM THE FRENCH.,silence succeeded to the cries of terror. The souls of the spectators
17367,FROM THE FRENCH.,seemed to look out of their eyes. M. Martel fell upon his knees.
17368,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17369,FROM THE FRENCH.,"The intrepid youth reached the window, and scaled it. They saw him"
17370,FROM THE FRENCH.,"unroll a long rope, or rope-ladder, and fasten it securely to the iron"
17371,FROM THE FRENCH.,balcony which ornamented the window; then he disappeared.
17372,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17373,FROM THE FRENCH.,Not a sound betrayed the anxiety of the spectators. The unknown man
17374,FROM THE FRENCH.,returned; he held a young person supported upon his back. He mounted
17375,FROM THE FRENCH.,"the iron balcony, and suspended himself with his precious burden upon"
17376,FROM THE FRENCH.,"it, for she was well secured by a strong belt. This horrible suspense"
17377,FROM THE FRENCH.,was more than M. Martel could bear. He covered his face with his
17378,FROM THE FRENCH.,hands. But soon the universal shouts of joy told him that his daughter
17379,FROM THE FRENCH.,was safe.
17380,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17381,FROM THE FRENCH.,"After the first moments of delight, the young girl turned to her"

17385,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17386,FROM THE FRENCH.,"""Mademoiselle Emilie!"""

17389,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17390,FROM THE FRENCH.,"They were no longer two pale, sad children, with haggard little faces,"

17392,FROM THE FRENCH.,"left the gymnasium, and, not living in the same place, they hardly"
17393,FROM THE FRENCH.,"recognized each other. Emilie was a tall and beautiful girl, enjoying"
17394,FROM THE FRENCH.,all the delight of perfect health. Jacques almost had become a man.
17395,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17396,FROM THE FRENCH.,M. Martel had not heard without emotion about his daughter's generous

17399,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17400,FROM THE FRENCH.,"""Am I not well rewarded?"" she exclaimed, extending her hand to the"
17401,FROM THE FRENCH.,"young man. ""You would not have had any daughter without him, papa. The"
17402,FROM THE FRENCH.,"horror of my position, the impossibility of my finding a rope, a"
17403,FROM THE FRENCH.,"ladder, or any way of escape, frightened me so, that I lost my senses,"
17404,FROM THE FRENCH.,"and I should have been burned alive, if it had not been for Jacques."""
17405,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17406,FROM THE FRENCH.,"""Ah, mademoiselle,"" said the slater's son, with emotion, ""it is not"

17411,FROM THE FRENCH.,"Amoros, I am more skilful than any of my fellow-laborers. I can"

17414,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17415,FROM THE FRENCH.,"""Brave boy!"" exclaimed M. Martel, pressing Jacques in his arms, who"

17420,FROM THE FRENCH.,
17421,FROM THE FRENCH.,"M. Martel kept his word. And some days after, when Jacques and his"
17422,FROM THE FRENCH.,"uncle met in the small attic of the poor widow, and were rejoicing"
17423,FROM THE FRENCH.,"over the happy change in their fortunes, the poor mother clasped her"

17577,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"will borrow it for the present;"" and after using it he quietly put it"
17578,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,into his pocket.
17579,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17580,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Some of the boys laughed. One of them, however, murmured, in an"
17581,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"undertone, ""What a great shame!"""
17582,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17583,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Reginald's color rose. He walked straight up to Thompson:
17584,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17585,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Will you please to give me my knife again?"""
17586,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17587,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Thompson looked surprised:
17588,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17589,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""No; I shall please to do nothing of the kind. You offered it, and I"
17590,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"accepted it. An offer's an offer."""
17591,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17592,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I lent it to you to cut the string."""
17593,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17594,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""You did not say so."""
17595,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17596,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I do not think it just of you to take my knife in that way,"" said"
17597,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Reginald, thoroughly aroused; ""and if you do not return it at once, I"
17598,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"shall speak to Dr. Field about it."""
17599,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17600,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Oh!"" said Thompson, coolly; ""you're a sneak, are you?"""
17601,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17602,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,[Illustration: INDUSTRIOUS REGINALD.]
17603,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17604,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The boys, who had been gathering round Reginald, admiring his spirit"
17605,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"in confronting the tall boy, now drew back, and the words ""tell-tale!"""
17606,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""blab!"" ""sneak!"" were distinctly heard. And Reginald found himself"
17607,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"standing alone, deserted by those who had drawn near in sympathy with"
17608,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"him, for Thompson was the tyrant of the school."
17609,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17610,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Presently, when the boys had returned to their places by the fire, and"
17611,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Reginald was apparently forgotten, a merry-looking boy a year older"
17612,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,than himself sat down by him.
17613,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17614,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""No,"" said he; ""you must not say anything to Dr. Field. You must let"
17615,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"your knife go, and learn wisdom for the future."""
17616,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17617,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Reginald looked up.
17618,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17619,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""It's mean and unfair,"" he said."
17620,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17621,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""That may be, but the boys would say it was meaner still to complain."
17622,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"One has to put up with things of this sort at school, and make the"
17623,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"best of them."""
17624,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17625,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""What's your name?"" asked Reginald, suddenly, for there was something"
17626,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"about the boy that he liked, and he thought this might be the one who"
17627,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,was to be his friend.
17628,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17629,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Barton. And yours?"""
17630,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17631,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Reginald Murray."""
17632,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17633,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Murray's enough, without the other."""
17634,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17635,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I should like you to be my friend."""
17636,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17637,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Barton glanced at the large dark eyes that were fixed upon him, and at"
17638,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the delicate and somewhat mournful face, and felt attracted also."
17639,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17640,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I think I shall like you,"" he returned; ""but I must wait and see how"
17641,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,you go on. I think you've the right spirit; but you must take my
17642,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"advice about the knife. Will you?"""
17643,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17644,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,There was a struggle in Reginald's mind. It was very hard to give up
17645,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,the knife that Alice had saved up her pocket-money to buy for him.
17646,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Still, Barton had been at school for some time, and knew better than"
17647,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"he what ought to be done, so he answered, ""I will."""
17648,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17649,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,But Barton was not prepared for his manner of carrying out the
17650,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"decision. To his great surprise, Reginald marched straight up to"
17651,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Thompson. ""I shall not,"" he said, ""speak to Dr. Field about the knife."
17652,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"It's unfair and unjust of you to take it, and I sha'n't be friends"
17653,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,with you as long as you keep it. But Barton says it would be telling
17654,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"tales if I made a complaint."""
17655,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17656,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Some of the younger boys stood quite aghast at Reginald's boldness;
17657,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"one or two even murmured, ""Well done!"""
17658,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17659,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Thompson stared, half in astonishment, half in anger. ""You're too"
17660,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"fast, young sir; you'll have to be put down, I see,"" said he. But he"
17661,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,did not give Reginald his knife again.
17662,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17663,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,School was indeed a new world to Reginald. He made friends and found
17664,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"enemies; he worked hard--indeed, often sat up by candle-light to"
17665,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"prepare examples for the next day. He played well, and on the whole"
17666,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"was tolerably popular. Thompson, however, still kept the knife, using"
17667,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"it upon all occasions, which caused a thrill of indignation to go"
17668,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,through Reginald's delicate frame.
17669,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17670,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""If I can't get it one way, I will another,"" thought he; and he"
17671,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,brooded over the knife until he magnified every word that Thompson
17672,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"said into a series of insults to himself, and Thompson, pleased with"
17673,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the power he possessed over the boy, exercised it on all occasions."
17674,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17675,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"So the spring went by, and the summer came, and the days slipped away,"
17676,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,and the holidays were close at hand.
17677,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17678,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""If I were strong enough, I would fight him for it,"" said Reginald to"
17679,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Barton, one day, when Thompson had been more than usually aggravating."
17680,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17681,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The remark was repeated to Thompson, who was standing by the side of"
17682,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,the river that ran at the foot of the playground.
17683,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17684,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,At that moment Reginald drew near.
17685,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17686,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""So you would like to fight me if you were big enough?"" said he, with"
17687,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,a sneer.
17688,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17689,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I should!"" answered Reginald, warmly."
17690,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17691,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Ah! it's a bad state of feeling. If the knife causes such wicked"
17692,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"thoughts, the best way is to get rid of it. So here it goes, and there"
17693,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"is an end of it!"" And drawing the knife from his pocket, he flung it"
17694,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"into the river. It fell short of where he intended, and Reginald saw"
17695,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"his beloved knife through the clear river, lying within what he"
17696,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,supposed to be an easy reach. Without a moment's thought he jumped in
17697,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"after it, regardless of the cry that rose, ""The water's deeper than it"
17698,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"looks!"""
17699,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17700,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"His hand had, as if by instinct, grasped the knife, but as he tried to"
17701,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"struggle back through the swiftly-running water he got confused, for,"
17702,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"as the boys had called out to him, it was a great deal deeper than it"
17703,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"looked, and just there the ground shelved suddenly, and Reginald,"
17704,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"taking a false step, lost his footing."
17705,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17706,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"There was a general outcry, which brought Dr. Field and a visitor who"
17707,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,had just arrived to the spot:
17708,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17709,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""Murray's in the river!"""
17710,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17711,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,And they pointed to the spot where the poor boy had sunk.
17712,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17713,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"With such a cry as the boys long remembered, the visitor had plunged"
17714,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"into the water, and had caught the boy, who had risen for the last"
17715,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"time, by the arm."
17716,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17717,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"And the next thing that the boys knew was that a white, dripping form"
17718,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,was carried through the playground into the house.
17719,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17720,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Then a whisper went round, ""It was his father."""
17721,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17722,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"Then a whispered question, ""Is he dead?"""
17723,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17724,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,And Thompson shuddered as he heard it.
17725,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17726,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,But Reginald did not die; he opened his eyes to find his father
17727,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"clasping his hand. At first he could remember nothing, then he looked"
17728,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"round anxiously: ""Is the knife safe? I went to pick up my knife."""
17729,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17730,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Then he closed his eyes and remained for a long time silent; and when
17731,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"he spoke again, it was in the wild ravings of delirium."
17732,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17733,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The shock had been too much for the delicate boy. Fever came on, and"
17734,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,it was weeks before he could be moved home. And then he was ordered to
17735,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"the South, and Italy was the chosen place in which Mr. and Mrs. Murray"
17736,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,and their two children should sojourn until Reginald should have
17737,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,completely recovered his health.
17738,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17739,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,And this time Rover was to go with his young master.
17740,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17741,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"The day before Reginald left home a carriage drove up to the door, and"
17742,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,Thompson stepped out of it.
17743,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17744,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"He and Reginald were alone for a quarter of an hour, and they parted"
17745,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,friends.
17746,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17747,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"""I have my knife now, Thompson,"" said Reginald, ""and so the quarrel is"
17748,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,"over."""
17749,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,
17750,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,And Thompson returned to Dr. Field's a better and a wiser boy. He
17751,REGINALD'S FIRST SCHOOL-DAYS.,never bullied any one again.

17901,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,little Gianetta; but it wearies me. It is the old tale; he likes not
17902,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"my music--thinks it an excuse for idleness. Listen, little one. I make"
17903,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,my plans now. I cannot bear this life. I must do as he wishes--learn a
17904,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"trade or somewhat, and give up my violin."""
17905,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17906,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""That you never shall do,"" said Gianetta, earnestly. ""You think me"
17907,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"naughty, Nicolo; but I am not. I only see it plainer than you or your"
17908,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"father. God has given you this talent,--this great one,--and you shall"
17909,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"not hide it, you shall not bury it."" The little girl's face was so"
17910,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"eager, that Nicolo smiled at her."
17911,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17912,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"But she went on, more excitedly:--"
17913,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17914,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Get up this moment, Nicolo, and come in with me. We will play"
17915,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,somewhat together. Your father never scolds you when I am by. And you
17916,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"shall not give up your music."""
17917,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17918,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"The boy, half in earnest, and half amused, let the child drag him into"
17919,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"a little house near, put his violin into his arms, and then seat"
17920,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"herself at the piano, while in the distance sat Nicolo's father,"
17921,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,gloomily watching the pair.
17922,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17923,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Begin,"" said Gianetta, ""and tell me when I play wrongly."""
17924,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17925,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"But for such a mere child, Gianetta played with marvellous"
17926,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"correctness. As for Nicolo, his countenance cleared with every sound"
17927,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,that he drew from his beloved violin; he forgot his gloomy father; he
17928,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"thought no longer of his dull, sad home. He was wrapped in that"
17929,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,wonderful content which the possession of some great talent gives.
17930,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17931,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"With the last chord the brightness faded, however, out of his face."
17932,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17933,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Take me home now,"" said the little girl."
17934,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17935,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,Home was only across the street; but Gianetta wanted another word in
17936,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,private with her friend.
17937,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17938,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Nicolo,"" she said, gravely, ""never speak more of giving up the music;"
17939,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"it is not to be. I am sorry for you, my poor boy; I know it is a hard"
17940,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"life, but--"""
17941,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17942,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""But I will make a name for myself at last,"" said Nicolo, catching her"
17943,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"enthusiasm; ""and then, perhaps, my father will have faith in me. Till"
17944,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"then I will be brave, little one; so good night."""
17945,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17946,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"It _was_ a hard life for Nicolo--his mother dead, his father with no"
17947,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,care for his son's one great passion--music. Many a time the boy's
17948,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"spirit failed, and he even grew to doubt his own powers under the cold"
17949,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,glance and cruel taunts which daily met him.
17950,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17951,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"He was sitting one day, feeling even sadder than usual,--discontented"
17952,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"even with the sounds he drew from his instrument,--when Gianetta's"
17953,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,mother stood in the doorway.
17954,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17955,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""The child is ill,"" she said, hurriedly--""very ill, and calls ever for"
17956,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"you. Come."""
17957,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17958,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"So Nicolo went, and, though tossed with fever, his little friend"
17959,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"smiled on him. There was, however, a longing look in her eyes; but her"
17960,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,parched lips could not form a word.
17961,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17962,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Is it the violin?"" asked Nicolo, softly."
17963,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17964,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"She smiled again, and Nicolo fetched his treasure."
17965,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17966,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""A sleeping song?"" he questioned."
17967,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17968,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,The little face grew calm and soft at his question. Sweetly the music
17969,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"floated through the room, stilling the little sufferer, and comforting"
17970,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"the watchers. When he had finished, Gianetta stretched out her arms."
17971,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17972,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"""Thank you, dear Nicolo,"" she said; ""that was pleasant. Now I shall"
17973,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,sleep; but _you_ must never sleep; you have much else to do; you must
17974,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"go out into the world, and be famous--go away far, far from here. Do"
17975,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"you mind my words? Will you remember them?"""
17976,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17977,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"And she lay back exhausted on her pillow, never more to ask for music"
17978,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,in this world. Gianetta was listening even then to the angels' song.
17979,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17980,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,That night Nicolo sat beside the dead body of his little friend.
17981,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"Lights burned, flowers were scattered round her, and prayers were said"
17982,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,without ceasing in all those long hours. It was the custom of the
17983,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"country; it did not disturb the dead, and it comforted the living."
17984,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17985,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"And when morning dawned, the friendless boy went back to his little"
17986,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"room across the road, and there he poured out his heart in a farewell"
17987,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,strain to his dear companion who had thus suddenly been snatched from
17988,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,him.
17989,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17990,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,There was no more now to be done but to fulfil her last command--to
17991,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"go out into the world, and to make himself famous."
17992,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17993,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,Did he do so?
17994,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17995,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"Ask those who love music, and hold dear all great names in its roll of"
17996,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"fame, if they ever heard of Nicolo Paganini; for it is of his boyhood"
17997,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,that I write.
17998,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,
17999,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"How far he owed his success in life to a little girl, each reader may"
18000,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,judge for himself. She certainly inspired him with courage when he was
18001,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,"very down-hearted; and through all his brilliant career, I think he at"
18002,NICOLO'S LITTLE FRIEND.,least must always have remembered her with gratitude.

18044,THE TRUANT.,
18045,THE TRUANT.,
18046,THE TRUANT.,"""What's the matter with Neddy Oram?"" I said as a noise outside drew me"
18047,THE TRUANT.,"to the window, and I saw old Mrs. Oram dragging her grandson along the"
18048,THE TRUANT.,street. She looked angry and determined.
18049,THE TRUANT.,
18050,THE TRUANT.,"""He's played truant, I guess,"" answered my little girl as she came to"
18051,THE TRUANT.,"my side. ""He played truant last week, and Mr. Jonas made him stand on"
18052,THE TRUANT.,one foot ever so long a time. And when he got tired and put the other
18053,THE TRUANT.,"one down, he switched him on the leg. Oh dear! I don't want to go this"
18054,THE TRUANT.,"morning. I wish Neddy wouldn't play truant, nor be bad in school! He's"
18055,THE TRUANT.,"such a nice boy, and I can't bear to see him whipped. Mr. Jonas will"
18056,THE TRUANT.,"cut him dreadfully, I know he will, for he said he'd take the skin off"
18057,THE TRUANT.,"of him if ever he played truant again."""
18058,THE TRUANT.,
18059,THE TRUANT.,"Neddy was a nice boy, as my little girl said. He was bright and"
18060,THE TRUANT.,"active, kind-hearted and generous. I never saw him do a mean or"
18061,THE TRUANT.,"selfish thing. But he had a free, rather reckless spirit and a will"
18062,THE TRUANT.,"that was stubbornness itself when aroused. Kindness softened, but"
18063,THE TRUANT.,"anger hardened, him."
18064,THE TRUANT.,
18065,THE TRUANT.,"Neddy's father and mother were both dead, and the boy lived with his"
18066,THE TRUANT.,"grandmother, who was rather a hard woman, and believed more in the"
18067,THE TRUANT.,power of force than in the power of kindness.
18068,THE TRUANT.,
18069,THE TRUANT.,As soon as I understood the case I put on my bonnet hastily and ran
18070,THE TRUANT.,"after Mrs. Oram, hoping to come up with her before she reached the"
18071,THE TRUANT.,"school-room. I was a few moments too late for this, but in time to"
18072,THE TRUANT.,"have a word with Mr. Jonas, who stood at the door holding the"
18073,THE TRUANT.,struggling boy firmly by the arm.
18074,THE TRUANT.,
18075,THE TRUANT.,"""I want you to promise me one thing,"" I said, laying my hand on the"
18076,THE TRUANT.,"schoolmaster's. I spoke in as quiet a voice as I could assume, but"
18077,THE TRUANT.,very seriously. My words and manner threw Mr. Jonas off of his guard.
18078,THE TRUANT.,"His hold on the boy relaxed, and in the next instant Neddy was beyond"
18079,THE TRUANT.,his reach and running off as fast as his feet could carry him.
18080,THE TRUANT.,
18081,THE TRUANT.,"""After him!"" cried the schoolmaster, greatly excited. ""After him, John"
18082,THE TRUANT.,"Wilkins!"""
18083,THE TRUANT.,
18084,THE TRUANT.,"A large, coarse-looking boy started forward, and was about passing"
18085,THE TRUANT.,"through the door, when I put my hand on him, and pressing him back"
18086,THE TRUANT.,"said,"
18087,THE TRUANT.,
18088,THE TRUANT.,"""Wait a moment, John. Maybe, after I've said a word to Mr. Jonas,"
18089,THE TRUANT.,"he'll not want you to go. Tell him to wait, Mr. Jonas; do, now,"
18090,THE TRUANT.,"because I want you."""
18091,THE TRUANT.,
18092,THE TRUANT.,"I softened my voice to a persuasive tone, and so made my interference"
18093,THE TRUANT.,effectual. The schoolmaster told John Wilkins to go back to his seat.
18094,THE TRUANT.,
18095,THE TRUANT.,Mrs. Oram had started after her troublesome grandson on the instant of
18096,THE TRUANT.,"his escape, and so I was left alone with the excited teacher."
18097,THE TRUANT.,
18098,THE TRUANT.,"""Now, don't be angry with me,"" said I, ""nor tell me to go away and"
18099,THE TRUANT.,mind my own business. Two heads are sometimes better than one; and
18100,THE TRUANT.,"it's my opinion that if you and I put our heads together, we can save"
18101,THE TRUANT.,this poor boy from being ruined. There is a great deal of good in
18102,THE TRUANT.,"him, but as things go now I'm afraid it will be lost. With natures"
18103,THE TRUANT.,"like his, 'love has readier will than fear.' His grandmother doesn't"
18104,THE TRUANT.,"know how to manage him. Let us try to show her a better way."""
18105,THE TRUANT.,
18106,THE TRUANT.,[Illustration: THE TRUANT.]
18107,THE TRUANT.,
18108,THE TRUANT.,By the time I had said this the thoughts of Mr. Jonas had become
18109,THE TRUANT.,clearer and his anger against Neddy much abated. I saw this in his
18110,THE TRUANT.,face.
18111,THE TRUANT.,
18112,THE TRUANT.,"""Let the boy go now,"" I added. ""After school come and see me, and"
18113,THE TRUANT.,"we'll have a long talk over the matter. But promise me one thing."""
18114,THE TRUANT.,
18115,THE TRUANT.,"""What is that?"" he asked."
18116,THE TRUANT.,
18117,THE TRUANT.,"""If old Mrs. Oram brings Neddy back to-day, don't punish him."""
18118,THE TRUANT.,
18119,THE TRUANT.,"""Very well. It shall be as you say,"" answered the schoolmaster."
18120,THE TRUANT.,
18121,THE TRUANT.,"That evening Mr. Jonas called to see me. He was a better man, on the"
18122,THE TRUANT.,"whole, than he was a schoolmaster. Out of school he was kind and"
18123,THE TRUANT.,"genial, but as a teacher he was not always as wise and as patient as"
18124,THE TRUANT.,"he should be. Like Neddy's grandmother, he believed more in the power"
18125,THE TRUANT.,of force than he did in the power of kindness. His rod was always in
18126,THE TRUANT.,"sight, and too often in his hand. He ruled by fear, and not by love."
18127,THE TRUANT.,
18128,THE TRUANT.,"""Did Neddy come back to school?"" I asked."
18129,THE TRUANT.,
18130,THE TRUANT.,Mr. Jonas shook his head gravely.
18131,THE TRUANT.,
18132,THE TRUANT.,"""Oh, mother,"" cried my little girl, rushing into the room just at this"
18133,THE TRUANT.,"moment, ""Neddy Oram's lost or run away!"""
18134,THE TRUANT.,
18135,THE TRUANT.,"She stopped on seeing Mr. Jonas; her face, that had been a little"
18136,THE TRUANT.,"pale, flushed deeply, and her eyes had an angry flash. ""And it's all"
18137,THE TRUANT.,"your fault!"" she added, with a sudden brave indignation in her tiny"
18138,THE TRUANT.,voice as she turned on the schoolmaster and looked at him steadily.
18139,THE TRUANT.,
18140,THE TRUANT.,"""My fault!"" said the schoolmaster, in a startled voice."
18141,THE TRUANT.,
18142,THE TRUANT.,"""Yes, sir. It's all your fault. If you hadn't made him stand on one"
18143,THE TRUANT.,"leg until he was almost tired to death, and switched him when he put"
18144,THE TRUANT.,"the other down, and if you hadn't said you'd cut the skin off of him,"
18145,THE TRUANT.,"he wouldn't have run away."""
18146,THE TRUANT.,
18147,THE TRUANT.,"And here little Carrie burst out crying, and buried her face, sobbing,"
18148,THE TRUANT.,in my lap.
18149,THE TRUANT.,
18150,THE TRUANT.,"""Brave talk for my timid little girl, Mr. Jonas,"" I said, in an"
18151,THE TRUANT.,"undertone, ""but all true, I'm afraid."""
18152,THE TRUANT.,
18153,THE TRUANT.,"""What is true?"" he asked, looking bewildered."
18154,THE TRUANT.,
18155,THE TRUANT.,"""All that Carrie has said. This way you have of flogging children does"
18156,THE TRUANT.,more harm than good. A man of your clear mind and kindly nature might
18157,THE TRUANT.,"surely find some better way to govern your scholars."""
18158,THE TRUANT.,
18159,THE TRUANT.,Mr. Jonas did not answer. There was a look of pained surprise on his
18160,THE TRUANT.,face.
18161,THE TRUANT.,
18162,THE TRUANT.,"""Run away, lost!"" he exclaimed, after a few moments, rising to his"
18163,THE TRUANT.,"feet. His manner had become suddenly agitated. ""Poor boy! I must see"
18164,THE TRUANT.,"about this;"" and he went out hastily."
18165,THE TRUANT.,
18166,THE TRUANT.,"When Neddy Oram, who was only ten years old, escaped from the"
18167,THE TRUANT.,"schoolmaster, he went directly home and hid himself in the garret,"
18168,THE TRUANT.,behind some boxes and old furniture. He ran so much faster than his
18169,THE TRUANT.,grandmother that she lost sight of him and did not see him go into the
18170,THE TRUANT.,house. So no search was made for him in the garret. Like some poor
18171,THE TRUANT.,"hunted animal that had gained a place of safety, he crouched panting"
18172,THE TRUANT.,"in his hiding-place, enjoying for a time a sweet sense of security."
18173,THE TRUANT.,But Neddy could not long forget how small and weak and dependent he
18174,THE TRUANT.,"was. It was all very well to hide away from his grandmother, but how"
18175,THE TRUANT.,was he to get anything to eat?
18176,THE TRUANT.,
18177,THE TRUANT.,"""Run away!"" said a voice that spoke inside of him, but so loud and"
18178,THE TRUANT.,"clear that he almost started. ""Run away!"" repeated the voice."
18179,THE TRUANT.,"""Grandmother Oram will find you out up here and take you back to"
18180,THE TRUANT.,"school, and Mr. Jonas will switch you half to death."""
18181,THE TRUANT.,
18182,THE TRUANT.,"I wonder who it was that said this, or how a voice could speak inside"
18183,THE TRUANT.,"of Neddy Oram? It was a bad spirit, I think, that wished to do him"
18184,THE TRUANT.,harm. We may often hear these bad spirits speaking in our thoughts and
18185,THE TRUANT.,telling us to do naughty things. Good spirits speak in our thoughts as
18186,THE TRUANT.,"well as bad ones, and they tell us to do what is right, to be kind and"
18187,THE TRUANT.,generous and loving and true.
18188,THE TRUANT.,
18189,THE TRUANT.,"I am sorry to say that Neddy, who was not only angry with his"
18190,THE TRUANT.,"grandmother and the schoolmaster, but on account of his wrong-doings"
18191,THE TRUANT.,"and disobedience afraid of them, listened to this voice, and as he"
18192,THE TRUANT.,listened the bad spirit made the voice seem so like his own thoughts
18193,THE TRUANT.,that he knew not but that all came from himself.
18194,THE TRUANT.,
18195,THE TRUANT.,"So under this wrong influence he planned an escape from the house,"
18196,THE TRUANT.,which was to be made as soon as his grandmother went out. For an hour
18197,THE TRUANT.,or two he heard her moving around. At last all was still. Then he
18198,THE TRUANT.,stole from his hiding-place and listened at the head of the stairs.
18199,THE TRUANT.,Not the slightest sound broke the deep silence. Grandmother had gone
18200,THE TRUANT.,"away. Then he took a loaf of bread, a large slice of cake and some"
18201,THE TRUANT.,"apples, which he tied up in a handkerchief; and stealing out of the"
18202,THE TRUANT.,"back door, he ran through the garden and out of a gate that opened"
18203,THE TRUANT.,"into a lane. At the end of this lane was a piece of woods, and beyond"
18204,THE TRUANT.,"this wood a deep hollow, along which it was easy to go without danger"
18205,THE TRUANT.,of being seen by any one.
18206,THE TRUANT.,
18207,THE TRUANT.,"How strangely the little boy's heart beat as he hurried along, going"
18208,THE TRUANT.,he knew not whither! It was not long before he reached the hollow
18209,THE TRUANT.,"beyond the woods. After crossing this hollow, he entered another wood"
18210,THE TRUANT.,by a narrow path made by the cattle. The trees in this wood were very
18211,THE TRUANT.,"tall and close together, and the underbrush grew so thick that he"
18212,THE TRUANT.,could see before him only for a short distance.
18213,THE TRUANT.,
18214,THE TRUANT.,The silence and darkness of this heavy forest caused a lonely feeling
18215,THE TRUANT.,to come over Neddy. All at once the thought of bears and wolves came
18216,THE TRUANT.,"into his mind, and with the thought fear crept into his heart. A"
18217,THE TRUANT.,"weakness fell upon him, and he stood still with drops of cold sweat"
18218,THE TRUANT.,"on his forehead. Then he turned and ran back, but in doing so missed"
18219,THE TRUANT.,"the way and took a path that, instead of taking him out of the forest,"
18220,THE TRUANT.,"led him farther into it. He ran and ran, panting for breath, until he"
18221,THE TRUANT.,was so tired that he had to sit down to rest.
18222,THE TRUANT.,
18223,THE TRUANT.,"""What if I am lost?"" he said to himself, a cold chill running over him"
18224,THE TRUANT.,at the thought. Lost! How wildly the poor little boy's heart began to
18225,THE TRUANT.,"beat! As he sat there, feeling too weak from weariness and fear to"
18226,THE TRUANT.,"arise, he heard not far off the sound of feet cracking the dry sticks"
18227,THE TRUANT.,and rustling the leaves that lay upon the ground. He held his breath
18228,THE TRUANT.,"in terror, for he was sure it was a bear or wolf. Nearer and nearer"
18229,THE TRUANT.,"the animal came, passing only a few rods from where he sat motionless."
18230,THE TRUANT.,
18231,THE TRUANT.,"""Oh, oh!"" exclaimed Neddy, in tones of relief, starting to his feet as"
18232,THE TRUANT.,he saw a young heifer which was astray in the woods.
18233,THE TRUANT.,
18234,THE TRUANT.,"At sight of the boy the heifer, scared by his sudden appearance,"
18235,THE TRUANT.,"started off at a run and was soon out of sight, leaving Neddy again"
18236,THE TRUANT.,"alone. He tried to follow her, but was not able to get on her track."
18237,THE TRUANT.,Oh how he did wish himself at home! How sorry he was that he had
18238,THE TRUANT.,played truant on the day before!
18239,THE TRUANT.,
18240,THE TRUANT.,"In trying to follow the heifer, Neddy left the narrow path along which"
18241,THE TRUANT.,"he had been going, and now he was among the thick undergrowth of the"
18242,THE TRUANT.,"forest, his hands and face scratched with briars. The trees stood so"
18243,THE TRUANT.,close together that no sunshine came down through their thick
18244,THE TRUANT.,branches. All was dim and shadowy.
18245,THE TRUANT.,
18246,THE TRUANT.,Poor Neddy! A great fear and loneliness fell on him again; and sitting
18247,THE TRUANT.,"down on the limb of a fallen tree, he began to cry bitterly. But"
18248,THE TRUANT.,crying was of no use. It wouldn't get him out of the woods and safely
18249,THE TRUANT.,"home again. So he dried his tears and started on again, hoping to find"
18250,THE TRUANT.,the path he had left. But he tried in vain. All at once he noticed
18251,THE TRUANT.,that the light was fading rapidly and the air growing cold. The sun
18252,THE TRUANT.,"had gone down, and night was falling. Neddy's heart began to beat"
18253,THE TRUANT.,wildly; he could feel the throbs all over him; there was a great
18254,THE TRUANT.,pressure as if a hand were laid on his breast; he could scarcely
18255,THE TRUANT.,"breathe, so strong was the feeling of suffocation that oppressed him."
18256,THE TRUANT.,"He tried to run, but his foot caught in a vine, and he fell upon the"
18257,THE TRUANT.,"ground, where he lay for a long time before he had strength enough to"
18258,THE TRUANT.,arise.
18259,THE TRUANT.,
18260,THE TRUANT.,In his weakness and exhaustion the poor boy found strength and
18261,THE TRUANT.,"courage. How! Think, my little reader. What would you have done if"
18262,THE TRUANT.,lost in the woods as Neddy was lost? Where would you have looked for
18263,THE TRUANT.,"help? You would have done, I am very sure, just as he did. And what"
18264,THE TRUANT.,"did he do? Why, he put his little hands together, and lifting his"
18265,THE TRUANT.,"tearful eyes upward prayed that God would take care of him, and not"
18266,THE TRUANT.,let any wild beasts eat him up.
18267,THE TRUANT.,
18268,THE TRUANT.,As soon as he had done this the dreadful fear from which he was
18269,THE TRUANT.,suffering went out of his heart. Just a little way beyond the spot
18270,THE TRUANT.,"where Neddy had fallen was a small clear place in the forest, where"
18271,THE TRUANT.,grew a bed of soft green moss. A few rays of light came down through
18272,THE TRUANT.,"an opening in the trees and showed him this cosy nook. Once in it,"
18273,THE TRUANT.,there seemed to grow all about him a wall of darkness. So he sat down
18274,THE TRUANT.,upon the moss with a strange feeling of peace and security in his
18275,THE TRUANT.,heart.
18276,THE TRUANT.,
18277,THE TRUANT.,"And now, for the first time, Neddy felt hungry. So he opened the"
18278,THE TRUANT.,"bundle of bread and cake which he had brought with him, and ate with a"
18279,THE TRUANT.,keen relish. Then he began to feel tired and heavy. The soft moss on
18280,THE TRUANT.,"which he was resting was just the bed for a poor tired boy like him,"
18281,THE TRUANT.,and before he had time to think of his loneliness and danger he was
18282,THE TRUANT.,fast asleep.
18283,THE TRUANT.,
18284,THE TRUANT.,"But sleep sometimes gives us frightful dreams, and one of these came"
18285,THE TRUANT.,to Neddy. He still thought himself a poor lost boy in the woods trying
18286,THE TRUANT.,"to find his way out. He heard wolves howling, and saw bears and tigers"
18287,THE TRUANT.,and all kinds of wild beasts. At last a wolf with great red jaws came
18288,THE TRUANT.,"after him, and he started to run, but his terror was so great that he"
18289,THE TRUANT.,"could scarcely move his feet. A fearful growl ran through the woods,"
18290,THE TRUANT.,and the dreadful beast came rushing down upon him. At this frightful
18291,THE TRUANT.,"moment he heard his name called; and turning, he saw Mr. Jonas, the"
18292,THE TRUANT.,"schoolmaster, running toward him with an axe in his hand, with which"
18293,THE TRUANT.,he struck the wolf just as he was about seizing him. The wolf fell
18294,THE TRUANT.,"dead, and the schoolmaster, catching Neddy up in his arms, said,"
18295,THE TRUANT.,"tenderly, ""My poor, poor boy!"" and hugged him tightly to his breast."
18296,THE TRUANT.,
18297,THE TRUANT.,"Was all this a dream? No, not all, for Neddy awoke and found himself"
18298,THE TRUANT.,"in the schoolmaster's arms, with two or three men around holding"
18299,THE TRUANT.,lanterns in their hands.
18300,THE TRUANT.,
18301,THE TRUANT.,"""My poor, poor boy!"" said the schoolmaster again, laying his hand"
18302,THE TRUANT.,tenderly on his recovered scholar; and this time Neddy heard the words
18303,THE TRUANT.,in full wakefulness.
18304,THE TRUANT.,
18305,THE TRUANT.,"He did not stir, but lay with his head close against Mr. Jonas, who,"
18306,THE TRUANT.,"guided by the men with lanterns, walked hurriedly through the forest,"
18307,THE TRUANT.,and soon came to the road that led to the village.
18308,THE TRUANT.,
18309,THE TRUANT.,"I was at Grandmother Oram's, waiting anxiously for news of the lost"
18310,THE TRUANT.,"boy, when the schoolmaster came in with Neddy in his arms. I had been"
18311,THE TRUANT.,talking long and seriously with the frightened old lady about her way
18312,THE TRUANT.,"of treating Neddy, and she had promised me not to say a hard or angry"
18313,THE TRUANT.,"word to him when he came home, if that ever should be. She was very"
18314,THE TRUANT.,"much softened, and her real love for Neddy was having its full course."
18315,THE TRUANT.,
18316,THE TRUANT.,It was after ten o'clock when we heard the sound of coming feet. The
18317,THE TRUANT.,poor old lady started up and stood pale and breathless. The door
18318,THE TRUANT.,"opened and Mr. Jonas came in, carrying Neddy in his arms. His face was"
18319,THE TRUANT.,softer in expression than I had ever seen it. He did not say a word
18320,THE TRUANT.,"until he came close up to Mrs. Oram, when, holding out the boy, he"
18321,THE TRUANT.,"said, in a low voice that was broken and tender, ""Be kind to the poor"
18322,THE TRUANT.,"child, Mrs. Oram. I will see you about him in the morning,"" then"
18323,THE TRUANT.,"merely adding, as he turned to leave, ""We found him asleep in the"
18324,THE TRUANT.,"woods,"" went out hastily."
18325,THE TRUANT.,
18326,THE TRUANT.,There was a new order of things in the village school after that. The
18327,THE TRUANT.,"rod fell from Mr. Jonas' hand, never to be lifted again, and he soon"
18328,THE TRUANT.,learned that in kindness was greater power than in fear. Neddy was in
18329,THE TRUANT.,"his place on the next day, and from that time onward was one of the"
18330,THE TRUANT.,most obedient and faithful scholars in school. Mr. Jonas' manner
18331,THE TRUANT.,"toward him was kind and gentle, and Neddy felt drawn toward him by a"
18332,THE TRUANT.,strange attraction that gave the schoolmaster the power over him of a
18333,THE TRUANT.,wise and loving father. No thought of disobedience crossed the boy's
18334,THE TRUANT.,mind. It was his delight to obey.
18335,THE TRUANT.,
18336,THE TRUANT.,"All this happened many years ago, and now the boy Neddy has grown to"
18337,THE TRUANT.,"be a strong, wise, good man, an honor to the position he holds, and"
18338,THE TRUANT.,one of the best of citizens. He had the opportunity of doing Mr. Jonas
18339,THE TRUANT.,many kind acts; and when at last the old man grew too feeble to earn
18340,THE TRUANT.,"his living, Mr. Oram made his last days comfortable by placing him"
18341,THE TRUANT.,above the reach of want.
