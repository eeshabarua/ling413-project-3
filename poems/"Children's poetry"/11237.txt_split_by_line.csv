59,THE DYING BOY.,"A little boy, by the name of Bertie, was taken very ill, and for"
60,THE DYING BOY.,sometime continued to grow weaker until he died. A few hours before
61,THE DYING BOY.,"his death he revived up, and his first request was to be bathed in the"
62,THE DYING BOY.,"river; but his mother persuaded him to be sponged only, as the river"
63,THE DYING BOY.,water would be too cold for his weak frame. After his mother had
64,THE DYING BOY.,"sponged him with water, he desired to be dressed; when his mother"
65,THE DYING BOY.,"dressed him in his green coat and white collar, and seated him at the"
66,THE DYING BOY.,table with all his books and worldly treasures around him. As he sat
67,THE DYING BOY.,"there, one would have thought that he was about to commence a course"
68,THE DYING BOY.,"of study; and yet in the marble paleness of his features, and in the"
69,THE DYING BOY.,"listless and languid eye, there was evidence that life in the boy was"
70,THE DYING BOY.,"like an expiring taper, flickering in the socket. He soon asked to go"
71,THE DYING BOY.,"out in his little carriage. His grandfather, whom he very much loved,"
72,THE DYING BOY.,"placed him in it, and carefully avoiding every stone, drew him to a"
73,THE DYING BOY.,spot commanding the entire landscape. The tide was up and the sun was
74,THE DYING BOY.,"shining on the deep blue waters, and bathing the distant mountains and"
75,THE DYING BOY.,the green meadows in liquid gold. The gardens and orchards around were
76,THE DYING BOY.,gay in the rich crimson blossoms of the apple tree; the air was filled
77,THE DYING BOY.,"with the sweet fragrance of flowers, and the birds were singing"
78,THE DYING BOY.,"beautifully, when little Bertie looked for the last time on the scenes"
79,THE DYING BOY.,"of earth. He could not remain long, and was soon taken back to the"
80,THE DYING BOY.,"little parlor, where he sat on the sofa, resting his elbows on the"
81,THE DYING BOY.,table. It was not long before the little boy died. But he was very
82,THE DYING BOY.,"happy. Among his last words were these, addressed to his little sister"
83,THE DYING BOY.,"three years old: ""Well, Emmie, very ill--me going to Jesus."""
84,THE DYING BOY.,

94,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,A bright eyed boy was sleeping upon a bank of blossoming clover. The
95,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"cool breeze lifted the curls from his brow, and fanned with downy"
96,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"wings his quiet slumbers, while he lay under the refreshing shade of a"
97,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,large maple tree. The birds sang to him during his happy hours of
98,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"sleep. By and by he awoke, and a beautiful gold robin sat on the"
99,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"spray, and sung a song of joy. The boy reached out his hands to secure"
100,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"the prize, but the robin spread his golden wings and soared away. He"
101,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"looked after it with a longing gaze, and when it disappeared from his"
102,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"sight, he wept aloud. At this moment, a form of light approached, and"
103,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,took the hands of the child and pointed upwards; and he saw the bird
104,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"soaring in freedom, and the sun shining upon its burnished plumes."
105,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"Then the shining one said: ""Do you love that beautiful bird?"" In the"
106,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"midst of his tears the child replied, ""Oh, yes."" ""Then,"" said the"
107,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"angel, ""shall it not wing its flight from flower to flower and be"
108,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"happy, rather than to dwell in a prison with thee?"" Then the streams"
109,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"and flowering vales of Elysium, that breathe the pure air of freedom,"
110,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"spake: ""Wouldst thou bring her back to thee, and make her a prisoner?"
111,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"Dry up thy tears, and let thy song be, 'Stay not here, but speed thy"
112,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"flight, O bright one, and snuff the mellow air of freedom.' God made"
113,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"the birds to be happy in their short existence, and ought we to"
114,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"deprive them of their own elements of happiness, and take from them"
115,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"the freedom which they enjoy?"""

124,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"A little girl, by the name of Sarah Dean, was taught the precepts of"
125,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,the Bible by her mother. One day she came to her mother very much
126,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"delighted, to show her some plums that a friend had given her. The"
127,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"mother said to her: ""Your friend was very kind, and has given you a"
128,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"great many."" ""Yes,"" replied Sarah. ""she was, and she gave me more than"
129,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"these, but I have given some away."" The mother asked to whom she had"
130,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"given them; when the child replied: ""I gave them to a girl that pushes"
131,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"me off the path, and makes faces at me."" Upon being asked why she gave"
132,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"them to her, she answered: ""Because I thought that should make her"
133,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"know that I wished to be kind to her, and perhaps she will not be"
134,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"unkind and rude to me again."" This was true. The rude girl was"
135,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"afterwards very good to Sarah, and felt very sorry that she had"
136,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"treated her unkindly. How truly did the little girl obey the command,"
137,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"""_overcome evil with good_."""

146,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"It was on a Sabbath eve, when at a friend's house, we were all sitting"
147,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"in the piazza, conversing about the efforts which were being made for"
148,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"the poor heathen, and the number of Testaments which were being sent"
149,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,to them.
150,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
151,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Father,"" said little Harriet, ""do the little heathen children wish to"
152,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"learn to read the New Testament?"""
153,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
154,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""O yes, my child, many of them do,"" said the father."
155,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
156,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""But have they all got Testaments if they did know how to read?"" ""No,"
157,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"my love; few of them have ever heard about the Testament, about God,"
158,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"or about Jesus Christ."" ""Will half a dollar buy one?"" said Harriet. ""O"
159,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"yes, my child."""
160,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
161,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Then,"" said Harriet, ""may I sell anything I have, if I can get the"
162,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"money?"" Her father told her she might."
163,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
164,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"Now, every child has some favorite toy. Harriet's was a beautiful tame"
165,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"_gray_ squirrel. It would eat from her hands, attend her in her"

167,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
168,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"She called its name Jenny. It was taken sick, and the little girl"
169,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"nursed it with care, but it at last died in her lap."
170,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
171,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"Little Harriet wept sadly about it, and her father tried to console"
172,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"her, and told her not to feel so."
173,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
174,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Ah,"" said she, ""you know, father, you told me that I might sell"
175,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"anything I had to buy a Testament for the heathen children, and I was"
176,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"going to sell my pretty squirrel to Mr. Smith, who said he would give"
177,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"me half a dollar for it; but now my Jenny is dead."" The Father then"
178,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"put a silver dollar into Harriet's hand, and she dried her tears,"
179,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,rejoicing that Jenny's death would be the means of his little daughter

189,THE REWARD.,A teacher in a Sabbath School promised to supply all the children in

191,THE REWARD.,
192,THE REWARD.,One of the little girls went home from the school after the books were
193,THE REWARD.,"given out, and said:"
194,THE REWARD.,
195,THE REWARD.,"""Mamma, if I had told a lie to-day, I would have got a catechism."""
196,THE REWARD.,
197,THE REWARD.,"""I think that very strange, Eliza; for the Sabbath School is no place"

205,THE REWARD.,told me on the way how their mother had bought each of them a new
206,THE REWARD.,"catechism on last market day, and they said, if I once saw how pretty"
207,THE REWARD.,"their books were, I would not look at my old one any more. Our teacher"
208,THE REWARD.,"asked us all, when we went in, if we had any catechisms, and those who"
209,THE REWARD.,"said they had not, received one from the teacher as a present. Jane,"
210,THE REWARD.,"after all she told me, by the way, denied that she had any, and Lizzy"
211,THE REWARD.,"did the same. But when he asked me, I told him I had one at home; but"

235,ANECDOTES.,"""Pray, gentlemen,"" said I, ""what is the matter?"" One of them informed"
236,ANECDOTES.,"me that a genteelly dressed man had hastily come up to him, and"
237,ANECDOTES.,"tapping him on the shoulder, had said:"

391,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
392,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"Early in the morning, before it was light, and while the twilight"
393,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"gleamed through the curtainless windows, Lettice was up dressing"
394,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,herself by the aid of the light which gleamed from the street lamp
395,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"into the window. She combed her hair with modest neatness, then opened"
396,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"the draw with much precaution, lest she should disturb poor Myra, who"
397,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,still slumbered on the hard mattrass--drew out a shawl and began to
398,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,fold it as if to put it on.
399,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
400,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"""Alas!"" said Lettice, ""this will not do--it is thread-bare, time-worn,"
401,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"and has given way in two places."" She turned it, and unfolded it, but"
402,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,it would not do. It was so shabby that she was actually ashamed to be
403,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,seen with it in the street. She put it aside and took the liberty of
404,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"borrowing Myra's, who was now asleep. She knew Myra would be awful"
405,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"cold when she got up, and would need it. But she must go with the work"
406,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"that morning. She thought first of preparing the fire, so that Myra,"
407,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"when she arose, would only have to light the match; but as she went to"
408,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"the box for coal, she saw, with terror, how low the little store of"
409,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"fuel was, and she said to herself, ""we must have a bushel of coal"
410,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"to-day--better to do without meat than fire such weather as this."" But"
411,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,she was cheered with the reflection that she should receive a little
412,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,more for her work that day than what she had from other places. It had
413,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,been ordered by a benevolent lady who had been to some trouble in
414,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,getting the poor woman supplied with needle work so that they should
415,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"receive the full price. She had worked for private customers before,"
416,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"and always received more pay from them than from the shops in London,"
417,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,where they would beat down the poor to the last penny.
418,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
419,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,Poor Lettice went to the old band-box and took out a shabby old
420,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"bonnet--she looked at it, and sighed, when she thought of the"
421,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"appearance she must make; for she was going to Mrs. Danvers, and her"
422,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,work was some very nice linen for a young lady about to be married.
423,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
424,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,Just at this moment she thought of the contrast between all the fine
425,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"things that young lady was to have, and her own destitution. But her"
426,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,disposition was such as not to cause her to think hard of others who
427,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,had plenty while she was poor. She was contented to receive her pay
428,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"from the wealthy, for her daily needle work. She felt that what they"
429,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"had was not taken from her, and if she could gain in her little way by"
430,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"receiving her just earnings from the general prosperity of others, she"
431,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,would not complain. And as the thought of the increased pay came into
432,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"her mind, which she was to receive that day, she brightened up, shook"
433,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"the bonnet, pulled out the ribbons, and made it look as tidy as"
434,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"possible, thinking to herself that after buying some fuel she might"
435,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"possibly buy a bit of ribbon and make it look a little more spruce,"
436,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,when she got her money.
437,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
438,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"Lettice now put on her bonnet, and Myra's shawl, and looking into the"
439,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"little three-penny glass which hung on the wall, she thought she might"
440,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,look quite tidy after all. The young lady for whom she made the linen
441,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"lived about twenty miles from town, but she had come in about this"
442,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"time, and was to set off home at nine o'clock that very morning. The"
443,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"linen was to have been sent in the night before, but Lettice had found"
444,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,it impossible to finish it. This was why she was obliged to start so
445,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,early in the morning. She now goes to the bed to tell Myra about the
446,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"fire, and that she had borrowed her shawl, but Myra was sound asleep,"
447,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"so she did not disturb her, but stepped lightly over the floor and"

467,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,on her way with the work she had finished for the young lady. It was
468,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"a cold morning, the snow blew, and the street was slippery. She could"
469,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"scarcely stand--her face was cold, and her hands so numbed that she"
470,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,could scarcely hold the parcel she carried. The snow beat upon her
471,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"poor bonnet, but she comforted herself with the idea that she might be"
472,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,supposed to have a better bonnet at home. She cheerfully trudged
473,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"along, and at last entered Grosvenor Square, where the lamps were just"
474,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"dying away before the splendid houses, while the wind rushed down the"
475,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,Park colder than ever. A few boys were about the only people yet to be
476,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"seen about, and they laughed at her as she held her bonnet down with"
477,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"one hand, to prevent its giving way before the wind, while she carried"
478,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,her bundle and kept her shawl from flying up with the other.
479,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,
480,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"At last she entered Green Street, and came to the house of the kind"

484,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,houses where she had been met with incivility by the domestics.
485,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,
486,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"But ""like master, like man,"" is a stale old proverb, and full of"

489,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"gentle, that before hearing her errand, observing how cold she looked,"
490,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,bade her come in and warm herself at the hall stove.

495,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,
496,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"""Well, my dear, I hope not,"" said the servant, ""but it was a pity you"

499,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,
500,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"As Reynolds, the servant-man, entered the drawing-room, Lettice heard"

590,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,who has tender feelings can bear to see the horse abused. It is wicked
591,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"for any one to do so. A horse has a good memory, and he will never"
592,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,forget a kind master. Jonas Carter is one of those boys who likes to
593,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,take care of a horse. His father gave Jonas the whole care of an
594,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,excellent animal which he purchased for his own use. Every morning he
595,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,would go into the stable to feed and water him. As all the horses in
596,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"the neighborhood had names, Jonas gave one to his, and called him"
597,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"Major. Every time he went into the stable to take care of him, Major"
598,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"would whine and paw, as if his best friend was coming to see him."
599,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"Jonas kept him very clean and nice, so that he was always ready for"
600,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"use at any time of day. At night he made up his bed of straw, and kept"
601,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,the stable warm in winter and cool in summer. Major soon found that
602,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"he was in the hands of a kind master, and being well fed, and well"
603,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"cleansed, he would often show how proud and nice he was, by playing"
604,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,with Jonas in the yard. His young master would often let him loose in
605,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"the yard, and when Jonas started to go in, the horse, Major, would"
606,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"follow him to the door, and when he turned him into the pasture, no"
607,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,one could so well catch him as Jonas; for every time he took him from
608,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"the pasture, Jonas would give him some oats; so when he saw his master"
609,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"coming for him, he remembered the oats, and would come directly to"
610,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"him. Some horses are very difficult to bridle, but it was not so with"
611,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"Major. When Jonas came with the bridle, Major would hold his head"
612,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"down, and take in his bitts, and appear as docile as a lamb. He well"
613,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"knew that Jonas never drove him hard, but always used him kindly."
614,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,Jonas was not a selfish boy; he was willing to let his friends ride a

633,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,
634,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,Edward Ford owned a snug little cottage with a small farm situated
635,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"about a mile from the village. When he was married to Ellen G----, who"
636,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"was said to be one of the best girls in the village, he took her to"
637,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"his nice little home, where he had every thing around very pleasant"
638,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,and comfortable. Ellen was very industrious and remarkable for her
639,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"prudence and neatness. She spun and churned, and tended her poultry,"
640,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"and would often carry her butter and eggs herself to market, which"
641,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"greatly added to their comfort. She had a beautiful little girl, and"
642,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,they gave her the name of Lily. Things glided smoothly on until Lily
643,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,was sixteen. Edward was very fond of the violin and of reading books
644,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"that were not very useful, and as he was very fond of music, he spent"
645,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,a great deal more time in making music and playing the violin than
646,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"what his wife thought profitable. Ellen loved music, and was willing"
647,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"to have him read profitable books, but all this while she thought he"
648,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,might be patching up the fences and improving the shed for the better
649,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"comfort of the cattle. Still she would not complain, hoping all the"
650,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,time that he would see the necessity of being a little more
651,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"industrious. The winter came, and all through its dreary months he was"
652,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"unable to work, as he was sick. And although Ellen worked hard, yet"
653,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"her husband required so much of her attention, that all her efforts"
654,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,availed not much to keep poverty out of their cottage. When the spring
655,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"came, Ellen's husband was able to be about again, and she began to"
656,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"hope that Edward would be more industrious, and they would be able by"
657,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"strict economy to repair the loss occasioned by his winter's illness,"
658,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,which had put them so far behind-hand. Edward had become lazy or
659,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,disheartened. Affairs about the house continued to grow worse; his
660,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"farm was ill worked or neglected, and by the fall, his horse and oxen"
661,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"had to go for necessary expenses. Ellen still kept her cows, but it"
662,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,was now very little help she received from her husband. He had been
663,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"formerly one of the most temperate of men, but now he spent his days"
664,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,from home; and here lay Ellen's deepest sorrow. He was often at the
665,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"village tavern, wasting in senseless riot the time, health and means"

723,THE MARKET DAY.,was a very cold day. For a time the children got along very well; but
724,THE MARKET DAY.,"soon the wood was all burned, not a stick or chip remained; as their"
725,THE MARKET DAY.,"father had gone away in the morning without splitting any, so they"
726,THE MARKET DAY.,were obliged to do the best they could. The baby began to look as if

731,THE MARKET DAY.,
732,THE MARKET DAY.,Hetty was eleven years old. Lily put the baby in the cradle and then
733,THE MARKET DAY.,"went out with Hetty to roll in the log. They rolled it up to the step,"
734,THE MARKET DAY.,"and got it part way into the door, but, alas! they could not get it"
735,THE MARKET DAY.,"further. There it stuck in the doorway, and the door was wide open;"

738,THE MARKET DAY.,
739,THE MARKET DAY.,Something must now be done. Hetty put on her cloak and hood and set
740,THE MARKET DAY.,out for her mother; for she told them if anything happened to be sure
741,THE MARKET DAY.,"and come for her. Hetty soon found her mother at the village store,"
742,THE MARKET DAY.,"and without stopping to warm herself, she said:"
743,THE MARKET DAY.,
744,THE MARKET DAY.,"""O mother, come home, for little Eddy is sick, and Lily says it is the"

748,THE MARKET DAY.,
749,THE MARKET DAY.,Hetty and her mother hastened home; and as they were crossing the
750,THE MARKET DAY.,street there was her husband just entering the tavern. She told him
751,THE MARKET DAY.,"about little Eddy, and he promised to go for a physician and to come"
752,THE MARKET DAY.,"home immediately; and by the time they had gone half way home, Edward,"

757,THE MARKET DAY.,which Hetty thought was in the pond when she left home. To their
758,THE MARKET DAY.,"surprise the log was rolled away from the door, and as Mrs. Ford"
759,THE MARKET DAY.,"opened the door with a trembling hand, fearing her baby was dead,"
760,THE MARKET DAY.,"there was a young man sitting by a good fire, which he had made while"
761,THE MARKET DAY.,"Hetty was gone, with little Eddy folded in his arms. The anxious"

764,THE MARKET DAY.,
765,THE MARKET DAY.,"""Is he dead?"""

1040,BERTIE'S BOX.,"He replied, ""Oh, give half to God and half to the children, and be"

1042,BERTIE'S BOX.,purchase of the Bible--and a collecting box made in the form of a
1043,BERTIE'S BOX.,"Bible; for, said he, ""when my friends come and give money to the"

1093,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,Anne was the daughter of a wealthy farmer. She had a good New England
1094,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"school education, and was well bred and well taught at home in the"
1095,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,virtues and manners that constitute domestic social life. Her father
1096,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,died a year before her marriage. He left a will dividing his property
1097,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"equally between his son and daughter, giving to the son the homestead"
1098,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"with all its accumulated riches, and to the daughter the largest share"
1099,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,of the personal property amounting to 6 or 7000 dollars. This little
1100,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,fortune became at Anne's marriage the property of her husband. It
1101,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,would seem that the property of a woman received from her father
1102,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,should be her's. But the laws of a barbarous age fixed it otherwise.
1103,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,
1104,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"Anne married John Warren, who was the youngest child, daintly bred"
1105,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,by his parents. He opened a dry good store in a small town in the
1106,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"vicinity of B----, where he invested Annie's property. He was a farmer,"
1107,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,and did not think of the qualifications necessary to a successful
1108,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"merchant. For five or six years he went on tolerably, living _genteelly_"
1109,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"and _recklessly_, expecting that every year's gain would make up the"
1110,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"excess of the past. When sixteen years of their married life had passed,"
1111,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,they were living in a single room in the crowded street of R----.
1112,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,Every penny of the inheritance was gone--three children had died--three
1113,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"survived; a girl of fifteen years, whom the mother was educating to be"
1114,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"a teacher--a boy of twelve who was living at home, and Jessy, a pale,"
1115,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"delicate, little struggler for life, three years old."
1116,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,
1117,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,Mrs. W---- was much changed in these sixteen years. Her round blooming
1118,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"cheek was pale and sunken, her dark chestnut hair had become thin and"
1119,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"gray, her bright eyes, over-tasked by use and watching, were faded,"
1120,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,and her whole person shrunken. Yet she had gained a great victory.
1121,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"Yes, it was a precious pearl. And you will wish to know what it was."
1122,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,It was a gentle submission and resignation--a patience under all her

1241,MY EARLY DAYS.,My father's house was indeed a pleasant home; and father was the

1243,MY EARLY DAYS.,firm and resolute when the case demanded. Mother was the sunshine of
1244,MY EARLY DAYS.,our little garden of love; her talents and energy gave her influence;
1245,MY EARLY DAYS.,"and united to a man like father, she was all that is loveable in the"
1246,MY EARLY DAYS.,character of woman.

1249,MY EARLY DAYS.,
1250,MY EARLY DAYS.,"But the dear old home, where I grew from infancy to boyhood, and from"
1251,MY EARLY DAYS.,"boyhood to youth, I shall never forget. It was a large house on the"
1252,MY EARLY DAYS.,"slope of a hill, just high enough to overlook several miles of our"
1253,MY EARLY DAYS.,"level country, and smooth enough with its soft grassy carpet for us to"
1254,MY EARLY DAYS.,roll down from the summit to the foot of the hill. At the back of the
1255,MY EARLY DAYS.,"house was another hill, where we used to roll under the shade of the"
1256,MY EARLY DAYS.,"old elm, and where Miles and I would sit whole afternoons and fly the"
1257,MY EARLY DAYS.,"kite, each taking turns in bolding the string. This was a happy place"
1258,MY EARLY DAYS.,"for us, and especially in the spring time, when the happy looking"
1259,MY EARLY DAYS.,cows grazed along the pathway which winds around the elm to the stream
1260,MY EARLY DAYS.,where Kate and I used to sail my little boat. All summer long this
1261,MY EARLY DAYS.,"place was vocal with the songs of birds, which built their nests in"
1262,MY EARLY DAYS.,safety among the tall trees of the grove in the rear of the farm. We
1263,MY EARLY DAYS.,"had also the music of the running brook, and the pleasant hum of my"
1264,MY EARLY DAYS.,"father's cotton mill, which brought us in our daily bread. Haying time"
1265,MY EARLY DAYS.,"was always a happy season for us boys. Father's two horses, ""_Dick_"""
1266,MY EARLY DAYS.,"and ""_Bonny_"" would take off the farm as large a load of hay as any in"
1267,MY EARLY DAYS.,the village.
1268,MY EARLY DAYS.,
1269,MY EARLY DAYS.,"Years past on, and we were a happy band of brothers and sisters. After"
1270,MY EARLY DAYS.,"Kate, came the twins, Margaret and Herbert, and last of all came the"
1271,MY EARLY DAYS.,"youngest darling, blue eyed Dora. We had a happy childhood. Our"
1272,MY EARLY DAYS.,station in the world was high enough to enable us to have all the
1273,MY EARLY DAYS.,harmless pleasures and studies that were useful and actually necessary
1274,MY EARLY DAYS.,to boys and girls of our station. Father always thought that it was
1275,MY EARLY DAYS.,"better in early youth not to force the boys to too hard study, and"

1277,MY EARLY DAYS.,"fabricating garments, than in playing the harp. We were free, happy,"

1279,MY EARLY DAYS.,"fashionable life. We had no costly dresses to spoil, and were"
1280,MY EARLY DAYS.,"permitted to play in the green fields without a servant's eye, and to"
1281,MY EARLY DAYS.,bathe in the clear shallow stream without fear of drowning. As I have
1282,MY EARLY DAYS.,"said before, these were happy days; and when I think of them gone, I"

1378,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"More, at Barley Wood. When they were about to leave, Mrs. M. stooped"
1379,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"to kiss the little boy, not as a mere compliment, as old maids usually"
1380,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"kiss children, but she took his smiling face between her two hands,"
1381,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"and looked upon it a moment as a mother would, then kissed it fondly"
1382,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"more than once. ""Now when you are a man, my child, will you remember"
1383,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"me?"" The little boy had just been eating some cake which she gave him,"
1384,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"and he, instead of giving her any answer, glanced his eyes on the"
1385,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"remnants of the cake which lay on the table. ""Well,"" said Mrs. M.,"
1386,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"""you will remember the cake at Barley Wood, wont you?"" ""Yes,"" said the"
1387,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"boy, ""It was nice cake, and you are _so kind_ that I will remember"
1388,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"both."" ""That is right,"" she replied, ""I like to have the young"
1389,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,remember me for _being kin_--then you will remember old Mrs. Hannah
1390,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"More?"""
1391,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,
1392,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"""Always, ma'am, I'll try to remember you always."" ""What a good child"""
1393,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"said she, after his mother was gone, ""and of good stock; that child"
1394,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,will be as true as steel. It was so much more natural that the child
1395,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"should remember the cake than an old woman, that I love his"
1396,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"sincerity."" She died on the 7th of Sept., 1833, aged eighty-eight."
1397,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,"She was buried in Wrighton churchyard, beneath an old tree which is"
1398,REMEMBER THE CAKE.,still flourishing.

1409,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,
1410,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"One of his sisters who had been married some time, came with her babe"
1411,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,to spend a few days at her father's. When the child was asleep in the
1412,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"cradle, Mrs. West invited her daughter to gather flowers in the"
1413,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"garden, and told Benjamin to take care of the little child while they"
1414,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,were gone; and gave him a fan to flap away the flies from his little
1415,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"charge. After some time the child appeared to smile in its sleep, and"
1416,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"it attracted young Benney's attention, he was so pleased with the"
1417,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"smiling, sleeping babe, that he thought he would see what he could do"
1418,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,at drawing a portrait of it. He was only in his seventh year; he got
1419,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"some paper, pens, and some red and black ink, and commenced his work,"
1420,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,and soon drew the picture of the babe.
1421,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,
1422,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"Hearing his mother and sister coming in from the garden, he hid his"
1423,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,picture; but his mother seeing he was confused; asked him what he was
1424,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"about, and requested him to show her the paper. He obeyed, and"
1425,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"entreated her not to be angry. Mrs. West, after looking some time,"
1426,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"with much pleasure, said to her daughter, ""I declare, he has made a"
1427,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"likeness of _little Sally_,"" and kissed him with evident satisfaction."
1428,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"This gave him much encouragement, and he would often draw pictures of"
1429,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,flowers which she held in her hand. Here the instinct of his great
1430,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,genius was first awakened. This circumstance occurred in the midst of
1431,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"a Pennsylvania forest, a hundred and four years ago. At the age of"
1432,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,eighteen he was fairly established in the city of Philadelphia as an

1446,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,roomy. Around it is a trim little garden with pleasant flower borders
1447,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,under the low windows. From the cottage is a bright lookout into a
1448,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,distant scene of much variety.
1449,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,
1450,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"Some years ago it was more desolate, as it was so isolated from the"
1451,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,world. Now the children's voices blend with the song of the wood
1452,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"birds, and they have a garden there of dandelions, daisies, and"
1453,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"flowers. The roof and walls are now covered with stone crop and moss,"

1456,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"a blooming appearance. This house, with forty acres of land, some"
1457,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"rocky and sterile, and some rich meadow and peat, formed the"
1458,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,possessions of the Prestons in Westmoreland. For two hundred years
1459,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,this land had been theirs. Mr. Preston and his wife were industrious
1460,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"and respectable people. They had two children, Martha and John. The"
1461,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,sister eight years older than her brother and acted a motherly part
1462,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"towards him. As her mother had to go to market, to see to the cows and"
1463,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"dairy, and to look after the sheep on the fell; Martha took most of"
1464,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,the care of little Johnny.
1465,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,
1466,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,It is said that a very active mother does not _always_ make a very
1467,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"active daughter, and that is because she does things herself, and has"
1468,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,but little patience with the awkward and slow efforts of a learner.
1469,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,Mrs. Preston said that Martha was too long in going to market with the
1470,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"butter, and she made the bread too thick, and did not press all the"
1471,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"water out of the butter, and she folded up the fleeces the wrong way,"
1472,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,and therefore she did all herself. Hence Martha was left to take the
1473,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"whole care of Johnny, and to roam about in the woods. When she was"
1474,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"about fifteen her mother died, so that Martha was left her mother's"
1475,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"place in the house, which she filled beyond the expectation of all the"
1476,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"neighbors. Her father died when Johnny was sixteen, and his last"
1477,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"advice to his daughter was, to take care of her brother, to look after"
1478,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"his worldly affairs, and above all to bear his soul in prayer to"
1479,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"heaven, where he hoped to meet the household once more. The share of"
1480,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"her father's property when he died, was eighty pounds. Here Martha"
1481,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"spent her days, frugal, industrious and benevolent. And it is said,"

1494,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"One winter's night when the evening had shut in very early, owing to"
1495,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"the black snow clouds that hung close around the horizon, Martha sat"
1496,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"looking into the fire. Her old sheep dog, Fly, lay at her feet. The"
1497,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"cows were foddered for the night, and the sheep were penned up in the"
1498,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"yard. Fly was a faithful dog, and for some reason, this evening, he"
1499,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"was very restless. Why he pricked up his ears, and went snuffing to"
1500,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"the door, and pacing about the room, was more than Martha could tell."
1501,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,
1502,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"""Lie down. Fly,--good dog--lie down,"" she said; but Fly would not mind"
1503,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"her, which was an unusual thing. She was certain something was the"
1504,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"matter, and she felt she must go up to the fell; and with the"
1505,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"foresight common to the Dale's people, who knew what mountain storms"
1506,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"are, she took under her cloak a small vial of gin, which was kept in"
1507,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"case of any accident, and set out with the dog Fly. The snow fell"
1508,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"fast, the wind blew, and the drifts lay thick. She had great"
1509,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"confidence in Fly, that if any thing was the matter he would find it"
1510,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,out. He ran straight up the little steep path which led through the
1511,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"woods. On she followed, her cloak white with snow, until she came,"
1512,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"into the more open ground, where she lost sight of Fly and for a time"
1513,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"stood bewildered, until he should return and guide her. The birds and"
1514,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"beasts had gone to rest, and the stillness of the moors was awful. It"
1515,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"was night, and dark. Suddenly she heard a child's feeble voice, and in"
1516,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,an instant she pressed on towards the spot from which the sound came;
1517,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"soon she heard Fly's loud howl for aid. At last she reached the spot,"
1518,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"and found a little boy half asleep, a kind of drowsiness which"
1519,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,precedes death. He could not speak; he could only moan. She moistened
1520,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"his lips with the gin, and poured a little down his throat. She then"
1521,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,raised him up and carried him a short distance down the hill; then she
1522,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"stopped to rest awhile; and then she got as far as the woods, where"
1523,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,the winds were not so cold. Again she gave him a few drops from her
1524,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"vial, and now he was able to walk a few steps; then Martha, put up a"
1525,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"fervent prayer to God for assistance, as she dragged the lost boy"
1526,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"to her cottage. She now laid him down to the warm fire, while Fly"
1527,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"snuffed around him in great joy. She took off his wet clothes, and"
1528,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,wrapped him in her woollen cloak. He soon recovered and was able to

1690,THE GLOW WORM.,"On a summer's evening about half an hour after bed time, as three"
1691,THE GLOW WORM.,little brothers lay talking together they heard a gentle footstep on
1692,THE GLOW WORM.,"the stairs. It was their sister Lucy. ""Are you asleep,"" she asked."
1693,THE GLOW WORM.,
1694,THE GLOW WORM.,"""No, we are not asleep,"" cried the boys."
1695,THE GLOW WORM.,
1696,THE GLOW WORM.,"""I have brought something to show you"" said Lucy, and going into the"
1697,THE GLOW WORM.,"darkest corner of the room, she opened her hand and the boys saw"
1698,THE GLOW WORM.,something sparkle like a diamond or a star.
1699,THE GLOW WORM.,
1700,THE GLOW WORM.,"""What is it,"" cried little Frank, jumping out of bed and running to"
1701,THE GLOW WORM.,"look. Lucy held out her hand, but told him not to touch it."
1702,THE GLOW WORM.,
1703,THE GLOW WORM.,"""Oh, it moves! It moves!"" said he ""It must be something alive."""
1704,THE GLOW WORM.,
1705,THE GLOW WORM.,"""Ah!"" said John, ""it is a glow worm. I saw one last summer on a bank"
1706,THE GLOW WORM.,"in Sand Lee."""
1707,THE GLOW WORM.,
1708,THE GLOW WORM.,"""Take care,"" said Frank, ""that it does not burn the counterpane."" The"
1709,THE GLOW WORM.,two elder brothers laughed; but Lucy reminded them that they would
1710,THE GLOW WORM.,"most likely have fallen into the same mistake, if they had not been"
1711,THE GLOW WORM.,"taught that the glow worm's light, though it shines so brightly, does"
1712,THE GLOW WORM.,not burn. To convince Frank she told him to hold out his hand. The
1713,THE GLOW WORM.,"little boy felt afraid, but as he knew that Lucy never deceived him,"
1714,THE GLOW WORM.,"he put out his hand, and soon, to his great delight, the harmless"
1715,THE GLOW WORM.,glow worm lay in his hand. Lucy promised to tell him something about
1716,THE GLOW WORM.,"the glow worm another time. Frank went back to his bed, and Lucy bid"
1717,THE GLOW WORM.,"her brothers good night, promising to put the prize under a glass on"
1718,THE GLOW WORM.,the lawn.
1719,THE GLOW WORM.,
1720,THE GLOW WORM.,"So night after night, for weeks, the three boys saw the twinkling"
1721,THE GLOW WORM.,light of the glow worm on the dewy grass. One evening they began to
1722,THE GLOW WORM.,"quarrel about it, and none but little Frank was willing to give up his"
1723,THE GLOW WORM.,claim to it. It grieved him to hear his brothers quarrelling and
1724,THE GLOW WORM.,saying unkind words to each other; and he also thought that the poor
1725,THE GLOW WORM.,"glow worm ought not to be kept a prisoner under the glass, instead of"
1726,THE GLOW WORM.,flying over the green turf or mossy bank. But when he tried to bring
1727,THE GLOW WORM.,"John and Robert to the same opinion, they would not hear to him. So"
1728,THE GLOW WORM.,"Lucy, who was a kind sister, when she found that the pleasure she had"
1729,THE GLOW WORM.,"procured for them was the occasion of their naughty conduct, sat down"
1730,THE GLOW WORM.,"by the window and told them to remember that God, who made the glow"
1731,THE GLOW WORM.,"worm and caused its light to shine, could see them in their chamber,"
1732,THE GLOW WORM.,and hear every sinful word. John and Robert felt the force of their
1733,THE GLOW WORM.,"sister's words, and settled their quarrel without delay, and they gave"
1734,THE GLOW WORM.,Frank permission to go early in the morning and let the imprisoned
1735,THE GLOW WORM.,glow worm creep away.

1744,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,In the suburbs of the city of B. stands the beautiful residence of Mr.
1745,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"James. It was a rural spot, as it was surrounded with all the beauties"
1746,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"of nature. There were rippling streams, and winding paths through the"
1747,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"green fields and woods, sunny hills and mossy rocks. Emily, the only"
1748,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"daughter of Mr. J., had all these pleasant scenes to enjoy, and every"
1749,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,thing to make her home happy. Her father owned a noble pair of grays
1750,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"and a very fine carriage, and she had the pleasure of riding with her"
1751,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,father whenever she chose. But Emily did not live altogether for her
1752,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,own happiness; she was accustomed to go and see the people in the
1753,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"neighborhood of her home, and if any were poor or sick she would"
1754,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,always try to benefit them.
1755,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1756,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,Her mother had to put up many a bundle of nice things for her to take
1757,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"to some poor family in need. She was also fond of the works of nature,"
1758,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,and would frequently spend an hour in walking alone in the shady rural
1759,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"places in her town. One day, as the beautiful spring had just unfolded"
1760,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"its loveliness, Emily thought she would walk out and breathe the"
1761,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,delicious air. With a heart laden with good thoughts and with a quick
1762,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,step she passed along the gravelled street and by the cultivated
1763,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"grounds and fine houses, until she reached the green turf and wooded"
1764,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"slopes, and here paused awhile under the large old trees, and thought"
1765,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"of the wisdom, goodness, and love of God in giving us such a beautiful"
1766,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,earth.
1767,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1768,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"On her route, where the river curved around the foot of a gentle"
1769,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"sloping hill in the shadows of old forest trees, was made a rural"
1770,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,cemetery; so pleasant were its quiet paths and its cool shades in
1771,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"summer, that the living loved to wander there. Friends came there to"
1772,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,plant flowers upon the graves of dear ones they had lost.
1773,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1774,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"Through a low ivy covered gateway of stone, Emily entered the quiet"
1775,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"place. There were no massive railings, and lofty monuments, and no"
1776,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"costly devices, but God had made this place very beautiful--flowers"
1777,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"were blooming along the well trodden paths, and around the last"
1778,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,resting places of the dead. Here and there arose a simple shaft or a
1779,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"light column, and the graves of the household were bordered by a green"
1780,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,hedge or surrounded by shadowing trees.
1781,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1782,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"As Emily passed through the familiar walks, she came suddenly to a"
1783,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"grave in the remote corner of the cemetery, beside which sat a"
1784,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,solitary mourner. A small white slab lay upon the centre of the green
1785,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"mound and at its head grew a rose bush in bloom, bending, till its"
1786,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,weight of white buds and blossoms touched the long bright grass upon
1787,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"the grave. Emily attracted by its simply beauty, and drawing near, she"
1788,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"stooped down and read upon the marble slab, ""Dear Mina."" Her young"
1789,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"eyes filled instantly with tears, for she knew that it was the darling"
1790,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,child of a lady who to her was a stranger. As she turned away from the
1791,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"spot she met a lady approaching, who passed her and kneeled down"
1792,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"beside the grave. She thought she would speak to the lady, and with"
1793,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"tender sympathy she asked, ""Was it your child?"""
1794,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1795,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"The lady, who was deep in thought, looked up at the sound of Emily's"
1796,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"earnest voice, and answered, softly, ""yes; 'Dear Mina' was my only"
1797,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"child."" This interview led Emily to an acquaintance with the sorrowing"
1798,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"mother, which caused her never to forget her morning ramble. She was a"
1799,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"good woman, and at the decease of Emily's mother became her Christian"

2119,THE TWO ROBINS.,heard a strange noise among the highest branches of the tree over my
2120,THE TWO ROBINS.,"head. The sound was very curious, and I began to look for the cause. I"
2121,THE TWO ROBINS.,"shook one of the lower branches within my reach, and very soon I"
2122,THE TWO ROBINS.,discovered two birds engaged in fighting; and they seemed to gradually
2123,THE TWO ROBINS.,"descend towards the ground. They came down lower and lower, tumbling"
2124,THE TWO ROBINS.,"over one another, and fighting with each other. They soon reached the"
2125,THE TWO ROBINS.,"lowest branch, and at last came to the ground very near me. It was"
2126,THE TWO ROBINS.,with some difficulty that I parted them; and when I held one of them
2127,THE TWO ROBINS.,"in each of my hands, they tried to get away, not because they were"
2128,THE TWO ROBINS.,afraid of me but because they would resume the conflict. They were two
2129,THE TWO ROBINS.,"young robins, and I never before thought that the robin had such a bad"
2130,THE TWO ROBINS.,"spirit in its breast. Lest they should get to fighting again, I let"
2131,THE TWO ROBINS.,"one go, and kept the other housed up for several days, so that they"

2158,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"Down by the sea-coast is the pleasant town of Saco, Where Mr. Aimes"
2159,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,has resided for many years. Once a year he had all his little nephews
2160,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"and nieces visit him. It was their holiday, and they would think and"
2161,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,talk about the visit for a long time previous to going there. Their
2162,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,uncle took much pleasure in making them happy as possible while they
2163,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,were with him. He owned a pleasure sail boat which he always kept in
2164,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,good order. On this occasion he had it all clean and prepared for the
2165,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"young friends, as he knew they lotted much on having a sail. As his"
2166,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"boat was small, he took part of them at a time and went out with them"
2167,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"himself, a short distance, and sailed around the island, and returned."
2168,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"In the picture you see them just going out, with their uncle at the"
2169,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"helm, while three of the nephews are on the beach enjoying the scene."
2170,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,
2171,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,But I must tell you children to be very careful when you go on the
2172,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,water to sail. There are some things which it is necessary for you to
2173,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"know, as a great many accidents occur on the water for the want of"
2174,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"right management. When you go to sail, be sure and have persons with"
2175,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"you who understand all about a boat, and how to manage in the time of"
2176,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,"a squall. Always keep your seats in the boat, and not be running about"
2177,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,in it. Never get to rocking a boat in the water. A great many people
2178,THE PLEASANT SAIL.,have lost their lives by so doing. Sailing on the water may be very

2192,THE SAILOR BOY.,Yarmouth is the principal trade sea-port town in the county of
2193,THE SAILOR BOY.,"Norfolk. Fishermen reside in the towns and villages around, and among"
2194,THE SAILOR BOY.,"the number was a poor man and his wife; they had an only son, and when"
2195,THE SAILOR BOY.,"ten years old his father died. The poor widow, in the death of her"
2196,THE SAILOR BOY.,"husband, lost the means of support. After some time she said to her"
2197,THE SAILOR BOY.,"boy, ""Johnny, I do not see how I shall support you."" ""Then, mother, I"
2198,THE SAILOR BOY.,"will go to sea,"" he replied. His mother was loth to part with Johnny,"
2199,THE SAILOR BOY.,for he was a good son and was very kind to her. But she at last
2200,THE SAILOR BOY.,consented on his going to sea.
2201,THE SAILOR BOY.,
2202,THE SAILOR BOY.,John began to make preparations. One day he went down to the beach
2203,THE SAILOR BOY.,hoping to find a chance among some of the captains to sail. He went to
2204,THE SAILOR BOY.,"the owner of one and asked if he wanted a boy. ""No,"" he abruptly"
2205,THE SAILOR BOY.,"replied ""I have boys enough."" He tried a second but without success."
2206,THE SAILOR BOY.,John now began to weep. After some time he saw on the quay the captain
2207,THE SAILOR BOY.,"of a trading vessel to St. Petersburg, and John asked him if ""a boy"
2208,THE SAILOR BOY.,"was wanted."" ""Oh, yes,"" said the captain, ""but I never take a boy or a"
2209,THE SAILOR BOY.,"man without a character."" John had a Testament among his things, which"
2210,THE SAILOR BOY.,"he took out and said to the captain, ""I suppose this won't do."" The"
2211,THE SAILOR BOY.,"captain took it, and on opening the first page, saw written, ""_John"
2212,THE SAILOR BOY.,"Read, given as a reward for his good behaviour and diligence in"
2213,THE SAILOR BOY.,"learning, at the Sabbath School_."" The captain said, ""Yes, my boy,"
2214,THE SAILOR BOY.,"this will do; I would rather have this recommendation than any other,"""
2215,THE SAILOR BOY.,"adding, ""you may go on board directly."" John's heart leaped for joy,"
2216,THE SAILOR BOY.,"as, with his bundle under his arm, he jumped on board the vessel."
2217,THE SAILOR BOY.,
2218,THE SAILOR BOY.,"The vessel was soon under weigh, and for some time the sky was bright,"
2219,THE SAILOR BOY.,and the wind was fair. When they reached the Baltic Sea a storm came
2220,THE SAILOR BOY.,"on, the wind raged furiously, all hands were employed to save the"
2221,THE SAILOR BOY.,"vessel. But the storm increased, and the captain thought all would be"
2222,THE SAILOR BOY.,lost. While things were in this state the little sailor boy was
2223,THE SAILOR BOY.,missing. One of the crew told the captain he was down in the cabin.
2224,THE SAILOR BOY.,When sent for he came up with his Testament in his hand and asked the
2225,THE SAILOR BOY.,captain if he might read. His request was granted. He then knelt down
2226,THE SAILOR BOY.,and rend the sixtieth and sixty-first Psalms. While he was reading the
2227,THE SAILOR BOY.,"wind began to abate, (the storms in the Baltic abate as suddenly as"
2228,THE SAILOR BOY.,"they come on.) The captain was much moved, and said he believed the"
2229,THE SAILOR BOY.,boy's reading was heard in Heaven.

2395,YOUNG USHER.,"You have read of that remarkable man, Mr. Usher, who was Archbishop of"
2396,YOUNG USHER.,Armagh. I will tell you something about his early childhood. He was
2397,YOUNG USHER.,"born in Dublin, in the year 1580, and when a little boy he was fond of"
2398,YOUNG USHER.,"reading. He lived with his two aunts who were born blind, and who"
2399,YOUNG USHER.,acquired much knowledge of the Scriptures by hearing others read the
2400,YOUNG USHER.,Scriptures and other good books. At seven years of age he was sent to
2401,YOUNG USHER.,school in Dublin; at the end of five years he was superior in study to
2402,YOUNG USHER.,"any of his school fellows, and was thought fully qualified to enter"
2403,YOUNG USHER.,the college at Dublin.
2404,YOUNG USHER.,
2405,YOUNG USHER.,"While he was at college he learned to play at cards, and he was so"
2406,YOUNG USHER.,much taken up with this amusement that both his learning and piety
2407,YOUNG USHER.,"were much endangered. He saw the evil tendency of playing cards, and"
2408,YOUNG USHER.,at once relinquished the practice entirely. When he was nine years
2409,YOUNG USHER.,"old, he heard a sermon preached which made a deep impression on his"
2410,YOUNG USHER.,mind. From that time he was accustomed to habits of devotion. He loved
2411,YOUNG USHER.,"to pray, and felt that he could not sleep quietly without first"
2412,YOUNG USHER.,commending himself to the care of his Heavenly father for protection.
2413,YOUNG USHER.,"When he was fourteen years old, he began to think about partaking of"
2414,YOUNG USHER.,the Lord's supper. He thought this act to be a very solemn and
2415,YOUNG USHER.,"important one, and required a thorough preparation. On the afternoon"
2416,YOUNG USHER.,"previous to the communion, he would retire to some private place for"
2417,YOUNG USHER.,"self examination and prayer. When he was but sixteen years of age, he"
2418,YOUNG USHER.,obtained such a knowledge of chronology as to have commenced the
2419,YOUNG USHER.,"annals of the Old and New Testaments, which were published many years"
2420,YOUNG USHER.,"after, and are now a general standard of reference."
2421,YOUNG USHER.,
2422,YOUNG USHER.,"When his father died, he being the eldest son, the paternal estate was"
2423,YOUNG USHER.,left to him to manage. But as he feared it would occupy to much of his
2424,YOUNG USHER.,"time and attention, he gave it entirely to his brother and sisters,"
2425,YOUNG USHER.,reserving only enough for his books and college expenses. At the age
2426,YOUNG USHER.,"of twenty he entered the ministry, and seven years after was chosen a"
2427,YOUNG USHER.,"professor in the University of Dublin. In 1640, he visited England at"
2428,YOUNG USHER.,the time of the commencement of the rebellion; all his goods were
2429,YOUNG USHER.,"seized by the popish party, except some furniture in his house, and"
2430,YOUNG USHER.,"his library at Drogheda, which was afterwards sent to London. He bore"
2431,YOUNG USHER.,"his loss with submission, but he never returned to Ireland. He had"
2432,YOUNG USHER.,"many trials to endure on account of the troublous times in England,"
2433,YOUNG USHER.,(it being the time of civil wars.) In 1646 he received a kind
2434,YOUNG USHER.,invitation from the Countess of Peterborough to reside in one of her
2435,YOUNG USHER.,"houses, which proposal he accepted and lived in one of them till his"
2436,YOUNG USHER.,"death, in 1665. By the direction of Cromwell he was buried in"

2528,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,I wish to relate to you a very affecting story about a good girl who
2529,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,died when she was thirteen years old. She was an interesting young
2530,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"girl, and possessed great intellectual powers. She was also very fond"
2531,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"of the works of nature, especially of flowers, and would often say,"
2532,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"""How good God is to make these beautiful flowers for us to enjoy."""
2533,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,Soon it was very evident to her friends that disease was preying on
2534,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,her delicate constitution. She bore all her sickness with calm
2535,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"submission, and when she died she appeared to all who knew her to be"
2536,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"prepared for heaven. While she was sick, her parents did every thing"
2537,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,to make her comfortable and happy. They had a dog which Lizzy set a
2538,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"great deal by, and with him she used to play in the house and in the"
2539,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"garden. When Lizzy was so sick that she could not play with him, he"
2540,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"would come and lay himself down at her bed side, and appeared to be"
2541,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"very sad on her account. When she died [and] was buried, the dog"

2949,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,kindness and liberality:
2950,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,
2951,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"While he resided in Bristol, his father, Dr. Terry, took little"
2952,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,Emerson with him to ride into Hartford that he might see the city.
2953,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"Emerson had one dollar, and it was the first dollar he ever earned. He"
2954,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"took the dollar with him, thinking to buy something with it in the"
2955,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"city. While they were riding along on the way, they overtook a poor"
2956,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,fugitive slave seeking his freedom in the North. Mr. Terry kindly took
2957,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,the wayfaring man into his carriage when the poor man related to him
2958,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"his sufferings and poverty, and also his trust in God. Young Emerson's"
2959,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"heart was touched, when, of his own accord, he drew out his _first_"
2960,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,and _only_ dollar and gave it to the poor fugitive. When he returned
2961,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"home he told his mother what he had done, with a satisfaction that"
2962,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,indicated his pleasure in being able to relieve a suffering stranger.
2963,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,How noble was this act. He felt willing to forego the pleasure of
2964,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"spending his dollar for himself, for any pleasing toys that he might"
2965,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"help a poor wanderer on the earth. When he was fifteen years of age,"

3064,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"when it came round, to assist in sending the gospel to the heathen"

3249,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3250,THE TRUSTY DOG.,But I must not forget the work I commenced; and run off into telling
3251,THE TRUSTY DOG.,you stories of bad children rather than of the good dog. I know that
3252,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"you are already interested in this noble fellow, by this fine portrait"
3253,THE TRUSTY DOG.,of him. Hasn't he a beautiful face. It is as kind and good natured a

3256,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"that great basket which he holds in his mouth, I will first tell you"
3257,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"his name, and then come to the question of the basket. His name was"
3258,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"""Erie."" Mayhap you never knew a dog by this name. It is very peculiar"
3259,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"to call a dog ""Erie,"" but, as this was an extraordinary wise dog, he"
3260,THE TRUSTY DOG.,deserved a name somewhat different from ordinary dogs.
3261,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3262,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"Now I will proceed to my story which is true, and may be believed as"
3263,THE TRUSTY DOG.,well as wondered at.
3264,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3265,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"""Erie"" had great many wonderful tricks. He seemed to understand what"
3266,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"was said to him, and would obey promptly any person in whom he had"
3267,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"confidence, when they told him to do anything which was in his power"
3268,THE TRUSTY DOG.,to do. You could trust him to carry any article which he could hold in
3269,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"his mouth, He would take it to any place you might name, where he was"
3270,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"accustomed to go, and give to the person you told him to give it to,"
3271,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"and never to any other, under any circumstances. If he could not find"
3272,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"the person to whom the article was sent, he would surely return it to"
3273,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"you with a knowing look which seemed to say, ""I tried to do my errand"
3274,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"but couldn't."" He was usually very good natured, but on such"
3275,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"occasions, when he was entrusted with the care of anything; he did not"
3276,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"like to be interfered with, and if any one attempted to touch anything"
3277,THE TRUSTY DOG.,which he held in his mouth he would growl at them in a most ferocious
3278,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"manner, as if he would say, ""Take care, this is not yours, and I shall"

3280,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"another."""
3281,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3282,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"His master used to love hunting very much, and ""Erie"" almost always"
3283,THE TRUSTY DOG.,went with him. At such times he was very fond of carrying the game bag
3284,THE TRUSTY DOG.,in his mouth. There was a closet in the house where his master kept
3285,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"his guns powder, flasks, and all things necessary for hunting. One day"
3286,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"Mr. A. left for [the] woods with his gun, while the dog was absent"
3287,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"from home. He had gone about a mile, when he thought of his powder"
3288,THE TRUSTY DOG.,flask which in the haste of leaving home he had forgotten. He turned
3289,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"back regretting that he had taken so many unnecessary steps, when his"
3290,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"eye fell upon ""Erie"" running toward him with great speed holding the"
3291,THE TRUSTY DOG.,powder flask in his mouth. The dog had returned home and finding his
3292,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"master gone, had examined the closet, the door of which had been left"
3293,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"ajar, and found the gun gone while the flask was left; he seemed to"
3294,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"know this ought not to be, and seizing the flask in his mouth he"
3295,THE TRUSTY DOG.,pursued his master and carried him the important article.
3296,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3297,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"Mr. A. taught him to carry meat home from the market, and he was never"
3298,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"known to eat it, or allow any other dog to take it from him."
3299,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3300,THE TRUSTY DOG.,This was very convenient for the family. Often when Mr. A. was in
3301,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"haste, he would write a note telling the butcher what meat to send him"
3302,THE TRUSTY DOG.,for his dinner. This note he would put into the bottom of the meat
3303,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"basket, and give the basket to ""Erie,"" telling him which market he was"
3304,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"to go to, and reminding him to be sure and come back quickly. In a few"

3306,THE TRUSTY DOG.,could have done.
3307,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3308,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"One day as he was going home from the market, the basket was heavy,"
3309,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"having in it a large piece of meat. ""Erie"" grew very tired and set the"
3310,THE TRUSTY DOG.,basket down on the pavement to rest his mouth a moment. At this moment
3311,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"a large black dog was passing, who, smelling the meat, thought he"
3312,THE TRUSTY DOG.,would like a piece for his own dinner; so walking up to the basket he
3313,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"attempted to thrust his nose in and help himself. ""Erie"" gave one of"
3314,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"his ferocious warning growls, which said as plain as words, ""Take"
3315,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"care, take care."" At first the other dog retreated a little, but being"
3316,THE TRUSTY DOG.,very hungry he again approached the basket.
3317,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3318,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"""Erie"" seemed really to reason about the matter. He knew that the"
3319,THE TRUSTY DOG.,other dog was determined to steal the meat which was especially
3320,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"entrusted to _his_ care. It was as if he thought to himself, ""Now if I"
3321,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"stop to fight with this dog, some other dog may come and run away with"
3322,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"my meat, my only safety is flight,"" so seizing up the basket he fled"
3323,THE TRUSTY DOG.,as fast as his legs could carry him toward home. The large dog pursued
3324,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"him a little way, but ""Erie"" out-ran him and reached home in safety,"
3325,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"As soon as he had deposited the basket in the hands of his mistress,"
3326,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"he turned and ran down street again as fast as he could, in search of"
3327,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"the thieving dog, whose dishonesty he seemed to think he must punish."
3328,THE TRUSTY DOG.,After searching a long time he found him playing with a number of
3329,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"other dogs, and I never saw a dog take a worse whipping than ""Erie"""
3330,THE TRUSTY DOG.,gave him.
3331,THE TRUSTY DOG.,
3332,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"Now my dear children as you read this story, ask yourselves if you are"
3333,THE TRUSTY DOG.,as honest and trustworthy as this noble dog was. You know that you may
3334,THE TRUSTY DOG.,be much better than he; for God has made you wiser and given you power
3335,THE TRUSTY DOG.,"to do much, more than any animal."

3344,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,Josiah Martin was a young man of whom any mother might have been
3345,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"proud. He was an only child, and had been the support of his widowed"
3346,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,mother for five years; though at the time when we first knew him he
3347,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,was not twenty.
3348,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3349,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"And this was not all. He was so frugal, and industrious, that he was"
3350,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"able, besides providing for himself and mother, to contribute largely"
3351,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"toward the support of his aunt Eleanor and her daughter, who were very"
3352,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"poor, and without his help, might have suffered oftentimes for want of"
3353,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,the necessaries of life.
3354,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3355,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"In return for his care, he had a wealth of love bestowed upon him by"
3356,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"mother, aunt and cousin, who often said, and often felt in their"
3357,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"hearts, that Josiah was as good a boy as ever lived. He enjoyed"
3358,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"perfect health, and had naturally a merry heart, so that every day of"
3359,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"his life, he was as happy as the birds. He expected to continue so,"
3360,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,through many long years: and never thought of dying until he got to be
3361,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,an old man.
3362,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3363,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"One pleasant summer morning, he rose early and prepared to leave home"
3364,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,to be absent a week. He had agreed to go and help Mr. Brown about
3365,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"harvesting, and the farm being five miles from where his mother lived,"
3366,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,he could not come home before Saturday night. He bade his mother an
3367,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"affectionate good morning, and started cheerily on his way. The road"
3368,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"ran by aunt Eleanor's door, so he thought he would just peep in, and"
3369,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,see how she was and tell her that he should not see her again for
3370,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,several days.
3371,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3372,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"The old lady did not seem as well as usual, and ""wished heartily,"" she"

3374,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3375,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"""Why, I shall be back,"" said he ""in six days, and can come sooner, if"
3376,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"any of you need me."""
3377,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3378,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"""You should not speak so positive about it,"" said aunt Eleanor, ""you"

3381,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"""Oh fye, auntie, you've got the blues this morning! I shall be back"

3392,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"cousin with one arm and his great dog with the other, he tripped"
3393,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"lightly over the threshold. ""There, auntie,"" he cried, ""I could carry"

3397,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,Though the old lady smiled at the moment the cloud came back again to

3399,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,misty eyes could distinguish him in the distance.
3400,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3401,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"As merry, as strong, and as full of life as ever, the young man went"
3402,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"to his work that morning. Arrived at the harvest field, he took off"
3403,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"his coat and went in among the laborers, saying that he thought he"
3404,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"could outwork them all that day, he felt so vigorous. The sun was"
3405,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"exceeding hot, the air sultry and close, and the laborers, in spite of"
3406,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"their determination and strength, grew very weary when the sun was"
3407,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"high in the heavens. About eleven o'clock, a boy came from the house"
3408,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"and brought them a jug of cold water. Josiah took it first, and drank"
3409,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"of it until they all called to him to stop. He did not heed them, but"
3410,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"being very thirsty, drank until he was satisfied; then stooped to set"
3411,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"the jug on the ground, and fell down beside it a corpse."
3412,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,
3413,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"Thus suddenly, in the prime of his young life, was he called into"

3416,THE UNCERTAINTY OF LIFE.,"I seem to hear you saying, little reader, ""This was very sudden; but"

3443,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,
3444,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"When I was a boy, and attended school, I was like a great many other"
3445,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"boys, more inclined to play and read story books than I was to study"
3446,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,my lessons; it was a rule at our school to carry a book home every
3447,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,night and study the lesson for the following day; but I would avoid
3448,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"this by some deception, and of course the next morning my recitation"
3449,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,would be very imperfect.
3450,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,
3451,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"One morning I awoke quite early, and I remembered that we were to have"
3452,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"a very difficult lesson on that morning, and I had neglected it that I"
3453,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,might join in a game of foot-ball. It was too late then to commit it
3454,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"to memory, and I felt ashamed to go to school without it, for I knew"
3455,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"that I should be punished, and be obliged to remain in at recess to"
3456,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"make up the lesson. I did not want to play truant, for I was fearful"
3457,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"of detection, so I went to my father and feigned headache, and plead"
3458,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"that I might remain at home that day. The wish was granted, and for a"
3459,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"moment I felt relieved, but at breakfast or dinner, I was not allowed"
3460,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"to eat anything; I was obliged to remain in doors all day, although"
3461,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"the sun was shining brightly out of doors, and with a conscience"
3462,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"restless and reproving me all the time, I passed a wretched day."
3463,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,
3464,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"My father, always kind and attentive to his children, would lay his"
3465,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"hand upon my head and pity me, so that my heart ached when I thought"
3466,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"how wickedly I was deceiving him. The day passed, and I went to my"
3467,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"bed, but I could not sleep. I had told my father a lie, and the"
3468,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"thought of it lay like a weight upon my heart. I slept a little, but"
3469,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"it was a troubled and unhappy sleep. When I arose in the morning, I"
3470,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"went to my father, and with tearful eyes confessed my deception. He"
3471,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"was surprised and grieved. I stood before him with my head hung down,"
3472,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,feeling thoroughly ashamed. I asked forgiveness of him and it was
3473,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,granted. I was then told to go to school and tell the teacher of my
3474,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"fault, and promise never to attempt such a wrong again."
3475,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,
3476,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"I have grown a man since then, but the memory of that error is still"
3477,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,fresh in my mind. It was the last time I ever attempted to deceive my
3478,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"father. I have no father or mother now, but the lesson which that day"
3479,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"I learned, will guard me through life from any attempt at deceiving"
3480,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,those to whom I am indebted for kindness and love. If any little boy
3481,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"should read this story, let him be mindful and avoid all temptations,"
3482,THE FIRST DECEPTION.,"which, if yielded to, will cause him in after years many bitter pangs"
