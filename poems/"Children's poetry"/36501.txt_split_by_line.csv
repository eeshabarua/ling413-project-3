62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,"An Olive Leaf was the first gift of the Earth after the Flood, to the"
64,PREFACE.,"sole survivors of a buried race. It was borne by the Dove, spreading a"
65,PREFACE.,"timid wing over the surging waters, so lately without a shore."
66,PREFACE.,
67,PREFACE.,"The plant thus honoured, as the love-token of a World, rising in"
68,PREFACE.,"freshness from the wrecks of the Deluge, has long been a consecrated"
69,PREFACE.,emblem of peace. It then brought the joyful tidings to the voyagers in
70,PREFACE.,"the lonely Ark, of a home once more upon the green earth; and has since"
71,PREFACE.,"cheered many a Christian heart, with the assurance that the bitter"
72,PREFACE.,waters of strife had abated.
73,PREFACE.,
74,PREFACE.,"These, my simple ""Olive Leaves,"" would fain be love-tokens to you, sweet"
75,PREFACE.,"young friends, who may chance to take them in your hand. Buds of the"
76,PREFACE.,"olive and of the rose, are ye: pour forth the spirit of peace and love,"
77,PREFACE.,"as ye unfold and ripen on the pilgrimage of life, that you may be"
78,PREFACE.,"gathered at its close, where their bloom is eternal."

201,OLIVE LEAVES.,"I have something to say to the young, about the advantage, as well as"
202,OLIVE LEAVES.,"duty of obeying their parents. My story will be of an interesting boy,"
203,OLIVE LEAVES.,"by the name of Charles Morton. He had a pleasant temper, and almost"
204,OLIVE LEAVES.,"always wore a smile. He ardently loved his sister Caroline, who was"
205,OLIVE LEAVES.,"several years younger than himself; and whenever he came from school,"
206,OLIVE LEAVES.,"would ask for her, and take her in his arms, or guide her tottering"
207,OLIVE LEAVES.,footsteps.
208,OLIVE LEAVES.,
209,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But Charles, with all his kindness of heart, had a sad fault. He would"
210,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sometimes disobey his parents, when he was out of their sight. He did"
211,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not remember that the Eye of God always saw him, both in darkness and in"
212,OLIVE LEAVES.,"light, and would take note of the sin that he committed, though his"
213,OLIVE LEAVES.,"parents knew it not. At a short distance from his home, was a beautiful"
214,OLIVE LEAVES.,"river, broad and deep. His parents had strictly charged him never to"
215,OLIVE LEAVES.,"venture in, and had explained to him the danger which a boy of eight"
216,OLIVE LEAVES.,"years old would incur, in a tide so strong. Notwithstanding this, he"
217,OLIVE LEAVES.,"would sometimes seek a spot where the banks, or the trees upon the"
218,OLIVE LEAVES.,"shore, concealed him, and take off his shoes, and step into the water."
219,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He grew fond of wading, and would occasionally stay in the water a long"
220,OLIVE LEAVES.,"time. Then, he greatly desired to swim. He frequently saw larger boys"
221,OLIVE LEAVES.,"amusing themselves in this way, and longed to join them. But he feared"
222,OLIVE LEAVES.,"lest they might mention it to his father, and determined to go alone."
223,OLIVE LEAVES.,
224,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Here was the sin of the little boy, not only in continuing to disobey,"
225,OLIVE LEAVES.,but in studying how to deceive his kind parents. One fine afternoon in
226,OLIVE LEAVES.,"summer, school was dismissed at an earlier hour than usual. Now, thought"
227,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Charles, I can make a trial at swimming, and get home, before my mother"
228,OLIVE LEAVES.,"misses me. He sought a retired spot, where he had never seen his"
229,OLIVE LEAVES.,"companions go, and hastened to throw off his clothes, and plunge into"
230,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the water. He did not imagine that it was so deep there, and that the"
231,OLIVE LEAVES.,"current was so exceedingly swift. He struggled with all his might, but"
232,OLIVE LEAVES.,was borne farther and farther from the shore. The sea was not a great
233,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distance from the mouth of the river, and the tide was driving on"
234,OLIVE LEAVES.,"violently, and what could he do? Nothing, but to exhaust his feeble"
235,OLIVE LEAVES.,"strength, and then give up, and be carried onwards. He became weary of"
236,OLIVE LEAVES.,"beating the water with his feet and hands to no purpose, and his throat"
237,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was dry with crying, and so he floated along, like a poor, uprooted"
238,OLIVE LEAVES.,"weed. It was fearful to him to be hurried away so, with the waters"
239,OLIVE LEAVES.,"roaring in his ears. He gave up all hope of seeing his dear home again,"
240,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and dreaded the thought of being drowned, and devoured by monstrous"
241,OLIVE LEAVES.,fishes. How he wished that he had not disobeyed his good parents; and he
242,OLIVE LEAVES.,"earnestly prayed God to forgive him, and have mercy upon his soul."
243,OLIVE LEAVES.,
244,OLIVE LEAVES.,"At Charles Morton's home, his mother had prepared a bowl of bread and"
245,OLIVE LEAVES.,"milk for him, because he usually was hungry when he came from school."
246,OLIVE LEAVES.,
247,OLIVE LEAVES.,"At length she began to look from the window, and to feel uneasy. Little"
248,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Caroline crept to the door, and continually called ""Tarle, Tarle!"" But"
249,OLIVE LEAVES.,"when the sun disappeared, and Mr. Morton returned, and nothing had been"
250,OLIVE LEAVES.,"seen of the dear boy, they were greatly alarmed. They searched the"
251,OLIVE LEAVES.,"places where he had been accustomed to play, and questioned his"
252,OLIVE LEAVES.,"companions, but in vain. The neighbours collected, and attended the"
253,OLIVE LEAVES.,"father in pursuit of his lost son. What was their distress, at finding"
254,OLIVE LEAVES.,"his clothes in a remote recess, near the river's brink! They immediately"
255,OLIVE LEAVES.,"gave him up as drowned, and commenced the search for his body. There was"
256,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bitter mourning in his once happy home, that night. Many weeks elapsed,"
257,OLIVE LEAVES.,"ere little Caroline ceased calling for her ""_dear Tarle_,"" or the sad"
258,OLIVE LEAVES.,"parents could be comforted. And it was remembered amid their affliction,"
259,OLIVE LEAVES.,that the beloved child whom they had endeavoured to teach the fear of
260,OLIVE LEAVES.,"God, had forgotten that All-seeing Eye, when he disobeyed his parents."
261,OLIVE LEAVES.,
262,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But while they were lamenting their lost son, he was not dead. While"
263,OLIVE LEAVES.,"faintly struggling on the river, he had been discovered, and taken up by"
264,OLIVE LEAVES.,an Indian canoe. He had been borne by the swift current far from the
265,OLIVE LEAVES.,place where he first went into the water. And it was very long after he
266,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was rescued, before he came to his senses, so as to give any connected"
267,OLIVE LEAVES.,"account of himself. Then, he was greatly shocked at finding himself in a"
268,OLIVE LEAVES.,"boat, with two huge Indians. He shrieked, and begged to be taken to his"
269,OLIVE LEAVES.,"father's house; but they paid no attention to his cries, and silently"
270,OLIVE LEAVES.,"proceeded on their voyage. They wrapped a blanket around him, because he"
271,OLIVE LEAVES.,"had no clothes, and offered him some parched corn, but he had no heart"
272,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to eat. By the rough tossing of the boat, he discovered that they were"
273,OLIVE LEAVES.,"upon the deep sea, and the broad moon rose high, and shone long, ere"
274,OLIVE LEAVES.,"they drew near to land. Stupefied with terror, one of the Indians"
275,OLIVE LEAVES.,"carried him in his arms to a rude hut, and gave him to his wife."
276,OLIVE LEAVES.,
277,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""What have you brought?"" said she, as she loosened the blanket, and"
278,OLIVE LEAVES.,discovered the dripping locks and shivering form of the affrighted
279,OLIVE LEAVES.,child.
280,OLIVE LEAVES.,
281,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""A white pappoose,"" answered the hoarse voice of the husband. Poor"
282,OLIVE LEAVES.,Charles looked up with a cry of horror and despair. The woman regarded
283,OLIVE LEAVES.,him earnestly for a moment.
284,OLIVE LEAVES.,
285,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""He is like my son that I buried,"" said she, and she folded her dark"
286,OLIVE LEAVES.,"arms around him, and wept. She kindled a fire to warm him, and pressed"
287,OLIVE LEAVES.,"food upon him, but he was sick at heart. She laid him in the rude bed of"
288,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her dead child, and he sobbed himself into a deep, long sleep. It was"
289,OLIVE LEAVES.,late in the morning when he opened his eyes. Who can describe his
290,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distress! No kind parent to speak to him, no little sister to twine her"
291,OLIVE LEAVES.,"arms around his neck. Nothing but a dark hovel, and strange Indian"
292,OLIVE LEAVES.,"faces. The woman, with her husband and father, were the sole inhabitants"
293,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of the hut, and of this lone, sea-girt island. A dreadful feeling of"
294,OLIVE LEAVES.,"desolation came over him, and he laid down his head, and mourned"
295,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bitterly. The red-browed woman pitied him, and adopted him into her"
296,OLIVE LEAVES.,"heart, in place of the child she had lost. She brought him the coarse"
297,OLIVE LEAVES.,"garments of her dead son, and he was obliged to put them on, for he had"
298,OLIVE LEAVES.,no other.
299,OLIVE LEAVES.,
300,OLIVE LEAVES.,"His heart sunk within him, when on going out of the door, he could see"
301,OLIVE LEAVES.,no roof save the one where he had lodged. Some little rocky islands were
302,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in sight, but none of them inhabited. He felt as if he was alone in the"
303,OLIVE LEAVES.,"world, and said, ""This is the punishment of my disobedience."""
304,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Continually he was begging with tears, to be taken to his home, and the"
305,OLIVE LEAVES.,"men promised ""when we go so far again in the boat, we will carry you."""
306,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But their manners were so stern, that he began to fear to urge them as"
307,OLIVE LEAVES.,"much as he wished. So every night, when he had retired to sleep, the"
308,OLIVE LEAVES.,"woman said to her husband, ""We will keep him. He will be contented. His"
309,OLIVE LEAVES.,"beautiful blue eye is not so wild and strained, as when you brought him."
310,OLIVE LEAVES.,"My heart yearns towards him, as it did over the one that shall wake no"
311,OLIVE LEAVES.,"more."""
312,OLIVE LEAVES.,
313,OLIVE LEAVES.,"She took him with her to gather the rushes, with which she platted mats"
314,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and baskets, and showed him where the solitary bittern made her nest,"
315,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and how to trace the swift steps of the heron, as with whirring wing"
316,OLIVE LEAVES.,half spread it hasted through the marshes to the sea. And she taught him
317,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to dig roots, which contain the spirit of health, and to know the herbs"
318,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that bring sleep to the sick, and staunch the flowing blood: for she"
319,OLIVE LEAVES.,"trusted that in industry, and the simple knowledge of nature, he would"
320,OLIVE LEAVES.,"find content. At first, she brought him wild flowers, but she perceived"
321,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that they always made him weep, for he had been accustomed to gather"
322,OLIVE LEAVES.,"them for his little Caroline. So she passed them by, blooming in their"
323,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wild recesses, and instructed him how to climb the trees where the"
324,OLIVE LEAVES.,grape-vine hung its airy clusters. And she gave him a choice bow and
325,OLIVE LEAVES.,"arrow, ornamented with brilliant feathers, and encouraged him to take"
326,OLIVE LEAVES.,aim at the birds that sang among the low branches. But he shrank back at
327,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the thought of hurting the warbler, and she said silently,"
328,OLIVE LEAVES.,
329,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Surely, the babe of the white woman is not in spirit like his red"
330,OLIVE LEAVES.,brother. He who sleeps in the grave was happy when he bent the bow and
331,OLIVE LEAVES.,"followed his father to the chase."""
332,OLIVE LEAVES.,
333,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Little Charles spent a part of each day in watching the sails, as they"
334,OLIVE LEAVES.,"glided along on the broad sea. For a long time, he would stand as near"
335,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the shore as possible, and make signs, and shout, hoping they might be"
336,OLIVE LEAVES.,"induced to come and take him to his home. But an object so diminutive,"
337,OLIVE LEAVES.,"attracted no attention, and the small island, with its neighbouring"
338,OLIVE LEAVES.,"group of rocks, looked so desolate, and the channel so obstructed and"
339,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dangerous, that vessels had no motive to approach it."
340,OLIVE LEAVES.,
341,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When the chill of early autumn was in the air, the Indian woman invited"
342,OLIVE LEAVES.,"him to assist her in gathering the golden ears of the maize, and in"
343,OLIVE LEAVES.,"separating them from their investing sheath. But he worked sorrowfully,"
344,OLIVE LEAVES.,for he was ever thinking of his own dear home. Once the men permitted
345,OLIVE LEAVES.,"him to accompany them, when they went on a short fishing excursion; but"
346,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he wept and implored so violently to be taken to his parents, that they"
347,OLIVE LEAVES.,"frowned, and forbade him to go any more in the boat. They told him, that"
348,OLIVE LEAVES.,"twice or thrice in the year they performed a long voyage, and went up"
349,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the river, to dispose of the articles of their manufacture and purchase"
350,OLIVE LEAVES.,"some necessary stores. They should go when spring returned, and would"
351,OLIVE LEAVES.,then carry him to his parents. So the poor little boy perceived that he
352,OLIVE LEAVES.,"must try to be patient and quiet, through the long, dreary winter, in an"
353,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Indian hut. The red-browed woman ever looked smilingly upon him, and"
354,OLIVE LEAVES.,"spoke to him with a sweet, fond tone. She wished him to call her mother,"
355,OLIVE LEAVES.,and was always trying to promote his comfort. After Charles had obtained
356,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the promise of her husband and father, to take him home in the spring,"
357,OLIVE LEAVES.,his mind was more at rest. He worked diligently as his strength and
358,OLIVE LEAVES.,"skill would permit, on the baskets, mats, and brooms, with which the"
359,OLIVE LEAVES.,boat was to be freighted. He took pleasure in painting with the bright
360,OLIVE LEAVES.,"colours which they obtained from plants, two baskets, which were"
361,OLIVE LEAVES.,intended as presents for his mother and Caroline.
362,OLIVE LEAVES.,
363,OLIVE LEAVES.,The Indian woman often entertained him with stories of her ancestors.
364,OLIVE LEAVES.,"She spoke of their dexterity in the chase, of their valour in battle."
365,OLIVE LEAVES.,"She described their war-dances, and the feathery lightness of their"
366,OLIVE LEAVES.,"canoes upon the wave. She told of the gravity of their chiefs, the"
367,OLIVE LEAVES.,"eloquence of their orators, the respect of the young men for those of"
368,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hoary hairs. She related instances of the firmness of their friendship,"
369,OLIVE LEAVES.,and the terror of their revenge.
370,OLIVE LEAVES.,
371,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Once the whole land was theirs, said she, and no white man dwelt in it,"
372,OLIVE LEAVES.,"or had discovered it. Now, our race are few and feeble, they are driven"
373,OLIVE LEAVES.,"away and perish. They leave their fathers' graves, and hide among the"
374,OLIVE LEAVES.,"forests. The forests fall before the axe of the white man, and they are"
375,OLIVE LEAVES.,"again driven out, we know not where. No voice asks after them. They fade"
376,OLIVE LEAVES.,"away like a mist, and are forgotten."""
377,OLIVE LEAVES.,
378,OLIVE LEAVES.,The little boy wept at the plaintive tone in which she spoke of the
379,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sorrows of her people, and said, ""_I_ will pity and love the Indians, as"
380,OLIVE LEAVES.,"long as I live."" Sometimes, during the long storms of winter, he would"
381,OLIVE LEAVES.,"tell them of the Bible, in which he had loved to read, and would repeat"
382,OLIVE LEAVES.,the hymns and chapters which he had learned at the Sabbath school. And
383,OLIVE LEAVES.,then he regretted that he had not exerted himself to learn more when it
384,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was in his power, and that he had ever grieved his teachers. He found"
385,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that these Indians were not able to read, and said, ""Oh that I had now"
386,OLIVE LEAVES.,"but _one_ of those books, which I used to prize so little when I was at"
387,OLIVE LEAVES.,"home, and had so many."" They listened attentively to all that he said."
388,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Sometimes he told them what he had learned of God, and added,"
389,OLIVE LEAVES.,
390,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""He is a good God, and a God of truth, but I displeased him when I was"
391,OLIVE LEAVES.,"disobedient to my parents."""
392,OLIVE LEAVES.,
393,OLIVE LEAVES.,"At length, Spring appeared. The heart of little Charles leaped for joy,"
394,OLIVE LEAVES.,when he heard the sweet song of the earliest bird. Every morning he rose
395,OLIVE LEAVES.,"early, and went forth to see if the grass had not become greener during"
396,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the night. Every hour, he desired to remind them of the long-treasured"
397,OLIVE LEAVES.,"promise. But he saw that the men looked grave if he was impatient, and"
398,OLIVE LEAVES.,the brow of his Indian mother became each day more sad.
399,OLIVE LEAVES.,
400,OLIVE LEAVES.,The appointed period arrived. The boat was laden with the products of
401,OLIVE LEAVES.,their industry. All was ready for departure. Charles wept when he was
402,OLIVE LEAVES.,about to take leave of his kind Indian nurse.
403,OLIVE LEAVES.,
404,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I will go also,"" said she; and they made room for her in the boat. The"
405,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bright sun was rising gloriously in the east, as they left the desolate"
406,OLIVE LEAVES.,"island. Through the whole voyage she held the boy near her, or in her"
407,OLIVE LEAVES.,"arms, but spoke not. Birds were winging their way over the blue sea,"
408,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and, after they entered the river, poured forth the clearest melodies"
409,OLIVE LEAVES.,"from shore and tree, but still she spoke not. There seemed a sorrow at"
410,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her breast, which made her lip tremble, yet her eye was tearless."
411,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Charles refrained to utter the joy which swelled in his bosom, for he"
412,OLIVE LEAVES.,"saw she was unhappy. He put his arm round her neck, and leaned his head"
413,OLIVE LEAVES.,"on her shoulder. As evening approached, they drew near the spot, where"
414,OLIVE LEAVES.,"she understood she must part from him. Then Charles said eagerly to her,"
415,OLIVE LEAVES.,
416,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Oh, go home with me to my father's house. Yes, yes, come all of you"
417,OLIVE LEAVES.,"with me, my dear, good people, that all of us may thank you together for"
418,OLIVE LEAVES.,"having saved my life."""
419,OLIVE LEAVES.,
420,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""No,"" she answered sorrowfully: ""I could not bear to see thy mother fold"
421,OLIVE LEAVES.,"thee in her arms, and to know that thou wert mine no more. Since thou"
422,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hast told me of thy God, and that he listened to prayer, my prayer has"
423,OLIVE LEAVES.,"been lifted up to Him night and day, that thy heart might find rest in"
424,OLIVE LEAVES.,"an Indian home. But this is over. Henceforth, my path and my soul are"
425,OLIVE LEAVES.,"desolate. Yet go thy way, to thy mother, that she may have joy when she"
426,OLIVE LEAVES.,"rises up in the morning, and at night goes to rest."""
427,OLIVE LEAVES.,
428,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Her tears fell down like rain, as she embraced him, and they lifted him"
429,OLIVE LEAVES.,"upon the bank. And eager as he was to meet his parents, and his beloved"
430,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sister, he lingered to watch the boat as it glided away. He saw that she"
431,OLIVE LEAVES.,"raised not her head, nor uncovered her face. He remembered her long and"
432,OLIVE LEAVES.,"true kindness, and asked God to bless and reward her, as he hastened"
433,OLIVE LEAVES.,over the well known space that divided him from his native village.
434,OLIVE LEAVES.,
435,OLIVE LEAVES.,"His heart beat so thick as almost to suffocate him, when he saw his"
436,OLIVE LEAVES.,"father's roof. It was twilight, and the trees where he used to gather"
437,OLIVE LEAVES.,"apples, were in full and fragrant bloom. Half breathless, he rushed in"
438,OLIVE LEAVES.,"at the door. His father was reading in the parlour, and rose coldly to"
439,OLIVE LEAVES.,"meet him. So changed was his person, and dress, that he did not know his"
440,OLIVE LEAVES.,"son. But the mother shrieked. She knew the blue eye, that no misery of"
441,OLIVE LEAVES.,"garb could change. She sprang to embrace him, and fainted. It was a keen"
442,OLIVE LEAVES.,"anguish to him, that his mother thus should suffer. Little Caroline"
443,OLIVE LEAVES.,"clung around his neck, and as he kissed her, he whispered ""Remember, God"
444,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sees, and punishes the disobedient."" His pale mother lifted up her head,"
445,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and drew him from his father's arms, upon the bed, beside her. ""Father,"
446,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Mother,"" said the delighted boy, ""forgive me."" They both assured him of"
447,OLIVE LEAVES.,"their love, and his father looking upward said, ""My God, I thank thee!"
448,OLIVE LEAVES.,"for this my son was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is"
449,OLIVE LEAVES.,"found."""

497,OLIVE LEAVES.,
498,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Mrs. Ludlow told her to go to the kitchen, and see that the bread was"

501,OLIVE LEAVES.,
502,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Frank and Edward Ludlow were fine boys, of eleven and nine years old."

514,OLIVE LEAVES.,pond a few times more. We left all the boys there when we came away. The
515,OLIVE LEAVES.,"next time, we will try to be as true as the town-clock. And it is not"

519,OLIVE LEAVES.,"appoint. I know that you do not intend to disobey, or to give me"
520,OLIVE LEAVES.,"anxiety. But you must take pains to be punctual. When you become men, it"
521,OLIVE LEAVES.,will be of great importance that you observe your engagements. Unless
522,OLIVE LEAVES.,"you perform what is expected of you, at the proper time, people will"

534,OLIVE LEAVES.,"looked up in their faces, with a sweet smile."
535,OLIVE LEAVES.,
536,OLIVE LEAVES.,The evening meal was a pleasant one. The mother and her children talked
537,OLIVE LEAVES.,cheerfully together. Each had some little agreeable circumstance to

539,OLIVE LEAVES.,
540,OLIVE LEAVES.,"After supper, books and maps were laid on the table, and Mrs. Ludlow"

547,OLIVE LEAVES.,
548,OLIVE LEAVES.,"So Frank overlooked her geography, and asked her a few questions on the"
549,OLIVE LEAVES.,"map; and Edward explained to her a little arithmetic, and told a story"
550,OLIVE LEAVES.,"from the history of England, with which she was much pleased. Soon she"
551,OLIVE LEAVES.,"grew sleepy, and kissing her brothers, wished them an affectionate"
552,OLIVE LEAVES.,"good-night. Her mother went with her, to see her laid comfortably in"
553,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bed, and to hear her repeat her evening hymns, and thank her Father in"

555,OLIVE LEAVES.,
556,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When Mrs. Ludlow returned to the parlour, she found her sons busily"

559,OLIVE LEAVES.,"their books, they saw that their diligence was rewarded by her approving"
560,OLIVE LEAVES.,eye.
561,OLIVE LEAVES.,
562,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When they had completed their studies, they replaced the books which"
563,OLIVE LEAVES.,"they had used, in the bookcase, and drew their chairs nearer to the"
564,OLIVE LEAVES.,"fire. The kind mother joined them, with a basket of fruit, and while"
565,OLIVE LEAVES.,"they partook of it, they had the following conversation."
566,OLIVE LEAVES.,
567,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""I should like to hear, my dear boys, more of what you"
568,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have learned to-day."""
569,OLIVE LEAVES.,
570,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Frank._ ""I have been much pleased with a book that I borrowed of one of"
571,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the boys. Indeed, I have hardly thought of any thing else. I must"
572,OLIVE LEAVES.,"confess that I put it inside of my geography, and read it while the"
573,OLIVE LEAVES.,"master thought I was studying."""
574,OLIVE LEAVES.,
575,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""I am truly sorry, Frank, that you should be willing to"
576,OLIVE LEAVES.,"deceive. What are called _boy's tricks_, too often lead to falsehood,"
577,OLIVE LEAVES.,and end in disgrace. On this occasion you cheated yourself also. You
578,OLIVE LEAVES.,"lost the knowledge which you might have gained, for the sake of what, I"
579,OLIVE LEAVES.,"suppose, was only some book of amusement."""
580,OLIVE LEAVES.,
581,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Frank._ ""Mother, it was the life of Charles the XII. of Sweden. You"
582,OLIVE LEAVES.,know that he was the bravest soldier of his times. He beat the king of
583,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Denmark, when he was only eighteen years old. Then he defeated the"
584,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Russians, at the battle of Narva, though they had 80,000 soldiers, and"
585,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he had not a quarter of that number."""
586,OLIVE LEAVES.,
587,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""How did he die?"""
588,OLIVE LEAVES.,
589,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Frank._ ""He went to make war in Norway. It was a terribly severe"
590,OLIVE LEAVES.,"winter, but he feared no hardship. The cold was so great, that his"
591,OLIVE LEAVES.,sentinels were often found frozen to death at their posts. He was
592,OLIVE LEAVES.,besieging a town called Frederickshall. It was about the middle of
593,OLIVE LEAVES.,December. He gave orders that they should continue to work on the
594,OLIVE LEAVES.,"trenches, though the feet of the soldiers were benumbed, and their hands"
595,OLIVE LEAVES.,"froze to the tools. He got up very early one morning, to see if they"
596,OLIVE LEAVES.,were at their work. The stars shone clear and bright on the snow that
597,OLIVE LEAVES.,covered every thing. Sometimes a firing was heard from the enemy. But he
598,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was too courageous to mind that. Suddenly, a cannon-shot struck him, and"
599,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he fell. When they took him up, his forehead was beat in, but his right"
600,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hand still strongly grasped the sword. Mother, was not that dying like a"
601,OLIVE LEAVES.,"brave man?"""
602,OLIVE LEAVES.,
603,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""I should think there was more of rashness than bravery"
604,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in thus exposing himself, for no better reason. Do you not feel that it"
605,OLIVE LEAVES.,was cruel to force his soldiers to such labours in that dreadful
606,OLIVE LEAVES.,"climate, and to make war when it was not necessary? The historians say"
607,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that he undertook it, only to fill up an interval of time, until he"
608,OLIVE LEAVES.,"could be prepared for his great campaign in Poland. So, to amuse his"
609,OLIVE LEAVES.,"restless mind, he was willing to destroy his own soldiers, willing to"
610,OLIVE LEAVES.,see even his most faithful friends frozen every morning into statues.
611,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Edward, tell me what you remember."""
612,OLIVE LEAVES.,
613,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Edward._ ""My lesson in the history of Rome, was the character of"
614,OLIVE LEAVES.,Antoninus Pius. He was one of the best of the Roman Emperors. While he
615,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was young, he paid great respect to the aged, and when he grew rich he"
616,OLIVE LEAVES.,gave liberally to the poor. He greatly disliked war. He said he had
617,OLIVE LEAVES.,"'rather save the life of one subject, than destroy a thousand enemies.'"
618,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Rome was prosperous and happy, under his government. He reigned 22"
619,OLIVE LEAVES.,"years, and died, with many friends surrounding his bed, at the age of"
620,OLIVE LEAVES.,"74."""
621,OLIVE LEAVES.,
622,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""Was he not beloved by the people whom he ruled? I have"
623,OLIVE LEAVES.,"read that they all mourned at his death, as if they had lost a father."
624,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Was it not better to be thus lamented, than to be remembered only by the"
625,OLIVE LEAVES.,"numbers he had slain, and the miseries he had caused?"""
626,OLIVE LEAVES.,
627,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Frank._ ""But mother, the glory of Charles the XII. of Sweden, was"
628,OLIVE LEAVES.,"certainly greater than that of a quiet old man, who, I dare say, was"
629,OLIVE LEAVES.,"afraid to fight. Antoninus Pius was clever enough, but you cannot deny"
630,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that Alexander, and CÃ¦sar, and Bonaparte, had far greater talents. They"
631,OLIVE LEAVES.,"will be called heroes and praised, as long as the world stands."""
632,OLIVE LEAVES.,
633,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_Mrs. Ludlow._ ""My dear children, those talents should be most admired,"
634,OLIVE LEAVES.,"which produce the greatest good. That fame is the highest, which best"
635,OLIVE LEAVES.,agrees with our duty to God and man. Do not be dazzled by the false
636,OLIVE LEAVES.,"glory that surrounds the hero. Consider it your glory to live in peace,"
637,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and to make others happy. Believe me, when you come to your death-beds,"
638,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and oh, how soon will that be, for the longest life is short, it will"
639,OLIVE LEAVES.,"give you more comfort to reflect that you have healed one broken heart,"
640,OLIVE LEAVES.,"given one poor child the means of education, or sent to one heathen the"
641,OLIVE LEAVES.,"book of salvation, than that you lifted your hand to destroy your"
642,OLIVE LEAVES.,"fellow-creatures, and wrung forth the tears of widows and of orphans."""
643,OLIVE LEAVES.,
644,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The hour of rest had come, and the mother opened the large family Bible,"
645,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that they might together remember and thank Him, who had preserved them"
646,OLIVE LEAVES.,"through the day. When Frank and Edward took leave of her for the night,"
647,OLIVE LEAVES.,they were grieved to see that there were tears in her eyes. They
648,OLIVE LEAVES.,"lingered by her side, hoping she would tell them if any thing had"
649,OLIVE LEAVES.,"troubled her. But she only said, ""My sons, my dear sons, before you"
650,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sleep, pray to God for a heart to love peace."""
651,OLIVE LEAVES.,
652,OLIVE LEAVES.,"After they had retired, Frank said to his brother,"
653,OLIVE LEAVES.,
654,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I cannot feel that it is wrong to be a soldier. Was not our father one?"
655,OLIVE LEAVES.,"I shall never forget the fine stories he used to tell me about battles,"
656,OLIVE LEAVES.,when I was almost a baby. I remember that I used to climb up on his
657,OLIVE LEAVES.,"knee, and put my face close to his. Then I used to dream of prancing"
658,OLIVE LEAVES.,"horses, and glittering swords, and sounding trumpets, and wake up and"
659,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wish I was a soldier. Indeed, Edward, I wish so now. But I cannot tell"
660,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dear mother what is in my heart, for it would grieve her."""
661,OLIVE LEAVES.,
662,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""No, no, don't tell her so, dear Frank, and pray, never be a soldier. I"
663,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have heard her say, that father's ill health, and most of his troubles,"
664,OLIVE LEAVES.,"came from the life that he led in camps. He said on his death-bed, that"
665,OLIVE LEAVES.,"if he could live his youth over again, he would be a meek follower of"
666,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the Saviour, and not a man of blood."""
667,OLIVE LEAVES.,
668,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Edward, our father was engaged in the war of the Revolution, without"
669,OLIVE LEAVES.,which we should all have been slaves. Do you pretend to say that it was
670,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not a holy war?"""
671,OLIVE LEAVES.,
672,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I pretend to say nothing, brother, only what the Bible says, Render to"
673,OLIVE LEAVES.,"no man evil for evil, but follow after the things that make for peace."""
674,OLIVE LEAVES.,
675,OLIVE LEAVES.,The boys had frequent conversations on the subject of war and peace.
676,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Their opinions still continued to differ. Their love for their mother,"
677,OLIVE LEAVES.,prevented their holding these discourses often in her presence; for they
678,OLIVE LEAVES.,perceived that Frank's admiration of martial renown gave her increased
679,OLIVE LEAVES.,pain. She devoted her life to the education and happiness of her
680,OLIVE LEAVES.,"children. She secured for them every opportunity in her power, for the"
681,OLIVE LEAVES.,"acquisition of useful knowledge, and both by precept and example urged"
682,OLIVE LEAVES.,"them to add to their ""knowledge, temperance, and to temperance,"
683,OLIVE LEAVES.,"brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity."""
684,OLIVE LEAVES.,
685,OLIVE LEAVES.,This little family were models of kindness and affection among
686,OLIVE LEAVES.,themselves. Each strove to make the others happy. Their fire-side was
687,OLIVE LEAVES.,"always cheerful, and the summer evening walks which the mother took with"
688,OLIVE LEAVES.,her children were sources both of delight and improvement.
689,OLIVE LEAVES.,
690,OLIVE LEAVES.,Thus years passed away. The young saplings which they had cherished grew
691,OLIVE LEAVES.,"up to be trees, and the boys became men. The health of the kind and"
692,OLIVE LEAVES.,"faithful mother became feeble. At length, she visibly declined. But she"
693,OLIVE LEAVES.,wore on her brow the same sweet smile which had cheered their childhood.
694,OLIVE LEAVES.,
695,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Eliza watched over her, night and day, with the tenderest care. She was"
696,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not willing that any other hand should give the medicine, or smooth the"
697,OLIVE LEAVES.,pillow of the sufferer. She remembered the love that had nurtured her
698,OLIVE LEAVES.,"own childhood, and wished to perform every office that grateful"
699,OLIVE LEAVES.,affection could dictate.
700,OLIVE LEAVES.,
701,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Edward had completed his collegiate course, and was studying at a"
702,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distant seminary, to prepare himself for the ministry. He had sustained"
703,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a high character as a scholar, and had early chosen his place among the"
704,OLIVE LEAVES.,"followers of the Redeemer. As often as was in his power, he visited his"
705,OLIVE LEAVES.,"beloved parent, during her long sickness, and his letters full of fond"
706,OLIVE LEAVES.,"regard, and pious confidence, continually cheered her."
707,OLIVE LEAVES.,
708,OLIVE LEAVES.,Frank resided at home. He had chosen to pursue the business of
709,OLIVE LEAVES.,"agriculture, and superintended their small family estate. He had an"
710,OLIVE LEAVES.,"affectionate heart, and his attentions to his declining mother, were"
711,OLIVE LEAVES.,unceasing. In her last moments he stood by her side. His spirit was
712,OLIVE LEAVES.,"deeply smitten, as he supported his weeping sister, at the bed of the"
713,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dying. Pain had departed, and the meek Christian patiently awaited the"
714,OLIVE LEAVES.,"coming of her Lord. She had given much council to her children, and sent"
715,OLIVE LEAVES.,tender messages to the absent one. She seemed to have done speaking. But
716,OLIVE LEAVES.,"while they were uncertain whether she yet breathed, she raised her eyes"
717,OLIVE LEAVES.,"once more to her first-born, and said faintly, ""My son, follow peace"
718,OLIVE LEAVES.,"with all men."""
719,OLIVE LEAVES.,
720,OLIVE LEAVES.,"These were her last words. They listened attentively, but her voice was"
721,OLIVE LEAVES.,heard no more.
722,OLIVE LEAVES.,
723,OLIVE LEAVES.,Edward Ludlow was summoned to the funeral of his beloved mother. After
724,OLIVE LEAVES.,"she was committed to the dust, he remained a few days to mingle his"
725,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sympathies with his brother and sister. He knew how to comfort them, out"
726,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of the Scriptures, for therein was his hope, in all time of his"
727,OLIVE LEAVES.,tribulation.
728,OLIVE LEAVES.,
729,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Frank listened to all his admonitions, with a serious countenance, and a"
730,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sorrowful heart. He loved his brother with great ardour, and to the"
731,OLIVE LEAVES.,"mother for whom they mourned, he had always been dutiful. Yet she had"
732,OLIVE LEAVES.,"felt painfully anxious for him to the last, because he had not made"
733,OLIVE LEAVES.,"choice of religion for his guide, and secretly coveted the glory of the"
734,OLIVE LEAVES.,warrior.
735,OLIVE LEAVES.,
736,OLIVE LEAVES.,"After he became the head of the household, he continued to take the"
737,OLIVE LEAVES.,"kindest care of his sister, who prudently managed all his affairs, until"
738,OLIVE LEAVES.,his marriage. The companion whom he chose was a most amiable young
739,OLIVE LEAVES.,"woman, whose society and friendship greatly cheered the heart of Eliza."
740,OLIVE LEAVES.,There seemed to be not a shadow over the happiness of that small and
741,OLIVE LEAVES.,loving family.
742,OLIVE LEAVES.,
743,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But in little more than a year after Frank's marriage, the second war"
744,OLIVE LEAVES.,between this country and Great Britain commenced. Eliza trembled as she
745,OLIVE LEAVES.,"saw him possessing himself of all its details, and neglecting his"
746,OLIVE LEAVES.,business to gather and relate every rumour of war. Still she relied on
747,OLIVE LEAVES.,"his affection for his wife, to retain him at home. She could not"
748,OLIVE LEAVES.,understand the depth and force of the passion that prompted him to be a
749,OLIVE LEAVES.,soldier.
750,OLIVE LEAVES.,
751,OLIVE LEAVES.,At length he rashly enlisted. It was a sad night for that affectionate
752,OLIVE LEAVES.,"family, when he informed them that he must leave them and join the army."
753,OLIVE LEAVES.,"His young wife felt it the more deeply, because she had but recently"
754,OLIVE LEAVES.,buried a new-born babe. He comforted her as well as he could. He assured
755,OLIVE LEAVES.,her that his regiment would not probably be stationed at any great
756,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distance, that he would come home as often as possible, and that she"
757,OLIVE LEAVES.,should constantly receive letters from him. He told her that she could
758,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not imagine how restless and miserable he had been in his mind, ever"
759,OLIVE LEAVES.,"since war was declared. He could not bear to have his country insulted,"
760,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and take no part in her defence. Now, he said, he should again feel a"
761,OLIVE LEAVES.,"quiet conscience, because he had done his duty, that the war would"
762,OLIVE LEAVES.,"undoubtedly soon be terminated, and then he should return home, and they"
763,OLIVE LEAVES.,would all be happy together. He hinted at the promotion which courage
764,OLIVE LEAVES.,"might win, but such ambition had no part in his wife's gentler nature."
765,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He begged her not to distress him by her lamentations, but to let him"
766,OLIVE LEAVES.,"go away with a strong heart, like a hero."
767,OLIVE LEAVES.,
768,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When his wife and sister found that there was no alternative, they"
769,OLIVE LEAVES.,"endeavoured to comply with his request, and to part with him as calmly"
770,OLIVE LEAVES.,as possible. So Frank Ludlow went to be a soldier. He was twenty-five
771,OLIVE LEAVES.,"years old, a tall, handsome, and healthful young man. At the regimental"
772,OLIVE LEAVES.,"trainings in his native town, he had often been told how well he looked"
773,OLIVE LEAVES.,in a military dress. This had flattered his vanity. He loved martial
774,OLIVE LEAVES.,"music, and thought he should never be tired of serving his country."
775,OLIVE LEAVES.,
776,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But a life in camps has many evils, of which those who dwell at home are"
777,OLIVE LEAVES.,"entirely ignorant. Frank Ludlow scorned to complain of hardships, and"
778,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bore fatigue and privation, as well as the best. He was undoubtedly a"
779,OLIVE LEAVES.,"brave man, and never seemed in higher spirits, than when preparing for"
780,OLIVE LEAVES.,battle.
781,OLIVE LEAVES.,
782,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When a few months had past, the novelty of his situation wore off. There"
783,OLIVE LEAVES.,"were many times in which he thought of his quiet home, and his dear wife"
784,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and sister, until his heart was heavy in his bosom. He longed to see"
785,OLIVE LEAVES.,"them, but leave of absence could not be obtained. He felt so unhappy,"
786,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that he thought he could not endure it, and, always moved more by"
787,OLIVE LEAVES.,"impulse than principle, absconded to visit them."
788,OLIVE LEAVES.,
789,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When he returned to the regiment, it was to be disgraced for"
790,OLIVE LEAVES.,"disobedience. Thus humbled before his comrades, he felt indignant and"
791,OLIVE LEAVES.,"disgusted. He knew it was according to the rules of war, but he hoped"
792,OLIVE LEAVES.,that _he_ might have been excused.
793,OLIVE LEAVES.,
794,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Some time after, a letter from home informed him of the birth of an"
795,OLIVE LEAVES.,"infant. His feelings as a father were strong, and he yearned to see it."
796,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He attempted to obtain a furlough, but in vain. He was determined to"
797,OLIVE LEAVES.,"go, and so departed without leave. On the second day of his journey,"
798,OLIVE LEAVES.,"when at no great distance from the house, he was taken, and brought back"
799,OLIVE LEAVES.,as a deserter.
800,OLIVE LEAVES.,
801,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The punishment that followed, made him loathe war, in all its forms. He"
802,OLIVE LEAVES.,"had seen it at a distance, in its garb of glory, and worshipped the"
803,OLIVE LEAVES.,splendour that encircles the hero. But he had not taken into view the
804,OLIVE LEAVES.,"miseries of the private soldier, nor believed that the cup of glory was"
805,OLIVE LEAVES.,"for others, and the dregs of bitterness for him. The patriotism of which"
806,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he had boasted, vanished like a shadow, in the hour of trial; for"
807,OLIVE LEAVES.,"ambition, and not principle, had induced him to become a soldier."
808,OLIVE LEAVES.,
809,OLIVE LEAVES.,His state of mind rendered him an object of compassion. The strains of
810,OLIVE LEAVES.,"martial music, which he once admired, were discordant to his ear. His"
811,OLIVE LEAVES.,"daily duties became irksome to him. He shunned conversation, and thought"
812,OLIVE LEAVES.,"continually of his sweet, forsaken home, of the admonitions of his"
813,OLIVE LEAVES.,"departed mother, and the disappointment of all his gilded hopes."
814,OLIVE LEAVES.,
815,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The regiment to which he was attached, was ordered to a distant part of"
816,OLIVE LEAVES.,the country. It was an additional affliction to be so widely separated
817,OLIVE LEAVES.,from the objects of his love. In utter desperation he again deserted.
818,OLIVE LEAVES.,
819,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He was greatly fatigued, when he came in sight of his home. Its green"
820,OLIVE LEAVES.,"trees, and the fair fields which he so oft had tilled, smiled as an Eden"
821,OLIVE LEAVES.,"upon him. But he entered, as a lost spirit. His wife and sister wept"
822,OLIVE LEAVES.,"with joy, as they embraced him, and put his infant son into his arms."
823,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Its smiles and caresses woke him to agony, for he knew he must soon take"
824,OLIVE LEAVES.,"his leave of it, perhaps for ever."
825,OLIVE LEAVES.,
826,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He mentioned that his furlough would expire in a few days, and that he"
827,OLIVE LEAVES.,"had some hopes when winter came of obtaining a substitute, and then they"
828,OLIVE LEAVES.,"would be parted no more. He strove to appear cheerful, but his wife and"
829,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sister saw that there was a weight upon his spirit, and a cloud on his"
830,OLIVE LEAVES.,"brow, which they had never perceived before. He started at every sudden"
831,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sound, for he feared that he should be sought for in his own house, and"
832,OLIVE LEAVES.,taken back to the army.
833,OLIVE LEAVES.,
834,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When he dared no longer remain, he tore himself away, but not, as his"
835,OLIVE LEAVES.,"family supposed, to return to his duty. Disguising himself, he travelled"
836,OLIVE LEAVES.,"rapidly in a different direction, resolving to conceal himself in the"
837,OLIVE LEAVES.,"far west, or if necessary, to fly his country, rather than rejoin the"
838,OLIVE LEAVES.,army.
839,OLIVE LEAVES.,
840,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But in spite of every precaution, he was recognized by a party of"
841,OLIVE LEAVES.,"soldiers, who carried him back to his regiment, having been three times"
842,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a deserter. He was bound, and taken to the guard-house, where a"
843,OLIVE LEAVES.,"court-martial convened, to try his offence."
844,OLIVE LEAVES.,
845,OLIVE LEAVES.,It was now the summer of 1814. The morning sun shone forth brightly upon
846,OLIVE LEAVES.,"rock, and hill, and stream. But the quiet beauty of the rural landscape"
847,OLIVE LEAVES.,was vexed by the bustle and glare of a military encampment. Tent and
848,OLIVE LEAVES.,"barrack rose up among the verdure, and the shrill, spirit-stirring bugle"
849,OLIVE LEAVES.,echoed through the deep valley.
850,OLIVE LEAVES.,
851,OLIVE LEAVES.,"On the day of which we speak, the music seemed strangely subdued and"
852,OLIVE LEAVES.,"solemn. Muffled drums, and wind instruments mournfully playing,"
853,OLIVE LEAVES.,announced the slow march of a procession. A pinioned prisoner came forth
854,OLIVE LEAVES.,from his confinement. A coffin of rough boards was borne before him. By
855,OLIVE LEAVES.,"his side walked the chaplain, who had laboured to prepare his soul for"
856,OLIVE LEAVES.,"its extremity, and went with him as a pitying and sustaining spirit, to"
857,OLIVE LEAVES.,the last verge of life.
858,OLIVE LEAVES.,
859,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The sentenced man wore a long white mantle, like a winding-sheet. On his"
860,OLIVE LEAVES.,"head was a cap of the same colour, bordered with black. Behind him,"
861,OLIVE LEAVES.,"several prisoners walked, two and two. They had been confined for"
862,OLIVE LEAVES.,"various offences, and a part of their punishment was to stand by, and"
863,OLIVE LEAVES.,"witness the fate of their comrade. A strong guard of soldiers, marched"
864,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in order, with loaded muskets, and fixed bayonets."
865,OLIVE LEAVES.,
866,OLIVE LEAVES.,Such was the sad spectacle on that cloudless morning: a man in full
867,OLIVE LEAVES.,"strength and beauty, clad in burial garments, and walking onward to his"
868,OLIVE LEAVES.,grave. The procession halted at a broad open field. A mound of earth
869,OLIVE LEAVES.,"freshly thrown up in its centre, marked the yawning and untimely grave."
870,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Beyond it, many hundred men, drawn up in the form of a hollow square,"
871,OLIVE LEAVES.,stood in solemn silence.
872,OLIVE LEAVES.,
873,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The voice of the officer of the day, now and then heard, giving brief"
874,OLIVE LEAVES.,"orders, or marshalling the soldiers, was low, and varied by feeling. In"
875,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the line, but not yet called forth, were eight men, drawn by lot as"
876,OLIVE LEAVES.,"executioners. They stood motionless, revolting from their office, but"
877,OLIVE LEAVES.,not daring to disobey.
878,OLIVE LEAVES.,
879,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Between the coffin and the pit, he whose moments were numbered, was"
880,OLIVE LEAVES.,"directed to stand. His noble forehead, and quivering lips were alike"
881,OLIVE LEAVES.,"pale. Yet in his deportment there was a struggle for fortitude, like one"
882,OLIVE LEAVES.,who had resolved to meet death unmoved.
883,OLIVE LEAVES.,
884,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""May I speak to the soldiers?"" he said. It was the voice of Frank"
885,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Ludlow. Permission was given, and he spoke something of warning against"
886,OLIVE LEAVES.,"desertion, and something, in deep bitterness, against the spirit of war."
887,OLIVE LEAVES.,"But his tones were so hurried and agitated, that their import could"
888,OLIVE LEAVES.,scarcely be gathered.
889,OLIVE LEAVES.,
890,OLIVE LEAVES.,The eye of the commanding officer was fixed on the watch which he held
891,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in his hand. ""The time has come,"" he said, ""Kneel upon your coffin."""
892,OLIVE LEAVES.,
893,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The cap was drawn over the eyes of the miserable man. He murmured, with"
894,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a stifled sob, ""God, I thank thee, that my dear ones cannot see this."""
895,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Then from the bottom of his soul, burst forth a cry,"
896,OLIVE LEAVES.,
897,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""O mother! mother! had I but believed""--"
898,OLIVE LEAVES.,
899,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Ere the sentence was finished, a sword glittered in the sunbeam. It was"
900,OLIVE LEAVES.,the death-signal. Eight soldiers advanced from the ranks. There was a
901,OLIVE LEAVES.,sharp report of arms. A shriek of piercing anguish. One convulsive leap.
902,OLIVE LEAVES.,And then a dead man lay between his coffin and his grave.
903,OLIVE LEAVES.,
904,OLIVE LEAVES.,"There was a shuddering silence. Afterwards, the whole line was directed"
905,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to march by the lifeless body, that every one might for himself see the"
906,OLIVE LEAVES.,punishment of a deserter.
907,OLIVE LEAVES.,
908,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Suddenly, there was some confusion; and all eyes turned towards a"
909,OLIVE LEAVES.,"horseman, approaching at breathless speed. Alighting, he attempted to"
910,OLIVE LEAVES.,"raise the dead man, who had fallen with his face downward. Gazing"
911,OLIVE LEAVES.,"earnestly upon the rigid features, he clasped the mangled and bleeding"
912,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bosom to his own. Even the sternest veteran was moved, at the"
913,OLIVE LEAVES.,"heart-rending cry of ""_Brother! O my brother!_"""
914,OLIVE LEAVES.,
915,OLIVE LEAVES.,No one disturbed the bitter grief which the living poured forth in
916,OLIVE LEAVES.,broken sentences over the dead.
917,OLIVE LEAVES.,
918,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Gone to thine account! Gone to thine everlasting account! Is it indeed"
919,OLIVE LEAVES.,"thy heart's blood, that trickles warmly upon me? My brother, would that"
920,OLIVE LEAVES.,I might have been with thee in thy dreary prison. Would that we might
921,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have breathed together one more prayer, that I might have seen thee look"
922,OLIVE LEAVES.,"unto Jesus of Nazareth."""
923,OLIVE LEAVES.,
924,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Rising up from the corpse, and turning to the commanding officer, he"
925,OLIVE LEAVES.,"spoke through his tears, with a tremulous, yet sweet-toned voice."
926,OLIVE LEAVES.,
927,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""And what was the crime, for which my brother was condemned to this"
928,OLIVE LEAVES.,death? There beats no more loyal heart in the bosom of any of these
929,OLIVE LEAVES.,"men, who do the bidding of their country. His greatest fault, the source"
930,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of all his misery, was the love of war. In the bright days of his"
931,OLIVE LEAVES.,"boyhood, he said he would be content to die on the field of battle. See,"
932,OLIVE LEAVES.,"you have taken away his life, in cold blood, among his own people, and"
933,OLIVE LEAVES.,"no eye hath pitied him."""
934,OLIVE LEAVES.,
935,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The commandant stated briefly and calmly, that desertion thrice repeated"
936,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was death, that the trial of his brother had been impartial, and the"
937,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sentence just. Something too, he added, about the necessity of enforcing"
938,OLIVE LEAVES.,"military discipline, and the exceeding danger of remissness in a point"
939,OLIVE LEAVES.,like this.
940,OLIVE LEAVES.,
941,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""If he must die, why was it hidden from those whose life was bound up in"
942,OLIVE LEAVES.,"his? Why were they left to learn from the idle voice of rumour, this"
943,OLIVE LEAVES.,death-blow to their happiness? If they might not have gained his pardon
944,OLIVE LEAVES.,"from an earthly tribunal, they would have been comforted by knowing that"
945,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he sought that mercy from above, which hath no limit. Fearful power have"
946,OLIVE LEAVES.,"ye, indeed, to kill the body, but why need you put the never-dying soul"
947,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in jeopardy? There are those, to whom the moving of the lips that you"
948,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have silenced, would have been most dear, though their only word had"
949,OLIVE LEAVES.,"been to say farewell. There are those, to whom the glance of that eye,"
950,OLIVE LEAVES.,"which you have sealed in blood, was like the clear shining of the sun"
951,OLIVE LEAVES.,"after rain. The wife of his bosom would have thanked you, might she but"
952,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have sat with him on the floor of his prison, and his infant son would"
953,OLIVE LEAVES.,"have played with his fettered hands, and lighted up his dark soul with"
954,OLIVE LEAVES.,"one more smile of innocence. The sister, to whom he has been as a"
955,OLIVE LEAVES.,"father, would have soothed his despairing spirit, with the hymn which in"
956,OLIVE LEAVES.,"infancy, she sang nightly with him, at their blessed mother's knee. Nor"
957,OLIVE LEAVES.,"would his only brother thus have mourned, might he but have poured the"
958,OLIVE LEAVES.,"consolations of the Gospel, once more upon that stricken wanderer, and"
959,OLIVE LEAVES.,"treasured up one tear of penitence."""
960,OLIVE LEAVES.,
961,OLIVE LEAVES.,"A burst of grief overpowered him. The officer with kindness assured him,"
962,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that it was no fault of theirs, that the family of his brother was not"
963,OLIVE LEAVES.,apprized of his situation. That he strenuously desired no tidings might
964,OLIVE LEAVES.,"be conveyed to them, saying that the sight of their sorrow would be more"
965,OLIVE LEAVES.,dreadful to him than his doom. During the brief interval between his
966,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sentence and execution, he had the devoted services of a holy man, to"
967,OLIVE LEAVES.,prepare him for the final hour.
968,OLIVE LEAVES.,
969,OLIVE LEAVES.,Edward Ludlow composed himself to listen to every word. The shock of
970,OLIVE LEAVES.,"surprise, with its tempest of tears, had past. As he stood with"
971,OLIVE LEAVES.,"uncovered brow, the bright locks clustering around his noble forehead,"
972,OLIVE LEAVES.,"it was seen how strongly he resembled his fallen brother, ere care and"
973,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sorrow had clouded his manly beauty. For a moment, his eyes were raised"
974,OLIVE LEAVES.,"upward, and his lips moved. Pious hearts felt that he was asking"
975,OLIVE LEAVES.,"strength from above, to rule his emotions, and to attain that"
976,OLIVE LEAVES.,"submission, which as a teacher of religion he enforced on others."
977,OLIVE LEAVES.,
978,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Turning meekly towards the commanding officer, he asked for the body of"
979,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the dead, that it might be borne once more to the desolate home of his"
980,OLIVE LEAVES.,"birth, and buried by the side of his father and his mother. The request"
981,OLIVE LEAVES.,was granted with sympathy.
982,OLIVE LEAVES.,
983,OLIVE LEAVES.,He addressed himself to the services connected with the removal of the
984,OLIVE LEAVES.,"body, as one who bows himself down to bear the will of the Almighty. And"
985,OLIVE LEAVES.,"as he raised the bleeding corpse of his beloved brother in his arms, he"
986,OLIVE LEAVES.,"said, ""O war! war! whose tender mercies are cruel, what _enmity_ is so"
987,OLIVE LEAVES.,"fearful to the soul, as _friendship_ with thee."""
988,OLIVE LEAVES.,

993,OLIVE LEAVES.,
994,OLIVE LEAVES.,
995,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Waft not to me the blast of fame,"
996,OLIVE LEAVES.,"That swells the trump of victory,"
997,OLIVE LEAVES.,For to my ear it gives the name
998,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Of slaughter, and of misery."
999,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1000,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Boast not so much of honour's sword,"
1001,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Wave not so high the victor's plume,"

1003,OLIVE LEAVES.,They point me to the blood-stained tomb.
1004,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1005,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The boastful shout, the revel loud,"
1006,OLIVE LEAVES.,"That strive to drown the voice of pain,"
1007,OLIVE LEAVES.,What are they but the fickle crowd
1008,OLIVE LEAVES.,Rejoicing o'er their brethren slain?
1009,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1010,OLIVE LEAVES.,"And, ah! through glory's fading blaze,"
1011,OLIVE LEAVES.,"I see the cottage taper, pale,"
1012,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Which sheds its faint and feeble rays,"
1013,OLIVE LEAVES.,Where unprotected orphans wail:
1014,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1015,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Where the sad widow weeping stands,"
1016,OLIVE LEAVES.,As if her day of hope was done;
1017,OLIVE LEAVES.,Where the wild mother clasps her hands
1018,OLIVE LEAVES.,And asks the victor for her son:
1019,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1020,OLIVE LEAVES.,Where the lone maid in secret sighs
1021,OLIVE LEAVES.,"O'er the lost solace of her heart,"
1022,OLIVE LEAVES.,"As prostrate in despair she lies,"
1023,OLIVE LEAVES.,And feels her tortur'd life depart:
1024,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1025,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Where midst that desolated land,"
1026,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The sire, lamenting o'er his son,"
1027,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Extends his pale and powerless hand,"
1028,OLIVE LEAVES.,And finds its only prop is gone.
1029,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1030,OLIVE LEAVES.,"See, how the bands of war and woe"
1031,OLIVE LEAVES.,Have rifled sweet domestic bliss;
1032,OLIVE LEAVES.,And tell me if your laurels grow
1033,OLIVE LEAVES.,And flourish in a soil like this?

1035,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1036,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1037,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1038,OLIVE LEAVES.,Silent People.
1039,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1040,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1041,OLIVE LEAVES.,"It was supposed in ancient times, that those who were deprived of"
1042,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hearing and speech, were shut out from knowledge. The ear was considered"
1043,OLIVE LEAVES.,as the only avenue to the mind. One of the early classic poets has said.
1044,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1045,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""To instruct the deaf, no art could ever reach,"
1046,OLIVE LEAVES.,"No care improve them, and no wisdom teach."""
1047,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1048,OLIVE LEAVES.,But the benevolence of our own days has achieved this difficult work.
1049,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Asylums for the education of mute children are multiplying among us, and"
1050,OLIVE LEAVES.,men of talents and learning labour to discover the best modes of adding
1051,OLIVE LEAVES.,to their dialect of pantomime the power of written language. The
1052,OLIVE LEAVES.,neighbourhood of one of these Institutions has furnished the opportunity
1053,OLIVE LEAVES.,of knowing the progress of many interesting pupils of that class. Their
1054,OLIVE LEAVES.,"ideas, especially on religious subjects, are generally very confused at"
1055,OLIVE LEAVES.,"their arrival there, even when much care has been bestowed upon them at"
1056,OLIVE LEAVES.,home.
1057,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1058,OLIVE LEAVES.,"A little deaf and dumb boy, who had the misfortune early to lose his"
1059,OLIVE LEAVES.,"father, received tender care and love from his mother and a younger"
1060,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sister, with whom it was his chief delight to play, from morning till"
1061,OLIVE LEAVES.,"night. After a few years, the village where they resided was visited"
1062,OLIVE LEAVES.,"with a dangerous fever, and this family all lay sick at the same time."
1063,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The mother and daughter died, but the poor little deaf and dumb orphan"
1064,OLIVE LEAVES.,"recovered. He had an aged grandmother who took him to her home, and"
1065,OLIVE LEAVES.,"seemed to love him better for his infirmities. She fed him carefully,"
1066,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and laid him in his bed with tenderness; and in her lonely situation, he"
1067,OLIVE LEAVES.,was all the world to her. Every day she laboured to understand his
1068,OLIVE LEAVES.,"signs, and to communicate some new idea to his imprisoned mind. She"
1069,OLIVE LEAVES.,"endeavoured to instruct him that there was a Great Being, who caused the"
1070,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sun to shine, and the grass to grow; who sent forth the lightning and"
1071,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the rain, and was the Maker of man and beast. She taught him the three"
1072,OLIVE LEAVES.,"letters G O and D; and when he saw in a book this name of the Almighty,"
1073,OLIVE LEAVES.,he was accustomed to bow down his head with the deepest reverence. But
1074,OLIVE LEAVES.,"when she sought to inform him that he had a soul, accountable, and"
1075,OLIVE LEAVES.,"immortal when the body died, she was grieved that he seemed not to"
1076,OLIVE LEAVES.,"comprehend her. The little silent boy loved his kind grandmother, and"
1077,OLIVE LEAVES.,"would sit for hours looking earnestly in her wrinkled face, smiling, and"
1078,OLIVE LEAVES.,endeavouring to sustain the conversation. He was anxious to perform any
1079,OLIVE LEAVES.,service for her that might testify his affection; he would fly to pick
1080,OLIVE LEAVES.,"up her knitting-bag or her snuff-box when they fell, and traverse the"
1081,OLIVE LEAVES.,"neighbouring meadows and woods, to gather such flowers and plants as"
1082,OLIVE LEAVES.,pleased her. Yet he was sometimes pensive and wept; she knew not why.
1083,OLIVE LEAVES.,"She supposed he might be grieving for the relatives he had lost, and"
1084,OLIVE LEAVES.,redoubled her marks of tenderness. She often perused with great
1085,OLIVE LEAVES.,"interest, accounts of the intelligence and happiness of the deaf and"
1086,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dumb, who enjoy a system of education, adapted to their necessities, and"
1087,OLIVE LEAVES.,"thought if any thing could separate her from her beloved charge, it"
1088,OLIVE LEAVES.,would be that he might share such an inestimable privilege.
1089,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1090,OLIVE LEAVES.,"At length, the eyes of this benevolent lady grew dim through age, and"
1091,OLIVE LEAVES.,"when the little suppliant, by his dialect of gestures, besought her"
1092,OLIVE LEAVES.,"attention, she was unable to distinguish the movements of his hands, or"
1093,OLIVE LEAVES.,scarcely the form of his features. It was then her earnest request that
1094,OLIVE LEAVES.,"he might be placed at the American Asylum in Hartford, for the education"
1095,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of the deaf and dumb. There, when his first regrets at separation had"
1096,OLIVE LEAVES.,"subsided, he began to make rapid improvement. He became attached to his"
1097,OLIVE LEAVES.,"companions and teachers, and both in his studies and sports, was happy."
1098,OLIVE LEAVES.,When he had nearly completed the period allotted for a full course of
1099,OLIVE LEAVES.,"instruction, a conversation like the following took place one evening,"
1100,OLIVE LEAVES.,between him and a preceptor whom he loved:
1101,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1102,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I have frequently desired to ask what were some of your opinions,"
1103,OLIVE LEAVES.,"before you became a pupil in this Institution. What, for instance, were"
1104,OLIVE LEAVES.,"your ideas of the sun and moon?"""
1105,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1106,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I supposed that the sun was a king and a warrior, who ruled over, and"
1107,OLIVE LEAVES.,"slew the people, as he pleased. When I saw brightness in the west, at"
1108,OLIVE LEAVES.,"closing day, I thought it was the flame and smoke of cities which he had"
1109,OLIVE LEAVES.,"destroyed in his wrath. The moon, I much disliked. I considered her"
1110,OLIVE LEAVES.,"prying and officious, because she looked into my chamber when I wished"
1111,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to sleep. One evening, I walked in the garden, and the half-moon seemed"
1112,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to follow me. I sought the shade of some large trees, but found she was"
1113,OLIVE LEAVES.,"there before me. I turned to go into the house, and advised her not to"
1114,OLIVE LEAVES.,"come, because I hated her. But when I lay down in my bed, she was there."
1115,OLIVE LEAVES.,I arose and closed the blinds. Still there were crevices through which
1116,OLIVE LEAVES.,"she peeped. I bade her _go away_, and wept with passion, because she"
1117,OLIVE LEAVES.,"disregarded my wishes. I suspected that she gazed at me, more than at"
1118,OLIVE LEAVES.,"others, because I was deaf and dumb, and that she would tell strangers"
1119,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of it, for I felt ashamed of being different from other children."""
1120,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1121,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""What did you think of the stars?"""
1122,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1123,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""They were more agreeable to me. I imagined that they were fair and"
1124,OLIVE LEAVES.,"well-dressed ladies, who gave brilliant parties in the sky; and that"
1125,OLIVE LEAVES.,"they sometimes rode for amusement, on beautiful horses, carrying large"
1126,OLIVE LEAVES.,"candles in their hands."""
1127,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1128,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Had you any conception of death?"""
1129,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1130,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""When my little sister died, I wondered why she lay still so long. I"
1131,OLIVE LEAVES.,thought she was lazy to be sleeping when the sun had arisen. I gathered
1132,OLIVE LEAVES.,"violets, and threw them in her face, and said in my dialect of signs,"
1133,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Wake up; wake up!"" And I was displeased at her, and went so far as to"
1134,OLIVE LEAVES.,"say, ""What a fool you are!"" when she permitted them to put her in a box,"
1135,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and carry her away, instead of getting up to play with me."
1136,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1137,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""Afterwards, when my mother died, they told me repeatedly, that she was"
1138,OLIVE LEAVES.,"_dead, dead_; and tried to explain to me what death meant. But I was"
1139,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distressed when I asked her for bread, that she did not give it to me;"
1140,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and when she was buried, I went every day where they had laid her,"
1141,OLIVE LEAVES.,"waiting, and expecting that she would rise. Sometimes I grew impatient,"
1142,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and rolled upon the turf that covered her, striking my forehead against"
1143,OLIVE LEAVES.,"it, weeping and saying, ""Mother, get up! get up! why do you sleep there"
1144,OLIVE LEAVES.,"so long with the child? I am sick, and hungry, and alone. Oh, Mother!"
1145,OLIVE LEAVES.,"mother! get up!"" When I was taken to my grandmother's house, I could no"
1146,OLIVE LEAVES.,"longer visit the grave, and it grieved me; for I believed if I continued"
1147,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to go and cry there, she would at length hear me and come up."""
1148,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1149,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""I know that more pains were taken to instil religious principles into"
1150,OLIVE LEAVES.,"your mind, than are commonly bestowed upon the deaf and dumb. Will you"
1151,OLIVE LEAVES.,"tell me what was your opinion of the Supreme Being?"""
1152,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1153,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""My kind grandmother laboured without ceasing, to impress me with"
1154,OLIVE LEAVES.,reverence for the Almighty. Through her efforts I obtained some idea of
1155,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the power and goodness which are visible in creation; but of HIM, who"
1156,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wrought in the storm and in the sunshine, I was doubtful whether it were"
1157,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a strong man, a huge animal, or a vast machine. I was in all the"
1158,OLIVE LEAVES.,"ignorance of heathen sin, until by patient attendance on your judicious"
1159,OLIVE LEAVES.,"course of instruction, knowledge entered into my soul."""
1160,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1161,OLIVE LEAVES.,"He then expressed to his teacher, the gratitude he felt for the"
1162,OLIVE LEAVES.,"blessings of education, and affectionately wishing him a good night,"
1163,OLIVE LEAVES.,retired to repose.
1164,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1165,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Instances of the development of kind affections and religious hopes, are"
1166,OLIVE LEAVES.,often touchingly displayed among the children who share in the privation
1167,OLIVE LEAVES.,of hearing and speech. This was peculiarly the case with two little
1168,OLIVE LEAVES.,"silent sisters, beautiful in person and of gentle dispositions. Their"
1169,OLIVE LEAVES.,"names were Phebe and Frances Hammond. The eldest was a very fair,"
1170,OLIVE LEAVES.,"interesting child. She was deaf and dumb from her birth, but from"
1171,OLIVE LEAVES.,infancy showed quick perceptions and a lively attention to every object
1172,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that passed before the eye. She seemed perfectly happy, when the little"
1173,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sister, two and a half years younger, and like herself mute, was old"
1174,OLIVE LEAVES.,enough to play with her. She would lead her with the greatest
1175,OLIVE LEAVES.,"gentleness, keeping watch lest she should get hurt, with a tender,"
1176,OLIVE LEAVES.,continual care. When they were permitted to amuse themselves out of
1177,OLIVE LEAVES.,"doors, if she saw any thing approaching which she feared, she thought"
1178,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not of herself, but encircled the little one in her arms, and by cries"
1179,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sought for her relief and protection. If they wished to climb a fence,"
1180,OLIVE LEAVES.,"she would proceed at first, alone, trying every part, to be sure of its"
1181,OLIVE LEAVES.,"safety, ere she returned to aid her darling sister, keeping a firm hold"
1182,OLIVE LEAVES.,"on her as she ascended, and jumping over on the other side, to extend"
1183,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her little arm and lift her tenderly down. It was a touching sight, to"
1184,OLIVE LEAVES.,"view these silent children, at their healthful sports upon the smooth"
1185,OLIVE LEAVES.,"green lawn, or beneath the shade of spreading trees, supplying as it"
1186,OLIVE LEAVES.,"were, the deficiency of Nature, by an increased exercise of the"
1187,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sweetest, most sustaining affections."
1188,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1189,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Ere long, they expressed their desire to attend school, that they might"
1190,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""learn to do, like other children."" Here they were very diligent, and by"
1191,OLIVE LEAVES.,"great attention from the instructress were taught to sew, to write, and"
1192,OLIVE LEAVES.,to spell many words. Visitants of the school expressed surprise at the
1193,OLIVE LEAVES.,"neatness of their needle-work, and chirography."
1194,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1195,OLIVE LEAVES.,"When they were brought by their father, from their home in"
1196,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Massachusetts, to the Asylum for the deaf and dumb, in Hartford, Phebe"
1197,OLIVE LEAVES.,"was ten, and Frances seven and a half years old. There was at that time"
1198,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a regulation in force, that no pupil under the age of ten years, could"
1199,OLIVE LEAVES.,"be received, being supposed unable to derive full benefit from their"
1200,OLIVE LEAVES.,system of instruction.
1201,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1202,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Yet these little silent sisters, who had been together night and day,"
1203,OLIVE LEAVES.,"whose features and garb were the same, the smile or the sadness of one"
1204,OLIVE LEAVES.,"face being suddenly reflected on the other, as if but one soul animated"
1205,OLIVE LEAVES.,"two bodies, how could they be parted? The idea of a separate existence,"
1206,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a divided pleasure, had never entered their minds. Now, they gazed on"
1207,OLIVE LEAVES.,each other with an expression of the deepest anguish. They folded each
1208,OLIVE LEAVES.,other in their arms. No power of speech was so eloquent as their
1209,OLIVE LEAVES.,imploring looks. The law relaxed its prohibition in their case. They
1210,OLIVE LEAVES.,were permitted to remain together.
1211,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1212,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Phebe took her seat immediately among the one hundred and forty pupils,"
1213,OLIVE LEAVES.,"forgetting in her desire to learn, the embarrassment of a stranger."
1214,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Little Frances was more diffident, and clung to her as to a mother,"
1215,OLIVE LEAVES.,never for a moment disappointed in finding the tenderest sympathy and
1216,OLIVE LEAVES.,love. Soon they became cheerful and happy. Their affectionate hearts
1217,OLIVE LEAVES.,"were open to every innocent pleasure. Though the youngest in school,"
1218,OLIVE LEAVES.,they were so docile and industrious as to obtain a rank among the best
1219,OLIVE LEAVES.,"scholars; and when the lessons of each day were over, they comforted"
1220,OLIVE LEAVES.,"themselves with their sweet, sisterly love. If one received the simplest"
1221,OLIVE LEAVES.,"gift, it was instantly shared; if it could not be divided it was"
1222,OLIVE LEAVES.,considered as the property of both.
1223,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1224,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Phebe taught the little one to keep her clothes without spot or stain,"
1225,OLIVE LEAVES.,and to put every article in its proper place. She led her by the hand
1226,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wherever she went, and if there was a tear on her cheek she kissed it"
1227,OLIVE LEAVES.,"away. Little Frances looked up to her, with the most endearing and"
1228,OLIVE LEAVES.,"perfect confidence. When they went home, at the vacations in spring and"
1229,OLIVE LEAVES.,"autumn, the affectionate deportment of these beautiful mute children,"
1230,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and their progress in the dialect of signs, as well as in written"
1231,OLIVE LEAVES.,"speech, was admired by all. After they had enjoyed the benefit of"
1232,OLIVE LEAVES.,"instruction somewhat more than two years, Phebe was observed to have a"
1233,OLIVE LEAVES.,"slight cough, and being taken ill, was obliged to return to her parents."
1234,OLIVE LEAVES.,Symptoms of consumption were too plainly revealed to be mistaken. As she
1235,OLIVE LEAVES.,"became more emaciated and feeble, she desired to be carried every day at"
1236,OLIVE LEAVES.,"a certain hour, into an unoccupied room, and left for a while, by"
1237,OLIVE LEAVES.,"herself. On being asked why she wished this, she answered that she might"
1238,OLIVE LEAVES.,better lift up her thoughts to Him who heareth prayer.
1239,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1240,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""In heaven,"" she said, ""there are babes, and children, and persons of"
1241,OLIVE LEAVES.,"every age. I think I have seen this in my mind, in a bright dream. I am"
1242,OLIVE LEAVES.,"so weak, I shall die. I pray that I may go to heaven. Oh! I wish Frances"
1243,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to love God. She is my good sister."""
1244,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1245,OLIVE LEAVES.,She was asked if it was her wish to live and be restored to health. She
1246,OLIVE LEAVES.,"replied,"
1247,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1248,OLIVE LEAVES.,"""No, I would see Jesus."""
1249,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1250,OLIVE LEAVES.,"So, in quietness and peace, the voiceless spirit of the loving child"
1251,OLIVE LEAVES.,"departed, to rejoice, we trust, amid the melodies of heaven. Sweet,"
1252,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sisterly affection seemed to have been her principal solace, here below."
1253,OLIVE LEAVES.,"And if it was capable of imparting such happiness to these deaf mutes,"
1254,OLIVE LEAVES.,"surely the children who are blessed with hearing and speech, might still"
1255,OLIVE LEAVES.,"more fully enjoy, and exemplify it. All who have brothers and sisters"
1256,OLIVE LEAVES.,"should perform their duty tenderly towards them, with constant gratitude"
1257,OLIVE LEAVES.,to Him who has vouchsafed them the comfort of such relations.
1258,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1259,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Any little departure from kindness, will cause painful remembrances in a"
1260,OLIVE LEAVES.,"time of bereavement. A boy was seen often at the grave of a brother,"
1261,OLIVE LEAVES.,younger than himself. He hid his face upon the grassy mound and wept
1262,OLIVE LEAVES.,"bitterly. A friend who once saw him there, said, ""How much you loved"
1263,OLIVE LEAVES.,"your brother."" But he replied through his tears, ""My grief is because I"
1264,OLIVE LEAVES.,"did not love him more."""
1265,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1266,OLIVE LEAVES.,We have spoken of silent people. I can tell you of one who suffers a
1267,OLIVE LEAVES.,"still heavier calamity. At the same Institution for the deaf and dumb,"
1268,OLIVE LEAVES.,"is a girl, to whom noonday and midnight are the same, who takes no"
1269,OLIVE LEAVES.,"pleasure in the summer landscape or the fair changes of nature, hears"
1270,OLIVE LEAVES.,"not the sound of brooks bursting loose in spring, nor the song of birds,"
1271,OLIVE LEAVES.,"nor the laughter of the young child, neither looks upon the face of"
1272,OLIVE LEAVES.,"mother or of friend. She is not only deaf and dumb, but blind. Her name"
1273,OLIVE LEAVES.,is Julia Brace. Her earliest years were spent in the home of her
1274,OLIVE LEAVES.,"parents, who were poor, and had several younger children. Of all their"
1275,OLIVE LEAVES.,"movements she was observant, as far as her state would allow; and when"
1276,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the weather was cold, would sometimes kneel on the floor of their humble"
1277,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dwelling, to feel if their little feet were naked as well as her own. If"
1278,OLIVE LEAVES.,"she ascertained that others, and not herself, were furnished with shoes"
1279,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and stockings, she would express uneasiness at the contrast. Her"
1280,OLIVE LEAVES.,"perception, with regard to articles of dress, was more accurate than"
1281,OLIVE LEAVES.,"could have been expected, and when any gifts were presented her, soon"
1282,OLIVE LEAVES.,ascertained and preferred those which were of the most delicate texture.
1283,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Seated on her little block, weaving thin strips of bark with bits of"
1284,OLIVE LEAVES.,"leather, which her father who was a shoemaker threw away, she"
1285,OLIVE LEAVES.,"constructed for her cat, strange bonnets, or other ornaments, equally"
1286,OLIVE LEAVES.,"rude, and yet not wholly discordant with the principles of taste."
1287,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1288,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Sometimes, when the mother went out to a day's work of washing, she left"
1289,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Julia, notwithstanding her peculiar helplessness, with the care of the"
1290,OLIVE LEAVES.,"younger children. On such occasions, she evinced more of maternal"
1291,OLIVE LEAVES.,"solicitude, and even of skill in domestic legislation than could have"
1292,OLIVE LEAVES.,been rationally expected.
1293,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1294,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Once, when a dish had been broken, she imitated what she supposed might"
1295,OLIVE LEAVES.,"be her mother's discipline, and shook the little careless offender with"
1296,OLIVE LEAVES.,"some force. Then placing her hand upon its eyes, and discovering that it"
1297,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wept, and considering the act of discipline complete, she hastened to"
1298,OLIVE LEAVES.,"take it in her arms and press it to her bosom, and by preserving"
1299,OLIVE LEAVES.,"tenderness, soothe it into good-humour and confidence."
1300,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1301,OLIVE LEAVES.,"While yet a child, her parents were relieved from the expense of her"
1302,OLIVE LEAVES.,"maintenance, by some charitable ladies, who placed her in the family of"
1303,OLIVE LEAVES.,an elderly matron who kept a small day-school. Her curiosity was now
1304,OLIVE LEAVES.,"called forth into great activity, to search out the employments of the"
1305,OLIVE LEAVES.,"scholars, and try to imitate them. She observed that much of their time"
1306,OLIVE LEAVES.,was occupied with books. So she held a book long before her own
1307,OLIVE LEAVES.,"sightless eyes. But no knowledge visited her imprisoned mind. Then, she"
1308,OLIVE LEAVES.,"held an open book before the face of her favourite kitten, feeling its"
1309,OLIVE LEAVES.,"mouth at the same time, and perceiving that its lips did not move, shook"
1310,OLIVE LEAVES.,"its shoulder and rapped its ear, to quicken its imitation of the"
1311,OLIVE LEAVES.,studious children.
1312,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1313,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Trifling as these circumstances are in themselves, they show perception,"
1314,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and perseverance, struggling against the barriers that Nature had"
1315,OLIVE LEAVES.,"interposed. Needle-work and knitting had been taught her, and from these"
1316,OLIVE LEAVES.,employments she drew her principal solace. With these she would busy
1317,OLIVE LEAVES.,"herself for hours, until it became necessary to prompt her to the"
1318,OLIVE LEAVES.,"exercise that health required. Counterpanes, patiently constructed by"
1319,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her, of small pieces of calico, were sold to aid in supplying her"
1320,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wardrobe, and specimens of her work were distributed by her patrons, to"
1321,OLIVE LEAVES.,"prove of what nicety and industry the poor, blind, and silent girl was"
1322,OLIVE LEAVES.,capable.
1323,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1324,OLIVE LEAVES.,It was sometimes an amusement to her visitants to give into her hand
1325,OLIVE LEAVES.,"their watches, and test a peculiar sagacity which she possessed, in"
1326,OLIVE LEAVES.,"restoring each to its owner. Though their position with regard to her,"
1327,OLIVE LEAVES.,"or to each other, was frequently and studiously varied, and though she"
1328,OLIVE LEAVES.,"might hold at the same time, two or three watches, neither stratagem nor"
1329,OLIVE LEAVES.,"persuasion could induce her to yield either, except to the person from"
1330,OLIVE LEAVES.,"whom she received it. This tenacity of principle, to give every one his"
1331,OLIVE LEAVES.,"own, might be resolved into that moral honesty which has ever formed a"
1332,OLIVE LEAVES.,"conspicuous part of her character. Though nurtured in poverty, and"
1333,OLIVE LEAVES.,"after her removal from the parental roof, in the constant habit of being"
1334,OLIVE LEAVES.,in contact with articles of dress or food which strongly tempted her
1335,OLIVE LEAVES.,"desires, she has never been known to appropriate to herself, without"
1336,OLIVE LEAVES.,"permission, the most trifling object. In a well-educated child, this"
1337,OLIVE LEAVES.,"might be no remarkable virtue; but in one, whose sealed ear can receive"
1338,OLIVE LEAVES.,"no explanation of the rights of property, and whose perfect blindness"
1339,OLIVE LEAVES.,"must often render it difficult even to define them, the incorruptible"
1340,OLIVE LEAVES.,firmness of this innate principle is truly laudable. There is also
1341,OLIVE LEAVES.,"connected with it a delicacy of feeling, or scrupulousness of"
1342,OLIVE LEAVES.,"conscience, which renders it necessary, in presenting her any gift, to"
1343,OLIVE LEAVES.,"assure her repeatedly, by a sign which she understands, that it is _for"
1344,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her_, ere she will consent to accept it."
1345,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1346,OLIVE LEAVES.,"After her admission into the Asylum for the deaf and dumb, in Hartford,"
1347,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her native place, efforts were made by one of the benevolent instructors"
1348,OLIVE LEAVES.,in that Institution to teach her the alphabet. For this purpose raised
1349,OLIVE LEAVES.,"letters, as well as those indented beneath a smooth surface, were put in"
1350,OLIVE LEAVES.,"requisition. Punctually she repaired to the school-room, with the seeing"
1351,OLIVE LEAVES.,"pupils, and spent hour after hour in imitating with pins upon a cushion,"
1352,OLIVE LEAVES.,the forms of each separate letter. But all in vain. However accurate her
1353,OLIVE LEAVES.,"delineations might sometimes be, they conveyed no idea to the mind,"
1354,OLIVE LEAVES.,sitting in thick darkness. It was therefore deemed best that it should
1355,OLIVE LEAVES.,pursue those occupations which more immediately ministered to its
1356,OLIVE LEAVES.,comfort and satisfaction.
1357,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1358,OLIVE LEAVES.,"It has been observed that persons who are deprived any one sense, have"
1359,OLIVE LEAVES.,additional vigour infused into those that remain. Thus blind persons are
1360,OLIVE LEAVES.,"distinguished by exquisite delicacy of touch, and the deaf and dumb"
1361,OLIVE LEAVES.,"concentrate their whole souls in the eye, their only avenue to"
1362,OLIVE LEAVES.,"knowledge. But with her, whose ear, eye, and tongue, are alike dead to"
1363,OLIVE LEAVES.,"action, the power of the olfactory organs is so heightened, as almost to"
1364,OLIVE LEAVES.,form a new and peculiar sense. It almost transcends the sagacity of the
1365,OLIVE LEAVES.,spaniel.
1366,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1367,OLIVE LEAVES.,"As the abodes which from her earliest recollection she had inhabited,"
1368,OLIVE LEAVES.,"were circumscribed and humble, it was supposed that at her first"
1369,OLIVE LEAVES.,"reception into the Asylum, she might testify surprise. But she"
1370,OLIVE LEAVES.,immediately busied herself in quietly exploring the size of the
1371,OLIVE LEAVES.,"apartments, and smelled at the thresholds, and then, as if by the union"
1372,OLIVE LEAVES.,"of a mysterious geometry with a powerful memory, never made a false step"
1373,OLIVE LEAVES.,"upon a flight of stairs, or entered a wrong door, or mistook her seat at"
1374,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the table. At the tea-table with the whole family, on sending her cup to"
1375,OLIVE LEAVES.,"be replenished, if one is accidentally returned to her, which has been"
1376,OLIVE LEAVES.,"used by another person, she perceives it in a moment, and pushes it from"
1377,OLIVE LEAVES.,"her with some slight appearance of disgust, as if her sense of propriety"
1378,OLIVE LEAVES.,"had been invaded. There is not the slightest difference in the cups, and"
1379,OLIVE LEAVES.,in this instance she seems endowed by a sense of penetration not
1380,OLIVE LEAVES.,possessed by those in the full enjoyment of sight.
1381,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1382,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Among her various excellencies, neatness and love of order are"
1383,OLIVE LEAVES.,"conspicuous. Her simple wardrobe is systematically arranged, and it is"
1384,OLIVE LEAVES.,"impossible to displace a single article in her drawers, without her"
1385,OLIVE LEAVES.,perceiving and reinstating it. When the large baskets of clean linen are
1386,OLIVE LEAVES.,"weekly brought from the laundress, she selects her own garments without"
1387,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hesitation, however widely they may be dispersed among the mass. If any"
1388,OLIVE LEAVES.,"part of her dress requires mending, she is prompt and skilful in"
1389,OLIVE LEAVES.,"repairing it, and her perseverance in this branch of economy greatly"
1390,OLIVE LEAVES.,diminishes the expense of her clothing.
1391,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1392,OLIVE LEAVES.,The donations of charitable visitants are deposited in a box with an
1393,OLIVE LEAVES.,"inscription, and she has been made to understand that the contents are"
1394,OLIVE LEAVES.,"devoted to her benefit. This box she frequently poises in her hand, and"
1395,OLIVE LEAVES.,"expresses pleasure when it testifies an increase of weight, for she has"
1396,OLIVE LEAVES.,long since ascertained that money is the medium for the supply of her
1397,OLIVE LEAVES.,"wants, and attaches to it a proportionable value."
1398,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1399,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Though her habits are perfectly regular and consistent, yet"
1400,OLIVE LEAVES.,"occasionally, some action occurs which it is difficult to explain. One"
1401,OLIVE LEAVES.,"summer morning, while employed with her needle, she found herself"
1402,OLIVE LEAVES.,"incommoded by the warmth of the sun. She arose, opened the window,"
1403,OLIVE LEAVES.,"closed the blinds, and again resumed her work. This movement, though"
1404,OLIVE LEAVES.,"perfectly simple in a young child, who had seen it performed by others,"
1405,OLIVE LEAVES.,must in her case have required a more complex train of reasoning. How
1406,OLIVE LEAVES.,"did she know that the heat which she felt was caused by the sun, or that"
1407,OLIVE LEAVES.,by interposing an opaque body she might exclude his rays?
1408,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1409,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Persons most intimately acquainted with her habits assert, that she"
1410,OLIVE LEAVES.,"constantly regards the recurrence of the Sabbath, and composes herself"
1411,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to a deeper quietness of meditation. Her needle-work, from which she"
1412,OLIVE LEAVES.,"will not consent to be debarred on other days, she never attempts to"
1413,OLIVE LEAVES.,"resort to, and this wholly without influence from those around her. Who"
1414,OLIVE LEAVES.,can have impressed upon her benighted mind the sacredness of that day?
1415,OLIVE LEAVES.,"and by what art does she, who is ignorant of all numerical calculation,"
1416,OLIVE LEAVES.,compute without error the period of its rotation? A philosopher who
1417,OLIVE LEAVES.,"should make this mysterious being his study, might find much to astonish"
1418,OLIVE LEAVES.,"him, and perhaps something to throw light upon the structure of the"
1419,OLIVE LEAVES.,human mind.
1420,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1421,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Before her entrance at the Asylum, it was one of her sources of"
1422,OLIVE LEAVES.,satisfaction to be permitted to lay her hand upon the persons who
1423,OLIVE LEAVES.,"visited her, and thus to scrutinize with some minuteness, their"
1424,OLIVE LEAVES.,"features, or the nature of their apparel. It seemed to constitute one"
1425,OLIVE LEAVES.,"mode of intercourse with her fellow-beings, which was soothing to her"
1426,OLIVE LEAVES.,"lonely heart, and sometimes gave rise to degrees of admiration or"
1427,OLIVE LEAVES.,"dislike, not always to be accounted for by those whose judgment rested"
1428,OLIVE LEAVES.,upon the combined evidence of all their senses. But since her removal to
1429,OLIVE LEAVES.,"this noble institution, where the visits of strangers are so numerous as"
1430,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to cease to be a novelty, she has discontinued this species of"
1431,OLIVE LEAVES.,"attention, and is not pleased with any long interruption to her"
1432,OLIVE LEAVES.,established system of industry.
1433,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1434,OLIVE LEAVES.,"The genial influences of spring wake her lone heart to gladness, and she"
1435,OLIVE LEAVES.,"gathers the first flowers, and even the young blades of grass, and"
1436,OLIVE LEAVES.,inhales their freshness with a delight bordering on transport.
1437,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Sometimes, when apparently in deep thought, she is observed to burst"
1438,OLIVE LEAVES.,"into laughter, as if her associations of ideas were favourable, not only"
1439,OLIVE LEAVES.,"to cheerfulness, but to mirth. The society of the female pupils at the"
1440,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Asylum is soothing to her feelings, and their habitual kind offices,"
1441,OLIVE LEAVES.,"their guiding arm in her walks, or the affectionate pressure of their"
1442,OLIVE LEAVES.,"hands, awaken in her demonstrations of gratitude and friendship. One of"
1443,OLIVE LEAVES.,"them was sick, but it was not supposed that amid the multitude that"
1444,OLIVE LEAVES.,"surrounded her, the blind girl would be conscious of her absence. A"
1445,OLIVE LEAVES.,"physician was called, and she was made to understand his profession by"
1446,OLIVE LEAVES.,"placing a finger upon her pulse. She immediately arose, and led him with"
1447,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the earnest solicitude of friendship to the bedside of the invalid,"
1448,OLIVE LEAVES.,placing her hand in his with an affecting confidence in the power of
1449,OLIVE LEAVES.,"healing. As she has herself never been sick, it is the more surprising"
1450,OLIVE LEAVES.,that she should so readily comprehend the efficacy and benevolence of
1451,OLIVE LEAVES.,the medical profession.
1452,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1453,OLIVE LEAVES.,Julia Brace is still an inmate of the Asylum at Hartford. She leads a
1454,OLIVE LEAVES.,"life of quiet industry, and apparent contentment. Some slight services"
1455,OLIVE LEAVES.,"in the domestic department supply the exercise that health requires, and"
1456,OLIVE LEAVES.,the remainder of the time she chooses to be employed in sewing or
1457,OLIVE LEAVES.,"knitting. Visitants often linger by her side, to witness the mystical"
1458,OLIVE LEAVES.,"process of threading her needle, which is accomplished rapidly by the"
1459,OLIVE LEAVES.,"aid of her tongue. So, the tongue that hath never spoken is still in"
1460,OLIVE LEAVES.,continual use.
1461,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1462,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Her youth is now past, and she seems to make few, if any, new mental"
1463,OLIVE LEAVES.,"acquisitions. Her sister in calamity, Laura Bridgman, of the Institution"
1464,OLIVE LEAVES.,"for the Blind in Boston, has far surpassed her in intellectual"
1465,OLIVE LEAVES.,"attainments, and excites the wondering admiration of every beholder. The"
1466,OLIVE LEAVES.,"felicity of her position, the untiring philanthropy of her patron, Dr."
1467,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Howe, and the constant devotion of an accomplished teacher, have"
1468,OLIVE LEAVES.,"probably produced this difference of result, more than any original"
1469,OLIVE LEAVES.,disparity of talents or capacity.
1470,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1471,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Julia, in her life of patient regularity, affords as strong a lesson as"
1472,OLIVE LEAVES.,can be given of the power of industry to soothe privation and to confer
1473,OLIVE LEAVES.,"content. While employed she is satisfied, but if at any time unprovided"
1474,OLIVE LEAVES.,"with work, her mind preys upon itself, not being able to gather ideas"
1475,OLIVE LEAVES.,"from surrounding objects, and having but a limited stock of knowledge to"
1476,OLIVE LEAVES.,furnish material for meditation. If this poor heart which is never to
1477,OLIVE LEAVES.,"thrill at the sound of a human voice, or be lifted up with joy at the"
1478,OLIVE LEAVES.,"fair scenery of earth, and sky and waters, finds in willing diligence a"
1479,OLIVE LEAVES.,"source of happiness, with how much more gladness should we turn to the"
1480,OLIVE LEAVES.,"pursuits of industry, who are impelled by motives and repaid by results"
1481,OLIVE LEAVES.,which she must never enjoy!
1482,OLIVE LEAVES.,
1483,OLIVE LEAVES.,"Dear young friends, who can see the smile on the faces of those whom you"
1484,OLIVE LEAVES.,"love, who can hear their approving voices, who can utter the words of"
1485,OLIVE LEAVES.,"knowledge, and rejoice in the glorious charms of nature, who know also"
1486,OLIVE LEAVES.,"that life is short, and that you must give strict account of it to God,"
1487,OLIVE LEAVES.,how faithfully and earnestly should you improve your time! You who have
1488,OLIVE LEAVES.,"the great, blessed gift of speech, be careful to make a right use of it."

1571,BOSTON,"her nursing cares and maternal caresses for a few weeks, then carried it"
1572,BOSTON,"back to the same neighbour, and left it in the same spot where she found"
1573,BOSTON,it. It would seem as if she wished to testify her approbation of the
1574,BOSTON,"home selected for her child, and desired only to nurture it until it"
1575,BOSTON,should be old enough to fill it properly.
1576,BOSTON,
1577,BOSTON,A cat who had repeatedly had her kittens taken from her and drowned
1578,BOSTON,"immediately after their birth, went to a barn belonging to the family,"
1579,BOSTON,quite at a long distance from the house. She so judiciously divided her
1580,BOSTON,"time, as to obtain her meals at home and attend to her nursery abroad."
1581,BOSTON,"At length she entered the kitchen, followed by four of her offspring,"
1582,BOSTON,"well-grown, all mewing in chorus. Had she foresight enough to conclude,"
1583,BOSTON,"that if she could protect them until they reached a more mature age,"
1584,BOSTON,they would escape the fate of their unfortunate kindred?
1585,BOSTON,
1586,BOSTON,"A little girl once sat reading, with a large favourite cat in her lap."
1587,BOSTON,"She was gently stroking it, while it purred loudly, to express its joy."
1588,BOSTON,"She invited a person who was near, to feel its velvet softness."
1589,BOSTON,Reluctant to be interrupted in an industrious occupation that required
1590,BOSTON,"the use of both hands, the person did not immediately comply, but at"
1591,BOSTON,length touched the head so abruptly that the cat supposed itself to have
1592,BOSTON,"been struck. Resenting the indignity, it ceased its song, and continued"
1593,BOSTON,"alternately rolling and closing its eyes, yet secretly watching, until"
1594,BOSTON,"both the busy hands had resumed their employment. Then, stretching forth"
1595,BOSTON,"a broad, black velvet paw, it inflicted on the back of one of them a"
1596,BOSTON,"quick stroke, and jumping down, concealed itself beneath the chair of"
1597,BOSTON,its patron. There seemed in this simple action a nice adaptation of
1598,BOSTON,"means to ends: a prudent waiting, until the retaliation that was"
1599,BOSTON,"meditated could be conveniently indulged, and a prompt flight from the"
1600,BOSTON,evil that might ensue.
1601,BOSTON,
1602,BOSTON,The race of rats are usually considered remarkable only for
1603,BOSTON,"voraciousness, or for ingenious and mischievous inventions to obtain the"
1604,BOSTON,gratification of appetite. A vessel that had been much infested by
1605,BOSTON,"them, was when in port fumigated with brimstone, to expel them. Escaping"
1606,BOSTON,"in great numbers, they were dispatched by people stationed for that"
1607,BOSTON,purpose. Amid the flying victims a group was observed to approach
1608,BOSTON,"slowly, upon the board placed between the vessel and the shore. One of"
1609,BOSTON,"those animals held in his mouth a stick, the extremities of which were"
1610,BOSTON,"held by two others, who carefully led him. It was discovered that he was"
1611,BOSTON,"entirely blind. The executioners making way for them, suffered them to"
1612,BOSTON,live. It was not in the heart of man to scorn such an example.
1613,BOSTON,
1614,BOSTON,"Another of our ships, while in a foreign port, took similar measures to"
1615,BOSTON,free itself from those troublesome inmates. Amid the throngs that fled
1616,BOSTON,"from suffocating smoke to slaughtering foes, one was seen moving"
1617,BOSTON,laboriously as if overburdened. Climbing over the bodies of his dead
1618,BOSTON,"companions, he bore upon his back another, so old as to be unable to"
1619,BOSTON,"walk. Like Eneas, escaping from the flames of Troy, perhaps it was an"
1620,BOSTON,aged father that he thus carried upon his shoulders. Whether it were
1621,BOSTON,"filial piety or respect for age, his noble conduct, as in the previous"
1622,BOSTON,"instance, saved his life and that of his venerable friend."
1623,BOSTON,
1624,BOSTON,"Sheep are admired for their innocence and meekness, more than for strong"
1625,BOSTON,demonstrations of character. Yet the owner of a flock was once surprised
1626,BOSTON,by seeing one of his fleecy people rushing to and fro beneath his
1627,BOSTON,"window, in great agitation and alarm. Following her to the pasture,"
1628,BOSTON,"where she eagerly led the way, he found a fierce dog tearing the sheep."
1629,BOSTON,"Having put him to flight, he turned in search of the messenger, and"
1630,BOSTON,"found her in a close thicket, where she had carefully hidden her own"
1631,BOSTON,"little lamb, ere she fled to apprize the master of their danger. This"
1632,BOSTON,strangely intelligent animal was permitted to live to the utmost limit
1633,BOSTON,of longevity allotted to her race.
1634,BOSTON,
1635,BOSTON,The instinct of the beaver approaches the bounds of reason. Their
1636,BOSTON,dexterity in constructing habitations and rearing mounds to repel the
1637,BOSTON,"watery element, surpasses that of all other animals. A gentleman who"
1638,BOSTON,"resided where they abound, wished to ascertain whether this was"
1639,BOSTON,"inherent, or the effect of imitation. He took therefore, to his house,"
1640,BOSTON,"an infant beaver, ere its eyes were opened. It was an inmate of his"
1641,BOSTON,"kitchen, where one day, from a leaky pail, a small stream of water oozed"
1642,BOSTON,"out upon the floor. Out ran the little beaver, and collected sticks and"
1643,BOSTON,"clay, with which it built a dam to stop the passage of the tiny brook."
1644,BOSTON,
1645,BOSTON,"An Indian, going out to shoot beaver, saw a large one felling a lofty"
1646,BOSTON,"tree. Ere he gave the finishing strokes, he ascended a neighbouring"
1647,BOSTON,"hill, throwing his head about, and taking deep draughts of air. The"
1648,BOSTON,"Indian, who stedfastly regarded him, supposed that he was taking an"
1649,BOSTON,observation of which way the wind blew: as when he made his last effort
1650,BOSTON,"on the tree, he made use of this knowledge to shelter himself from"
1651,BOSTON,injury at its fall. He then measured the trunk into equal lengths for
1652,BOSTON,"the height of the house he was to build, and loading his broad tail with"
1653,BOSTON,"wet clay, made a mark at each division. Uttering a peculiar cry, three"
1654,BOSTON,"little beavers appeared at their father's call, and began to knaw"
1655,BOSTON,asunder the wood at the places which he had designated.
1656,BOSTON,
1657,BOSTON,"""When I saw this,"" said the Indian, ""I turned away. Could I harm such a"
1658,BOSTON,"creature? No. He was to me as a brother."""
1659,BOSTON,
1660,BOSTON,"Among the insect tribes, the ant sustains a good character for foresight"
1661,BOSTON,"and industry, having been cited by the wise monarch of Israel as an"
1662,BOSTON,example and reproof to the sluggard. Their almost resistless force in
1663,BOSTON,"the tropical countries, where they move in bodies, shows the power that"
1664,BOSTON,the feeble may acquire through unity of effort and design.
1665,BOSTON,
1666,BOSTON,"When Dr. Franklin was on his embassy in France, soon after our"
1667,BOSTON,"Revolution, he one morning sat musing over his solitary breakfast, and"
1668,BOSTON,perceived a legion of large black ants taking possession of the
1669,BOSTON,"sugar-bowl. His philosophic mind being ever ready for experiments, he"
1670,BOSTON,caused it to be suspended from the ceiling by a string. They returned.
1671,BOSTON,The sweet food was above their reach. It was worth an effort to regain
1672,BOSTON,"it. One placed himself in a perpendicular position, and another mounted"
1673,BOSTON,"upon his shoulders. Others ascended the same scaffolding, each"
1674,BOSTON,stretching to his utmost altitude. Down fell the line. Yet it was again
1675,BOSTON,and again renewed. Then the Babel-builders disappeared. Had they given
1676,BOSTON,up the siege? No. They had only changed their mode of attack. Soon they
1677,BOSTON,"were seen traversing the ceiling, and precipitating themselves upon the"
1678,BOSTON,"coveted spoil, by the string that sustained it. Here was somewhat of the"
1679,BOSTON,"same boldness and perseverance that led Hannibal across the Alps, to"
1680,BOSTON,pour his soldiers down upon astonished Italy.
1681,BOSTON,
1682,BOSTON,"Thus the spider that sought so many times to fasten its frail thread,"
1683,BOSTON,"and at length succeeded, gave a profitable lesson to King Robert the"
1684,BOSTON,"Bruce, when he ruminated in discouragement and despair on his failing"
1685,BOSTON,enterprises.
1686,BOSTON,
1687,BOSTON,Parrots are generally considered as senseless repeaters of sounds and
1688,BOSTON,"words, that convey neither sentiment nor feeling. Now and then, there"
1689,BOSTON,seems some variation from this rule. A parrot who had been reared with
1690,BOSTON,"kindness, selected as his prime favourite the youngest child in the"
1691,BOSTON,family. By every means in his power he expressed this preference. The
1692,BOSTON,little girl was seized with a severe sickness. He missed her in her
1693,BOSTON,"accustomed haunts, and turning his head quickly from side to side,"
1694,BOSTON,called loudly for her.
1695,BOSTON,
1696,BOSTON,"At length, the fair form, stretched in its coffin, met his view. In wild"
1697,BOSTON,"and mournful tones, he continued to utter her name. He was removed far"
1698,BOSTON,"from the room, but the shrill echo of his voice was still heard amid the"
1699,BOSTON,"funeral obsequies, pronouncing with frantic grief the name of his lost"
1700,BOSTON,"Mary. Ever afterwards, when the sound of the tolling bell met his ear,"
1701,BOSTON,"the fountains of memory were troubled, and the cry of ""Mary! Mary!"""
1702,BOSTON,"mingled with the mournful knell, till it ceased."
1703,BOSTON,
1704,BOSTON,Since so many interesting properties are discovered in the inferior
1705,BOSTON,"creation, where, perhaps, we least expected them, it is well to search"
1706,BOSTON,"for such traits of character as deserve our regard, and consider them as"

1708,BOSTON,who has entrusted them to our protection.

1760,BOSTON,
1761,BOSTON,
1762,BOSTON,"There are ways in which boys may show true courage, without being"
1763,BOSTON,forward and bold in contention. It often requires more to avoid it. To
1764,BOSTON,"show forbearance when they are provoked, or to tell the whole truth when"
1765,BOSTON,"they have committed faults, are proofs of more lofty and high principle"
1766,BOSTON,"than to imitate the fighting animals, and repel force by force, or the"
1767,BOSTON,"fox-like ones, and practise cunning. To live at peace, may need more"
1768,BOSTON,"firmness than to quarrel; because one is to control our passions, and"
1769,BOSTON,the other to indulge them.
1770,BOSTON,
1771,BOSTON,"The bravest boy is he who rules himself, and does his duty without"
1772,BOSTON,boasting. I have known some beautiful instances of this class of

1774,BOSTON,
1775,BOSTON,"A widow, who was the mother of several children, resided in a pleasant"
1776,BOSTON,"part of New England. She faithfully nurtured and instructed them, and"
1777,BOSTON,"one of her precepts was, that when they had any difficult duty to"
1778,BOSTON,"perform, they should ask strength from above. Her youngest was a boy of"
1779,BOSTON,"eight years old, active and intelligent. He was not only obedient to"
1780,BOSTON,"her, but attentive to his studies, and beloved by his instructors."
1781,BOSTON,
1782,BOSTON,"One fine summer afternoon, when there was no school, he was walking on"
1783,BOSTON,the banks of a river that beautified the scenery of his native place. He
1784,BOSTON,"admired the silver stream as it sparkled in the sunbeams, and the rich"
1785,BOSTON,"verdure that clothed its banks. Suddenly, a large boy plunged in, as if"
1786,BOSTON,"for the purpose of bathing, though he did not divest himself of any part"
1787,BOSTON,"of his clothing. Soon, he struggled in distress, as if ready to sink."
1788,BOSTON,
1789,BOSTON,"Ralph Edward, the son of the widow, had been taught to swim. Throwing"
1790,BOSTON,"off his boots and his little coat, he hastened to the relief of the"
1791,BOSTON,"drowning stranger. He found him nearly senseless, and though much larger"
1792,BOSTON,"than himself, and nearly twice his age, succeeded by great exertions in"
1793,BOSTON,"bringing him to the shore. There, he supported him against a bank, until"
1794,BOSTON,"he had thrown from his mouth a quantity of water, and was able to thank"
1795,BOSTON,his benefactor. He confessed that he was ignorant of the art of
1796,BOSTON,"swimming, but had a great desire to learn, and had no idea that the"
1797,BOSTON,"river was so deep and swift. When he was able to proceed on his way,"
1798,BOSTON,"Ralph Edward returned home. His head was giddy, and his breast throbbed"
1799,BOSTON,"with the efforts he had made He went to his little chamber, and throwing"
1800,BOSTON,"himself upon the bed, wept bitterly. His mother heard him moaning, and"
1801,BOSTON,inquired the cause of his grief. He told her he could not forget the
1802,BOSTON,"convulsed features of a half-drowned boy, and the pain he seemed to feel"
1803,BOSTON,"when he gasped for breath upon the bank. Then, in compliance with her"
1804,BOSTON,"request, he related all the circumstances."
1805,BOSTON,
1806,BOSTON,"""My son, do you know that you have been in great danger? Have you never"
1807,BOSTON,"heard that the grasp of drowning persons is fatal?"""
1808,BOSTON,

1811,BOSTON,
1812,BOSTON,"""Was he your friend?"""
1813,BOSTON,
1814,BOSTON,"""I do not even know his name. I think he is a servant in some family not"
1815,BOSTON,"far off. I have seen him driving a cow to pasture, but never spoke to"
1816,BOSTON,"him until to-day."""
1817,BOSTON,
1818,BOSTON,"""How were you able to swim, and support a boy so much larger than"
1819,BOSTON,"yourself?"""
1820,BOSTON,
1821,BOSTON,"""Mother, I cannot say. I only know that I remember what you told us to"

1824,BOSTON,
1825,BOSTON,"The mother comforted her child, and soothed his agitated nerves, and"
1826,BOSTON,gave him her blessing. After that he slept sweetly and awoke refreshed.
1827,BOSTON,"Trembling at the risk he had run, she still was thankful for the spirit"
1828,BOSTON,"that had moved him to do good to a stranger, and the piety that had made"
1829,BOSTON,him mindful of the great Giver of strength and Hearer of prayer.
1830,BOSTON,
1831,BOSTON,"She reflected with gratitude also, upon his humility. He did not say"
1832,BOSTON,"boastfully, ""I have rescued a boy from the river, when he was ready to"
1833,BOSTON,"sink. He was larger than I, but I did it all alone. He is almost twice"
1834,BOSTON,"as old too, and does not even know how to keep himself up in the water,"
1835,BOSTON,"while I can swim as well and boldly as a man."""
1836,BOSTON,
1837,BOSTON,"No. He came home without alluding to the occurrence, as if it were a"
1838,BOSTON,"matter of course, to help those who were in need. He complained not of"
1839,BOSTON,"fatigue, though every nerve was strained and tremulous. He went silently"
1840,BOSTON,"to his own secluded room, and shed tears of pity at the remembrance of"
1841,BOSTON,the struggles of the sufferer. The true greatness that prompted this
1842,BOSTON,"forgetfulness of self, was as remarkable as the courage that snatched a"

1879,BOSTON,"It is doubtless known to my readers, that the Huguenots were French"
1880,BOSTON,"Protestants, who on account of religious persecution fled from their"
1881,BOSTON,"country. The Edict of Nantz was a law made by Henry IV. of France,"
1882,BOSTON,"allowing liberty of conscience, and safety to those who dissented from"
1883,BOSTON,"the faith of the Church of Rome, the established religion of the realm."
1884,BOSTON,"This edict was repealed by Louis XIV. in 1685; and the Protestants, or"
1885,BOSTON,"Huguenots, as they were generally called, left their country in great"
1886,BOSTON,numbers and sought refuge in foreign lands. Thousands found a peaceful
1887,BOSTON,"home in this western world, and their descendants are among the most"

1889,BOSTON,
1890,BOSTON,"Once, on a cold wintry evening, somewhat more than a century since, a"

1893,BOSTON,"Within, by a blazing hearth, a group of children gathered around their"

1907,BOSTON,"she granted my request. My brothers and sisters loved and respected her,"
1908,BOSTON,as a being of a superior order. Her memory of early scenes was clear and
1909,BOSTON,"vivid, even in extreme age, when passing events made but a slight"

1921,BOSTON,"remember to have seen in history, was son-in-law to the great Admiral"
1922,BOSTON,Coligny. They were summoned to attend and take part in the public
1923,BOSTON,demonstrations of joy which marked the nuptials of young Henry of
1924,BOSTON,"Navarre, and the princess Margaret. This was in the spring of 1572. The"
1925,BOSTON,"Queen of Navarre, with her son and suite, had just arrived, and were"
1926,BOSTON,received with great pomp and festivity. Charles IX. was at that time
1927,BOSTON,"king of France. He was a treacherous, vacillating character, and ruled"
1928,BOSTON,"by his mother, Catharine de Medicis, who was far more wicked than"
1929,BOSTON,"himself. To further her own plots, she induced him to treat the"
1930,BOSTON,Protestant noblemen with marked attention. He complimented the manly
1931,BOSTON,"beauty of De Teligny, the dignified deportment of the Baron de Rosny,"
1932,BOSTON,and the philosophy of the Count de la Rochefaucault. He was fond of
1933,BOSTON,"being seen walking arm in arm with the great Admiral Coligny, whom he"

1937,BOSTON,
1938,BOSTON,"His whole life was marked by decided and habitual piety. Prayers, and"

1940,BOSTON,"The officers both of France and Germany, who often surrounded his"
1941,BOSTON,"hospitable table, were the witnesses of his humble devotion. For as soon"
1942,BOSTON,"as the cloth was removed, he rose up, with all who were present, and if"
1943,BOSTON,"there was no minister there, rendered himself, earnest thanks to"
1944,BOSTON,Almighty God. The sacred worship which he enjoyed in the quiet of his
1945,BOSTON,"family, he endeavoured as far as possible to establish in the camp and"
1946,BOSTON,in the army.
1947,BOSTON,
1948,BOSTON,Many of the French nobles followed under their own roofs the religious

1956,BOSTON,
1957,BOSTON,"""Yes, and distinguished by the most devoted piety. She had not been long"
1958,BOSTON,"in Paris, ere she was seized with mortal sickness. Some suspected it to"
1959,BOSTON,"be the effect of poison, administered by Catharine, that this formidable"
1960,BOSTON,"protector of the Protestants might be out of the way, ere her plot to"
1961,BOSTON,destroy them was hazarded. When the Queen of Navarre saw that her end
1962,BOSTON,"drew nigh, she called her son to her bedside, and charged him solemnly"
1963,BOSTON,"to maintain the true religion, to take a tender care of the education of"
1964,BOSTON,"his sister, to avoid the society of vicious persons, and not to suffer"
1965,BOSTON,"his soul to be diverted from duty, by the empty pleasures of the world."

1976,BOSTON,was appointed for the nuptial ceremony. An ample pavilion was erected
1977,BOSTON,opposite to the great church of Notre Dame. It was magnificently covered
1978,BOSTON,"with cloth of gold. The concourse of spectators was immense, and their"
1979,BOSTON,"shouts seemed to rend the sky, as the youthful pair appeared in their"
1980,BOSTON,"royal garments. When Henry, bowing almost to the feet of his beautiful"
1981,BOSTON,"bride, took from his brow the coronet of Navarre, the ladies admired his"
1982,BOSTON,"gracefulness, and the freshness of his auburn hair, which inclining to"
1983,BOSTON,"red, curled richly around his noble forehead. The princess had a highly"
1984,BOSTON,"brilliant complexion, and was decorated with a profusion of splendid"
1985,BOSTON,jewels.
1986,BOSTON,
1987,BOSTON,The Cardinal of Bourbon received their vows. There seemed some degree of
1988,BOSTON,displeasure to curl his haughty lip. Probably he was dissatisfied that
1989,BOSTON,all the ceremonies of the Romish church were not observed. For as the
1990,BOSTON,"prince was a Protestant, and the princess Catholic, the solemnities were"
1991,BOSTON,"of a mixed nature, accommodated to both. It had been settled in the"
1992,BOSTON,"marriage contract, that neither party should interfere with the other,"
1993,BOSTON,in the exercise of their different religions. To give public proof of
1994,BOSTON,"this, as soon as the nuptial ceremony was performed, the bride left the"
1995,BOSTON,"pavilion to attend mass, and the bridegroom to hear the sermon of a"
1996,BOSTON,Protestant divine. Acclamations and music from countless instruments
1997,BOSTON,"loudly resounded, when the royal couple again appeared, and proceeded"
1998,BOSTON,together to the magnificent bridal banquet. Charles presented his sister
1999,BOSTON,"with 100,000 crowns for her dower, and in the festivities which"

2005,BOSTON,
2006,BOSTON,"""Less than a week intervened. The ringing of the bells for morning"
2007,BOSTON,"prayers, at three o'clock, on Sunday, August 24th, was the signal for"
2008,BOSTON,the Catholics to rush forth and murder the Protestants. The holy Sabbath
2009,BOSTON,"dawned in peace. The matin-bell, calling the devout to worship a God of"
2010,BOSTON,"mercy, was heard. Man came forth to shed the blood of his unsuspecting"
2011,BOSTON,"brother. The work of destruction began in many parts of the city, at the"
2012,BOSTON,"same moment. Tumult and shrieks and uproar increased, until they"
2013,BOSTON,deepened into a terrible and universal groan. The streets were filled
2014,BOSTON,"with infuriated soldiers, and almost every habitation of the Huguenots"
2015,BOSTON,"became a slaughter-house. Infants were transfixed on pikes, and women"
2016,BOSTON,"precipitated themselves from high windows and battlements, that they"
2017,BOSTON,might die without outrage. Thirty thousand fell victims in this horrible
2018,BOSTON,"massacre, which extending itself from Paris to the provinces, was not"
2019,BOSTON,"satiated until more than twice that number had been sacrificed."""

2022,BOSTON,
2023,BOSTON,"""At the commencement of the tumult, his father hastily armed himself,"
2024,BOSTON,"and supposing it some temporary disturbance, went forth to aid in"
2025,BOSTON,"quelling it, commanding him to remain in the house. He obeyed until he"
2026,BOSTON,"was no longer able to endure the tortures of suspense, and then rushed"
2027,BOSTON,out in search of a father whom he was never more to behold. Hasting to
2028,BOSTON,"the quarters of Lord Teligny, his friend and benefactor, he found him"
2029,BOSTON,"mortally wounded, and faintly repeating the names of his wife and"
2030,BOSTON,"children. He then flew to the Hotel de St. Pierre, where Admiral Coligny"
2031,BOSTON,"lodged. But his headless trunk was precipitated from the window, and"
2032,BOSTON,"dragged onward by blood-smeared men, with faces scarcely human."
2033,BOSTON,
2034,BOSTON,"He had been wounded previous to the massacre. On Friday, the 22nd, he"
2035,BOSTON,"was coming from the Louvre, with a group of noblemen. He walked slowly,"
2036,BOSTON,reading a petition which had been presented him. As he passed the
2037,BOSTON,"cloister of St. Germain, he was shot by an arquebus loaded with three"
2038,BOSTON,"balls. His left arm was deeply wounded, and the fore-finger of his right"
2039,BOSTON,"hand carried away. No trace of the assassin, who had been employed by"
2040,BOSTON,"the Duke of Guise, could be found, though the friends of the Admiral"
2041,BOSTON,made persevering search.
2042,BOSTON,
2043,BOSTON,As the surgeon on examination feared that the copper balls were
2044,BOSTON,"poisoned, this illustrious man supposed that his hour had come, and"
2045,BOSTON,"turning to his lamenting friends, said,"
2046,BOSTON,
2047,BOSTON,"""Why do you weep? For myself, I am honoured to receive these wounds, for"
2048,BOSTON,"the holy cause of my God. Pray him to strengthen me."""
2049,BOSTON,
2050,BOSTON,"The massacre commenced while it was yet dark, on Sunday morning, and the"
2051,BOSTON,"Duke of Guise, dreading lest Coligny, notwithstanding his injuries,"
2052,BOSTON,"should escape, and by his courage and influence reanimate the"
2053,BOSTON,"Protestants, hastened to his lodgings with three hundred soldiers."
2054,BOSTON,"Knocking at the outer gate, they demanded admission in the name of the"
2055,BOSTON,"king. The gentleman who opened it, fell, stabbed to the heart."
2056,BOSTON,
2057,BOSTON,"The wounded Admiral, in his apartment, was engaged in prayer with a"
2058,BOSTON,"minister who attended him. A terrified servant rushed in, exclaiming,"
2059,BOSTON,
2060,BOSTON,"""My Lord, the inner gate is forced. We have no means of resisting."""
2061,BOSTON,
2062,BOSTON,"""It is long since,"" replied Coligny, calmly, ""that I prepared myself to"
2063,BOSTON,"die. Save yourselves all who can. Me, you cannot defend. I commend my"
2064,BOSTON,"soul to the mercy of God."""
2065,BOSTON,
2066,BOSTON,"He arose from his bed, and being unable to stand upright, on account of"
2067,BOSTON,"his wounds, supported himself with his back against the wall. The first"
2068,BOSTON,"who burst into his chamber was a grim German, servant to the Duke of"
2069,BOSTON,Guise.
2070,BOSTON,
2071,BOSTON,"""Are you the Admiral?"""
2072,BOSTON,
2073,BOSTON,"""Yes. I am he."""
2074,BOSTON,
2075,BOSTON,"And the illustrious man, fixing his eyes without emotion on the naked"
2076,BOSTON,"sword of his murderer, said, with the dignity of a Christian,"
2077,BOSTON,
2078,BOSTON,"""Young man! you ought to respect my age and infirmities."""
2079,BOSTON,
2080,BOSTON,The answer of the assassin was to plunge his weapon deep in that noble
2081,BOSTON,"bosom. The Duke of Guise traversed the court below, with breathless"
2082,BOSTON,"impatience. To his fierce spirit, every moment seemed an age."
2083,BOSTON,
2084,BOSTON,"""Is the work done?"" he asked."
2085,BOSTON,
2086,BOSTON,"""It is finished, my Lord!"""
2087,BOSTON,
2088,BOSTON,"He demanded to see it, with his own eyes. They raised the body of the"
2089,BOSTON,"Admiral to cast it down to him. Still faintly respiring, it seemed to"
2090,BOSTON,cling to the casement.
2091,BOSTON,
2092,BOSTON,"At length, the ruthless murderers precipitated it into the court-yard."
2093,BOSTON,"Guise wiped with his handkerchief the face suffused with blood, and"
2094,BOSTON,"gazing intensely upon it by the flaring lamps, exclaimed,"
2095,BOSTON,
2096,BOSTON,"""It is the man."""
2097,BOSTON,
2098,BOSTON,"Rushing into the streets, he bade, with hoarse cries, the work of death"
2099,BOSTON,"to proceed, in the name of the king."
2100,BOSTON,
2101,BOSTON,While our ancestor was hurrying in amazement and terror from place to
2102,BOSTON,"place, he met a boy of nearly his own age, whose placid countenance and"
2103,BOSTON,unmoved deportment strongly contrasted with the surrounding horrors. Two
2104,BOSTON,"soldiers apparently had him in charge, shouting ""_To mass! to mass!_"""
2105,BOSTON,"while he, neither in compliance nor opposition, calmly continued his"
2106,BOSTON,"course, until they found some more conspicuous object of barbarity, and"
2107,BOSTON,"released him from their grasp. This proved to be Maximilian Bethune,"
2108,BOSTON,"afterwards the great Duke of Sully, prime minister of Henry IV., who by"
2109,BOSTON,"a wonderful mixture of prudence and firmness, preserved a life which was"
2110,BOSTON,to be of such value to the realm. He was at this time making his way
2111,BOSTON,"through the infuriated mob, to the College of Burgundy, where in the"
2112,BOSTON,"friendship of its principal, La Faye, he found protection and safety."""
2113,BOSTON,
2114,BOSTON,"""Please not to forget what befell our relative."""
2115,BOSTON,
2116,BOSTON,It was in vain that he attempted to imitate this example of
2117,BOSTON,"self-command. Distracted with fear for his father, he searched for him"
2118,BOSTON,"in scenes of the utmost danger, wildly repeating his name. A soldier"
2119,BOSTON,"raised over his head a sword dripping with blood. Ere it fell, a man in"
2120,BOSTON,"a black habit took his arm through his, and with some exertion of"
2121,BOSTON,"strength led him onward. They entered less populous streets, where"
2122,BOSTON,"carnage seemed not to have extended, before he perfectly recovered his"
2123,BOSTON,"recollection. Then he would have disengaged himself, but his arm was"
2124,BOSTON,"detained, as strongly as if it were pinioned. ""Let me seek my father!"""
2125,BOSTON,"he exclaimed. ""Be silent!"" said his conductor, with a voice of power"
2126,BOSTON,that made him tremble. At length he knocked at the massive gate of a
2127,BOSTON,"monastery. The porter admitted them, and they passed to an inner cell."
2128,BOSTON,"Affected by his passionate bursts of grief, and exclamations of 'Father,"
2129,BOSTON,"dear father!' his protector said, 'Thank God, my son, that thy own life"
2130,BOSTON,"is saved. I ventured forth amid scenes of horror, hoping to bring to"
2131,BOSTON,"this refuge a brother, whom I loved as my own soul. I found him lifeless"
2132,BOSTON,"and mangled. Thou wert near, and methought thou didst resemble him. Thy"
2133,BOSTON,"voice had his very tone, as it cried, 'Father, father!' My heart yearned"
2134,BOSTON,to be as a father to thee. And I have led thee hither through blood and
2135,BOSTON,"death. Poor child, be comforted, and lift up thy soul to God.'"""
2136,BOSTON,
2137,BOSTON,"""Was it not very strange, that a Catholic should be so good?"""
2138,BOSTON,
2139,BOSTON,"""There are good men among every sect of Christians, my child. We should"
2140,BOSTON,"never condemn those who differ from us in opinion, if their lives are"
2141,BOSTON,according to the Gospel. This ecclesiastic was a man of true
2142,BOSTON,benevolence. Nothing could exceed his kindness to him whose life he had
2143,BOSTON,"saved. It was ascertained that he was not only fatherless but an orphan,"
2144,BOSTON,"for the work of destruction, extending itself into many parts of the"
2145,BOSTON,"kingdom, involved his family in its wreck. The greatest attention was"
2146,BOSTON,"paid to his education, and his patron instructed him in the sciences,"
2147,BOSTON,and particularly from the study of history he taught him the emptiness
2148,BOSTON,"of glory without virtue, and the changeful nature of earthly good. He"
2149,BOSTON,"made him the companion of his walks, and by the innocent and beautiful"
2150,BOSTON,"things of nature, sought to win him from that melancholy which is so"
2151,BOSTON,"corrosive to intellect, and so fatal to peace. He permitted him to take"
2152,BOSTON,"part in his works of charity, and to stand with him by the beds of the"
2153,BOSTON,"sick and dying, that he might witness the power of that piety which"
2154,BOSTON,upholds when flesh and heart fainteth.
2155,BOSTON,
2156,BOSTON,"During his residence here, the death of Charles IX. took place. He was a"
2157,BOSTON,king in whom his people and even his nearest friends had no confidence.
2158,BOSTON,"After the savage massacre of St. Bartholomew, which was conducted under"
2159,BOSTON,"his auspices, he had neither satisfaction nor repose. He had always a"
2160,BOSTON,"flush and fierceness upon his countenance, which it had never before"
2161,BOSTON,"worn. Conscience haunted him with a sense of guilt, and he could obtain"
2162,BOSTON,no quiet sleep. He seemed to be surrounded by vague and nameless
2163,BOSTON,"terrors. He fancied that he heard groans in the air, and suffered a"
2164,BOSTON,strange sickness which forced blood from all the pores of his body.
2165,BOSTON,
2166,BOSTON,"He was attended in his illness by a faithful old nurse, to whom,"
2167,BOSTON,"notwithstanding she was a Huguenot, he affectionately trusted. One who"
2168,BOSTON,"has described the close of his life, says, that two nights before his"
2169,BOSTON,"death, she was sitting near him on a chest, almost overcome with the"
2170,BOSTON,drowsiness of fatigue. She was aroused by hearing the king bitterly moan
2171,BOSTON,"and weep. As she softly approached his bed, he exclaimed, through sighs"
2172,BOSTON,"and sobs, so interrupting his voice that it was difficult to understand"
2173,BOSTON,"him,"
2174,BOSTON,
2175,BOSTON,"""Ah! my nurse, my dear nurse, what blood! what murders! Alas! what evil"
2176,BOSTON,"counsels have I followed! Oh my God! pardon me! and have mercy on me, if"
2177,BOSTON,"thou canst. What shall I do? I am lost! I see it but too well."""
2178,BOSTON,
2179,BOSTON,The pitying nurse answered with tears.
2180,BOSTON,
2181,BOSTON,"""Sire! let the guilt rest on those who counselled you to it. For if you"
2182,BOSTON,"consented not in your heart to those murders, and are repentant, trust"
2183,BOSTON,"that God will not charge them to you, but will cover them with the"
2184,BOSTON,"mantle of his Son's great love, to whom alone you should turn."""
2185,BOSTON,
2186,BOSTON,"He listened mournfully to her words, and taking from her hand a"
2187,BOSTON,"handkerchief, his own being saturated with tears, gave a sign that she"
2188,BOSTON,"should retire, and take a little rest."
2189,BOSTON,
2190,BOSTON,His attachment to this pious nurse was strongly contrasted with his
2191,BOSTON,shrinking aversion whenever his mother approached him. He viewed her as
2192,BOSTON,"the instigator to that horrible massacre which troubled his conscience,"
2193,BOSTON,and her presence greatly distressed him. This miserable monarch died on
2194,BOSTON,"the 30th of May, 1574, at the age of 23, having sinned much and suffered"
2195,BOSTON,"much, though his years were few."
2196,BOSTON,
2197,BOSTON,"He was succeeded by his brother Henry III., against whom, and Catharine,"
2198,BOSTON,"the Queen-mother, three powerful armies were opposed, one led by the"
2199,BOSTON,"King of Navarre, one by the Prince of CondÃ©, and the other by the Duke"
2200,BOSTON,of Anjou. The tidings of these civil wars penetrated into the seclusion
2201,BOSTON,of the religious house where my grandfather had already passed three
2202,BOSTON,years in quiet study. They kept alive the martial spirit which he
2203,BOSTON,"inherited, and quickened his desire to partake in their tumultuous"
2204,BOSTON,scenes. At length he communicated to his patron his discontentment with
2205,BOSTON,"a life of inaction, and his irrepressible wish to mingle again with the"
2206,BOSTON,"world. Unusual paleness settled on the brow of the venerable man, as he"
2207,BOSTON,"replied,"
2208,BOSTON,
2209,BOSTON,"""I have long seen that thy heart was not in these quiet shades, and I"
2210,BOSTON,have lamented it. Yet thus it is with the young: they will not be wise
2211,BOSTON,"from the experience of others. They must feel with their own feet, the"
2212,BOSTON,"thorns in the path of pleasure. They must grasp with their own hand, the"
2213,BOSTON,sharp briers that cling around the objects of their ambition. They must
2214,BOSTON,"come trusting to the world's broken cisterns, find the dregs from her"
2215,BOSTON,"cup cleaving in bitterness to their lip, and feel her in their bosom,"
2216,BOSTON,"ere they will believe."""
2217,BOSTON,
2218,BOSTON,The youth enlarged with emotion on his gratitude to his benefactor. He
2219,BOSTON,"mentioned the efforts he had made to comply with his desires, and lead a"
2220,BOSTON,"life of contemplative piety, but that these efforts were overpowered by"
2221,BOSTON,"an impulse to mingle in more active pursuits, and to visit the home of"
2222,BOSTON,his ancestors.
2223,BOSTON,
2224,BOSTON,"""Go, then, my son, and still the wild throbbings of thy heart over the"
2225,BOSTON,silent beds of those who wake no more till the resurrection morn. Think
2226,BOSTON,"not that I have read thy nature slightly, or with a careless glance. The"
2227,BOSTON,spirit of a warrior slumbers there. Thou dost long to mix in the battle.
2228,BOSTON,"I have marked, in thy musings, the lightning of thine eye shoot forth,"
2229,BOSTON,as if thou hadst forgotten Him who said: 'Vengeance is mine.' Would that
2230,BOSTON,"thou hadst loved peace. Go; yet remember, that 'he who taketh the sword"
2231,BOSTON,"shall perish by the sword.' As for me, my path on earth is short, or I"
2232,BOSTON,should more deeply mourn thy departure. Thou hast been but too dear to
2233,BOSTON,"me; and when thou art gone, my spirit shall cast from its wings the last"
2234,BOSTON,"cumbrance of earthly love."""
2235,BOSTON,
2236,BOSTON,"He gave him his benediction with great tenderness and solemnity, and the"
2237,BOSTON,parting was tearful and affectionate. But the young traveller soon
2238,BOSTON,"dismissed his sorrow, for the cheering influence of the charms of"
2239,BOSTON,"nature, and the gladness of liberty."
2240,BOSTON,
2241,BOSTON,The genial season of spring diffused universal beauty. The vales spread
2242,BOSTON,"out their green mantles to catch the showers of blossoms, with which"
2243,BOSTON,every breeze covered them. Luxuriant vines lifted up their fragrant
2244,BOSTON,coronets. Young lambs playfully cropped the tender leaves. Quiet kids
2245,BOSTON,stood ruminating by the clear streams. Music was in all the branches.
2246,BOSTON,"The father-bird cheered his companion, who, patient on her nest, brooded"
2247,BOSTON,their future hopes.
2248,BOSTON,
2249,BOSTON,"""Surely,"" thought he, ""the peasant is the most happy of men, dwelling in"
2250,BOSTON,"the midst of the innocence and beauty of creation."""
2251,BOSTON,
2252,BOSTON,"Then, with the inconsistency natural to youth, he would extol the life"
2253,BOSTON,"of the soldier, its energy, hardihood, and contempt of danger;"
2254,BOSTON,"forgetting that, in this preference of war, he was applauding the"
2255,BOSTON,science of all others the most hostile to nature and to man.
2256,BOSTON,
2257,BOSTON,In the midst of such reflections he reached the spot of his nativity.
2258,BOSTON,"The home of his ancestors was in the possession of others, a new and"
2259,BOSTON,"lordly race. Strange eyes looked upon him, where the voice of his"
2260,BOSTON,parents was wont to welcome his returning steps with delight. He could
2261,BOSTON,"not endure the grief in which none participated, and this solitude among"
2262,BOSTON,scenes which his childhood loved. He sought to shake off at once his
2263,BOSTON,"sorrow and his loneliness, and enlisted as a volunteer in the Protestant"
2264,BOSTON,army. He flattered himself that religion dictated the measure: yet
2265,BOSTON,"sometimes, in a sleepless hour, the monition of his distant benefactor"
2266,BOSTON,"would come mournfully, ""He that taketh the sword shall perish by the"
2267,BOSTON,"sword."" His first exploit in arms was at the siege of Ville-Franche, in"
2268,BOSTON,"Perigord, in the year 1576. He continued to follow the fortunes of the"
2269,BOSTON,"King of Navarre, and to endure without shrinking the dangers and"
2270,BOSTON,"privations of a soldier, with scarcely any intervals of peaceful life,"
2271,BOSTON,"until the battle of Coutras, where he fell, covered with wounds. This"
2272,BOSTON,"severe combat took place on the morning of October 20th, 1587. There,"
2273,BOSTON,"the King of Navarre, who, you remember, was afterwards Henry the Great,"
2274,BOSTON,"of France, distinguished himself by a daring courage. He first forced"
2275,BOSTON,the ranks of the enemy. He seized several prisoners with his own hand.
2276,BOSTON,"Conspicuous by the plume of white feathers in his lofty helmet, he was"
2277,BOSTON,"continually singled out as a mark, and yet escaped uninjured. Perceiving"
2278,BOSTON,"the Prince of CondÃ© and the Count de Soissons, in the most exposed parts"
2279,BOSTON,"of the field, he exclaimed, 'All that I shall say to you, is, that you"
2280,BOSTON,"are of the house of Bourbon, and please God, I will show you that I am"
2281,BOSTON,your elder brother.' The victory of the Protestants was complete. The
2282,BOSTON,"contest lasted scarcely an hour, yet 5000 of their opponents were left"
2283,BOSTON,"dead upon the field. They were led on by the Duke de Joyeuse, who with"
2284,BOSTON,"his haughty brother, St. Sauveur, were drawn lifeless from among heaps"
2285,BOSTON,"of slain, their brows still fierce and frowning, as if they hated that"
2286,BOSTON,death which could thus level all distinctions. I have mentioned that our
2287,BOSTON,"ancestor fell in this engagement. He was not thirty years old, and left"
2288,BOSTON,"a wife and infant son, to mourn his untimely departure."""
2289,BOSTON,
2290,BOSTON,"""Is it then from our grandmother that you learned all the circumstances"
2291,BOSTON,"of his story?"""
2292,BOSTON,
2293,BOSTON,"""All these and many more. She was never weary of relating the changes of"
2294,BOSTON,"his life, and the sorrows of her early widowhood. Deeply did she impress"
2295,BOSTON,"on the mind of her son, and of his offspring, the evils of war, and the"
2296,BOSTON,"blessings of peaceful Christianity. Under his roof she dwelt, cherished"
2297,BOSTON,"and venerated, till the children of the third generation rose up to call"
2298,BOSTON,her blessed. Never shall I forget with what emotions of grief and
2299,BOSTON,"reverence he laid his hand upon her dying eyes, and wept at her tomb."
2300,BOSTON,The piety and love of peace which she had early instilled into his
2301,BOSTON,"heart, rendered his home the abode of tranquillity, and domestic"
2302,BOSTON,"happiness. His industry, and correct judgment restored competence to a"
2303,BOSTON,"family, which the desolations of war had impoverished, and almost"
2304,BOSTON,"annihilated. Our paternal residence, even now, seems to rise up before"
2305,BOSTON,"me, visible and distinct, as in a picture. Uniting simplicity with"
2306,BOSTON,"comfort, it stood on a gentle slope of ground. In front, a row of"
2307,BOSTON,chestnuts reared a canopy of lofty shade. Here the traveller sometimes
2308,BOSTON,"rested, refreshing himself with the water of a little fountain, which,"
2309,BOSTON,"clear as crystal, oozed into a rustic limestone reservoir. In the rear"
2310,BOSTON,"of our residence, rose a hill where our goats found herbage. There they"
2311,BOSTON,"might sometimes be seen, maintaining so slight a footing on projecting"
2312,BOSTON,"cliffs, that they seemed to hang suspended by the mouth from the slight"
2313,BOSTON,"branch they were cropping. The tall poplars, which were interspersed"
2314,BOSTON,"among the foliage, conveyed to us the pensive murmur of approaching"
2315,BOSTON,"storms, and around their trunks, mossy seats were constructed, where we"
2316,BOSTON,"sometimes sat, watching the chequered rays of the moon, and singing our"
2317,BOSTON,"simple provincial melodies. Stretching at the foot of this hill, was the"
2318,BOSTON,small domain whence we drew our subsistence. Diligence and economy made
2319,BOSTON,"it fully equal to our wants, and to the claims of charity. Over the"
2320,BOSTON,"roots of the filbert, fig, and mulberry, crept the prolific melon. The"
2321,BOSTON,"gourd, supporting itself by their trunks, lifted its yellow globes into"
2322,BOSTON,"the air like orbs of gold, while still higher rose the aspiring vine,"
2323,BOSTON,filling its glowing clusters for the wine-press. Our fields of wheat
2324,BOSTON,"gave us bread, and the bearded oat rewarded the faithful animal that"
2325,BOSTON,"gathered in our harvest. Bees, hastening with busy hum to their"
2326,BOSTON,"sheltered cells, provided the luxury of our evening repast. The olive"
2327,BOSTON,"yielded us its treasures, and furnished an emblem of the peace that"
2328,BOSTON,"pervaded our abode. A genial soil made our labours light, and correct"
2329,BOSTON,principles converted those labours into happiness. Our parents early
2330,BOSTON,"taught their large family of twelve children, that indolence was but"
2331,BOSTON,"another name for vice and disgrace; that he, who for his subsistence"
2332,BOSTON,"rendered no return of usefulness, was unjust to society, and disobedient"
2333,BOSTON,to God. So our industry commenced in infancy. In our hive there were no
2334,BOSTON,drones. We early began to look with pity on those whose parents
2335,BOSTON,neglected to teach them that well-directed industry was bliss. Among us
2336,BOSTON,"there were no servants. With the first beams of morning, the band of"
2337,BOSTON,brothers were seen cheerfully entering on their allotted employments.
2338,BOSTON,"Some broke the surface of the earth, others strowed seeds or kernels of"
2339,BOSTON,"fruits, others removed the weeds which threatened to impede the harvest."
2340,BOSTON,"By the same hands was our vintage tended, and our grain gathered into"
2341,BOSTON,"the garner. Our sisters wrought the flax which we cultivated, and"
2342,BOSTON,changed the fleece of our flocks into a wardrobe for winter. They
2343,BOSTON,"refreshed us after our toil with cakes flavoured with honey, and with"
2344,BOSTON,"cheeses, rivalling in delicacy those of Parma. They arranged in tasteful"
2345,BOSTON,"baskets of their own construction, fresh fruits or aromatic herbs, or"
2346,BOSTON,rich flowers for the market. They delighted sometimes to mingle in our
2347,BOSTON,severer labours; and when we saw the unwonted exertion heightening the
2348,BOSTON,"bloom of their cheeks, or placed in their hair the half-blown wild rose,"
2349,BOSTON,"to us, who had seen nothing more fair, they were perfect in grace and"
2350,BOSTON,"beauty. Sometimes at twilight, or beneath the soft evening air of"
2351,BOSTON,"summer, we mingled in the dance, to the music of our flute and viol. Our"
2352,BOSTON,"parents and our grandmother seated near, enjoyed the pastime, and spoke"
2353,BOSTON,"of their own youth, and of the goodness of the Almighty Sire. Often,"
2354,BOSTON,"assembled in our pleasant parlour, each read in turn to the listening"
2355,BOSTON,"auditory, histories of what man has been, or fictitious representations"
2356,BOSTON,"of what he might be, from the pages of the moral painter or the poet."
2357,BOSTON,"The younger ones received regular lessons in the rudiments of education,"
2358,BOSTON,"and the elder ones, in succession, devoted a stated portion of each day"
2359,BOSTON,"to the pursuit of higher studies, under the direction of their parents."
2360,BOSTON,"When the family circle convened in the evening, he was the happiest who"
2361,BOSTON,could bring the greatest amount of useful and interesting information to
2362,BOSTON,"the general stock. The acquisition of knowledge, which to indolent minds"
2363,BOSTON,"is so irksome, was to us a delightful recreation from severer labours."
2364,BOSTON,"The exercise which gave us physical vigour, seemed also to impart"
2365,BOSTON,intellectual energy. The application to which we were inured gave us the
2366,BOSTON,"more entire control of our mental powers, while the almost unvaried"
2367,BOSTON,"health that we enjoyed preserved elasticity of spirits, and made all our"
2368,BOSTON,"pleasures more sweet. Such was our mode of life, that we were almost"
2369,BOSTON,insensible to inconvenience from the slight changes of the seasons. In
2370,BOSTON,"any temporary indisposition or casualty, our mother was our ministering"
2371,BOSTON,"angel. Her acquaintance with the powers of the medicinal plants, that"
2372,BOSTON,"filled her favourite part of the garden, and still more, her intimate"
2373,BOSTON,"knowledge of the little diversities in our constitutions, usually"
2374,BOSTON,produced a favourable result. She also perfectly understood the slight
2375,BOSTON,"shades in our disposition and character, and by thus tracing the springs"
2376,BOSTON,"of action to their minuter sources, advanced with more certainty to the"
2377,BOSTON,"good ends of education. Mingled with her love, was a dignity, a decision"
2378,BOSTON,"that commanded our respect. Without this, the parental relation loses"
2379,BOSTON,"its influence, and sacrifices that attribute of authority with which it"
2380,BOSTON,was invested by the Eternal. Piety was taught us by the example of our
2381,BOSTON,parents. We were early led to consider the morning and evening orison
2382,BOSTON,"and the Sabbath, as periods in which we were invited to mingle our"
2383,BOSTON,thoughts with angels; and that he who was negligent or indifferent to
2384,BOSTON,"them, forfeited one of the highest privileges of his nature."
2385,BOSTON,
2386,BOSTON,Thus happy was our domestic government. It mingled the pastoral and
2387,BOSTON,patriarchal features. I have never seen any system more favourable to
2388,BOSTON,"individual improvement, and the order, harmony, and prosperity of the"
2389,BOSTON,whole.
2390,BOSTON,
2391,BOSTON,"But I am forgetting, dear child, that you must be wearied with my"
2392,BOSTON,wandering tale and numerous reflections. It is so pleasant to recall the
2393,BOSTON,"days of childhood, and the images of my parents and brothers and"
2394,BOSTON,"sisters, that I may have taken an old man's privilege too freely, and"
2395,BOSTON,"talked beyond your patience."""
2396,BOSTON,
2397,BOSTON,"""How much I am indebted to you, my dear grandfather, for your kind"
2398,BOSTON,evening's entertainment. I hope I shall profit from the moral of your
2399,BOSTON,"story, as well as from the pleasure of listening to it. I trust I shall"
2400,BOSTON,"learn to love peace, and industry, and piety."""
2401,BOSTON,
2402,BOSTON,"""Strive to do so, my dear boy, and ask God's help, and you will be sure"
2403,BOSTON,"to be happy. Obey your parents, and respect all who are wiser and better"
2404,BOSTON,"than yourself, whether rich or poor. This will lay the foundation of"
2405,BOSTON,"that virtue and subordination to the laws of the land, which make a good"
2406,BOSTON,citizen.
2407,BOSTON,
2408,BOSTON,"Should you live to be old, like me, you will view objects differently"
2409,BOSTON,"from what you do now. You will stand upon an isthmus, between the"
2410,BOSTON,"_things that have been, and the things that are_. On one hand, will come"
2411,BOSTON,"up the waves of memory, bold and strong; on the other, the little"
2412,BOSTON,"billows of hope, like such bubbles as children play with. Experience"
2413,BOSTON,"will be there, gathering riches even from rocks and quicksands. Then,"
2414,BOSTON,"when you look back, like me, and find your dear parents gone, you will"
2415,BOSTON,"wish that you might for one moment recall them from the grave, to render"
2416,BOSTON,"them your undying offering of gratitude, not for that indulgence which"
2417,BOSTON,"blinded their eye to your faults, and gave you the weak gratification of"
2418,BOSTON,"an hour, perhaps, at the expense of an eternity, but for that salutary"
2419,BOSTON,"discipline which uprooted error, established good habits, and taught"
2420,BOSTON,"that 'fear of God which maketh wise unto salvation.'"""

2430,BOSTON,"The self-same words that met my ear,"
2431,BOSTON,When in old times of joyous cheer
2432,BOSTON,I gladly climb'd his knee.
2433,BOSTON,
2434,BOSTON,"For oft as to his side I clung,"

2436,BOSTON,"Though to my simple mind, thy tongue"
2437,BOSTON,"Uttering ""_tick, tick_"", to old and young"
2438,BOSTON,Seem'd mystery untold.

2440,BOSTON,And still thy wondrous movements too
2441,BOSTON,"Amaz'd my gazing eye,"
2442,BOSTON,Thy hands that to their purpose true

2445,BOSTON,
2446,BOSTON,"But thou from days of toil and care,"
2447,BOSTON,"That manhood's powers employ,"
2448,BOSTON,Didst duly point him home to share

2454,BOSTON,"The downy-pinioned hours swept by,"
2455,BOSTON,"Thou, with a calm, unswerving eye"
2456,BOSTON,Didst note their numbers right.
2457,BOSTON,
2458,BOSTON,"And he, who knew so well to test"
2459,BOSTON,"Of time, the fleeting prize,"
2460,BOSTON,Did on thy meek monitions rest

2467,BOSTON,Though summon'd to a lone retreat
2468,BOSTON,His own in dust is laid.
2469,BOSTON,
2470,BOSTON,My Father's Friend! what memories bless'd
2471,BOSTON,"Thy lingering accents wake,"

2477,BOSTON,
2478,BOSTON,
2479,BOSTON,Entertaining Books.
2480,BOSTON,
2481,BOSTON,
2482,BOSTON,The age in which we live abounds with entertaining books. Stories of
2483,BOSTON,"every description, some of them containing good lessons, are exceedingly"
2484,BOSTON,numerous. Those of the better class furnish food for fancy and feeling.
2485,BOSTON,
2486,BOSTON,"Fiction has its peculiar attractions, and so has truth. Imagination can"
2487,BOSTON,"scarcely devise more strange events, more striking characters, or more"
2488,BOSTON,"romantic results, than occur on the pages of history. The entertainment"
2489,BOSTON,"derived from true books is the most valuable, because it is the most"
2490,BOSTON,worthy of being remembered. The mind rests upon it with satisfaction. It
2491,BOSTON,"accords with its native tastes. The child as soon as it can speak, says,"
2492,BOSTON,"""Please to tell me a _true_ story."" Those who are most familiar with"
2493,BOSTON,"unfolding infancy, agree, that incidents simplified from the Scriptures,"
2494,BOSTON,"delight it, though they may be frequently repeated."
2495,BOSTON,
2496,BOSTON,"So, from the great storehouse of history, the young may entertain and"
2497,BOSTON,enrich themselves at the same time. By extending their acquaintance
2498,BOSTON,"through past ages and distant nations, the powers of thought expand"
2499,BOSTON,"themselves, an acquaintance with illustrious characters is formed, and"
2500,BOSTON,"knowledge gained which will be profitable through life, both for"
2501,BOSTON,reflection and conversation.
2502,BOSTON,
2503,BOSTON,"Some have objected, that a wide range of history may give the young"
2504,BOSTON,mind a premature introduction to the vices and follies that disgrace
2505,BOSTON,"mankind. Yet thus to study them on the map of man, and to form a correct"
2506,BOSTON,"opinion of good and evil, and to deepen the love of virtue, and the"
2507,BOSTON,"hatred of vice, by the force of selected examples, might prepare the"
2508,BOSTON,"young better to understand character, and resist temptation, in the"
2509,BOSTON,actual struggle of life. The entertainments of history may be as safe as
2510,BOSTON,"those of fiction, and more salutary. If they sometimes reveal the"
2511,BOSTON,"whirlpools of ambition or the abysses of cruelty, they change the scene,"
2512,BOSTON,"and present the quiet waters of peace fertilizing the valleys, and the"
2513,BOSTON,pure rose of virtue blooming in the wilderness. Examples of true
2514,BOSTON,"greatness, generosity, and piety, if less frequent than those of an"
2515,BOSTON,"opposite nature, borrow force from contrast, and may therefore make a"
2516,BOSTON,"deeper impression, and awaken a stronger desire of imitation."
2517,BOSTON,
2518,BOSTON,The entertainments of history aid in acquiring a knowledge of human
2519,BOSTON,"nature. We there see what man has been from the beginning, and what"
2520,BOSTON,motives or temptations have moved him to good or to evil. Great care
2521,BOSTON,"should be taken to form a correct judgment, and to measure by a true"
2522,BOSTON,standard of excellence those whom the world has called illustrious.
2523,BOSTON,
2524,BOSTON,"Especially, should opinions be cautiously formed, of those whose fame"
2525,BOSTON,"rests only upon military exploits. Though the pride, cruelty, and"
2526,BOSTON,"revenge, that stain many of those whom the Old World applauded as"
2527,BOSTON,"heroes, are in a measure palliated because they were heathen, still _we_"
2528,BOSTON,"are bound to judge of right and wrong, as Christians. When we think of"
2529,BOSTON,"the misery, mourning, and death, that marked their course upon the"
2530,BOSTON,"earth, we cannot but wonder by what rule of equity, ""_one_ murder should"
2531,BOSTON,"make a _villain_, and _many, a hero_!"""
2532,BOSTON,
2533,BOSTON,"To purchase a single conquest, how many eyes have wept, how many bosoms"
2534,BOSTON,"been pierced, how many hearts broken. If victories, and triumphs, and"
2535,BOSTON,"trophies, dazzle the eye, look at their dark reverse: torrents of blood"
2536,BOSTON,"flowing, widows and orphans plunged in despair, throngs of unprepared"
2537,BOSTON,souls driven into the presence of their Maker.
2538,BOSTON,
2539,BOSTON,"The patriotism that dares danger for the preservation of liberty, the"
2540,BOSTON,"firmness that repels the encroachments of tyranny, the courage that"
2541,BOSTON,"protects those whose lives are entrusted to its care, differ from the"
2542,BOSTON,"ambition that is willing to build its glory on contention, suffering,"
2543,BOSTON,"and death. This spirit is at war with His precepts, at whose birth the"
2544,BOSTON,"harps of angels breathed the song of ""Peace on earth, and good-will to"
2545,BOSTON,"men."""
2546,BOSTON,
2547,BOSTON,History may be read by the young with a resolution of transcribing into
2548,BOSTON,"their own character, whatever it exhibits that is ""just, lovely, and of"
2549,BOSTON,"good report."" Thus will its pages not only afford rational"
2550,BOSTON,"entertainment, but be subservient to usefulness and piety in this life,"
2551,BOSTON,and to the happiness of that which is to come.

2595,BOSTON,
2596,BOSTON,
2597,BOSTON,
2598,BOSTON,Cyrus.
2599,BOSTON,
2600,BOSTON,
2601,BOSTON,Cyrus is among the most interesting characters described in ancient
2602,BOSTON,"history. He seemed fitted by nature, as well as by education, for the"
2603,BOSTON,exalted sphere that was allotted him. He is usually considered as the
2604,BOSTON,"founder of the Persian empire, and was born about 600 years before the"
2605,BOSTON,"Christian era. He was beautiful in person, and still more admirable for"
2606,BOSTON,the amiable qualities of his mind. His early training inured him to
2607,BOSTON,"study, the endurance of fatigue, and the control of his appetites and"
2608,BOSTON,"passions. In his first twelve years of life, he was said to surpass all"
2609,BOSTON,"of his own age in knowledge, and a frank, noble dignity of carriage."
2610,BOSTON,
2611,BOSTON,"At this early period, he was sent to the court of his grandfather,"
2612,BOSTON,"Astyages, the Median king, where he remained for five years. There, the"
2613,BOSTON,"temptations of luxury and self-indulgence, by which he was surrounded,"
2614,BOSTON,had no power to draw him from temperance and simplicity. He was ever
2615,BOSTON,"anxious to make peace between those who differed, and to obtain pardon"
2616,BOSTON,"for such as had offended. So gentle, generous, and beneficent was he, as"
2617,BOSTON,to become the idol of the people among whom he dwelt.
2618,BOSTON,
2619,BOSTON,"In his expedition into Assyria with his father, though still but a"
2620,BOSTON,"youth, he discovered great judgment, courage, and presence of mind."
2621,BOSTON,"Military talents and skill, were in those times held essential to every"
2622,BOSTON,"illustrious man, and these he eminently possessed. After his conquest of"
2623,BOSTON,"Babylon and marriage with a Median princess, three kingdoms were united"
2624,BOSTON,"under his sway: Persia, Media, and Assyria. When he was peacefully"
2625,BOSTON,"settled in his great empire, he busied himself with framing laws for its"
2626,BOSTON,"prosperity and repose. ""For a king,"" said he, ""should be the shepherd of"
2627,BOSTON,"his people, and exercise vigilance and care over his flock."""
2628,BOSTON,
2629,BOSTON,"This sentiment reminds us of the prophecy of Isaiah, uttered more than a"
2630,BOSTON,"century before the birth of this prince, and 170 years before the fall"
2631,BOSTON,"of Babylon, which it also predicts: ""That saith of Cyrus, he is my"
2632,BOSTON,"shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure."""
2633,BOSTON,
2634,BOSTON,Prosperity crowned his efforts for the good of his people; and unbroken
2635,BOSTON,"health, the reward of temperance and tranquillity of spirit, enabled him"
2636,BOSTON,"to persevere in these efforts. Yet he kept in his secret heart, a fear,"
2637,BOSTON,"founded on the changes of this mortal life, and the frailty of man,"
2638,BOSTON,"which restrained all pride, and kept him as humble as he was active and"
2639,BOSTON,"powerful. Of him it might have been said, as it was of our own"
2640,BOSTON,"Washington, that true merit was the foundation of his greatness."
2641,BOSTON,
2642,BOSTON,"Therefore, he affected no self-importance, but was affable to all, and"
2643,BOSTON,repaid by cordial attachment. Cicero asserts that during the whole
2644,BOSTON,"period of his reign, he was never heard to speak a rough or angry word."
2645,BOSTON,"Xenophon speaks of him, as exhibiting the ""model of a perfect"
2646,BOSTON,"government."" Herodotus modifies this praise, and charges him with some"
2647,BOSTON,"faults. But the most exalted characters are subject to error, and the"
2648,BOSTON,"purest may be misunderstood or misrepresented. Even patriarchs,"
2649,BOSTON,"prophets, and apostles, have taught us by their own failings, the"
2650,BOSTON,"infirmity of our nature, and we should not require or expect perfection"
2651,BOSTON,"in others, until we are able to give an example of it ourselves."
2652,BOSTON,
2653,BOSTON,"When Cyrus approached death, he called around him his children and chief"
2654,BOSTON,"officers, gave them solemn and excellent advice by which to regulate"
2655,BOSTON,"their future conduct, and, thanking Heaven for all its blessings, calmly"
2656,BOSTON,resigned his breath.
2657,BOSTON,
2658,BOSTON,"Cambyses, his successor, supplied mournful proof of the contrast that"
2659,BOSTON,may exist between the son and the father. He was barbarous both at home
2660,BOSTON,"and abroad, and put to death his own brother, from malignant envy,"
2661,BOSTON,because he was able to shoot with a larger bow than himself. We will
2662,BOSTON,"turn from the contemplation of such wickedness, to some of the last"
2663,BOSTON,"words of the great Cyrus to his children, which are here presented in a"
2664,BOSTON,poetical garb:
2665,BOSTON,
2666,BOSTON,"Behold, I die! Restore my form"
2667,BOSTON,"To dust, to darkness, and the worm:"
2668,BOSTON,For from the earth it first arose.
2669,BOSTON,"And there, at last, it finds repose."
2670,BOSTON,
2671,BOSTON,"Yet when this breath forsakes the clay,"
2672,BOSTON,Think ye the spirit shall decay?
2673,BOSTON,"No, no, my sons! Its mystic flight"
2674,BOSTON,"Hath ever mock'd your keenest sight,"
2675,BOSTON,Even when it deign'd with mortal care
2676,BOSTON,This prison of the flesh to share:
2677,BOSTON,"So, when stern Death my frame shall blot,"
2678,BOSTON,"It lives, though you perceive it not."
2679,BOSTON,
2680,BOSTON,Believe you trace through yonder sky
2681,BOSTON,"Your disembodied father's eye,"
2682,BOSTON,And be your motives pure and high:
2683,BOSTON,But dread the ages yet unborn
2684,BOSTON,Who stamp your deeds with praise or scorn:
2685,BOSTON,"Dread more than all, the Powers who seal"
2686,BOSTON,"That sentence, man can ne'er repeal."
2687,BOSTON,
2688,BOSTON,
2689,BOSTON,
2690,BOSTON,
2691,BOSTON,Rome and its Rulers.
2692,BOSTON,
2693,BOSTON,
2694,BOSTON,The magnificent city of Rome was at first a rude hamlet of ruder people.
2695,BOSTON,"Its earliest buildings were upon the Palatine Hill, near the Tiber. In"
2696,BOSTON,"process of time, it extended itself over the six adjacent eminences."
2697,BOSTON,"Hence the name that it sometimes bears of the ""seven-hilled city."""
2698,BOSTON,
2699,BOSTON,"Two brothers, Romulus and Remus, were its founders, 752 years before the"
2700,BOSTON,"birth of Christ. They were twins, and trained up in the humble and hardy"
2701,BOSTON,habits of a shepherd's life. But from feeding their peaceful flocks they
2702,BOSTON,aspired to rule men.
2703,BOSTON,
2704,BOSTON,"Romulus reared a wall around a portion of the new settlement, in which"
2705,BOSTON,"he took pride. Remus, in sport, or contempt, jumped over it, saying that"
2706,BOSTON,he had given proof it would afford no protection against invaders.
2707,BOSTON,"Romulus, forgetting the love he should have borne to his twin-brother,"
2708,BOSTON,"in a transport of rage struck him dead upon the spot. Thus, to the first"
2709,BOSTON,"king of Rome, as to the first-born of Eden, might have been said, ""The"
2710,BOSTON,"voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto thee from the ground."" He who"
2711,BOSTON,"gave his own name to the Mistress of the World, left that name stained"
2712,BOSTON,with the crime of fratricide.
2713,BOSTON,
2714,BOSTON,The kings of Rome were the same in number as the hills on which she
2715,BOSTON,"seated herself. The seventh, and last, was Tarquinius Superbus. After"
2716,BOSTON,the abolition of the royal sway she had various forms of government.
2717,BOSTON,"Sometimes her rulers bore the title of Consuls, Dictators, Tribunes,"
2718,BOSTON,"Ediles, and Questors. Then the supreme power was vested in Emperors, of"
2719,BOSTON,whom there were fifty-five. Some of these were fearful examples of every
2720,BOSTON,vice. The excess of luxurious indulgence and pitiless cruelty darken
2721,BOSTON,their names in history.
2722,BOSTON,
2723,BOSTON,"Among this mass of shameless rulers, five appeared in regular"
2724,BOSTON,"succession, who, by their comparatively virtuous course, have obtained"
2725,BOSTON,"the honourable distinction of the ""good Emperors."" The first of this"
2726,BOSTON,"line was Nerva, who began his reign in the year 96 after the Christian"
2727,BOSTON,"era, when he was himself quite advanced in age. He was a native of"
2728,BOSTON,"Spain, and the first foreigner who had been permitted to wear Rome's"
2729,BOSTON,"imperial purple. He was welcomed with great joy, for the people had just"
2730,BOSTON,been suffering from the monstrous barbarities of Domitian. Nerva was a
2731,BOSTON,"man of gentle temper, and like Numa Pompilius, the second king, who had"
2732,BOSTON,"reigned about eight centuries before him, a true lover of peace. With"
2733,BOSTON,"paternal care he used the public money for the public good, instead of"
2734,BOSTON,"wasting it in mad extravagance, like his predecessors. Unfortunately,"
2735,BOSTON,"his sway was short, only about sixteen months, when he fell a victim to"
2736,BOSTON,"a sudden fever, at the age of sixty-six. His memory was gratefully"
2737,BOSTON,"embalmed, for his justice and generosity, and the tranquillity he had"
2738,BOSTON,given to the empire.

2741,BOSTON,"scope of all your actions.""--p. 98]"
2742,BOSTON,
2743,BOSTON,"Trajan, his successor, was also born in Spain. In his youth he had been"
2744,BOSTON,"the pupil of Plutarch, the philosopher, who after his elevation thus"
2745,BOSTON,"addressed him in an affectionate speech ""Continue the command of your"
2746,BOSTON,passions. Make virtue the scope of all your actions. You have it in
2747,BOSTON,"your power to render me the most honoured of men, by continuing your"
2748,BOSTON,"present course of conduct. If you follow my instructions, I shall glory"
2749,BOSTON,"in having given them. If you neglect them, this address shall be my"
2750,BOSTON,"testimony, that you have not erred through the counsel or authority of"
2751,BOSTON,"Plutarch."""
2752,BOSTON,
2753,BOSTON,The Emperor did not disregard the motives set before him by his revered
2754,BOSTON,"teacher. The principles that had been impressed on his boyhood, were as"
2755,BOSTON,"a guiding helm amid the cares of state. He carefully improved his time,"
2756,BOSTON,"was moderate in expense, and modest amid pomp and power. Among his"
2757,BOSTON,"public works was a noble bridge over the Danube, whose massy ruins are"
2758,BOSTON,still seen by the traveller. He adorned the city of Rome with splendid
2759,BOSTON,"and substantial buildings, and delighted to draw men of merit from"
2760,BOSTON,"obscurity. His faults were, great fondness for war, and persecuting the"
2761,BOSTON,"Christians, which his strong attachment to the heathen ritual in which"
2762,BOSTON,"he had been educated made him consider as a duty, or a proof of"
2763,BOSTON,"sincerity. He died, during an absence from home, of apoplexy, at the age"
2764,BOSTON,"of sixty-three, having reigned nineteen years."
2765,BOSTON,
2766,BOSTON,"Adrian, the fifteenth Roman Emperor, began his reign in 117. He had"
2767,BOSTON,"received an excellent education. He was an eloquent speaker, and wrote"
2768,BOSTON,"well, both in prose and poetry. One of his greatest virtues was, that he"
2769,BOSTON,truly loved peace. He treated those who were in humble stations with
2770,BOSTON,"kindness. He said that the chief ruler of a nation should be ""like the"
2771,BOSTON,"sun, giving warmth to the lowly vales as well as to the mountains."" He"
2772,BOSTON,"travelled to France, to Germany, and to Holland; not to make war, but to"
2773,BOSTON,show himself friendly to their inhabitants. From thence he went to
2774,BOSTON,"England, and built a wall from Cumberland to Northumberland, to assist"
2775,BOSTON,"in protecting that part of the island from the natives of the north,"
2776,BOSTON,"who were unfriendly and barbarous. He visited Spain and Athens, showing"
2777,BOSTON,"kindness to the people, and went also to many parts of Asia and Africa."
2778,BOSTON,"He made just laws, and favoured men of learning. He had so remarkable a"
2779,BOSTON,"memory, that he could repeat the substance of a book after once reading"
2780,BOSTON,"it, and he knew the name of every soldier in the Roman army. Though he"
2781,BOSTON,"had so many virtues, he had also great faults. He committed some acts of"
2782,BOSTON,"cruelty, and was very unkind to the Jews. He banished them from their"
2783,BOSTON,"beloved city Jerusalem, and forbade them to come even in sight of it, or"
2784,BOSTON,"to enter it, except one day in the year. In his last sickness he became"
2785,BOSTON,"impatient of pain, and even entreated those around him to take away his"
2786,BOSTON,"life. He cried out, ""How miserable a thing it is to seek death and not"
2787,BOSTON,"to find it!"" Being a heathen, he had not the comfort of hope in another"
2788,BOSTON,"life. Just before he expired, he composed some verses addressed to his"
2789,BOSTON,"soul, expressing uncertainty with regard to its immortality. He died at"
2790,BOSTON,"the age of sixty-two, having reigned twenty-two years."
2791,BOSTON,
2792,BOSTON,Titus Antoninus Pius was one of the most faultless of the good emperors.
2793,BOSTON,"As his father died in his childhood, his mother and grandfather"
2794,BOSTON,"conducted his education. To them, as well as to all aged persons, he"
2795,BOSTON,"habitually paid great respect. In his youth, his temper was so mild and"
2796,BOSTON,"affectionate, that he gained the love of all with whom he associated."
2797,BOSTON,"After he became Emperor, he distributed among the poor the greater part"
2798,BOSTON,of the revenue from his own estates. He completed a magnificent tomb for
2799,BOSTON,"his predecessor Adrian, repaired many of the edifices of ancient Greece,"
2800,BOSTON,"and built a wall in Britain, between the rivers Esk and Tweed. He"
2801,BOSTON,"laboured to prevent wars, and uttered the noble sentiment,"
2802,BOSTON,
2803,BOSTON,"""I had rather save the life of one citizen than to destroy a thousand"
2804,BOSTON,"enemies."""
2805,BOSTON,
2806,BOSTON,"He was friendly to the Christians, and showed them favour. He sought to"
2807,BOSTON,"be a peace-maker between all contending persons, and to set a consistent"
2808,BOSTON,example of moral excellence. In these respects he has been compared both
2809,BOSTON,"to Nerva and to Numa, the latter of whom preserved the blessings of"
2810,BOSTON,peace to the people during his whole reign of forty-three years. Marcus
2811,BOSTON,"Antoninus reigned somewhat more than half as long, namely, twenty-two"
2812,BOSTON,"years. During a residence at one of his country-seats, he was attacked"
2813,BOSTON,by a fever which proved fatal to him at the age of seventy-four. He was
2814,BOSTON,"loved and lamented by the whole empire, over which he had ruled as a"
2815,BOSTON,"father, seeking the welfare of his children."
2816,BOSTON,
2817,BOSTON,"Marcus Aurelius is a favourite with historians, and has been ranked"
2818,BOSTON,"among the greatest of the good emperors. He made his predecessor, who"
2819,BOSTON,"was his father-in-law, his model in the affairs of government. He took"
2820,BOSTON,"pleasure in praising his virtues, and thus affectionately mentions some"
2821,BOSTON,"of them, in a work of which he was the author:"
2822,BOSTON,
2823,BOSTON,"""I have much observed his meekness, and his constancy without wavering,"
2824,BOSTON,in those things which after due deliberation he had determined. I
2825,BOSTON,"remember his freedom from all vanity, his patient industry, his"
2826,BOSTON,readiness to hear any man that had aught to say tending to the common
2827,BOSTON,good. How readily and impartially would he give every man his due. How
2828,BOSTON,"modestly would he condescend to other men, as though he was an ordinary"
2829,BOSTON,"man himself. How accurately would he examine and consult, and how"
2830,BOSTON,patiently would he hear others. Neither would he hastily give over the
2831,BOSTON,"search of difficult matters, or be easily satisfied with sudden notions"
2832,BOSTON,"and opinions. How carefully would he preserve his friends, never"
2833,BOSTON,"treating them with neglect, or growing weary of them."
2834,BOSTON,
2835,BOSTON,"I love to remember his contented mind, his cheerful countenance, his"
2836,BOSTON,"care to foresee things afar off, and to give orders without noise or"
2837,BOSTON,"clamour. How was all flattery repressed by him, and how carefully did he"
2838,BOSTON,"observe all things necessary to the government, and keep an account of"
2839,BOSTON,all the common expenses. And when he was reproached by some for this
2840,BOSTON,"very strictness, how patiently did he bear it. He was neither studious"
2841,BOSTON,"to please men, nor ambitious of popular applause, but sober in all"
2842,BOSTON,"things, every where observant of that which was fitting. In those things"
2843,BOSTON,"which conduce to ease and convenience, of which his great fortune"
2844,BOSTON,"allowed him a plentiful supply, he was without pride or boasting. He"
2845,BOSTON,"freely enjoyed them when they were present, and when they were absent,"
2846,BOSTON,was never uneasy for the want of them. He was commended as a man that
2847,BOSTON,"could not endure to be flattered, but was able to govern both himself"
2848,BOSTON,"and others. He honoured all true philosophers, without upbraiding those"
2849,BOSTON,who were not so. In his conversation he was sociable and delightful. How
2850,BOSTON,"gently would he yield to those who had any peculiar talent, such as"
2851,BOSTON,"eloquence, or knowledge of the laws, or ancient customs, and how"
2852,BOSTON,"heartily he endeavoured that everyone might, according to their"
2853,BOSTON,"excellence, be regarded and esteemed. How constant was he in his"
2854,BOSTON,"attention to business; and after his great fits of headache, how fresh"
2855,BOSTON,and vigorous would he return to his wonted affairs. In all things having
2856,BOSTON,"respect unto men, only as men, and to the equity of things, and not unto"
2857,BOSTON,"the glory that might follow."""
2858,BOSTON,
2859,BOSTON,Marcus Aurelius still further evinced his gratitude and reverence for
2860,BOSTON,"Antoninus Pius, by erecting to his memory a beautifully sculptured"
2861,BOSTON,"marble column, more than a hundred feet in height, and surmounted by"
2862,BOSTON,"his statue, which may still be seen at Rome, though more than 1700 years"
2863,BOSTON,old.
2864,BOSTON,
2865,BOSTON,He was a lover of knowledge. Through his whole life he laboured to
2866,BOSTON,"obtain it. After he became an emperor, he used to go, and sometimes on"
2867,BOSTON,"foot, to the house of a man of wisdom, named Apollonius, that he might"
2868,BOSTON,take lessons of him. He valued intellectual riches more than gold or
2869,BOSTON,"power. Among all the cares of state, he found time for it, saying that"
2870,BOSTON,it was his desire to learn as long as he lived.
2871,BOSTON,
2872,BOSTON,"He was particularly attached to the study of philosophy, and used to"
2873,BOSTON,"call it his mother, to prove his affection. He established schools for"
2874,BOSTON,"it, both at Rome and Athens. He often gave lectures in that science to"
2875,BOSTON,"the people, deeming it no derogation from imperial dignity to instruct"
2876,BOSTON,"and elevate the public mind. Especially, when about to be absent from"
2877,BOSTON,"the city, for any length of time, he thus addressed his people, that if"
2878,BOSTON,"he never returned, their last remembrance of him might be connected with"
2879,BOSTON,precepts of virtue.
2880,BOSTON,
2881,BOSTON,"His principal faults were allowing the Christians to be persecuted, and"
2882,BOSTON,"being often engaged in war, though his principles revolted against it,"
2883,BOSTON,"and he considered it a calamity. He died at Vindobona, where the city of"
2884,BOSTON,"Vienna, in Austria, now stands, after the sickness of a week, on March"
2885,BOSTON,"17th, 180; having lived fifty-nine years, and reigned nineteen. He was"
2886,BOSTON,"so much beloved, that many kept his image or statue in their houses,"
2887,BOSTON,"offering it flowers and incense, as one of their heathen gods."
2888,BOSTON,
2889,BOSTON,The two last of these Emperors were called Antonines. Their united
2890,BOSTON,"periods of sway amounted to forty-one years, and Rome never enjoyed"
2891,BOSTON,"greater happiness than during their sovereignty. Afterwards, it declined"
2892,BOSTON,both in prosperity and virtue.
2893,BOSTON,
2894,BOSTON,The reigns of the five good Emperors extended over a period of
2895,BOSTON,"eighty-four years, just the length of one of the revolutions of the"
2896,BOSTON,planet Herschel around the sun. With a single one of his years he
2897,BOSTON,measured out the earthly span of all these mighty monarchs. Ere he
2898,BOSTON,"returned to his annual goal, they had risen, and flourished, and fallen."
2899,BOSTON,
2900,BOSTON,A hoary-headed man might have seen the whole of their imperial sway. An
2901,BOSTON,"aged English statesman, Sir John Mason, outlived five of his own"
2902,BOSTON,"sovereigns. In looking back upon so long a life, he said that he had"
2903,BOSTON,"received favours from them all, and been promoted to many honours, but"
2904,BOSTON,"that religion and hope in heaven were the truest riches, and all things"
2905,BOSTON,"else forsook him, but his God, his duty, and his prayers."
2906,BOSTON,
2907,BOSTON,The study of history is salutary to the young mind. To know what has
2908,BOSTON,"been done in all countries, since man was placed upon the earth, is a"
2909,BOSTON,"laudable curiosity, and an ennobling pursuit. To form a correct opinion"
2910,BOSTON,"of the characters thus presented us, affords useful exercise to the"
2911,BOSTON,"judgment. Those who have delighted only to shed blood, and to build"
2912,BOSTON,"their fame on the misery of mankind, should not be admired though the"
2913,BOSTON,world may pronounce them heroes.
2914,BOSTON,
2915,BOSTON,"In reading of the truly wise and good, we should strive to imbibe their"
2916,BOSTON,spirit and tread in their steps. The highest end of knowledge is to
2917,BOSTON,"advance in goodness and piety, and to make the heart and life more"
2918,BOSTON,acceptable to God.

2995,BOSTON,The Good and Bad Emperor.
2996,BOSTON,
2997,BOSTON,
2998,BOSTON,"Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was the seventeenth Emperor of Rome, and began"
2999,BOSTON,"his reign on the 2nd of March, 161 years before the Christian era."
3000,BOSTON,"Besides these three names, he had several others, _Annius Verus_, after"
3001,BOSTON,"his grandfather; _Elius_, which was given him by the Emperor Adrian;"
3002,BOSTON,"_Verissimus_, from his constant regard to truth; and _Philosophos_, from"
3003,BOSTON,his love of wisdom.
3004,BOSTON,
3005,BOSTON,"In early childhood he was instructed by his mother, who took great pains"
3006,BOSTON,"to teach him not to do wrong, or to think unkindly of any person. She"
3007,BOSTON,"would not permit him to be dainty in his food, or to partake in luxuries"
3008,BOSTON,that might be hurtful to his health; and though he saw much to tempt his
3009,BOSTON,"taste, he regarded the restrictions of his mother. She also counselled"
3010,BOSTON,"him not to be proud, but to relieve the poor whenever he had"
3011,BOSTON,"opportunity. By his respect and obedience to her, he began life with the"
3012,BOSTON,elements of virtue and happiness.
3013,BOSTON,
3014,BOSTON,"His grandfather also conducted a part of his education, in childhood. He"
3015,BOSTON,"listened reverently to his words, and followed all his directions. Thus,"
3016,BOSTON,"he began to honour and love the aged, and to bow down before them. In"
3017,BOSTON,"one of the wise books which he wrote in manhood, the very first"
3018,BOSTON,sentences are expressive of gratitude to these his earliest teachers.
3019,BOSTON,
3020,BOSTON,"""Of my grandfather, I learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from"
3021,BOSTON,"all anger and passion. Of my mother, I learned to be religious and"
3022,BOSTON,"bountiful, to forbear not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content"
3023,BOSTON,"myself with a spare diet, and to fly all the excesses that come from"
3024,BOSTON,"great wealth."""
3025,BOSTON,
3026,BOSTON,"Not content with the high moral training of his immediate instructors,"
3027,BOSTON,he was careful to imitate whatever he saw that was praiseworthy in the
3028,BOSTON,"conduct of others. ""Of my brother,"" he writes, ""I have learned to be"
3029,BOSTON,"kind and loving to all of my house and family, bountiful and liberal in"
3030,BOSTON,"the largest measure, always to hope for the best, and to believe that my"
3031,BOSTON,"friends love me."""
3032,BOSTON,
3033,BOSTON,"As he grew older, masters were called in to direct his studies. Two of"
3034,BOSTON,"these were from Greece, and he acquired the language of that classic"
3035,BOSTON,"clime with great accuracy. Junius Rusticus, his instructor in"
3036,BOSTON,"philosophy, he says, ""taught me to write letters simply, and without"
3037,BOSTON,"affectation, to be easily reconciled to those who had offended me, as"
3038,BOSTON,"soon as any of them would be content to seek unto me again; also, to"
3039,BOSTON,"read with diligence, and never to be content with light and superficial"
3040,BOSTON,"knowledge."""
3041,BOSTON,
3042,BOSTON,He was particularly partial to that department of philosophy which
3043,BOSTON,teaches the regulation of the temper and conduct. Such excellence did he
3044,BOSTON,"attain in its principles and their exemplification, that he was"
3045,BOSTON,"permitted to assume, at the age of twelve, the philosophical gown. His"
3046,BOSTON,"rapid progress in knowledge, and preeminence for truth and integrity,"
3047,BOSTON,"gained him the favour of the Emperor Adrian, who was a patron of"
3048,BOSTON,"learning and virtue. Among other distinctions, he appointed him prefect"
3049,BOSTON,"of the city, when only fifteen years old. It was an office of power and"
3050,BOSTON,"importance, comprising the superintendence of buildings, and navigation,"
3051,BOSTON,"and the judging of causes, as a chief magistrate, if the Emperor should"
3052,BOSTON,"be absent from the city. In this responsible station, he acquitted"
3053,BOSTON,"himself with justice and dignity, not at all vain of his elevation, but"
3054,BOSTON,improving every opportunity to advance in knowledge.
3055,BOSTON,
3056,BOSTON,"Amid the pressure of his public offices and private studies, he did not"
3057,BOSTON,"overlook the domestic affections. To his sister Annia Corneficia, he"
3058,BOSTON,"showed the utmost tenderness. He liked to impart his knowledge to her,"
3059,BOSTON,and to have her enjoy the new ideas that he gathered. After the death of
3060,BOSTON,"their father, he became her watchful protector, and the paternal estate"
3061,BOSTON,"having been left to him, he presented it to her, rejoicing at having it"
3062,BOSTON,in his power to make her so valuable a gift. His generosity was equalled
3063,BOSTON,"by his gratitude. When he became Emperor of Rome, he remembered all who"
3064,BOSTON,"had done him services, and recompensed them. Especially to his teachers,"
3065,BOSTON,his regard was unbounded. His obligations to them he frequently
3066,BOSTON,"mentioned, and said the knowledge with which they had stored his mind"
3067,BOSTON,"was more precious than the wealth of an empire. While they lived, he"
3068,BOSTON,"loaded them with benefits. When they died, he paid to their memories the"
3069,BOSTON,tribute of affectionate respect. He laid chaplets of flowers on their
3070,BOSTON,"tombs, and caused their statues to be made of gold, which he kept in his"
3071,BOSTON,domestic chapel.
3072,BOSTON,
3073,BOSTON,In this feature of attachment to his instructors he resembled Alexander
3074,BOSTON,"the Great, who was never weary of testifying gratitude to his master,"
3075,BOSTON,"Aristotle. Comparing it to the affection for his father, he said, ""I am"
3076,BOSTON,"indebted to Philip for _living_, and to Aristotle for _living well_."" He"
3077,BOSTON,"rebuilt and beautified Stagyra, after it had been destroyed, because it"
3078,BOSTON,"was the native place of Aristotle, and enclosed a copy of Homer's poems,"
3079,BOSTON,"to which this beloved preceptor had written notes, in a gold box,"
3080,BOSTON,"carrying it wherever he went with his armies, and laying it under his"
3081,BOSTON,"head every night, when he retired to rest. In a letter to his teacher,"
3082,BOSTON,"he says, ""I had rather surpass the rest of men in the knowledge of"
3083,BOSTON,"sublime and excellent things, than in greatness and extent of power."""
3084,BOSTON,
3085,BOSTON,"More truly great was Alexander in this sentiment, than in his renown as"
3086,BOSTON,"a warrior. And surely, in the beautiful sentiment of gratitude to our"
3087,BOSTON,"instructors in knowledge and virtue, we, who are Christians, ought not"
3088,BOSTON,to suffer ourselves to be surpassed by the followers of false gods.
3089,BOSTON,
3090,BOSTON,"When Marcus Aurelius was raised to the highest office in the Empire, he"
3091,BOSTON,felt it incumbent on him to be the father of his people. He strove to do
3092,BOSTON,good to all. He laboured to frame just laws. He directed the courts to
3093,BOSTON,"take a longer time for the transaction of business, that they might not"
3094,BOSTON,"be tempted, through haste, to neglect the causes of the poor. So great"
3095,BOSTON,"was his own industry and patience, that he not unfrequently gave ten"
3096,BOSTON,days to the study of a case whose decision was important or difficult.
3097,BOSTON,
3098,BOSTON,"He showed great respect for the opinion of the Senate, and never took"
3099,BOSTON,any portion of the revenue for public expenses without their permission.
3100,BOSTON,"He evinced much prudence in the use of what they entrusted to him. Once,"
3101,BOSTON,"when the claims of the nation were peculiarly pressing, he said to his"
3102,BOSTON,"wife, the Empress Faustina,"
3103,BOSTON,
3104,BOSTON,"""I will sell the furniture of my palace, and you can dispose of your"
3105,BOSTON,"richest clothing, rather than burden our people to part with more than"
3106,BOSTON,"they can spare."""
3107,BOSTON,
3108,BOSTON,"He was anxious for the improvement of the young, and appointed a"
3109,BOSTON,"magistrate to whom minors might apply, who needed protection or"
3110,BOSTON,assistance. He was careful to add an example of morality to the
3111,BOSTON,"precepts that he impressed on others. Though he had power to punish, it"
3112,BOSTON,was his practice to forgive those who had done him personal injuries. He
3113,BOSTON,"had a foe, named Avidius, whose slanders he generously pardoned."
3114,BOSTON,"Afterwards, hearing that Avidius had destroyed his own life, he said,"
3115,BOSTON,"""Ah! I have now lost the opportunity of changing an enemy into a"
3116,BOSTON,"friend."""
3117,BOSTON,
3118,BOSTON,He also cultivated the virtue of patience with the infirmities of
3119,BOSTON,"others. ""If we cannot make them in all things as we wish them to be,"" he"
3120,BOSTON,"used to say, ""we must take them as they are, and do the best with them"
3121,BOSTON,"that lies in our power."" This principle of forbearance was strongly put"
3122,BOSTON,"to the test by Lucius Verus, his colleague during the earlier part of"
3123,BOSTON,his reign. This person rendered little aid in the cares of the
3124,BOSTON,"government, whose authority he partook. He led an idle life, and"
3125,BOSTON,"selfishly regarded only his own wishes. He possessed much vanity, and"
3126,BOSTON,"coveted popular applause, though he did nothing to deserve it. He liked"
3127,BOSTON,"the pomp and pageantry of war, but not its hardships. Though he was"
3128,BOSTON,"forward to promote it, yet he threw its toils upon others, and when in"
3129,BOSTON,"distant countries with the Roman armies, spent his time in indolence or"
3130,BOSTON,"unmanly sports. He was addicted to indulgence in wine, and a luxurious"
3131,BOSTON,"table. Hence he injured his health, and probably shortened his days,"
3132,BOSTON,"dying suddenly in a fit, ere he was forty years old."
3133,BOSTON,
3134,BOSTON,The efforts that Marcus Aurelius made for his improvement and
3135,BOSTON,"reformation, were like those of a kind father, anxious for his erring"
3136,BOSTON,"son. He mildly reasoned with him, and faithfully advised him, and"
3137,BOSTON,"laboured to excuse his faults, even when the whole nation was"
3138,BOSTON,exasperated.
3139,BOSTON,
3140,BOSTON,"The command over his passions, which was so conspicuous in Marcus"
3141,BOSTON,"Aurelius, he derived from long study and practice of that Philosophy to"
3142,BOSTON,"which he was so much attached, as to call it his ""mother."" He made"
3143,BOSTON,"choice of the sect of the Stoics, who were sometimes called scholars of"
3144,BOSTON,"the Portico, because their master gave his lectures in a portico adorned"
3145,BOSTON,"with pictures, at Athens, in Greece. Zeno, the founder of this school of"
3146,BOSTON,"philosophers, discouraged luxury, and the pride of wealth. He set an"
3147,BOSTON,"example of great simplicity of life, dressing plainly, and being frugal"
3148,BOSTON,"in all his expenses. Bread, figs, and honey, were his principal diet,"
3149,BOSTON,"and when the most distinguished men sat at his table, he made no change"
3150,BOSTON,"in its provisions. He was modest in the estimation of himself, and amid"
3151,BOSTON,"any concourse of people, sought the humblest and lowest place. To poor"
3152,BOSTON,"men of merit, he paid the same respect as if they had been rich. He had"
3153,BOSTON,"many opposers, but never lost his temper through their provocations. He"
3154,BOSTON,"taught that virtue was the true good, that happiness existed in the mind"
3155,BOSTON,"and not in outward circumstances, and that men should be unmoved either"
3156,BOSTON,by pleasure or pain. His temperance and tranquil spirit were probably
3157,BOSTON,"favourable to longevity, as he died on the verge of ninety-nine, two"
3158,BOSTON,hundred and sixty-four years before the Christian era.
3159,BOSTON,
3160,BOSTON,Marcus Aurelius embodied some of the precepts of his philosophy in a
3161,BOSTON,book which has been praised by wise and learned men. As a specimen of
3162,BOSTON,"its style, I will extract some of his sentiments on the diligent"
3163,BOSTON,improvement of time.
3164,BOSTON,
3165,BOSTON,"""In the morning, if thou feelest reluctant to rise, consider how much"
3166,BOSTON,"work thou hast to do. Say to thy heart, Am I unwilling to go about that"
3167,BOSTON,"for which I was born, and brought into this world? Was I made to please"
3168,BOSTON,"myself idly, in a warm bed?"
3169,BOSTON,
3170,BOSTON,"""Wert thou born only to enjoy pleasure? Was it not rather that thou"
3171,BOSTON,"mightest be always busy, and in action? Seest thou not how every tree"
3172,BOSTON,"and plant, how sparrows and ants, spiders and bees, are industrious and"
3173,BOSTON,intent to perform what belongs unto them? And wilt not thou hasten to do
3174,BOSTON,"that which thy nobler nature doth require?"""
3175,BOSTON,
3176,BOSTON,In his Meditations he thus reasons on the firmness with which this
3177,BOSTON,mortal existence should be resigned; and his argument is as strong as
3178,BOSTON,"any that philosophy, unenlightened by the Gospel, could furnish."
3179,BOSTON,
3180,BOSTON,"""Thou hast taken ship. Thou hast sailed. Thou hast come to land. Get out"
3181,BOSTON,"of the ship into another life. The Gods are there."""
3182,BOSTON,
3183,BOSTON,"Yet this good Emperor, who seemed as perfect as it was possible for"
3184,BOSTON,"pagan morality and belief to make any human being, still had faults. One"
3185,BOSTON,of the most prominent of these was persecuting the Christians. That a
3186,BOSTON,"man so habitually mild should have been thus severe, can only be"
3187,BOSTON,explained on the principle that he believed himself to be doing right.
3188,BOSTON,"Thus the Apostle Paul, when he imprisoned and punished the followers of"
3189,BOSTON,"Christ, and consented to the stoning of Stephen, ""calling upon God,"""
3190,BOSTON,persuaded himself that he was discharging a sacred duty.
3191,BOSTON,
3192,BOSTON,Marcus Aurelius was much influenced by the priests of the heathen
3193,BOSTON,"temples, who were jealous of whatever interfered with their own"
3194,BOSTON,"idol-worship, and also by the philosophers, who despised the Christians."
3195,BOSTON,"Much of the barbarity to which they were subjected was hidden from him,"
3196,BOSTON,as the governors of the distant provinces put many to death without his
3197,BOSTON,"knowledge. Still, he ought to have more thoroughly investigated the"
3198,BOSTON,"truth with regard to them, and had he been acquainted with the New"
3199,BOSTON,"Testament, would doubtless have admired its pure and sublime morality."
3200,BOSTON,
3201,BOSTON,"Another of his faults was, that he so often engaged in war when he did"
3202,BOSTON,"not approve of it, but considered it both a calamity and disgrace. It"
3203,BOSTON,"has been already mentioned that his colleague, Lucius Verus, was proud"
3204,BOSTON,"of military parade, and encouraged bloodshed. The Romans, also, were an"
3205,BOSTON,"iron-hearted people, placing their glory in foreign conquest. Any"
3206,BOSTON,"disorder in the countries that they had subjected, they were prompt to"
3207,BOSTON,punish by the sword.
3208,BOSTON,
3209,BOSTON,"On one such occasion, when Marcus Aurelius led an army into Germany, to"
3210,BOSTON,"chastise the Quadi, a tribe who had rebelled against the sway of Rome,"
3211,BOSTON,some remarkable circumstances occurred. It was a wild region which he
3212,BOSTON,"traversed, where it was difficult to obtain sustenance. The troops were"
3213,BOSTON,"in danger of famine. The heat was intense, and no rain had fallen for a"
3214,BOSTON,"long time, so that the grass was withered, and many of their horses"
3215,BOSTON,"perished. The brooks and fountains wasted away, and they endured"
3216,BOSTON,distressing thirst. The enemy shut them up between the mountains and
3217,BOSTON,"themselves, preventing as far as possible their approach to the rivers."
3218,BOSTON,Then in this weak condition they forced them to give battle or be cut
3219,BOSTON,off.
3220,BOSTON,
3221,BOSTON,"It was pitiful to see the Roman soldiers standing in their ranks, with"
3222,BOSTON,"enfeebled limbs and parched lips, almost suffocated with heat. For four"
3223,BOSTON,days they had scarcely tasted water. As their barbarous enemies pressed
3224,BOSTON,"closely and fiercely upon them, the Emperor advanced to the head of his"
3225,BOSTON,"forces, and, oppressed with anxiety, raised his eyes to heaven, and"
3226,BOSTON,"said,"
3227,BOSTON,
3228,BOSTON,"""By this hand, which hath taken no life away, I desire to appease Thee."
3229,BOSTON,"Giver of life! I pray unto Thee."""
3230,BOSTON,
3231,BOSTON,"Poor and empty, indeed, was this form of heathen devotion, contrasted"
3232,BOSTON,"with the triumphant trust of the king of Judah, who, when the mighty"
3233,BOSTON,"host of the Ethiopians stood ready to swallow him up, exclaimed,"
3234,BOSTON,
3235,BOSTON,"""It is nothing for God to help, whether by many or by them that have no"
3236,BOSTON,"power."""
3237,BOSTON,
3238,BOSTON,"Then it was told the Emperor, that there was in the camp an Egyptian,"
3239,BOSTON,who boasted that the gods of his country could give rain.
3240,BOSTON,
3241,BOSTON,"""Call him forth!"" was the imperial command, ""bid him pray for water to"
3242,BOSTON,"relieve our thirst, and make to his gods any offerings that spirit"
3243,BOSTON,"propitiate them."""
3244,BOSTON,
3245,BOSTON,"The dark-browed man came forward and with many ceremonies invoked Isis,"
3246,BOSTON,the goddess who presided over the waters. He implored her with the most
3247,BOSTON,"piercing earnestness to be gracious, and give rain. Thus the"
3248,BOSTON,"idol-priests, during the long drought in Israel, under Ahab, when the"
3249,BOSTON,"grass and brooks dried up, and the cattle died, cried in their frantic"
3250,BOSTON,"sacrifices, ""from morning until noon, Oh Baal! hear us. But there was no"
3251,BOSTON,"voice, neither any that regarded."""
3252,BOSTON,
3253,BOSTON,"In the pause of despair that ensued, some Christian soldiers, who had"
3254,BOSTON,"been constrained to join the army, were led forward. Kneeling on the"
3255,BOSTON,"glowing sands, they besought the Great Maker of heaven and earth, for"
3256,BOSTON,"the sake of their dear crucified Saviour, to pity, and to save. Solemnly"
3257,BOSTON,arose their voices in that time of trouble.
3258,BOSTON,
3259,BOSTON,But the interval allotted to this supplication of faith was brief. The
3260,BOSTON,conflict might no longer be deferred. As they approached to join in
3261,BOSTON,"battle, the enemy exulted to see the Roman soldiers perishing with"
3262,BOSTON,"thirst, and worn almost to skeletons, through famine and hardship."
3263,BOSTON,
3264,BOSTON,"Suddenly the skies grew black. At first a few large drops fell, Heaven's"
3265,BOSTON,"sweet promise of mercy. Then came a plentiful shower, then rain in"
3266,BOSTON,"torrents. The sufferers, with shouts of joy, caught it in their helmets,"
3267,BOSTON,and in the hollow of their shields. The blessed draught gave them new
3268,BOSTON,strength and courage.
3269,BOSTON,
3270,BOSTON,"While they were yet drinking, their foes rushed upon them, and blood was"
3271,BOSTON,mingled with the water that quenched their thirst. But the storm grew
3272,BOSTON,"more terrible, with keen flashes of lightning, and thunder heavily"
3273,BOSTON,"reverberating from rock to rock. The barbarians, smitten with sudden"
3274,BOSTON,"panic, exclaimed that the gods fought against them with the fires of"
3275,BOSTON,"heaven, and fled from the field. Thus the fortune of the day was turned,"
3276,BOSTON,and the vanquished left victors.
3277,BOSTON,
3278,BOSTON,Marcus Aurelius received this deliverance with deep gratitude. In his
3279,BOSTON,"heart he connected it with the prayer of the Christians, and caused"
3280,BOSTON,their persecutions to cease. An ancient historian mentions that the
3281,BOSTON,"soldiers who had thus supplicated for relief, received the name of the"
3282,BOSTON,"""thundering legion,"" and were permitted to have a thunderbolt graven on"
3283,BOSTON,"their shields, as a memorial of the tempest that had discomfited their"
3284,BOSTON,"enemies, and saved the Roman forces, when ready to perish. The Emperor,"
3285,BOSTON,"in his letter to the Senate, recorded the events of that wonderful"
3286,BOSTON,"occasion, which, among others connected with the war he then conducted,"
3287,BOSTON,"were sculptured on the Antonine column, still standing in the city of"
3288,BOSTON,Rome.
3289,BOSTON,
3290,BOSTON,"When the career of Marcus Aurelius terminated, and his time came to die,"
3291,BOSTON,"he gave parting advice to his son and successor, Commodus, solemnly"
3292,BOSTON,"charging his chief officers and the friends who loved him, to aid him in"
3293,BOSTON,the discharge of his duties. Though he uttered so many precepts of
3294,BOSTON,"wisdom and fatherly tenderness, it still seemed as if much was left"
3295,BOSTON,"unspoken, which he would fain have said. Anxious care sat upon his brow"
3296,BOSTON,after his pale lips breathed no sound. It was supposed that this trouble
3297,BOSTON,"was for his son, in whose right dispositions and habits he could have"
3298,BOSTON,little confidence.
3299,BOSTON,
3300,BOSTON,"Commodus was the only son of Marcus Aurelius, his twin brother having"
3301,BOSTON,died during infancy. The utmost pains had been taken with his education.
3302,BOSTON,"But he had no love of knowledge, preferring sports or idleness, having"
3303,BOSTON,no correct value of the preciousness of time.
3304,BOSTON,
3305,BOSTON,"When he was but fourteen years of age, his father permitted him to have"
3306,BOSTON,"a share in the government, hoping thus to elevate him above trifling"
3307,BOSTON,"pursuits, and implant in his young heart an interest for the people over"
3308,BOSTON,whom he was appointed to rule. But no sooner was he in possession of
3309,BOSTON,"power, than he began to abuse it. He grew haughty, and despised the"
3310,BOSTON,"rights of others, studying only his own selfish gratification."
3311,BOSTON,
3312,BOSTON,"He was nineteen, when, by the death of his father, he assumed the"
3313,BOSTON,supreme authority. For a time his course was more judicious than could
3314,BOSTON,"have been expected, as he consented to take the advice of aged"
3315,BOSTON,"counsellors, who were experienced in the cares of state. Afterwards, he"
3316,BOSTON,"rejected their guidance, and would listen only to the suggestions of"
3317,BOSTON,"young and rash advisers. Ere long he became unjust and cruel, taking"
3318,BOSTON,away life as his own caprices dictated.
3319,BOSTON,
3320,BOSTON,Among some of his most illustrious victims were the Quintillian
3321,BOSTON,"brothers, Maximin and Cardianus. They were distinguished for wealth and"
3322,BOSTON,"liberality, and a zealous kindness in relieving the poor. They were also"
3323,BOSTON,"remarkable for their mutual affection, their studies and pleasures being"
3324,BOSTON,"the same. They read the same books, and so uniform was their flow of"
3325,BOSTON,"thought, that they could pursue together the composition of the same"
3326,BOSTON,"treatise. Such delight had they in each other's company, that they were"
3327,BOSTON,"seldom seen separate, and had no idea of divided or opposing interests."
3328,BOSTON,"Rome admired this beautiful example of fraternal love, pointing them"
3329,BOSTON,"out as two forms animated by one soul. Without just cause, Commodus put"
3330,BOSTON,"to death these two brothers, who, having lived in each other's life,"
3331,BOSTON,were executed at the same time.
3332,BOSTON,
3333,BOSTON,"In the midst of such barbarities, this bad Emperor was amusing himself"
3334,BOSTON,"with the hunting of wild beasts, and the company of vain and vicious"
3335,BOSTON,"people. His excesses were at length terminated by violence, being"
3336,BOSTON,"strangled after a reign of twelve years, December 31st, 192. His memory"
3337,BOSTON,was execrated by those over whom he had ruled. Indolence and hatred of
3338,BOSTON,"knowledge in his boyhood, and love of wicked associates in youth,"
3339,BOSTON,"brought the vices of a bad heart to early ripeness, so that he was at"
3340,BOSTON,once dreaded and despised.
3341,BOSTON,
3342,BOSTON,"In analyzing his character, it will be found in two respects similar to"
3343,BOSTON,"that of Rehoboam, king of Israel, in his rejection of the advice of aged"
3344,BOSTON,"counsellors, to follow the guidance of the young, and in being the"
3345,BOSTON,unwise son of a wise father.
3346,BOSTON,
3347,BOSTON,We see that the honours won by illustrious ancestors will avail us
3348,BOSTON,"nothing, unless by our own virtues we sustain their reputation. Indeed,"
3349,BOSTON,"if we take a different course, our disgrace will be deeper, as the"
3350,BOSTON,"career of the bad Emperor, which we have briefly traced, seems darker"
3351,BOSTON,when contrasted with the lustre and glory of his predecessor.
3352,BOSTON,
3353,BOSTON,"Therefore, let every child of a good and distinguished parent, give"
3354,BOSTON,"added diligence, that he may not blemish the memory of those whom he"
3355,BOSTON,"loves, or stain the brightness of a transmitted name."
3356,BOSTON,

3360,BOSTON,Bonaparte at St. Helena.
3361,BOSTON,
3362,BOSTON,
3363,BOSTON,"The drama sinks, the tragic scene is o'er,"
3364,BOSTON,"And he who rul'd their springs, returns no more;"
3365,BOSTON,"He, who with mystery cloth'd, pale wonder chain'd,"
3366,BOSTON,"And all mankind his auditors detain'd,"
3367,BOSTON,"Whose plot unfolding agoniz'd the world,"
3368,BOSTON,"Resigns his mask, and from the stage is hurl'd."
3369,BOSTON,"When from the wilds of Corsica he broke,"
3370,BOSTON,"To snatch the sceptre and to bind the yoke,"
3371,BOSTON,"He rais'd the curtain with his dagger's blade,"
3372,BOSTON,And pour'd red carnage o'er the slumbering shade.
3373,BOSTON,"His fearful plan, terrific, strange, and new,"
3374,BOSTON,"Nor Fancy prompted, nor Experience drew,"
3375,BOSTON,It sprang inventive from a daring mind
3376,BOSTON,Where dauntless nerve and intellect combined;
3377,BOSTON,"Thence bursting wildly, like the lightning's flame,"
3378,BOSTON,Gave birth to deeds that language fails to name.
3379,BOSTON,"With battle-clouds the shrinking sun he veil'd,"
3380,BOSTON,"With flashing fires astonish'd Night assail'd,"
3381,BOSTON,"By ravag'd fields, and streams with carnage red,"
3382,BOSTON,Trac'd o'er the earth his desolating tread:
3383,BOSTON,
3384,BOSTON,Without a signal to the conflict rush'd
3385,BOSTON,"O'er friends enslav'd, foes wounded, allies crush'd;"
3386,BOSTON,"High from the Alps, amid eternal snow,"
3387,BOSTON,"Pour'd his fierce legions on the vale below,"
3388,BOSTON,With tramp of hurrying steed and armour's clang
3389,BOSTON,"War followed war; from conquest, conquest sprang."
3390,BOSTON,"In Scythian caves he fought; on Afric's sands,"
3391,BOSTON,Chas'd the wild Arab and his roving bands;
3392,BOSTON,Perch'd on the pyramids in dizzy height.
3393,BOSTON,Look'd scornful down on Alexander's might;
3394,BOSTON,"O'er Europe's realm like Attila he rush'd,"
3395,BOSTON,"Snatch'd, rent, divided, subjugated, crush'd;"
3396,BOSTON,"_Here_, planted minions in his smile to reign,"
3397,BOSTON,"_There_, loaded monarchs with his vassal chain."
3398,BOSTON,Rome's haughty pontiff trembled at the nod
3399,BOSTON,That dar'd to threat the altar of his God;
3400,BOSTON,"While Albion's ships, whose bristled lightnings glow,"
3401,BOSTON,"Were seen like Argus watching for their foe,"
3402,BOSTON,And her white cliffs in close array were lin'd
3403,BOSTON,"With sleepless soldiers, on their arms reclin'd."
3404,BOSTON,
3405,BOSTON,"Far distant realms beheld his glories tower,"
3406,BOSTON,"And France forgot her wrongs, to boast his power;"
3407,BOSTON,"The pale-brow'd conscript left, without a sigh,"
3408,BOSTON,"Home, love, and liberty, for him to die."
3409,BOSTON,"Even heaven-taught Genius proffer'd venal lays,"
3410,BOSTON,"The servile arts enlisted in his praise,"
3411,BOSTON,And the rich spoils of old Italia's shore
3412,BOSTON,"As trophies proud, his pirate legions bore."
3413,BOSTON,In that gay city where his lofty throne
3414,BOSTON,"On run rear'd, in sudden brilliance shone,"
3415,BOSTON,"The Old World met the New, and sons of fame"
3416,BOSTON,"Who fill'd with awe, in long procession came,"
3417,BOSTON,"Rais'd the imploring eye, to ask sublime"
3418,BOSTON,A milder sentence on the tyrant's crime.
3419,BOSTON,"But how can Europe grant their warm appeal,"
3420,BOSTON,"Reft of her sons, and mangled by his steel?"
3421,BOSTON,"Hath she a couch so dark, a cell so deep,"
3422,BOSTON,That burning Moscow's memory there may sleep?
3423,BOSTON,What can the scenes of purple Jaffa blot?
3424,BOSTON,And when shall Lodi's slaughter be forgot?
3425,BOSTON,Who from a race unborn shall hide the view
3426,BOSTON,"Of Jena, Austerlitz, and Waterloo?"
3427,BOSTON,"Earth, clad in sable, never can forego"
3428,BOSTON,"The deep-grav'd trace, nor man forget the woe."
3429,BOSTON,
3430,BOSTON,"Yet, _let him live_, if life can yet be borne,"
3431,BOSTON,"Disrob'd of glory, and depress'd with scorn;"
3432,BOSTON,"Yes, _let him live_, if he to life can bend,"
3433,BOSTON,"Without a flatterer, and without a friend;"
3434,BOSTON,"If from the hand he hated, he can bear"

3436,BOSTON,But who from yon lone islet shall exclude
3437,BOSTON,"The fearful step of Conscience, foul with blood?"
3438,BOSTON,What diamond shield repel the impetuous force
3439,BOSTON,Or break the shafts of pitiless remorse?
3440,BOSTON,"Oh! in his sea-girt cell of guilt and fear,"
3441,BOSTON,"Stretch the red map that marks his dire career,"
3442,BOSTON,"Light the funereal torch, in terror spread"
3443,BOSTON,"His reeking hecatombs of slaughter'd dead,"
3444,BOSTON,"And if to hearts like his, Contrition comes,"
3445,BOSTON,There let him seek her 'mid impending glooms;
3446,BOSTON,"_There_ let him live, and to mankind display"
3447,BOSTON,The mighty miseries of Ambition's sway;
3448,BOSTON,"There let him sink, to teach them by his fate,"
3449,BOSTON,The dread requital of the falsely great.
3450,BOSTON,"Great, in the stores of an ambitious mind;"
3451,BOSTON,"Great, in the deeds that desolate mankind;"
3452,BOSTON,"Great, like the pestilence in mystic shroud"
3453,BOSTON,That darts its arrow from the midnight cloud;

3461,BOSTON,
3462,BOSTON,
3463,BOSTON,"There have been in all ages some firm and consistent Christians, who,"
3464,BOSTON,"rather than deny the true faith, have chosen martyrdom. Polycarp, the"
3465,BOSTON,"Bishop of Smyrna, in Asia, was one of the earliest of these. He had"
3466,BOSTON,"become very old and venerable, when, during one of the persecutions"
3467,BOSTON,"under the Roman Emperors, his life was taken away. No accusation was"
3468,BOSTON,"ever made against him, except that he was a follower of Christ."
3469,BOSTON,
3470,BOSTON,"Suddenly there was a great noise in the streets, and multitudes shouted,"
3471,BOSTON,"""Let Polycarp be brought!"" Not dismayed at the tumult, he retired to"
3472,BOSTON,"pray, as was his custom at that hour. Then his enemies rushed forcibly"
3473,BOSTON,"into his house, and foreseeing their purpose, he said,"
3474,BOSTON,
3475,BOSTON,"""The will of the Lord be done."""
3476,BOSTON,
3477,BOSTON,"Calmly he talked with them, and as some seemed weary and exhausted, he"
3478,BOSTON,"commanded food to be set before them, remembering the words of the"
3479,BOSTON,"forgiving and compassionate Redeemer, ""If thine enemy hunger, feed him;"
3480,BOSTON,"if he thirst, give him drink."""
3481,BOSTON,
3482,BOSTON,"He requested that he might have one hour for his devotions, ere they"
3483,BOSTON,"took him from his home, to which he felt persuaded that he should return"
3484,BOSTON,"no more. This they granted, and when the hour was passed, placed him on"
3485,BOSTON,"an ass, to carry him to the city. Two Romans of wealth and power,"
3486,BOSTON,"passing by, took him up into their chariot. There they endeavoured to"
3487,BOSTON,"persuade him to sacrifice to the heathen gods. He replied, ""I shall"
3488,BOSTON,"never do what you advise."" Then they threw him out of the chariot so"
3489,BOSTON,"roughly, that he was bruised and hurt. But rising, he walked on"
3490,BOSTON,"cheerfully, notwithstanding his great age. When he was brought before"
3491,BOSTON,"the tribunal, the Governor urged him to deny the Saviour. ""Reverence"
3492,BOSTON,"thine age,"" said he. ""Repent. Swear by the fortunes of CÃ¦sar. Reproach"
3493,BOSTON,"Christ, and I will set thee at liberty."""
3494,BOSTON,
3495,BOSTON,"But Polycarp replied, ""Fourscore and six years have I served him, and he"
3496,BOSTON,hath never done me an injury. How then can I blaspheme my King and
3497,BOSTON,"Saviour?"""
3498,BOSTON,
3499,BOSTON,"""I have wild beasts,"" said the furious governor. ""I will cast you unto"
3500,BOSTON,"them, unless you change your mind."""
3501,BOSTON,
3502,BOSTON,"""Call for them,"" answered Polycarp."
3503,BOSTON,
3504,BOSTON,"""Nay, if you dread not the lions,"" said the Roman, ""I will order you to"
3505,BOSTON,"be consumed by fire, except you repent."""
3506,BOSTON,
3507,BOSTON,"""Threatenest thou me,"" said the gray-haired Christian, ""with the fire"
3508,BOSTON,"that burns for an hour, and then is extinguished? And art thou ignorant"
3509,BOSTON,"of the fire of the future judgment, and of the everlasting punishment"
3510,BOSTON,"reserved for the wicked?"""
3511,BOSTON,
3512,BOSTON,"Then the whole multitude, both of Jews and Gentiles that inhabited"
3513,BOSTON,"Smyrna, cried out furiously, ""This is the father of the Christians, who"
3514,BOSTON,"teaches all Asia not to worship our gods. Let a lion loose upon him, or"
3515,BOSTON,"let him be cast into the flame."""
3516,BOSTON,
3517,BOSTON,They hastened to raise a pile of wood and dry branches. He unclothed
3518,BOSTON,"himself at their command, and endeavoured to stoop down and take off his"
3519,BOSTON,"shoes, which he had long been unable to do, because of his age and"
3520,BOSTON,"infirmity. When all things were ready, they were going to nail him to"
3521,BOSTON,"the stake. But he said, ""He who gives me strength to bear this fire,"
3522,BOSTON,"will enable me to stand unmoved without being fastened with nails."" Then"
3523,BOSTON,he thus prayed:
3524,BOSTON,
3525,BOSTON,"""Oh Father of the beloved and blessed Son, Jesus Christ, through whom we"
3526,BOSTON,"have obtained the knowledge of Thee, Oh God of angels and"
3527,BOSTON,"principalities, of all creation, and of all the just who live in thy"
3528,BOSTON,"sight, I bless Thee that Thou hast counted me worthy of this day, and at"
3529,BOSTON,"this hour, to receive my portion in the number of martyrs, in the cup of"
3530,BOSTON,"Christ, for the resurrection of eternal life, both of soul and body, in"
3531,BOSTON,"the incorruption of the Holy Ghost, among whom may I be received before"
3532,BOSTON,"Thee, as an acceptable sacrifice, which Thou, the faithful and true God,"
3533,BOSTON,"hast prepared, promised, and fulfilled accordingly. Wherefore, I praise"
3534,BOSTON,"Thee for all these things, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, by the eternal"
3535,BOSTON,"High Priest, Jesus Christ, thy well-beloved Son, through whom and with"
3536,BOSTON,"whom, in the Holy Spirit, be glory to Thee, both now and for ever."""
3537,BOSTON,
3538,BOSTON,"Scarcely had the hoary-headed saint uttered his last earnest _Amen_, ere"
3539,BOSTON,the impatient officers kindled the pile. Flame and smoke enwrapped the
3540,BOSTON,"blackening body of the martyr. It was long in consuming, and so they ran"
3541,BOSTON,it through with a sword. Thus died the faithful and venerable Polycarp
3542,BOSTON,"in the year 168, at the age of eighty-six."

3575,BOSTON,The Frivolous King.
3576,BOSTON,
3577,BOSTON,
3578,BOSTON,"Richard the Second was grandson of Edward the Third, and the only son of"
3579,BOSTON,the celebrated Black Prince. He ascended the throne at the age of
3580,BOSTON,"eleven, with every advantage that could be derived from the partiality"
3581,BOSTON,of the people for his illustrious ancestors. Especially the firmness and
3582,BOSTON,"magnanimity of his father, and his union of goodness with greatness, won"
3583,BOSTON,"the favour of the historians of his times, who assert that he left a"
3584,BOSTON,stainless honour and an unblemished name.
3585,BOSTON,
3586,BOSTON,"The young king, during an insurrection, gave some proofs of courage and"
3587,BOSTON,presence of mind that impressed the nation favourably: and as he
3588,BOSTON,"approached maturity, his graceful, majestic person awakened their"
3589,BOSTON,admiration and pride. Had he by wise conduct and deportment confirmed
3590,BOSTON,"these impressions, he might have swayed their affections, and firmly"
3591,BOSTON,established himself in their love. But his demeanour was so light and
3592,BOSTON,"frivolous, that he commanded no respect, while his self-confidence and"
3593,BOSTON,contempt of wise counsel plunged him into misfortune. And as the mind
3594,BOSTON,"that indulges itself in error is never stationary, he passed from"
3595,BOSTON,"indolence to acts of injustice, and even of cruelty."
3596,BOSTON,
3597,BOSTON,"He banished for life the Duke of Norfolk, against whom no crime had been"
3598,BOSTON,"proved, and condemned to a ten years' exile the young Duke of"
3599,BOSTON,"Bolingbroke, against whom no offence had been alleged. The last named"
3600,BOSTON,"nobleman was his own cousin, the son of John of Gaunt, Duke of"
3601,BOSTON,"Lancaster, brother of the Black Prince. The aged father deeply mourned"
3602,BOSTON,this disgrace and unjust punishment inflicted on his only son. Had not
3603,BOSTON,"Richard been destitute of true sympathy, it would have grieved him to"
3604,BOSTON,"see his white-haired relative sinking in despondence, and mourning night"
3605,BOSTON,"and day for the absence of his son. Borne down by sorrow, and the"
3606,BOSTON,"infirmities of declining years, he died, and his large estates were"
3607,BOSTON,immediately taken for the use of the crown.
3608,BOSTON,
3609,BOSTON,"The banished Bolingbroke, exasperated at the seizure of his paternal"
3610,BOSTON,"inheritance, returned before the term of his exile had expired. When he"
3611,BOSTON,"entered his native land, some followers joined him, and as he passed"
3612,BOSTON,"onward, they increased to a formidable force. Richard was dilatory in"
3613,BOSTON,"his preparations to oppose them, and unfortunate in his encounters. He"
3614,BOSTON,"was defeated, and made prisoner by him who had once been the victim of"
3615,BOSTON,his own tyranny.
3616,BOSTON,
3617,BOSTON,"The weather was cold and cheerless, when, on almost the last day of"
3618,BOSTON,"December, 1399, a strange and sad scene was exhibited in the streets of"
3619,BOSTON,"London. There, Bolingbroke, with the title of Henry Fourth, appeared"
3620,BOSTON,"riding in great pomp, with a vast retinue, who filled the air with"
3621,BOSTON,"acclamations, followed by the drooping and degraded Richard, exposed to"
3622,BOSTON,"the insults of those who flattered or feared him in his day of power,"
3623,BOSTON,and now spared not to cast dust and rubbish upon him. Shakspeare has
3624,BOSTON,"given a most striking description of this entrance into the city, which"
3625,BOSTON,seems to bring it before the eye like a picture.
3626,BOSTON,
3627,BOSTON,Though the fickle throng showered their praises upon the fortunate
3628,BOSTON,"monarch, there were some left to pity the fallen. He was kept a close"
3629,BOSTON,"prisoner in Pomfret Castle, and subjected to many sufferings and"
3630,BOSTON,"indignities. There he died, some historians say by the stroke of an axe,"
3631,BOSTON,"and others, by the slow torture of starvation."
3632,BOSTON,
3633,BOSTON,"From his untimely grave, a voice seems to rise, warning the young"
3634,BOSTON,against the folly and rashness that were his ruin. Let them avoid this
3635,BOSTON,"thoughtlessness and waste of time, and if they are ever tempted to"
3636,BOSTON,"frivolity, or contempt of the rights of others, remember what this"
3637,BOSTON,"prince might have been, and what he became, nor pass by this melancholy"
3638,BOSTON,monument of blasted hope without learning a lesson of wisdom.

3670,BOSTON,
3671,BOSTON,
3672,BOSTON,The pomp with which royalty is surrounded must be unfavourable to a
3673,BOSTON,right education. Its proud expectations are often destructive to
3674,BOSTON,"humility, and its flatteries blind the mind to a knowledge of itself."
3675,BOSTON,
3676,BOSTON,"Yet History records a few instances, where the young heart has escaped"
3677,BOSTON,"these dangers, and chosen truth for its guide, and wisdom as its"
3678,BOSTON,"portion. Here and there, we find one, whom the possession of an earthly"
3679,BOSTON,crown did not deter from the pursuit of that which is incorruptible and
3680,BOSTON,eternal.
3681,BOSTON,
3682,BOSTON,"Josiah, the king of Judah, was one of these rare examples. He was born"
3683,BOSTON,"about the year six hundred and thirty-three, before the Christian era,"
3684,BOSTON,and at the early age of eight was called to succeed his father on the
3685,BOSTON,"throne. The temptations of kingly power, which are so often a hindrance"
3686,BOSTON,"to piety, seemed rather to dispose his heart to its influence, for the"
3687,BOSTON,"sacred historian records that in the eighth year of his reign, while he"
3688,BOSTON,"was yet young, ""he began to seek after the God of David his father."""
3689,BOSTON,
3690,BOSTON,The religion of this young prince of sixteen soon unfolded itself in
3691,BOSTON,"earnest deeds; the overthrow of idolatry, the repair of the Holy Temple,"
3692,BOSTON,and the establishment of laws for the welfare of his people and realm.
3693,BOSTON,
3694,BOSTON,"Modern history, also, describes some young heirs of royalty, whom it is"
3695,BOSTON,pleasant to contemplate. Conspicuous among these is Edward VI. of
3696,BOSTON,"England, who began his reign in 1547, at the age of nine years. His"
3697,BOSTON,"mother died almost immediately after his birth, and until he was nearly"
3698,BOSTON,"seven he was under the care of females, whose virtues and"
3699,BOSTON,accomplishments were calculated to make the happiest impression on his
3700,BOSTON,"character. Thus, by the grace of God, was laid the foundation of that"
3701,BOSTON,"deep, tender, and consistent piety, that marked his conduct through"
3702,BOSTON,"life, and left him, at death, an unblemished fame."
3703,BOSTON,
3704,BOSTON,"In early childhood he discovered strong powers of mind, and a"
3705,BOSTON,conscientious heart. His reverence for the Scriptures was remarkable.
3706,BOSTON,"Once, while playing with some infantine companions, he desired to reach"
3707,BOSTON,an article that was considerably above their heads. So they moved a
3708,BOSTON,large book for him to stand upon. Scarcely had he placed his foot upon
3709,BOSTON,"the covers when he saw it was the Bible. Instantly drawing back, he"
3710,BOSTON,"folded his arms around it and said seriously to his play-fellows, ""Shall"
3711,BOSTON,I trample under my feet that which God hath commanded me to treasure up
3712,BOSTON,"in my heart?"""
3713,BOSTON,
3714,BOSTON,"On his seventh birth-day he was placed under the tuition of learned men,"
3715,BOSTON,"to study such branches of knowledge as they considered best for him,"
3716,BOSTON,among which were the Latin and French languages. He was docile to all
3717,BOSTON,"their directions, and frequently expressed his gratitude for their"
3718,BOSTON,"instructions. Letters elegantly written in Latin, at the age of eight,"
3719,BOSTON,"to his father, Henry Eighth, Queen Catharine Parr, his mother-in-law,"
3720,BOSTON,"and the Earl of Hertford, his uncle, are preserved as curiosities in the"
3721,BOSTON,annals of those times.
3722,BOSTON,
3723,BOSTON,"At his coronation, being then nine years old, three swords were laid"
3724,BOSTON,before him to signify that he was the monarch of three separate
3725,BOSTON,kingdoms.
3726,BOSTON,
3727,BOSTON,"""There is another sword yet wanting,"" said the child-prince, ""one more,"
3728,BOSTON,"the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Without that we are"
3729,BOSTON,"nothing, we can do nothing; we have no power. Through that, we are what"
3730,BOSTON,"we are, at this day. From that Book alone, we obtain all virtue and"
3731,BOSTON,"salvation, and whatever we have of divine strength."""
3732,BOSTON,
3733,BOSTON,Constancy and regularity in prayer was among his early traits of
3734,BOSTON,"character. After he became a king, and was subject to the interruptions"
3735,BOSTON,"and temptations of a court, nothing could induce him to neglect his"
3736,BOSTON,"daily seasons of private devotion. One day, he was told, that Sir John"
3737,BOSTON,"Cheeke, who had given him lessons in Latin, when quite a young child,"
3738,BOSTON,"was dangerously sick. With deep solemnity on his countenance, he went to"
3739,BOSTON,"his stated retirement, and afterwards hearing that the physician had"
3740,BOSTON,"said there was little hope of his recovery, replied in the simple"
3741,BOSTON,"fervour of faith,"
3742,BOSTON,
3743,BOSTON,"""Ah! but I think there is. For I have most earnestly begged of God, in"
3744,BOSTON,"my prayers, this morning, to spare him."""
3745,BOSTON,
3746,BOSTON,"When the sufferer was restored to health, and informed of this"
3747,BOSTON,"circumstance, he was deeply touched by the grateful affection and"
3748,BOSTON,confiding piety of his royal pupil.
3749,BOSTON,
3750,BOSTON,Edward Sixth kept an exact diary of all the memorable events that passed
3751,BOSTON,"under his observation. The conferring of every office, civil or"
3752,BOSTON,"ecclesiastical, the receipts and expenditure of the revenue, the repairs"
3753,BOSTON,"or erection of forts, the sending forth or reception of ambassadors, and"
3754,BOSTON,"indeed, all matters of business that occurred during his reign, were"
3755,BOSTON,"legibly recorded by his own hand, with their appropriate dates. This"
3756,BOSTON,"diary, which evinces industry and uprightness of purpose, is often"
3757,BOSTON,quoted by historians.
3758,BOSTON,
3759,BOSTON,"But pulmonary consumption early made fatal inroads on his health, and he"
3760,BOSTON,prepared for a higher and happier state with the benignity of one whose
3761,BOSTON,"heart was already there. The following prayer, which is among those"
3762,BOSTON,"which he used as the close of life drew nigh, will show how much the"
3763,BOSTON,"progress of true religion among his people dwelt on his mind, when about"
3764,BOSTON,to be taken from them:
3765,BOSTON,
3766,BOSTON,"""My Lord God! if thou wilt deliver me from this miserable and wretched"
3767,BOSTON,"life, take me among thy chosen. Yet, not _my_ will, but _Thy_ will be"
3768,BOSTON,done. Lord I commit my spirit unto Thee. Thou knowest how happy it were
3769,BOSTON,"for me to be with Thee. But if Thou dost send me life and health, grant"
3770,BOSTON,that I may more truly serve Thee.
3771,BOSTON,
3772,BOSTON,"""Oh my God! save thy people, and bless thine inheritance. Preserve thy"
3773,BOSTON,"chosen realm of England, and maintain Thy true religion, that both king"
3774,BOSTON,"and people may praise Thy holy name, for the sake of our Lord Jesus"
3775,BOSTON,"Christ."""
3776,BOSTON,
3777,BOSTON,"Edward Sixth died at the age of sixteen, July 6th, 1553, beloved and"
3778,BOSTON,lamented by all over whom he had reigned.
3779,BOSTON,
3780,BOSTON,"The historians of France record, with high encomium, the virtues of one"
3781,BOSTON,"of their princes, a son of Louis Fifteenth, who died before his father."
3782,BOSTON,"He possessed a noble spirit, amiable manners, and in all the duties and"
3783,BOSTON,"sympathies of private life was so exemplary, that he was pronounced by"
3784,BOSTON,"national enthusiasm, ""too perfect to continue on earth."" He was"
3785,BOSTON,"exceedingly attentive to the education of his children, and vigilant in"
3786,BOSTON,guarding them against the pride and arrogance of royalty. He continually
3787,BOSTON,"endeavoured to impress upon their minds, that though they had been"
3788,BOSTON,"placed by Heaven in an elevated station, yet virtue and religion were"
3789,BOSTON,"the only true and enduring distinctions. His death, which was deeply"
3790,BOSTON,"mourned by the nation over which he had expected one day to rule, took"
3791,BOSTON,"place on the 20th of December, 1765, when he had just attained the age"
3792,BOSTON,of thirty-seven years.
3793,BOSTON,
3794,BOSTON,He directed the preceptor of his children to take them to the abodes of
3795,BOSTON,"the poor, and let them taste the coarsest bread, and lie down upon the"
3796,BOSTON,"hardest pallet, that they might know how the needy live, and learn to"
3797,BOSTON,pity them.
3798,BOSTON,
3799,BOSTON,"""Ah! suffer them also to weep,"" he would say, ""for a prince who has"

3802,BOSTON,"Yes, take them to the peasant's cot,"

3809,BOSTON,"Where want and weary labour pine,"
3810,BOSTON,"Diseased, unpitied, and unfed;"
3811,BOSTON,
3812,BOSTON,And let them weep; for if their eyes
3813,BOSTON,"With tender Pity ne'er o'erflow,"
3814,BOSTON,"How will they heed their subjects' signs,"
3815,BOSTON,Or learn to feel a nation's woe?
3816,BOSTON,

3833,BOSTON,
3834,BOSTON,
3835,BOSTON,You will perhaps say they have been from the beginning. The history of
3836,BOSTON,every nation tells of the shedding of blood. In the Bible and other
3837,BOSTON,"ancient records of man, we read of ""wars and fightings,"" ever since he"
3838,BOSTON,was placed upon the earth.
3839,BOSTON,
3840,BOSTON,Yet there have been always some to lament that the creatures whom God
3841,BOSTON,has made should thus destroy each other. They have felt that human life
3842,BOSTON,"was short enough, without its being made still shorter by violence."
3843,BOSTON,Among the most warlike nations there have been wise and reflecting
3844,BOSTON,"minds, who felt that war was an evil, and deplored it as a judgment."
3845,BOSTON,
3846,BOSTON,Rome was one of the most warlike nations of the ancient world. Yet three
3847,BOSTON,"of her best Emperors gave their testimony against war, and were most"
3848,BOSTON,"reluctant to engage in it. Adrian truly loved peace, and endeavoured to"
3849,BOSTON,promote it. He saw that war was a foe to those arts and sciences which
3850,BOSTON,cause nations to prosper. Titus Antoninus Pius tried to live in peace
3851,BOSTON,"with every one. He did all in his power to prevent war, and said he"
3852,BOSTON,"would ""rather save the life of one citizen, than destroy a thousand"
3853,BOSTON,"enemies."" Marcus Aurelius considered war both as a disgrace and a"
3854,BOSTON,"calamity. When he was forced into it, his heart revolted."
3855,BOSTON,
3856,BOSTON,"Yet these were heathen emperors. They had never received the Gospel,"
3857,BOSTON,"which breathes ""peace and good-will to man."" The law of Moses did not"
3858,BOSTON,"forbid war ""An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,"" was the maxim"
3859,BOSTON,"of the Jewish people. But the law of Jesus Christ is a law of peace. ""I"
3860,BOSTON,"say unto you, that ye resist not evil,"" were the words not only of his"
3861,BOSTON,"lips, but of his example. His command to his disciples was, ""See that ye"
3862,BOSTON,"love one another."""
3863,BOSTON,
3864,BOSTON,"The spirit of war, therefore, was not condemned by the Jewish law, or by"
3865,BOSTON,the creeds of the heathen. But it is contrary to the spirit of the
3866,BOSTON,Gospel.
3867,BOSTON,
3868,BOSTON,Have you ever seriously considered the evil and sorrow of war? how it
3869,BOSTON,"destroys the lives of multitudes, and makes bitter mourning in families"
3870,BOSTON,"and nations? You are sorry when you see a friend suffering pain, or a"
3871,BOSTON,"lame man with a broken bone, or even a child with a cut finger. But"
3872,BOSTON,"after a battle, what gashes and gaping wounds are seen, while the ground"
3873,BOSTON,"is red with the flowing blood, and the dying in their agony are trampled"
3874,BOSTON,"under the feet of horses, or covered with heaps of dead bodies."
3875,BOSTON,
3876,BOSTON,"Think too of the poverty and distress that come upon many families, who"
3877,BOSTON,"have lost the friend whose labour provided them with bread, upon the"
3878,BOSTON,mourning of gray-headed parents from whose feeble limbs the prop is
3879,BOSTON,taken away; upon the anguish of wives for their slaughtered husbands;
3880,BOSTON,"and the weeping of children, because their dear fathers must return to"
3881,BOSTON,them no more.
3882,BOSTON,
3883,BOSTON,"All these evils, and many which there is not room to mention, come from"
3884,BOSTON,a single battle. But in one war there are often many battles. Towns are
3885,BOSTON,"sometimes burned, and the aged and helpless destroyed. The mother and"
3886,BOSTON,her innocent babes perish in the flames of their own beloved homes.
3887,BOSTON,
3888,BOSTON,It is very sad to think of the cruelty and bad passions which war
3889,BOSTON,"produces. Men, who have no cause to dislike each other, meet as deadly"
3890,BOSTON,"foes. They raise weapons of destruction, and exult to hear the groans of"
3891,BOSTON,"death. Rulers who make war, should remember the suffering and sin which"
3892,BOSTON,"it occasions, and how much more noble it is to save life than to destroy"
3893,BOSTON,it.
3894,BOSTON,
3895,BOSTON,"Howard visited the prisons of Europe, and relieved the miseries of those"
3896,BOSTON,"who had no helper, and died with their blessings on his head. Bonaparte"
3897,BOSTON,"caused multitudes to be slain, and multitudes to mourn, and died like a"
3898,BOSTON,chained lion upon a desolate island. Is not the fame of Howard better
3899,BOSTON,than that of Bonaparte?
3900,BOSTON,
3901,BOSTON,"The religious sect of Friends, or Quakers, as they are sometimes called,"
3902,BOSTON,never go to war. The beautiful State of Pennsylvania was originally
3903,BOSTON,"settled by them. William Penn, its founder, would not permit any discord"
3904,BOSTON,"with the Indians, its original inhabitants. He obtained the land of them"
3905,BOSTON,"by fair purchase, and set the example of treating them with justice and"
3906,BOSTON,courtesy.
3907,BOSTON,
3908,BOSTON,In most of the other colonies there had been fearful wars with the
3909,BOSTON,"savages. In ambush and massacre, the blood of the new-comers had been"
3910,BOSTON,shed; and they had retaliated on the sons of the forest with terrible
3911,BOSTON,vengeance. Older States looked upon this proffer of peace as a dangerous
3912,BOSTON,"experiment. They said, ""These Quakers have put their heads under the"
3913,BOSTON,"tomahawk."" But on the contrary, no drop of their blood was ever shed by"
3914,BOSTON,the Indians in Pennsylvania. They gathered around William Penn with
3915,BOSTON,"reverence and love. Rude warriors as they were, they admired his"
3916,BOSTON,"peaceful spirit. He explained his views to them with cordiality, and"
3917,BOSTON,they listened to his words.
3918,BOSTON,
3919,BOSTON,"""We will not fight with you,"" he said, ""nor shed your blood. If a"
3920,BOSTON,"quarrel arise, six of our people and six of your own, shall meet"
3921,BOSTON,"together and judge what is right, and settle the matter accordingly."""
3922,BOSTON,
3923,BOSTON,"Subdued by his spirit of kindness and truth, they promised to live in"
3924,BOSTON,"peace with him and his posterity ""so long as the sun and moon shall"
3925,BOSTON,"endure."""
3926,BOSTON,
3927,BOSTON,"On his return to England, among the friends who gathered around the ship"
3928,BOSTON,"to bid him farewell, were groups of Indians with mournful brows, the"
3929,BOSTON,"women holding up their little ones, that they might have one more sight"
3930,BOSTON,"of the great and good man, whom they called their Father. Was not this"
3931,BOSTON,"more acceptable to Heaven than the din of strife, and the false glory of"
3932,BOSTON,the conqueror?
3933,BOSTON,
3934,BOSTON,So earnest was William Penn to convince his fellowmen that it was both
3935,BOSTON,"their duty and privilege to live in peace, that he travelled into"
3936,BOSTON,"foreign countries for that purpose, using his eloquence, and knowledge"
3937,BOSTON,"of various languages with considerable success. Peter the Great, when"
3938,BOSTON,"studying the arts of civilization in England, was much interested by"
3939,BOSTON,"visits from this teacher of Peace, who conversed fluently with him in"
3940,BOSTON,"German. The young Czar listened with great attention and courtesy, while"
3941,BOSTON,he unfolded his system. He then earnestly requested that it might be
3942,BOSTON,"expressed for him in a few words, and William Penn wrote,"
3943,BOSTON,
3944,BOSTON,"""Men must be holy, or they cannot be happy; they should be few in words,"
3945,BOSTON,"peaceable in life, suffer wrongs, love enemies, and deny themselves:"
3946,BOSTON,"without which, faith is false; worship, formality, and religion,"
3947,BOSTON,"hypocrisy."""
3948,BOSTON,
3949,BOSTON,"The future Emperor of the Russians, though not a convert to the doctrine"
3950,BOSTON,"of the Quakers, regarded it with so much respect, that he repeatedly"
3951,BOSTON,"attended their meetings, evincing deep and interested attention. To his"
3952,BOSTON,"mind, the theory of peace seemed beautiful, yet he considered it"
3953,BOSTON,impossible that wars should be prevented. He did not believe that
3954,BOSTON,contending nations could be made to settle their differences without an
3955,BOSTON,"appeal to arms, or that their anger might be soothed by the mediation of"
3956,BOSTON,"a friendly people, as a good man makes peace between offended"
3957,BOSTON,neighbours. It did not occur to him that a Christian ruler might mediate
3958,BOSTON,with the soothing policy of the patriarch Abraham to his wrathful
3959,BOSTON,kinsman:
3960,BOSTON,
3961,BOSTON,"""Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, or between my"

3972,BOSTON,As the rope saves the drowning mariner.
3973,BOSTON,"I thought at first the luckless wight was dead,"
3974,BOSTON,"But mark'd a quivering of the slender limbs,"
3975,BOSTON,"And laid him on a paper in the sun,"
3976,BOSTON,To renovate himself.
3977,BOSTON,With sudden spasm
3978,BOSTON,"Convulsion shook him sore, and on his back"
3979,BOSTON,"Discomfited he lay. Then, by his side"
3980,BOSTON,"I strew'd some sugar, and upon his breast"
3981,BOSTON,"Arrang'd a particle, thinking, perchance,"
3982,BOSTON,The odour of his favourite aliment
3983,BOSTON,"Might stimulate the palate, and uncoil"
3984,BOSTON,The folded trunk.
3985,BOSTON,"But, straight, a troop of friends"
3986,BOSTON,"Gather'd around him, and I deem'd it kind"
3987,BOSTON,"To express their sympathy, in such dark hour"
3988,BOSTON,"Of adverse fortune. Yet, behold! they came"
3989,BOSTON,"To forage on his stores, and rudely turn'd"
3990,BOSTON,"And toss'd him o'er and o'er, to help themselves"
3991,BOSTON,With more convenience. Quite incens'd to see
3992,BOSTON,"Their utter want of pitying courtesy,"
3993,BOSTON,"I drove these venal people all away,"
3994,BOSTON,"And shut a wine-glass o'er him, to exclude"
3995,BOSTON,Their coarse intrusion.
3996,BOSTON,"Forthwith, they return'd,"
3997,BOSTON,"And through his palace peer'd, and, round and round"
3998,BOSTON,"Gadding, admission sought: yet all in vain."
3999,BOSTON,"And so, a wondrous buzzing they set up,"
4000,BOSTON,"As if with envy mov'd to see him there,"
4001,BOSTON,"The untasted luxury at his very lips,"
4002,BOSTON,For which they long'd so much.
4003,BOSTON,"Then suddenly,"
4004,BOSTON,"The prisoner mov'd his head, and rose with pain,"
4005,BOSTON,"And dragg'd his palsied body slow along,"
4006,BOSTON,"Marking out sinuous lines, as on a map,"
4007,BOSTON,"Coast, islet, creek, and lithe promontory,"
4008,BOSTON,"Blank as the Stygian ink-pool, where he plung'd"
4009,BOSTON,So foolishly. But a nice bath was made
4010,BOSTON,"In a small silver spoon, from which he rose"
4011,BOSTON,"Most marvellously chang'd, stretching outright"
4012,BOSTON,"All his six legs uncramp'd, and, opening wide"
4013,BOSTON,"And shutting with delight his gauzy wings,"
4014,BOSTON,Seem'd to applaud the cleansing properties
4015,BOSTON,"Of pure cold water. Then with appetite,"

4017,BOSTON,And in this renovation of the life
4018,BOSTON,"Of a poor noteless insect, was a joy,"
4019,BOSTON,"And sweet content, I never could have felt"

4032,BOSTON,
4033,BOSTON,"Jacob Bicks was a native of Leyden, in Holland, and born in the year"
4034,BOSTON,"1657. His parents were religious, and gave strict attention to his early"
4035,BOSTON,"education, and their efforts were rewarded. He became tenderly"
4036,BOSTON,"conscientious, and in all his conduct sought to obey them and please"
4037,BOSTON,God.
4038,BOSTON,
4039,BOSTON,"When the plague raged in Holland, in 1664, he was seized with the fatal"
4040,BOSTON,"infection. At first he seemed drowsy and lethargic, but during his"
4041,BOSTON,"waking intervals, was observed to be engaged in prayer."
4042,BOSTON,
4043,BOSTON,"""This,"" said he, ""gives me comfort in my distress."""
4044,BOSTON,
4045,BOSTON,"Perceiving that he suffered pain, he was asked if he would like again to"
4046,BOSTON,see the physician.
4047,BOSTON,
4048,BOSTON,"""No,"" he earnestly answered, ""I wish to have him no more. The Lord will"

4050,BOSTON,
4051,BOSTON,"""Dear child,"" said his father, ""this grieves us to the heart."""

4053,BOSTON,"""Father,"" answered the meek sufferer, ""let us pray. The Lord will be"
4054,BOSTON,"near for my helper."""
4055,BOSTON,
4056,BOSTON,"After prayer, he spoke with a stronger and more joyful voice, his"
4057,BOSTON,"parting words,"
4058,BOSTON,
4059,BOSTON,"""Come now, father and mother, come and kiss me, I feel that I am to die."
4060,BOSTON,"Farewell, dear parents, farewell, dear sister, farewell all. Now shall I"

4067,BOSTON,
4068,BOSTON,"""God will be near thee,"" said the father. ""He shall uphold thee."""
4069,BOSTON,
4070,BOSTON,"""It is written,"" answered the child, ""that He giveth grace unto the"

4073,BOSTON,
4074,BOSTON,"""Hast thou indeed, so strong a faith, my dear son?"" asked the afflicted"

4076,BOSTON,
4077,BOSTON,"""Yes,"" said the dying boy, ""He hath given me this strong faith in Jesus"

4082,BOSTON,
4083,BOSTON,"Then, with his failing breath, they heard upon his lips the softly"
4084,BOSTON,"murmured prayer, ""Lord, be merciful to me a poor sinner,"" as with a"
4085,BOSTON,"trusting smile his spirit passed away, just as he had completed his"
4086,BOSTON,seventh year.
4087,BOSTON,
4088,BOSTON,"His sister, Susanna, seven years older than himself, was smitten by the"
4089,BOSTON,"same terrible pestilence, a few weeks after his death. She had been from"
4090,BOSTON,"the beginning a child of great sweetness of disposition, attentive to"
4091,BOSTON,"her studies, and so faithful in her religious duties as to be considered"
4092,BOSTON,"an example for other young persons, and even for older Christians."
4093,BOSTON,
4094,BOSTON,"Bending beneath the anguish of her disease, like a crushed and beautiful"

4121,BOSTON,
4122,BOSTON,"Fatigued with speaking, she fell into a deep slumber, and on awaking,"

4132,BOSTON,
4133,BOSTON,"She had a peculiarly warm and grateful love for her teachers and pastor,"
4134,BOSTON,and a veneration for all ministers of the Gospel. She delighted to
4135,BOSTON,"listen to their conversation wherever she met them, and counted any"
4136,BOSTON,"attention from them as an honour. But now, she would not consent that"
4137,BOSTON,"they should approach her, lest they might take the fearful disease that"
4138,BOSTON,was hurrying her to the tomb.
4139,BOSTON,
4140,BOSTON,"""I will not expose their valuable lives,"" she said. ""I cast myself"
4141,BOSTON,"wholly upon the mercies of God. His word is my comforter."""
4142,BOSTON,
4143,BOSTON,Her knowledge of the Scriptures was uncommon. She had committed large
4144,BOSTON,"portions of it to memory, which gave hallowed themes to her meditation,"
4145,BOSTON,"and naturally mingled with her discourse in these solemn, parting"
4146,BOSTON,moments.
4147,BOSTON,
4148,BOSTON,"She felt a deep desire for the progress of true religion, whose worth"
4149,BOSTON,she was now able more fully to appreciate than in the days of health.

4152,BOSTON,
4153,BOSTON,"""Have I not cause to weep? Our dear minister was taken ill in his pulpit"

4157,BOSTON,
4158,BOSTON,"She had shed no tear for her own severe pains, but she bemoaned the"

4178,BOSTON,"Her parents, surprised and moved at a piety so far beyond her years,"
4179,BOSTON,could not refrain from a strong burst of tears at the affliction that
4180,BOSTON,"awaited them in her loss. Greatly grieved at their sorrow, she soothed"
4181,BOSTON,them and argued with them against its indulgence.
4182,BOSTON,
4183,BOSTON,"""Oh! why should you so weep over me? Is it not the good Lord that takes"
4184,BOSTON,"me out of this miserable world? Shall it not be well with me, through"

4186,BOSTON,"and doeth whatsoever he pleaseth? Do you not pray every day, that His"
4187,BOSTON,will may be done? Should we not be content when our prayers are

4192,BOSTON,
4193,BOSTON,She then spoke of the plague that was raging throughout the country with
4194,BOSTON,"violence, and said she chose to consider it as the especial allotment of"
4195,BOSTON,"the Almighty, and not, as some supposed, the result of disorder in the"

4197,BOSTON,
4198,BOSTON,"""This is the day appointed for explaining the first question in the"

4201,BOSTON,"comforted, for whether I live or die, I am his. Oh! why do you afflict"
4202,BOSTON,"yourselves so? Yet, with weeping came I into this world, and with"
4203,BOSTON,"weeping must I go out. But, dear parents, better is the day of my death,"
4204,BOSTON,"than the day of my birth."""
4205,BOSTON,
4206,BOSTON,She requested her father to go to those who had instructed her in

4208,BOSTON,"child, and tell them how precious was the memory of their words, now in"
4209,BOSTON,"the time of her extreme distress. She desired, also, that her gratitude"
4210,BOSTON,"might be expressed to those who had taught her, when very young, to read"
4211,BOSTON,"and work, and to all who had at any time shown her kindness and"
4212,BOSTON,attention. When he told her of the satisfaction he had enjoyed in her
4213,BOSTON,"proficiency in the various branches she had pursued, especially in her"
4214,BOSTON,"study of the Bible, her readiness to express her thoughts in writing,"
4215,BOSTON,"her constant filial obedience, and reverence for the ordinances of"

4217,BOSTON,
4218,BOSTON,"""I bless God for granting me the means of education, and the example of"

4221,BOSTON,"comfort that the world could never have afforded."""
4222,BOSTON,
4223,BOSTON,"""My child,"" said her mournful father, ""I perceive that you are very"

4229,BOSTON,"of the Lord, for his mercies are great.'"""
4230,BOSTON,
4231,BOSTON,"She besought her parents not to indulge in immoderate grief, when she"
4232,BOSTON,"should be taken away. She adduced the example of the King of Israel, who"
4233,BOSTON,"after the death of his child, arose, and took refreshment, saying, ""He"
4234,BOSTON,"is dead. Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not"
4235,BOSTON,"return to me."" So ought you to say, when I am no longer here, 'Our"
4236,BOSTON,"child is well.' Dear mother, who has done so much for me, promise me"
4237,BOSTON,"this one thing before I die, not to sorrow too much for me. I am afraid"
4238,BOSTON,of your great affliction. Consider other losses. Remember Job. Forget

4240,BOSTON,"be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.'"""
4241,BOSTON,
4242,BOSTON,"While thus comforting those whom she loved out of the Scriptures, it"
4243,BOSTON,"seemed as if she herself attained greater confidence of faith, for she"
4244,BOSTON,exclaimed with a joyful voice:
4245,BOSTON,

4247,BOSTON,"life, nor death, nor angels, principalities, nor powers, nor things"

4249,BOSTON,"creature. Behold, Death is swallowed up in victory."""
4250,BOSTON,
4251,BOSTON,"Afterwards, she spoke of the shortness of human life, quoting passages"
4252,BOSTON,"from the Bible, and of the necessary law of our nature, appointing that"
4253,BOSTON,"all who are born must die. Wisdom far beyond her years, flowed from her"
4254,BOSTON,"lips, for she had early sat at the feet of Jesus, and learned his holy"
4255,BOSTON,word.
4256,BOSTON,
4257,BOSTON,"""And now, what shall I say? I cannot continue long, for I feel much"
4258,BOSTON,"weakness. O Lord, look upon me graciously, have pity upon me. I know"
4259,BOSTON,"that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon"
4260,BOSTON,"the earth. Dearest parents, we must shortly part. My speech faileth me."
4261,BOSTON,"Pray for a quiet close to my combat."""
4262,BOSTON,
4263,BOSTON,"She expressed, at various times during her sickness, the most earnest"
4264,BOSTON,"solicitude for the souls of many of her relatives, solemnly requesting"
4265,BOSTON,and enforcing that her young sister should be religiously educated.
4266,BOSTON,"Throwing her emaciated arms around her, she embraced her with great"
4267,BOSTON,"affection, and desired that the babe of six months old might be brought"
4268,BOSTON,"her once more. With many kisses she took her last farewell, and those"
4269,BOSTON,who stood around the bed were greatly affected at the tender parting of
4270,BOSTON,these affectionate children.
4271,BOSTON,
4272,BOSTON,"""I go,"" said the dying one, ""to heaven, where we shall find each other"
4273,BOSTON,"again. I go to Jesus Christ. I go to my dear brother, who did so much"
4274,BOSTON,"cry and call upon God, to the last moment of his breath. I go to my"
4275,BOSTON,"little sister, who was but three years old when she died. Yet when we"
4276,BOSTON,"asked her if she would die, she answered, 'Yes, if it be the Lord's"
4277,BOSTON,"will: or I will stay with my mother, if it be His will; but yet, I know"
4278,BOSTON,that I shall die and go to heaven and to God.' Oh! see how so small a
4279,BOSTON,"babe could behave itself so submissively to the will of God, as if it"
4280,BOSTON,"had no will of its own. Therefore, dear father and mother, give the Lord"
4281,BOSTON,thanks for this his free and rich grace: and then I shall the more
4282,BOSTON,"gladly be gone. Be gracious, then, O Lord, unto me, also: be gracious"
4283,BOSTON,"unto me. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my"
4284,BOSTON,"sin."""
4285,BOSTON,
4286,BOSTON,"Prayer was offered for her, and her spirit seemed anew refreshed with a"
4287,BOSTON,sense of pardon and reconciliation to her Father in heaven. She
4288,BOSTON,conversed with pleasure of the last sermon that she had been permitted
4289,BOSTON,"to hear in the house of God, little supposing at that time, her mortal"
4290,BOSTON,"sickness was so near. With surprising accuracy, she quoted several texts"
4291,BOSTON,"that had been used in the different parts of that discourse, proving"
4292,BOSTON,"with what profound attention she had listened, and how perfectly her"
4293,BOSTON,retentive powers were preserved to the last.
4294,BOSTON,
4295,BOSTON,"She lay some time, absorbed in mental devotion, and then raising her"
4296,BOSTON,"head from her feverish pillow, besought her parents to forgive the"
4297,BOSTON,"errors of her childhood, and every occasion throughout her whole life,"
4298,BOSTON,"wherein she had grieved them or given them trouble. Then, with a clear"
4299,BOSTON,"judgment, she addressed herself to the only unfinished business of"
4300,BOSTON,"earth, the distribution of her books and other articles that she had"
4301,BOSTON,"considered her own. To her little brother she made an earnest request,"
4302,BOSTON,"that he would never part with the copy of 'Lectures on the Catechism,'"
4303,BOSTON,"that she gave him, but study it faithfully for her sake, and in"
4304,BOSTON,remembrance of her. Being seized with a sharp and severe pain in her
4305,BOSTON,"breast, she said that she felt assured her last hour drew nigh. Her"
4306,BOSTON,"parents, suppressing their grief, repeated their hope and trust, that"
4307,BOSTON,God would support her in the last dread extremity.
4308,BOSTON,
4309,BOSTON,"In a dying voice, yet clear and animated by unswerving faith, she"
4310,BOSTON,"replied,"
4311,BOSTON,
4312,BOSTON,"""He is my shepherd. Though I walk through the dark valley of the shadow"
4313,BOSTON,"of death, shall I fear when _He_ comforteth me? The sufferings of this"
4314,BOSTON,present life are not worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be
4315,BOSTON,revealed.
4316,BOSTON,
4317,BOSTON,"My end approacheth. Now shall I put on white raiment, and be clothed"
4318,BOSTON,before the Lamb with a spotless righteousness. Angels are ready to carry
4319,BOSTON,"me to the throne of God."" Her last words were,"
4320,BOSTON,
4321,BOSTON,"""Lord God, into thy hands, I commend my spirit. Oh Lord! be gracious, be"
4322,BOSTON,"merciful to me a poor sinner."""
4323,BOSTON,
4324,BOSTON,"Thus fell asleep, on the evening of the first of September, 1664, at the"
4325,BOSTON,"early age of fourteen, one, who for profound knowledge of the pages of"
4326,BOSTON,"Inspiration, judgment in applying them, love of their spirit, and faith"
4327,BOSTON,"in their promises, might serve as an example not only to those of her"
4328,BOSTON,"own age, but to Christians of hoary hairs. This good brother and sister"

4343,BOSTON,
4344,BOSTON,One only unfulfilled desire

4348,BOSTON,

4350,BOSTON,"Heaven heard the tender claim,"

4352,BOSTON,The absent mother came;
4353,BOSTON,

4364,BOSTON,
4365,BOSTON,"Those who have extended to lonely orphan hearts the protection of home,"
4366,BOSTON,"and a fostering kindness, are often repaid by the most tender and"
4367,BOSTON,grateful affections. A peculiarly striking instance of this kind
4368,BOSTON,"occurred in the case of an adopted niece of the Rev. John Newton, of"
4369,BOSTON,"London, England. Suddenly bereaved of her parents and an only brother,"
4370,BOSTON,"she found the arms of sympathizing relatives open to receive her, as a"
4371,BOSTON,trust and a treasure. She had just entered her twelfth year when she
4372,BOSTON,"came to them, and was possessed of an agreeable person, a lively"
4373,BOSTON,"disposition, with a quick and inventive genius. Her judgment and sense"
4374,BOSTON,"of propriety were advanced beyond her years, but her most endearing"
4375,BOSTON,qualities were sweetness of temper and a heart formed for the exercise
4376,BOSTON,"of gratitude and friendship. No cloud was seen upon her countenance, and"
4377,BOSTON,"when it was necessary to overrule her wishes, she acquiesced with a"
4378,BOSTON,smile.
4379,BOSTON,
4380,BOSTON,"To her uncle and aunt, her returns of affection were ardent and"
4381,BOSTON,"touching. She was watchful not to offend, or interfere with their"
4382,BOSTON,"convenience in the slightest degree, and often said, with her peculiarly"
4383,BOSTON,"sweet tones, ""I should be very ungrateful if I thought any pleasure"
4384,BOSTON,"equal to that of pleasing you."""
4385,BOSTON,
4386,BOSTON,"Her health, which had been for some time frail, began, in a year or"
4387,BOSTON,"two, sensibly to decline, with marked hectic symptoms. Whenever she was"
4388,BOSTON,"able, she patiently employed herself with her needle or book, her guitar"
4389,BOSTON,"or harpsichord. Though she knew no hour of perfect ease, she was"
4390,BOSTON,"remarkably placid and cheerful, and attentive to the wishes and comfort"
4391,BOSTON,of others. If at any time the severity of pain caused a silent tear to
4392,BOSTON,"steal down her cheek, and she saw that her uncle or aunt observed it,"
4393,BOSTON,"she would instantly turn to them with a smile or kiss, and say,"
4394,BOSTON,
4395,BOSTON,"""Do not be uneasy. I am not so very ill. I can bear it. I shall be"
4396,BOSTON,"better presently."""
4397,BOSTON,
4398,BOSTON,Her religious education had been early attended to by her parents; and
4399,BOSTON,"the excellent relatives who supplied their place, saw with the deepest"
4400,BOSTON,"gratitude the strengthening of her faith, for support in the season of"
4401,BOSTON,"trial. She said to her aunt,"
4402,BOSTON,
4403,BOSTON,"""I have long and earnestly sought the Lord, with reference to the change"
4404,BOSTON,"that is now approaching. I trust He will fit me for himself, and then,"
4405,BOSTON,"whether sooner or later, it signifies but little."""
4406,BOSTON,
4407,BOSTON,"Sufferings the most acute were appointed her, which medical skill was"
4408,BOSTON,unwearied in its attempts to mitigate. To her attentive physician who
4409,BOSTON,"expressed his regret one morning, at finding her more feeble than on the"
4410,BOSTON,"previous day, she replied,"
4411,BOSTON,
4412,BOSTON,"""I trust all will be well soon."""
4413,BOSTON,
4414,BOSTON,"Her spirit was uniformly peaceful, and her chief attention of an earthly"
4415,BOSTON,nature seemed directed to the consolation of those who were distressed
4416,BOSTON,"at her sufferings. The servants, who waited on her from love, both night"
4417,BOSTON,"and day, she repeatedly thanked in the most fervent manner, adding her"
4418,BOSTON,"prayer that God would reward them. To her most constant attendant, she"
4419,BOSTON,"said,"
4420,BOSTON,
4421,BOSTON,"""Be sure to call upon the Lord. If you think He does not hear you now,"
4422,BOSTON,"He will at last. So it has been with me."""
4423,BOSTON,
4424,BOSTON,"As the last hours of life drew nigh, she had many paroxysms of agony."
4425,BOSTON,"But her heart rested on the Redeemer. To one who inquired how she was,"
4426,BOSTON,"she sweetly answered,"
4427,BOSTON,
4428,BOSTON,"""Truly happy. And if this is dying, it is a pleasant thing to die."""
4429,BOSTON,
4430,BOSTON,"In the course of her illness, to the question of her friends if she"
4431,BOSTON,"desired to be restored and to live long, she would reply, ""Not for the"
4432,BOSTON,"world,"" and sometimes, ""Not for a thousand worlds."" But as she"
4433,BOSTON,"approached the verge of heaven, her own will seemed wholly absorbed in"
4434,BOSTON,"the Divine Will, and to this inquiry she meekly answered,"
4435,BOSTON,
4436,BOSTON,"""I desire to have no choice."""
4437,BOSTON,
4438,BOSTON,"For the text of her funeral sermon, she chose, ""Blessed are the dead who"
4439,BOSTON,"die in the Lord,"" and also selected an appropriate hymn to be sung on"
4440,BOSTON,"that occasion. ""Do not weep for me, dear aunt,"" she tenderly said, ""but"
4441,BOSTON,"rather rejoice, and give praise on my account."""
4442,BOSTON,
4443,BOSTON,"As the close of her last day on earth approached, she desired to hear"
4444,BOSTON,"once more the voice of prayer. Her affectionate uncle, who cherished for"
4445,BOSTON,"her the love of a father, poured out his soul fervently at the Throne of"
4446,BOSTON,"Grace. Her lips, already white in death, clearly pronounced ""Amen,"" and"
4447,BOSTON,"soon after added, ""Why are his chariot-wheels so long in coming? Yet I"
4448,BOSTON,"hope he will enable me to wait His hour with patience."""
4449,BOSTON,
4450,BOSTON,"Fixing her eyes on her mourning aunt, it seemed as if the last trace of"
4451,BOSTON,"earthly anxiety that she was destined to feel, was on her account. To"
4452,BOSTON,"one near her pillow, she said in a gentle whisper."
4453,BOSTON,
4454,BOSTON,"""Try to persuade my aunt to leave the room. I think I shall soon sleep."
4455,BOSTON,"I shall not remain with you until the morning."""
4456,BOSTON,
4457,BOSTON,No. Her morning was to be where there is no sunset. All pain was for her
4458,BOSTON,"ended. So quiet was the transition, that those whose eyes were fixed"
4459,BOSTON,"earnestly upon her, could not tell when she drew her last breath. She"
4460,BOSTON,"lay as if in childlike slumber, her cheek reclining upon her hand, and"
4461,BOSTON,on her brow a smile.
4462,BOSTON,
4463,BOSTON,"She died on the 6th of October, 1785, at the age of fourteen years."
4464,BOSTON,"During her short span, she communicated a great amount of happiness to"
4465,BOSTON,those who adopted her as a child into their hearts and homes. The sweet
4466,BOSTON,intercourse and interchange of love more than repaid their cares.
4467,BOSTON,
4468,BOSTON,"They were permitted to aid in her growth of true religion, and to see"
4469,BOSTON,"its calm and glorious triumph over the last great enemy. That a child,"
4470,BOSTON,"under fifteen, should have been enabled thus to rejoice amid the wasting"
4471,BOSTON,"agony of sickness, and thus willingly leave those whom she loved, and"
4472,BOSTON,whose love for her moved them to do all in their power to make life
4473,BOSTON,"pleasant to her young heart, proves the power of a Christian's faith."
4474,BOSTON,
4475,BOSTON,"She desired to be absent from the body, that she might be present with"
4476,BOSTON,"the Lord. Now, before his Throne, whom not having seen, she loved, and"
4477,BOSTON,"raised above the clouds that break in tears, and all shafts of pain and"
4478,BOSTON,"sorrow, she drinks of the rivers of pleasure that flow at his right"
4479,BOSTON,"hand, and shall thirst no more."

4492,BOSTON,Bright garlands there I often make
4493,BOSTON,"Of thyme and daisies fair,"
4494,BOSTON,"And when my throbbing temples ache,"
4495,BOSTON,I go and rest me there.
4496,BOSTON,
4497,BOSTON,"If angry voices harshly chide,"
4498,BOSTON,"Or threatening words are said,"
4499,BOSTON,I love to lay me by their side
4500,BOSTON,Close in that silent bed.
4501,BOSTON,
4502,BOSTON,I wish'd a sportive lamb to bide
4503,BOSTON,My coming o'er the lea.
4504,BOSTON,"It broke away and bleating cried,"

4506,BOSTON,
4507,BOSTON,"""Stay, stay, sweet bird!"" On pinion strong"

4511,BOSTON,
4512,BOSTON,"""Why dost thou fade, young bud of morn,"
4513,BOSTON,"And hide thy drooping gem?"""

4518,BOSTON,"White lambkin, gambol free,"

4527,BOSTON,She cannot burst the chain of fate
4528,BOSTON,By which her limbs are pressed.
4529,BOSTON,"""Dear father rise! and lift the weight"
4530,BOSTON,"That loads my mother's breast."""
4531,BOSTON,
4532,BOSTON,"In vain I speak, in vain the tear"
4533,BOSTON,"Bedews the mouldering clay,"
4534,BOSTON,"My deep complaint they do not hear,"
4535,BOSTON,I may not longer stay.
4536,BOSTON,
4537,BOSTON,"Yet ere I go, I'll kneel and say"
4538,BOSTON,"The humble prayer they taught,"
4539,BOSTON,When by their side at closing day
4540,BOSTON,I breath'd my infant thought.

4551,BOSTON,
4552,BOSTON,
4553,BOSTON,How deep and full of anxiety is the love that centres upon an only
4554,BOSTON,"child, none but parents who have watched over such an one can realise."
4555,BOSTON,"""We trusted our all to _one_ frail bark,"" says a touching epitaph, ""and"
4556,BOSTON,"the wreck was total."""
4557,BOSTON,
4558,BOSTON,"Those who have neither brother nor sister, and feel the whole tenderness"
4559,BOSTON,"of parental affection centring in themselves, should strive to render in"
4560,BOSTON,proportion to what they receive. The care and solicitude that might have
4561,BOSTON,been divided among other claimants is reserved for them alone. No common
4562,BOSTON,"measure of obedience and gratitude, and love, seems to be required of"
4563,BOSTON,"them. Any failure in filial duty is, in them, an aggravated offence. It"
4564,BOSTON,"should be the study of their whole life to appreciate, if they cannot"
4565,BOSTON,"repay, the wealth of love of which they are the sole heirs."
4566,BOSTON,
4567,BOSTON,"Perhaps there has never been an instance, where this sweet indebtedness"
4568,BOSTON,"of the heart was more beautifully and perfectly reciprocated, than in"
4569,BOSTON,the life of Joshua Rowley Gilpin. He was the only son of the Rev. J.
4570,BOSTON,"Gilpin, of Wrockwardine, in the county of Salop, England, and born"
4571,BOSTON,"January 30th, 1788. During infancy, when the texture of character"
4572,BOSTON,"slowly, yet surely discovers itself, he displayed a mild, loving"
4573,BOSTON,"disposition, with no propensity to anger when what he desired was"
4574,BOSTON,"withheld. The sole care of his education was assumed by his parents, who"
4575,BOSTON,found it a source of perpetually increasing delight.
4576,BOSTON,
4577,BOSTON,His first infantine taste was for drawing. To imitate the forms of
4578,BOSTON,"animals, and other objects with which he was daily conversant, gave him"
4579,BOSTON,"much pleasure. His friends discovered in these rude attempts, accuracy"
4580,BOSTON,"of execution, and progressive improvement. A dissected alphabet was"
4581,BOSTON,"among his toys, and a desire to furnish his little drawings with"
4582,BOSTON,appropriate letters induced him to make himself master of it. Now a new
4583,BOSTON,"field of pleasure opened to his mind, and from the amusements of the"
4584,BOSTON,pencil he turned to the powers and combination of the letters; and at
4585,BOSTON,"the age when many children are unacquainted with their names, he was"
4586,BOSTON,forming them into phrases and short sentences. These were sometimes
4587,BOSTON,"playful, and sometimes of such a devotional cast, that his watchful and"
4588,BOSTON,affectionate parents cheered themselves with the hope that his tender
4589,BOSTON,spirit was even then forming an acquaintance with things divine. So
4590,BOSTON,"docile, so industrious, so gentle was the young pupil, that they had"
4591,BOSTON,"never occasion to resort to punishment, or even to address to him an"
4592,BOSTON,expression of displeasure.
4593,BOSTON,
4594,BOSTON,"As the higher branches of knowledge unfolded themselves, he devoted to"
4595,BOSTON,them a studious and willing attention. He was ever cheerfully ready for
4596,BOSTON,"any necessary exercise, and inclined rather to exceed than to fall short"
4597,BOSTON,"of his allotted task. He complained of no difficulty, he solicited no"
4598,BOSTON,"aid: the stated labours of each day he considered a reasonable service,"
4599,BOSTON,and constantly and sweetly submitted his own will to that of his
4600,BOSTON,parents.
4601,BOSTON,
4602,BOSTON,"In the prosecution of the different sciences, his lovely and placid"
4603,BOSTON,disposition was continually displaying itself. The rudiments of the
4604,BOSTON,"Latin tongue, with which he very early became familiar, he wished to"
4605,BOSTON,teach to the young servant woman who attended him from his infancy. By
4606,BOSTON,many fair words he persuaded her to become his scholar. He told her of
4607,BOSTON,"the great pleasure there was in knowledge, and left no method untried to"
4608,BOSTON,gain and fix her attention. If he thought her not sufficiently engaged
4609,BOSTON,"in the pursuit, he would set before her the honourable distinction of"
4610,BOSTON,"surpassing in intellectual attainments, all the other young women of her"
4611,BOSTON,"acquaintance. He made for her use an abridgment of his Latin grammar, to"
4612,BOSTON,"which he added a brief vocabulary, and was never without a few slips of"
4613,BOSTON,"paper in his pocket, on which was some noun regularly declined, or some"
4614,BOSTON,"verb conjugated, for his humble friend and pupil. If the services of the"
4615,BOSTON,"day had failed to afford her sufficient time for his lessons, he"
4616,BOSTON,"redoubled his assiduity when she conducted him to his chamber at night,"
4617,BOSTON,and was never contented without hearing her repeat the Lord's Prayer in
4618,BOSTON,"Greek. This perseverance showed not only the kindness of his heart, but"
4619,BOSTON,his love for those parts of learning which childish students are prone
4620,BOSTON,"to think tedious, or are desirous to curtail and escape."
4621,BOSTON,
4622,BOSTON,"While busily pursuing classic studies, he saw one day a treatise on"
4623,BOSTON,"arithmetic, and immediately went to work on that untried ground. Such"
4624,BOSTON,"satisfaction did he find in it, that he begged to be allowed the same"
4625,BOSTON,exercise whenever he should be at a loss for amusement. For three weeks
4626,BOSTON,"it formed a part of his evening employment, or as he expressed it, his"
4627,BOSTON,"""entertainment,"" and during that brief period, he proceeded to the"
4628,BOSTON,"extraction of the square and cube root, with ease and pleasure. His"
4629,BOSTON,father thought it best to withdraw him at that time from the science of
4630,BOSTON,"numbers, lest it should interfere with his progress in the languages."
4631,BOSTON,"Still, he would occasionally surprise him with abstruse numerical"
4632,BOSTON,"calculation, and, when permitted regularly to pursue mathematics, found"
4633,BOSTON,in the difficult problems of Euclid an intense delight. He would
4634,BOSTON,"willingly have devoted days and nights to them, and no youth was ever"
4635,BOSTON,"more intent on the perusal of a fairy tale or romance, than he to solve"
4636,BOSTON,and demonstrate those propositions in their regular order.
4637,BOSTON,
4638,BOSTON,"Under the tuition of his father, he went through the text-books and"
4639,BOSTON,"authors used in the established seminaries, and probably with a less"
4640,BOSTON,interrupted attention than if he had been a member of their classes. His
4641,BOSTON,"memory was durably retentive, and whatever passage he could not"
4642,BOSTON,"perfectly repeat, he could readily turn to, whether in the writings of"
4643,BOSTON,"the poets, the historians, or the divines. His accuracy was admirable;"
4644,BOSTON,he would never pass over a sentence till he had obtained a satisfactory
4645,BOSTON,"view of its meaning, or lay aside a book without forming a critical"
4646,BOSTON,acquaintance with its style and scope of sentiment. Earnest and untiring
4647,BOSTON,industry was one of the essential elements of his great proficiency;
4648,BOSTON,"employment was to him the life of life, and whatsoever his hand found to"
4649,BOSTON,"do, was done with a whole-souled energy. His love of order was equal to"
4650,BOSTON,"his diligence. From early childhood, he discovered in all his little"
4651,BOSTON,"undertakings an attention to method, and a desire to finish what he"
4652,BOSTON,began. These dispositions gathered strength as he became more fully
4653,BOSTON,acquainted with the importance of time. To each employment or recreation
4654,BOSTON,"he assigned its proper place and season, filling each day with an"
4655,BOSTON,"agreeable and salutary variety, so as to be free on one side from"
4656,BOSTON,"listlessness and apathy, and on the other, from perplexity and haste."
4657,BOSTON,"Highly gratifying was his improvement to his faithful parental teachers,"
4658,BOSTON,and this species of intercourse heightened and gave a peculiar feature
4659,BOSTON,"to their mutual love. Still, their attention was not confined to his"
4660,BOSTON,"intellectual attainments. It was their constant prayer and endeavour,"
4661,BOSTON,"that he might be enabled to blend with these the ""wisdom that cometh"
4662,BOSTON,"from above."" Anxious that he should not be unprepared for the honourable"
4663,BOSTON,"discharge of duty in the present life, they were far more solicitous to"
4664,BOSTON,train him up as a candidate for glory in that which is to come.
4665,BOSTON,
4666,BOSTON,Avoiding the danger of over-pressing or satiating him with theological
4667,BOSTON,"doctrines which transcend the comprehension of childhood, they commenced"
4668,BOSTON,their religious instructions with the greatest simplicity and caution.
4669,BOSTON,They put on no appearance of formality or austerity.
4670,BOSTON,
4671,BOSTON,"""We will show you, my dear son,"" said the father, with a smiling"
4672,BOSTON,"countenance, ""a way that will lead you from earth to heaven."""
4673,BOSTON,
4674,BOSTON,The gentle pupil listened with an earnest attention. His tender mind was
4675,BOSTON,"solemnized, yet filled with joyful and grateful hope. At his first"
4676,BOSTON,"introduction to the house of God, he was filled with reverential awe,"
4677,BOSTON,"and ever afterwards, when attending its sacred services, his deportment"
4678,BOSTON,"evinced the most unaffected decorum, humility, and piety. The greatest"
4679,BOSTON,"care was taken that the observance of the Sabbath at home, as well as in"
4680,BOSTON,"church, should be accounted a sweet and holy privilege."
4681,BOSTON,
4682,BOSTON,"""On that day,"" says his father, ""we gave a more unlimited indulgence to"
4683,BOSTON,our affectionate and devotional feelings. We conversed together as parts
4684,BOSTON,"of the same Christian family, we rejoiced over each other as heirs of"
4685,BOSTON,"the same glorious promises. Some interesting passage of Scripture, or"
4686,BOSTON,"some choice piece of divinity, generally furnished the matter of our"
4687,BOSTON,"discourse, and while we endeavoured to obtain a clear, comprehensive"
4688,BOSTON,"view of the subject before us, it seemed as if a blessed light"
4689,BOSTON,"sometimes broke in upon us, removing our doubts, exalting our"
4690,BOSTON,"conceptions, and cheering our hearts. Then, with one consent, we have"
4691,BOSTON,"laid aside the book, that we might uninterruptedly admire the beauties"
4692,BOSTON,of the opening prospect. Thus solacing ourselves with a view of our
4693,BOSTON,"future enjoyments, and the place of our final destination, we have"
4694,BOSTON,"solemnly renewed our vows, resolving for the joy that was set before us,"
4695,BOSTON,"to endure the Cross, despising the shame, in humble imitation of our"
4696,BOSTON,adorable Master. In such a frame of mind we found it possible to speak
4697,BOSTON,"of probable sufferings, or painful separations, with the utmost"
4698,BOSTON,"composure. With such a termination of our course in sight, we could"
4699,BOSTON,cheerfully leave all the casualties of that course to the Divine
4700,BOSTON,"disposal; fully persuaded that whatever evil might befall us on the way,"
4701,BOSTON,"an abundant compensation for all awaited us on our arrival at home."""
4702,BOSTON,
4703,BOSTON,"As he advanced in boyhood, his love of study and sedentary habits became"
4704,BOSTON,so strong that it was feared he might not take sufficient exercise for
4705,BOSTON,"the preservation of health. The friends of the family, therefore,"
4706,BOSTON,"urgently advised that he might be placed in a public school, hoping that"
4707,BOSTON,the influence of companions of his own age would allure him to athletic
4708,BOSTON,sports.
4709,BOSTON,
4710,BOSTON,"In this counsel his parents acquiesced, but finding the idea of"
4711,BOSTON,"separation insupportably painful, they removed, and took a temporary"
4712,BOSTON,"residence near the Seminary of which he became a member. Here, every"
4713,BOSTON,"thing was novel, and his enthusiastic mental picture of what a school"
4714,BOSTON,"must be, was considerably darkened by discovering so much indolence and"
4715,BOSTON,"irregularity, where he supposed all would be order, intelligence, and"
4716,BOSTON,"progress. His academic exercises were performed with entire ease, so"
4717,BOSTON,thorough and extensive had been his home culture; and though there were
4718,BOSTON,"many in the different classes who were his seniors in age, he rapidly"
4719,BOSTON,rose to the first and highest place. Of this post he had not been
4720,BOSTON,"ambitious, and he occupied it with such modesty and affability, so as to"
4721,BOSTON,"conciliate his school-fellows, between whom and himself there was still"
4722,BOSTON,"such diversity of habit and feeling, as to repress all familiarity of"
4723,BOSTON,"intercourse. But with his instructors, a true and reciprocal friendship"
4724,BOSTON,was established. Especially did the head master distinguish the talents
4725,BOSTON,"of the young student with the strongest marks of esteem, designating him"
4726,BOSTON,"as the ""pride of his school, and the pride of his heart."""
4727,BOSTON,
4728,BOSTON,"The return of this excellent family to their beloved village, formed a"
4729,BOSTON,delightful scene. An affectionate flock thronged to welcome their
4730,BOSTON,"Pastor, while the youth on whose account they had for a time left their"
4731,BOSTON,"endeared habitation, gazed with unutterable joy on the trees, the"
4732,BOSTON,"cottages, the cliffs that varied the spot of his nativity, on every room"
4733,BOSTON,"in the parsonage, every plant in the garden, every vine that clasped the"
4734,BOSTON,"walls, and on the far blue hills, behind which he had watched from"
4735,BOSTON,infancy the glories of the setting sun. To the congratulations of his
4736,BOSTON,"friends, some of which alluded to the brilliancy of his prospects as a"
4737,BOSTON,"distinguished scholar, he replied with ineffable sweetness,"
4738,BOSTON,
4739,BOSTON,"""No possible change in my situation can make any addition to my present"
4740,BOSTON,"happiness."""
4741,BOSTON,
4742,BOSTON,The love of home was one of the strongest features in his character. The
4743,BOSTON,vanities and gayeties of London had no power to diminish or modify it.
4744,BOSTON,"After passing two months there, at the age of sixteen, he came to his"
4745,BOSTON,"retired abode with the same delight, the same unassuming manners and"
4746,BOSTON,simplicity of taste. On entering the secluded vale where their humble
4747,BOSTON,"rural habitation was situated, he expressed his feelings in a few"
4748,BOSTON,"extempore Latin verses, which at the request of his mother, were thus"
4749,BOSTON,"translated,"
4750,BOSTON,
4751,BOSTON,"""Lives there a youth, who far from home,"
4752,BOSTON,Through novel scenes exults to roam?
4753,BOSTON,"Then let the restless vagrant go,"
4754,BOSTON,And idly pass from show to show;
4755,BOSTON,"While in my native village bless'd,"
4756,BOSTON,"Delighted still, and still at rest,"
4757,BOSTON,"Without disturbance or alloy,"
4758,BOSTON,"Life's purest pleasures I enjoy."""
4759,BOSTON,
4760,BOSTON,"While thus bearing in his bosom the elements of happiness, true piety,"
4761,BOSTON,"active goodness, and love to all creatures, and while diligently"
4762,BOSTON,"preparing for the sacred profession to which he was destined, a sudden"
4763,BOSTON,"attack of pulmonary disease, attended with hemorrhage, alarmed those to"
4764,BOSTON,whom he was dear. But the consequent debility readily yielded to medical
4765,BOSTON,"treatment, and a journey and residence of several weeks amid the pure"
4766,BOSTON,"atmosphere and rural scenery of Wales, combining with uncommon salubrity"
4767,BOSTON,"of weather, seemed to restore the gentle invalid to his usual state of"
4768,BOSTON,health.
4769,BOSTON,
4770,BOSTON,"He was able again to resume his course of academic studies, and after"
4771,BOSTON,"the midsummer vacation, which he spent in a pleasant journey with his"
4772,BOSTON,"beloved parents, was summoned to sustain an examination as a candidate"
4773,BOSTON,for two vacant exhibitions. When he took his seat before the collegiate
4774,BOSTON,"tutors, clergy, magistrates, and a concourse of assembled visitors, a"
4775,BOSTON,"degree of that diffidence was observable, which is so often the"
4776,BOSTON,"concomitant of genius. But in every exercise and test of knowledge, he"
4777,BOSTON,"was so self-possessed, so prompt, so perfect, that there was an"
4778,BOSTON,unanimous burst of approbation and applause. His parents were loaded
4779,BOSTON,"with congratulations for possessing the treasure of such a son, and a"
4780,BOSTON,"paper signed by all present was addressed to the manager of the Funds,"
4781,BOSTON,requesting that the sum allotted to a successful candidate might be
4782,BOSTON,doubled on account of his extraordinary attainments. With entire
4783,BOSTON,"meekness he bore this full tide of honour, manifesting no satisfaction"
4784,BOSTON,"in hearing his own praises, and after his return home, never made the"
4785,BOSTON,most distant allusion to this flattering event in the life of a young
4786,BOSTON,"student. He was now entered a fellow-commoner at Christ Church College,"
4787,BOSTON,"Oxford, with the intention of not taking his residence there till the"
4788,BOSTON,commencement of the ensuing term.
4789,BOSTON,
4790,BOSTON,"He most assiduously devoted himself to his studies, rising early and"
4791,BOSTON,finding the day too short for his active mind. Knowledge was dear to him
4792,BOSTON,"for its own sake, and not for the flattering distinctions accorded to it"
4793,BOSTON,"among men: for while advancing in scholastic acquirements, he was"
4794,BOSTON,evidently an humble peaceful student in the school of Christ. His
4795,BOSTON,"parents were comforted amid the painful prospect of separation, with the"
4796,BOSTON,"hope that from his early and growing piety, his temperance and modesty,"
4797,BOSTON,"his untiring diligence, and a certain firmness of mind, of which he had"
4798,BOSTON,"given indisputable evidence, he would in time of temptation choose the"
4799,BOSTON,"good, and refuse the evil."
4800,BOSTON,
4801,BOSTON,"In the meantime, his birth-day arrived, the last that he was to spend on"
4802,BOSTON,"earth. It had ever been their household custom to mark it, not by"
4803,BOSTON,"sumptuous entertainments or the invitation of guests, but by expressions"
4804,BOSTON,"of affection among themselves, and the most fervent ascriptions of"
4805,BOSTON,"praise to God, for the gift he had accorded and preserved. But it seems"
4806,BOSTON,that their sacred anniversary had been discovered and was cherished by
4807,BOSTON,"others. While interchanging their sweet and secluded memorials of love,"
4808,BOSTON,"a letter arrived addressed to the young student, containing a large"
4809,BOSTON,"number of banknotes, ""as a joint token of the affection of a few"
4810,BOSTON,"friends, who desired permission to repeat the same expression of their"
4811,BOSTON,"regard on each return of his natal day, until he should have taken his"
4812,BOSTON,"first degree at the University."""
4813,BOSTON,
4814,BOSTON,"This unexpected mark of the high esteem in which he was held, was"
4815,BOSTON,received by him with strong indications of astonishment and gratitude.
4816,BOSTON,"As the time drew near for his departure to Oxford, his parents could"
4817,BOSTON,"scarcely be restrained from uttering the impassioned words, ""Entreat me"
4818,BOSTON,"not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee, for where"
4819,BOSTON,"thou goest I will go, where thou lodgest I will lodge;"" not knowing that"
4820,BOSTON,"it was the appointment of God, that only the cold hand of death should"
4821,BOSTON,divide them.
4822,BOSTON,
4823,BOSTON,"Spring approached, and the wound in his lungs, which it had been hoped"
4824,BOSTON,"was permanently healed, burst forth afresh. Aggravated by the influenza,"
4825,BOSTON,"then an epidemic, it soon took the form of an incurable malady. With"
4826,BOSTON,entire submission he met this sudden change in his state and prospects.
4827,BOSTON,"No murmuring word was uttered, no trace of anxiety visible on his"
4828,BOSTON,countenance. Neither loss of appetite nor decay of strength could impair
4829,BOSTON,his settled composure of mind. So admirable was the mixture of meekness
4830,BOSTON,"and manliness in his deportment, that it was difficult to say whether"
4831,BOSTON,patience or fortitude most predominated.
4832,BOSTON,
4833,BOSTON,"Constantly advancing in the knowledge of divine things, he withdrew"
4834,BOSTON,himself from every pursuit that might divert his thoughts from the great
4835,BOSTON,"end of his being, the entrance to a higher state of existence. The poets"
4836,BOSTON,"and orators of Greece and Rome, in which his proficiency had been so"
4837,BOSTON,"great, were meekly exchanged for works of experimental religion; and he"
4838,BOSTON,"sat daily at the feet of some master in Israel, from whose teachings he"
4839,BOSTON,"hoped to gain heavenly wisdom. By the advice of physicians, the scene"
4840,BOSTON,was changed for a short time; but wherever they journeyed he was still
4841,BOSTON,making his solitary passage through the valley of the shadow of death.
4842,BOSTON,"As the last hope of success, the waters of Bristol were proposed; and"
4843,BOSTON,"though he at first mildly resisted it, from an inward conviction that"
4844,BOSTON,"the trouble would be in vain, yet unwilling to crush the expectations of"
4845,BOSTON,"his beloved parents, he yielded to their wishes. On all similar"
4846,BOSTON,occasions he had required quite a package of books; now he requested
4847,BOSTON,only an English Bible and a Greek Testament.
4848,BOSTON,
4849,BOSTON,"Notwithstanding every precaution of medical skill and care, consumption"
4850,BOSTON,"was accomplishing its fatal work. The parents and their only child,"
4851,BOSTON,"though convinced of what the result must be, still shrank back from"
4852,BOSTON,"harrowing up each other's feelings, by full conversation on the subject"
4853,BOSTON,that most occupied their thoughts.
4854,BOSTON,
4855,BOSTON,"""As it was with Elijah and his attached successor,"" writes the sorrowing"
4856,BOSTON,"father, ""at their approaching separation, so it was with us. They"
4857,BOSTON,"maintained towards each other a delicate reserve, as they proceeded from"
4858,BOSTON,"Bethel to Jericho, and from Jericho to Jordan; the one not daring to"
4859,BOSTON,"glory in his expected ascension, nor the other to express his mournful"
4860,BOSTON,"forebodings, lest they might mutually agitate the other, or disturb the"
4861,BOSTON,order of the holy solemnity. But as the awful moment drew near and he
4862,BOSTON,"was about to be gone, Elijah rose above the weakness of humanity, and"
4863,BOSTON,"openly asserted the purpose of Heaven. Thus the dear invalid, when made"
4864,BOSTON,"certain by some invisible token that his hour was at hand, thought it"
4865,BOSTON,unsuitable to our common character to leave this world without giving
4866,BOSTON,"glory to God."""
4867,BOSTON,
4868,BOSTON,"With entire tranquillity and the utmost tenderness, he introduced the"
4869,BOSTON,"subject of his departure, spoke of his trust in his Redeemer, his"
4870,BOSTON,gratitude for the goodness and mercy that had followed him throughout
4871,BOSTON,"the whole of his earthly pilgrimage, and the joy he felt in having his"
4872,BOSTON,"own will perfectly bowed to the will of God. Even then, the last"
4873,BOSTON,messenger was waiting for him. He accepted the anxious attentions of his
4874,BOSTON,"agonized parents with ineffable sweetness, regarding them with a"
4875,BOSTON,"thoughtful benignity, not wholly restraining his feelings, nor yet"
4876,BOSTON,allowing them a free indulgence.
4877,BOSTON,
4878,BOSTON,"It was in the autumn of 1806, at the age of eighteen, that his last day"
4879,BOSTON,"on earth closed. He lay as in calm and beautiful repose, seeming to have"
4880,BOSTON,"opened a communication with the celestial world, and fully resigned"
4881,BOSTON,himself to intercourse with its unseen inhabitants. Kneeling around his
4882,BOSTON,"couch in trembling expectation, were those whose sole earthly hopes had"
4883,BOSTON,"been bound up in him. There was a short and solemn pause, a few soft"
4884,BOSTON,"moans, and then, without the slightest change of posture, he peacefully"
4885,BOSTON,breathed out his soul into the bosom of his Father and his God.
4886,BOSTON,
4887,BOSTON,
4888,BOSTON,
4889,BOSTON,
4890,BOSTON,Life.
4891,BOSTON,
4892,BOSTON,
4893,BOSTON,Life is beautiful! its duties
4894,BOSTON,"Cluster round each passing day,"
4895,BOSTON,While their sweet and solemn voices spot
4896,BOSTON,"Warn to work, to watch, to pray;"
4897,BOSTON,They alone its blessings forfeit
4898,BOSTON,"Who by sin their spirits cheat,"
4899,BOSTON,"Or to slothful stupor yielding,"
4900,BOSTON,Let the rust their armour eat.

4903,BOSTON,"Round its roots with ardour cling,"
4904,BOSTON,"'Mid its opening blossoms nestle,"
4905,BOSTON,"Bird-like, in its branches sing,"
4906,BOSTON,"Smiling lull its cradle slumbers,"
4907,BOSTON,"Guard with pride its youthful bloom,"
4908,BOSTON,"Fondly kiss its snow-white temples,"
4909,BOSTON,Dew the turf-mound o'er its tomb.
4910,BOSTON,
4911,BOSTON,Life is beautiful with promise
4912,BOSTON,"Of a joy that cannot fade,"
4913,BOSTON,"Life is fearful, with the threatening"
4914,BOSTON,Of an everlasting shade.
4915,BOSTON,"May no thoughtless wanderer scorn it,"
4916,BOSTON,"Blindly lost in folly's maze,"
4917,BOSTON,"Duty, love, and hope adorn it:"
4918,BOSTON,Let its latest breath be praise.
4919,BOSTON,
4920,BOSTON,
4921,BOSTON,
4922,BOSTON,
4923,BOSTON,A Remarkable Child.
4924,BOSTON,
4925,BOSTON,
4926,BOSTON,The child of whose virtues and attainments the following pages give but
4927,BOSTON,"an imperfect sketch, was the son of the late Dr. J. Smyth Rogers, and"
4928,BOSTON,"born in the city of New York, on the 28th of January, 1825. The beauty"
4929,BOSTON,"of his infancy struck every observer, and this continued to increase as"
4930,BOSTON,added intelligence lighted up his noble features. As his brilliant mind
4931,BOSTON,"expanded, amiable and generous dispositions were revealed, clothed with"
4932,BOSTON,peculiarly winning manners. It would seem also that these graces and
4933,BOSTON,"virtues, like wreaths of bright buds, and clusters of rich fruit, sprang"
4934,BOSTON,from the best of all roots: a truthful and pious heart.
4935,BOSTON,
4936,BOSTON,"At the early age of three years, his excellent mother was suddenly taken"
4937,BOSTON,away. That mournful event made a deep impression upon his unfolding
4938,BOSTON,character. For three years she had been permitted to watch over this
4939,BOSTON,fair opening flower; in three more it was to be laid on her bosom in
4940,BOSTON,heaven.
4941,BOSTON,
4942,BOSTON,"The night after the death of this beloved parent, his deportment was"
4943,BOSTON,remarked as evincing a degree of reflection and sensibility to the
4944,BOSTON,"magnitude of his loss, surpassing what is usually seen in infancy. It"
4945,BOSTON,"was Sabbath evening, the period in which she had been accustomed to"
4946,BOSTON,"gather her little ones around her, and impart religious instruction."
4947,BOSTON,"Now, at the fireside, the happy circle was broken: the blessed mother's"
4948,BOSTON,"seat vacant. He yearned for her sweet smile, the sound of her tuneful"
4949,BOSTON,"voice. Turning from the other children, he walked long by himself with a"
4950,BOSTON,slow and noiseless step; often fixing his eyes on his bereaved father
4951,BOSTON,with an expression of the deepest commiseration. No attitude of grief
4952,BOSTON,"escaped his mournful notice, and it seemed as if he restrained his own"
4953,BOSTON,sorrow that he might offer consolation to his afflicted parent. That
4954,BOSTON,mingling of perfect sympathy with the exceeding beauty of his infant
4955,BOSTON,"countenance, neither pen nor pencil could adequately describe."
4956,BOSTON,
4957,BOSTON,But the early maturity of his heart was fully equalled by the
4958,BOSTON,"development of his intellect. Before acquiring the elements of reading,"
4959,BOSTON,he listened so attentively to the recitations of an elder brother and
4960,BOSTON,"sister, as to become master of much correct information. His desire for"
4961,BOSTON,knowledge was insatiable. He was sensible of no fatigue while employed
4962,BOSTON,"in attaining it. Though fond of amusements, he was always happy to quit"
4963,BOSTON,them when the allotted hours for study arrived. The rudiments of science
4964,BOSTON,he acquired with astonishing rapidity. Before the completion of his
4965,BOSTON,"fourth year he could read any English book with ease, and also with a"
4966,BOSTON,"propriety and understanding of the varieties of style, not often"
4967,BOSTON,discovered by students at twice his age. At this period he was expert in
4968,BOSTON,the simple rules of arithmetical calculation. With the geography of his
4969,BOSTON,"own country, and with the outlines of that of the world, he was"
4970,BOSTON,intimately acquainted. At five years old he was well versed both in
4971,BOSTON,"ancient and modern geography. In mental arithmetic, many problems"
4972,BOSTON,"requiring thought even in mature and long disciplined minds, he solved"
4973,BOSTON,"readily, and as if with intuitive perception. Of the history of his own"
4974,BOSTON,"country, his knowledge was well digested and chronologically arranged."
4975,BOSTON,"At the age of six years, he could with the greatest fluency give a"
4976,BOSTON,"judicious abstract of it, placing in due order the events connected with"
4977,BOSTON,"its discovery and settlement, the period of its several wars, their"
4978,BOSTON,"causes, results, and the circumstances by which they were modified. From"
4979,BOSTON,"the characters who were conspicuous in its annals, he evinced"
4980,BOSTON,discrimination in selecting those most worthy of admiration. The
4981,BOSTON,"biography of the celebrated John Smith he related with animation, often"
4982,BOSTON,mentioning their similarity of name. In repeating his feats of heroism
4983,BOSTON,"and endurance, he seemed to identify himself with the actor and to"
4984,BOSTON,partake of his spirit. But he regarded with still higher enthusiasm the
4985,BOSTON,"illustrious Pitt. When rehearsing his speech in favour of America, he"
4986,BOSTON,would involuntarily add the most bold and graceful gestures. These lofty
4987,BOSTON,"and noble sentiments seemed to awaken a warm response in his bosom, and"
4988,BOSTON,"to rule, as if with congenial force, the associations of thought and"
4989,BOSTON,feeling.
4990,BOSTON,
4991,BOSTON,In the science of geometry he displayed a vigorous and highly
4992,BOSTON,"disciplined mind, by the ready demonstration of some of its most"
4993,BOSTON,difficult propositions. But in no attainment was the superiority of his
4994,BOSTON,intellect more clearly defined than in his acquisition of the Hebrew
4995,BOSTON,"language. He commenced this pursuit when four years of age, at the"
4996,BOSTON,"suggestion of a cousin older than himself, to whose recitations he had"
4997,BOSTON,attentively listened. Having been restrained by modesty for several days
4998,BOSTON,"from mentioning his wishes, he at length ventured to ask his preceptor"
4999,BOSTON,if he might be permitted to study Hebrew. Happy to gratify such a
5000,BOSTON,"desire, he called him to his side, intending to teach him two or three"
5001,BOSTON,"letters, when he discovered, to his surprise, that he already knew the"
5002,BOSTON,whole alphabet. From that time he continued to study the language with
5003,BOSTON,"perseverance, and constantly increasing fondness. Soon, without aid,"
5004,BOSTON,"except from the grammar and lexicon, he could read, translate, and parse"
5005,BOSTON,"the Hebrew, with an elegance that might have done honour to an adept in"
5006,BOSTON,that sacred language. Before his death he had read more than fifty
5007,BOSTON,chapters; and so great was his ardour and delight in prosecuting this
5008,BOSTON,"study, that after having received two exercises daily, throughout the"
5009,BOSTON,"week, he would often be found on Sabbath with his Hebrew Bible,"
5010,BOSTON,"earnestly engaged in reviewing passages by himself. On one occasion,"
5011,BOSTON,"when his tutor was to be absent for a few days, he inquired, ""How will"
5012,BOSTON,"you spend your time?"" The prompt reply was, ""In studying Hebrew."" In"
5013,BOSTON,"Greek, also, he made such proficiency as to read the original of the New"
5014,BOSTON,"Testament with accuracy and ease. On every attainment, however difficult"
5015,BOSTON,"or abstruse, his genius seized, and almost without effort rendered it"
5016,BOSTON,his own; so that this infant student seemed to adopt the sentiment of
5017,BOSTON,"the great Bacon, and to ""take all knowledge to be his province."""
5018,BOSTON,
5019,BOSTON,"Yet with these astonishing acquisitions there mingled no vanity, no"
5020,BOSTON,"consciousness of superior talent, nor distaste for the simplest"
5021,BOSTON,pleasures of childhood. He had all the docility and playfulness that
5022,BOSTON,belong to the first years of life. In the delightful country residence
5023,BOSTON,"where the family were accustomed to pass the summer months, those who"
5024,BOSTON,"saw him only at the period allotted to sport and exercise, would have"
5025,BOSTON,"remarked him as an exceedingly beautiful, vigorous, light-hearted boy,"
5026,BOSTON,without imagining him possessed of accomplishments that might have put
5027,BOSTON,manhood to the blush. Amid a flow of animal spirits that were sometimes
5028,BOSTON,"deemed excessive, he was never regardless of the feelings of others."
5029,BOSTON,"During the active sports of childhood, if he received unintentional"
5030,BOSTON,"injury from his companions, he was anxious to assure them, by an"
5031,BOSTON,"affectionate kiss, of his recovery and reconciliation. He possessed the"
5032,BOSTON,most lively and amiable sensibility. This was fully depicted upon his
5033,BOSTON,"countenance, so that the most careless observer could scarcely have"
5034,BOSTON,mistaken its lineaments. He ardently participated in the joys and
5035,BOSTON,sorrows of those around him. His love for his friends was testified by
5036,BOSTON,the most tender care for their accommodation and comfort. He was found
5037,BOSTON,"one evening in a flood of tears, because he feared his teacher had gone"
5038,BOSTON,out in the rain without great-coat or umbrella. So great was his
5039,BOSTON,"generosity, that whatever was given him he desired to share with"
5040,BOSTON,another. He seemed incapable of selfish gratification. When from
5041,BOSTON,"delicacy of health his appetite had been long subjected to restraint, if"
5042,BOSTON,"a small portion of cake or fruit was allowed him, he was never satisfied"
5043,BOSTON,until he had imparted it. He would even urge the domestics to
5044,BOSTON,"participate in his gifts. On one occasion, after a period of abstinence"
5045,BOSTON,"from fruit, four grapes were given him. Two of these he ate, and saved"
5046,BOSTON,the remaining two to give to his nurse. The merit of this self-denial
5047,BOSTON,"was enhanced by the circumstance often remarked by the servants, that"
5048,BOSTON,"the nurse was far less fond of him than of his elder brother, who, from"
5049,BOSTON,"being more immediately under her care, was the object of her partiality."
5050,BOSTON,But there was nothing of vindictiveness in his nature. His generosity
5051,BOSTON,was as disinterested as it was unbounded.
5052,BOSTON,
5053,BOSTON,"One morning his father testified approbation of his conduct by saying,"
5054,BOSTON,"""You may go into the garden and gather twelve strawberries."" ""And may I"
5055,BOSTON,"divide them equally?"" he inquired with great animation. Amid a profusion"
5056,BOSTON,"of the finest fruits, for which he had an extreme fondness, and which"
5057,BOSTON,"he was accustomed to see hospitably dispensed to numerous guests, he"
5058,BOSTON,"would never transgress a prohibition to partake, or a limitation with"
5059,BOSTON,"regard to quantity. Obedience had been taught him from the beginning,"
5060,BOSTON,"and his fidelity in keeping the law of those who directed him, whether"
5061,BOSTON,"they were present or absent, was one of his prominent virtues. In the"
5062,BOSTON,"indispositions to which he was occasionally subject, he would cheerfully"
5063,BOSTON,"take the most unpleasant medicines, and submit to the most irksome"
5064,BOSTON,"regulations, if simply told that his father had desired it."
5065,BOSTON,
5066,BOSTON,Openness and integrity of character were conspicuous in him. He seemed
5067,BOSTON,"to have nothing to conceal. He had no disposition to practise mischief,"
5068,BOSTON,or to devise means that any thing which he had done should be kept
5069,BOSTON,secret from those who had the charge of his education. As his course of
5070,BOSTON,"instruction was pursued entirely at home, he was preserved from the"
5071,BOSTON,"contagion of bad example, and from many temptations to deceit. The"
5072,BOSTON,little faults which he committed he confessed with the utmost
5073,BOSTON,"ingenuousness, and complied with the precept which had been early"
5074,BOSTON,"impressed upon him by parental care, to solicit the forgiveness of his"
5075,BOSTON,"Father in heaven, if he hoped to obtain that of his best friends on"
5076,BOSTON,"earth. When he received any punishment, he made immediate returns of"
5077,BOSTON,penitence and affection. He considered it as the appointed way in which
5078,BOSTON,"he was to be made better, and so far from indulging in complaint or"
5079,BOSTON,"sullenness, was inclined to think it lighter than he deserved."
5080,BOSTON,
5081,BOSTON,"A tender and true piety pervaded his heart, and breathed its fragrance"
5082,BOSTON,over a life as beautiful and transient as the flower of the grass.
5083,BOSTON,"Accustomed from infancy never to neglect his prayers, morning or"
5084,BOSTON,"evening, and to keep the day of God sacred, he delighted in these"
5085,BOSTON,"exercises. To lay aside all implements of light amusement, and to read"
5086,BOSTON,"or hear only books adapted to that consecrated day, had been required of"
5087,BOSTON,him from his earliest recollection. He was grieved if he saw any violate
5088,BOSTON,these injunctions. There seemed to have been laid in his heart a firm
5089,BOSTON,"basis of Christian principle, on which he was beginning to rear a noble"
5090,BOSTON,superstructure. He never discovered more ardent delight than while
5091,BOSTON,"listening to the inspired pages, or greater brilliancy of intellect than"
5092,BOSTON,when conversing on their doctrines and practical illustrations. The life
5093,BOSTON,"and sufferings of the Redeemer, and the hopes held out to sinners"
5094,BOSTON,"through his mercy, were his treasured and favourite subjects. He often"
5095,BOSTON,"with great earnestness solicited instruction respecting them, and his"
5096,BOSTON,absorbed and delighted attention would survive the endurance of his
5097,BOSTON,physical strength. Of religious books he was particularly fond. He
5098,BOSTON,conceived the strongest attachment for 'Doddridge's Family Expositor.'
5099,BOSTON,He would voluntarily resort to its perusal with the greatest apparent
5100,BOSTON,satisfaction. Observing that his cousin and sister received weekly
5101,BOSTON,"lessons from that excellent volume, in the explanation of difficult"
5102,BOSTON,"passages, he said to his instructor with a mournful air, ""You give the"
5103,BOSTON,"elder children a lesson in Doddridge, but you don't let me recite with"
5104,BOSTON,"them."" He was told that it was probably too difficult an exercise for"
5105,BOSTON,"him, and that therefore he had not been permitted to join them. On being"
5106,BOSTON,"asked what he understood as the meaning of the expression, where John is"
5107,BOSTON,"said to come in the ""spirit and power of Elias,"" and to ""turn the hearts"
5108,BOSTON,"of the fathers to the children,"" he gave without mistake the two"
5109,BOSTON,"interpretations to which he had listened some time before. Thus, while"
5110,BOSTON,this infant disciple was pursuing religious knowledge as a delightful
5111,BOSTON,"and congenial study, he was also cherishing a lively sense of the"
5112,BOSTON,obligations that it imposed. He received the truth in its love and in
5113,BOSTON,its power. It began to be within him a prompting and regulating
5114,BOSTON,principle. Whenever the full flow of childish spirits became excessive
5115,BOSTON,"or ill-timed, they were restrained by suggesting a precept drawn from"
5116,BOSTON,the Scriptures.
5117,BOSTON,
5118,BOSTON,"Among his modes of recreation, riding on horseback in the freshness of"
5119,BOSTON,"the morning was highly enjoyed and prized. One morning, when the usual"
5120,BOSTON,"period for this exercise had been somewhat delayed, his tutor asked,"
5121,BOSTON,"""Would you like to take your ride?"" and he replied, ""I am afraid we"
5122,BOSTON,"shall not be back in time for prayers. So I would rather not go."""
5123,BOSTON,
5124,BOSTON,Of his departed mother his recollections were tender and vivid. He
5125,BOSTON,delighted to speak of her as the habitant of a world of joy. His
5126,BOSTON,affectionate spirit seemed content to resign her that she might be with
5127,BOSTON,"Christ. To a beloved relative, whose efforts for his religious"
5128,BOSTON,"instruction were unceasing, he said, soon after the death of his mother,"
5129,BOSTON,"""Aunt, do you not wish that the judgment day was come?"" ""Why, my son?"""
5130,BOSTON,"she enquired. ""Because then I should see my _dear mamma_ and my blessed"
5131,BOSTON,"Saviour."""
5132,BOSTON,
5133,BOSTON,The religious exercises of Sabbath evening were to him a season of high
5134,BOSTON,"enjoyment. After the catechism and other appropriate duties, some book"
5135,BOSTON,"of piety was read, and the children indulged in such discourse as its"
5136,BOSTON,"contents naturally elicited. Piety, disrobed of gloom, was presented to"
5137,BOSTON,"them as an object of love, and by his heart was most fondly welcomed."
5138,BOSTON,
5139,BOSTON,"On Sabbath evening preceding the Christmas of 1831, he was observed to"
5140,BOSTON,enter with extreme ardour into the conversation that flowed from the
5141,BOSTON,"perusal of 'Parlour Lectures,' an analysis of Sacred History adapted to"
5142,BOSTON,"juvenile minds. His father, whose labours in the pious nurture of his"
5143,BOSTON,"children had been as untiring as successful, being absent from the city,"
5144,BOSTON,"he drew his chair as near as possible to his aunt, listened eagerly to"
5145,BOSTON,"every remark, poured forth the rapturous pleasure that filled his"
5146,BOSTON,"breast, and desired to protract the enjoyment beyond its usual period."
5147,BOSTON,It was to be his last Sabbath on earth. In the course of the ensuing
5148,BOSTON,"week he became a victim to the scarlet fever, and on Friday, December"
5149,BOSTON,"24th, 1831, went to his Father in heaven."
5150,BOSTON,
5151,BOSTON,"Thus passed away, at the age of nearly seven years, a being formed to"
5152,BOSTON,"excel in all that was beautiful, intellectual, and heavenly. Precocity"
5153,BOSTON,in him was divested of the evils that are wont to attend it. All his
5154,BOSTON,associations of thought were healthful and happy. There was no undue
5155,BOSTON,predominance of one power at the expense of the rest. No one department
5156,BOSTON,of character eclipsed the other. The mind and the heart pressed on
5157,BOSTON,"together with equal steps, in a vigorous and holy brotherhood. The soul,"
5158,BOSTON,"like a lily, fed with dews of Hermon, breathed its first freshest"
5159,BOSTON,incense in piety to God.
5160,BOSTON,
5161,BOSTON,That he was highly gifted by nature none can doubt. That he owed much to
5162,BOSTON,education is equally certain. It would be difficult to define the
5163,BOSTON,precise point where the influence of the one ceased and that of the
5164,BOSTON,other began; so finely did their hues and pencillings blend in the
5165,BOSTON,flower thus early offered to its Maker.
5166,BOSTON,
5167,BOSTON,"Strict obedience to his superiors, and the duty of stated prayer, were"
5168,BOSTON,so early impressed as to be incorporated with the elements of his
5169,BOSTON,"character. Simple habits, rural tastes, control of the animal appetites,"
5170,BOSTON,"and correct deportment to all around him, were carefully inculcated,"
5171,BOSTON,while a thorough course of classical instruction under his father's
5172,BOSTON,roof protected him from the dangers of promiscuous association and
5173,BOSTON,sinful example. The most favourable results might reasonably be
5174,BOSTON,anticipated from a system of culture so vigilant that temptation could
5175,BOSTON,"not assail from without, nor spring up within, without being detected;"
5176,BOSTON,so judicious that wealth had no power to enervate either the body or the
5177,BOSTON,mind; so affectionate that the tendrils of the heart were free to expand
5178,BOSTON,"in innocent happiness; so faithful in its ministrations to the soul,"
5179,BOSTON,that the Divine blessing seemed visibly to descend upon it. This wise
5180,BOSTON,"discipline combining with the Creator's exceeding bounty, rendered him"
5181,BOSTON,"what he was: a being to be loved by all who looked upon him, and to be"
5182,BOSTON,held in lasting remembrance by all who knew him.
5183,BOSTON,
5184,BOSTON,To borrow the expressive language of one who had long superintended his
5185,BOSTON,"education, and was intimately acquainted with his mental and moral"
5186,BOSTON,"structure, ""So insensible was he to all those passions which prompt to"
5187,BOSTON,"self-defence and self-protection, and so entirely under the influence of"
5188,BOSTON,that forgiving spirit which being smitten on the one cheek would turn
5189,BOSTON,"the other also, and that overflowing generosity, which, after the cloak"
5190,BOSTON,"is taken, would give the coat likewise, as utterly to unfit him for the"
5191,BOSTON,"society of selfish, avaricious, overbearing men, whence I have fondly"
5192,BOSTON,"thought, that he was thus early invited to a mansion where he might"
5193,BOSTON,"enjoy the communion of more congenial spirits."""
5194,BOSTON,
5195,BOSTON,
5196,BOSTON,
5197,BOSTON,
5198,BOSTON,The Dying Sunday School Boy.
5199,BOSTON,
5200,BOSTON,
5201,BOSTON,"His hands were clasp'd, his eyelids clos'd,"
5202,BOSTON,"As on his couch he lay,"
5203,BOSTON,While slumber seem'd to wrap the form
5204,BOSTON,That pain had worn away:
5205,BOSTON,
5206,BOSTON,But still the watching mother marked
5207,BOSTON,"His pallid lips to part,"
5208,BOSTON,As if some all-absorbing thought
5209,BOSTON,Lay on his dreaming heart;
5210,BOSTON,
5211,BOSTON,For yet he slept not. Silent prayer
5212,BOSTON,"Commun'd with God alone,"
5213,BOSTON,"And then his glazing eyes he rais'd,"
5214,BOSTON,And spoke with tender tone:
5215,BOSTON,
5216,BOSTON,"""Oh mother! often in my class,"
5217,BOSTON,"I've heard the teacher say,"
5218,BOSTON,That those who to the Saviour turn
5219,BOSTON,He would not cast away;
5220,BOSTON,
5221,BOSTON,"And so, beside my bed I knelt"
5222,BOSTON,"While early morn was dim,"
5223,BOSTON,Imploring Heaven to teach my soul
5224,BOSTON,The way to turn to Him;
5225,BOSTON,
5226,BOSTON,"And now, behold! through golden clouds,"
5227,BOSTON,"A pierced hand I see,"
5228,BOSTON,"And listen to a glorious Voice,"
5229,BOSTON,"Arise! and come to Me."""
5230,BOSTON,
5231,BOSTON,"His breath grew faint, but soft and low"
5232,BOSTON,"The parting whisper sigh'd,"
5233,BOSTON,"""I come, dear Lord, I come!"" and so,"
5234,BOSTON,Without a pang he died.
5235,BOSTON,
5236,BOSTON,Oh blessed child! with whom the strife
5237,BOSTON,"Of fear and care are o'er,"
5238,BOSTON,Methinks thine angel smile we see
5239,BOSTON,"From yon celestial shore,"
5240,BOSTON,
5241,BOSTON,And hear thee singing to His praise
5242,BOSTON,Whose boundless mercy gave
5243,BOSTON,"Unto thy meek and trusting soul,"
5244,BOSTON,The victory o'er the Grave.
5245,BOSTON,
5246,BOSTON,
5247,BOSTON,
5248,BOSTON,
5249,BOSTON,The Precocious Infant.
5250,BOSTON,
5251,BOSTON,
5252,BOSTON,"The infant of whom the following traits will be remembered by many, was"
5253,BOSTON,"the son of the Rev. Dr. H. N. Brinsmade, and born in Hartford,"
5254,BOSTON,"Connecticut, February 28th, 1827. At an age when babes are considered"
5255,BOSTON,"little more than attractive objects to the loving eye, or toys to amuse"
5256,BOSTON,"a leisure hour, he was acquiring new ideas, and a subject of discipline;"
5257,BOSTON,"for his parents became convinced, through his example, that the mind in"
5258,BOSTON,its earliest developments is susceptible of culture.
5259,BOSTON,
5260,BOSTON,"From the age of four months, he was observed to regard surrounding"
5261,BOSTON,"objects with a fixed attention. During those periods of inspection, the"
5262,BOSTON,"name of the article thus regarded was slowly repeated to him, until he"
5263,BOSTON,"associated it with the sound, and afterwards, would earnestly turn his"
5264,BOSTON,"eyes to any prominent piece of furniture, or particular portions of his"
5265,BOSTON,"own dress, or parts of his body, when designated by their respective"
5266,BOSTON,"names. At ten months he commenced learning the alphabet, from small"
5267,BOSTON,"wooden cubes, on which each letter was separately painted. This process"
5268,BOSTON,was soon completed: not that he was able to utter the corresponding
5269,BOSTON,"sounds, but would point out any letter that was inquired for, without"
5270,BOSTON,"mistake; and if he saw one in an inverted position, was never easy until"
5271,BOSTON,he had restored it to its true attitude.
5272,BOSTON,
5273,BOSTON,"By the aid of prints pasted on cards, he readily acquired the names of"
5274,BOSTON,"animals and birds, arranged according to a judicious system of Natural"
5275,BOSTON,History. He was encouraged to become thoroughly familiar with one print
5276,BOSTON,ere he was permitted to take another. Thus a basis was laid for habits
5277,BOSTON,"of application, and the idle curiosity restrained, with which children"
5278,BOSTON,are wont to wander from picture to picture. His parents in showing him a
5279,BOSTON,"landscape or historical painting, accustomed him to regard every object,"
5280,BOSTON,"however minute, with an accurate eye, and so retentive was his memory,"
5281,BOSTON,that what had been thoroughly impressed he seldom forgot. There were few
5282,BOSTON,"toys from which he derived satisfaction, but seemed to find in pictures"
5283,BOSTON,"and books, with the explanations which they elicited, his principal"
5284,BOSTON,"delight. His careful treatment of books was remarkable, and this was"
5285,BOSTON,undoubtedly in a measure produced by a little circumstance which
5286,BOSTON,occurred when he was quite young. He had torn the paper cover of a small
5287,BOSTON,"volume. His mother remarked upon it with a serious countenance, and as"
5288,BOSTON,"the members of the family entered, mentioned what had been done, in a"
5289,BOSTON,tone of sadness.
5290,BOSTON,
5291,BOSTON,"Presently his lip quivered, and a tear glistened in his eye. The lesson"
5292,BOSTON,"had been sufficiently strong, and it was necessary to comfort him."
5293,BOSTON,"Afterwards, expensive volumes were fearlessly submitted to him, and the"
5294,BOSTON,most splendid English annuals sustained no injury from his repeated
5295,BOSTON,examinations.
5296,BOSTON,
5297,BOSTON,"Geography, as exhibited on maps, became a favourite study, and ere he"
5298,BOSTON,"had numbered his second birthday, I saw him with surprise and admiration"
5299,BOSTON,"point out upon an atlas, seas, rivers, lakes, and countries, without"
5300,BOSTON,hesitation or error.
5301,BOSTON,
5302,BOSTON,"A short time after, I found that he had made acquaintance with the"
5303,BOSTON,"rudiments of geometry, and was continually increasing his knowledge of"
5304,BOSTON,"printed words, which, with their definitions and combinations in simple"
5305,BOSTON,"phrases, were rapidly initiating him into his native language. It may"
5306,BOSTON,"possibly be imagined that he was made a mere book-worm, or might have"
5307,BOSTON,"been naturally deficient in animal spirits. On the contrary, nothing was"
5308,BOSTON,"taught him by compulsion, and no child could be more full of happiness."
5309,BOSTON,"His sports, his rambles in the garden, and the demonstrations of"
5310,BOSTON,"infantine pleasure, were sweet to him. His mother was his companion, his"
5311,BOSTON,"playmate, and his instructress. Deeming her child's mind of more value"
5312,BOSTON,"than any other feminine pursuit or enjoyment, she devoted her time to"
5313,BOSTON,its cultivation; and to her perseverance and the entire concurrence of
5314,BOSTON,"his father in the intellectual system devised for him, his uncommon"
5315,BOSTON,"attainments may be imputed, more than to any peculiar gift of nature."
5316,BOSTON,"Still, I am not prepared to say, that there was not something originally"
5317,BOSTON,"extraordinary in his capacity; at least I have never seen his docility,"
5318,BOSTON,"application, and retentive power, equalled in the early stages of"
5319,BOSTON,"existence. Portions of every day, suited in their length to his infancy,"
5320,BOSTON,were regularly devoted to the business of instruction. But these were
5321,BOSTON,"often unconsciously extended in their limits, by his eager desire to"
5322,BOSTON,"learn something more; and the winning and repeated entreaty of ""Pray,"
5323,BOSTON,"_dear mother_, teach me,"" was wont to secure him an additional"
5324,BOSTON,"indulgence of ""line upon line, and precept upon precept."" His love of"
5325,BOSTON,"knowledge was becoming a passion, still there seemed no undue prominence"
5326,BOSTON,"of one department of intellect to the injury of another. Perception,"
5327,BOSTON,"understanding, and memory, advanced together, and seemed equally"
5328,BOSTON,healthful.
5329,BOSTON,
5330,BOSTON,He was destined for a learned education; a great part of which it was
5331,BOSTON,deemed preferable that he should receive under the parental roof; and
5332,BOSTON,his mother was preparing herself to become an assistant to his father in
5333,BOSTON,teaching him different languages. So indefatigable were her attentions
5334,BOSTON,"to him, that she never left him to the care of a servant; and thus"
5335,BOSTON,"correct habits and purity of feeling, were preserved from contamination."
5336,BOSTON,
5337,BOSTON,"Among the pleasing traits of character which revealed themselves in him,"
5338,BOSTON,"his love of home was conspicuous. Though fond of seeing new objects, yet"
5339,BOSTON,"home was the spot most desirable to him. During a journey to New York,"
5340,BOSTON,"after the completion of his second year, where museums, and every"
5341,BOSTON,"alluring curiosity were inspected by him with delighted attention, the"
5342,BOSTON,"prospect of returning to his own flowers, shells, and books, gave him"
5343,BOSTON,inexpressible joy.
5344,BOSTON,
5345,BOSTON,He also manifested great ardour of affection for his parents. He could
5346,BOSTON,form no idea of happiness independent of their presence and
5347,BOSTON,"participation. Though exceedingly fond of seeing collections of animals,"
5348,BOSTON,which his knowledge of Natural History led him to regard with peculiar
5349,BOSTON,"interest, he insisted that his father should take him from the first"
5350,BOSTON,"exhibition of the kind which he had ever witnessed, and when he was"
5351,BOSTON,"highly entertained by an elephant, ostrich, and some monkeys, because he"
5352,BOSTON,discovered that his mother had withdrawn. The attachment usually felt by
5353,BOSTON,"children for the tender guides of their infant hours, seemed in his case"
5354,BOSTON,heightened by the consciousness that they were the dispensers of that
5355,BOSTON,knowledge with whose love he was smitten. When heaven was represented to
5356,BOSTON,"him as a delightful abode, and rendered still more alluring by the image"
5357,BOSTON,"of a beloved and departed relative, whom he was taught to consider as"
5358,BOSTON,"among its inhabitants, he would express his unwillingness to be removed"
5359,BOSTON,"there unless ""dear father and mother would go too."""
5360,BOSTON,
5361,BOSTON,"A grateful spirit seemed to mingle with his filial affection, and moved"
5362,BOSTON,him to an expression of thanks for every little favour. When given only
5363,BOSTON,"a piece of bread, if a few moments happened to intervene between its"
5364,BOSTON,"reception and the customary acknowledgment, he would inquire as if"
5365,BOSTON,"troubled at the omission, ""Did I forget to thank mother?"" He was often"
5366,BOSTON,"told that to his Father in heaven, he was indebted for what he most"
5367,BOSTON,"loved, and with an affecting earnestness and graceful gesture of his"
5368,BOSTON,"little head, would say, ""_Thank God_."" At the period of family devotion"
5369,BOSTON,"he was early taught a quiet and reverent deportment, and after books"
5370,BOSTON,"became so interesting to him, preferred to look over when his father"
5371,BOSTON,"read the Scriptures, and to have it spread before him when he knelt"
5372,BOSTON,during the prayer.
5373,BOSTON,
5374,BOSTON,"It might possibly have been feared that the mind, by starting into such"
5375,BOSTON,"sudden expansion, would have left the heart at a distance, but the germs"
5376,BOSTON,of gentleness and virtue kept pace with the growth of intellect. There
5377,BOSTON,"was also preserved a fine and fortunate balance between mind and body,"
5378,BOSTON,for his physical education had been considered an important department
5379,BOSTON,"of parental care and responsibility. His erect form, and expanded chest,"
5380,BOSTON,"revealed the rudiments of a good constitution, while his fair brow,"
5381,BOSTON,"bright black eye, and playful smile, bespoke that union of health,"
5382,BOSTON,"beauty, and cheerfulness, which never failed of attracting attention."
5383,BOSTON,There was less of light and boisterous mirth about him than is common to
5384,BOSTON,children of his age. His features expressed rather a mild and rational
5385,BOSTON,happiness than any exuberance of joy. This might have arisen partly from
5386,BOSTON,the circumstance of his having no young companion to encourage wild or
5387,BOSTON,"extravagant sports; but principally, that the pleasures of thought were"
5388,BOSTON,"so continually resorted to, as to modify and elevate the countenance."
5389,BOSTON,"His whole appearance was that of a healthful, happy, and beautiful"
5390,BOSTON,"infant, in the possession of a degree of learning and intelligence, to"
5391,BOSTON,which infancy usually has no pretensions.
5392,BOSTON,
5393,BOSTON,But it was forbidden us to witness the result of this interesting
5394,BOSTON,experiment upon mind; or to trace the full development of a bud whose
5395,BOSTON,unfolding was so wonderful. An acute dysentery which prevailed in the
5396,BOSTON,"neighbourhood, numbered him among its victims, and after a fortnight's"
5397,BOSTON,"painful languishing, he died on the 11th of August, 1829, at the age of"
5398,BOSTON,two years and five months.
5399,BOSTON,
5400,BOSTON,"After the breath had forsaken him he was still lovely, though emaciated."
5401,BOSTON,"Fresh roses and orange flowers were around his head and on his bosom,"
5402,BOSTON,and a bud clasped in his snowy hand. He seemed like one who had suffered
5403,BOSTON,"and fallen asleep, and there lingered a peaceful and patient spirit"
5404,BOSTON,"around his silent wasted lips. His mother was seated by her dead son,"
5405,BOSTON,"pale, but resigned. She had never been separated from him since his"
5406,BOSTON,"birth, and she wished to continue near him till the grave should claim"
5407,BOSTON,"its own. The parents were strengthened as true Christians, to yield"
5408,BOSTON,their only one to the will of his Father in heaven. And the anguish of
5409,BOSTON,"their affliction was undoubtedly mitigated by the recollection, that"
5410,BOSTON,nothing in their power had been omitted to promote his improvement and
5411,BOSTON,"heighten his felicity, and that his dwelling was now to be where"
5412,BOSTON,"knowledge is no longer gained by slow laborious efforts, but where light"
5413,BOSTON,"is without cloud, and the soaring soul freed from its encumbrances of"
5414,BOSTON,clay.

5423,BOSTON,"As from the garden's shade,"
5424,BOSTON,"With golden ringlets clustering bright,"
5425,BOSTON,"She burst upon the mother's sight,"
5426,BOSTON,"And in her hand, like fairy sprite,"
5427,BOSTON,A blooming rose-bud laid.
5428,BOSTON,
5429,BOSTON,'Twas the last wreath by summer wove
5430,BOSTON,"That thus the darling brought,"
5431,BOSTON,For Autumn's breath had chill'd the grove;
5432,BOSTON,Oh mother! was that gift of love
5433,BOSTON,With aught of sadness fraught?
5434,BOSTON,
5435,BOSTON,"Say, didst thou think how soon that head"

5437,BOSTON,"A solemn curtain o'er it spread,"
5438,BOSTON,"And the green turf she joy'd to tread,"
5439,BOSTON,A covering for her breast?

5442,BOSTON,"Look thou in faith above,"

5452,BOSTON,
5453,BOSTON,
5454,BOSTON,"Among the bright-robed host of heaven, two cherubs were filled with new"
5455,BOSTON,rapture. Gladness that mortal eye hath never seen beamed from their
5456,BOSTON,"brows, as with tuneful voices they exclaimed,"
5457,BOSTON,
5458,BOSTON,"""Joy! joy! He cometh! Welcome, welcome, dear brother!"" And they clasped"
5459,BOSTON,in their arms a new immortal.
5460,BOSTON,
5461,BOSTON,"Then to their golden harps they chanted, ""Thou shalt weep no more, our"
5462,BOSTON,"brother, neither shall sickness smite thee. For here is no death,"
5463,BOSTON,"neither sorrow, nor sighing."""
5464,BOSTON,
5465,BOSTON,"At the Saviour's feet they knelt together with their warbled strain,"
5466,BOSTON,"""Praise be unto Thee, who didst say, 'Suffer little children to come"
5467,BOSTON,unto Me.'
5468,BOSTON,
5469,BOSTON,"""Thou didst take them to Thy bosom upon earth, and through Thy love they"
5470,BOSTON,"enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Endless praise and glory be Thine, Oh"
5471,BOSTON,"Lord most High!"""
5472,BOSTON,
5473,BOSTON,"They led the little one to amaranthine bowers, and wreathed around his"
5474,BOSTON,temples the flowers that never fade. They gave him of the fruit of the
5475,BOSTON,"Tree of Life, and of the water that gusheth forth clear as crystal from"
5476,BOSTON,before the Throne of God and of the Lamb.
5477,BOSTON,
5478,BOSTON,"And they said, ""Beautiful one! who wert too young to lisp the dialect of"
5479,BOSTON,"earth, sweet to thee will be the pure language of heaven. Bringest thou"
5480,BOSTON,"to us no token from the world that was once our home?"""
5481,BOSTON,
5482,BOSTON,"Then answered the babe-cherub, ""Here is our mother's last kiss with a"
5483,BOSTON,"tear upon it, and the prayer with which our father gave me back to God."""
5484,BOSTON,
5485,BOSTON,"And they said, ""Their gifts are sweet to us. We remember _her_ smile who"
5486,BOSTON,"lulled us on her breast, whose eye was open through the long night, when"
5487,BOSTON,sickness smote us; and _his_ voice who taught us the name of Jesus.
5488,BOSTON,
5489,BOSTON,Oft-times do we hover about them. We are near them though they see us
5490,BOSTON,not. While they mourn we drop into their hearts a balm drop and a
5491,BOSTON,"thought of heaven, and fly back hither, swifter than the wing of"
5492,BOSTON,morning.
5493,BOSTON,
5494,BOSTON,"We keep watch at the shining gates for them, and for the white-haired"
5495,BOSTON,"parents whom they honour, and for our fair sister, that we may be the"
5496,BOSTON,"first to welcome them. Lo! when all are here, our joy shall be full."""
5497,BOSTON,
5498,BOSTON,"Long they talked together, folding their rainbow wings. They talked long"
5499,BOSTON,"with their music tones, yet the darkness came not. For there is no night"
5500,BOSTON,there.
5501,BOSTON,
5502,BOSTON,"Then there burst forth a great song, choirs of angels saying, ""Holy,"
5503,BOSTON,"holy, holy Lord God Almighty: Just and true are thy ways, thou King of"
5504,BOSTON,"Saints."" And the lyres of the cherub brothers joined the chorus,"
5505,BOSTON,swelling the melody of heaven.

5513,BOSTON,"A babe, who like the opening bud"
5514,BOSTON,"Grew fairer day by day,"
5515,BOSTON,Made friendship with the loving flowers
5516,BOSTON,Amid his infant play;
5517,BOSTON,
5518,BOSTON,And though full many a gorgeous plant
5519,BOSTON,"Display'd its colours bright,"
5520,BOSTON,Yet with the meek Forget-me-not
5521,BOSTON,He took his chief delight.
5522,BOSTON,
5523,BOSTON,"From mantel-vase, or rich bouquet,"
5524,BOSTON,"He cull'd his favourite gem,"
5525,BOSTON,"Well pleas'd its lowly lips to kiss,"
5526,BOSTON,And gently clasp its stem.
5527,BOSTON,
5528,BOSTON,"So, when to dreamless rest he sank,"
5529,BOSTON,"For soon he was to fade,"
5530,BOSTON,"That darling friend, Forget-me-not,"
5531,BOSTON,Was on his bosom laid;
5532,BOSTON,
5533,BOSTON,"And when, beside the mother's couch,"
5534,BOSTON,"Who weepeth for his sake,"
5535,BOSTON,Some vision of his heavenly joy
5536,BOSTON,"Doth midnight darkness break,"
5537,BOSTON,
5538,BOSTON,He cometh with a cherub smile
5539,BOSTON,"In garments of the bless'd,"

5546,BOSTON,Treatment of Animals.
5547,BOSTON,
5548,BOSTON,
5549,BOSTON,"A grateful disposition, should teach us to be kind to the domestic"
5550,BOSTON,animals. They add much to our comfort. How should we bear the winter's
5551,BOSTON,"cold, were it not for the coat of wool, which the sheep shares with us?"
5552,BOSTON,"How would journeys be performed, or the mail be carried, or the affairs"
5553,BOSTON,"of government be conducted, without the aid of the horse?"
5554,BOSTON,
5555,BOSTON,Did you ever think how much the comfort of families depends upon the
5556,BOSTON,"cow? Make a list of articles for the table, or for the sick, to which"
5557,BOSTON,milk is indispensable. Perhaps you will be surprised to find how
5558,BOSTON,numerous they are.
5559,BOSTON,
5560,BOSTON,"When the first settlers of New England, came to Plymouth, in the winter"
5561,BOSTON,"of 1620, four years elapsed, before any cows were brought them. During"
5562,BOSTON,"all this time, their bread was made of pounded corn, and they had not a"
5563,BOSTON,"drop of milk for the weaned infant, or the sickly child, or to make any"
5564,BOSTON,little delicacy for the invalid.
5565,BOSTON,
5566,BOSTON,"There was great rejoicing in the colony, when a ship arrived, bringing a"
5567,BOSTON,few small heifers. Remember how patiently our good ancestors endured
5568,BOSTON,their many hardships; and when you freely use the milk of which they
5569,BOSTON,"were so long deprived, be kind to the peaceable, orderly quadruped, from"
5570,BOSTON,whom it is obtained.
5571,BOSTON,
5572,BOSTON,"Domestic animals, are sensible of kindness, and improved by it. They are"
5573,BOSTON,"made happier and more gentle, by being caressed and spoken to with a"
5574,BOSTON,"pleasant voice. Food, shelter, needful rest, and good treatment, are"
5575,BOSTON,"surely due to them, for their many services to man."
5576,BOSTON,
5577,BOSTON,"The Arab treats his horse like his child, and the noble animal loves"
5578,BOSTON,"him, and strains every nerve to do his bidding. I have seen a horse,"
5579,BOSTON,"when wearied with heat and travel, erect his head, and show evident"
5580,BOSTON,"signs of pleasure, and renew his labours with fresh zeal, if his master"
5581,BOSTON,"patted his neck, and whispered with a kind voice into his ear."
5582,BOSTON,
5583,BOSTON,It is delightful to see the young show a protecting kindness to such
5584,BOSTON,harmless creatures as are often harshly treated. It seems difficult to
5585,BOSTON,say why the toad is so generally singled out for strong dislike. Is it
5586,BOSTON,only because Nature has not given it beauty? Surely its habits are
5587,BOSTON,"innocent, and its temper gentle."
5588,BOSTON,
5589,BOSTON,The scientific gardeners of Europe encourage toads to live in their
5590,BOSTON,"gardens, and about their green-houses. They find them useful assistants"
5591,BOSTON,"in guarding their precious plants from insects. So, they wisely make"
5592,BOSTON,"them allies, instead of torturing and destroying them."
5593,BOSTON,
5594,BOSTON,"A benevolent English gentleman, once took pains to reclaim a toad from"
5595,BOSTON,its timid habits. It improved by his attentions. It grew to a very large
5596,BOSTON,"size, and at his approach, came regularly from its hole, to meet him,"
5597,BOSTON,and receive its food.
5598,BOSTON,
5599,BOSTON,"Ladies, who visited the garden, sometimes desired to see this singular"
5600,BOSTON,"favourite. It was even brought to the table, and permitted to have a"
5601,BOSTON,"dessert of insects, which it partook, without being embarrassed by the"
5602,BOSTON,presence of company.
5603,BOSTON,
5604,BOSTON,"It lived to be forty years old. What age it might have attained, had it"
5605,BOSTON,"met with no accident, it would be difficult to say. For it was in"
5606,BOSTON,"perfect health when wounded by a fierce raven, as it one day was coming"
5607,BOSTON,"from its house, under the steps of the door, which fronted the garden."
5608,BOSTON,
5609,BOSTON,"The poor creature languished a while, and then died; and the benevolent"
5610,BOSTON,"man who had so long protected it, took pleasure in relating its history,"
5611,BOSTON,and in remembering that he had made its life happy.
5612,BOSTON,
5613,BOSTON,Cruelty to animals is disgraceful and sinful. If I see even a young
5614,BOSTON,"child pull off the wings of an insect, or take pains to set his foot"
5615,BOSTON,"upon a worm, I know that he has not been well instructed, or else that"
5616,BOSTON,there is something wrong and wicked in his heart.
5617,BOSTON,
5618,BOSTON,"The Emperor Domitian loved to kill flies, and at last became a monster"
5619,BOSTON,"of cruelty. Benedict Arnold, the traitor, when he was a boy, liked to"
5620,BOSTON,"give pain to every thing, over which he could get power."
5621,BOSTON,
5622,BOSTON,"He destroyed birds' nests, and cut the little unfledged ones in pieces,"
5623,BOSTON,"before the eyes of their agonised parents. Cats and dogs, the quiet cow,"
5624,BOSTON,"and the faithful horse, he delighted to hurt and distress."
5625,BOSTON,
5626,BOSTON,I do not like to repeat his cruel deeds. He was told that they were
5627,BOSTON,"wrong. An excellent lady with whom he lived, use to warn and reprove"
5628,BOSTON,"him. But he did not reform. For his heart was hard, and he did not heed"
5629,BOSTON,the commands of God.
5630,BOSTON,
5631,BOSTON,"He grew up without good principles. He became a soldier, and had command"
5632,BOSTON,"in the army. But he laid a plan to betray his country, and sell it into"
5633,BOSTON,the hands of the enemy.
5634,BOSTON,
5635,BOSTON,"His wickedness was discovered, and he fled. He never dared to return to"
5636,BOSTON,"his native land, but lived despised, and died in misery. We know not how"
5637,BOSTON,"much of the sin which disgraced his character, sprang out of his"
5638,BOSTON,"hardness of heart, and cruelty to animals."
5639,BOSTON,
5640,BOSTON,Many of the inferior creation display virtues which are deserving of
5641,BOSTON,respect. How many remarkable instances have we heard of the sagacity of
5642,BOSTON,"the elephant, and the grateful attachment and fidelity of the dog."
5643,BOSTON,
5644,BOSTON,"A shepherd, who lived at the foot of the Grampian mountains, one day, in"
5645,BOSTON,"going to look after his flock, took with him his little boy of four"
5646,BOSTON,"years old. Some of his sheep had strayed. In pursuing them, he was"
5647,BOSTON,"obliged to climb rocks, so steep, that the child could not follow."
5648,BOSTON,
5649,BOSTON,"The shepherd charged the child to remain where he left him, until he"
5650,BOSTON,"should return. But while he was gone, one of those thick fogs arose,"
5651,BOSTON,which in that part of Scotland are not uncommon. With difficulty he
5652,BOSTON,groped his way back again. But the child was gone.
5653,BOSTON,
5654,BOSTON,All his search was vain. There was sorrow that night in the lowly
5655,BOSTON,"cottage of his parents. The next day, the neighbours joined, and"
5656,BOSTON,continued their pursuit for several days and nights. But in vain.
5657,BOSTON,
5658,BOSTON,"""Is my dog lost too?"" said the father, as he one day entered his"
5659,BOSTON,"dwelling, and sat down in weariness and despair. ""He has come here"
5660,BOSTON,"daily,"" said his little daughter, ""while you and mother, have been"
5661,BOSTON,"searching for poor Donald. I have given him a piece of cake, which he"
5662,BOSTON,"has taken, and ran hastily away."""
5663,BOSTON,
5664,BOSTON,"The household bread of the poor, in Scotland, is made of oatmeal, and"
5665,BOSTON,"being not baked in loaves, but rolled out thin, is often called cake."
5666,BOSTON,"While they were speaking, the dog rushed in, and leaped upon his master,"
5667,BOSTON,whining earnestly.
5668,BOSTON,
5669,BOSTON,An oatmeal cake was given him. He appeared hungry but ate only a small
5670,BOSTON,"portion of it. The remainder he took in his mouth, and ran away. The"
5671,BOSTON,"shepherd followed him. It was with difficulty, that he kept his track,"
5672,BOSTON,"fording a swift streamlet, and descending into a terrible ravine."
5673,BOSTON,
5674,BOSTON,"Then he entered a cave. And what was his joy to see there his little,"
5675,BOSTON,lost son. He was eating heartily the bread which the dog had brought
5676,BOSTON,"him, while he, standing by, and wagging his tail, looked up in his face"
5677,BOSTON,"with delight, as he took the food, which he nobly denied himself."
5678,BOSTON,
5679,BOSTON,"It seems that the dog was with the child, when, in the dimness of the"
5680,BOSTON,"mist, he wandered away. He must have aided him to pass the deep waters"
5681,BOSTON,"that crossed his path. And when he found shelter in that rude cavern,"
5682,BOSTON,"and mourned for his parents, the faithful dog guarded him like a father,"
5683,BOSTON,and fed him with a mother's tenderness.
5684,BOSTON,
5685,BOSTON,"How can we fail to treat with kindness, a race of animals, that are"
5686,BOSTON,"capable of such virtues. Others, that are less celebrated, often show"
5687,BOSTON,"traits of character, which are worthy of imitation. Let us hear the"
5688,BOSTON,"opinion of the poet Cowper, on this interesting subject."
5689,BOSTON,
5690,BOSTON,"""We too might learn, if not too proud to stoop"
5691,BOSTON,"To animal instructors, many a good"
5692,BOSTON,"And useful quality, and virtue too,"
5693,BOSTON,Rarely exemplified among ourselves.
5694,BOSTON,"Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat"
5695,BOSTON,"Can move, or warp, and gratitude for small"
5696,BOSTON,"And trivial favours, lasting as the life,"
5697,BOSTON,"And glistening even from the dying eye."""
5698,BOSTON,
5699,BOSTON,Birds give us an example of tender affection. There is no warfare in
5700,BOSTON,"their nests. The little brothers and sisters dwell together in harmony,"
5701,BOSTON,"till they are able to stretch out the newly-plumed wing, and quit the"
5702,BOSTON,"care of the parent. Say they not to us, as they sing among the branches,"
5703,BOSTON,"""_Live in love!_"""
5704,BOSTON,
5705,BOSTON,"The innocent dove, is cited as a model in the Book of God. ""Be ye"
5706,BOSTON,"harmless as doves,"" said our Saviour, to his disciples. The stork"
5707,BOSTON,"spreads out its broad pinions, and bears its aged parents, on their"
5708,BOSTON,"journey through the air. It feeds and cherishes them with the same care,"
5709,BOSTON,that it received in its own helpless infancy. Shall we not learn from it
5710,BOSTON,a lesson of filial piety?
5711,BOSTON,
5712,BOSTON,"Once, a robin, in returning to her nest, was shot dead. The mate mourned"
5713,BOSTON,"bitterly for her loss, but took her place upon the nest. There he"
5714,BOSTON,"brooded, until the young came forth from the egg, and then he sought"
5715,BOSTON,"food, and fed them like a mother, until they were able to fly away."
5716,BOSTON,
5717,BOSTON,"Often while he was performing her duties, and always at the close of"
5718,BOSTON,"day, his plaintive note was heard, lamenting his lost love. Ah! who"
5719,BOSTON,"could be so wicked as to destroy the nest, or the eggs, or the young, of"

5729,BOSTON,"It was the day before Christmas, in the year 1778, during our war of"
5730,BOSTON,"revolution, that an armed vessel sailed out of Boston. She was strongly"
5731,BOSTON,"built, and carried twenty guns, and a crew of one hundred and five"
5732,BOSTON,persons; with provisions for a cruise of six months.
5733,BOSTON,
5734,BOSTON,"She made a fine appearance, as she spread her broad sails, and steered"
5735,BOSTON,out of the harbour. Many hearts wished her success. And she bore as
5736,BOSTON,"goodly a company of bold and skilful seamen, as ever braved the perils"
5737,BOSTON,of the deep.
5738,BOSTON,
5739,BOSTON,"Soon the north wind blew, and brought a heavy sea into the bay. The"
5740,BOSTON,"night proved dark, and they came to anchor with difficulty, near the"
5741,BOSTON,"harbour of Plymouth. The strong gale that buffeted them became a storm,"
5742,BOSTON,and the storm a hurricane.
5743,BOSTON,
5744,BOSTON,"Snow fell, and the cold was terribly severe. The vessel was driven from"
5745,BOSTON,"her moorings, and struck on a reef of rocks. She began to fill with"
5746,BOSTON,"water, and they were obliged to cut away her masts. The sea rose above"
5747,BOSTON,"her main deck, sweeping over it with its dark surges."
5748,BOSTON,
5749,BOSTON,"They made every exertion that courage could prompt, or hardihood endure."
5750,BOSTON,"But so fearful were the wind and cold, that the stoutest man was not"
5751,BOSTON,"able to strike more than two or three blows, in cutting away the masts,"
5752,BOSTON,without being relieved by another.
5753,BOSTON,
5754,BOSTON,"The wretched people thronged together upon the quarter-deck, which was"
5755,BOSTON,crowded almost to suffocation. They were exhausted with toil and
5756,BOSTON,"suffering, but could obtain neither provisions, nor fresh water. These"
5757,BOSTON,"were all covered by the deep sea, when the vessel became a wreck."
5758,BOSTON,
5759,BOSTON,"But, unfortunately, the crew got access to ardent spirits, and many of"
5760,BOSTON,"them drank, and became intoxicated. Insubordination, mutiny, and madness"
5761,BOSTON,"ensued. The officers, remained clear-minded, but lost all authority over"
5762,BOSTON,"the crew, who raved around them."
5763,BOSTON,
5764,BOSTON,"A more frightful scene, can scarcely be imagined: the dark sky, the"
5765,BOSTON,"raging storm, the waves breaking wildly over the rocks, and threatening"
5766,BOSTON,every moment to swallow up the broken vessel; and the half-frozen beings
5767,BOSTON,"who maintained their icy hold on life, lost to reason, and to duty, or"
5768,BOSTON,fighting fiercely with each other.
5769,BOSTON,
5770,BOSTON,"Some lay in disgusting stupidity; others, with fiery faces, blasphemed"

5773,BOSTON,"supposed, refused to do their bidding."
5774,BOSTON,
5775,BOSTON,"Others there were, who, amid the beating of that pitiless tempest,"
5776,BOSTON,"believed themselves in the homes that they never more must see, and with"
5777,BOSTON,"hollow, reproachful voices, besought bread, and wondered why water was"
5778,BOSTON,withheld from them by the hands that were most dear.
5779,BOSTON,
5780,BOSTON,"A few, whose worst passions were quickened by alcohol to a fiend-like"
5781,BOSTON,"fury, assaulted or wounded those who came in their way, making their"
5782,BOSTON,"shrieks of defiance, and their curses heard above the roar of the"

5784,BOSTON,attitudes.
5785,BOSTON,
5786,BOSTON,"At length, Death began to do his work. The miserable creatures fell"
5787,BOSTON,"every hour upon the deck, frozen, stiff, and hard. Each corpse, as it"

5797,BOSTON,"Many lay in a vast pile. Others sat, with their heads reclining on their"
5798,BOSTON,"knees; others, grasping the ice-covered ropes; some in a posture of"
5799,BOSTON,"defence like the dying gladiator: and others, with hands held up to"
5800,BOSTON,"heaven, as if deprecating their awful fate."
5801,BOSTON,
5802,BOSTON,Orders were given to search earnestly for every mark or sign of life.
5803,BOSTON,"One boy was distinguished amid a mass of dead, only by the trembling of"
5804,BOSTON,one of his eyelids. The poor survivors were kindly received into the
5805,BOSTON,"houses of the people of Plymouth, and every effort used for their"
5806,BOSTON,restoration.
5807,BOSTON,
5808,BOSTON,"The captain and lieutenant, and a few others, who had abstained from the"
5809,BOSTON,"use of ardent spirits, survived. The remainder were buried, some in"
5810,BOSTON,"separate graves, and others in a large pit, whose hollow is still to be"
5811,BOSTON,"seen, on the south-west side of the burial ground in Plymouth."
5812,BOSTON,
5813,BOSTON,"The funeral obsequies were most solemn. When the clergyman, who was to"
5814,BOSTON,"perform the last services, first entered the church, and saw more than"
5815,BOSTON,"seventy dead bodies; some fixing upon him their stony eyes, and others,"
5816,BOSTON,"with faces, stiffened into the horrible expression of their last mortal"
5817,BOSTON,"agony, he was so affected as to faint."
5818,BOSTON,
5819,BOSTON,"Some, were brought on shore alive, and received every attention, but"
5820,BOSTON,"survived only a short time. Others, were restored after long sickness,"
5821,BOSTON,"but with limbs so injured by frost, as to become cripples for life."
5822,BOSTON,
5823,BOSTON,"In a village, at some distance from Plymouth, a widowed mother, with her"
5824,BOSTON,"daughter, were seen constantly attending a couch, on which lay a"
5825,BOSTON,"sufferer. It was the boy, whose trembling eyelid attracted the notice of"
5826,BOSTON,"pity, as he lay among the dead."
5827,BOSTON,
5828,BOSTON,"""Mother,"" he said in a feeble tone, ""God bless you for having taught me"
5829,BOSTON,to avoid ardent spirits. It was this that saved me. After those around
5830,BOSTON,"me grew intoxicated, I had enough to do to protect myself from them."
5831,BOSTON,
5832,BOSTON,"""Some attacked, and dared me to fight; others pressed the poisonous"
5833,BOSTON,"draught to my lips, and bade me drink. My lips and throat were parched"
5834,BOSTON,"with thirst. But I knew if I drank with them, I must lose my reason as"
5835,BOSTON,"they did, and perhaps, blaspheme my Maker."
5836,BOSTON,
5837,BOSTON,"""One by one they died, those poor infuriated wretches. Their shrieks and"
5838,BOSTON,"groans, still seem to ring in my ears. It was in vain that the captain"
5839,BOSTON,"and their officers, and a few good men, warned them of what would ensue,"
5840,BOSTON,"if they thus continued to drink, and tried every method in their power,"
5841,BOSTON,to restore them to order.
5842,BOSTON,
5843,BOSTON,"""They still fed upon the fiery liquor. They grew delirious. They died in"
5844,BOSTON,"heaps. Dear mother, our sufferings from hunger and cold, you cannot"
5845,BOSTON,"imagine. After my feet were frozen, but before I lost the use of my"
5846,BOSTON,"hands, I discovered a box, among fragments of the wreck, far under"
5847,BOSTON,water.
5848,BOSTON,
5849,BOSTON,"""I toiled with a rope to drag it up. But my strength was not sufficient."
5850,BOSTON,"A comrade, who was still able to move a little, assisted me. At length,"
5851,BOSTON,"it came within our reach. We hoped that it might contain bread, and took"
5852,BOSTON,courage.
5853,BOSTON,
5854,BOSTON,"""Uniting our strength we burst it open. It contained only a few bottles"
5855,BOSTON,of olive oil. Yet we gave God thanks. For we found that by occasionally
5856,BOSTON,"moistening our lips with it, and swallowing a little, it allayed the"
5857,BOSTON,"gnawing, burning pain in the stomach."
5858,BOSTON,
5859,BOSTON,"""Then my comrade died. And I lay beside him, like a corpse, surrounded"
5860,BOSTON,"by corpses. Presently, the violence of the tempest, that had so long"
5861,BOSTON,"raged, subsided, and I heard quick footsteps, and strange voices amid"
5862,BOSTON,"the wreck, where we lay."
5863,BOSTON,
5864,BOSTON,"""They were the blessed people of Plymouth, who had dared every danger,"
5865,BOSTON,"to save us. They lifted in their arms, and wrapped in blankets, all who"
5866,BOSTON,could speak. Then they earnestly sought all who could move. But every
5867,BOSTON,"drunkard, was among the dead."
5868,BOSTON,
5869,BOSTON,"""And I was so exhausted with toil, and suffering, and cold, that I could"
5870,BOSTON,not stretch a hand to my deliverers. They passed me again and again.
5871,BOSTON,They carried the living to the boat. I feared that I was left behind.
5872,BOSTON,
5873,BOSTON,"""Then I prayed earnestly, in my heart, 'Oh, Lord, for the sake of my"
5874,BOSTON,"widowed mother, for the sake of my dear sister, save me.' I believed"
5875,BOSTON,"that the last man had gone, and besought the Redeemer to receive my"
5876,BOSTON,spirit.
5877,BOSTON,
5878,BOSTON,"""But I felt a warm breath on my face. I strained every nerve. My whole"
5879,BOSTON,soul strove and shuddered within me. Still my body was immovable as
5880,BOSTON,"marble. Then a loud voice said, 'Come back and help me out with this"
5881,BOSTON,poor lad. One of his eyelids trembles. He lives!'
5882,BOSTON,
5883,BOSTON,"""Oh, the music of that voice to me! The trembling eyelid, and the prayer"
5884,BOSTON,"to God, and your lessons of temperance, my mother, saved me."" Then the"
5885,BOSTON,"loving sister embraced him with tears, and the mother said, ""Praise be"
5886,BOSTON,"to Him who hath spared my son, to be the comfort of my old age."""

5892,BOSTON,
5893,BOSTON,
5894,BOSTON,The history of every nation tells of the shedding of blood. The most
5895,BOSTON,"ancient annals record ""wars and fightings,"" ever since man was placed"
5896,BOSTON,upon the earth. Both savage and civilized nations have prized the
5897,BOSTON,"trappings of the warrior, and coveted the glory of victory."
5898,BOSTON,
5899,BOSTON,"Yet have there always been some reflecting minds, to lament that the"
5900,BOSTON,"beings whom God had so nobly endowed, should delight to destroy each"
5901,BOSTON,"other. They have felt that there was suffering enough in the world,"
5902,BOSTON,without man's inflicting it on his brother; and that life was short
5903,BOSTON,"enough, without being made still shorter by violence."
5904,BOSTON,
5905,BOSTON,"Among the most warlike nations, there have been a few calm and"
5906,BOSTON,"philanthropic spirits, to perceive that war was an evil, or to deplore"
5907,BOSTON,"it as a judgment, even before the Gospel breathed ""good-will and peace,"""
5908,BOSTON,"in an angel's song. Though Rome grew up by bloodshed, and gained her"
5909,BOSTON,"dominion by the sword, yet some of her best emperors deplored the evils"
5910,BOSTON,of war.
5911,BOSTON,
5912,BOSTON,"Adrian loved peace, and endeavoured to promote it. He saw that war was a"
5913,BOSTON,"foe to those arts and sciences, through which nations become prosperous"
5914,BOSTON,"and refined. He felt that the cultivation of the earth, the pursuits of"
5915,BOSTON,"commerce, and the progress of intellect, must alike be obstructed and"
5916,BOSTON,"languish, while the business of men was in the field of battle."
5917,BOSTON,
5918,BOSTON,"Titus Antoninus Pius desired to live in peace with every one. ""I had"
5919,BOSTON,"rather save the life of one citizen,"" he nobly said, ""than destroy a"
5920,BOSTON,"thousand enemies."" His successor, Marcus Aurelius, considered war both"
5921,BOSTON,as a disgrace and calamity. Though the necessity of the times sometimes
5922,BOSTON,"forced him into it, his heart revolted, for he was inspired with the"
5923,BOSTON,love of learning and philosophy.
5924,BOSTON,
5925,BOSTON,Yet these were heathen emperors. They had never imbibed the spirit of
5926,BOSTON,"the Gospel. They were not followers of Him, whose last accents was a"
5927,BOSTON,"prayer for his murderers. The maxim of the ancient Jews was, ""an eye for"
5928,BOSTON,"an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."" But the precept of Jesus Christ is,"
5929,BOSTON,"""see that ye love one another."" The contentious spirit was not therefore"
5930,BOSTON,"condemned by the law of Moses, nor by the mythology of the heathen."
5931,BOSTON,
5932,BOSTON,"Have you ever thought much, my dear young friends, of the miseries of"
5933,BOSTON,war? of the waste of human life which it causes? of the bitter mourning
5934,BOSTON,"which it makes in families? You pity a friend who suffers pain, a poor"
5935,BOSTON,"cripple upon crutches, or even a child with a cut finger."
5936,BOSTON,
5937,BOSTON,"But, after a battle, what gashes and gaping wounds are seen, what"
5938,BOSTON,"multitudes of mangled carcases. How red is the earth with flowing blood,"
5939,BOSTON,"how terrible are the groans of the dying, trampled beneath the feet of"
5940,BOSTON,"horses, or suffocated under heaps of dead. How fearful to see strong men"
5941,BOSTON,"convulsed with agony, and imploring help in vain."
5942,BOSTON,
5943,BOSTON,"Think too, of the sorrow in their distant homes. Grey-headed parents,"
5944,BOSTON,"from whom the last prop is taken away, lamenting their sons fallen in"
5945,BOSTON,"battle. Wives mourning for their husbands, little children weeping"
5946,BOSTON,"because their fathers must return no more. Neighbourhoods, once happy"
5947,BOSTON,"and prosperous, plunged into poverty, by the loss of those who provided"
5948,BOSTON,them with bread.
5949,BOSTON,
5950,BOSTON,"All these evils, and many more, which we have neither room nor time to"
5951,BOSTON,"mention, may come from a single battle. Towns and cities are sometimes"
5952,BOSTON,"burned, and the aged and helpless destroyed. Mothers, and their innocent"
5953,BOSTON,"babes, perish in the ruins of their own beloved abodes."
5954,BOSTON,
5955,BOSTON,"War produces cruelty, and bad passions. Men, who have no cause to"
5956,BOSTON,"dislike each other, meet as deadly foes. They raise weapons of"
5957,BOSTON,"destruction, and exult in the misery they inflict. Rulers, should take a"
5958,BOSTON,"solemn view of the sufferings and sins of war, ere they plunge the"
5959,BOSTON,"people into it, for differences which might have been amicably settled."
5960,BOSTON,
5961,BOSTON,War is expensive. The political economist should therefore oppose it.
5962,BOSTON,"Great Britain, in her last war with France, is said to have spent more"
5963,BOSTON,"than seven hundred millions of pounds. But the immediate cost of armies,"
5964,BOSTON,is but a part of the expense of war.
5965,BOSTON,
5966,BOSTON,Who can compute the amount of losses by the obstruction of tillage and
5967,BOSTON,"commerce, and the waste of life; for every full-grown, able-bodied man,"

5973,BOSTON,"Howard, who felt that it was more noble to save life than to destroy it,"
5974,BOSTON,"visited the prisons of distant lands, to relieve such as have no helper;"
5975,BOSTON,"and blessings, in foreign languages, were poured upon his head."
5976,BOSTON,"Bonaparte caused multitudes to be slain and multitudes to mourn, and"
5977,BOSTON,"died in exile, on a desolate island. When death approached, to strip the"

5980,BOSTON,
5981,BOSTON,"The religious sect, who are called Friends, never engage in warfare. The"
5982,BOSTON,"State of Pennsylvania, was settled by them. William Penn, its founder,"
5983,BOSTON,"purchased it of the natives, and lived with them in amity. They gathered"
5984,BOSTON,"around him, with their dark, red brows, and, gazing earnestly in his"
5985,BOSTON,"face, said, ""You are our father. We love you."""
5986,BOSTON,
5987,BOSTON,"When he purchased the land of them, he appeared unarmed, under the"
5988,BOSTON,"spreading branches of a lofty oak, and conferred with their chiefs. He"
5989,BOSTON,"paid them to their satisfaction, gave them gifts, and entered into"
5990,BOSTON,"articles of friendship with them and their descendants. ""This is the"
5991,BOSTON,"only treaty which was confirmed without an oath,"" said an historian,"
5992,BOSTON,"""and the only one that was never broken."""
5993,BOSTON,
5994,BOSTON,"These men of peace, treated the sons of the forest as brethren. But in"
5995,BOSTON,"other colonies, there were distressing wars. The settlers carried their"
5996,BOSTON,"guns to the corn-field, and laboured in fear, for the safety of their"
5997,BOSTON,households. The tomahawk and scalping-knife were sometimes secretly
5998,BOSTON,"raised, so that when they returned home, there was no wife or children"
5999,BOSTON,"there, only dead bodies. A savage foe had chosen this terrible form of"
6000,BOSTON,"vengeance, for real or supposed wrongs."
6001,BOSTON,
6002,BOSTON,"If true glory belongs to those who do great good to mankind, is not the"
6003,BOSTON,glory of the warrior a false glory? Does not History sometimes confer on
6004,BOSTON,"her heroes, a fame which religion condemns? But we ask how are wars to"

6011,BOSTON,"beginning, is this any reason why there should be unto the end? Do not"
6012,BOSTON,"the Scriptures of Truth foretell a happy period on earth, when there"
6013,BOSTON,shall be war no more? How beautifully has a poet versified the cheering
6014,BOSTON,prediction:

6016,BOSTON,"""No more shall nation against nation rise,"
6017,BOSTON,"Nor ardent warriors meet, with hateful eyes,"

6033,BOSTON,
6034,BOSTON,"Avoid contention with your companions. Use no offensive words, and when"

6037,BOSTON,"to set them a better example. If any speak unfavourably of you, it is"

6139,BOSTON,
6140,BOSTON,"In the corner, which they used to occupy, their eldest son, and his"

6175,BOSTON,"""I have endured hunger, and thirst, and imprisonment, and the misery of"
6176,BOSTON,"sickness in an enemy's land; and then the image of my home, and my"
6177,BOSTON,"disobedience and ingratitude, were with me when I lay down, and when I"
6178,BOSTON,"rose up, and when I was sleepless and sick in the neglected hospitals."
6179,BOSTON,
6180,BOSTON,"""In broken visions, I would see my dear mother bending tenderly over me,"
6181,BOSTON,"as she used to do, when I had only a headache; and my father with the"
6182,BOSTON,"great Bible in his hand, reading as he used to do before prayer; but"
6183,BOSTON,"when I cried out in agony. 'I am no more worthy to be called thy son,'"
6184,BOSTON,"I awoke, and it was all a dream."""
6185,BOSTON,
6186,BOSTON,"His brother assured him of the perfect forgivenness of his parents, and"
6187,BOSTON,"that duly, at morn and eve, he was borne upon their supplications at the"
6188,BOSTON,"family altar, as the son, erring, yet beloved. ""Ah, yes, and those"
6189,BOSTON,"prayers followed me. But for them I should have been a reprobate,"
6190,BOSTON,"forsaken both of God and man."""
6191,BOSTON,
6192,BOSTON,"As strength permitted, he told them the story of his wanderings. He had"
6193,BOSTON,"been in battles, on land and sea. He had heard the deep ocean echo to"
6194,BOSTON,"the cannon's thunder, and seen earth drink the red shower from the"
6195,BOSTON,bosoms of her slaughtered sons.
6196,BOSTON,
6197,BOSTON,"He had stood in the martial lists of Europe, and hazarded his life for a"
6198,BOSTON,"foreign power, and had pursued, in his native land, the hunted Indian,"
6199,BOSTON,flying at midnight from the flames of his own hut. He had ventured with
6200,BOSTON,"the bravest, into the deepest danger, seeking every where for the glory"
6201,BOSTON,"which had dazzled his boyhood, but in vain."
6202,BOSTON,
6203,BOSTON,"He found that it was the lot of the soldier to endure hardship, that"
6204,BOSTON,"others might reap the fame. He saw what fractures and mutilations, what"
6205,BOSTON,"misery, and mourning, and death, were necessary to purchase the reward"
6206,BOSTON,"of victory. He felt how light was even the renown of the conqueror,"
6207,BOSTON,"compared with the good that he forfeits, and the sorrow that he inflicts"
6208,BOSTON,to obtain it.
6209,BOSTON,
6210,BOSTON,"""Sometimes,"" he said, ""just before rushing into battle, I felt a"
6211,BOSTON,"shuddering, and inexpressible horror, at the thought of butchering my"
6212,BOSTON,"fellow-creatures. But in the heat of contest, all such sympathies"
6213,BOSTON,"vanished, and madness and desperation possessed me, so that I cared"
6214,BOSTON,neither for this life nor the next.
6215,BOSTON,
6216,BOSTON,"""I have been left wounded on the field, unable to move from among the"
6217,BOSTON,"feet of trampling horses, my open gashes stiffening in the chilly night"
6218,BOSTON,"air, and death staring me in the face, while no man cared for my soul."
6219,BOSTON,"Yet I will not distress your kind hearts, by describing my varieties of"
6220,BOSTON,pain.
6221,BOSTON,
6222,BOSTON,"""You, who have always lived amid the influences of mercy; who shrink to"
6223,BOSTON,"give unnecessary suffering, even to an animal, cannot realize what"
6224,BOSTON,"hardness of heart, comes with the life of a soldier, familiar as he must"
6225,BOSTON,"be with groans, and violence, and cruelty."
6226,BOSTON,
6227,BOSTON,"""His moral and religious feelings, are in still greater danger. Oaths,"
6228,BOSTON,"imprecations, and contempt of sacred things, are mingled with the"
6229,BOSTON,"elements of his trade. The sweet and holy influences of the Sabbath, and"
6230,BOSTON,"the precepts of the Gospel, impressed upon his childhood, are too often"
6231,BOSTON,swept away.
6232,BOSTON,
6233,BOSTON,"""Yet though I exerted myself to appear bold and courageous, and even"
6234,BOSTON,"hardened, my heart reproached me. Oh, that it might be purified by"
6235,BOSTON,"repentance, and at peace with God, before I am summoned to the dread bar"
6236,BOSTON,"of judgment, to answer for my deeds of blood."""
6237,BOSTON,
6238,BOSTON,"His friends flattered themselves, that, by medical skill, and careful"
6239,BOSTON,"nursing, he might be restored to health. But he answered, ""No, it can"
6240,BOSTON,"never be. My vital energies are wasted. Even now, is Death standing at"
6241,BOSTON,"my right hand."""
6242,BOSTON,
6243,BOSTON,"""When I entered this peaceful valley, my swollen limbs tottered, and"
6244,BOSTON,"began to fail. Then I prayed to the Almighty, whom I had so often"
6245,BOSTON,"forgotten, 'Oh, give me strength but a little longer, that I may reach"
6246,BOSTON,"the home where I was born, and die there, and be buried by the side of"
6247,BOSTON,"my father and my mother.'"""
6248,BOSTON,
6249,BOSTON,"The sick and penitent soldier, sought earnestly for the hope of"
6250,BOSTON,"salvation. He felt that a great change was needed in his soul, ere it"
6251,BOSTON,could be fitted for the holy employments of a realm of purity and
6252,BOSTON,"peace. He prayed, and wept, and studied the Scriptures, and listened to"
6253,BOSTON,the counsel of pious men.
6254,BOSTON,
6255,BOSTON,"""Brother, dear brother,"" he would say, ""you have obeyed the precepts of"
6256,BOSTON,our parents. You have chosen the path of peace. You have been merciful
6257,BOSTON,"even to the inferior creatures. You have shorn the fleece, but not"
6258,BOSTON,"wantonly destroyed the lamb. You have taken the honey, and spared the"
6259,BOSTON,labouring bee.
6260,BOSTON,
6261,BOSTON,"""But I have destroyed man, and his habitation; the hive and the honey;"
6262,BOSTON,"the fleece and the flock. I have defaced the image of God, and crushed"
6263,BOSTON,"out that breath, which I can never restore. You know not how bitter is"
6264,BOSTON,"the warfare of my soul with the 'Prince of the power of the air, the"
6265,BOSTON,"spirit that ruleth in the children of disobedience.'"""
6266,BOSTON,
6267,BOSTON,"As the last hour approached, he laid his cold hand on the head of his"
6268,BOSTON,"brother's eldest child, who had been named for him, and said faintly,"
6269,BOSTON,"""Little James, obey your parents, and never be a soldier. Sister,"
6270,BOSTON,"brother, you have been angels of mercy to me. The blessing of God be"
6271,BOSTON,"upon you, and your household."""
6272,BOSTON,
6273,BOSTON,"The venerable minister who instructed his childhood, and laid his"
6274,BOSTON,"parents in the grave, had daily visited him in his sickness. He stood by"
6275,BOSTON,"his side, as he went down into the valley of the shadow of death. ""My"
6276,BOSTON,"son, look unto the Lamb of God."" ""Yes, father, there is a fullness in"
6277,BOSTON,"Him for the chief of sinners."""
6278,BOSTON,
6279,BOSTON,The aged man lifted up his fervent prayer for the departing soul. He
6280,BOSTON,commended it to the boundless compassions of Him who receiveth the
6281,BOSTON,"penitent; and besought for it, a gentle passage to that world, where"
6282,BOSTON,"there is no more sin, neither sorrow, nor crying."
6283,BOSTON,
6284,BOSTON,He ceased. The eyes of the dying were closed. There was no more heaving
6285,BOSTON,"of the breast, or gasping. They thought the breath had quitted the clay."
6286,BOSTON,They spoke of him as having passed where all tears are wiped from the
6287,BOSTON,eyes for ever.
6288,BOSTON,
6289,BOSTON,But again there was a faint sigh. The white lips slowly moved. His
6290,BOSTON,"brother bending over him caught the last, low whisper,--""Jesus! Saviour!"
6291,BOSTON,"take a repentant sinner to the world of peace."""
6292,BOSTON,
6293,BOSTON,
6294,BOSTON,
6295,BOSTON,
6296,BOSTON,The Indian King.
6297,BOSTON,
6298,BOSTON,
6299,BOSTON,"Among the early settlers of these United States, were some pious people,"
6300,BOSTON,"called Hugenots, who fled from the persecutions in France, under Louis"
6301,BOSTON,"the Fourteenth. It has been said, that wherever the elements of their"
6302,BOSTON,"character mingled with the New World, the infusion was salutary."
6303,BOSTON,
6304,BOSTON,"Industry, patience, sweet social affections, and piety, firm, but not"
6305,BOSTON,"austere, were the distinctive features of this interesting race. A"
6306,BOSTON,"considerable number of them, chose their abode in a part of the State of"
6307,BOSTON,"Massachusetts, about the year 1686, and commenced the labours"
6308,BOSTON,inseparable from the formation of a new colony.
6309,BOSTON,
6310,BOSTON,"In their vicinity, was a powerful tribe of Indians, whom they strove to"
6311,BOSTON,"conciliate. They extended to them the simple rites of hospitality, and"
6312,BOSTON,"their kind and gentle manners, wrought happily upon the proud, yet"
6313,BOSTON,susceptible nature of the aborigines.
6314,BOSTON,
6315,BOSTON,But their settlement had not long assumed the marks of regularity and
6316,BOSTON,"beauty, ere they observed in their savage neighbours, a reserved"
6317,BOSTON,"deportment. This increased, until the son of the forest, utterly avoided"
6318,BOSTON,"the dwellings of the new comers, where he had been pleased to accept a"
6319,BOSTON,"shelter for the night, or a covert for the storm."
6320,BOSTON,
6321,BOSTON,"Occasionally, some lingering one might be seen near the cultivated"
6322,BOSTON,"grounds, regarding the more skilful agriculture of the white"
6323,BOSTON,inhabitants with a dejected and lowering brow. It was rumoured that
6324,BOSTON,these symptoms of disaffection arose from the influence of an aged
6325,BOSTON,"chief, whom they considered a prophet, who denounced the ""pale"
6326,BOSTON,"intruders;"" and they grieved that they should not have been more"
6327,BOSTON,successful in conciliating their red brethren.
6328,BOSTON,
6329,BOSTON,Three years had elapsed since the establishment of their little colony.
6330,BOSTON,"Autumn was now advancing towards its close, and copse and forest"
6331,BOSTON,"exhibited those varied and opposing hues, which clothe in beauty and"
6332,BOSTON,"brilliance, the foliage of New England. The harvest was gathered in, and"
6333,BOSTON,every family made preparation for the approach of winter.
6334,BOSTON,
6335,BOSTON,"Here and there groups of children might be seen, bearing homeward"
6336,BOSTON,"baskets of nuts, which they had gathered in the thicket, or forest. It"
6337,BOSTON,"was pleasant to hear their joyous voices, and see their ruddy faces,"
6338,BOSTON,"like bright flowers, amid wilds so lately tenanted by the prowling wolf,"
6339,BOSTON,"the fierce panther, and the sable bear."
6340,BOSTON,
6341,BOSTON,"In one of these nut-gatherings, a little boy and girl, of eight and four"
6342,BOSTON,"years old, the only children of a settler, whose wife had died on the"
6343,BOSTON,"voyage hither, accidentally separated from their companions. They had"
6344,BOSTON,"discovered on their way home, profuse clusters of the purple"
6345,BOSTON,"frost-grape, and entering a rocky recess to gain the new treasure, did"
6346,BOSTON,not perceive that the last rays of the setting sun were fading away.
6347,BOSTON,
6348,BOSTON,"Suddenly they were seized by two Indians. The boy struggled violently,"
6349,BOSTON,"and his little sister cried to him for protection, but in vain. The long"
6350,BOSTON,"strides of their captors, soon bore them far beyond the bounds of the"
6351,BOSTON,"settlement. Night was far advanced, ere they halted. Then they kindled a"
6352,BOSTON,"fire, and offered the children some food."
6353,BOSTON,
6354,BOSTON,"The heart of the boy swelled high with grief and anger, and he refused"
6355,BOSTON,to partake. But the poor little girl took some parched corn from the
6356,BOSTON,"hand of the Indian, who held her on his knee. He smiled as he saw her"
6357,BOSTON,"eat the kernels, and look up in his face with a wondering, yet"
6358,BOSTON,"reproachless eye. Then they lay down to sleep, in the dark forest, each"
6359,BOSTON,with an arm over his captive.
6360,BOSTON,
6361,BOSTON,"Great was the alarm in the colony, when those children returned not."
6362,BOSTON,"Every spot was searched, where it was thought possible they might have"
6363,BOSTON,"lost their way. But, when at length their little baskets were found,"
6364,BOSTON,"overturned in a tangled thicket, one terrible conclusion burst upon"
6365,BOSTON,"every mind, that they must have been captured by Indians."
6366,BOSTON,
6367,BOSTON,"It was decided, that ere any warlike measures were adopted, the father"
6368,BOSTON,"should go peacefully to the Indian king, and demand his children. At the"
6369,BOSTON,"earliest dawn of morning, he departed with his companions. They met a"
6370,BOSTON,"friendly Indian, pursuing the chase, who had occasionally shared their"
6371,BOSTON,hospitality and consented to be their guide.
6372,BOSTON,
6373,BOSTON,"They travelled through rude paths, until the day drew near a close."
6374,BOSTON,"Then, approaching a circle of native dwellings, in the midst of which"
6375,BOSTON,"was a tent, they saw a man of lofty form, with a cornet of feathers upon"
6376,BOSTON,"his brow, and surrounded by warriors. The guide saluted him as his"
6377,BOSTON,"monarch, and the bereaved father, bowing down, addressed him:"
6378,BOSTON,
6379,BOSTON,"""King of the red men, thou seest a father in pursuit of his lost babes."
6380,BOSTON,He has heard that your people will not harm the stranger in distress. So
6381,BOSTON,"he trusts himself fearlessly among you. The king of our own native land,"
6382,BOSTON,"who should have protected us, became our foe. We fled from our dear"
6383,BOSTON,"homes, from the graves of our fathers."
6384,BOSTON,
6385,BOSTON,"""The ocean-wave brought us to this New World. We are a peaceful race,"
6386,BOSTON,pure from the blood of all men. We seek to take the hand of our red
6387,BOSTON,"brethren. Of my own kindred, none inhabit this wilderness save two"
6388,BOSTON,"little buds from a broken, buried stem."
6389,BOSTON,
6390,BOSTON,"""Last night, sorrow entered into my soul, because I found them not."
6391,BOSTON,"Knowest thou, O king, if thy people have taken my babes? Knowest thou"
6392,BOSTON,"where they have concealed them? Cause them, I pray thee, to be restored"
6393,BOSTON,"to my arms. So shall the Great Spirit bless thine own tender plants, and"
6394,BOSTON,"lift up thy heart when it weigheth heavily in thy bosom."""
6395,BOSTON,
6396,BOSTON,"The Indian monarch, bending on him a piercing glance, said, ""Knowest"
6397,BOSTON,thou me? Look in my eyes! Look! Answer me! Are they those of a
6398,BOSTON,"stranger?"" The Hugenot replied that he had no recollection of having"
6399,BOSTON,ever before seen his countenance.
6400,BOSTON,
6401,BOSTON,"""Thus it is with the white man. He is dim-eyed. He looketh on the"
6402,BOSTON,"garments, more than on the soul. Where your ploughs wound the earth, oft"
6403,BOSTON,"have I stood, watching your toil. There was no coronet on my brow. But I"
6404,BOSTON,was a king. And you knew it not.
6405,BOSTON,
6406,BOSTON,"""I looked upon your people. I saw neither pride nor violence. I went an"
6407,BOSTON,"enemy, but returned a friend. I said to my warriors, do these men no"
6408,BOSTON,harm. They do not hate Indians. Then our white-haired Prophet of the
6409,BOSTON,"Great Spirit rebuked me. He bade me make no league with the pale faces,"
6410,BOSTON,lest angry words should be spoken of me among the shades of our buried
6411,BOSTON,kings.
6412,BOSTON,
6413,BOSTON,"""Yet again I went where thy brethren have reared their dwellings. Yes, I"
6414,BOSTON,entered thy house. _And thou knowest not this brow!_ I could tell thine
6415,BOSTON,"at midnight, if but a single star trembled through the clouds. My ear"
6416,BOSTON,"would know thy voice, though the storm were abroad with all its"
6417,BOSTON,thunders.
6418,BOSTON,
6419,BOSTON,"""I have said that I was a king. Yet I came to thee an hungered. And thou"
6420,BOSTON,gavest me bread. My head was wet with the tempest. Thou badest me to lie
6421,BOSTON,"down on thy hearth, and thy son for whom thou mournest, covered me."
6422,BOSTON,
6423,BOSTON,"""I was sad in spirit. And thy little daughter whom thou seekest with"
6424,BOSTON,"tears, sat on my knee. She smiled when I told her how the beaver"
6425,BOSTON,"buildeth his house in the forest. My heart was comforted, for I saw that"
6426,BOSTON,she did not hate Indians.
6427,BOSTON,
6428,BOSTON,"""Turn not on me such a terrible eye. I am no stealer of babes. I have"
6429,BOSTON,reproved the people who took the children. I have sheltered them for
6430,BOSTON,thee. Not a hair of their heads is hurt. Thinkest thou that the red man
6431,BOSTON,can forget kindness? They are sleeping in my tent. Had I but a single
6432,BOSTON,"blanket, it should have been their bed. Take them, and return unto thy"
6433,BOSTON,"people."""
6434,BOSTON,
6435,BOSTON,"He waved his hand to an attendant, and in a moment the two children were"
6436,BOSTON,in the arms of their father. The white men were hospitably sheltered for
6437,BOSTON,"that night, and the twilight of the next day, bore upward from the"
6438,BOSTON,"rejoicing colony, a prayer for the heathen of the forest, and that pure"
6439,BOSTON,praise which mingles with the music around the throne.

6455,BOSTON,Wild warfare he maintained.
6456,BOSTON,
6457,BOSTON,"From hamlet-nook, and humble vale,"
6458,BOSTON,"Their wealth he reft away,"
6459,BOSTON,"And shamed not with his blood-red steel,"
6460,BOSTON,To wake the deadly fray.
6461,BOSTON,
6462,BOSTON,"But once within an islet's bay,"
6463,BOSTON,While summer-twilight spread
6464,BOSTON,"A curtain o'er the glorious sun,"
6465,BOSTON,"Who sank to ocean's bed,"
6466,BOSTON,
6467,BOSTON,"He paus'd amid his savage trade,"
6468,BOSTON,"And gaz'd on earth and sea,"
6469,BOSTON,"While o'er his head a nest of doves,"
6470,BOSTON,Hung in a linden tree.
6471,BOSTON,
6472,BOSTON,"They coo'd and murmur'd o'er their young,"
6473,BOSTON,"A loving, mournful strain."
6474,BOSTON,"And still the chirping brood essay'd,"
6475,BOSTON,The same soft tones again.
6476,BOSTON,
6477,BOSTON,The sea-king on the rocky beach;
6478,BOSTON,"Bow'd down his head to hear,"
6479,BOSTON,"Yet started on his iron brow,"
6480,BOSTON,To feel a trickling tear.
6481,BOSTON,
6482,BOSTON,"He mus'd upon his lonely home,"
6483,BOSTON,Beyond the foaming main;
6484,BOSTON,"For nature kindled in his breast,"
6485,BOSTON,At that fond dovelet's strain.
6486,BOSTON,
6487,BOSTON,"He listen'd till the lay declin'd,"
6488,BOSTON,As slumber o'er them stole:
6489,BOSTON,"""_Home, home, sweet home!_"" methought they sang;"
6490,BOSTON,It enter'd to his soul.
6491,BOSTON,
6492,BOSTON,"He linger'd till the moon came forth,"
6493,BOSTON,"With radiance pure and pale,"
6494,BOSTON,"And then his hardy crew he rous'd,"
6495,BOSTON,"""Up! up! and spread the sail."""
6496,BOSTON,
6497,BOSTON,"""Now, whither goest thou, master bold?"""
6498,BOSTON,"No word the sea-king spake,"
6499,BOSTON,"But at the helm all night he stood,"
6500,BOSTON,Till ruddy morn did break.
6501,BOSTON,
6502,BOSTON,"""See, captain, yon unguarded isle!"
6503,BOSTON,"Those cattle are our prey;"""
6504,BOSTON,"Dark grew their brows, and fierce their speech:"
6505,BOSTON,No word he deign'd to say.
6506,BOSTON,
6507,BOSTON,"Right onward, o'er the swelling wave,"
6508,BOSTON,"With steady prow he bore,"
6509,BOSTON,"Nor stay'd until he anchor'd fast,"
6510,BOSTON,By Denmark's wave-wash'd shore.
6511,BOSTON,
6512,BOSTON,"""Farewell, farewell, brave men and true,"
6513,BOSTON,Well have you serv'd my need;
6514,BOSTON,"Divide the spoils as best ye may,"
6515,BOSTON,"Rich boon for daring deed."""
6516,BOSTON,
6517,BOSTON,"He shook them by the harden'd hand,"
6518,BOSTON,"And on his journey sped,"
6519,BOSTON,"Nor linger'd till through shades he saw,"
6520,BOSTON,His long-forsaken shed.
6521,BOSTON,
6522,BOSTON,"Forth came the babe, that when he left,"
6523,BOSTON,Lay on its mother's knee;
6524,BOSTON,She rais'd a stranger's wondering cry:
6525,BOSTON,A fair-hair'd girl was she!
6526,BOSTON,
6527,BOSTON,"His far-off voice that mother knew,"
6528,BOSTON,"And shriek'd in speechless joy,"

6531,BOSTON,
6532,BOSTON,"They bade the fire of pine burn bright,"

6536,BOSTON,
6537,BOSTON,"He cleans'd him of the pirate's sin,"
6538,BOSTON,"He donn'd the peasant's stole,"

6540,BOSTON,With music in his soul.
6541,BOSTON,
6542,BOSTON,"""Father! what mean those words you speak"

6581,BOSTON,"And the heart's gush of sorrow, how hopeless and sore,"
6582,BOSTON,In those homes that the lov'd ones revisit no more.
6583,BOSTON,
6584,BOSTON,"I have trac'd out thy march, by its features of pain,"
6585,BOSTON,"While famine and pestilence stalk'd in thy train,"
6586,BOSTON,"And the trophies of sin did thy victory swell,"

6601,BOSTON,Early Recollections.
6602,BOSTON,
6603,BOSTON,
6604,BOSTON,The years of my childhood passed away in contentment and peace. My lot
6605,BOSTON,"was in humble and simple industry; yet my heart was full of gladness,"
6606,BOSTON,though I scarcely knew why. I loved to sit under the shadow of the
6607,BOSTON,"rugged rocks, and to hear the murmured song of the falling brook."
6608,BOSTON,
6609,BOSTON,"I made to myself a companionship among the things of nature, and was"
6610,BOSTON,"happy all the day. But when evening darkened the landscape, I sat down"
6611,BOSTON,"pensively; for I was alone, and had neither brother nor sister."
6612,BOSTON,
6613,BOSTON,"I was ever wishing for a brother who should be older than myself, into"
6614,BOSTON,"whose hand I might put my own, and say, ""Lead me forth to look at the"
6615,BOSTON,"solemn stars, and tell me of their names."" Sometimes, too, I wept in my"
6616,BOSTON,"bed, because there was no sister to lay her head upon the same pillow."
6617,BOSTON,
6618,BOSTON,"At twilight, before the lamps were lighted, there came up out of my"
6619,BOSTON,"bosom, what seemed to be a friend. I did not then understand that its"
6620,BOSTON,"name was Thought. But I talked with it, and it comforted me. I waited"
6621,BOSTON,"for its coming, and whatsoever it asked of me, I answered."
6622,BOSTON,
6623,BOSTON,"When it questioned me of my knowledge, I said, ""I know where the first"
6624,BOSTON,"fresh violets of spring grow, and where the lily of the vale hides in"
6625,BOSTON,"its broad green sheath, and where the vine climbs to hang its purple"
6626,BOSTON,"clusters, and where the forest nuts ripen, when autumn comes with its"
6627,BOSTON,sparkling frost.
6628,BOSTON,
6629,BOSTON,"""I have seen how the bee nourishes itself in winter with the essence of"
6630,BOSTON,"flowers, which its own industry embalmed; and I have learned to draw"
6631,BOSTON,"forth the kindness of domestic animals, and to tell the names of the"
6632,BOSTON,"birds which build dwellings in my father's trees."""
6633,BOSTON,
6634,BOSTON,"Then Thought enquired, ""What knowest thou of those who reason, and to"
6635,BOSTON,"whom God has given dominion over the beasts of the field, and over the"
6636,BOSTON,"fowls of the air?"" I confessed, that of my own race I knew nothing, save"
6637,BOSTON,"of the parents who nurtured me, and the few children with whom I had"
6638,BOSTON,played on the summer turf.
6639,BOSTON,
6640,BOSTON,"I was ashamed, for I felt that I was ignorant. So I determined to turn"
6641,BOSTON,"away from the wild herbs of the field, and the old trees where I had"
6642,BOSTON,"helped the gray squirrel to gather acorns, and to look attentively upon"
6643,BOSTON,what passed among men.
6644,BOSTON,
6645,BOSTON,"I walked abroad when the morning dews were lingering upon the grass, and"
6646,BOSTON,"the white lilies drooping their beautiful heads to shed tears of joy,"
6647,BOSTON,"and the young rose blushing, as if it listened to its own praise. Nature"
6648,BOSTON,"smiled upon those sweet children, that were so soon to fade."
6649,BOSTON,
6650,BOSTON,"But I turned toward those whose souls have the gift of reason, and are"
6651,BOSTON,"not born to die. I said, ""If there is joy in the plant that flourishes"
6652,BOSTON,"for a day, and in the bird bearing to its nest but a broken cherry, and"
6653,BOSTON,"in the lamb that has no friend but its mother, how much happier must"
6654,BOSTON,"they be, who are surrounded with good things, as by a flowing river, and"
6655,BOSTON,"who know that, though they seem to die, it is but to live for ever."""
6656,BOSTON,
6657,BOSTON,"I looked upon a group of children. They were untaught and unfed, and"
6658,BOSTON,clamoured loudly with wayward tongues. I asked them why they walked not
6659,BOSTON,in the pleasant paths of knowledge. And they mocked at me. I heard two
6660,BOSTON,"who were called friends, speak harsh words to each other, and was"
6661,BOSTON,affrighted at the blows they dealt.
6662,BOSTON,
6663,BOSTON,"I saw a man with a fiery and a bloated face. He was built strongly, like"
6664,BOSTON,the oak among trees; yet his steps were weak and unsteady as those of
6665,BOSTON,"the tottering babe. He fell heavily, and lay as one dead. I marvelled"
6666,BOSTON,that no hand was stretched out to raise him up.
6667,BOSTON,
6668,BOSTON,"I saw an open grave. A widow stood near it, with her little ones. They"
6669,BOSTON,"looked downcast, and sad at heart. Yet, methought it was famine and"
6670,BOSTON,"misery, more than sorrow for the dead, which had set on them such a"
6671,BOSTON,yellow and shrivelled seal.
6672,BOSTON,
6673,BOSTON,"I said, ""What can have made the parents not pity their children when"
6674,BOSTON,"they hungered, nor call them home when they were in wickedness? What"
6675,BOSTON,"made the friends forget their early love, and the strong man fall down"
6676,BOSTON,"senseless, and the young die before his time?"" I heard a voice say,"
6677,BOSTON,"""Intemperance. And there is mourning in the land, because of this."""
6678,BOSTON,
6679,BOSTON,"So I returned to my home, sorrowing; and had God given me a brother or a"
6680,BOSTON,"sister, I would have thrown my arms around their neck, and entreated,"
6681,BOSTON,"""Touch not your lips to the poison cup, and let us drink the pure water"
6682,BOSTON,"which God hath blessed, all the days of our lives."""
6683,BOSTON,
6684,BOSTON,"Again I went forth. I met a beautiful boy weeping, and I asked him why"
6685,BOSTON,"he wept. He answered, ""Because my father went to the wars and is slain;"
6686,BOSTON,"he will return no more."" I saw a mournful woman. The sun shone upon her"
6687,BOSTON,"dwelling. The honeysuckle climbed to its windows, and sent in its sweet"
6688,BOSTON,blossoms to do their loving message. But she was a widow. Her husband
6689,BOSTON,had fallen in battle. There was joy for her no more.
6690,BOSTON,
6691,BOSTON,"I saw a hoary man, sitting by the wayside. Grief had made furrows upon"
6692,BOSTON,"his forehead, and his garments were thin and tattered. Yet he asked not"
6693,BOSTON,"for charity. And when I besought him to tell me why his heart was heavy,"
6694,BOSTON,"he replied faintly, ""I had a son, an only one. From his cradle, I"
6695,BOSTON,"toiled, that he might have food and clothing, and be taught wisdom."
6696,BOSTON,
6697,BOSTON,"""He grew up to bless me. So all my labour and weariness were forgotten."
6698,BOSTON,"When he became a man, I knew no want; for he cherished me, as I had"
6699,BOSTON,cherished him. Yet he left me to be a soldier. He was slaughtered in the
6700,BOSTON,"field of battle. Therefore mine eye runneth down with water, because the"
6701,BOSTON,"comforter that should relieve my soul returns no more."""
6702,BOSTON,
6703,BOSTON,"I said, ""Show me, I pray thee, a field of battle, that I may know what"
6704,BOSTON,"war means."" But he answered, ""Thou art not able to bear the sight."""
6705,BOSTON,"""Tell me, then,"" I entreated, ""what thou hast seen, when the battle was"
6706,BOSTON,"done."""
6707,BOSTON,
6708,BOSTON,"""I came,"" he said, ""at the close of day, when the cannon ceased their"
6709,BOSTON,"thunder, and the victor and vanquished had withdrawn. The rising moon"
6710,BOSTON,looked down on the pale faces of the dead. Scattered over the broad
6711,BOSTON,plain were many who still struggled with the pangs of death.
6712,BOSTON,
6713,BOSTON,"""They stretched out the shattered limb, yet there was no healing hand."
6714,BOSTON,"They strove to raise their heads, but sank deeper in the blood which"
6715,BOSTON,flowed from their own bosoms. They begged in God's name that we would
6716,BOSTON,"put them out of their misery, and their piercing shrieks entered into my"
6717,BOSTON,soul.
6718,BOSTON,
6719,BOSTON,"""Here and there horses, mad with pain, rolled and plunged, mangling with"
6720,BOSTON,"their hoofs the dying, or defacing the dead. And I remember the mourning"
6721,BOSTON,"for those who lay there; of the parents who had reared them, or of the"
6722,BOSTON,"young children who used to sit at home upon their knee."""
6723,BOSTON,
6724,BOSTON,"Then I said, ""Tell me no more of battle or of war, for my heart is sad."""
6725,BOSTON,"The silver-haired man raised his eyes upward, and I kneeled down by his"
6726,BOSTON,side.
6727,BOSTON,
6728,BOSTON,"And he prayed, ""Lord, keep this child from anger, and hatred, and"
6729,BOSTON,"ambition, which are the seeds of war. Grant to all that own the name of"
6730,BOSTON,"Jesus, hearts of peace, that they may shun every deed of strife, and"
6731,BOSTON,"dwell at last in the country of peace, even in heaven."""
6732,BOSTON,
6733,BOSTON,"Hastening home, I besought my mother, ""Shelter me, as I have been"
6734,BOSTON,"sheltered, in solitude, and in love. Bid me turn the wheel of industry,"
6735,BOSTON,"or bring water from the fountain, or tend the plants of the garden, or"
6736,BOSTON,"feed a young bird and listen to its song, but let me go no more forth"
6737,BOSTON,"among the vices and miseries of man."""
