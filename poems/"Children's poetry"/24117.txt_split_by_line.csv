155,PARTY.,
156,PARTY.,[Illustration: Mr. Velvet-Purr and other visitors arrive at Miss
157,PARTY.,Tabitha's.]
158,PARTY.,
159,PARTY.,"Miss Tabitha Pussycat was a quiet, sleek, old creature, and was so prim,"
160,PARTY.,that her friends called her an old maid; and some of them even said that
161,PARTY.,"she was an old cat, but they were the people who were not asked to her"
162,PARTY.,"nice tea parties. When she gave a tea party, she sent her page Jacko to"
163,PARTY.,"invite her friends. Jacko was a clever monkey, who had come from his"
164,PARTY.,"last place at the Zoological Gardens, where he had been used to see a"
165,PARTY.,great deal of company.
166,PARTY.,
167,PARTY.,"One day Miss Tabitha made up her mind to have a larger party than usual,"
168,PARTY.,"so she sent out for a dish of pink shrimps, a bag of muffins, a"
169,PARTY.,"tea-cake, a new French loaf, and a pound of fresh butter. Then she sent"
170,PARTY.,Jacko out in his new coat to invite her friends.
171,PARTY.,
172,PARTY.,"First, there was Mr. Velvet Purr, a quiet old bachelor, who sat nearly"
173,PARTY.,"all day in the sun on a garden seat watching the birds, but who was much"
174,PARTY.,"too well fed to catch mice. Miss Velveteen Purr, his sister, went with"
175,PARTY.,"him, she was a very pretty singer, wore a fur tippet, and drank a good"
176,PARTY.,deal of milk to soften her voice.
177,PARTY.,
178,PARTY.,Sir Claude Scratch was a very different person. He was proud of his
179,PARTY.,"high family, for his father was second cousin to Dick Whittington's Cat,"
180,PARTY.,and had seen a great deal of the world. Sir Claude was very proud of his
181,PARTY.,"whiskers, and before he went to the tea party, he called on Frizzle"
182,PARTY.,"Frog, the barber, to be shaved. While he sat there, with the towel under"
183,PARTY.,"his chin, who should look in, but his friend Captain Black, a very"
184,PARTY.,"fierce looking fellow, who had killed hundreds of rats, and was always"
185,PARTY.,"ready to fight. He was a great favourite of the ladies, and said he"
186,PARTY.,would go to tea though he had not been invited.
187,PARTY.,
188,PARTY.,"[Illustration: Sir Claude Scratch calls on Frizzle Frog the barber, and"
189,PARTY.,"while he is being shaved, Captain Black drops in.]"
190,PARTY.,
191,PARTY.,The four Misses White were already on their way to Miss Pussycat's house
192,PARTY.,"in their clean stockings, and the nice silky dresses that their mother"
193,PARTY.,"had given them. Old Mrs. White lived at the baker's round the corner,"
194,PARTY.,"and her daughters' names were Fluffy, Tibby, Titty, and Tip; all of them"
195,PARTY.,famous for their beautiful skins and their bright eyes. You may be sure
196,PARTY.,"that the four Masters Tortoise Shell were waiting for them, for they had"
197,PARTY.,"been ready all the afternoon, with their tail-coats on, for the purpose"
198,PARTY.,of walking with these charming young ladies. They were very young
199,PARTY.,"gentlemen, so that they were quite proud at being asked."
200,PARTY.,
201,PARTY.,"It was a very grand tea table, and when all the party sat down it was"
202,PARTY.,"more than Jacko could do to wait upon them,--but the gentlemen handed"
203,PARTY.,"the tea to the ladies, and picked out the largest shrimps for the Misses"
204,PARTY.,"White, and nearly emptied the cream jug for Miss Velvet Purr, and helped"
205,PARTY.,"themselves to muffins, and were very merry indeed."
206,PARTY.,
207,PARTY.,Captain Black was so attentive that he would hand round the bread and
208,PARTY.,butter. He took the plate from under the very nose of Sir Claude
209,PARTY.,"Scratch, which made that person so angry, that nothing but a smile from"
210,PARTY.,Miss Tabitha would please him.
211,PARTY.,
212,PARTY.,"[Illustration: Miss Velvet-Purr sings a song, which is much admired.]"
213,PARTY.,
214,PARTY.,"After tea Miss Purr was asked to sing, and when she had taken another"
215,PARTY.,sip of milk she said she would give them an old song with variations.
216,PARTY.,"It was called Moll Rowdy, and the accompaniment was by Spitz, and"
217,PARTY.,everybody said that there never was anything more striking. Then Miss
218,PARTY.,"Tabitha, who had a very fine ear, gave them a little French song which"
219,PARTY.,"had a chorus of Tant Mieux, and they all joined in, Captain Black and"
220,PARTY.,Mr. Velvet Purr singing the bass. Then the Captain told a story of his
221,PARTY.,"travels to the Isle of Dogs, and Sir Claude related an adventure at St."
222,PARTY.,"Kitts, which set them all laughing."
223,PARTY.,
224,PARTY.,But the great fun of the evening was when the four Masters Tortoise
225,PARTY.,"Shell, whose names were Bobstay, Rattle, Clipper, and Dick, came into"
226,PARTY.,"the room with great white collars and black faces, and began to sing"
227,PARTY.,"like the Ethiopian Serenaders. Bobstay played the Fiddle, Rattle the"
228,PARTY.,"Bones, Clipper the Banjo, and Dick the Tambourine, when they sang ""Old"
229,PARTY.,"Dan Tucker,"" and ""Kafoozlum."" The four Misses White almost fell off"
230,PARTY.,"their seats with laughing, and Sir Claude was seen to put the tail of"
231,PARTY.,"his coat into his mouth; Captain Black didn't like it much, for he had a"
232,PARTY.,dark complexion and thought they were laughing at him.
233,PARTY.,
234,PARTY.,[Illustration: But the great fun of the evening was when the four
235,PARTY.,Masters Tortoise Shell appeared as Ethiopian Serenaders.]
236,PARTY.,
237,PARTY.,"At last it was time for them to be going, and Mr. Velvet Purr who was"
238,PARTY.,"very careful not to be out too late, brushed his coat in the hall, and"
239,PARTY.,said good night. Captain Black smoothed his fur jacket; Sir Claude
240,PARTY.,"Scratch stroked his whiskers, and the ladies began to arrange their"
241,PARTY.,dress for walking. Then there was such a fuss as they all said
242,PARTY.,"""Good-bye,"" that some of the neighbours looked out of window to see what"
243,PARTY.,was the matter; especially as Captain Black and Sir Claude quarrelled
244,PARTY.,"and fought in the street. At last, however, all the party got safely"
245,PARTY.,home.

439,THE THREE BEARS.,
440,THE THREE BEARS.,
441,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: The Three Bears take a walk.]
442,THE THREE BEARS.,
443,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: Little Silverlocks enters the Bears' dwelling.]
444,THE THREE BEARS.,
445,THE THREE BEARS.,"In a far-off country there was once a little girl, who was called"
446,THE THREE BEARS.,"Silver-Locks, because her curly hair shone so very brightly. But she was"
447,THE THREE BEARS.,"not so good as she was pretty, for she was a sad romp, and so restless"
448,THE THREE BEARS.,"that she could not be kept quiet at home, and would often run out when"
449,THE THREE BEARS.,"she was told not to do so. One day, she started off into a wood, to"
450,THE THREE BEARS.,"gather wild flowers and to chase butterflies. She ran here, and ran"
451,THE THREE BEARS.,"there, and went so far, at last, that she found herself in quite a"
452,THE THREE BEARS.,"lonely place, and there she saw a snug little house, in which three"
453,THE THREE BEARS.,Bears lived; but they were not then at home. The door and the parlour
454,THE THREE BEARS.,"window being open, Silver-Locks peeped in, and soon found the place was"
455,THE THREE BEARS.,"empty; so the saucy puss made up her mind to go in boldly, and look all"
456,THE THREE BEARS.,"about the place, little thinking what sort of folks lived there."
457,THE THREE BEARS.,
458,THE THREE BEARS.,"Now the three Bears had gone out to take a walk, a little while before"
459,THE THREE BEARS.,"this. The biggest of them was the Papa Bear, who had a very rough coat,"
460,THE THREE BEARS.,"and was named Mr. Bruin. The next Bear in size was his wife, called"
461,THE THREE BEARS.,"Mammy Muff, from her smooth skin; and the smallest of the three was"
462,THE THREE BEARS.,"their little darling, Tiny. Before going out, Mammy Muff put the nice"
463,THE THREE BEARS.,soup she had made for dinner on a great chest in the parlour to cool; as
464,THE THREE BEARS.,"they were very hungry, they meant to be back in a short time."
465,THE THREE BEARS.,
466,THE THREE BEARS.,"When Silverlocks went into the house, she soon found by the smell that"
467,THE THREE BEARS.,"something nice had been cooked. On going into the parlour, sure enough"
468,THE THREE BEARS.,"she saw there three jars smoking away: the first, a very large one, for"
469,THE THREE BEARS.,"Mr. Bruin; the next of middling size, for Mammy Muff; and the smallest"
470,THE THREE BEARS.,of all was Tiny's jar; and in each of them was a wooden spoon. The
471,THE THREE BEARS.,little busy-body now went to work tasting the soup in each jar by
472,THE THREE BEARS.,turns; but she found that in the smallest jar was the nicest to her
473,THE THREE BEARS.,taste.
474,THE THREE BEARS.,
475,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: Silverlocks finds three jars of soup set for the Bears'

477,THE THREE BEARS.,
478,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: Silverlocks tastes the soup and chooses the jar set for
479,THE THREE BEARS.,"Tiny, the little Bear.]"
480,THE THREE BEARS.,
481,THE THREE BEARS.,"Silver-Locks was now in high glee, and thought to enjoy herself, hungry"
482,THE THREE BEARS.,"as she was, by eating up all the soup in the little jar. But she was too"
483,THE THREE BEARS.,"weary to be standing all the time, so she looked about for a seat. There"
484,THE THREE BEARS.,"were three chairs in the parlour, a very large one for Mr. Bruin,"
485,THE THREE BEARS.,"another of middling size for Mrs. B., and a nice little chair for Tiny."
486,THE THREE BEARS.,The little girl tried them all in turn; she found that the smallest
487,THE THREE BEARS.,"suited her best, and down she sat, and began to eat her soup with great"
488,THE THREE BEARS.,relish.
489,THE THREE BEARS.,
490,THE THREE BEARS.,"When Silver-Locks had nearly eaten up all poor Tiny's soup, she began"
491,THE THREE BEARS.,to rock herself to and fro in his little chair: she had often been
492,THE THREE BEARS.,"punished for this naughty trick, but without effect. While she was"
493,THE THREE BEARS.,"indulging this silly whim, out came the rush-bottom of the chair, and"
494,THE THREE BEARS.,she and the soup jar rolled on the floor. But she did not mind this at
495,THE THREE BEARS.,"all, thinking it was fine fun. She now thought she would go up stairs,"
496,THE THREE BEARS.,and see all that was to be seen: and there we will leave her for the
497,THE THREE BEARS.,present.

503,THE THREE BEARS.,
504,THE THREE BEARS.,"When the three Bears came back, they found that some one had been there."
505,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Who has been to my soup?"" roared out Mr. Bruin. ""And who has been to my"
506,THE THREE BEARS.,"soup?"" said Mrs. B., with a low growl. Then poor Tiny cried,"
507,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Somebody has been to my soup, and has eaten it all up!"" Then said the"
508,THE THREE BEARS.,"big Bear, fiercely, ""Who has moved my chair about?"" Mrs. B., too, said,"
509,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Who has moved my chair about?"" Then Tiny cried pitifully, ""Somebody has"
510,THE THREE BEARS.,"sat in my chair, and broken it in pieces!"""
511,THE THREE BEARS.,
512,THE THREE BEARS.,In the room up stairs there were three beds: the largest was Mr. Bruin's
513,THE THREE BEARS.,bed; the next was Mrs. B.'s; and the smallest of the three was Tiny's
514,THE THREE BEARS.,"bed. Silver-Locks tried them all, but she found the little one the most"
515,THE THREE BEARS.,"comfortable; and as she was very sleepy, she crept into it, and fell"
516,THE THREE BEARS.,"fast asleep. The three Bears, thinking that somebody was in the house,"
517,THE THREE BEARS.,"came up stairs to look, and found their beds had been disturbed, and"
518,THE THREE BEARS.,"they all, in angry voices, asked who had dared to do it."

524,THE THREE BEARS.,
525,THE THREE BEARS.,"Silver-Locks did not hear the gruff voices of Mr. and Mrs. Bruin, but"
526,THE THREE BEARS.,the sharp squeak of Master Tiny's voice aroused her from her slumber.
527,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Somebody has disturbed my bed,"" cried he; and in a moment after he"
528,THE THREE BEARS.,"added, ""and here she is!"" looking at the same time as fierce as a little"
529,THE THREE BEARS.,Bear who had lost his dinner could do. The little girl was now almost
530,THE THREE BEARS.,"frightened to death, especially when she saw at the other end of the"
531,THE THREE BEARS.,"room two larger Bears, in a terrible rage. Luckily for her, there was an"
532,THE THREE BEARS.,"open window close to Tiny's bed, and seeing this, she jumped out of"
533,THE THREE BEARS.,"bed in a moment, and then took a spring, and escaped out of window,"
534,THE THREE BEARS.,falling on some soft grass below. The three Bears came to the open
535,THE THREE BEARS.,"window, and stared wildly at her, so she soon got up, and ran as fast as"
536,THE THREE BEARS.,"she could, until she got safe home again. Here she was properly punished"
537,THE THREE BEARS.,"for her wilful behaviour, besides the great fright she suffered from the"
538,THE THREE BEARS.,savage looks and angry growling of the THREE BEARS.

551,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
552,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Once upon a time a nice little girl lived in a country village, and she"
553,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,was the sweetest creature that ever was seen; her mother loved her with
554,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"great fondness, and her grandmother doted on her still more. A pretty"
555,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"red-coloured hood had been made for the little girl, which so much"
556,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"became her, that every one called her Little Red Riding-Hood. One"
557,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"day, her mother having made some cheesecakes, said to her: ""Go, my"
558,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"child, and see how your grandmother does, for I hear she is ill; carry"
559,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"her some of these cakes, and a little pot of butter."""
560,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
561,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Little Red Riding-Hood immediately set out, with a basket filled with"
562,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"the cakes and the pot of butter, for her grandmother's house, which was"
563,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,in a village a little distant from her mother's.
564,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
565,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"As she was crossing a wood, which lay in her road, she met a Gaffer"
566,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Wolf, who had a great mind to eat her up, but dared not indulge his"
567,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"wicked wish, because of some woodcutters who were at work near them in"
568,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"the forest. He ventured, however, to ask her whither she was going. The"
569,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"little girl, not knowing how dangerous it was to talk to a wolf,"
570,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"replied: ""I am going to see my grandmamma, and carry her these cakes and"
571,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"a pot of butter."""
572,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
573,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"""Does she live far off?"" said the Wolf. ""Oh, yes,"" answered Little Red"
574,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Riding-Hood, ""beyond the mill you see yonder, at the first house in the"
575,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"village."""

581,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
582,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"""Well,"" said the Wolf, ""I will go and see her too; I will take this"
583,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"way, and you take that, and let us see which will be there the sooner."""
584,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"The Wolf set out, running as fast as he could, and taking the nearest"
585,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"way; while the little girl took the longest, and amused herself as she"
586,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"went along with gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making"
587,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,nosegays of such flowers as she found within her reach. The Wolf soon
588,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"arrived at the dwelling of the grandmother, and knocked at the door."
589,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"""Who is there?"" said the old woman. ""It is your grandchild, Little Red"
590,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Riding-Hood,"" replied the Wolf, in the voice of the little girl; ""I"
591,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"have brought you some cheesecakes, and a little pot of butter, that"
592,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"mamma has sent you."""
593,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
594,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"The good old woman, who was ill in bed, then called out, ""Pull the"
595,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"bobbin, and the latch will go up."" The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the"
596,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"door opened. He sprang upon the poor old grandmother, and ate her up in"
597,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"a few minutes, for it was three days since he had tasted any food."
598,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
599,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,[Illustration: The Wolf attacks the poor Grandmother.]
600,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
601,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"The Wolf then shut the door, and laid himself down in the bed, and"
602,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"waited for Little Red Riding-Hood, who very soon after reached the"
603,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"door. Tap, tap! ""Who is there?"" She was at first a little frightened at"
604,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"the hoarse voice of the Wolf, but believing that her grandmother had got"
605,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"a cold she answered: ""It is your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood."
606,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Mamma has sent you some cheesecakes, and a little pot of butter."" The"
607,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Wolf called out, softening his voice: ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch"
608,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"will go up."" Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door"
609,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,opened.

611,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"[Illustration: The Wolf puts on the Grandmother's night-gown and cap,]"
612,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
613,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"When she came into the room, the Wolf, hiding himself under the"
614,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"bed-clothes, said to her, trying all he could to speak in a feeble"
615,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"voice, ""Put the basket, my child, on the stool, take off your clothes,"
616,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"and come into bed with me."""

621,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,
622,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Little Red Riding-Hood accordingly undressed herself, and stepped into"
623,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"bed; where, wondering to see how her grandmother looked in her"
624,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"nightclothes, she said to her: ""Grandmother, what great arms you have"
625,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"got!"" ""The better to hug thee, my child."" ""Grandmother, what great ears"
626,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"you have got!"" ""The better to hear thee, my child."" ""Grandmother,"
627,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"what great eyes, you have got!"" ""The better to see thee, my child."""
628,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"""Grandmother, what great teeth you have got!"" ""They are to eat thee up;"""
629,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,and saying these words the wicked Wolf fell upon poor Little Red
630,LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.,"Riding-Hood, and ate her up at a few mouthfuls."
