74,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,Elsie Dean was four years old when she was invited to her first party.
75,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"It was Dollie Blossom's fifth birthday, and Dollie's mamma had arranged"
76,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,for a little party in honor of the event. Of course Elsie's mamma was
77,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"perfectly willing she should go to the party, for the Blossoms were very"
78,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"nice people, and Mrs. Dean was always glad for an occasion of enjoyment"
79,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"for her little daughter. But alas, on the day before the party was to"
80,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"occur, Elsie went to a picnic, and was so unfortunate as to tear her"
81,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,dress--the only one she had which her mamma thought was suitable for her
82,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"to wear to the party. ""I am afraid you cannot go to the party, my dear,"
83,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"for now you have nothing fit to wear,"" said Mrs. Dean to Elsie. The"
84,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"little girl's eyes filled with tears, and her Grandmamma seemed to feel"
85,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,almost as bad about it as Elsie. But she did not wish to make the little
86,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"girl feel any worse over her disappointment, so she made light of it and"
87,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"told her that there would probably be another birthday party soon, and"
88,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,by that time she would surely have a suitable dress to wear. Elsie was
89,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"finally comforted, and went to bed in good spirits after kissing mamma"
90,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,and grandmamma good night.
91,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,
92,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"What was Elsie's surprise next morning, to find that her picnic dress"
93,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"had been mended ""good as new."" She did not need to ask who did it, for"
94,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"she felt certain that it was grandmamma's work, and so it proved."
95,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"Grandmamma remembered that she herself was a little girl once, and that"
96,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,blessed memory brought her into close sympathy with the grief and joy of
97,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"her little granddaughter. And so Elsie, thanks to her grandmamma's tact"
98,HOW GRANDMA SURPRISED ELSIE.,"and tenderness, went to Dolly Blossom's birthday party."

153,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,A lady who lived in New York City owned a pet parrot and a large house
154,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,cat. The parrot was just as full of mischief as could be. One day the
155,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,"cat and parrot had a quarrel. I think the cat had upset Polly's food, or"
156,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,"something of that kind. However, they seemed all right again. An hour or"
157,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,"so after Polly was on her stand, she called out in a tone of extreme"
158,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,"affection, ""Pussy! Pussy! come here, Pussy."" Pussy went and looked up"
159,THE CAT AND THE PARROT.,innocently enough; Polly with her beak seized her tin of food and tipped

294,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,
295,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,Tommy Green was a little boy only eight years old when his parents sent
296,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"him to ""boarding school,"" where he was thrown into the company of boys"
297,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,older than himself. It is strange how most all boys enjoy teasing those
298,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,who are younger than themselves.
299,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,
300,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"At Tommy's boarding school all the boys slept in one large room, on cots"
301,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,conveniently arranged. Tommy was a heavy sleeper. One morning he awoke
302,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"with a strange feeling of stiffness about his face, and no sooner did he"
303,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,sit up in bed than a laugh rang around the whole room.
304,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,
305,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"""What are you laughing at?"", he asked, but the boys only laughed the"
306,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,harder at his confusion. At last one little boy named Frankie Jones
307,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"cried out ""Tommy, it's your face."""
308,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,
309,TOMMY GREEN AND TOMMY RED.,"Tommy rushed to a looking-glass, and found on his forehead and on each"

329,FOND OF CATS.,"Pussy has always been a favorite in the East, but the country where she"
330,FOND OF CATS.,"was held in the highest estimation, and treated with the greatest"
331,FOND OF CATS.,"respect, was Egypt."
332,FOND OF CATS.,
333,FOND OF CATS.,The fondness of the Egyptians for their cats is shown in some of their
334,FOND OF CATS.,ancient paintings where the cat is frequently seen by the side of its
335,FOND OF CATS.,master whilst he entertains company. When a cat died the whole household
336,FOND OF CATS.,shaved off their eyebrows in token of mourning; and its body was sent to
337,FOND OF CATS.,"the embalmers, and there made into a mummy, and afterwards buried, with"
338,FOND OF CATS.,"great lamentations, in the cat-sepulchre adjoining the town."
339,FOND OF CATS.,
340,FOND OF CATS.,"Heredotus, the Greek historian, who had himself spent some time in"
341,FOND OF CATS.,"Egypt, and witnessed the customs of the natives, tells us that when a"
342,FOND OF CATS.,house caught fire the only care of the Egyptians was to save the lives
343,FOND OF CATS.,"of the cats, utterly regardless of the destruction of their property."
344,FOND OF CATS.,
345,FOND OF CATS.,"Bubastis was the sacred city of cats, and there was the temple of the"
346,FOND OF CATS.,"goddess Pasht, whose statue appeared with the head of a cat. There the"
347,FOND OF CATS.,"cats reveled in luxury, for they were looked upon as living"
348,FOND OF CATS.,representatives of the divinity. The punishment for killing any sacred
349,FOND OF CATS.,animal was death; but woe to the luckless person who even accidentally
350,FOND OF CATS.,"killed a cat? for he was set upon by the infuriated people, and torn to"
351,FOND OF CATS.,pieces without trial.
