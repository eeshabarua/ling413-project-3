42,,"To greet my fairest child,"
43,,I plucked them in my garden where

46,,"I cannot bring thee violets dear,"
47,,"Or cowslips growing wild,"
48,,"Or daisy chain for thee to wear,"
49,,"For thee to wear, my child."

51,,For all the grassy meadows near
52,,"Are clad with snow, my child;"
53,,Through all the days of winter drear
54,,No ray of sun has smiled.

56,,"I plucked this bunch of verses, dear,"
57,,"From out my garden wild,"
58,,I plucked them in the winter drear
59,,"For you, my fairest child,"
60,,"Your wet and wintry hours to cheer,"
61,,"They're Christmas Roses, child."
