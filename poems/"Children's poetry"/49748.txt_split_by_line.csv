410,TWO CALLS.,
411,TWO CALLS.,
412,TWO CALLS.,BEAU PHILIP and Beau Bobby stood side by side on the doorstep of their
413,TWO CALLS.,"father’s house. They were brothers, though you would hardly have"
414,TWO CALLS.,"thought it, for one was very big and one was very little."
415,TWO CALLS.,
416,TWO CALLS.,"Beau Philip was tall and slender, with handsome dark eyes, and a silky"
417,TWO CALLS.,brown moustache which he was fond of curling at the ends. He wore a
418,TWO CALLS.,"well-fitting overcoat, and a tall hat and pearl-gray kid gloves."
419,TWO CALLS.,
420,TWO CALLS.,"Beau Bobby was short and chubby, and ten years old, with blue eyes and"
421,TWO CALLS.,"yellow curls (not long ones, but funny little croppy locks that _would_"
422,TWO CALLS.,"curl, no matter how short he kept them). He wore a pea-jacket, and red"
423,TWO CALLS.,leggings and red mittens.
424,TWO CALLS.,
425,TWO CALLS.,"There was one thing, however, about the two brothers that was just the"
426,TWO CALLS.,"same. Each carried in his hand a great red rose, lovely and fragrant,"
427,TWO CALLS.,with crimson leaves and a golden heart.
428,TWO CALLS.,
429,TWO CALLS.,"“Where are you going with your rose, Beau Bobby?” asked Beau Philip."
430,TWO CALLS.,
431,TWO CALLS.,"“I am going to make a New Year’s call,” replied Beau Bobby."
432,TWO CALLS.,
433,TWO CALLS.,"“So am I,” said Beau Philip, laughing. “We may meet again. Good-by,"
434,TWO CALLS.,little Beau!”
435,TWO CALLS.,
436,TWO CALLS.,"“Good-by, big Beau!” said Bobby, seriously, and they walked off in"
437,TWO CALLS.,different directions.
438,TWO CALLS.,
439,TWO CALLS.,"Beau Philip went to call on a beautiful young lady, to whom he wished"
440,TWO CALLS.,to give his rose; but so many other people were calling on her at the
441,TWO CALLS.,"same time that he could only say “good-morning!” to her, and then stand"
442,TWO CALLS.,"in a corner, pulling his moustache and wishing that the others would"
443,TWO CALLS.,"go. There were so many roses in the room, bowls and vases and jars of"
444,TWO CALLS.,"them, that he thought she would not care for his single blossom, so he"
445,TWO CALLS.,put it in his buttonhole; but it gave him no pleasure whatever.
446,TWO CALLS.,
447,TWO CALLS.,Beau Bobby trotted away on his short legs till he came to a poor
448,TWO CALLS.,"street, full of tumble-down cottages."
449,TWO CALLS.,
450,TWO CALLS.,He stopped before one of them and knocked at the door. It was opened by
451,TWO CALLS.,"a motherly looking Irish woman, who looked as if she had just left the"
452,TWO CALLS.,"washtub, as, indeed, she had."
453,TWO CALLS.,
454,TWO CALLS.,"“Save us!” she cried, “is it yersilf, Master Bobby? Come in, me jewel,"
455,TWO CALLS.,and warm yersilf by the fire! It’s mortal cowld the day.”
456,TWO CALLS.,
457,TWO CALLS.,"“Oh, I’m not cold, thank you!” said Bobby. “But I will come in. Would"
458,TWO CALLS.,"you—would you like a rose, Mrs. Flanagan? I have brought this rose for"
459,TWO CALLS.,you. And I wish you a Happy New Year. And thank you for washing my
460,TWO CALLS.,shirts so nicely.”
461,TWO CALLS.,
462,TWO CALLS.,"This was a long speech for Beau Bobby, who was apt to be rather silent;"
463,TWO CALLS.,but it had a wonderful effect on Mrs. Flanagan. She grew very red as
464,TWO CALLS.,"she took the rose, and the tears came into her eyes."
465,TWO CALLS.,
466,TWO CALLS.,"“Ye little angil!” she said, wiping her eyes with her apron. “Look at"
467,TWO CALLS.,"the lovely rose! For me, is it? And who sint ye wid it, honey?”"
468,TWO CALLS.,
469,TWO CALLS.,"“Nobody!” said Bobby. “I brought it myself. It was my rose. You see,”"
470,TWO CALLS.,"he said, drawing his stool up to the little stove, “I heard you say,"
471,TWO CALLS.,"yesterday, Mrs. Flanagan, when you brought my shirts home, that you had"
472,TWO CALLS.,never had a New Year’s call in your life; so I thought I would make you
473,TWO CALLS.,"one to-day, you see. Happy New Year!”"
474,TWO CALLS.,
475,TWO CALLS.,"“Happy New Year to yersilf, me sweet jewel!” cried good Mrs. Flanagan."
476,TWO CALLS.,"“And blessings go wid every day of it, for your kind heart and your"
477,TWO CALLS.,"sweet face. I had a sore spot in my heart this day, Master Bobby, bein’"
478,TWO CALLS.,"so far from my own people; but it’s you have taken it away this minute,"
479,TWO CALLS.,"wid yer sweet rose and yer bright smile. See now, till I put it in my"
480,TWO CALLS.,"best chiny taypot. Ain’t that lovely, now?”"
481,TWO CALLS.,
482,TWO CALLS.,“Isn’t it!” cried Beau Bobby. “And it makes the whole room sweet. I am
483,TWO CALLS.,"enjoying my call _very_ much, Mrs. Flanagan; aren’t you?”"
484,TWO CALLS.,
485,TWO CALLS.,“That I am!” said Mrs. Flanagan. “With all my heart!”

523,NEW YEAR.,"THE little sweet Child tied on her hood, and put on her warm cloak and"
524,NEW YEAR.,"mittens. “I am going to the wood,” she said, “to tell the creatures all"
525,NEW YEAR.,"about it. They cannot understand about Christmas, mamma says, and of"
526,NEW YEAR.,"course she knows, but I do think they ought to know about New Year!”"
527,NEW YEAR.,
528,NEW YEAR.,"Out in the wood the snow lay light and powdery on the branches, but"
529,NEW YEAR.,"under foot it made a firm, smooth floor, over which the Child could"
530,NEW YEAR.,walk lightly without sinking in. She saw other footprints beside her
531,NEW YEAR.,"own, tiny bird-tracks, little hopping marks, which showed where a"
532,NEW YEAR.,"rabbit had taken his way, traces of mice and squirrels and other little"
533,NEW YEAR.,wild-wood beasts.
534,NEW YEAR.,
535,NEW YEAR.,"The Child stood under a great hemlock-tree, and looked up toward the"
536,NEW YEAR.,"clear blue sky, which shone far away beyond the dark tree-tops. She"
537,NEW YEAR.,"spread her hands abroad and called, “Happy New Year! Happy New Year to"
538,NEW YEAR.,"everybody in the wood, and all over the world!”"
539,NEW YEAR.,
540,NEW YEAR.,"A rustling was heard in the hemlock branches, and a striped squirrel"
541,NEW YEAR.,"peeped down at her. “What do you mean by that, little Child?” he asked."
542,NEW YEAR.,"And then from all around came other squirrels, came little field-mice,"
543,NEW YEAR.,"and hares swiftly leaping, and all the winter birds, titmouse and"
544,NEW YEAR.,"snow-bird, and many another; and they all wanted to know what the Child"
545,NEW YEAR.,"meant by her greeting, for they had never heard the words before."
546,NEW YEAR.,
547,NEW YEAR.,“It means that God is giving us another year!” said the Child. “Four
548,NEW YEAR.,"more seasons, each lovelier than the last, just as it was last year."
549,NEW YEAR.,"Flowers will bud, and then they will blossom, and then the fruit will"
550,NEW YEAR.,"hang all red and golden on the branches, for birds and men and"
551,NEW YEAR.,"little children to eat.” “And squirrels, too!” cried the chipmunk,"
552,NEW YEAR.,eagerly.
553,NEW YEAR.,
554,NEW YEAR.,[Illustration]
555,NEW YEAR.,
556,NEW YEAR.,"“Of course!” said the Child. “Squirrels, too, and every creature that"
557,NEW YEAR.,lives in the good green wood. And this is not all! We can do over again
558,NEW YEAR.,"the things that we tried to do last year, and perhaps failed in doing."
559,NEW YEAR.,"We have another chance to be good and kind, to do little loving things"
560,NEW YEAR.,"that help, and to cure ourselves of doing naughty things. Our hearts"
561,NEW YEAR.,"can have lovely new seasons, like the flowers and trees and all the"
562,NEW YEAR.,sweet things that grow and bear leaves and fruit. I thought I would
563,NEW YEAR.,"come and tell you all this, because sometimes one does not think of"
564,NEW YEAR.,things till one hears them from another’s lips. Are you glad I came? If
565,NEW YEAR.,"you are glad, say Happy New Year! each in his own way! I say it to you"
566,NEW YEAR.,all now in my way. Happy New Year! Happy New Year!”
567,NEW YEAR.,
568,NEW YEAR.,Such a noise as broke out then had never been heard in the wood since
569,NEW YEAR.,"the oldest hemlock was a baby, and that was a long time ago. Chirping,"
570,NEW YEAR.,"twittering, squeaking, chattering! The wood-doves lit on the Child’s"
571,NEW YEAR.,"shoulder and cooed in her ear, and she knew just what they said. The"
572,NEW YEAR.,"squirrels made a long speech, and meant every word of it, which is more"
573,NEW YEAR.,than people always do; the field-mouse said that she was going to turn
574,NEW YEAR.,"over a new leaf, the very biggest cabbage-leaf she could find; while"
575,NEW YEAR.,"the titmouse invited the whole company to dine with him, a thing he had"
576,NEW YEAR.,never done in his life before.
577,NEW YEAR.,
578,NEW YEAR.,"When the Child turned to leave the wood, the joyful chorus followed"
579,NEW YEAR.,"her, and she went, smiling, home and told her mother all about it."

656,THE RUBBER BABY.,
657,THE RUBBER BABY.,"There was also the best cousin, who is nine feet tall, more or less,"

660,THE RUBBER BABY.,
661,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Well, there we all were, and we fired crackers and torpedoes the whole"

663,THE RUBBER BABY.,"it to amuse the children, and the rest of us did it to amuse ourselves."
664,THE RUBBER BABY.,
665,THE RUBBER BABY.,"We had cannon-crackers a foot long; we had double-headers, which papa"

679,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Then we took counsel, and Mr. Bagabave said, “We will send up the"
680,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Rubber Baby.” Now the Rubber Baby belonged to Bay, and she loved him;"
681,THE RUBBER BABY.,but when Bunny and Mr. Bagabave told her what a fine thing it was to
682,THE RUBBER BABY.,"get up in the world, and how many people would like to go up farther"
683,THE RUBBER BABY.,"than the Rubber Baby would go, Bay consented, and went and brought the"
684,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Rubber Baby, who smiled and thought little of the matter."
685,THE RUBBER BABY.,
686,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Then Papa brought the biggest cannon-cracker of all, and made a long"
687,THE RUBBER BABY.,"fuse for it, and set it up in the ground; and over it he put a tomato"
688,THE RUBBER BABY.,"can, and on the tomato can he set the Rubber Baby."
689,THE RUBBER BABY.,
690,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Now all was ready, and we all stood waiting for the final moment. I do"
691,THE RUBBER BABY.,"not know what were the thoughts of the Rubber Baby at this moment, but"
692,THE RUBBER BABY.,we were all in a state of great excitement.
693,THE RUBBER BABY.,
694,THE RUBBER BABY.,"“Get out of the way, children!” cried Papa. “Run away, Bay! Get behind"
695,THE RUBBER BABY.,"the maple-tree, Mr. Bagabave! She’s going. Now, then! One, two, three,"
696,THE RUBBER BABY.,and away!” and Papa touched off the fuse.
697,THE RUBBER BABY.,
698,THE RUBBER BABY.,"A moment of great suspense, a tremendous report, a dense cloud of"
699,THE RUBBER BABY.,"smoke. Up soared the Rubber Baby, higher than the top of the big"
700,THE RUBBER BABY.,"maple-tree, almost to the very clouds (or so Bay thought)."
701,THE RUBBER BABY.,
702,THE RUBBER BABY.,"We watched in silent rapture; then, as the intrepid air-traveller came"
703,THE RUBBER BABY.,"down, still smiling, a loud cheer broke from the whole crowd."
704,THE RUBBER BABY.,
705,THE RUBBER BABY.,"No, not from the whole crowd; there was one exception. The kind"
706,THE RUBBER BABY.,gentleman who came to keep the best cousin from hurting himself gave a
707,THE RUBBER BABY.,"howl so loud and clear that we all started, and ran to see what was the"
708,THE RUBBER BABY.,matter.
709,THE RUBBER BABY.,
710,THE RUBBER BABY.,"The poor gentleman had been holding a cannon-cracker, which he was"
711,THE RUBBER BABY.,going to fire just when Papa gave the signal for sending off the Rubber
712,THE RUBBER BABY.,"Baby. In the excitement of the moment he forgot the cannon-cracker,"
713,THE RUBBER BABY.,"and it went off in his hand, and burnt him quite badly."
714,THE RUBBER BABY.,
715,THE RUBBER BABY.,"We were all very sorry, not only for the poor gentleman’s own sake, but"
716,THE RUBBER BABY.,because now there was no one to see that the best cousin did not hurt
717,THE RUBBER BABY.,himself.
718,THE RUBBER BABY.,
719,THE RUBBER BABY.,"A pretty young lady came, and tied up the poor gentleman’s hand so"
720,THE RUBBER BABY.,nicely with her soft handkerchief that he said he was glad the cracker
721,THE RUBBER BABY.,had gone off in it.
722,THE RUBBER BABY.,
723,THE RUBBER BABY.,"The Rubber Baby said nothing, but sat still in the middle of the gravel"
724,THE RUBBER BABY.,walk. Perhaps it was waiting to see if some lovely young lady would
725,THE RUBBER BABY.,come to cheer and comfort it; but no one came till little Bay took it
726,THE RUBBER BABY.,"up, wiped off the dust and powder, kissed it, and put it to bed."

750,"THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.","The standard-bearer dipped his flag as he passed Dorothy’s house, for"

761,"THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.","Then came a soldier who looked straight up at Dorothy, and held out his"

780,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
781,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I have the scarlet fever, and I live all alone with my Mamma in her"

783,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,more to see a girl who feels as well as I do.
784,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
785,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Mamma wears a cap and an apron, and we have our own dishes, just like"
786,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"play, and she washes them in a bright tin pan, and then I have the pan"
787,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"for a drum, and beat on it till she says she shall fly."
788,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
789,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I always stop then, for I do think I should be frightened to see Mamma"
790,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"fly. Besides, she might fly away."
791,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
792,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Well, yesterday was Christmas, and I could get out of bed and sit up in"
793,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,a chair; it was the first time.
794,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
795,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"So I sat up to dinner, and it was a partridge, but we played it was a"
796,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"turkey. There was jelly and macaroni, and for desert we had grapes and"
797,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"oranges. Mamma made it all look pretty, and Papa gave her roses through"
798,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"the door, and she put them all over the table."
799,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
800,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"When she had washed the dishes, she turned the big chair round so that"
801,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I could look out of the window, and Hal and John came out on the lawn"
802,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,and made a snow-man for me to look at.
803,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
804,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"It was a fine man, with two legs and two arms, and they kept playing he"
805,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"was the British, and knocking his head off."
806,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
807,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Mamma told me I mustn’t turn round till she said I might, but I didn’t"
808,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"want to, anyhow, the man was so funny."
809,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
810,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I heard Papa whispering at the door, and I _did_ want to see him, but I"
811,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"knew I couldn’t, ’cause the other children haven’t had the fever: and"
812,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"then I heard things rustle, paper and something soft, like brushing"
813,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,clothes.
814,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
815,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"They went on rustling, oh, a long time! and there was jingling, too,"
816,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"and I began to want to turn round _very_ much _indeed_; but I didn’t,"
817,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"of course, ’cause I said I wouldn’t."
818,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
819,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"_At last_ Mamma came up softly and tied something over my eyes, and"
820,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,told me to wait just a minute; and it really did not seem as if I could.
821,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
822,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Then she turned the chair round, and took the thing off my eyes,"
823,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,and—_what_ do you think was there?
824,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
825,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"A Christmas tree! A dear little ducky tree, just about as big as I am,"
826,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"and all lighted with red and blue candles, and silver stuff hanging"
827,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"like fringe from the branches, and real icicles. (No! Mamma says they"
828,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"are glass, but they look real. They are in a box now, and I can play"
829,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,with them.)
830,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
831,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,And everything on the tree was for me. That makes a rhyme. I often make
832,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,them.
833,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
834,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"There was a lovely doll, all china, with clothes to take off and"
835,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"put on, and buttons and buttonholes in everything. I have named her"
836,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Christine, because that is the most like Christmas of any name I know."
837,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
838,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"And a tin horse and cart, and a box of blocks, and a _lovely_ white"
839,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"china slate to draw on, and a box of beasts, not painted, all carved,"
840,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"just like real beasts, and a magnet-box, with three ducks and two"
841,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"swans and four goldfish and a little boat, all made of tin, and lots"
842,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,of oranges and a lovely china box full of cream candy (the doctor said
843,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I might have it if Aunt May made it, and she did), and a box of guava"
844,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"jelly, and a little angel at the top, flying, all of white china."
845,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
846,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"And _everything_ will wash except the things to eat, ’cause everything"
847,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"I play with has to be burned up, unless it can be washed, so they all"
848,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,gave me washing things.
849,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
850,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"Even Christine has china hair, and all her clothes are white, so they"
851,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"can be boiled, and so can she, and Mamma says it won’t hurt her at all."
852,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,
853,TOTTY’S CHRISTMAS.,"So I never had a nicer Christmas, though, of course, I wanted the other"

898,THE NEW SISTER.,
899,THE NEW SISTER.,The children stood on tiptoe and peeped into the tiny red face. They

903,THE NEW SISTER.,“Hasn’t she got any eyes?” he asked. “Or is she like kittens?”

926,THE NEW SISTER.,“But baby _is_ a girl!”
927,THE NEW SISTER.,
928,THE NEW SISTER.,“I don’t care. She needn’t have such a _very_ girly name. How do you

930,THE NEW SISTER.,
931,THE NEW SISTER.,"“Oh, Johnny! why, _everybody’s_ named Ellen. We don’t want her to be"

982,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"OH! the cupperty-buts! and oh! the cupperty-buts! out in the meadow,"

984,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"millions of them, each one a bit of purest gold from Mother Nature’s"
985,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"mint. Jessy stood at the window, looking out at them, and thinking, as"
986,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"she often had thought before, that there were no flowers so beautiful."
987,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Cupperty-buts,” she had been used to call them, when she was a wee"
988,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,baby-girl and could not speak without tumbling over her words and
989,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,mixing them up in the queerest fashion; and now that she was a very
990,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"great girl, actually six years old, they were still cupperty-buts to"
991,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"her, and would never be anything else, she said. There was nothing she"
992,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"liked better than to watch the lovely golden things, and nod to them"
993,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,as they nodded to her; but this morning her little face looked anxious
994,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"and troubled, and she gazed at the flowers with an intent and inquiring"
995,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"look, as if she had expected them to reply to her unspoken thoughts."
996,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,What these thoughts were I am going to tell you.
997,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
998,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Half an hour before, she had called to her mother, who was just going"
999,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"out, and begged her to come and look at the cupperty-buts."
1000,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1001,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“They are brighter than ever, Mamma! Do just come and look at them!"
1002,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"golden, golden, golden! There must be fifteen thousand million dollars’"
1003,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"worth of gold just on the lawn, I should think.”"
1004,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1005,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"And her mother, pausing to look out, said, very sadly,—"
1006,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1007,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Ah, my darling! if I only had this day a little of that gold, what a"
1008,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,happy woman I should be!”
1009,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1010,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"And then the good mother went out, and there little Jessy stood, gazing"
1011,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"at the flowers, and repeating the words to herself, over and over"
1012,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"again,—"
1013,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1014,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,“If I only had a little of that gold!”
1015,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1016,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"She knew that her mother was very, very poor, and had to go out to work"
1017,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,every day to earn food and clothes for herself and her little daughter;
1018,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,and the child’s tender heart ached to think of the sadness in the
1019,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"dear mother’s look and tone. Suddenly Jessy started, and the sunshine"
1020,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,flashed into her face.
1021,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1022,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Why!” she exclaimed, “why shouldn’t I get some of the gold from"
1023,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"the cupperty-buts? I believe I could get some, perfectly well. When"
1024,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Mamma wants to get the juice out of anything, meat, or fruit, or"
1025,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"anything of that sort, she just boils it. And so, if I should boil the"
1026,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"cupperty-buts, wouldn’t all the gold come out? Of course it would! Oh,"
1027,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,joy! how pleased Mamma will be!”
1028,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1029,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,Jessy’s actions always followed her thoughts with great rapidity. In
1030,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"five minutes she was out on the lawn, with a huge basket beside her,"
1031,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,pulling away at the buttercups with might and main. Oh! how small they
1032,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"were, and how long it took even to cover the bottom of the basket. But"
1033,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Jessy worked with a will, and at the end of an hour she had picked"
1034,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"enough to make at least a thousand dollars, as she calculated. That"
1035,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"would do for one day, she thought; and now for the grand experiment!"
1036,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,Before going out she had with much labor filled the great kettle with
1037,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"water, so now the water was boiling, and she had only to put the"
1038,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"buttercups in and put the cover on. When this was done, she sat as"
1039,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"patiently as she could, trying to pay attention to her knitting, and"
1040,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,not to look at the clock oftener than every two minutes.
1041,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1042,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“They must boil for an hour,” she said; “and by that time all the gold"
1043,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,will have come out.”
1044,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1045,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,[Illustration]
1046,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1047,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Well, the hour did pass, somehow or other, though it was a very long"
1048,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"one; and at eleven o’clock, Jessy, with a mighty effort, lifted the"
1049,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"kettle from the stove and carried it to the open door, that the fresh"
1050,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"air might cool the boiling water. At first, when she lifted the cover,"
1051,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,such a cloud of steam came out that she could see nothing; but in a
1052,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"moment the wind blew the steam aside, and then she saw,—oh, poor little"
1053,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Jessy!—she saw a mass of weeds floating about in a quantity of dirty,"
1054,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"greenish water, and that was all. Not the smallest trace of gold, even"
1055,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"in the buttercups themselves, was to be seen. Poor little Jessy! she"
1056,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"tried hard not to cry, but it was a bitter disappointment; the tears"
1057,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"came rolling down her cheeks faster and faster, till at length she sat"
1058,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"down by the kettle, and, burying her face in her apron, sobbed as if"
1059,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,her heart would break.
1060,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1061,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Presently, through her sobs, she heard a kind voice saying, “What"
1062,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"is the matter, little one? Why do you cry so bitterly?” She looked"
1063,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"up and saw an old gentleman with white hair and a bright, cheery"
1064,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"face, standing by her. At first, Jessy could say nothing but “Oh!"
1065,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"the cupperty-buts! oh! the cupperty-buts!” but, of course, the old"
1066,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"gentleman didn’t know what she meant by that, so, as he urged her"
1067,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"to tell him about her trouble, she dried her eyes, and told him the"
1068,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"melancholy little story: how her mother was very poor, and said she"
1069,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,wished she had some gold; and how she herself had tried to get the gold
1070,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,out of the buttercups by boiling them. “I was so sure I could get it
1071,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"out,” she said, “and I thought Mamma would be so pleased! And now—”"
1072,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1073,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,Here she was very near breaking down again; but the gentleman patted
1074,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"her head and said, cheerfully, “Wait a bit, little woman! Don’t give"
1075,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"up the ship yet. You know that gold is heavy, very heavy indeed, and"
1076,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"if there were any it would be at the very bottom of the kettle, all"
1077,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"covered with the weeds, so that you could not see it. I should not be"
1078,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"at all surprised if you found some, after all. Run into the house and"
1079,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"bring me a spoon with a long handle, and we will fish in the kettle,"
1080,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,and see what we can find.”
1081,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1082,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Jessy’s face brightened, and she ran into the house. If any one had"
1083,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"been standing near just at that moment, I think it is possible that he"
1084,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,might have seen the old gentleman’s hand go into his pocket and out
1085,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"again very quickly, and might have heard a little splash in the kettle;"
1086,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"but nobody was near, so, of course, I cannot say anything about it. At"
1087,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"any rate, when Jessy came out with the spoon, he was standing with both"
1088,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"hands in his pockets, looking in the opposite direction. He took the"
1089,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,great iron spoon and fished about in the kettle for some time. At last
1090,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"there was a little clinking noise, and the old gentleman lifted the"
1091,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"spoon. Oh, wonder and delight! In it lay three great, broad, shining"
1092,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,pieces of gold! Jessy could hardly believe her eyes. She stared and
1093,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"stared; and when the old gentleman put the gold into her hand, she"
1094,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"still stood as if in a happy dream, gazing at it. Suddenly she started,"
1095,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,and remembered that she had not thanked her kindly helper. She looked
1096,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"up, and began, “Thank you, sir;” but the old gentleman was gone."
1097,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1098,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Well, the next question was, How could Jessy possibly wait till twelve"
1099,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,o’clock for her mother to come home? Knitting was out of the question.
1100,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"She could do nothing but dance and look out of window, and look out"
1101,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"of window and dance, holding the precious coins tight in her hand. At"
1102,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"last, a well-known footstep was heard outside the door, and Mrs. Gray"
1103,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"came in, looking very tired and worn. She smiled, however, when she saw"
1104,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Jessy, and said,—"
1105,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1106,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Well, my darling, I am glad to see you looking so bright. How has the"
1107,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,morning gone with my little housekeeper?”
1108,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1109,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Oh, mother!” cried Jessy, hopping about on one foot, “it has gone very"
1110,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"well! oh, very, _very_, _very_ well! Oh, my mother dear, what do you"
1111,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"think I have got in my hand? _What_ do you think? oh, what _do_ you"
1112,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"think?” and she went dancing round and round, till poor Mrs. Gray was"
1113,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"quite dizzy with watching her. At last she stopped, and holding out her"
1114,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"hand, opened it and showed her mother what was in it. Mrs. Gray was"
1115,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,really frightened.
1116,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1117,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Jessy, my child!” she cried, “where did you get all that money?”"
1118,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1119,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Out of the cupperty-buts, Mamma!” said Jessy, “out of the"
1120,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"cupperty-buts! and it’s all for you, every bit of it! Dear Mamma, now"
1121,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"you will be happy, will you not?”"
1122,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1123,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Jessy,” said Mrs. Gray, “have you lost your senses, or are you playing"
1124,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"some trick on me? Tell me all about this at once, dear child, and don’t"
1125,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,talk nonsense.”
1126,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1127,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“But it isn’t nonsense, Mamma!” cried Jessy, “and it did come out of"
1128,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,the cupperty-buts!”
1129,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1130,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,And then she told her mother the whole story. The tears came into Mrs.
1131,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"Gray’s eyes, but they were tears of joy and gratitude."
1132,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,
1133,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"“Jessy dear,” she said, “when we say our prayers at night, let us never"
1134,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,forget to pray for that good gentleman. May Heaven bless him and reward
1135,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,"him! for if it had not been for him, Jessy dear, I fear you would never"
1136,BUTTERCUP GOLD.,have found the ‘Buttercup Gold.’”

1144,ONE AFTERNOON.,"PAPA and Mamma went out to row,"
1145,ONE AFTERNOON.,"And left us alone at home, you know,—"
1146,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Roderick, James and me."
1147,ONE AFTERNOON.,"“My dears,” they said, “now play with your toys"

1150,ONE AFTERNOON.,
1151,ONE AFTERNOON.,We played with our toys the _longest_ while!
1152,ONE AFTERNOON.,"We built up the blocks for nearly a mile,—"

1154,ONE AFTERNOON.,"But when they came tumbling down, alas!"

1156,ONE AFTERNOON.,Oh! _how_ the pieces did fly!
1157,ONE AFTERNOON.,
1158,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Then we played the stairs were an Alpine peak,"

1160,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Roderick, I and James."
1161,ONE AFTERNOON.,"But Jim caught his jacket upon a tack,"
1162,ONE AFTERNOON.,"And I burst the buttons all off my back,"
1163,ONE AFTERNOON.,And Roderick called us names.
1164,ONE AFTERNOON.,
1165,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Then we found a pillow that had a rip,"
1166,ONE AFTERNOON.,"And all the feathers we out did slip,—"
1167,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Roderick, James and I."
1168,ONE AFTERNOON.,"And we made a snowstorm, a glorious one,"

1175,ONE AFTERNOON.,"Oh! terrible, terrible things they said!"

1187,THE STOVE.,"is not quite so big. It has pots and kettles and a frying-pan, and a"
1188,THE STOVE.,"soup-pot, and the oven bakes beautifully, and it is just lovely! I"
1189,THE STOVE.,"went to spend the afternoon with her yesterday, and we cooked all the"
1190,THE STOVE.,"time, except when we were eating. First, we made soup in the soup-pot,"
1191,THE STOVE.,"with some pieces of cold goose, and we took some to Auntie (she is"
1192,THE STOVE.,"Betty’s mother), and she said it was de-licious, and took two cups of"
1193,THE STOVE.,"it. (They were doll’s cups; Betty says I ought to put that in, but I"
1194,THE STOVE.,"don’t see any need.) Then we made scrambled egg and porridge, and baked"
1195,THE STOVE.,"some custard in the oven, and it was just exactly like a big custard"
1196,THE STOVE.,"in the big cups at home. The cake was queer, so I won’t stop to tell"
1197,THE STOVE.,"about that, though Rover ate most of it, and the rest we crumbled up"
1198,THE STOVE.,"for the pigeons, so it wasn’t wasted; but the best of all was the"
1199,THE STOVE.,"griddle-cakes. Oh, they were splendid! The griddle is just the right"
1200,THE STOVE.,"size for one, so they were as round as pennies, and about the same"
1201,THE STOVE.,"size; and we had maple syrup on them, and Maggie the cook said she"
1202,THE STOVE.,was so jealous (she called it “jellies”) that she should go straight
1203,THE STOVE.,back to Ireland; but I don’t believe she will. I don’t feel very well
1204,THE STOVE.,"to-day, and Betty wasn’t at school, either. But I don’t think it had"

1291,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“WAKE up!” said an old gentleman, dressed in brown and white, as he"
1292,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"gently shook the shoulder of a young lady in green, who was lying sound"
1293,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"asleep under the trees. “Wake up, ma’am! it is your watch now, and time"
1294,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,for me to take myself off.”
1295,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1296,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The young lady stirred a very little, and opened one of her eyes the"
1297,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"least little bit. “Who are you?” she said, drowsily. “What is your"
1298,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,name?”
1299,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1300,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“My name is Winter,” replied the old man. “What is yours?”"
1301,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1302,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“I have not the faintest idea,” said the lady, closing her eyes again."
1303,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1304,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Humph!” growled the old man, “a pretty person you are to take my"
1305,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"place! Well, good-day, Madam Sleepyhead, and good luck to you!”"
1306,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1307,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"And off he stumped over the dead leaves, which crackled and rustled"
1308,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,beneath his feet.
1309,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1310,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"As soon as he was gone, the young lady in green opened her eyes in good"
1311,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,earnest and looked about her.
1312,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1313,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Madam Sleepyhead, indeed!” she re-echoed, indignantly. “I am sure"
1314,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"_that_ is not my name, anyhow. The question is, What _is_ it?”"
1315,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1316,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"She looked about her again, but nothing was to be seen save the"
1317,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"bare branches of the trees, and the dead, brown leaves and dry moss"
1318,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,underfoot.
1319,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1320,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Trees, do you happen to know what my name is?” she asked."
1321,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1322,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The trees shook their heads. “No, ma’am,” they said, “we do not know;"
1323,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"but perhaps when the Wind comes, he will be able to give you some"
1324,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,information.”
1325,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1326,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The girl shivered a little, and drew her green mantle about her and"
1327,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,waited.
1328,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1329,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,By and by the Wind came blustering along. He caught the trees by their
1330,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"branches, and shook them in rough, though friendly greeting."
1331,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1332,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Well, boys!” he shouted, “Old Winter is gone, is he? I wish you joy of"
1333,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,his departure! But where is the lady who was coming to take his place?”
1334,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1335,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“She is here,” answered the trees, “sitting on the ground; but she does"
1336,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"not know her own name, which seems to trouble her.”"
1337,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1338,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Ho! ho!” roared the Wind. “Not know her own name? That is news,"
1339,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"indeed! And here she has been sleeping, while all the world has been"
1340,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"looking for her, and calling her, and wondering where upon earth she"
1341,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"was. Come, young lady,” he added, addressing the girl with rough"
1342,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"courtesy, “I will show you the way to your dressing-room, which has"
1343,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,been ready and waiting for you for a fortnight and more.”
1344,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1345,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"So he led the way through the forest, and the girl followed, rubbing"
1346,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"her pretty, sleepy eyes, and dragging her mantle behind her."
1347,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1348,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,Now it was a very singular thing that whatever the green mantle
1349,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"touched, instantly turned green itself. The brown moss put out little"
1350,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"tufts of emerald velvet, fresh shoots came pushing up from the dead,"
1351,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"dry grass, and even the shrubs and twigs against which the edges of the"
1352,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"garment brushed broke out with tiny swelling buds, all ready to open"
1353,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,into leaves.
1354,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1355,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"By and by the Wind paused and pushed aside the branches, which made a"
1356,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,close screen before him.
1357,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1358,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"“Here is your dressing-room, young madam,” he said, with a low bow; “be"
1359,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"pleased to enter it, and you will find all things in readiness. But"
1360,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"let me entreat you to make your toilet speedily, for all the world is"
1361,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,waiting for you.”
1362,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1363,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"Greatly wondering, the young girl passed through the screen of"
1364,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"branches, and found herself in a most marvellous place."
1365,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1366,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The ground was carpeted with pine-needles, soft and thick and brown."
1367,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The pine-trees made a dense green wall around, and as the wind"
1368,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"passed softly through the boughs, the air was sweet with their spicy"
1369,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"fragrance. On the ground were piled great heaps of buds, all ready to"
1370,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"blossom; violets, anemones, hepaticas, blood-root, while from under a"
1371,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,huge pile of brown leaves peeped the pale pink buds of the Mayflower.
1372,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1373,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,The young girl in the green mantle looked wonderingly at all these
1374,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"things. “How strange!” she said. “They are all asleep, and waiting for"
1375,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"some one to waken them. Perhaps if I do it, they will tell me in return"
1376,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,what my name is.”
1377,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1378,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"She shook the buds lightly, and lo! every blossom opened its eyes and"
1379,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"raised its head, and said, “Welcome, gracious lady! welcome! We have"
1380,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"looked for you long, long!”"
1381,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,
1382,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"The young girl, in delight, took the lovely blossoms, rosy and purple,"
1383,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"golden and white, and twined them in her fair locks, and hung them"
1384,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,in garlands round her white neck; and still they were opening by
1385,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,"thousands, till the pine-tree hollow was filled with them."
1386,WHAT WAS HER NAME?,

1489,THE PATIENT CAT.,"WHEN the spotted cat first found the nest, there was nothing in it, for"
1490,THE PATIENT CAT.,"it was only just finished. So she said, “I will wait!” for she was a"
1491,THE PATIENT CAT.,"patient cat, and the summer was before her. She waited a week, and then"
1492,THE PATIENT CAT.,"she climbed up again to the top of the tree, and peeped into the nest."
1493,THE PATIENT CAT.,"There lay two lovely blue eggs, smooth and shining."
1494,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1495,THE PATIENT CAT.,"The spotted cat said, “Eggs may be good, but young birds are better. I"
1496,THE PATIENT CAT.,"will wait.” So she waited; and while she was waiting, she caught mice"
1497,THE PATIENT CAT.,"and rats, and washed herself and slept, and did all that a spotted cat"
1498,THE PATIENT CAT.,should do to pass the time away.
1499,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1500,THE PATIENT CAT.,"When another week had passed, she climbed the tree again and peeped"
1501,THE PATIENT CAT.,into the nest. This time there were five eggs. But the spotted cat said
1502,THE PATIENT CAT.,"again, “Eggs may be good, but young birds are better. I will wait a"
1503,THE PATIENT CAT.,little longer!”
1504,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1505,THE PATIENT CAT.,So she waited a little longer and then went up again to look. Ah! there
1506,THE PATIENT CAT.,"were five tiny birds, with big eyes and long necks, and yellow beaks"
1507,THE PATIENT CAT.,"wide open. Then the spotted cat sat down on the branch, and licked"
1508,THE PATIENT CAT.,"her nose and purred, for she was very happy. “It is worth while to be"
1509,THE PATIENT CAT.,patient!” she said.
1510,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1511,THE PATIENT CAT.,"But when she looked again at the young birds, to see which one she"
1512,THE PATIENT CAT.,"should take first, she saw that they were very thin,—oh, very, very"
1513,THE PATIENT CAT.,thin they were! The spotted cat had never seen anything so thin in her
1514,THE PATIENT CAT.,life.
1515,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1516,THE PATIENT CAT.,"“Now,” she said to herself, “if I were to wait only a few days longer,"
1517,THE PATIENT CAT.,"they would grow fat. Thin birds may be good, but fat birds are much"
1518,THE PATIENT CAT.,better. I will wait!”
1519,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1520,THE PATIENT CAT.,So she waited; and she watched the father-bird bringing worms all day
1521,THE PATIENT CAT.,"long to the nest, and said, “Aha! they must be fattening fast! they"
1522,THE PATIENT CAT.,will soon be as fat as I wish them to be. Aha! what a good thing it is
1523,THE PATIENT CAT.,to be patient.”
1524,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1525,THE PATIENT CAT.,"At last, one day she thought, “Surely, now they must be fat enough! I"
1526,THE PATIENT CAT.,will not wait another day. Aha! how good they will be!”
1527,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1528,THE PATIENT CAT.,"So she climbed up the tree, licking her chops all the way and thinking"
1529,THE PATIENT CAT.,of the fat young birds. And when she reached the top and looked into
1530,THE PATIENT CAT.,"the nest, it was empty!!"
1531,THE PATIENT CAT.,
1532,THE PATIENT CAT.,"Then the spotted cat sat down on the branch and spoke thus, “Well, of"

1614,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,THERE was only one chapter more to finish the book. Bell did want very
1615,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"much indeed to finish it, and to make sure that the princess got out"
1616,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"of the enchanted wood all right, and that the golden prince met her,"
1617,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,riding on a jet-black charger and leading a snow-white palfrey with a

1622,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1623,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,First it was dear Mamma calling for a glass of water from her sofa in
1624,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"the next room, and of course Bell sprang with alacrity to answer _that_"
1625,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,call.
1626,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1627,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"But then baby came, with a scratched finger to be tied up, and then"
1628,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Willy boy wanted some more tail for his kite, and he could not find"

1633,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1634,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"So sister looked, and Carrie looked, too, and between them they upset"
1635,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"the basket, and the spools rolled over the floor and under the chairs,"
1636,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,as if they were playing a game; and the gray kitten caught her best
1637,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"spool of gold-colored floss, and had a delightful time with it, and got"
1638,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"it all mixed up with her claws so that she couldn’t help herself, and"
1639,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,Bell had to cut off yards and yards of the silk.
1640,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1641,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"At last it was settled, and the little girl supplied with buttons, and"
1642,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Bell sank back again on the window-seat, _so_ glad that she hadn’t been"
1643,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"impatient, and had seen how funny the kitten looked, so that she could"

1645,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1646,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"“And when the golden prince saw the Princess Merveille, he took her"

1649,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1650,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Tinkle! tinkle! went the door-bell, and Bell, with a long sigh, laid"
1651,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"down the book and went to the door, for Mary was out. It was old Mr."

1653,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1654,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"“Good-day, miss!” he said, with old-fashioned courtesy, “I have come"

1656,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"father, and he was good enough to say that you would find the book for"
1657,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,me. I am of the opinion that he mentioned the right-hand corner of the
1658,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,third shelf in some bookcase; I do not rightly remember in which room.”
1659,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1660,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Bell showed the old gentleman into the study and brought him a chair,"
1661,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,and looked in the right-hand corners of all the shelves; then she
1662,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,looked in the left-hand corners; then she looked in the middle; then
1663,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"she looked on Papa’s desk, and in it and under it."
1664,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1665,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Then she looked on the mantel-piece, and in the cupboard, and in"
1666,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"the chairs, for there was no knowing _where_ dear Papa would put a"
1667,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,book down when his thinking-cap was on. All the time Mr. Grimshaw
1668,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"was delivering a lecture on Paley, and telling her on what points he"
1669,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"disagreed with him, and why; and Bell felt as if a teetotum were going"
1670,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,round and round inside her head.
1671,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1672,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"At last, in lifting Papa’s dressing-gown, which hung on the back of"
1673,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"a chair, she felt something square and heavy in one of the pockets;"
1674,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,and—_there_ was the third volume of “Paley’s Evidences.”
1675,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1676,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"She handed it to Mr. Grimshaw with her prettiest smile, and he went"
1677,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"away thinking she was a very nice, well-mannered little girl."
1678,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1679,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,And so she was; but—oh dear! when she got back to the window-seat the
1680,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,daylight was nearly gone.
1681,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1682,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Still, the west was very bright, and perhaps she could just find out."

1684,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"“And he said, ‘Princess, my heart is yours! Therefore, I pray you,"

1689,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1690,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"“Bell!” called Mamma from the next room. “It is too late to read, dear!"
1691,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Blindman’s Holiday, you know, is the most dangerous time for the eyes."
1692,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"So shut the book, like a dear daughter!”"
1693,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1694,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Bell shut the book, of course; but a cloud came over her pleasant face,"
1695,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,and two little cross sticks began beating a tattoo on her heart.
1696,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1697,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"Just at that moment came voices under the window,—Carrie and Willy boy,"
1698,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"talking earnestly. “Would a princess be very pretty, do you suppose,"
1699,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,Willy? prettier than Bell?”
1700,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1701,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"“Ho!” said Willy, “who cares for ‘pretty?’ She wouldn’t be half so nice"
1702,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,"as Bell. Why, none of the other fellows’ sisters—”"
1703,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,
1704,BY THE FADING LIGHT.,They passed out of hearing; and even so the cloud passed away from

1783,THE LAZY ROBIN.,THE LAZY ROBIN.
1784,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1785,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1786,THE LAZY ROBIN.,THE mother robin woke up in the early morning and roused her three
1787,THE LAZY ROBIN.,children.
1788,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1789,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“Breakfast time, my dears!” she said; “and a good time for a flying"
1790,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"lesson, besides. You did well enough yesterday, but to-day you must do"
1791,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"better. You must fly down to the ground, and then I will show you how"
1792,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"to get worms for yourselves. You will soon be too old to be fed, and I"
1793,THE LAZY ROBIN.,cannot have you more backward than the other broods.”
1794,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1795,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"The young robins were rather frightened, for they had only had two"
1796,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"short flying lessons, taking little flapping flutters among the"
1797,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"branches. The ground seemed a long, long way off!"
1798,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1799,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"However, two of them scrambled on to the edge of the nest, and after"
1800,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"balancing themselves for a moment, launched bravely out, and were soon"
1801,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"standing beside their mother on the lawn, trembling, but very proud."
1802,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1803,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"The third robin was lazy, and did not want to fly. He thought that if"
1804,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"he stayed behind and said he was sick, his mother would bring some"
1805,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"worms up to him, as she had always done before. So he sat still in the"
1806,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"nest, and drooped his head."
1807,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1808,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“Come along!” cried the mother robin. “Come, Pecky! Why are you sitting"
1809,THE LAZY ROBIN.,there alone?”
1810,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1811,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“I—don’t feel very well,” said Pecky. “I don’t feel strong enough to"
1812,THE LAZY ROBIN.,fly.”
1813,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1814,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“Oh!” said his mother, “then you had better not eat any breakfast, and"
1815,THE LAZY ROBIN.,I will send for Doctor Woodpecker.”
1816,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1817,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“Oh no, please don’t!” cried Pecky, and down he fluttered to the lawn."
1818,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1819,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"“That’s right!” said the mother robin, approvingly. “I thought there"
1820,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"was not much the matter with you. Now bustle about, my dear! See how"
1821,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"well your brother and sister are doing! I declare, Toppy has got hold"
1822,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"of a worm as long as himself. It will get away from him—no, it won’t!"
1823,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"There! he has it now! Ah! that was a good mouthful, Toppy. You will be"
1824,THE LAZY ROBIN.,a fine eater!”
1825,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1826,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"Pecky sat still, with his head on one side. He felt quite sure that if"
1827,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"he waited and did nothing, his mother would take compassion on him and"
1828,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"bring him some worms. There were Toppy and Flappy, working themselves"
1829,THE LAZY ROBIN.,to death in the hot sun. He had always been his mother’s favourite (so
1830,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"he thought, but it was not really so), and he was quite sure that she"
1831,THE LAZY ROBIN.,would not let him go hungry.
1832,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1833,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"So he gave a little squeak, as if quite tired out, and put his head"
1834,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"still more on one side, and shut his eyes, and sat still. Now his"
1835,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"mother did not see him at all, for her back was turned, and she was"
1836,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"eating a fine caterpillar, having no idea of waiting on lazy birds who"
1837,THE LAZY ROBIN.,were old enough to feed themselves.
1838,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1839,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"But some one else did see Master Pecky! Richard Whittington, the great"
1840,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"gray cat, had come out to get his breakfast, too, and he saw the lazy"
1841,THE LAZY ROBIN.,robin sitting still in the middle of the lawn with his eyes shut.
1842,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1843,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"Richard could not have caught one of the others, for they all had their"
1844,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"wits about them, and their sharp black eyes glanced here and there, and"
1845,THE LAZY ROBIN.,they were ready to take flight at a moment’s notice.
1846,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1847,THE LAZY ROBIN.,But Richard Whittington crept nearer and nearer to the lazy robin.
1848,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"Suddenly—pounce! he went. There was a shrill, horrified squeak, and"
1849,THE LAZY ROBIN.,that was the last of poor Pecky Robin.
1850,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1851,THE LAZY ROBIN.,The mother robin and her two other children flew up into the tree and
1852,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"grieved bitterly for their lost Pecky, and the mother did not taste a"
1853,THE LAZY ROBIN.,single worm for several hours.
1854,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1855,THE LAZY ROBIN.,But Richard Whittington enjoyed his breakfast exceedingly; and he was
1856,THE LAZY ROBIN.,"as good-natured as possible all day, and did not scratch the baby once."
1857,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1858,THE LAZY ROBIN.,
1859,THE LAZY ROBIN.,

1861,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,THE BOY’S MANNERS.
1862,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1863,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1864,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"THE Boy was going out to Roxbury. He was going alone, though he was"
1865,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"only five years old. His Aunt Mary had put him in the horse car, and"
1866,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,the car went directly past his house; and the Boy “hoped he _did_ know
1867,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,enough to ask somebody big to ask the conductor to stop the car.”
1868,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1869,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"So there the Boy was, all alone and very proud, with his legs sticking"
1870,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"straight out, because they were not long enough to hang over,—but he"
1871,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"did not mind that, because it showed his trousers all the better,—and"
1872,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,his five cents clutched tight in his little warm hand.
1873,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1874,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"Proud as he was, the Boy had a slight feeling of uneasiness somewhere"
1875,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,down in the bottom of his heart. His Aunt Mary had just been reading
1876,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“Jack and the Bean-stalk” to him, and he was not quite sure that the"
1877,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"man opposite him was not an ogre. He was a very, very large man, about"
1878,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"twelve feet tall, the boy thought, and at least nine feet round. He had"
1879,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"a wide mouth, full of sharp-looking teeth, and he rolled his eyes as he"
1880,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"read the newspaper. He was not dressed like an ogre, and he carried no"
1881,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,knife in sight; but it might be in one of the pockets of his big gray
1882,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,coat.
1883,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1884,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"Altogether, the Boy did not like the looks of this man at all, but"
1885,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,nobody else seemed to mind him. A pretty girl sat down close beside
1886,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"him,—a plump, tender-looking young girl,—but the big man took no notice"
1887,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"of her or anybody else, and kept on reading his newspaper and rolling"
1888,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,his eyes.
1889,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1890,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"So the Boy sat still, only keeping a good lookout, so that if this"
1891,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"formidable person _should_ pull out a knife, or begin to grind his"
1892,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"teeth and roar, “Fee! fi! fo! fum!” he could slip off the seat and out"
1893,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,at the door before his huge enemy could get upon his feet.
1894,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1895,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The car began to fill up rapidly. Soon every seat was occupied, and"
1896,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"several men were standing up. One of them trod, by accident, on the"
1897,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"ogre’s toe,—the Boy could not help calling him the ogre, though he"
1898,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"felt it might not be right,—and he gave a kind of growl, which made"
1899,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,the Boy quiver and prepare to jump; but his eyes never moved from his
1900,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"newspaper, so the Boy sat still."
1901,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1902,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"By and by a poor woman got in, with a heavy baby in her arms. She"
1903,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"looked very tired, but though there were several other men sitting down"
1904,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"beside the big gray one, no one moved to give the woman a seat."
1905,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1906,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The boy remembered his manners, and knew that he ought to get up; but"
1907,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"then came the thought, “If I get up, I shall be close to the ogre, for"
1908,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,there is no standing-room anywhere else. I am wedged so close between
1909,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"these two ladies that I can hardly get out: and if I do, there cannot"
1910,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,possibly be room for that large woman.”
1911,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1912,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The Boy gave heed to this thought, though he knew in his heart that it"
1913,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,did not make any difference. Just then the tired woman gave a sigh and
1914,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,shifted the heavy baby to the other arm.
1915,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1916,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The Boy did not wait any longer, but slipped at once down from his"
1917,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"seat. “Here is a little room, ma’am!” he said, in his clear, childish"
1918,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"voice. “There isn’t enough for you, but you might put the baby down,"
1919,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,and rest your arms.”
1920,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1921,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"At that moment the car gave a lurch, and the Boy lost his balance and"
1922,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"fell forward,—right against the knees of the ogre."
1923,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1924,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“Hi! hi!” said the big man, putting aside his newspaper, “what’s all"
1925,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,this? Hey?”
1926,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1927,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The Boy could not speak for fright; but the poor woman answered, “It’s"
1928,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"the dear little gentleman offering me his seat for the baby, sir! The"
1929,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,Lord bless him for a little jewel that he is!”
1930,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1931,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“Hi! hi!” growled the big man, getting heavily up from his seat and"
1932,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"still holding the boy’s arm, which he had grasped as the child fell,"
1933,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“this won’t do! One gentleman in the car, eh? And an old fellow reading"
1934,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"his newspaper! Here, sit down here, my friend!” and he helped the woman"
1935,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"to his seat, and bowed to her as if she were a duchess. “And as for"
1936,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"you, Hop-o’-my-thumb—” Then he stooped and took the Boy up, and set him"
1937,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"on his left arm, which was as big as a table. “There, sir!” he said,"
1938,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“sit you there and be comfortable, as you deserve.”"
1939,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1940,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The Boy sat very still; indeed, he was too frightened to move. Since"
1941,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"the man had called him Hop-o’-my-thumb, he was quite sure that he"
1942,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,must be an ogre; perhaps the very ogre from whom Hop and his brothers
1943,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"escaped. The book said he died, but books do not always tell the truth;"
1944,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,Papa said so.
1945,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1946,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,When the big man began to feel in the right-hand pockets of his gray
1947,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"coat, the child trembled so excessively that he shook the great arm on"
1948,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,which he sat.
1949,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1950,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The man looked quickly at him. “What is the matter, my lad?” he asked;"
1951,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"and his voice, though gruff, did not sound unkind. “You are not afraid"
1952,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"of a big man, are you? Do you think I am an ogre?”"
1953,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1954,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“Yes!” said the boy; and he gave one sob, and then stopped himself."
1955,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1956,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"The gray man burst into a great roar of laughter, which made every one"
1957,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,in the car jump in his seat.
1958,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1959,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"Still laughing, he drew his hand from his pocket, and in it was—not"
1960,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"a knife, but a beautiful, shining, golden pear. “Take that, young"
1961,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"Hop-o’-my-thumb,” he said, putting it in the Boy’s hands. “If you will"
1962,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"eat that, I promise not to eat you,—not even to take a single bite. Are"
1963,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,you satisfied?”
1964,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1965,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,The boy ventured to raise his eyes to the man’s face; and there he
1966,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"saw such a kind, funny, laughing look that before he knew it he was"
1967,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"laughing, too."
1968,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1969,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“I don’t believe you are an ogre, after all!” he said."
1970,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1971,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"“Don’t you?” said the big man. “Well, neither do I! But you may as well"
1972,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,"eat the pear, just the same.”"
1973,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,
1974,THE BOY’S MANNERS.,And the Boy did.

2055,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2056,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2057,IN THE TUNNEL.,WILL was digging a tunnel in the long drift. It was the longest drift
2058,IN THE TUNNEL.,"that Will had ever seen, and he had meant to have Harry help him, but"
2059,IN THE TUNNEL.,"now they had quarrelled, and were never going to speak to each other as"
2060,IN THE TUNNEL.,"long as they lived, so Will had to begin alone."
2061,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2062,IN THE TUNNEL.,"He dug and dug, taking up great solid blocks of snow on his shovel, and"
2063,IN THE TUNNEL.,"tossing them over his shoulder in a workman-like manner. As he dug,"
2064,IN THE TUNNEL.,he kept saying to himself that Harry was the hatefullest boy he ever
2065,IN THE TUNNEL.,"saw in his life, and that he was glad he shouldn’t see anything more"
2066,IN THE TUNNEL.,"of him. It would seem queer, to be sure, not to play with him every"
2067,IN THE TUNNEL.,"day, for they had always played together ever since they put on short"
2068,IN THE TUNNEL.,"clothes; but Will didn’t care. He wasn’t going to be “put upon,” and"
2069,IN THE TUNNEL.,Master Harry would find that out.
2070,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2071,IN THE TUNNEL.,It was a very long drift. Will had never made such a fine tunnel; it
2072,IN THE TUNNEL.,"did seem a pity that there should be no one to play with him in it,"
2073,IN THE TUNNEL.,when it was done. But there was not a soul; for that Weaver boy was so
2074,IN THE TUNNEL.,"rude, he did not want to have anything to do with him, and there was no"
2075,IN THE TUNNEL.,"one else of his age except Harry, and he should never see Harry again,"
2076,IN THE TUNNEL.,at least not to speak to.
2077,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2078,IN THE TUNNEL.,Dig! dig! dig! How pleasant it would be if somebody were digging from
2079,IN THE TUNNEL.,"the other end, so that they could meet in the middle, and then play"
2080,IN THE TUNNEL.,"robbers in a cave, or miners, or travellers lost in the snow. That"
2081,IN THE TUNNEL.,"would be the best, because Spot could be the faithful hound, and drag"
2082,IN THE TUNNEL.,"them out by the hair, and have a bottle of milk round his neck for"
2083,IN THE TUNNEL.,"them to drink. Spot was pretty small, but they could wriggle along"
2084,IN THE TUNNEL.,"themselves, and make believe he was dragging them. It would be fun! but"
2085,IN THE TUNNEL.,"he didn’t suppose he should have any fun now, since Harry had been so"
2086,IN THE TUNNEL.,"hateful, and they were never—no, never going to speak again, if it was"
2087,IN THE TUNNEL.,ever so—
2088,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2089,IN THE TUNNEL.,What was that noise? Could it be possible that he was getting to the
2090,IN THE TUNNEL.,"end of the drift? It was as dark as ever,—the soft, white darkness of a"
2091,IN THE TUNNEL.,"snowdrift; but he certainly heard a noise close by, as if some one were"
2092,IN THE TUNNEL.,digging very near him. What if—
2093,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2094,IN THE TUNNEL.,"Willy redoubled his efforts, and the noise grew louder and louder;"
2095,IN THE TUNNEL.,"presently a dog barked, and Will started, for he knew the sound of the"
2096,IN THE TUNNEL.,"bark. Just then the shovel sank into the snow and through it, and in"
2097,IN THE TUNNEL.,"the opening appeared Harry’s head, and the end of Spot’s nose. “Hullo,"
2098,IN THE TUNNEL.,Will!” said Harry.
2099,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2100,IN THE TUNNEL.,"“Hullo, Harry!” said Will."
2101,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2102,IN THE TUNNEL.,“Let’s play travellers in the snow!” said Harry. “This is just the
2103,IN THE TUNNEL.,"middle of the drift, and we can be jolly and lost.”"
2104,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2105,IN THE TUNNEL.,"“All right!” said Will, “let’s!”"
2106,IN THE TUNNEL.,
2107,IN THE TUNNEL.,"They had a glorious play, and took turns in being the traveller and the"
2108,IN THE TUNNEL.,"pious monk of Saint Bernard; and they both felt so warm inside, they"
2109,IN THE TUNNEL.,had no idea that the thermometer was at zero outside.

2197,A STORMING PARTY.,
2198,A STORMING PARTY.,
2199,A STORMING PARTY.,IT was at Stirling Castle. People who did not know might have called
2200,A STORMING PARTY.,"it the shed, but that would show their ignorance. On the ramparts was"
2201,A STORMING PARTY.,"mustered a gallant band, the flower of Scotland, armed with mangonels,"
2202,A STORMING PARTY.,"catapults, and bows and arrows; below were the English, with their"
2203,A STORMING PARTY.,"battering-rams and culverins and things. Ned was the English general,"
2204,A STORMING PARTY.,"and led the storming party, and I was his staff, and Billy was the"
2205,A STORMING PARTY.,"drummer, and drummed for the king. The Scottish general was Tom, and"
2206,A STORMING PARTY.,"he had on Susie’s plaid skirt for a kilt, and his sporran was the"
2207,A STORMING PARTY.,rocking-horse’s tail that had come off.
2208,A STORMING PARTY.,
2209,A STORMING PARTY.,"Well, there was lots of snow on the roof,—I mean the ramparts, and they"
2210,A STORMING PARTY.,"hurled it down on our heads, and we played ours was Greek fire, and"
2211,A STORMING PARTY.,"hit them back like fun, I tell you. There was quite a mountain down"
2212,A STORMING PARTY.,"below, where Andrew, the chore-man, had shovelled off the deep snow;"
2213,A STORMING PARTY.,"and we stood on this, and it was up to my waist, and I played it was"
2214,A STORMING PARTY.,"gore, because in Scott they are always wading knee-deep in gore, and I"
2215,A STORMING PARTY.,thought I would get ahead of them and go in up to my waist.
2216,A STORMING PARTY.,
2217,A STORMING PARTY.,I hit General Montrose (that was Tom) with a splendid ball of Greek
2218,A STORMING PARTY.,"fire, and it was quite soft, and a lot of it got down his neck, and"
2219,A STORMING PARTY.,"you ought to have seen him dance. He called me a dastardly Sassenach,"
2220,A STORMING PARTY.,"and I thought at first he said “sausage,” and was as mad as hops, but"
2221,A STORMING PARTY.,afterward I didn’t care.
2222,A STORMING PARTY.,
2223,A STORMING PARTY.,"Then Ned called for volunteers to storm the castle, and we all ran"
2224,A STORMING PARTY.,"to the ladder; but Ned climbed up the spout, ’cause he can shin like"
2225,A STORMING PARTY.,"sixty, and he got up before we did. He took the warder by the throat,"
2226,A STORMING PARTY.,"just like the Bold Buccleugh in “Kinmont Willie,” and chucked him"
2227,A STORMING PARTY.,right off the roo—ramparts into the gore. That made Montrose mad as a
2228,A STORMING PARTY.,"hornet, and he rushed on Ned, and they got each other round the waist,"
2229,A STORMING PARTY.,"and went all over the roof, till at last they got too near the edge,"
2230,A STORMING PARTY.,"and over they both went. Billy was scared at that and stopped drumming,"
2231,A STORMING PARTY.,"but I drew my mangonel (Susie says that isn’t the right name, but I"
2232,A STORMING PARTY.,"don’t believe she knows) and rushed on the Scottish troops, which were"
2233,A STORMING PARTY.,"only Jimmy Weaver, now that Montrose and the warder were gone. I got"
2234,A STORMING PARTY.,"Jimmy down, and put my knee on his chest and shouted, “Victory! the day"
2235,A STORMING PARTY.,is ours! Saint George for England!”
2236,A STORMING PARTY.,
2237,A STORMING PARTY.,"But then I heard somebody else yelling, and I looked over the ramparts,"
2238,A STORMING PARTY.,"and there was Montrose with his knee on Ned’s chest, waving his"
2239,A STORMING PARTY.,"culverin and shouting, “Victory! the day is ours! Saint Andrew for"
2240,A STORMING PARTY.,Scotland!”
2241,A STORMING PARTY.,
2242,A STORMING PARTY.,"I was perfectly sure that our side had beaten, and Tom was absolutely"
2243,A STORMING PARTY.,certain that he had won a great victory; but just then mother called
2244,A STORMING PARTY.,"us in to tea, so we could not fight it over again to decide. Anyhow,"
2245,A STORMING PARTY.,Montrose got so much Greek fire down his neck that he had to change
2246,A STORMING PARTY.,"everything he had on, and I didn’t have to change a thing except my"

2335,PLEASANT WALK.,
2336,PLEASANT WALK.,"“I am going to walk,” answered Miss Sophia. “Would you like to come"
2337,PLEASANT WALK.,"with me, Letty?”"
2338,PLEASANT WALK.,
2339,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Oh yes!” cried Letty, “I should like to go very much indeed! Only"
2340,PLEASANT WALK.,"wait, please, while I get my bonnet!”"
2341,PLEASANT WALK.,
2342,PLEASANT WALK.,"And Letty danced into the house, and danced out again with her brown"
2343,PLEASANT WALK.,poke bonnet over her sunny hair.
2344,PLEASANT WALK.,
2345,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Here I am, Miss Sophia!” she cried. “Now, where shall we go?”"
2346,PLEASANT WALK.,
2347,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Down the lane!” said Miss Sophia, “and through the orchard into the"
2348,PLEASANT WALK.,fields. Perhaps we may find some strawberries.”
2349,PLEASANT WALK.,
2350,PLEASANT WALK.,"So away they went, the young lady walking demurely along, while the"
2351,PLEASANT WALK.,"little girl frolicked and skipped about, now in front, now behind. It"
2352,PLEASANT WALK.,"was pretty in the green lane. The ferns were soft and plumy, and the"
2353,PLEASANT WALK.,moss firm and springy under their feet. The trees bent down and talked
2354,PLEASANT WALK.,"to the ferns, and told them stories about the birds that were building"
2355,PLEASANT WALK.,"in their branches; and the ferns had stories, too, about the black"
2356,PLEASANT WALK.,"velvet mole who lived under their roots, and who had a star on the end"
2357,PLEASANT WALK.,of his nose.
2358,PLEASANT WALK.,
2359,PLEASANT WALK.,But Letty and Miss Sophia did not hear all this; they only heard a soft
2360,PLEASANT WALK.,"whispering, and never thought what it meant."
2361,PLEASANT WALK.,
2362,PLEASANT WALK.,"Presently they came out of the lane, and passed through the orchard,"
2363,PLEASANT WALK.,"and then came out into the broad, sunny meadow."
2364,PLEASANT WALK.,
2365,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Now, Letty,” said Miss Sophia, “use your bright eyes, and see if you"
2366,PLEASANT WALK.,can find any strawberries! I will sit under a tree and rest a little.”
2367,PLEASANT WALK.,
2368,PLEASANT WALK.,"Away danced Letty, and soon she was peeping and peering under every"
2369,PLEASANT WALK.,"leaf and grass blade; but no gleam of scarlet, no pretty clusters of"
2370,PLEASANT WALK.,red and white could she see. Evidently it was not a strawberry meadow.
2371,PLEASANT WALK.,"She came back to the tree, and said,—"
2372,PLEASANT WALK.,
2373,PLEASANT WALK.,"“There are no strawberries, at all, Miss Sophia, not even one. But I"
2374,PLEASANT WALK.,have found something else. Wouldn’t you like to see it? Something very
2375,PLEASANT WALK.,pretty.”
2376,PLEASANT WALK.,
2377,PLEASANT WALK.,"“What is it, dear?” asked Miss Sophia. “A flower? I should like to see"
2378,PLEASANT WALK.,"it, certainly.”"
2379,PLEASANT WALK.,
2380,PLEASANT WALK.,"“No, it is not a flower,” said Letty; “it’s a cow.”"
2381,PLEASANT WALK.,
2382,PLEASANT WALK.,"“What?” cried Miss Sophia, springing to her feet."
2383,PLEASANT WALK.,
2384,PLEASANT WALK.,"“A cow,” said Letty, “a pretty, spotted cow. She’s coming after me, I"
2385,PLEASANT WALK.,think.”
2386,PLEASANT WALK.,
2387,PLEASANT WALK.,"Miss Sophia looked in the direction which Letty pointed, and there, to"
2388,PLEASANT WALK.,"be sure, was a cow, moving slowly toward them. She gave a shriek of"
2389,PLEASANT WALK.,"terror; then, controlling herself, she threw her arms around Letty."
2390,PLEASANT WALK.,
2391,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Be calm, my child!” she said, “I will save you! Be calm!”"
2392,PLEASANT WALK.,
2393,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Why, what is the matter, Miss Sophia?” cried Letty in alarm."
2394,PLEASANT WALK.,
2395,PLEASANT WALK.,"Miss Sophia’s face was very pale, and she trembled; but she seized"
2396,PLEASANT WALK.,"Letty’s arm, and bade her walk as fast as she could."
2397,PLEASANT WALK.,
2398,PLEASANT WALK.,"“If we should run,” she said, in a quivering voice, “it would run after"
2399,PLEASANT WALK.,"us, and then we could not possibly escape. Walk fast, my child! Don’t"
2400,PLEASANT WALK.,scream! Try to keep calm!”
2401,PLEASANT WALK.,
2402,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Why, Miss Sophia!” cried the astonished child, “you don’t think I’m"
2403,PLEASANT WALK.,"afraid of that cow, do you? Why, it’s—”"
2404,PLEASANT WALK.,
2405,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Hush! hush!” whispered Miss Sophia, dragging her along, “you will"
2406,PLEASANT WALK.,"only enrage the creature by speaking aloud. I will save you, dear, if"
2407,PLEASANT WALK.,I can! See! we are getting near the fence. Can’t you walk a little
2408,PLEASANT WALK.,faster?”
2409,PLEASANT WALK.,
2410,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Moo-oo-ooo!” said the cow, which was now following them at a quicker"

2412,PLEASANT WALK.,
2413,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Oh! oh!” cried Miss Sophia. “I shall faint, I know I shall! Letty,"
2414,PLEASANT WALK.,"don’t faint too, dear. Let one of us escape. Courage, child! Be calm!"
2415,PLEASANT WALK.,"Oh! there is the fence. Run, now, _run_ for your life!”"
2416,PLEASANT WALK.,
2417,PLEASANT WALK.,"The next minute they were both over the fence. Letty stood panting,"
2418,PLEASANT WALK.,with eyes and wide mouth open; but Miss Sophia clasped her in her arms
2419,PLEASANT WALK.,and burst into tears.
2420,PLEASANT WALK.,
2421,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Safe!” she sobbed. “My dear, dear child, we are safe!”"
2422,PLEASANT WALK.,
2423,PLEASANT WALK.,"“Yes, I suppose we are safe,” said the bewildered Letty. “But what was"
2424,PLEASANT WALK.,"the matter? It was Uncle George’s cow, and she was coming home to be"
2425,PLEASANT WALK.,milked!”
2426,PLEASANT WALK.,

2438,A GREAT DAY.,"“Yes, ma’am!” cried Bobby Wilkins, looking up with sparkling eyes."
2439,A GREAT DAY.,
2440,A GREAT DAY.,“Does any one else know?” asked Miss Mary.
2441,A GREAT DAY.,
2442,A GREAT DAY.,"No one spoke. The boy John knew very well what day it was, but he was"
2443,A GREAT DAY.,"off in the clouds, thinking of William the Conqueror, and did not hear"
2444,A GREAT DAY.,"a word Miss Mary said. Billy Green knew, too, but he had been reproved"
2445,A GREAT DAY.,"for chewing gum in class, and was in the sulks, and would not speak."
2446,A GREAT DAY.,"Of course Joe did not know, for he never knew anything of that kind;"
2447,A GREAT DAY.,and none of the girls were going to answer when the boys were reciting.
2448,A GREAT DAY.,So Bobby Wilkins was the only one who spoke.
2449,A GREAT DAY.,
2450,A GREAT DAY.,"“It is a day,” said Miss Mary, looking round rather severely, “which"
2451,A GREAT DAY.,"ought to waken joy in the heart of every American, young or old.”"
2452,A GREAT DAY.,
2453,A GREAT DAY.,"Bobby felt his cheeks glow, and his heart swell. He thought Miss Mary"
2454,A GREAT DAY.,was very kind.
2455,A GREAT DAY.,
2456,A GREAT DAY.,"“It is a day,” she went on, “to be celebrated with feelings of pride"
2457,A GREAT DAY.,and delight.”
2458,A GREAT DAY.,
2459,A GREAT DAY.,"Bobby felt of the bright new half-dollar in his pocket, and thought of"
2460,A GREAT DAY.,"the splendid kite at home, and of the cake that mother was making when"
2461,A GREAT DAY.,"he came away. He had not wanted to come to school to-day, but now he"
2462,A GREAT DAY.,was glad he had come. He had no idea that Miss Mary would feel this way
2463,A GREAT DAY.,"about it. He looked round to see how the others took it, but they all"
2464,A GREAT DAY.,"looked blank, except the boy John, who was standing on the field of"
2465,A GREAT DAY.,"Hastings, and whose countenance was illumined with the joy of victory."
2466,A GREAT DAY.,
2467,A GREAT DAY.,"“It is a day,” said Miss Mary, with kindling eyes (for the children"
2468,A GREAT DAY.,"were really very trying to-day), “which will be remembered in America"
2469,A GREAT DAY.,as long as freedom and patriotism shall endure.”
2470,A GREAT DAY.,
2471,A GREAT DAY.,Bobby felt as if he were growing taller. He saw himself in the
2472,A GREAT DAY.,"President’s chair, or mounted on a great horse, like the statues of"
2473,A GREAT DAY.,"Washington, holding out a truncheon."
2474,A GREAT DAY.,
2475,A GREAT DAY.,"“One hundred and eighteen years ago to-day,” cried Miss Mary—"
2476,A GREAT DAY.,
2477,A GREAT DAY.,"“Oh! oh my, it ain’t!” cried Bobby Wilkins, springing up. “It’s only"

2489,A GREAT DAY.,
2490,A GREAT DAY.,"Poor Bobby! Miss Mary shook her head at the children over his shoulder,"
2491,A GREAT DAY.,"as he sat in her lap, as a sign not to laugh, but I suppose they could"

2529,RICHES.,"“MAMMA,” said Mabel, “I am _very_ glad we are rich!”"
2530,RICHES.,
2531,RICHES.,Mamma looked up with a little smile; she was patching Freddy’s
2532,RICHES.,"trousers, and had just been wondering whether they would last till"
2533,RICHES.,"spring, and if not, how she was to get him another pair."
2534,RICHES.,
2535,RICHES.,"“Yes, Mabel dear,” she said. “We are very rich in some things. What"
2536,RICHES.,were you thinking about when you spoke?”
2537,RICHES.,
2538,RICHES.,"“I was thinking how dreadful it would be to be hungry,” replied Mabel,"
2539,RICHES.,"thoughtfully. “I mean terribly hungry, like people in a shipwreck. Why,"
2540,RICHES.,"just to be a little hungry, the way Freddy and I get sometimes, makes"
2541,RICHES.,"me feel all queer inside; and besides, it makes me cross and horrid. So"
2542,RICHES.,"then I wondered how it would feel to be really hungry, and not to be"
2543,RICHES.,sure that you were going to have good bread and milk for supper; and
2544,RICHES.,that made me feel so glad that we were rich.”
2545,RICHES.,
2546,RICHES.,Mamma was silent for a few minutes. She was thinking of a house to
2547,RICHES.,which she took some work the day before. She had passed through the
2548,RICHES.,"dining-room, and there, at the carved table, sat a little girl with her"
2549,RICHES.,"supper before her,—delicate rolls, and cold chicken, and raspberry jam,"
2550,RICHES.,"and hot cocoa in a china cup all covered with roses, and creamy milk in"
2551,RICHES.,a great silver mug.
2552,RICHES.,
2553,RICHES.,"The child was about Mabel’s age, but her face wore a very different"
2554,RICHES.,"expression. She had pushed her chair back, and was crying out that she"
2555,RICHES.,"would not eat cold chicken. She wouldn’t, she wouldn’t, she _wouldn’t_!"
2556,RICHES.,"so there now! The nurse might just as well take it away, and she was a"
2557,RICHES.,"horrid cross old thing! Mamma was going to have partridge for dinner,"
2558,RICHES.,"and she wanted some of that, and she would have it."
2559,RICHES.,
2560,RICHES.,"Then, when the nurse shook her white-capped head and said, “No miss!"
2561,RICHES.,"your Mamma said you were to have the chicken; so now eat it, like a"
2562,RICHES.,"good girl, and you shall have some jam,” the child flew at her like a"
2563,RICHES.,"little fury, and slapped and pinched her. That was all that Mabel’s"
2564,RICHES.,"Mamma saw, but as she thought of it, and then looked at her little"
2565,RICHES.,"maiden, with a sweet face smiling over her blue pinafore, she smiled"
2566,RICHES.,"again, very tenderly, and said,—"
2567,RICHES.,
2568,RICHES.,"“Yes, dear, it is a very good thing to be rich, if it is the right kind"
2569,RICHES.,"of riches. Go now, darling, and get the bread and milk; set the table,"
2570,RICHES.,and then call Freddy in to supper.”

2577,POVERTY.,
2578,POVERTY.,"IT was a lovely day in June, and the poor little girl was going out."
2579,POVERTY.,"She was so poor that she had to go in a great big carriage, with two"
2580,POVERTY.,"fat, slow horses and a sleepy driver, who got very angry if you asked"
2581,POVERTY.,"him to drive a little faster. She was dressed in a white frock, frilled"
2582,POVERTY.,"and flounced, and she had a fashionable little hat on her head, which"
2583,POVERTY.,"stuck up in front, so that the wind was always catching it and blowing"
2584,POVERTY.,"it off. She had tight kid gloves on her little hands, and beautiful"
2585,POVERTY.,little bronze kid boots on her feet; so you see she was very poor
2586,POVERTY.,indeed.
2587,POVERTY.,
2588,POVERTY.,"The carriage rolled slowly along through the park, and the little girl"
2589,POVERTY.,"saw many other poor children, also sitting in carriages, with tight"
2590,POVERTY.,"kid gloves and kid boots; she nodded to them, and they to her, but"
2591,POVERTY.,"it was not very interesting. By and by they left the park, and drove"
2592,POVERTY.,"out into the country, where there were green fields, with no signs to"
2593,POVERTY.,"keep people off the grass. The grass was full of buttercups, and in one"
2594,POVERTY.,"field were two little girls, running about, with their hands full of"
2595,POVERTY.,"the lovely golden blossoms, laughing and shouting to each other. One"
2596,POVERTY.,"had a pink calico dress on, and the other a brown gingham, and they"
2597,POVERTY.,"were barefooted, and their sunbonnets were lying on the grass. The poor"
2598,POVERTY.,little girl looked at them with sparkling eyes.
2599,POVERTY.,
2600,POVERTY.,"“Oh, Mademoiselle!” she cried, “may I get out and run about a little?"
2601,POVERTY.,"See what a good time those children are having! Do let me jump out,"
2602,POVERTY.,please!”
2603,POVERTY.,
2604,POVERTY.,"“_Fi donc_, Claire!” said the lady who sat beside her. She was a thin,"
2605,POVERTY.,"dark lady, with sharp, eager black eyes, and not a pleasant face. “_Fi"
2606,POVERTY.,"donc!_ What would madame, your mother, say, if she heard you desiring"
2607,POVERTY.,to run in the fields like the beggar children? Those children—dirty
2608,POVERTY.,"little wretches!—are barefooted, and it is evident that their hair"
2609,POVERTY.,"has never known the brush. Do not look at them, child! Look at the"
2610,POVERTY.,prospect!”
2611,POVERTY.,
2612,POVERTY.,“I don’t care about the prospect!” said the poor child. “I want some
2613,POVERTY.,"buttercups. We never have buttercups at our house, Mademoiselle. I wish"
2614,POVERTY.,I might pick just a few!”
2615,POVERTY.,
2616,POVERTY.,"“Assuredly not!” cried Mademoiselle, her eyes growing blacker and"
2617,POVERTY.,"sharper. “Let you leave the carriage and run about in the mire, for the"
2618,POVERTY.,"sake of a few common, vulgar flowers? Look at your dress, Claire! Look"
2619,POVERTY.,"at your delicate shoes, and your new pearl-colored gloves! Are these"
2620,POVERTY.,the things to run in the dirt with? I will not be responsible for such
2621,POVERTY.,"conduct. Sit still, and when we reach home the gardener shall pick you"
2622,POVERTY.,some roses.”
2623,POVERTY.,
2624,POVERTY.,"“I don’t want roses!” said the poor little girl, sighing wearily. “I am"
2625,POVERTY.,tired of roses. I want buttercups!”
2626,POVERTY.,
2627,POVERTY.,"She sighed again, and leaned back on the velvet cushions; the carriage"
2628,POVERTY.,rolled on. The barefoot children gazed after it with wondering eyes.
2629,POVERTY.,
2630,POVERTY.,"“My!” said one, “wasn’t she dressed fine, though!”"
2631,POVERTY.,
2632,POVERTY.,"“Yes,” said the other; “but she looked as if she was having a horrid"
2633,POVERTY.,"time, poor thing.”"
2634,POVERTY.,
2635,POVERTY.,“Poor thing!” echoed the first child.

2641,THE BEST OF ALL.,
2642,THE BEST OF ALL.,
2643,THE BEST OF ALL.,“I MEAN to have the best time this Fourth of July that I ever had in my
2644,THE BEST OF ALL.,"life,” said the Big Boy. Then all the other big boys clustered round"
2645,THE BEST OF ALL.,"him to hear what the good time was to be, and the little boy sighed"
2646,THE BEST OF ALL.,"and wished he were big, too. The big boys did not tell him what they"
2647,THE BEST OF ALL.,"were going to do, but I know all about it, so I can tell. They made a"
2648,THE BEST OF ALL.,"camp in the Big Boy’s room, which is out in the barn. One boy brought"
2649,THE BEST OF ALL.,"a comforter, and another brought a pair of blankets; and there was an"
2650,THE BEST OF ALL.,"old spring mattress up in the loft, so that with the Big Boy’s own bed,"
2651,THE BEST OF ALL.,which could hold two (if you kept very still and didn’t kick the other
2652,THE BEST OF ALL.,"fellow out), they did very well indeed. The Big Boy’s mother, knowing"
2653,THE BEST OF ALL.,"something of boys, had set out a lunch for them, crackers and cheese,"
2654,THE BEST OF ALL.,"and gingerbread and milk, so there was no danger of starvation."
2655,THE BEST OF ALL.,
2656,THE BEST OF ALL.,"Of course they were busy in the early part of the evening, buying"
2657,THE BEST OF ALL.,"their firecrackers and torpedoes, their fish-horns and all their noisy"
2658,THE BEST OF ALL.,horrors (for you must understand that this was the night before the
2659,THE BEST OF ALL.,Glorious Fourth); but by nine o’clock they were all assembled in the
2660,THE BEST OF ALL.,"barn, ready to have the very best time in the world. First they ate"
2661,THE BEST OF ALL.,"some lunch, and that was good; then they thought they would take a"
2662,THE BEST OF ALL.,"nap, just for an hour or so, that they might not be sleepy when the"
2663,THE BEST OF ALL.,"time came. Two of them lay down on the Big Boy’s bed, and two on the"
2664,THE BEST OF ALL.,"old spring mattress, and two on the floor; but it did not make much"
2665,THE BEST OF ALL.,"difference where they began their nap, for when the boys’ mother took a"
2666,THE BEST OF ALL.,"peep at them about ten o’clock, she found them all lying in a heap on"
2667,THE BEST OF ALL.,"the floor, sound asleep, though the Thin Boy was groaning in his sleep"
2668,THE BEST OF ALL.,because the Fat Boy was lying across his neck.
2669,THE BEST OF ALL.,
2670,THE BEST OF ALL.,"Suddenly the Big Boy awoke with a start, and looking at his watch,"
2671,THE BEST OF ALL.,"found that it was half past eleven. Hastily he roused the sleepers, and"
2672,THE BEST OF ALL.,"there was a hurrying and scurrying, a hunting for caps, a snatching"
2673,THE BEST OF ALL.,up of horns and slow-match. Then softly they stole down the barn
2674,THE BEST OF ALL.,"stairs, and away they went to the old church, and up they climbed into"
2675,THE BEST OF ALL.,"the belfry. The sexton had left the door unlocked, having been a boy"
2676,THE BEST OF ALL.,himself once; so there they waited till twelve o’clock came. Ah! what
2677,THE BEST OF ALL.,"a grand time they had then, “ringing the bells till they rocked the"
2678,THE BEST OF ALL.,"steeple;” but it only lasted an hour, and then there was all the rest"
2679,THE BEST OF ALL.,"of the night. They went here and they went there, and when they grew"
2680,THE BEST OF ALL.,hungry they went back to the barn and finished the lunch; and then they
2681,THE BEST OF ALL.,"tried to go to sleep again, but they kept falling about so, it was no"
2682,THE BEST OF ALL.,"use, so they waited till they thought their own houses would be open,"
2683,THE BEST OF ALL.,"and then they went home, and the Big Boy crept into his bed and slept"
2684,THE BEST OF ALL.,till noon.
2685,THE BEST OF ALL.,
2686,THE BEST OF ALL.,"But the Little Boy woke up at six o’clock, and jumped up like a lark,"
2687,THE BEST OF ALL.,"and got his torpedoes and firecrackers, and was very cheerful, though"
2688,THE BEST OF ALL.,he did sigh just once when he thought of the big boys. He turned the
2689,THE BEST OF ALL.,"gravel-sweep into a battle-field, and made forts and mines for the"
2690,THE BEST OF ALL.,"firecrackers, and then he cracked and snapped and fizzed and blazed—at"
2691,THE BEST OF ALL.,least the firecrackers did—all the morning. He only burned his fingers
2692,THE BEST OF ALL.,"twice and his trousers five times, and that was doing very well. He"
2693,THE BEST OF ALL.,had a glorious day; and his mother thought—but neither the Little Boy
2694,THE BEST OF ALL.,nor the Big Boy agreed with her—that the best part of all was the good
2695,THE BEST OF ALL.,night’s sleep beforehand.

2750,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2751,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"THE young ladies had a reception this afternoon, and a charming"
2752,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"occasion it was. The guests were invited for four o’clock, and when I"
2753,THE YOUNG LADIES.,came in at five the party was in full swing.
2754,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2755,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"Clare was the hostess,—lovely Clare, with her innocent blue eyes and"
2756,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"gentle, unchanging smile. The nursery was transformed into a bower of"
2757,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"beauty, and Clare was standing by a chair, holding out her hand with a"
2758,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"gracious gesture of welcome. Alida received with her, and she looked"
2759,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"charming, too, only she was so much smaller that she had to be stood"
2760,THE YOUNG LADIES.,up on a box to bring her to a level with Clare’s shoulder. Alida is a
2761,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"remarkable doll, because she can open and shut her eyes without lying"
2762,THE YOUNG LADIES.,down or getting up; and Betty sat on the floor behind her and pulled
2763,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"the strings, so that she waved her long eyelashes up and down in the"
2764,THE YOUNG LADIES.,most enchanting manner.
2765,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2766,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"All the dolls were in their best clothes, except Jack the sailor, who"
2767,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"cannot change his suit, because it is against his principles; and I"
2768,THE YOUNG LADIES.,must say they made a pretty party. The tea-things were set out on the
2769,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"little round table, all the best cups and saucers, and the pewter"
2770,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"teapot that came from Holland, and the gold spoons; and there was _real"
2771,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"cocoa_, and jam, and oyster crackers, and thin bread and butter."
2772,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2773,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"Rosalie Urania presided at the tea-table, and poured the cocoa with"
2774,THE YOUNG LADIES.,such grace that no one would have suspected her of being helped a
2775,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"little by Juliet (Juliet is not a doll), who was hidden behind the"
2776,THE YOUNG LADIES.,table.
2777,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2778,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"“Will you have a cup of cocoa?” asked Rosalie, sweetly, as Mr."
2779,THE YOUNG LADIES.,Punchinello approached her with his most elegant bow.
2780,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2781,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"“With pleasure, lovely maiden!” was the courtly reply. “From your hands"
2782,THE YOUNG LADIES.,what would not your devoted Punchinello take?”
2783,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2784,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"He bowed and smiled again (indeed, he was always smiling), while"
2785,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"Rosalie, blushing (it was a way she had), lifted the pewter teapot, and"
2786,THE YOUNG LADIES.,deftly filled one of the pretty cups.
2787,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2788,THE YOUNG LADIES.,“He’ll take a licking from my hands if he doesn’t look out!” growled
2789,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"Jack, the sailor, who is jealous of Punchinello, and loves Rosalie"
2790,THE YOUNG LADIES.,Urania.
2791,THE YOUNG LADIES.,
2792,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"“Hush, you rude creature!” whispered Alida, giving Jack a little push."
2793,THE YOUNG LADIES.,Clare is quite sure that Alida only meant the push as a gentle rebuke
2794,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"to Jack, and a warning to keep quiet, and not let his angry passions"
2795,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"rise; but Clare always stands up for Alida. However it was, Jack"
2796,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"tottered, staggered forward, and fell against Mr. Punchinello, knocking"
2797,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"that smiling gentleman over on the table, and upsetting the teapot all"
2798,THE YOUNG LADIES.,over Rosalie Urania’s pink silk gown. Such a confusion as arose then!
2799,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"Rosalie fainted, of course. Jack picked himself up, and looked black as"
2800,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"thunder. Alida shut her eyes, and kept them shut (she said it was from"
2801,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"horror, but it may have been because Betty forgot to pull the opening"
2802,THE YOUNG LADIES.,"string), but Clare and Mr. Punchinello did nothing but smile, which was"
2803,THE YOUNG LADIES.,a proof of their exquisite breeding.

2959,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2960,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“MOTHER,” said Roger, swinging in at the door and catching up the baby"
2961,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"for a toss, “I am going to begin Physical Geography! And teacher says"
2962,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"I must have a book, please, as soon as I can get it. It costs two"
2963,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"dollars, and it’s just _full_ of pictures, oh, _so_ interesting! And"
2964,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"may I get it to-day, please, mother?”"
2965,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2966,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Mother” looked up with a sad little loving smile. “Dear heart,” she"
2967,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"said, “I have not two dollars in the world just now, unless I take them"
2968,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"from the money I am saving for your new suit, and I hardly ought to do"
2969,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"that, my poor Roger!”"
2970,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2971,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Roger looked down with a rueful whistle at his clothes, which, though"
2972,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"clean, were patched and darned to the utmost limit."
2973,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2974,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,“I’m afraid the Patent Mosaic Suit _is_ rather past the bloom of
2975,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"youth,” he said, cheerily. “Never mind, mammy! Perhaps Will Almy will"
2976,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"lend me his book, sometimes, or I can study in recess out of Miss"
2977,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Black’s. Don’t worry, anyhow, but catch Miss Dumpling here, while I go"
2978,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,and bring in some water.”
2979,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2980,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Mrs. Rayne sighed deeply, as Roger set the baby on her lap and darted"
2981,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,out of the house. She knew it was to hide his face of disappointment
2982,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,that the boy had gone off so hurriedly.
2983,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2984,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Poor Roger! so bright, so eager to learn, he ought to have a first-rate"
2985,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"education! But how could she, a widow with four children on a tiny"
2986,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"farm, give it to him? Bread and butter and decent clothing must come"
2987,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"first, and these were hard enough to win, even though she worked all"
2988,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,day and half the night for them. Education must be picked up as it
2989,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,could.
2990,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2991,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"The little woman shook her head and sighed again, as she put Miss"
2992,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Dumpling on the floor with a button-string to play with, and took up"
2993,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,the pile of mending.
2994,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2995,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"But Roger, though he was disappointed, had no idea of giving up the"
2996,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,Physical Geography. Not a bit of it!
2997,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
2998,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Mother cannot get it for me,” he said, as he turned away at the"
2999,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"windlass of the old well. “Very well, then, I must get it myself. The"
3000,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"only question is, how?”"
3001,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3002,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Up came the brimming bucket, and, as he stooped to lift it, he saw"
3003,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"in the clear water the reflection of a bright, anxious face, with"
3004,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"inquiring eyes and a resolute mouth. “Don’t be afraid, old fellow!” he"
3005,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"said, with a reassuring nod. “‘How?’ is a short question, and I am sure"
3006,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"to find the answer before the day is out,” and, whistling merrily, he"
3007,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,went off to water the garden.
3008,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3009,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"That evening, just as the sun was sinking, all golden and glorious"
3010,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"beneath the horizon, a boat pushed out from among the reeds that"
3011,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,fringed Pleasant Pond. It was a rough little dory of no particular
3012,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"model, painted a dingy green, but its crew was apparently well"
3013,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,satisfied with it. One boy sat in the stern and paddled sturdily:
3014,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"another crouched in the bow, scanning the reeds with a critical air,"
3015,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"while between them sat a little fair-haired maiden, leaning over the"
3016,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"side and singing, as she dipped her hands in the clear, dark water."
3017,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3018,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Here’s a fine bunch of cat-tails!” cried Roger. “Shove her in here,"
3019,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,Joe!”
3020,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3021,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Joe obeyed, and Roger’s knife was soon at work cutting the stately"
3022,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"reeds, with their sceptre-tips of firm, brown velvet."
3023,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3024,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Oh, and here are the lilies!” cried little Annet. “See, Roger! see!"
3025,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"all white and gold, the lovely things! Oh, let me pull them!”"
3026,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3027,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"In another moment, the boat seemed to be resting on a living carpet of"
3028,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,snow and gold. The lilies grew so thick that one could hardly see the
3029,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"water between them. Roger and Annet drew them in by handfuls, laying"
3030,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"them in glistening piles in the bottom of the boat, and soon Joe laid"
3031,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"down his paddle, and joined in the picking."
3032,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3033,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Some pooty, be n’t they?” he said. “What d’ye cal’late ter sell ’em"
3034,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"for, Roger?”"
3035,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3036,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“For whatever I can get,” replied Roger, cheerfully. “I’ve never tried"
3037,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"it before, but I know that plenty of boys do take them to the city from"
3038,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"other ponds and streams. We are a little farther off, but I never saw"
3039,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,any lilies so large as ours.”
3040,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3041,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Nor so sweet!” cried Annet, burying her rosy face in the golden heart"
3042,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"of a snowy cup. “Oh, how I love them!”"
3043,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3044,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,How the lilies must have wondered at the adventures that befell them
3045,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"after this! All night they lay in a great tub of water, which was well"
3046,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"enough, though there was no mud in it. Then, at daybreak next morning"
3047,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,they were taken out and laid on a bed of wet moss and covered with wet
3048,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"burdock leaves. Then came a long period of jolting, when the world went"
3049,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"bumping up and down with a noise of creaking and rumbling, broken by"
3050,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,the sound of human voices.
3051,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3052,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Finally, and suddenly, they emerged into the full glare of the sun,"
3053,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"and found themselves in a new world altogether,—a street corner in a"
3054,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"great city; tall buildings, glittering windows, crowds of men and women"
3055,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"hurrying to and fro like ants about an ant-hill. Only the cool, wet"
3056,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"moss beneath them, and the sight of their old friends, the cat-tails,"
3057,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"standing like sentinels beside them, kept the lilies from fainting away"
3058,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,altogether.
3059,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3060,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Roger looked eagerly about him, scanning the faces of the passers-by."
3061,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Would this one buy? or that one? that pretty lady, who looked like a"
3062,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"lily herself? He held out a bunch timidly, and the lady smiled and"
3063,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,stopped.
3064,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3065,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,“How lovely and fresh! Thank you!” and the first piece of silver
3066,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"dropped into Roger’s pocket, and chinked merrily against his"
3067,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,jackknife. Then another young lady carried off a huge bunch of
3068,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"cat-tails, and a second piece of silver jingled against the first."
3069,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3070,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Soon another followed it, and another, and another, and Roger’s eyes"
3071,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"danced, and his hopes rose higher and higher."
3072,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3073,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"At this rate, the Physical Geography would be his, beyond a doubt. He"
3074,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"saw it already,—the smooth green covers, the delightful maps within,"
3075,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"the pictures of tropical countries, of monkeys and cocoanuts, elephants"
3076,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,and—THUMP! His dream was rudely broken in upon by a gentleman running
3077,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"against him and nearly knocking him over,—an old gentleman, with"
3078,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"fierce, twinkling eyes and a bushy gray beard."
3079,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3080,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“What! what!” sputtered the old gentleman, pettishly. “Get out of my"
3081,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"way, boy! My fault! beg your pardon!” Roger moved aside, bewildered by"
3082,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,the sudden shock.
3083,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3084,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Will you buy some Physical Geographies, sir?” he asked. “See how fresh"
3085,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,they are? They are the loveliest—”
3086,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3087,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“This boy is a lunatic!” said the old gentleman, fiercely, “and ought"
3088,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"to be shut up. How dare you talk to me about Physical Geography, sir?”"
3089,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3090,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Roger stared at him blankly, and then grew crimson with shame and"
3091,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"confusion. “I—I beg your pardon, sir!” he faltered, “I _meant_ to say"
3092,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,‘lilies.’ I was thinking so hard about the geography that it slipped
3093,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,out without my knowing it. I suppose. I—”
3094,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3095,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“What! what!” cried the old gentleman, catching him by his arm."
3096,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Thinking about Physical Geography, hey? What d’ye mean? This is a"
3097,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"remarkable boy. Come here, sir! come here!”"
3098,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3099,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"He dragged Roger to one side, and made him sit down beside him on"
3100,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"a convenient doorstep. “What d’ye mean?” he repeated, fixing his"
3101,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,piercing gray eyes upon the boy in a manner which made him feel very
3102,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,uncomfortable. “What do you know about Physical Geography?”
3103,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3104,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“Nothing yet, sir,” replied Roger, modestly. “But I am very anxious to"
3105,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"study it, and I am selling these lilies and cat-tails to try and get"
3106,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,money enough to buy the book.”
3107,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3108,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,“This is a _most_ remarkable boy!” cried the old gentleman. “What
3109,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"geography is it you want, hey? Merton’s, I’ll warrant. Trash, sir!"
3110,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,unspeakable trash!”
3111,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3112,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“No, sir; Willison’s,” replied the boy, thinking that the old gentleman"
3113,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,was certainly crazy.
3114,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3115,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"But on hearing this, his strange companion seized him by the hand, and"
3116,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,shook it warmly. “I am Willison!” he exclaimed. “It is my Geography!
3117,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,You are a singularly intelligent boy. I am glad to meet you.”
3118,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3119,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,Roger stared in blank wonderment. “Did—did you write the Physical
3120,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"Geography, sir?” he stammered, finally."
3121,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3122,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“To be sure I did!” said the old gentleman, “and a good job it was!"
3123,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"While that ass Merton,—here! here!” he cried, fumbling in his pockets,"
3124,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“give me the lilies, and take that!” and he thrust a shining silver"
3125,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"dollar into Roger’s hand. “And here!” he scribbled something on a card,"
3126,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"“take that, and go to Cooper, the publisher, and see what he says to"
3127,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,you. You are an astonishing boy! Good-by! God bless you! You have done
3128,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"me good. I was suffering from dyspepsia when I met you,—atrocious"
3129,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,tortures! All gone now! Bless you!”
3130,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3131,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"He was gone, and Roger Rayne was sitting alone on the steps, with the"
3132,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"dollar in one hand, and the card in the other, as bewildered a boy as"
3133,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,any in Boston town.
3134,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,
3135,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"When he recovered his senses a little, he looked at the card and read,"
3136,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"in breezy, straggling letters, “Give to the astonishing boy who brings"
3137,LILIES AND CAT-TAILS.,"this, a copy of my Physical Geography. Best binding. William Willison.”"

3281,THE SPECKLED HEN.,THE SPECKLED HEN.
3282,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3283,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3284,THE SPECKLED HEN.,THERE was once a hen with brown speckled wings and a short black tail.
3285,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"She stood in a shop window, on a bit of wood covered with green baize,"
3286,THE SPECKLED HEN.,and kept watch over the eggs with which the window was filled.
3287,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3288,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“I may be stuffed,” said the hen, “but I hope I know my duty for all"
3289,THE SPECKLED HEN.,that!”
3290,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3291,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"There were many eggs, and some of them were very different from the"
3292,THE SPECKLED HEN.,eggs to which she had been accustomed; but she did not see what she
3293,THE SPECKLED HEN.,could do about that.
3294,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3295,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Their mothers must be people of very vulgar tastes,” she said, “or"
3296,THE SPECKLED HEN.,else fashions have changed sadly. In my day a hen who laid red or blue
3297,THE SPECKLED HEN.,or green eggs would have been chased out of the barnyard; but the world
3298,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"has gone steadily backward since then, I have reason to think.”"
3299,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3300,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"She was silent, and fixed her eyes on a large white egg which had been"
3301,THE SPECKLED HEN.,recently placed in the window.
3302,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3303,THE SPECKLED HEN.,There was something strange about that egg. She had never seen one like
3304,THE SPECKLED HEN.,it. No hen that ever lived could lay such a monstrous thing; even a
3305,THE SPECKLED HEN.,turkey could not produce one of half the size.
3306,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3307,THE SPECKLED HEN.,Whence could it have come? She remembered stories that she had
3308,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"heard, when a pullet, of huge birds as tall as the hen-house, called"
3309,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"ostriches. Could this be an ostrich egg? If it was, she could not"
3310,THE SPECKLED HEN.,possibly be expected to take care of the chick.
3311,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3312,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“The idea!” she said. “Why, it will be as big as I am!”"
3313,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3314,THE SPECKLED HEN.,At this moment a hand appeared in the window. It was the shopkeeper’s
3315,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"hand, and it set down before the hen an object which filled her with"
3316,THE SPECKLED HEN.,amazement and consternation.
3317,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3318,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"It _looked_ like an egg: that is, it was shaped and coloured like"
3319,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"an egg; but from the top, which was broken, protruded a head which"
3320,THE SPECKLED HEN.,certainly was not that of a chicken.
3321,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3322,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"The head wore a black hat; it had a round, rosy face, something like"
3323,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"the shopkeeper’s, and what could be seen of the shoulders was clad in a"
3324,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"bottle-green coat, with a bright-red cravat tied under the pink chin."
3325,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3326,THE SPECKLED HEN.,The little black eyes met the hen’s troubled glance with a bright and
3327,THE SPECKLED HEN.,cheerful look.
3328,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3329,THE SPECKLED HEN.,“Good-morning!” said the creature. “It’s a fine day!”
3330,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3331,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“What are you?” asked the hen, rather sternly. “I don’t approve of your"
3332,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"appearance at all. Do you call yourself a chicken, pray?”"
3333,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3334,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Why, no,” said the thing, looking down at itself. “I—I am a man, I"
3335,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"think. Eh? I have a hat, you see.”"
3336,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3337,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“No, you are not!” cried the hen, in some excitement. “Men don’t come"
3338,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"out of eggs. You _ought_ to be a chicken, but there is some mistake"
3339,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"somewhere. Can’t you get back into your shell, and—a—change your"
3340,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"clothes, or do _something_?”"
3341,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3342,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“I’m afraid not,” said the little man (for he _was_ a man). “I don’t"
3343,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"seem to be able to move much; and besides, I don’t think I was meant"
3344,THE SPECKLED HEN.,for a chicken. I don’t _feel_ like a chicken.”
3345,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3346,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Oh, but look at your shell!” cried the poor hen. “Consider the example"
3347,THE SPECKLED HEN.,you are setting to all these eggs! There’s no knowing _what_ they will
3348,THE SPECKLED HEN.,hatch into if they see this sort of thing going on. I will lend you
3349,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"some feathers,” she added, coaxingly, “and perhaps I can scratch round"
3350,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"and find you a worm, though my legs are pretty stiff. Come, be a good"
3351,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"chicken, and get back into your shell!”"
3352,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3353,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“I don’t like worms,” said the little man, decidedly. “And I am _not_"
3354,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"a chicken, I tell you. Did you ever see a chicken with a hat on?”"
3355,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3356,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“N—no,” replied the hen, doubtfully, “I don’t think I ever did.”"
3357,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3358,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Well, then!” said the little man, triumphantly."
3359,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3360,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"And the hen was silent, for one cannot argue well when one is stuffed."
3361,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3362,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"The little man now looked about him in a leisurely way, and presently"
3363,THE SPECKLED HEN.,his eyes fell on the great white egg.
3364,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3365,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Is that _your_ egg?” he asked, politely."
3366,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3367,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"The hen appreciated the compliment, but replied, rather sadly, “No,"
3368,THE SPECKLED HEN.,it is not. I do not even know whose egg it is. I expect to watch over
3369,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"the eggs in a general way, and I hope I know my duty; but I really do"
3370,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"not feel as if I _could_ manage a chicken of that size. Besides,” she"
3371,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"added, with a glance at the black hat and the bottle-green coat, “how"
3372,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"do I know that it will be a chicken? It may hatch out a—a—sea-serpent,"
3373,THE SPECKLED HEN.,for aught I know.”
3374,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3375,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Would you like to make sure?” asked the little man, who really had a"
3376,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"kind heart, and would have been a chicken if he could. “There seems to"
3377,THE SPECKLED HEN.,be a crack where this ribbon is tied on. Shall I peep through and see
3378,THE SPECKLED HEN.,what is inside?”
3379,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3380,THE SPECKLED HEN.,“I shall be truly grateful if you will!” cried the hen. “I assure you
3381,THE SPECKLED HEN.,it weighs upon my mind.”
3382,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3383,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"The little man leaned over against the great white egg, and took a long"
3384,THE SPECKLED HEN.,look through the crack.
3385,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3386,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“Compose yourself!” he said, at last, looking at the hen with an"
3387,THE SPECKLED HEN.,anxious expression. “I fear this will be a blow to you. There are five
3388,THE SPECKLED HEN.,white rabbits inside this egg!”
3389,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3390,THE SPECKLED HEN.,The speckled hen rolled her glass eyes wildly about and tried to
3391,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"cackle, but in vain."
3392,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3393,THE SPECKLED HEN.,“This is too much!” she said. “This is more than I can bear. Tell
3394,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"the shopkeeper that he must get some one else to mind his eggs, for a"
3395,THE SPECKLED HEN.,barnyard where the eggs hatch into rabbits is no place for me.”
3396,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3397,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"And with one despairing cluck, the hen fell off the bit of wood and lay"
3398,THE SPECKLED HEN.,at full length on the shelf.
3399,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3400,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"“It is a pity for people to be sensitive,” said the little man to"
3401,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"himself, as he surveyed her lifeless body. “Why are not five rabbits as"
3402,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"good as one chicken, I should like to know? After all, it is only a man"
3403,THE SPECKLED HEN.,who can understand these matters.”
3404,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3405,THE SPECKLED HEN.,"And he cocked his black hat, and settled his red necktie, and thought"
3406,THE SPECKLED HEN.,very well of himself.
3407,THE SPECKLED HEN.,
3408,THE SPECKLED HEN.,

3411,THE MONEY SHOP.,THE MONEY SHOP.
3412,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3413,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3414,THE MONEY SHOP.,"JACK RUSSELL was five years old and ten days over; therefore, it"
3415,THE MONEY SHOP.,"is plain that he was now a big boy. He had left off kilts, and his"
3416,THE MONEY SHOP.,"trousers had as many buttons as it is possible for trousers to have,"
3417,THE MONEY SHOP.,and his boots had a noble squeak in them. What would you have more?
3418,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3419,THE MONEY SHOP.,"This being the case, of course Jack could go down town with his Mamma"
3420,THE MONEY SHOP.,"when she went shopping, a thing that little boys cannot do, as a rule."
3421,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3422,THE MONEY SHOP.,"One day in Christmas week, when all the shops were full of pretty"
3423,THE MONEY SHOP.,"things, Jack and his Mamma found themselves in the gay street, with"
3424,THE MONEY SHOP.,"crowds of people hurrying to and fro, all carrying parcels of every"
3425,THE MONEY SHOP.,imaginable shape.
3426,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3427,THE MONEY SHOP.,"The air was crisp and tingling, the sleigh-bells made a merry din, and"
3428,THE MONEY SHOP.,"everybody looked cheerful and smiling, as if they knew that Christmas"
3429,THE MONEY SHOP.,was only five days off.
3430,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3431,THE MONEY SHOP.,"_Almost_ everybody, for as Jack stopped to look in at a shop window, he"
3432,THE MONEY SHOP.,"saw some one who did not look cheerful. It was a poor woman, thinly and"
3433,THE MONEY SHOP.,"miserably clad, and holding a little boy by the hand."
3434,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3435,THE MONEY SHOP.,"The boy was _little_, because he wore petticoats (oh, such poor, ragged"
3436,THE MONEY SHOP.,petticoats)! but he was taller than Jack. He was looking longingly at
3437,THE MONEY SHOP.,the toys in the window.
3438,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3439,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Oh, mother!” he cried, “see that little horse! Oh, I wish I had a"
3440,THE MONEY SHOP.,little horse!”
3441,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3442,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“My dear,” said the poor woman, sighing, “if I can give you an apple to"
3443,THE MONEY SHOP.,"eat with your bread on Christmas Day, you must be thankful, for I can"
3444,THE MONEY SHOP.,do no more. Poor people can’t have pretty things like those.”
3445,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3446,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Come, Jack!” said Mrs. Russell, drawing him on hastily. “What are you"
3447,THE MONEY SHOP.,"stopping for, child?”"
3448,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3449,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Mamma,” asked Jack, trudging along stoutly, but looking grave and"
3450,THE MONEY SHOP.,"perplexed, “why can’t poor people have nice things?”"
3451,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3452,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Why? Oh!” said Mrs. Russell, who had not noticed the poor woman and"
3453,THE MONEY SHOP.,"her boy, “because they have no money to buy them. Pretty things cost"
3454,THE MONEY SHOP.,"money, you know.”"
3455,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3456,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Jack thought this over a little in his own way; then, “But, Mamma,” he"
3457,THE MONEY SHOP.,"said, “why don’t they buy some money at the money shop?”"
3458,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3459,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Mrs. Russell only laughed at this, and patted Jack’s head and called"
3460,THE MONEY SHOP.,"him a “little goose,” and then they went into a large shop and bought a"
3461,THE MONEY SHOP.,beautiful wax doll for Sissy.
3462,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3463,THE MONEY SHOP.,"But Jack’s mind was still at work, and while they were waiting for the"
3464,THE MONEY SHOP.,flaxen-haired beauty to be wrapped in white tissue paper and put in a
3465,THE MONEY SHOP.,"box, he pursued his inquiries."
3466,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3467,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Where do you get your money, Mamma dear?”"
3468,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3469,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Why, your dear Papa gives me my money, Jacky boy. Didn’t you see him"
3470,THE MONEY SHOP.,give me all those nice crisp bills this morning?”
3471,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3472,THE MONEY SHOP.,“And where does my Papa get _his_ money?”
3473,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3474,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Oh, child, how you _do_ ask questions! He gets it at the bank.”"
3475,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3476,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Then is the bank the money shop, Mamma?”"
3477,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3478,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Mrs. Russell laughed absent-mindedly, for, in truth, her thoughts were"
3479,THE MONEY SHOP.,"on other things, and she was only half-listening to the child, which"
3480,THE MONEY SHOP.,"was a pity. “Yes, dear,” she said, “it is the only money shop I know"
3481,THE MONEY SHOP.,"of. Now you must not ask me any more questions, Jack. You distract me!”"
3482,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3483,THE MONEY SHOP.,But Jack had no more questions to ask.
3484,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3485,THE MONEY SHOP.,"The next day, as the cashier at the National Bank was busily adding up"
3486,THE MONEY SHOP.,"an endless column of figures, he was startled by hearing a voice which"
3487,THE MONEY SHOP.,apparently came from nowhere.
3488,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3489,THE MONEY SHOP.,"No face appeared at the little window in the gilded grating, and yet a"
3490,THE MONEY SHOP.,"sweet, silvery voice was certainly saying, with great distinctness, “If"
3491,THE MONEY SHOP.,"you please, I should like to buy some money.”"
3492,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3493,THE MONEY SHOP.,"He looked through the window and saw a small boy, carrying a bundle"
3494,THE MONEY SHOP.,almost as big as himself.
3495,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3496,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“What can I do for you, my little man?” asked the cashier kindly."
3497,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3498,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“I should like to buy some money, please,” repeated Jack, very politely."
3499,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3500,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Oh, indeed!” said the cashier, with a twinkle in his eye. “And how"
3501,THE MONEY SHOP.,"much money would you like, sir?”"
3502,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3503,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“About a fousand dollars, I fink,” said Jack, promptly. (It does"
3504,THE MONEY SHOP.,"sometimes happen that big boys cannot pronounce “th” distinctly, but"
3505,THE MONEY SHOP.,they are none the less big for that.)
3506,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3507,THE MONEY SHOP.,“A thousand dollars!” repeated the cashier. “That’s a good deal of
3508,THE MONEY SHOP.,"money, young gentleman!”"
3509,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3510,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“I know it,” said Jack. “I wants a good deal. I have brought some"
3511,THE MONEY SHOP.,"fings to pay for it,” he added, confidentially; and opening the big"
3512,THE MONEY SHOP.,"bundle with great pride, he displayed to the astonished official a"
3513,THE MONEY SHOP.,"hobby-horse, a drum (nearly new), a set of building blocks and a"
3514,THE MONEY SHOP.,paint-box.
3515,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3516,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“It’s a _very_ good hobby-horse,” he said, proudly. “It has real hair,"
3517,THE MONEY SHOP.,and he will go _just_ as fast as—as you can _make_ him go.”
3518,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3519,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Here the cashier turned red in the face, coughed and disappeared."
3520,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Perhaps he is having a fit, like the yellow kitten,” said Jack to"
3521,THE MONEY SHOP.,"himself, calmly; and he waited with cheerful patience till he should"
3522,THE MONEY SHOP.,get his money.
3523,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3524,THE MONEY SHOP.,"In a few moments the cashier returned, and taking him by the hand, led"
3525,THE MONEY SHOP.,"him kindly into a back room, where three gentlemen were sitting."
3526,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3527,THE MONEY SHOP.,"They all had gray hair, and two of them wore gold-bowed spectacles; but"
3528,THE MONEY SHOP.,"they looked kind, and one of them beckoned Jack to come to him."
3529,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3530,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“What is all this, my little lad?” he asked. “Did any one send you here"
3531,THE MONEY SHOP.,to get money?”
3532,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3533,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Jack shook his head stoutly. “No,” he said, “I comed myself; but I am"
3534,THE MONEY SHOP.,not little. I stopped being little when I had trousers.”
3535,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3536,THE MONEY SHOP.,“I see!” said the gentleman. “Of course. But what made you think you
3537,THE MONEY SHOP.,could get money here?”
3538,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3539,THE MONEY SHOP.,The blue eyes opened wide.
3540,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3541,THE MONEY SHOP.,“Mamma said that Papa got his money here; and I asked her if this was a
3542,THE MONEY SHOP.,"money shop, and she said it was the only money shop she knowed of. So I"
3543,THE MONEY SHOP.,comed.”
3544,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3545,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Just so,” said the kind gentleman, stroking the curly head before him."
3546,THE MONEY SHOP.,“And you brought these things to pay for the money?”
3547,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3548,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“Yes,” said Jack, cheerfully. “’Cause you buy fings with money, you"
3549,THE MONEY SHOP.,"see, so I s’pose you buy money with fings.”"
3550,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3551,THE MONEY SHOP.,“And what did you mean to do with a thousand dollars?” asked the
3552,THE MONEY SHOP.,"gentleman. “Buy candy, eh?”"
3553,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3554,THE MONEY SHOP.,Then Jack looked up into the gentle gray eyes and told his little story
3555,THE MONEY SHOP.,about the poor woman whom he had seen the day before. “She was so
3556,THE MONEY SHOP.,"poor,” he said, “her little boy could not have any Christmas _at all_,"
3557,THE MONEY SHOP.,"only an apple and some bread, and I’m sure _that_ isn’t Christmas. And"
3558,THE MONEY SHOP.,"she hadn’t _any_ money, not any at all. So I fought I would buy her"
3559,THE MONEY SHOP.,"some, and then she could get _everything_ she wanted.”"
3560,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3561,THE MONEY SHOP.,By this time the two other gentlemen had their hands in their pockets;
3562,THE MONEY SHOP.,"but the first one motioned them to wait, and taking the little boy on"
3563,THE MONEY SHOP.,"his knee, he told him in a few simple words what a bank really was, and"
3564,THE MONEY SHOP.,why one could not buy money there.
3565,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3566,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“But you see, dear,” he added, seeing the disappointment in the child’s"
3567,THE MONEY SHOP.,"face, “you have here in your hands the very things that poor woman"
3568,THE MONEY SHOP.,would like to buy for her little boy. Give her the fine hobby-horse and
3569,THE MONEY SHOP.,"the drum and the paint-box, too, if you like, and she can give him the"
3570,THE MONEY SHOP.,finest Christmas that ever a poor boy had.”
3571,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3572,THE MONEY SHOP.,"Jack’s face lighted up again, and a smile flashed through the tears"
3573,THE MONEY SHOP.,"that stood in his sweet blue eyes. “I never fought of that!” he cried,"
3574,THE MONEY SHOP.,joyfully.
3575,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3576,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“And,” continued the old gentleman, drawing a gold piece from his"
3577,THE MONEY SHOP.,"pocket and putting it in the little chubby hand, “you may give that to"
3578,THE MONEY SHOP.,the poor woman to buy a turkey with.”
3579,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3580,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“And that,” cried the second old gentleman, putting another gold piece"
3581,THE MONEY SHOP.,"on top of it, “to buy mince-pies with.”"
3582,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3583,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“And that,” cried the third old gentleman, while a third gold piece"
3584,THE MONEY SHOP.,"clinked on the other two, “to buy a plum-pudding with.”"
3585,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3586,THE MONEY SHOP.,"“And God bless you, my dear little boy!” said the first gentleman, “and"
3587,THE MONEY SHOP.,"may you always keep your loving heart, and never want a piece of money"
3588,THE MONEY SHOP.,to make Christmas for the poor.”
3589,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3590,THE MONEY SHOP.,Little Jack looked from one to the other with radiant eyes. “You are
3591,THE MONEY SHOP.,"_very_ good shopkeepers,” he said. “I love you all _very_ much. I"
3592,THE MONEY SHOP.,"should like to kiss you all, please.”"
3593,THE MONEY SHOP.,
3594,THE MONEY SHOP.,And none of those three old gentlemen had ever had so sweet a kiss in
3595,THE MONEY SHOP.,his life.

3601,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3602,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3603,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"“WHAT _shall_ I do all this long afternoon?” cried Will, yawning and"
3604,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"stretching himself. “What—shall—I—do? A whole long afternoon, and the"
3605,A LONG AFTERNOON.,rain pouring and nothing to do. It will seem like a whole week till
3606,A LONG AFTERNOON.,supper time. I know it will. Oh—_dear_—me!”
3607,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3608,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"“It _is_ too bad!” said Aunt Harriet, sympathetically. “Poor lad! What"
3609,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"will you do, indeed? While you are waiting, suppose you just hold this"
3610,A LONG AFTERNOON.,yarn for me.”
3611,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3612,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"Will held six skeins of yarn, one after another; and Aunt Harriet told"
3613,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"him six stories, one after the other, each better than the last."
3614,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3615,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"He was sorry when the yarn was all wound, and he began to wonder again"
3616,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"what he should do all the long, long afternoon."
3617,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3618,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"“Will,” said his mother, calling him over the balusters, “I wish you"
3619,A LONG AFTERNOON.,would stay with baby just a few minutes while I run down to the kitchen
3620,A LONG AFTERNOON.,to see about something.”
3621,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3622,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"Will ran up, and his mother ran down. She was gone an hour, but he did"
3623,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"not think it was more than ten minutes, for he and baby were having a"
3624,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"great time, playing that the big woolly ball was a tiger, and that they"
3625,A LONG AFTERNOON.,were elephants chasing it through the jungle.
3626,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3627,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"Will blew a horn, because it spoke in the “Swiss Family Robinson” of"
3628,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"the elephants’ trumpeting; and baby blew a tin whistle, which was a"
3629,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"rattle, too; and the tiger blew nothing at all, because tigers do not"
3630,A LONG AFTERNOON.,trumpet.
3631,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3632,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"It was a glorious game; but when Mamma came back, Will’s face fell, and"
3633,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"he stopped trumpeting, because he knew it would tire Mamma’s head."
3634,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3635,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"“Dear Mamma!” he said, “what _shall_ I do this long, long afternoon,"
3636,A LONG AFTERNOON.,with the rain pouring and nothing to do?”
3637,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3638,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"His mother took him by the shoulders, gave him a shake and then a kiss,"
3639,A LONG AFTERNOON.,and turned him round toward the window.
3640,A LONG AFTERNOON.,
3641,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"“Look there, goosey!” she cried, laughing. “It stopped raining half an"
3642,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"hour ago, and now the sun is setting bright and clear. It is nearly six"
3643,A LONG AFTERNOON.,"o’clock, and you have just precisely time enough to run and post this"

3654,THE JACKET.,
3655,THE JACKET.,"“I bought the cloth, little Master mine,"
3656,THE JACKET.,"From the merchant who sells it, coarse and fine."
3657,THE JACKET.,"I cut it out with my shears so bright,"
3658,THE JACKET.,And with needle and thread I sewed it tight.”

3662,THE JACKET.,
3663,THE JACKET.,"“The cloth was made, little Master mine,"

3665,THE JACKET.,The weaver wove them together for me;

3672,THE JACKET.,The spinner carded the wool so fine.
3673,THE JACKET.,"She spun it in threads, and brought it to me,"

3675,THE JACKET.,
3676,THE JACKET.,"“Spinner, spinner, tell me true,"

3680,THE JACKET.,The farmer he cut it and washed it clear;
3681,THE JACKET.,"The dyer dyed it so bright and blue,"
3682,THE JACKET.,And brought it to me to spin for you.”
3683,THE JACKET.,
3684,THE JACKET.,"“Now tailor and merchant, and weaver, too,"
3685,THE JACKET.,"And spinner and farmer, my thanks to you!"

3693,THE FIREWORKS.,
3694,THE FIREWORKS.,
3695,THE FIREWORKS.,ONCE upon a time a little girl went to see the fireworks on Boston
3696,THE FIREWORKS.,"Common. She was a very small girl, but she wanted to go just as much"
3697,THE FIREWORKS.,"as if she had been big, so her mother said she might go with Mary, the"
3698,THE FIREWORKS.,"nurse. She put on her best bonnet, and her pink frock, and off they"
3699,THE FIREWORKS.,went.
3700,THE FIREWORKS.,
3701,THE FIREWORKS.,"The Common was crowded with people, and in one part there was a dense"
3702,THE FIREWORKS.,"throng, all standing together, and all looking in one direction. “We"
3703,THE FIREWORKS.,"must stand there, too,” said Mary; “there’s where the fireworks are"
3704,THE FIREWORKS.,going to be.” So they went and stood in the dense crowd; and the little
3705,THE FIREWORKS.,"girl saw the back of a fat woman in a red plaid shawl, but she could"
3706,THE FIREWORKS.,"not see anything else. Oh, yes! she saw the legs of the tall man who"
3707,THE FIREWORKS.,"stood next to the fat woman, but they were not very interesting, being"
3708,THE FIREWORKS.,"clad in a common sort of dark plaid: the shawl, at least, was bright,"
3709,THE FIREWORKS.,and she could tell the different colours by the lamplight.
3710,THE FIREWORKS.,
3711,THE FIREWORKS.,"Now there was a movement in the crowd, and people cried, “Oh! oh!"
3712,THE FIREWORKS.,look at that! Isn’t that a beauty?” And they clapped their hands
3713,THE FIREWORKS.,and shouted; but the little girl saw only the plaid shawl and the
3714,THE FIREWORKS.,uninteresting legs of the tall man. The people pressed closer and
3715,THE FIREWORKS.,"closer, so that she could hardly breathe. She held tight to Mary’s"
3716,THE FIREWORKS.,"hand, and Mary thought she was squeezing it for pleasure, and said,"
3717,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Yes, dear! ain’t they lovely?” The little girl tried to say, “I can’t"
3718,THE FIREWORKS.,see anything but the plaid shawl!” but just then the tall man turned
3719,THE FIREWORKS.,"round, and looked down on her and said, “Bless me! here’s a little girl"
3720,THE FIREWORKS.,"right under my feet. Can you see anything, my dear?”"
3721,THE FIREWORKS.,
3722,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Nothing but the red shawl and the back of your legs,” said the little"
3723,THE FIREWORKS.,"girl, sadly."
3724,THE FIREWORKS.,
3725,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Hi, then!” said the tall man; “up with you!” And before the child"
3726,THE FIREWORKS.,"could say a word, he had taken her two hands and lifted her lightly to"
3727,THE FIREWORKS.,his shoulder.
3728,THE FIREWORKS.,
3729,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Put your arm round my neck,” said the tall man. “I had a little girl"
3730,THE FIREWORKS.,"once, just like you, and I know how to hold you. So, now you are all"
3731,THE FIREWORKS.,right!”
3732,THE FIREWORKS.,
3733,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Thank the kind gentleman, dear!” said Mary. “I’m sure it’s very good"
3734,THE FIREWORKS.,of him.”
3735,THE FIREWORKS.,
3736,THE FIREWORKS.,"The little girl was too shy to speak, but she patted the tall man’s"
3737,THE FIREWORKS.,"neck, and he understood as well as if she had spoken. Now she saw"
3738,THE FIREWORKS.,"wonderful sights indeed! Fiery serpents went up into the sky,"
3739,THE FIREWORKS.,"wriggling and hissing, dragging long tails of yellow flame behind"
3740,THE FIREWORKS.,"them. Coloured stars, red, blue and green, shot up in the air, hung"
3741,THE FIREWORKS.,"for an instant, and then burst into showers of rainbow light. There"
3742,THE FIREWORKS.,"were golden pigeons, and golden flower-pots, and splendid wheels, that"
3743,THE FIREWORKS.,went whirling round so fast it made the little girl dizzy to look at
3744,THE FIREWORKS.,"them. The child gazed and gazed, breathless with delight. Sometimes"
3745,THE FIREWORKS.,"she forgot where she was, and thought this was fairy-land, all full"
3746,THE FIREWORKS.,"of golden dragons, and fluttering elves, as the story books described"
3747,THE FIREWORKS.,"it; but if she chanced to look down, there was Mary, and the kind face"
3748,THE FIREWORKS.,"of the tall man, and the red shawl of the fat woman. By and by came a"
3749,THE FIREWORKS.,"great burst of light, and in the midst of crimson flames she saw the"
3750,THE FIREWORKS.,"Goddess of Liberty, standing on a golden ball, waving the starry flag"
3751,THE FIREWORKS.,"in her hand: thousands of stars shot up, blazed and burst; loud noises"
3752,THE FIREWORKS.,"were heard, like cannon-shots; then, suddenly, darkness fell, and all"
3753,THE FIREWORKS.,was over.
3754,THE FIREWORKS.,
3755,THE FIREWORKS.,The crowd began to disperse.
3756,THE FIREWORKS.,
3757,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Now, little one,” said the tall man, “you have seen all there is to"
3758,THE FIREWORKS.,see.” And he made a motion to put her down; but the little girl clung
3759,THE FIREWORKS.,tight to his neck.
3760,THE FIREWORKS.,
3761,THE FIREWORKS.,“Did your little girl ever kiss you?” she whispered in his ear.
3762,THE FIREWORKS.,
3763,THE FIREWORKS.,"“Bless your little heart!” said the man, “she did, indeed; but it’s"
3764,THE FIREWORKS.,long since I’ve had a little girl to kiss me.”
3765,THE FIREWORKS.,
3766,THE FIREWORKS.,The child bent down and kissed him heartily on the cheek. “If it hadn’t
3767,THE FIREWORKS.,"been for you,” she cried, “I should have seen nothing at all except the"
3768,THE FIREWORKS.,"plaid shawl. I think you are the kindest man that ever lived, and I"
3769,THE FIREWORKS.,"love you very much.” And then she slipped down, and taking her nurse’s"
3770,THE FIREWORKS.,"hand, ran away home as fast as she could."

3910,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"“JOHN,” said little Amy, “did you ever send a valentine to anybody?”"
3911,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3912,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"John, the gardener, looked rather sheepish, and dug his spade into the"
3913,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"geranium bed. “Well, miss,” he said, “I _have_ done such things when I"
3914,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"were a lad. Most lads do, I suppose, miss.”"
3915,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3916,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Oh, that sly old John! He knew perfectly well that he had a valentine"
3917,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"in his pocket at that moment, a great crimson heart, in a lace-trimmed"
3918,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"envelope, directed to Susan, the pretty housemaid. But there was no"
3919,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"need of saying anything about that to little miss, he thought."
3920,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3921,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"“If you were not so _very_ old, John,” continued Amy, looking seriously"
3922,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"at him, “I should ask you to send me one, because my Papa is away, and"
3923,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"I have no brothers, and I don’t know any lads, as you call them. But I"
3924,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"suppose you are altogether _too_ old, aren’t you, John?”"
3925,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3926,AMY’S VALENTINE.,John straightened his broad shoulders and looked down rather comically
3927,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"at the tiny mite at his feet. “Why, Miss Amy,” he said, “whatever does"
3928,AMY’S VALENTINE.,make you think I be so _very_ old? Your Papa is a good bit older than I
3929,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"be, miss.”"
3930,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3931,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"“My Papa!” cried Amy, opening her eyes very wide. “Why, John! you told"
3932,AMY’S VALENTINE.,me yourself that you were a hundred years old. And I _know_ my Papa
3933,AMY’S VALENTINE.,isn’t _nearly_ so old as that!”
3934,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3935,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"The gardener laughed. “More shame to me, miss,” he said, “for telling"
3936,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"you what wasn’t true. Sure it’s only in fun I was, Miss Amy, dear,"
3937,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"for I’m not forty years old yet, let alone a hundred. But I hear Mary"
3938,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"calling you to your dinner; so run up to the house now, missy, and"
3939,AMY’S VALENTINE.,don’t think too much of what old John says to you.”
3940,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3941,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Away ran little Amy, and John, left alone with his geraniums, indulged"
3942,AMY’S VALENTINE.,in a quiet but hearty laugh.
3943,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3944,AMY’S VALENTINE.,“To think of that!” he said to himself. “A hundred years old! Sure I
3945,AMY’S VALENTINE.,must take care what I say to that young one. But the pretty lass shall
3946,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"have her valentine, that she shall, and as pretty a one as I can make!”"
3947,AMY’S VALENTINE.,and John dug his spade into the ground with right good-will.
3948,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3949,AMY’S VALENTINE.,(It occurs to me that you children who live in the North may say
3950,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"here, “What was he doing to the geranium-bed in February?” but when I"
3951,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"tell you that little Amy lives in Virginia, you will not think it so"
3952,AMY’S VALENTINE.,strange.)
3953,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3954,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Saint Valentine’s Day was bright and sunny, and Amy was up early,"
3955,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"flying about the house like a bird, and running every five minutes to"
3956,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"the front door “’Cause there _might_ be a valentine, Mamma!”"
3957,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3958,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Presently she spied the postman coming up the gravel walk, and out she"
3959,AMY’S VALENTINE.,danced to meet him. Oh! such a pile of letters as he took out of his
3960,AMY’S VALENTINE.,leather bag.
3961,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3962,AMY’S VALENTINE.,“Miss Amy Russell?” said the postman.
3963,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3964,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"“Oh!” cried Amy, “she’s me! I mean me’s her! I mean—oh! oh! one, two,"
3965,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"three, four, five! Oh, thank you, Mr. Postman! You’re the best postman"
3966,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"in the whole world!” And in she danced again, to show her treasures to"
3967,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Mamma. Gold lace, silver arrows, flaming hearts! oh, how beautiful they"
3968,AMY’S VALENTINE.,were! But suddenly—ting! tingle! _ding!_ a tremendous peal at the front
3969,AMY’S VALENTINE.,door-bell.
3970,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3971,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Down went the valentines in Mamma’s lap, and off flew the excited child"
3972,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"again. But this time, when she opened the door, no sound escaped her"
3973,AMY’S VALENTINE.,lips. Her feelings were too deep for utterance.
3974,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3975,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"There on the doorstep lay a valentine, but _such_ a valentine! A large"
3976,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"flat basket entirely filled with white carnations, with a border"
3977,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"of scarlet geraniums, and in the middle a huge heart of deep red"
3978,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"carnations, with the words “My Valentine” written under it in violets."
3979,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3980,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"Amy sat down on the doorstep, with clasped hands and wide-open eyes"
3981,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"and mouth. She rocked herself backwards and forwards, uttering little"
3982,AMY’S VALENTINE.,inarticulate shrieks of delight.
3983,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3984,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"And John the gardener, peeping round the corner of the house, chuckled"
3985,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"silently, and squeezed the hand of Susan, the pretty housemaid, who"
3986,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"happened, curiously enough, to be standing very near him."
3987,AMY’S VALENTINE.,
3988,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"“Humph!” said John the gardener, “I haven’t forgotten how to make"
3989,AMY’S VALENTINE.,"valentines, if I _be_ a hundred years old!”"

3996,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
3997,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"ONCE upon a time there was a little girl, just like you, who couldn’t"
3998,ONCE UPON A TIME.,count two. And she had a dreadful time about it! She did not know she
3999,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"had two feet, so she sometimes forgot to put on both her shoes; she did"
4000,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"not know she had two eyes, so she would sometimes go to sleep with one"
4001,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"eye, and stay awake with the other; she did not know she had two ears,"
4002,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"so she would sometimes hear half of what Mamma said, and not hear the"
4003,ONCE UPON A TIME.,other.
4004,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4005,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"One day Mamma called to her and said, “Pet, I want you to take this"
4006,ONCE UPON A TIME.,syrup and put it in my closet!”
4007,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4008,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"Now Pet was only listening with one ear, and so she only heard the"
4009,ONCE UPON A TIME.,first half of what Mamma said: “I want you to take this syrup.” That
4010,ONCE UPON A TIME.,was what she heard.
4011,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4012,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"She liked the syrup very much, for she had ten drops in a teaspoon"
4013,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"whenever she had a sore throat, and she had always wished Mamma would"
4014,ONCE UPON A TIME.,give her more.
4015,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4016,ONCE UPON A TIME.,And now she was just to “take it.” That must mean to take the whole
4017,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"bottle, if she liked. She put the bottle to her lips and took a good"
4018,ONCE UPON A TIME.,long draught. It was more than half-empty when she stopped to take
4019,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"breath, and then,—the syrup did not seem to taste good any longer. She"
4020,ONCE UPON A TIME.,put the bottle down.
4021,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4022,ONCE UPON A TIME.,Oh—dear—me! In about ten minutes Pet was the very sickest little girl
4023,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"you ever saw in your life. Mamma put her to bed, and sent for the"
4024,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"doctor, and she had to take four different kinds of medicine before she"
4025,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"got well, not one of which tasted good at all."
4026,ONCE UPON A TIME.,
4027,ONCE UPON A TIME.,"So now, you see, it is a very good plan for little wee girls to learn"
4028,ONCE UPON A TIME.,to count two.

4075,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4076,GOOSEY LUCY.,"IT chanced one day that Lucy came into the kitchen just as Fido, her"
4077,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Aunt Mary’s little dog, was eating his dinner."
4078,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4079,GOOSEY LUCY.,"He had a good dinner, and he was making a great fuss over it, growling"
4080,GOOSEY LUCY.,"with pleasure, shaking his ears and wagging his tail."
4081,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4082,GOOSEY LUCY.,"His tail was a very funny one, with a little black bunch at the end of"
4083,GOOSEY LUCY.,"it, and it wiggled and waggled this way and that way."
4084,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4085,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Fido,” said Lucy, “I don’t think you ought to wag your tail when you"
4086,GOOSEY LUCY.,"are eating. Mamma says we must sit very still at the table. To be sure,"
4087,GOOSEY LUCY.,"you are not sitting, and you are not at the table, but, all the same, I"
4088,GOOSEY LUCY.,think you had better not wag your tail.”
4089,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4090,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Fido paid no attention to these sensible remarks, but continued briskly"
4091,GOOSEY LUCY.,to wag the offending tail.
4092,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4093,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Do you hear me Fido?” said Lucy. “I say, _don’t wag_ it!”"
4094,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4095,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Fido gave a short bark of protest, but took no further notice."
4096,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4097,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Then I must hold it for you!” Lucy continued, severely. “Mamma held my"
4098,GOOSEY LUCY.,hands once when I would not stop cutting holes in my pinafore; but I
4099,GOOSEY LUCY.,"was young then, and I thought the spots ought to be taken out. But you"
4100,GOOSEY LUCY.,"are not young, Fido, and I wonder at you, that I do!”"
4101,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4102,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Then Lucy took hold of the tail, and tried to hold it; but Fido danced"
4103,GOOSEY LUCY.,"about, and pulled it away, and then wagged it all the harder, thinking"
4104,GOOSEY LUCY.,she meant to play with him.
4105,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4106,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Indeed!” said Lucy, “I am not playing, Master Fido. Now you shall see!”"
4107,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4108,GOOSEY LUCY.,"So she got a piece of stout twine, and tied Fido’s tail to the leg of a"
4109,GOOSEY LUCY.,chair.
4110,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4111,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“There!” she said, “now finish your dinner, like a good little dog, and"
4112,GOOSEY LUCY.,don’t give me any more trouble.”
4113,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4114,GOOSEY LUCY.,But Fido would not eat his dinner with his tail tied up. He threw back
4115,GOOSEY LUCY.,"his head, and gave a piteous little howl. Lucy sat down on a stool"
4116,GOOSEY LUCY.,"beside him, and folding her hands, as she had seen her mother do,"
4117,GOOSEY LUCY.,"prepared to give the naughty pet “a good talking to,” as nurse used to"
4118,GOOSEY LUCY.,say.
4119,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4120,GOOSEY LUCY.,"At that moment, however, her mother’s voice was heard, calling “Lucy!"
4121,GOOSEY LUCY.,Lucy! Where are you?”
4122,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4123,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Here, Mamma!” cried Lucy. “I am coming! I meant to pick them up before"
4124,GOOSEY LUCY.,"dinner, anyhow! yes I did!” And she flew up stairs, for she knew quite"
4125,GOOSEY LUCY.,"well that she had set out all her doll’s dishes, tea-set and dinner-set"
4126,GOOSEY LUCY.,"and kitchen things, on the nursery floor, and left them there."
4127,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4128,GOOSEY LUCY.,"And now nurse had come in with baby in her arms, and had walked right"
4129,GOOSEY LUCY.,"over the pretty French dinner-set, and there was very little of it left"
4130,GOOSEY LUCY.,to tell the tale.
4131,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4132,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Dear! dear! it was not at all nice to pick up the pieces, even if nurse"
4133,GOOSEY LUCY.,"had not been scolding all the time, and Mamma standing by with that"
4134,GOOSEY LUCY.,"grave look, waiting to see that it was properly done."
4135,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4136,GOOSEY LUCY.,"But how about Fido? Oh, Lucy had quite forgotten about Fido. But Fido"
4137,GOOSEY LUCY.,"had not forgotten himself, and a very hard time the poor little fellow"
4138,GOOSEY LUCY.,was having.
4139,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4140,GOOSEY LUCY.,"He ran round the chair several times, till he brought himself up close"
4141,GOOSEY LUCY.,"against it; then he tried to unwind himself again, but only became"
4142,GOOSEY LUCY.,more and more entangled. He pushed the hateful chair backwards till it
4143,GOOSEY LUCY.,struck a little table on which was a tray full of dishes. Over went the
4144,GOOSEY LUCY.,"table, down went the tray, crash went the dishes!"
4145,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4146,GOOSEY LUCY.,“Yow! yow! yo-o-o-_ow_!” howled Fido.
4147,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4148,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Oh! oh! oh!” shrieked Bridget, the cook, who came in at that moment;"
4149,GOOSEY LUCY.,and then—whack! whack! whack! went the broomstick over the poor
4150,GOOSEY LUCY.,doggie’s back.
4151,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4152,GOOSEY LUCY.,"The noise was so great that Mamma came flying down, and nurse and Lucy,"
4153,GOOSEY LUCY.,"too, with the broken soup tureen in her hand."
4154,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4155,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“Oh, don’t beat him!” cried Lucy, “don’t beat him, Bridget! It was my"
4156,GOOSEY LUCY.,"fault, for I tied him to the chair, and then forgot about him.”"
4157,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4158,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“And why, for the pity’s sake, miss, did ye tie the baste to the"
4159,GOOSEY LUCY.,"chair?” said Bridget, still angry. “Look at every dish I have in the"
4160,GOOSEY LUCY.,kitchen all broken in smithereens!”
4161,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4162,GOOSEY LUCY.,"“He _would_ wag his tail while he ate his dinner,” faltered Lucy, “and"
4163,GOOSEY LUCY.,I wanted to teach him better manners; and so—and so—” But here poor
4164,GOOSEY LUCY.,"Goosey Lucy broke down completely, and sat down among the shattered"
4165,GOOSEY LUCY.,"dishes, and hugged Fido and wept over him."
4166,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4167,GOOSEY LUCY.,"And Fido, who had the sweetest temper in the world, wagged the poor"
4168,GOOSEY LUCY.,"abused tail (which had been quickly released by nurse), and forgave her"
4169,GOOSEY LUCY.,at once.
4170,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4171,GOOSEY LUCY.,And Bridget and nurse laughed; and Mamma kissed her little foolish
4172,GOOSEY LUCY.,"daughter, and bade her not cry any more."
4173,GOOSEY LUCY.,
4174,GOOSEY LUCY.,"But Lucy had to go to bed, all the same, for Mamma said it was the only"
4175,GOOSEY LUCY.,"proper place for a child who had broken (or caused to be broken, which"
4176,GOOSEY LUCY.,"amounted to the same thing), _seventy-two_ dishes, large and small, in"
4177,GOOSEY LUCY.,"less than half an hour. And I suppose Mamma was right, don’t you?"

4200,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4201,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"She pondered a few minutes and then continued, “I think _I_ will go and"

4217,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"would think about the next place as she went along, but here was"

4219,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4220,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Lucy looked up at all the windows, but no one was in sight."
4221,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4222,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"So much the better! She planted herself squarely on the curbstone,"

4225,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4226,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Her grandmother, who was sitting quietly by the fire, reading, heard"
4227,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"the piercing screams, and running to the window as fast as her dear old"
4228,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"feet could carry her, saw Lucy, panting and crimson, with her mouth"
4229,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,just opening for another shout.
4230,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4231,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Something had happened at home,—an accident, probably! No time must be"
4232,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,lost. Grandmamma threw up the sash.
4233,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4234,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"“Run and call the doctor!” she cried. “Quick, dear! Don’t stop to tell"
4235,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"me about it, but run! I will be there in three minutes!” And she shut"
4236,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"the window, and trembling with anxiety, hastened to put on her shawl"
4237,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"and bonnet, and almost ran through the snow to her daughter’s house."
4238,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4239,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Meanwhile, Lucy ran on in high glee. “I hadn’t thought of the doctor!”"
4240,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"she said, “but of course I will go there, as Grandmamma wishes it. What"
4241,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,fun it is!”
4242,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4243,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"The doctor’s house was soon reached, and Lucy’s shouts brought the good"

4245,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4246,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"“Bless me!” he said, “Mrs. Graham’s little girl! Baby ill again,"
4247,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"I suppose? All right, my dear!” he cried to Lucy. “I’ll be there"
4248,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,instantly. Run and tell them I’m coming!” and he shut the door and
4249,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,called for his boots.
4250,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4251,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Lucy danced along, enchanted with her new play, and soon reached Aunt"
4252,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Maria’s house, where she called again, with might and main. Now, Aunt"
4253,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Maria was slightly deaf, and when she heard her own name resounding in"
4254,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"a clear, shrill scream, “Aunt Mari-i-i-i-_ia_!!” she thought it was a"
4255,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,cry of _fire_!
4256,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4257,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Throwing up the window (she was a very nervous and excitable person),"
4258,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"she shrieked, “Fire! fire! Police! watchman! Help! help! _Fire!!_"
4259,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"FIRE!!!” till everyone within a dozen blocks heard her, and came"
4260,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,rushing to the rescue with buckets and fire extinguishers.
4261,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4262,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Lucy was rather frightened at all this, and thought, on the whole, she"
4263,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,would not make any more calls that day.
4264,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4265,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"So she went home. And there were Grandmamma and the doctor and Mamma,"
4266,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"all waiting for her, with very grave faces."
4267,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4268,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"The two first had arrived, breathless and agitated, inquiring what had"
4269,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"happened, and who was ill."
4270,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4271,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,Much perplexity followed. And now that the author of all the mischief
4272,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"had arrived, what should be done to her?"
4273,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4274,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"Lucy’s finger went into her mouth, and her head went down."
4275,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4276,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,But she told her story truthfully; and it was such a funny one that the
4277,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"doctor burst into a roar of laughter, and Grandmamma laughed heartily,"
4278,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,and even Mamma could not look grave.
4279,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,
4280,GOOSEY LUCY’S NEW YEAR’S CALLS.,"So Goosey Lucy had a lecture, and a New Year’s cookie, and went to tell"

4327,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4328,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4329,THE QUACKY DUCK.,THE Quacky Duck stood on the bank of the stream. And the
4330,THE QUACKY DUCK.,frogs came and sat on stones and insulted him. Now the words
4331,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"which the frogs used were these,—"
4332,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4333,THE QUACKY DUCK.,“Ya! ha! he hasn’t any hind-legs!
4334,THE QUACKY DUCK.,Ya! ha! he hasn’t any fore-legs!
4335,THE QUACKY DUCK.,Oh! what horrid luck
4336,THE QUACKY DUCK.,To be a Quacky Duck!”
4337,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4338,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"These were not pleasant words. And when the Quacky Duck heard them, he"
4339,THE QUACKY DUCK.,considered within himself whether it would not be best for him to eat
4340,THE QUACKY DUCK.,the frogs.
4341,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4342,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"“Two good things would come of it,” he said. “I should have a savoury"
4343,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"meal, and their remarks would no longer be audible.”"
4344,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4345,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"So he fell upon the frogs, and they fled before him. And one jumped"
4346,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"into the water, and one jumped on the land, and another jumped into the"
4347,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"reeds; for such is their manner. But one of them, being in fear, saw"
4348,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"not clearly the way he should go, and jumped even upon the back of the"
4349,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"Quacky Duck. Now, this displeased the Quacky Duck, and he said, “If you"
4350,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"will remove yourself from my person, we will speak further of this.”"
4351,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4352,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"So the frog, being also willing, strove to remove himself, and the"
4353,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"result was that they two, being on the edge of the bank, fell into the"
4354,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"water. Then the frog departed swiftly, saying, “Solitude is best for"
4355,THE QUACKY DUCK.,meditation.”
4356,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4357,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"But the Quacky Duck, having hit his head against a stone, sank to the"
4358,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"bottom of the pond, where he found himself in the frogs’ kitchen. And"
4359,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"there he spied a fish, which the frogs had caught for their dinner,"
4360,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"intending to share it in a brotherly manner, for it was a savoury fish."
4361,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"When the Quacky Duck saw it, he was glad; and he said, “Fish is better"
4362,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"than frog” (for he was an English duck)! And, taking the fish, he swam"
4363,THE QUACKY DUCK.,with speed to the shore.
4364,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4365,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"Now the frogs lamented when they saw him go, for they said, “He has our"
4366,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"savoury fish!” And they wept, and reviled the Quacky Duck."
4367,THE QUACKY DUCK.,
4368,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"But he said, “Be comforted! for if I had not found the fish, I should"
4369,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"assuredly have eaten you. Therefore, say now, which is the better for"
4370,THE QUACKY DUCK.,"you?” And he ate the fish, and departed joyful."

4560,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4561,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“Little maiden fair to see,"

4580,THE PURPLE FISH.,"beautiful. She shook her head resolutely, and replied,—"
4581,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4582,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“If you please, I do not wish"
4583,THE PURPLE FISH.,For to marry any fish!”
4584,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4585,THE PURPLE FISH.,"Then the purple fish was angry, and his yellow tail quivered with"
4586,THE PURPLE FISH.,"vexation. He said, sternly,—"
4587,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4588,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“If you will not be my wife,"
4589,THE PURPLE FISH.,You shall stay here all your life!”
4590,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4591,THE PURPLE FISH.,"And off he swam, taking the green cart with him. Poor Elsie was very"
4592,THE PURPLE FISH.,"unhappy, for she could not bear to think of spending her whole life on"
4593,THE PURPLE FISH.,"the island, and yet she did not want to marry a fish, even if her Mamma"
4594,THE PURPLE FISH.,"were willing, which she was quite sure she would not be. But, as she"
4595,THE PURPLE FISH.,"was sitting there, making a wreath of the yellow violets, two sea-gulls"
4596,THE PURPLE FISH.,"came flying by. They stopped when they saw Elsie, and one of them said,—"
4597,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4598,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“Here, upon this purple island,"
4599,THE PURPLE FISH.,What do I see but a human chisland!”
4600,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4601,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“There isn’t any such word as ‘chisland!’” said Elsie. “It is ‘child,’"
4602,THE PURPLE FISH.,don’t you know?”
4603,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4604,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“I am not very familiar with English,” replied the sea-gull. “The other"
4605,THE PURPLE FISH.,"word rhymes better; but I am not prejudiced. What are you doing here,"
4606,THE PURPLE FISH.,child?”
4607,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4608,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“Nothing!” replied Elsie. “If you please, did you ever marry a fish?”"
4609,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4610,THE PURPLE FISH.,"Both the sea-gulls showed strong signs of disgust at this, and said,—"
4611,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4612,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“We eat fish, but never marry them. Why do you ask?”"
4613,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4614,THE PURPLE FISH.,“Because the purple fish with the yellow tail said I must stay here all
4615,THE PURPLE FISH.,"my life unless I would marry him. And he has taken away my green cart,"
4616,THE PURPLE FISH.,so that I cannot get home.”
4617,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4618,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“As to that,” said the sea-gulls, “we can easily manage to get you"
4619,THE PURPLE FISH.,home. Put your arms around our necks and hold on tight!”
4620,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4621,THE PURPLE FISH.,"So the sea-gulls flew away with Elsie, and brought her safely home. She"
4622,THE PURPLE FISH.,kissed them and thanked them.
4623,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4624,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“What can I give you, dear sea-gulls,” she asked, “in return for your"
4625,THE PURPLE FISH.,saving me from that horrid fish?”
4626,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4627,THE PURPLE FISH.,“Could you give us your golden curls?” asked the sea-gulls. “We think
4628,THE PURPLE FISH.,"they would become us, and they are a thing not often seen in our"
4629,THE PURPLE FISH.,society.”
4630,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4631,THE PURPLE FISH.,"No, Elsie could not do that."
4632,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4633,THE PURPLE FISH.,"“But,” she said, “I can give you each a necklace of glass beads,"
4634,THE PURPLE FISH.,fastened with a rosette of peach-coloured ribbon. I made them yesterday
4635,THE PURPLE FISH.,"for my dolls, but you are welcome to them.”"
4636,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4637,THE PURPLE FISH.,“Just the thing!” said the sea-gulls.
4638,THE PURPLE FISH.,
4639,THE PURPLE FISH.,"So Elsie put the necklaces round their necks, and they thanked her, and"
4640,THE PURPLE FISH.,"flew away. I have been told that they flew straight to the island, and"
4641,THE PURPLE FISH.,spent the whole afternoon in making rude remarks to the purple fish
4642,THE PURPLE FISH.,"with the yellow tail, but one need not believe all one hears."

4700,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.
4701,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4702,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4703,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"THE sleigh had just driven from the door, with a great jingling and"
4704,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"shouting, and the little boy was left at home, with his foot up on the"
4705,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"sofa, for he had a sprained ankle. “I wish I could have gone!” said the"
4706,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,little boy.
4707,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4708,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"“You shall go!” said Sister Sunshine. “We will go together, you and I!”"
4709,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4710,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"She brought a great book, with bright pictures in it, and sat down by"
4711,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,the little boy’s side.
4712,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4713,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"“First, we must choose our carriage!” she said. There was a whole page"
4714,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"of carriage pictures, all very splendid, and after some thought they"
4715,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"chose a gilded shell, with the front turning over into a swan’s neck."
4716,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"An Empress of Russia had driven in this, the book said, and so they"
4717,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"thought it was good enough for them. The horses were coal-black, and"
4718,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"there were six of them, four more than Papa and the other children had."
4719,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"Sister Sunshine tucked the little boy well up, and it appeared that the"
4720,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"robes were all of ermine and sable, whereas, he had been thinking that"
4721,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,they were only a striped afghan. One does not always know things till
4722,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,one is told.
4723,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4724,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,“Here we go!” cried Sister Sunshine. “How the horses dash along! It
4725,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,takes my breath away! We are going to St. Petersburg to see the ice
4726,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,palace on the Neva. The Empress has sent her own private sleigh to take
4727,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"the little boy, and I can go, too, because I belong to him.”"
4728,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4729,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"She turned the page, and there, sure enough, was the ice palace. The"
4730,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"sun shone splendidly on it, and it looked as if the fairies had built"
4731,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,it.
4732,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4733,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,“There is the Empress waiting for us!” said Sister Sunshine. “I suppose
4734,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"it would be polite to go in, wouldn’t it?” The little boy thought it"
4735,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"would, decidedly, so they took the Empress’s hand and went in, through"
4736,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,one grand room after another. The Empress gave them each a lovely
4737,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"little porcelain stove to carry under their arm, for the ice halls were"
4738,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,cold.
4739,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4740,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"“I am used to it,” she said, “and do not mind it.” She showed them"
4741,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"all her jewels, which shone and sparkled like living flames; and then"
4742,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"she brought them long sticks of candy, striped red and white, and"
4743,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"cream walnuts, and barley sugar lions, just the things the little boy"
4744,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"liked best; and they both said, how funny it was that she should know"
4745,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"all about it, when the people at home so often forgot and gave him"
4746,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"horehound, which he could not abide, and then said it was good for his"
4747,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,cold.
4748,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4749,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"After that they drove a long way over the ice, and the little boy"
4750,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,thought he would like to go to Egypt and see if they knew their lessons
4751,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"about Moses there, because he sometimes forgot his. And there was"
4752,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"Egypt, just a few pages off, with lots of pyramids, and the Sphinx, and"
4753,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,all the right Egypty things. They got on camels and went to find some
4754,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"children, and there, to be sure, were plenty of them, all looking just"
4755,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,exactly like the pictures in the Bible; but not a single one of them
4756,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"knew anything about Moses, which made the little boy feel more puffed"
4757,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,up than he had any reason to be.
4758,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,
4759,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"They left the carriage and got into a Nile boat, because they wanted to"
4760,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"go over the Cataracts, and Sister Sunshine thought the horses might not"
4761,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,like it; but before they got to the very first one the little boy was
4762,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"sound asleep, and he never woke up till the others came home from their"
4763,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,sleigh ride. He was quite sure that they could not possibly have had so
4764,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,"good a time as he had; and, anyhow, nobody had given them so much as a"
4765,A CHRISTMAS RIDE.,single bite of candy; they said that themselves.

4770,A FUNNY FELLOW.,A FUNNY FELLOW.
4771,A FUNNY FELLOW.,
4772,A FUNNY FELLOW.,
4773,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"A GREAT many queer things happen in this world, and this morning I"
4774,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"saw one of them. We have a little aquarium,—just a long glass box,"
4775,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"with some stones arranged in it to form a pretty little rock-work, and"
4776,A FUNNY FELLOW.,plenty of bladder-wort for the fish to feed on.
4777,A FUNNY FELLOW.,
4778,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"We have a good many fish,—three stickle-backs, and a lot of dace, the"
4779,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"pretty silver dace, and some minnows and a crayfish; but the pride"
4780,A FUNNY FELLOW.,of the aquarium is the newt. Did you ever see a newt? He is a little
4781,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"creature, like a lizard, about two inches long; in color, light brown,"
4782,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"with black spots. He is quite tame, and not in the least afraid of"
4783,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"us. Well, yesterday morning I was watching the fish, and seeing that"
4784,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"the greedy ones did not get more than their share of breakfast, when"
4785,A FUNNY FELLOW.,Master Newt came up out of the water and seated himself on the top
4786,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"of the rock-work, which projects an inch or two above the surface."
4787,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"He sat quite still for a few minutes, and I made no motion, thinking"
4788,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"he had come to take a look at the upper world, and would prefer to"
4789,A FUNNY FELLOW.,be left to himself. Presently he began to move his little paws about
4790,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"(they are just like tiny hands, with long, thin fingers), and to rub"
4791,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"himself, and wriggle about in a very queer way. I had watched him"
4792,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"for some minutes before I realized what he was doing, but suddenly"
4793,A FUNNY FELLOW.,it flashed upon me that he was going to change his skin. I knew that
4794,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"newts often changed their skin, but I never expected to see one do"
4795,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"it. Presently it was loose enough, and my little friend began to draw"
4796,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"it off, slowly, beginning with the paws. The skin came off in perfect"
4797,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"shape, and in a moment there was a pair of fairy gloves floating in"
4798,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"the water, the prettiest things that ever were seen. Next, Master Newt"
4799,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"began to unbutton his waistcoat, so to speak, and then to take off"
4800,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"coat, waistcoat, breeches and all. He did look very fine in his new"
4801,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"coat, which shone with lovely colours, and was as soft and smooth as"
4802,A FUNNY FELLOW.,gossamer. I thought I should like to have a new dress every day if I
4803,A FUNNY FELLOW.,could manage it with no more trouble than this. But what was he going
4804,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"to do with his old clothes? There were no closets in the aquarium, no"
4805,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"clothes-bags, no obliging old-clothes-fish who would take it off his"
4806,A FUNNY FELLOW.,hands and give him a trifle for it. What would he do with the old suit?
4807,A FUNNY FELLOW.,
4808,A FUNNY FELLOW.,I was soon to see. Master Newt sat still for a few minutes after his
4809,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"great feat, seeming to enjoy the change, waving his delicate crest with"
4810,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"evident satisfaction; then he took up the old suit of skin, which lay"
4811,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"on the rock beside him. And then,—who can guess what he did next? Mind,"
4812,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"I saw this with my own two eyes, the very ones that are looking down on"
4813,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"this paper as I write. Why, he rolled it up carefully, made a ball of"
4814,A FUNNY FELLOW.,"it, and then ate it up!"

4895,THE SNOWBALL.,could be more delightful?
4896,THE SNOWBALL.,
4897,THE SNOWBALL.,"Rita was too little to go to school, but she was not too little to make"
4898,THE SNOWBALL.,snowballs.
4899,THE SNOWBALL.,

4903,THE SNOWBALL.,"Oh, how bright it was! How the world sparkled and twinkled and laughed!"
4904,THE SNOWBALL.,"Rita laughed, too, and at first could only jump up and down for pure"

4906,THE SNOWBALL.,
4907,THE SNOWBALL.,“Ho! ho! ho!
4908,THE SNOWBALL.,Pretty white snow!”
4909,THE SNOWBALL.,
4910,THE SNOWBALL.,"A song of her own composition, of which she was justly proud."
4911,THE SNOWBALL.,
4912,THE SNOWBALL.,"But presently she said to herself, “snowballs!” and from that moment"
4913,THE SNOWBALL.,she had no time for singing or jumping.
4914,THE SNOWBALL.,
4915,THE SNOWBALL.,"First she made some dumplings, and set them in a row on the piazza to"
4916,THE SNOWBALL.,"bake in the sun; then she saw three little birds in a tree, and threw"
4917,THE SNOWBALL.,"the dumplings at them, in case they might be hungry."
4918,THE SNOWBALL.,
4919,THE SNOWBALL.,"Then she made a pudding, and stirred it with a large icicle, which made"
4920,THE SNOWBALL.,"the best possible pudding stick; then she made some eggs, and pelted"
4921,THE SNOWBALL.,Rover with them till that good dog fairly yelled with excitement.
4922,THE SNOWBALL.,
4923,THE SNOWBALL.,"At last she said, “_I_ know what I will do! I’ll make a Great Snowball,"

4925,THE SNOWBALL.,
4926,THE SNOWBALL.,"So the little girl set to work, and rolled and patted and pressed"
4927,THE SNOWBALL.,till she had a well-shaped ball to begin with. Then she laid it on

4930,THE SNOWBALL.,
4931,THE SNOWBALL.,"The snow was in perfect condition, soft and moist; every particle clung"

4934,THE SNOWBALL.,"At last Rita’s arms were tired, and she stopped to rest and to look"

4946,THE SNOWBALL.,"And then Papa would say, “Why-ee! what a great, big girl my Rita is! I"
4947,THE SNOWBALL.,"must take her to town to-morrow-day, and buy her a muff, and a doll"
4948,THE SNOWBALL.,"with wink eyes, and a squeaky dog, and a prayer-book, and a nalbum, and"
4949,THE SNOWBALL.,"big boots, and a gold watch and a stick of striped candy! and then—”"
4950,THE SNOWBALL.,But by this time Rita was quite ready to go to work again.
4951,THE SNOWBALL.,
4952,THE SNOWBALL.,"The snowball was very big by this time, quite as big as she was; and"
4953,THE SNOWBALL.,"the bank, though not high, was very steep. But Rita’s short arms were"
4954,THE SNOWBALL.,"sturdy, and her courage knew no measure; so at it she went, pushing"
4955,THE SNOWBALL.,"the great ball up, inch by inch; puffing, panting, her cheeks growing"
4956,THE SNOWBALL.,"redder and redder, but with no thought of giving up."
4957,THE SNOWBALL.,
4958,THE SNOWBALL.,"Now, by this time the snowball began to have its own ideas. Just at"
4959,THE SNOWBALL.,what point of bigness a snowball begins to have a mind of its own
4960,THE SNOWBALL.,"I cannot tell you, so you must ask some one wiser than I; but this"
4961,THE SNOWBALL.,snowball had reached the point.
4962,THE SNOWBALL.,
4963,THE SNOWBALL.,"At this moment it was saying to itself, “What fun this child is having!"
4964,THE SNOWBALL.,"but I do not enjoy it at all. It is the pushing that is the fun,"
4965,THE SNOWBALL.,apparently. Why should not I push the child? I am bigger than she; it
4966,THE SNOWBALL.,"would be very pleasant to roll down the bank, and push her before me. I"
4967,THE SNOWBALL.,might try! I think I will! There!”
4968,THE SNOWBALL.,
4969,THE SNOWBALL.,"Down went the snowball! Down went little Rita! roly-poly,"
4970,THE SNOWBALL.,"rumble-tumble, ruffle-puffle, _flop_!"
4971,THE SNOWBALL.,
4972,THE SNOWBALL.,"When Papa drove into the yard, two minutes later, he saw a great mound"
4973,THE SNOWBALL.,"of soft snow, with two little black legs sticking out of it."
4974,THE SNOWBALL.,
4975,THE SNOWBALL.,"“Never mind!” said Rita, shortly, when Papa had pulled her out, and she"
4976,THE SNOWBALL.,"stood shaking the snow from her wet, rosy face, “the old thing didn’t"
4977,THE SNOWBALL.,"hurt me a bit, and it broke its old self all—to pieces!”"

4982,A GREAT FIGHT.,A GREAT FIGHT.
4983,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4984,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4985,A GREAT FIGHT.,THE first I heard of it was when Fred came rushing into the house after
4986,A GREAT FIGHT.,breakfast.
4987,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4988,A GREAT FIGHT.,“The enemy!” he cried. “The enemy is upon us!”
4989,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4990,A GREAT FIGHT.,"“Where?” cried the rest of us, jumping up."
4991,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4992,A GREAT FIGHT.,"“In the battle-field, of course!” he said; and he seized his flag and"
4993,A GREAT FIGHT.,rushed out again.
4994,A GREAT FIGHT.,
4995,A GREAT FIGHT.,"We followed as quickly as we could. I put on the helmet, and Max took"
4996,A GREAT FIGHT.,"the drum, and we let Toddles have the bugle this time, because he had"
4997,A GREAT FIGHT.,"just tumbled down; and he had the hearth-broom, too, so he was all"
4998,A GREAT FIGHT.,"right. We ran into the field, and found that the enemy had taken up a"
4999,A GREAT FIGHT.,"strong position behind the old cannon. (Ours is a _real_ battle-field,"
5000,A GREAT FIGHT.,"you know, and has been there ever since the war.) We formed in line,"
5001,A GREAT FIGHT.,"and Fred made a flank movement, meaning to take the enemy in the rear;"
5002,A GREAT FIGHT.,"but when he heard Fred coming, he charged on our line, and Toddles ran"
5003,A GREAT FIGHT.,"away, but Max and I retreated in good order, and formed again behind a"
5004,A GREAT FIGHT.,"rock, and began to shell him with green apples. He stopped to eat the"
5005,A GREAT FIGHT.,"apples, and meanwhile Fred completed his flank movement, and falling on"
5006,A GREAT FIGHT.,"the enemy’s rear, whacked it violently with a stick, waving his flag"
5007,A GREAT FIGHT.,"all the time, and shouting, “Yield, caitiff! Yield, craven hound!” (I"
5008,A GREAT FIGHT.,"tell him that nowadays people don’t _say_ those things in war, but he"
5009,A GREAT FIGHT.,"says that Roland and Bayard did, and that what suited them will suit"
5010,A GREAT FIGHT.,him.)
5011,A GREAT FIGHT.,
5012,A GREAT FIGHT.,[Illustration]
5013,A GREAT FIGHT.,
5014,A GREAT FIGHT.,"Well, the enemy turned suddenly on Fred, and drove him back against the"
5015,A GREAT FIGHT.,"cannon: but by that time we had advanced again, and Toddles was blowing"
5016,A GREAT FIGHT.,"the bugle as hard as he could, which seemed to disconcert the foe."
5017,A GREAT FIGHT.,"Fred took a flying leap from the cannon right over his back, and"
5018,A GREAT FIGHT.,"putting himself at our head, rallied us for a grand charge. We rushed"
5019,A GREAT FIGHT.,"forward, driving the enemy before us. A panic seized him, and he fled"
5020,A GREAT FIGHT.,"in disorder; we pursued him as far as the fence, and he got through a"
5021,A GREAT FIGHT.,"hole and escaped, but not before we each had a good whack at him. It"
5022,A GREAT FIGHT.,was a glorious victory! Fred made us a speech afterward from the top of
5023,A GREAT FIGHT.,"the cannon, and we all waved everything we had to wave, and vowed to"
5024,A GREAT FIGHT.,slay the invader if ever he dared to show his nose on our side of the
5025,A GREAT FIGHT.,fence again.
5026,A GREAT FIGHT.,
5027,A GREAT FIGHT.,So that was all!

5040,HALLELUJAH!,"On a bench under one of the leafless trees in the park sat an old man,"
5041,HALLELUJAH!,"gray-haired and poorly clad. His eyes were fixed on the ground, and he"
5042,HALLELUJAH!,was thinking of many sorrowful things. Suddenly he heard a little clear
5043,HALLELUJAH!,"voice saying, “Didn’t they give you any flowers?”"
5044,HALLELUJAH!,
5045,HALLELUJAH!,"He looked up and saw a little wee girl standing before him, with her"

5047,HALLELUJAH!,and a little round rosebud of a mouth; and she was looking at him very
5048,HALLELUJAH!,seriously indeed. “Didn’t they give you any flowers?” she repeated.
5049,HALLELUJAH!,
5050,HALLELUJAH!,"“No, dear,” said the old man, gently; “nobody gave me any flowers."
5051,HALLELUJAH!,Where did you get your pretty posies?”
5052,HALLELUJAH!,
5053,HALLELUJAH!,"“In church, of course,” said the child. “The minister gives us all"
5054,HALLELUJAH!,"flowers. You shall have some of mine,” and she took some sprays of lily"
5055,HALLELUJAH!,of the valley and a red rose and laid them in the old man’s withered
5056,HALLELUJAH!,"hand. “Does that make you glad?” she asked, anxiously. “The minister"
5057,HALLELUJAH!,says everybody _must_ be glad to-day.”
5058,HALLELUJAH!,
5059,HALLELUJAH!,"“Why must everybody be glad, my little angel?” asked the old man, sadly."
5060,HALLELUJAH!,
5061,HALLELUJAH!,"“Because Christ the Lord is risen,” said the child. “Didn’t you know"
5062,HALLELUJAH!,that? Don’t you know that this is Easter Day?”
5063,HALLELUJAH!,
5064,HALLELUJAH!,"The old man smiled, and raised the flowers to his lips and kissed"
5065,HALLELUJAH!,"them. “I have been ill, my little angel,” he said, “but you have made"
5066,HALLELUJAH!,"me almost well again, and I _will_ be glad! Christ the Lord is risen"
5067,HALLELUJAH!,indeed.”
5068,HALLELUJAH!,
5069,HALLELUJAH!,"“Hallelujah!” cried the child, eagerly."

5101,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5102,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,“How?” queried Ben and Kitty.
5103,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5104,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“Why, it’s just—just to _be_ merry!” replied Wilfrid, loftily. “No"
5105,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"matter what happens, all day long, we must laugh. If you fall down"
5106,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"stairs, Ben, as you did yesterday, instead of howling, just laugh!"
5107,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,You’ll see—ow! this potato is awfully hot. I’ve burned my finger like
5108,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,fun.”
5109,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5110,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“Ha! ha! ha!” shouted Ben and Kitty, as loud as they could."
5111,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5112,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“What are you laughing at, I should like to know?” cried their brother,"
5113,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,looking up rather savagely from the finger he was nursing. “I don’t see

5115,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5116,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,“Merry Christmas!” cried Ben.
5117,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5118,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“We are laughing ’cause you told us to, Willy!” said Kitty. “Oh, isn’t"
5119,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"it funny, brother burned his finger! Why don’t you laugh, too, Willy?”"
5120,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5121,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,Wilfrid was silent a moment; then he gave a forced laugh. “Of course!”
5122,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"he said, glancing rather sheepishly in the direction of Papa, who sat"
5123,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"quiet behind his newspaper, and appeared to be taking no notice. (“But"
5124,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"you never can tell whether he really is or not,” he reflected.) “Of"
5125,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"course! I didn’t say I should laugh if _you_ hurt yourselves, children,"
5126,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"but it’s all right. You see I laugh, though I really hurt myself _very"
5127,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"much indeed_” (with another glance at Papa)! “Come, now! what shall we"
5128,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,play till it’s time to get ready for church? I vote for ‘Old Man I’m
5129,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"on your Castle!’ We can play right on the hearth-rug here, and I’ll be"
5130,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,‘Old Man.’”
5131,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5132,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,“I want to be ‘Old Man!’” protested little Kitty. “You’s always ‘Old
5133,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Man,’ Willy!”"
5134,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5135,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“’Cause I’m the oldest!” responded her brother, promptly. “Come on,"
5136,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Kitty, and laugh, you know! Don’t look as if I had trodden on your toes"
5137,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,just because you want to be ‘Old Man.’ We must laugh all the more when
5138,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"we don’t get the things we want, don’t you see?”"
5139,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5140,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"The game went on merrily, and all three were laughing with right"
5141,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"good-will, when Wilfred caught his foot in a corner of the rug and"
5142,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"fell, striking his head pretty sharply against the table. He was dazed"
5143,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"for a moment, but as the children’s laughter rang out, he started to"
5144,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,his feet with looks of fury.
5145,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5146,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“You hateful little things!” he began, crimson with rage."
5147,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5148,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,But at this moment another laugh was heard. Papa put down his newspaper
5149,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"and began, “Ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! this is Merry Christmas, indeed!"
5150,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Why don’t you laugh, Wilfrid, my boy? Ho! ho! this is remarkably funny."
5151,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"Why don’t you laugh? Why, this is the best joke I have heard to-day. Go"
5152,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"to your mother, dear, and ask her to put some arnica on your head, but"
5153,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,don’t forget to laugh all the way.”
5154,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,
5155,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"“That is the worst of Papa,” said Wilfrid to himself, as he went slowly"
5156,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,"up stairs, rubbing his head, and casting baleful glances at the two"
5157,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,little laughing children.
5158,MERRY CHRISTMAS.,

5166,THE LITTLE DOG WITH THE GREEN TAIL.,
5167,AN UNTRUE STORY.,AN UNTRUE STORY.
5168,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5169,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5170,AN UNTRUE STORY.,ONCE upon a time there came to the town where all the little dogs live
5171,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"a strange little dog, whose tail was of a most beautiful bright green"
5172,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"color,—so bright that it shone like an emerald. Now, when all the other"
5173,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"little dogs saw this, they were filled with admiration and envy, and"
5174,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"they ran to the strange little dog and said,—"
5175,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5176,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"“Oh, little dog! what makes your tail so beautifully green? Pray tell"
5177,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"us, that we may make ours green too, for we never saw anything so"
5178,AN UNTRUE STORY.,lovely in all our lives.”
5179,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5180,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But the strange little dog laughed and said, “There are many things"
5181,AN UNTRUE STORY.,greener than my tail. There is the grass down in the meadow; go and ask
5182,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"that what makes it green, and perhaps it will tell you.”"
5183,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5184,AN UNTRUE STORY.,So all the little dogs ran down into the meadow where the grass was
5185,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"growing, and they said, “Oh, grass, grass! what makes you so green?"
5186,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"Pray tell us, that we may all get green tails, like the tail of the"
5187,AN UNTRUE STORY.,strange little dog.”
5188,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5189,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But all the little blades of grass shook their heads, and said, “We can"
5190,AN UNTRUE STORY.,tell you nothing about that. All we know is that we were down under the
5191,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"ground last winter, and that when we came up this spring, we were all"
5192,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"green. You might try that, and perhaps it would make you green, too.”"
5193,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5194,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"So all the little dogs went to work as fast as they could, and dug"
5195,AN UNTRUE STORY.,holes in the ground; and then they got into them and covered themselves
5196,AN UNTRUE STORY.,up with earth. But they very soon found they could not breathe; so
5197,AN UNTRUE STORY.,they were all obliged to come up again. And when they looked at each
5198,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"other, they saw to their sorrow that they were not green at all, but"
5199,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"just the same colours that they were before,—some black, some brown,"
5200,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"and some spotted. Then they all went again to the little dog, and said,—"
5201,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5202,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"“Oh, little dog, little dog! we have been to the grass, and it has"
5203,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"not helped us at all. Now, do please tell us what makes your tail so"
5204,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"beautifully green, for we never can be happy till ours are like it.”"
5205,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5206,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But the strange little dog only laughed again and answered, “My tail"
5207,AN UNTRUE STORY.,is not the only green thing in the world. There are the leaves on the
5208,AN UNTRUE STORY.,great oak-tree; they are very green indeed. Go ask them what makes them
5209,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"so, and perhaps they will tell you.”"
5210,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5211,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"So all the little dogs ran as fast as they could to the great oak-tree,"
5212,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"and called out to the little leaves, “Oh, little leaves! what makes you"
5213,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"so beautifully green? Do tell us, that we may all get green tails, like"
5214,AN UNTRUE STORY.,the tail of the strange little dog.”
5215,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5216,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But the leaves all shook their heads, and said, “We know nothing about"
5217,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"that. We came out of our buds last spring, and then we were very pale."
5218,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But we danced about, and the more we danced the greener we grew."
5219,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"Perhaps if you come up here and dance, you will grow green, too.”"
5220,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5221,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"So all the little dogs climbed up the tree as fast as they could, and"
5222,AN UNTRUE STORY.,tried to dance about on the branches. But they were not fastened on
5223,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"like the little leaves, so they fell down and hurt themselves very"
5224,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"much; and when they got up and looked at each other, they were not any"
5225,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"greener than before. So then they all cried bitterly, and they ran once"
5226,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"more to the strange little dog, and said, “Oh, little dog, little dog!"
5227,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"we have tried the way that the leaves told us, and we have only hurt"
5228,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"ourselves dreadfully, and have not got green at all. And now, if you"
5229,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"do not tell us, we shall die of grief, for we never can rest again"
5230,AN UNTRUE STORY.,till our tails are green.”
5231,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5232,AN UNTRUE STORY.,[Illustration]
5233,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5234,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"But the strange little dog only laughed more than ever, and said, “What"
5235,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"stupid creatures you are, to think that there is nothing green in the"
5236,AN UNTRUE STORY.,world except my tail. There is the Sea; he is twenty times as green as
5237,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"my tail. Go and ask him, and he will surely tell you all about it, for"
5238,AN UNTRUE STORY.,he is very wise and knows everything.”
5239,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5240,AN UNTRUE STORY.,So all the little dogs ran as fast as they could down to the shore;
5241,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"and there was the great hungry Sea, prowling up and down, twirling his"
5242,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"white moustaches and tossing his white hair, and looking very green and"
5243,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"very fierce. The little dogs were very much frightened, but they took"
5244,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"courage when they thought of the beautiful green tail, and they said,"
5245,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"trembling,—"
5246,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5247,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"“Oh, great Sea! the strange little dog told us that you were wise and"
5248,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"knew everything, and that you would tell us how to make our tails green"
5249,AN UNTRUE STORY.,like his.”
5250,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5251,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"The great Sea smiled, wickedly, and answered, “Oh, yes, my children,"
5252,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"I can tell you! I am green myself, and I make everything green that"
5253,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"touches me. So let me take you in my arms a moment, and you will become"
5254,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"beautifully green, just like me.”"
5255,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5256,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"So the great hungry Sea held out his long, green arms, and beckoned to"
5257,AN UNTRUE STORY.,them with his white hands; and the poor little dogs all shut their eyes
5258,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"and jumped in, and in less than a minute the Sea gobbled them all up,"
5259,AN UNTRUE STORY.,so that not one was left. And there was an end of all the little dogs.
5260,AN UNTRUE STORY.,
5261,AN UNTRUE STORY.,"And the strange little dog went back to the place he came from, with"
5262,AN UNTRUE STORY.,his green tail curled up behind him; and he was never seen or heard of

5302,HARD TIMES.,
5303,HARD TIMES.,"“Wait and see! and come out into the woods with me this afternoon,"
5304,HARD TIMES.,that’s a good boy!”
5305,HARD TIMES.,
5306,HARD TIMES.,It was about a month before Christmas when this conversation took
5307,HARD TIMES.,place; and all through December there were no busier young people
5308,HARD TIMES.,in Woodville than Fred and Edith Brown. They slighted none of their
5309,HARD TIMES.,"lessons; but Fred spent a good part of his home time in the barn, with"
5310,HARD TIMES.,a hammer in his hand and a Latin grammar at his elbow; while Edith’s
5311,HARD TIMES.,knitting needles flew as she bent over her history lesson. The day
5312,HARD TIMES.,"before Christmas, Papa and Mamma were summoned to dine and spend the"
5313,HARD TIMES.,day with Grandmamma. Mamma rather wondered that the children were not
5314,HARD TIMES.,"invited, and did not want to go without them; but their faces grew so"
5315,HARD TIMES.,"direfully long at this suggestion that she saw through the little plot,"
5316,HARD TIMES.,"though Papa did not, and she cheerfully took her shawl and departed,"
5317,HARD TIMES.,"charging Edith to keep up the fire, and Fred to take care of the house."
5318,HARD TIMES.,
5319,HARD TIMES.,When the parents returned in the evening the house was a bower of
5320,HARD TIMES.,"green. “Here is one thing that costs nothing!” Edith had said, “and"
5321,HARD TIMES.,it is half of a merry Christmas.” So she and Fred had brought great
5322,HARD TIMES.,"armfuls of fragrant cedar and hemlock, and tall fir saplings, which"
5323,HARD TIMES.,"were set up in every corner, while wreaths hung in the windows, and"
5324,HARD TIMES.,long garlands festooned fireplace and picture frames. Papa looked very
5325,HARD TIMES.,"much pleased. “Why, it is Christmas already!” he said. “And I thought"
5326,HARD TIMES.,we should not have any celebration at all this year. You were too
5327,HARD TIMES.,"bright for me, children.”"
5328,HARD TIMES.,
5329,HARD TIMES.,"“It’s all Edith, Papa!” said honest Fred."
5330,HARD TIMES.,
5331,HARD TIMES.,"“All but about two-thirds, Papa!” said Edith. “I could have done"
5332,HARD TIMES.,nothing without Fred’s strong arms.”
5333,HARD TIMES.,
5334,HARD TIMES.,"Next morning the sun was out, and the snow sparkled like diamonds in"
5335,HARD TIMES.,"the golden light. “Here is something else that costs nothing, Edie!”"
5336,HARD TIMES.,"cried Fred, who had entered heart and soul into his sister’s idea."
5337,HARD TIMES.,"“Sunshine is a pretty good present, isn’t it? And we have the very best"
5338,HARD TIMES.,article to-day.”
5339,HARD TIMES.,
5340,HARD TIMES.,"“Hurrah!” cried Edith, “this is glorious. Merry Christmas, boy! Smiles"
5341,HARD TIMES.,"are another thing, Fred. Let’s be sure not to look gloomy for a single"
5342,HARD TIMES.,minute all day.”
5343,HARD TIMES.,
5344,HARD TIMES.,“All right!” said Fred. “I’ll grin like the Cheshire cat from morning
5345,HARD TIMES.,"till night. Now, here’s mother’s work-table, all ready. It has taken a"
5346,HARD TIMES.,"good polish, hasn’t it?”"
5347,HARD TIMES.,
5348,HARD TIMES.,“Splendid!” cried Edith. “And here’s father’s portfolio. Do you
5349,HARD TIMES.,"recognize the cover, Fred?”"
5350,HARD TIMES.,
5351,HARD TIMES.,"“Looks like that pretty dress you had ever so long ago, when you were a"
5352,HARD TIMES.,"little shaver,—I mean shaveress!”"
5353,HARD TIMES.,
5354,HARD TIMES.,"“Just what it is! The pieces were folded away all this time, of no"
5355,HARD TIMES.,use to anybody. And there was enough to make this pretty work-bag for
5356,HARD TIMES.,"mother, and another like it for Aunt May. And,—look here, Fred! Merry"
5357,HARD TIMES.,"Christmas, dear old fellow!”"
5358,HARD TIMES.,
5359,HARD TIMES.,Fred looked at the blue and gray toboggan cap with astonishment and
5360,HARD TIMES.,"delight. “Oh, Sis, that is a stunner! But, I say! you have broken the"
5361,HARD TIMES.,"rule. This wool must have cost you something, and a good deal.”"
5362,HARD TIMES.,
5363,HARD TIMES.,"“Not a penny!” rejoined his sister, triumphantly. “Do you remember that"
5364,HARD TIMES.,huge old comforter that Aunt Eliza sent me three years ago? I never
5365,HARD TIMES.,"could wear it out, though it was just as dear and kind of her to make"
5366,HARD TIMES.,"it for me. That gave me the wool for the cap, and for several other"
5367,HARD TIMES.,things beside.”
5368,HARD TIMES.,
5369,HARD TIMES.,"“Well, it is a beauty!” said Fred. “Here’s all the present I have for"
5370,HARD TIMES.,"you, and I wish it was a better one.” He produced a birchbark basket,"
5371,HARD TIMES.,"filled with chestnuts and hickories, and was rewarded by a good"
5372,HARD TIMES.,old-fashioned hug.
5373,HARD TIMES.,
5374,HARD TIMES.,“As if you could have found anything I should have liked better!”
5375,HARD TIMES.,"cried Edith. “Such beauties, too! Why, you must have picked out every"
5376,HARD TIMES.,"single nut, Fred Brown!”"
5377,HARD TIMES.,
5378,HARD TIMES.,“Something like it!” admitted Fred.
5379,HARD TIMES.,
5380,HARD TIMES.,“How about those partridges for dinner?”
5381,HARD TIMES.,
5382,HARD TIMES.,“They are all ready to put in the oven!” Edith said. “Mother knows
5383,HARD TIMES.,"nothing about them yet, but is sighing a little because she has no"
5384,HARD TIMES.,chicken for us. And you know Mrs. Spicer gave me a jar of mince-meat
5385,HARD TIMES.,"for the cranberries I brought her. I am a little proud of my pie, Fred!”"
5386,HARD TIMES.,
5387,HARD TIMES.,“Hurrah for you!” said Fred.
5388,HARD TIMES.,
5389,HARD TIMES.,Somehow or other the Browns had never had a merrier Christmas than this
5390,HARD TIMES.,one of the hard winter. Edith said it was all the sunshine and the
5391,HARD TIMES.,"green boughs; Fred said it was all Edith; but Mr. and Mrs. Brown, as"
5392,HARD TIMES.,"they sat by the cheerful hearth, and watched the chestnuts roasting,"
5393,HARD TIMES.,"and listened to the merry young voices, gave reverent thanks for their"
5394,HARD TIMES.,"treasure of love, and felt that they were rich in spite of the hard"
5395,HARD TIMES.,times.

5460,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"This is what I did when I went there, and you shall hear what I saw."
5461,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5462,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"On entering the house, I found myself in a large hall hung with gold"
5463,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"and silver paper, and glittering with an incomparable brightness. Here"
5464,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"were hundreds of little cupids with tiny wings, who were running and"
5465,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"flying about, as busy as bees."
5466,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5467,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,One was carrying a roll of gold paper as big as himself; another was
5468,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,painting beautiful flowers on white paper; others were making paper
5469,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,lace. But all seemed to be helping and waiting on a person who sat by a
5470,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"huge table at the farther end of the hall, and this person I soon found"
5471,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,to be Saint Valentine himself.
5472,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5473,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"He was a young man, and very handsome. He was dressed in sky-blue"
5474,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"velvet, embroidered with gold, and had great fat pearls for buttons. He"
5475,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"seemed as busy as the rest, and merely nodded and smiled when he saw"
5476,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"me, and called out,—"
5477,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5478,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"“Number Three Shears,"
5479,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"Approach, my dears!”"
5480,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5481,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"I heard a queer, sharp voice at my elbow, saying, “Now, then, by your"
5482,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"leave!” and turning, saw at my elbow an enormous pair of shears,"
5483,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"walking about on two legs, and looking as proud as you please."
5484,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5485,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"“Dear Number Threes,"
5486,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"A million sevens, if you please!”"
5487,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5488,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,said Saint Valentine.
5489,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5490,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"Snip-snap! snip-snap! went the shears, and there lay a million little"
5491,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,sheets of white paper.
5492,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5493,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"Then the Saint cried,—"

5498,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"and a dozen cupids came up, dragging a great basket full of hearts, and"
5499,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"carrying bundles of darts under their arms. Quick as lightning, Saint"
5500,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"Valentine took a couple of hearts out of the basket, clapped them on a"
5501,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"sheet of paper, stuck a dart into them, flung a wreath of flowers round"
5502,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"them, then, thump! a great stamp came down on the paper, and out of it"
5503,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,came a lovely valentine.
5504,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5505,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"That was quick work! in five minutes, I should think, five hundred"
5506,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,valentines were turned out. I stood looking on in delight.

5516,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,
5517,SAINT VALENTINE’S HOUSE.,"“Now if you will venture in it,"

5531,THE GENTLEMAN.,He kissed his hand to each child.
5532,THE GENTLEMAN.,"He smiled and he bowed to meek and proud,"

5539,THE GENTLEMAN.,"A-walking he went in a lane one day,—"
5540,THE GENTLEMAN.,A lane that was long and narrow;
5541,THE GENTLEMAN.,"And there in the path a rustic lay,"
5542,THE GENTLEMAN.,Beside his plough and harrow.
5543,THE GENTLEMAN.,"A ruffian and a gruffian he,"
5544,THE GENTLEMAN.,A horrid rustic for to see:

5547,THE GENTLEMAN.,
5548,THE GENTLEMAN.,"“I pray you, worthy friend, to rise!”"
5549,THE GENTLEMAN.,The gentleman mildly said;

5551,THE GENTLEMAN.,And shook his ugly head.
5552,THE GENTLEMAN.,"“The ditch is wide on either side,"
5553,THE GENTLEMAN.,"And dry enough,” quoth he;"

5557,THE GENTLEMAN.,[Illustration]

5559,THE GENTLEMAN.,"The gentleman smiled a charming smile,"
5560,THE GENTLEMAN.,And bowed a gracious bow;

5562,THE GENTLEMAN.,He spied a grazing cow.
5563,THE GENTLEMAN.,"“As sure as I live, a lesson I’ll give,”"
5564,THE GENTLEMAN.,"Thought he, “to my rustic friend."
5565,THE GENTLEMAN.,I’ll warrant me yet he’ll not forget
5566,THE GENTLEMAN.,This day to his life’s long end.”
5567,THE GENTLEMAN.,
5568,THE GENTLEMAN.,The rustic lay in the path and snored;
5569,THE GENTLEMAN.,The cow ate grass and lowed;
5570,THE GENTLEMAN.,"The gentleman took her and gently shook her,"
5571,THE GENTLEMAN.,And led her along the road.
5572,THE GENTLEMAN.,"Then he took a string, and an iron ring,"
5573,THE GENTLEMAN.,"And the end of the cow’s loose tether,"
5574,THE GENTLEMAN.,"And harrow and plough and ruffian and cow,"

5583,THE GENTLEMAN.,"He pulled a switch from the wayside ditch,"
5584,THE GENTLEMAN.,"Gave Moolly a sounding blow,"

5607,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“Why, to-morrow, Silly!” said Robby."
5608,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,

5610,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5611,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“I don’t mean _that_!” said little Bobby, who was not yet four. “I"
5612,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"mean, what is our birfday? Is it good to eat?”"
5613,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5614,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“Why! why-ee! Bobby Bell! Don’t you have birthdays?” cried Robby,"
5615,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,opening his eyes.
5616,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5617,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“No!” said Bobby, opening his mouth. “I neber saw one.”"
5618,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5619,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“You don’t _see_ them!” said Robby, in a patronizing tone, “you _have_"
5620,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"them! It is the day you were born, and you have a party and presents,"
5621,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"and a birthday cake with frosting, and your name on it in pink letters,"
5622,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"and candy and oranges, and a gold dollar with Grandmamma’s love to her"
5623,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"dear little boy. Do you _really mean_ that you never had one, Bobby"
5624,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,Bell?”
5625,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5626,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,Little Bobby looked very grave. “Perhaps I wasn’t born!” he said. “I’s
5627,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,going to ask Mamma.” So he trotted in to his mother.
5628,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5629,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“Mamma,” he said, “was I born?”"
5630,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5631,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Mamma looked at him a moment in mute surprise. “Were you born, dear?”"
5632,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"she repeated. “Yes, certainly you were born. Why do you ask me that,"
5633,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,little boy?”
5634,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5635,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Bobby’s lip began to quiver, and his blue eyes filled with tears. “Den"
5636,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"why,—why don’t I have birfdays?” he asked."
5637,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5638,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,Mamma looked very sorry. “Dear! dear!” she said. “Now who has been
5639,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,telling my leap year boy about birthdays? Come and sit in Mamma’s lap
5640,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"and tell me all about it, and then I will tell _you_ all about it.”"
5641,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5642,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"So Bobby climbed up into Mamma’s lap and hid his face in her dress,"
5643,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"and sobbed out his little story about frosted cake and pink letters,"
5644,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,and gold dollars with Grandmamma’s love to her dear little boy. “And I
5645,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"neber—I neber had _any_!” he said, piteously."
5646,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5647,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Then Mamma told Bobby a funny little story. It was about the years, and"
5648,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"it told how they came along, one after another, and how each year had"
5649,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,just the same number of days in it.
5650,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5651,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,“Three—hundred—and sixty-five!
5652,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,So many days I’ve been alive.
5653,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Storm and shine, and sorrow and cheer,"
5654,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Really, there never _was_ such a year!”"
5655,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5656,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,That is what each one says before it puts on its nightcap and goes to
5657,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,sleep.
5658,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5659,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,But every _fourth_ year there comes one who is bigger than the rest. He
5660,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"has one day more, and he is very proud of it, and holds his head very"
5661,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"high, and says,—"
5662,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5663,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,“Three—hundred—and sixty-_six_!
5664,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,One _more day_ for frolicsome tricks.
5665,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,One day more for work and for play.
5666,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,Look at me! look at me! _One_ MORE DAY!!!”
5667,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5668,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“And so four years ago,” said Mamma, “there came one of these extra"
5669,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"days, and it was the very best day that any year ever brought, for on"
5670,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,that day my Bobby was born! Think of that!”
5671,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5672,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,Bobby laughed and clapped his little fat hands.
5673,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5674,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"“And so,” continued Mamma, “of course my Bobby couldn’t have another"
5675,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"birthday till another long year came round, with another extra day. And"
5676,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"now,—whisper, Bobby! now the long year _has_ come, and next Friday is"
5677,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"your birthday, dear, and you are going to have—oh! but I mustn’t tell!”"
5678,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,
5679,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"Mamma laughed and shook her head, and didn’t tell any more, but her"
5680,A LEAP YEAR BOY.,"eyes told a great deal; and that was all Bobby wanted, for he was very"

5742,THE STORY OF THE CRIMSON CRAB.,"she did not wish to marry the Eldest Frog. He was gray and grizzly, had"

5929,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5930,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5931,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"ONCE upon a time there were some children, and once upon a time there"
5932,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"were some ducks. It was upon the same time, too, and they all lived"
5933,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"together in one house. That was funny, wasn’t it?"
5934,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5935,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"And there were two reasons for it. In the first place, it was so cold"
5936,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"where they lived that the ducks could not stay out of doors, except"
5937,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"in summer; and in the second place, the good man of the house, the"
5938,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"children’s father, was so poor that he could not afford to have a"
5939,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,separate house for the ducks.
5940,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5941,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Indeed, there were only three rooms in the house. One was the kitchen,"
5942,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"which was parlor and dining-room and sitting-room as well, and one was"
5943,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"the children’s room, and the third was the parents’ room. So there"
5944,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"they all lived together, and they were very sociable. The names of the"
5945,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"children were Greta, Minna, Lisa, Carl and Baby Fritz. The names of"
5946,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"the ducks were Red-top, Waggle-tail, Gobbler and Spottle-toe; and the"
5947,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"children were all good, but the ducks were all naughty, as you shall"
5948,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,hear.
5949,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5950,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"The father had made a nice wooden box for the ducks, and this was"
5951,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,always filled with hay and kept beside the great porcelain stove in
5952,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"winter, so that the pets might be warm. But were they grateful for"
5953,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,this kindness? Not a bit of it. They were always getting out of their
5954,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,box and poking their bills into all sorts of places where they had
5955,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,no business to be. You might find Waggle-tail inside the mother’s
5956,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Sunday cap, and Gobbler tasting the soup on the table, and Red-top and"
5957,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,Spottle-toe pulling the baby’s doll to pieces. These were things that
5958,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"happened every day. And, indeed, what else can be expected, when one"
5959,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,keeps one’s ducks in the kitchen? But one day something very much worse
5960,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,than all this came.
5961,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5962,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"The mother was ill, so ill that she was obliged to stay in bed and send"
5963,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"for the doctor, and that was something very unusual. The doctor came"
5964,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"and gave her a box of pills, telling her to take one every day until"
5965,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"she was better. He told her to put her feet in a hot mustard-bath,"
5966,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,as that would draw the pain down from her head; then he patted the
5967,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"children, and mounting his old gray pony, rode away again."
5968,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5969,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Well, the mother took her pill, and then closed her eyes for a short"
5970,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"nap, laying the pill-box down on the low stool beside the bed."
5971,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Presently Greta, the eldest daughter, came in with the hot foot-bath,"
5972,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"and seeing her mother asleep, set it down softly and went out again to"
5973,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,get the warm shawl that the good woman would need when she sat up.
5974,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5975,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Now, it happened that she left the door open, and as this was what the"
5976,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"four ducks had been waiting for all day, they immediately waddled into"
5977,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"the mother’s room. Poking about in their usual way, they soon found the"
5978,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"box of pills, and supposing them to be something particularly nice,"
5979,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"they gobbled them all up in the twinkling of an eye. Now, you know that"
5980,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"pills are not apt to be nice, and these pills were very particularly"
5981,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"nasty, as the ducks soon found out."
5982,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5983,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,“What’s this?” said Gobbler.
5984,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5985,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,“Ugh! quack! ugh! What is it?” exclaimed Red-top.
5986,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5987,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Waggle-tail had swallowed four pills, and his feelings were too deep"
5988,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,for words. His one thought was “something to drink!” and seeing the
5989,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"foot-bath, he plunged his bill in and took a good draught of the hot"
5990,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,mustard and water.
5991,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,
5992,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"Oh, then, what a clamour arose! The other ducks had hastened to follow"
5993,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"his example, and now they were all screaming and sputtering and"
5994,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,flapping their wings in a way that was dreadful to hear. The poor
5995,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,mother woke up in a fright; Greta and all the children came rushing
5996,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"in, followed by the dog; finally the father came, armed with a heavy"
5997,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"stick, and the terrified ducks were driven out of doors, where they"
5998,THE INQUISITIVE DUCKS.,"sat, shivering, on the doorstep, declaring that they would never eat or"

6104,POOR BONNY.,
6105,A TRUE STORY.,A TRUE STORY.
6106,A TRUE STORY.,
6107,A TRUE STORY.,
6108,A TRUE STORY.,"BONNY was only six years old when it happened. He went to the mill, one"
6109,A TRUE STORY.,"day, with his uncle, riding in front of him on the old gray mare, while"
6110,A TRUE STORY.,the bags of corn hung over on each side.
6111,A TRUE STORY.,
6112,A TRUE STORY.,"While Uncle Allen talked with the miller, Bonny ran about, peeping here"
6113,A TRUE STORY.,and there; and at last he strayed off into the pasture to see the red
6114,A TRUE STORY.,calf with the three spots on its nose. He was gone so long that Uncle
6115,A TRUE STORY.,"Allen thought he had run away home, so he rode off with two bags of"
6116,A TRUE STORY.,flour instead of the corn.
6117,A TRUE STORY.,
6118,A TRUE STORY.,Bonny was rather frightened when he found he must go home alone through
6119,A TRUE STORY.,"the woods, a distance of three miles, but he was a sturdy little"
6120,A TRUE STORY.,"fellow, and would not let the miller know that he was afraid."
6121,A TRUE STORY.,
6122,A TRUE STORY.,"Off he trudged, with his hands in his pockets, whistling the merriest"
6123,A TRUE STORY.,"tune he knew, to keep his courage up,—“Tra la lira la!” Very gayly it"
6124,A TRUE STORY.,"sounded through the bare woods, for it was early spring, and the leaves"
6125,A TRUE STORY.,were only just beginning to break out of their woolly coverings. The
6126,A TRUE STORY.,"red squirrels came out of their holes to look at him, and the little"
6127,A TRUE STORY.,wood-mice sat and chattered at the doors of their houses. Bonny was
6128,A TRUE STORY.,"used to these little creatures, and only whistled louder when he saw"
6129,A TRUE STORY.,them; but presently he came to something that made him stop whistling
6130,A TRUE STORY.,and open his mouth very wide indeed with surprise.
6131,A TRUE STORY.,
6132,A TRUE STORY.,"On the stump of a fallen tree sat a great bird with mottled feathers,"
6133,A TRUE STORY.,"which spread around and over the stump. It was a wild turkey, Bonny"
6134,A TRUE STORY.,"knew, for Uncle Allen had told him just what they looked like, though"
6135,A TRUE STORY.,he had never seen one.
6136,A TRUE STORY.,
6137,A TRUE STORY.,"When the turkey saw him, she rose up for a moment, and he saw that she"
6138,A TRUE STORY.,"was sitting on a nest full of brown eggs. Then she settled down again,"
6139,A TRUE STORY.,"folded her wings over her treasure, and glared fiercely at the intruder."
6140,A TRUE STORY.,
6141,A TRUE STORY.,"Bonny stood quite still for some time, wondering what he should do. He"
6142,A TRUE STORY.,"wanted the eggs,—not all, but just a few, to show Uncle Allen. But the"
6143,A TRUE STORY.,"turkey was very large and very fierce-looking, with her glaring, yellow"
6144,A TRUE STORY.,eyes and her sharp beak; and Bonny was only six years old.
6145,A TRUE STORY.,
6146,A TRUE STORY.,"On the whole, he thought the wisest plan would be to go straight home"
6147,A TRUE STORY.,and tell Uncle Allen about it; and then they would come together and
6148,A TRUE STORY.,"drive the turkey away, and get a few of the beautiful mottled egg."
6149,A TRUE STORY.,
6150,A TRUE STORY.,"Full of his new idea, the little fellow ran on, and finally reached"
6151,A TRUE STORY.,"home before dark. But here a sad disappointment awaited him, for Uncle"
6152,A TRUE STORY.,"Allen—Bonny had no father or mother, and lived with his uncle—would not"
6153,A TRUE STORY.,believe that he had seen a wild turkey at all.
6154,A TRUE STORY.,
6155,A TRUE STORY.,"“Pooh! pooh!” he said. “Nonsense, my lad! you saw a partridge; or it"
6156,A TRUE STORY.,"might be a hen that had stolen a nest, as the saying is. There are no"
6157,A TRUE STORY.,"wild turkeys about here that ever I heard of. Get your supper now, and"
6158,A TRUE STORY.,"go to bed, like a good little lad. We have had a fine worry about you,"
6159,A TRUE STORY.,thinking you were lost.”
6160,A TRUE STORY.,
6161,A TRUE STORY.,"Bonny _knew_ it was a wild turkey that he had seen, and he was very"
6162,A TRUE STORY.,unhappy because his story was only half believed.
6163,A TRUE STORY.,
6164,A TRUE STORY.,"“If I could only have got an egg!” he said to himself, over and over."
6165,A TRUE STORY.,"“If I had only one egg to show, they would know that I am right. But I"
6166,A TRUE STORY.,"know it! I do! I do!” He ate his supper, and went to bed with his head"
6167,A TRUE STORY.,"full of the wild turkey, but he was so tired that he fell asleep in"
6168,A TRUE STORY.,spite of himself.
6169,A TRUE STORY.,
6170,A TRUE STORY.,It seemed as if Bonny had only been asleep five minutes when something
6171,A TRUE STORY.,"struck him very hard on the head, and woke him up. He cried out, and"
6172,A TRUE STORY.,opened his eyes in a great fright. Where was he? Why was he so cold?
6173,A TRUE STORY.,Why were his feet wet?
6174,A TRUE STORY.,
6175,A TRUE STORY.,At first the child was bewildered with fright and amazement; but when
6176,A TRUE STORY.,"he came to himself, he found that he was standing in the midst of a"
6177,A TRUE STORY.,"wood, alone, barefooted, clad only in his little flannel nightgown, in"
6178,A TRUE STORY.,the dead of night.
6179,A TRUE STORY.,
6180,A TRUE STORY.,Poor Bonny! poor little lad! And what was he holding up in his
6181,A TRUE STORY.,"nightgown, holding tight with both hands? He let go his hold, and down"
6182,A TRUE STORY.,fell—the wild turkey’s eggs!
6183,A TRUE STORY.,
6184,A TRUE STORY.,"The child had walked there in his sleep, and had found the bird gone,"
6185,A TRUE STORY.,"or else driven her away, he never could know which. As he raised his"
6186,A TRUE STORY.,"head after gathering up the eggs, a branch must have struck him on the"
6187,A TRUE STORY.,head and waked him.
6188,A TRUE STORY.,
6189,A TRUE STORY.,"But oh, to get home! It was so cold, so wet! He shivered with fear,"
6190,A TRUE STORY.,as well as with the chill; but this time he would not go back
6191,A TRUE STORY.,"empty-handed. Surely, the eggs could not be _all_ broken?"
6192,A TRUE STORY.,
6193,A TRUE STORY.,"No, here was one whole one! Clasp it tight, little Bonny, and run!"
6194,A TRUE STORY.,"Follow your own little footprints, pit-pat, pit-pat, back through the"
6195,A TRUE STORY.,"dark woods,—the moon shining through the trees, and making just enough"
6196,A TRUE STORY.,"light for you to see your way,—across the meadow, up the lane and"
6197,A TRUE STORY.,"then,—oh! then scamper, run! rush over the home-field, home! home at"
6198,A TRUE STORY.,last!
6199,A TRUE STORY.,
6200,A TRUE STORY.,"Pit-pat, softly, up the back stairs, after closing the door, which he"
6201,A TRUE STORY.,"found swinging wide open, and the little shivering figure crept into"
6202,A TRUE STORY.,"its little bed, cuddled down under the bedclothes and lay as still as a"
6203,A TRUE STORY.,mouse.
6204,A TRUE STORY.,
6205,A TRUE STORY.,Great was the outcry in the morning when Bonny told his story.
6206,A TRUE STORY.,
6207,A TRUE STORY.,“Pooh! pooh! nonsense!” cried Uncle Allen.
6208,A TRUE STORY.,
6209,A TRUE STORY.,"But there was the turkey’s egg, and there were the little muddy"
6210,A TRUE STORY.,footprints at the back door and up the stairs.
6211,A TRUE STORY.,
6212,A TRUE STORY.,"Then Uncle Allen followed the tracks, and went himself across the field"
6213,A TRUE STORY.,and down the lane and over the meadow and through the wood. And when he
6214,A TRUE STORY.,"came to the nest on the stump and the broken eggs, with the print of"
6215,A TRUE STORY.,"the little bare feet close by, he said, “Well, well! I declare! now, I"
6216,A TRUE STORY.,do!”
6217,A TRUE STORY.,
6218,A TRUE STORY.,And he went home and gave Bonny a big orange and ten cents and his old
6219,A TRUE STORY.,"jackknife. But Aunt Lucy kept him in bed till noon, and made him drink"
6220,A TRUE STORY.,hot lemonade every hour to take out the cold; and he had the kitten to
6221,A TRUE STORY.,"play with, and Grandma’s spectacles, and he didn’t catch cold, after"
6222,A TRUE STORY.,all.

6296,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"ONCE upon a time there lived, in a little straw hut, a poor"
6297,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"cheese-maker and his wife. They made good cheeses, and sold them"
6298,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"whenever they could; but they lived in a lonely spot, and few people"
6299,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"passed by that way, so that they made but a slender living. Now it"
6300,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,chanced one day that when the good wife came to count the cheeses she
6301,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"found that there were six missing, although she had not sold any or"
6302,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,given them away.
6303,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6304,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"So she said to her husband,—"
6305,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6306,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“Some thief has stolen six cheeses in the night.”
6307,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6308,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“Good!” said the husband.
6309,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6310,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“Bad!” said the wife.
6311,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6312,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Good, I tell you!” cried the husband. “We will watch to-night and"
6313,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"catch the thief, and to-morrow we will take him before the judge and"
6314,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,ask that he be forced to pay us twice the value of the cheeses.”
6315,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6316,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“Good!” said the wife. “What a clever fellow you are!”
6317,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6318,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Oh! I have not a pumpkin on my shoulders!” said the husband, chuckling."
6319,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6320,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"Accordingly, the husband and wife concealed themselves under the bed"
6321,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the next night, and watched to see what would happen. About midnight"
6322,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the door opened softly, and in came a large brown monkey. He looked all"
6323,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"about, and seeing no one, he went to the cheese cupboard, took three of"
6324,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the finest cheeses, and made off. The wife was for following him, but"
6325,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the husband said, “No! let us wait and see if he comes again.”"
6326,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6327,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"So they waited, and sure enough the monkey returned in a few minutes,"
6328,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,and taking three more cheeses went off again. This time the man
6329,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"followed him. Holding the cheeses carefully in his arms, the monkey"
6330,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"took his way through the woods till he came to the mouth of a cave,"
6331,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,into which he ran. The cheese-maker slipped noiselessly after him. They
6332,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"went through a dark, winding passage, which led to a vaulted chamber"
6333,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"hollowed in the solid rock. Here the monkey entered, while the man"
6334,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,concealed himself behind a point of rock and peeped after him. The
6335,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"room was full of monkeys; and at the farther end sat the Monkey King,"
6336,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,on a throne made of a huge mass of gold. The cheese-maker stared at
6337,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"that, for he had never seen such a sight. When the Monkey King saw the"
6338,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"cheese, he howled with delight, seized the largest one, and gobbled it"
6339,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,up.
6340,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6341,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"When the cheese-maker saw that, he turned about and went home again,"
6342,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"for he needed to see no more, having a head on his shoulders, and not a"
6343,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,pumpkin.
6344,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6345,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“How now?” asked his wife. “You come back without the cheeses?”
6346,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6347,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Hold your tongue, good wife!” he said. “Knowledge is better than"
6348,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,cheese.”
6349,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6350,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Truly!” said the wife, scornfully. “It must be a fine knowledge to be"
6351,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,worth six of my best cheeses.”
6352,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6353,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"The next night the man hid himself behind the door of the hut, and when"
6354,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the monkey-thief appeared, he sprang out and caught him by his long"
6355,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,tail.
6356,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6357,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Here, wife!” he cried, “bring me your shears, that I may cut off this"
6358,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,fellow’s tail for a rope to beat him with.”
6359,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6360,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Ai, ai!” screamed the monkey. “Do not cut off my handsome tail! Spare"
6361,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"me, and I will give you whatever you wish.”"
6362,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6363,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Do you mean it?” asked the cheese-maker, giving the tail a twist."
6364,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6365,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Ai, ai!” said the monkey, “I swear it, upon my honour!”"
6366,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6367,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Then,” said the cheese-maker, “go and bring me a lump of gold from"
6368,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"the king’s throne as big as my fist, and you shall have your freedom"
6369,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,and a cheese besides.”
6370,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6371,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"The monkey, glad to escape so easily, hastened away, and soon returned"
6372,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,with the lump of gold.
6373,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6374,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“What do you want of this yellow stuff?” he asked. “It is only fit to
6375,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,make chairs of.”
6376,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6377,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“Well, I may want to make a chair some day,” replied the cheese-maker."
6378,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"“The door will be locked after this,” he added; “but whenever your"
6379,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"master wants cheese, you know how to get it.”"
6380,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6381,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"It happened, in this way, that the cheese-maker and his wife grew very"
6382,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"rich; for the monkeys constantly came to buy cheese, and they always"
6383,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"paid for it with heavy lumps of gold. Soon the straw hut disappeared,"
6384,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"and in its stead rose a stately house of stone, with gardens and"
6385,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"terraces about it. The cheese-maker wore a velvet coat, and his wife"
6386,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,flaunted about in a satin gown; but still they never failed to make
6387,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,their cheeses twice a week.
6388,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,
6389,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,“Why do you still make cheese?” asked the fine visitors who came to
6390,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"see them, rolling in gilded coaches. But the cheese-maker had one"
6391,THE CLEVER CHEESE-MAKER.,"answer for them all: “Because I have a head on my shoulders, and not a"

6399,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6400,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"THE teacher sat in her high-backed chair,"
6401,THE SPELLING LESSON.,Her chair so straight and tall;
6402,THE SPELLING LESSON.,Her eyes went flashing to and fro
6403,THE SPELLING LESSON.,Among the children small.
6404,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"At last she spoke, and “Billy boy!"
6405,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Now answer, Billy Bolee,"
6406,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"And tell me quickly, what does C-"
6407,THE SPELLING LESSON.,O-W spell?” quoth she.
6408,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6409,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Then up went Patty’s hand,"
6410,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Up went Matty’s hand,"
6411,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Up went Freddy’s hand, too;"
6412,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"But poor little Billy,"
6413,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"He _was_ so silly,"
6414,THE SPELLING LESSON.,He didn’t know what to do.
6415,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6416,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"The teacher smiled her pleasant smile,"
6417,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"And shook her small, wise head."
6418,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"“Be quiet, all! for I am sure"
6419,THE SPELLING LESSON.,That Billy knows!” she said.
6420,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"“Put on your thinking-cap, my child,"
6421,THE SPELLING LESSON.,And tie it very tight;
6422,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Then C-O-W will not trouble you,"
6423,THE SPELLING LESSON.,And you will say it right.”
6424,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6425,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"But up went Patty’s hand,"
6426,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Up went Matty’s hand,"

6431,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6432,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"But when the children ’gan to laugh,"
6433,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"And fun at him ’gan poke,"
6434,THE SPELLING LESSON.,Poor Billy thought it might not be
6435,THE SPELLING LESSON.,So _much_ worse if he spoke.
6436,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"So, lifting up his fearful eyes"
6437,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"All sad and timorously,"
6438,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"“Sure, C-O-W, must spell, _Sobble-you_!”"
6439,THE SPELLING LESSON.,Thus spoke Billy Bolee.
6440,THE SPELLING LESSON.,
6441,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"Then out laughed Matty,"
6442,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"And out laughed Patty,"
6443,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"And out laughed Frederick, too;"
6444,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"But _poor_ little Billy,"
6445,THE SPELLING LESSON.,"He felt so silly,"

6451,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.
6452,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6453,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6454,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,ONCE upon a time there was a Person who did not like cats. She did not
6455,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"like dogs, either, but she never said anything about that, because the"
6456,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,Big Master and the two Little Masters and the four Little Mistresses
6457,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"were all very fond of dogs, and liked to have them lie round under"
6458,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"everybody’s feet and get white hairs all over everybody’s clothes, and"
6459,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"take up the whole hearth-rug and run away with the roast beef, and bark"
6460,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"to be let out and then howl to be let in, and shake themselves when"
6461,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"they were wet, and do all the things that dogs do,—they liked all these"
6462,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"things, so the Person who did not like cats never dared to say a word."
6463,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6464,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,But nobody cared very much about cats—except when they were little
6465,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"downy kittens, and they _will_ not stay kittens!—save Maggie, the cook;"
6466,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"so the Person felt free to speak her mind, and said she would not"
6467,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"have any cats in the house. And after she had said that, these things"
6468,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,happened:
6469,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6470,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,One day a kitten belonging to the neighbour’s little boy came into the
6471,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"kitchen, and refused to go out again. The little boy was sent for, and"
6472,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,he came and took the kitten home.
6473,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6474,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"Next day it came again, and was taken home again. And so it went on for"
6475,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"a week, till every one in the house was tired out with carrying that"
6476,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"kitten home, and the kitten’s little boy cried and thought it was too"
6477,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,bad. It was.
6478,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6479,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"But the kitten was very happy, and Maggie, the cook, said she “couldn’t"
6480,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"let the crathur starve,” so it stayed; and pretty soon it was not a"
6481,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"kitten any more, but a cat, and it had kittens of its own, one of which"
6482,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,was given to the little boy.
6483,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6484,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,Now the Person who did not like cats said the other kittens must be
6485,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,taken away in a bag; but all the Little Masters and Mistresses cried
6486,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"out, and said,—"
6487,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6488,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"“Oh, Mamma!” “Please, Mamma, the dear, sweet little things!” “See their"
6489,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,little paws!” “See their dear little noses!” “Hear them squeal!” “We
6490,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"must keep this one, Mamma!” “We can’t possibly part with that one,"
6491,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"Mamma!” “Oh, Mamma!” “Dear Mamma!” “Feel this one’s little back!” and"
6492,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"so on, and so on."
6493,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6494,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,So the Person said that they might keep the one which they all thought
6495,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"the prettiest, and that the others must go away in a bag; but while"
6496,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"they were deciding, the kittens grew up and became cats. So then the"
6497,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"bag was not big enough to hold them, and they stayed, partly for that"
6498,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"reason, and partly because they were all so ugly that no one could tell"
6499,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,which was the least ugly.
6500,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6501,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"Now, one day, the man at the livery stable, where the Master kept his"
6502,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"horse, said that he wanted a cat, because the rats were giving him a"
6503,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,great deal of trouble in his hay-loft. So the Master took the ugliest
6504,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"cat of all, which was really ugly enough to frighten the crows, and he"
6505,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"put her in a basket, and took her away to the stable, and everybody was"
6506,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,glad.
6507,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6508,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"But three days after, as the Person was weeding the flowerbed, she"
6509,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"heard a loud squeal of joy, and felt something rubbing against her"
6510,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"back; she turned round, and there was the Ugliest Cat, purring and"
6511,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"squeaking, and seeming just as glad to get back as if she were"
6512,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"perfectly beautiful, and as if everybody loved her to distraction. She"
6513,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"was sent to the stable again, but this time she came back the very next"
6514,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"day, because she had found out the way. So she stayed."
6515,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6516,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"But after that, things went worse than ever. The Person went out to"
6517,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"walk, and a cat followed her home, and would not go away, and would"
6518,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"come in! and Maggie, the cook, said she “couldn’t see the crathur"
6519,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"starve,” so she fed it and it stayed. And on Thanksgiving Day a"
6520,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"miserable hungry kitten came to the door and begged to be let in, and"
6521,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"nobody could refuse to give it a Thanksgiving dinner, so _it_ came in,"
6522,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,and _it_ stayed.
6523,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,
6524,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,And now the Person who does not like eats has nothing but cats about
6525,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,her all the time. They lie on the stairs and trip her up in the dark.
6526,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"If she takes up a clothes-basket, out rolls a kitten. If she gets the"
6527,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"little sleigh to take the Littlest Mistress to ride, out jumps a cat."
6528,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"Wherever she goes, whatever she does, she sees a dirty white cat, or"
6529,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"a rusty black cat, or a faded yellow cat, or a dingy tabby cat, or a"
6530,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,"hideous tortoise-shell beast, which is the Ugliest Cat of all. And the"
6531,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,Person would like the children to tell her _what_ is to be done about
6532,THE PERSON WHO DID NOT LIKE CATS.,it!
