2907,THE VICAR,"St. Mary's Hill and Sandy Thicket,"
2908,THE VICAR,"Was always shown across the Green,"
2909,THE VICAR,And guided to the Parson's wicket.

2911,THE VICAR,Back flew the bolt of lissom lath;
2912,THE VICAR,"Fair Margaret, in her tidy kirtle,"
2913,THE VICAR,Led the lorn traveller up the path
2914,THE VICAR,Through clean-clipt rows of box and myrtle;

2916,THE VICAR,"Upon the parlor steps collected,"
2917,THE VICAR,"Wagged all their tails, and seemed to say,"

2937,THE VICAR,
2938,THE VICAR,His talk was like a stream which runs
2939,THE VICAR,With rapid change from rocks to roses;
2940,THE VICAR,It slipped from politics to puns;
2941,THE VICAR,It passed from Mahomet to Moses;
2942,THE VICAR,Beginning with the laws which keep
2943,THE VICAR,"The planets in their radiant courses,"

2946,THE VICAR,
2947,THE VICAR,"He was a shrewd and sound divine,"
2948,THE VICAR,Of loud Dissent the mortal terror;
2949,THE VICAR,"And when, by dint of page and line,"

2951,THE VICAR,"The Baptist found him far too deep,"
2952,THE VICAR,"The Deist sighed with saving sorrow,"
2953,THE VICAR,And the lean Levite went to sleep

2955,THE VICAR,
2956,THE VICAR,His sermon never said or showed
2957,THE VICAR,"That Earth is foul, that Heaven is gracious,"
2958,THE VICAR,Without refreshment on the road
2959,THE VICAR,"From Jerome, or from Athanasius;"
2960,THE VICAR,And sure a righteous zeal inspired
2961,THE VICAR,"The hand and head that penned and planned them,"
2962,THE VICAR,"For all who understood, admired,"

2964,THE VICAR,
2965,THE VICAR,"He wrote, too, in a quiet way,"
2966,THE VICAR,"Small treatises, and smaller verses,"

2969,THE VICAR,True histories of last year's ghost;
2970,THE VICAR,Lines to a ringlet or a turban;
2971,THE VICAR,"And trifles to the Morning Post,"
2972,THE VICAR,And nothings for Sylvanus Urban.
2973,THE VICAR,
2974,THE VICAR,"He did not think all mischief fair,"
2975,THE VICAR,Although he had a knack of joking;
2976,THE VICAR,"He did not make himself a bear,"
2977,THE VICAR,Although he had a taste for smoking;
2978,THE VICAR,"And when religious sects ran mad,"
2979,THE VICAR,"He held, in spite of all his learning,"
2980,THE VICAR,"That if a man's belief is bad,"
2981,THE VICAR,It will not be improved by burning.
2982,THE VICAR,
2983,THE VICAR,"And he was kind, and loved to sit"
2984,THE VICAR,"In the low hut or garnished cottage,"
2985,THE VICAR,"And praise the farmer's homely wit,"
2986,THE VICAR,And share the widow's homelier pottage.
2987,THE VICAR,"At his approach complaint grew mild,"
2988,THE VICAR,"And when his hand unbarred the shutter,"
2989,THE VICAR,The clammy lips of Fever smiled
2990,THE VICAR,The welcome which they could not utter.
2991,THE VICAR,
2992,THE VICAR,He always had a tale for me
2993,THE VICAR,Of Julius Caesar or of Venus;
2994,THE VICAR,"From him I learned the rule of three,"
2995,THE VICAR,"Cat's-cradle, leap-frog, and Quae genus."
2996,THE VICAR,"I used to singe his powdered wig,"
2997,THE VICAR,"To steal the staff he put such trust in,"
2998,THE VICAR,And make the puppy dance a jig
2999,THE VICAR,When he began to quote Augustine.
3000,THE VICAR,
3001,THE VICAR,"Alack, the change!  In vain I look"
3002,THE VICAR,For haunts in which my boyhood trifled;

3004,THE VICAR,"The trees I climbed, the beds I rifled."
3005,THE VICAR,"The church is larger than before,"
3006,THE VICAR,You reach it by a carriage entry:
3007,THE VICAR,"It holds three hundred people more,"
3008,THE VICAR,And pews are fitted up for gentry.
3009,THE VICAR,
3010,THE VICAR,Sit in the Vicar's seat; you'll hear
3011,THE VICAR,"The doctrine of a gentle Johnian,"
3012,THE VICAR,"Whose hand is white, whose voice is clear,"
3013,THE VICAR,Whose phrase is very Ciceronian.
3014,THE VICAR,"Where is the old man laid?  Look down,"

3043,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,
3044,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Dark was her hair, her hand was white;"

3048,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Her every look, her every smile,"
3049,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Shot right and left a score of arrows;
3050,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"I thought 'twas Venus from her isle,"
3051,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,And wondered where she'd left her sparrows.
3052,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,
3053,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"She talked of politics or prayers,--"
3054,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Of Southey's prose, or Wordsworth's sonnets,"
3055,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Of danglers or of dancing bears,"
3056,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Of battles, or the last new bonnets;"
3057,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"By candle-light, at twelve o'clock,"
3058,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"To me it mattered not a tittle,"
3059,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"If those bright lips had quoted Locke,"
3060,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,I might have thought they murmured Little.
3061,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,
3062,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Through sunny May, through sultry June,"
3063,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,I loved her with a love eternal;
3064,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"I spoke her praises to the moon,"
3065,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,I wrote them to the Sunday Journal.
3066,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,My mother laughed; I soon found out

3074,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Whose color was extremely hectic;
3075,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Her grandmother, for many a year,"
3076,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Had fed the parish with her bounty;

3089,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"She sketched; the vale, the wood, the beach,"
3090,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Grew lovelier from her pencil's shading;
3091,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,She botanized; I envied each

3093,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"She warbled Handel; it was grand,--"
3094,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,She made the Catilina jealous;

3097,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,

3113,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"She frowned, and every took was sad,"

3115,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,
3116,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"She smiled on many just for fun,--"

3118,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"I was the first, the only one"
3119,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Her heart had thought of for a minute.

3131,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"A miniature, a lock of hair,"

3133,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,
3134,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,We parted: months and years rolled by;
3135,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,We met again four summers after.
3136,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"Our parting was all sob and sigh,--"
3137,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,Our meeting was all mirth and laughter;
3138,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,"For, in my heart's most secret cell,"
3139,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM,There had been many other lodgers;

3244,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Of old romance are over;
3245,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And minstrels now care naught for bays,"
3246,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Nor damsels for a lover;
3247,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And hearts are cold, and lips are mute"
3248,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"That kindled once with passion,"
3249,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And now we've neither lance nor lute,"
3250,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And tilting's out of fashion.
3251,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3252,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Yet weeping Beauty mourns the time
3253,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,When Love found words in flowers;
3254,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"When softest test sighs were breathed in rhyme,"
3255,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And sweetest songs in bowers;
3256,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Now wedlock is a sober thing--
3257,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,No more of chains or forges!--
3258,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,A plain young man--a plain gold ring--
3259,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,The curate--and St. George's.
3260,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3261,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then every cross-bow had a string,"
3262,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And every heart a fetter;
3263,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And making love was quite the thing,"
3264,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And making verses better;
3265,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And maiden-aunts were never seen,"
3266,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And gallant beaux were plenty;
3267,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And lasses married at sixteen,"
3268,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And died at one-and-twenty.
3269,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3270,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then hawking was a noble sport,"
3271,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And chess a pretty science;
3272,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And huntsmen learned to blow a morte,"
3273,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And heralds a defiance;
3274,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And knights and spearmen showed their might,"
3275,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And timid hinds took warning;
3276,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And hypocras was warmed at night,"
3277,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And coursers in the morning.
3278,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3279,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then plumes and pennons were prepared,"
3280,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And patron-saints were lauded;
3281,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And noble deeds were bravely dared,"
3282,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And noble dames applauded;
3283,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And Beauty played the leech's part,"
3284,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And wounds were healed with syrup;
3285,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And warriors sometimes lost a heart,"
3286,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,But never lost a stirrup.
3287,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3288,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then there was no such thing as Fear,"
3289,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And no such word as Reason;
3290,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And Faith was like a pointed spear,"
3291,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And Fickleness was treason;
3292,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And hearts were soft, though blows were hard;"
3293,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"But when the fight was over,"
3294,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"A brimming goblet cheered the board,"
3295,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,His Lady's smile the lover.
3296,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3297,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Ay, those were golden days!  The moon"
3298,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Had then her true adorers;
3299,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And there were lyres and lutes in tune,"
3300,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And no such thing as snorers;
3301,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And lovers swam, and held at naught"
3302,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Streams broader than the Mersey;
3303,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And fifty thousand would have fought
3304,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,For a smile from Lady Jersey.
3305,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3306,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then people wore an iron vest,"
3307,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And bad no use for tailors;
3308,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And the artizans who lived the best
3309,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,Were armorers and nailers;
3310,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And steel was measured by the ell
3311,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And trousers lined with leather;
3312,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"And jesters wore a cap and bell,"
3313,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And knights a cap and feather.
3314,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,
3315,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Then single folks might live at ease,"
3316,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,And married ones might sever;
3317,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Uncommon doctors had their fees,"
3318,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,But Doctor's Commons never;
3319,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"O! had we in those times been bred,"
3320,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Fair cousin, for thy glances,"
3321,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,"Instead of breaking Priscian's head,"
3322,CHIVALRY AT A DISCOUNT,I had been breaking lances!

3489,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Near her eye.
3490,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,
3491,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,"Her rounded form was lean,"

3496,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Would she not?
3497,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,
3498,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Ah perishable clay!
3499,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Her charms had dropped away
3500,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,One by one:
3501,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,But if she heaved a sigh
3502,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,"With a burden, it was, ""Thy"

3504,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,
3505,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,"In travail, as in tears,"

3508,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,In mercy she was borne
3509,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Where the weary and the worn
3510,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,Are at rest.
3511,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,
3512,TO MY GRANDMOTHER,"Oh, if you now are there,"

3808,COMPANIONS,"Or made pretty pretence to talk,"
3809,COMPANIONS,"As, her hand within mine, we wandered."
3810,COMPANIONS,"Toward the pool by the lime-tree walk,"
3811,COMPANIONS,While the dew fell in showers from the passion flowers
3812,COMPANIONS,And the blush-rose bent on her stalk.
3813,COMPANIONS,
3814,COMPANIONS,I cannot recall her figure:
3815,COMPANIONS,Was it regal as Juno's own?
3816,COMPANIONS,Or only a trifle bigger
3817,COMPANIONS,Than the elves who surround the throne
3818,COMPANIONS,"Of the Fairy Queen, and are seen, I ween,"
3819,COMPANIONS,By mortals in dreams alone?
3820,COMPANIONS,
3821,COMPANIONS,What her eyes were like I know not:
3822,COMPANIONS,Perhaps they were blurred with tears;
3823,COMPANIONS,And perhaps in yon skies there glow not
3824,COMPANIONS,(On the contrary) clearer spheres.
3825,COMPANIONS,No! as to her eyes I am just as wise
3826,COMPANIONS,"As you or the cat, my dears."
3827,COMPANIONS,
3828,COMPANIONS,"Her teeth, I presume, were ""pearly"":"
3829,COMPANIONS,"But which was she, brunette or blonde?"
3830,COMPANIONS,"Her hair, was it quaintly curly,"
3831,COMPANIONS,Or as straight as a beadle's wand?
3832,COMPANIONS,That I failed to remark: it was rather dark
3833,COMPANIONS,And shadowy round the pond.
3834,COMPANIONS,
3835,COMPANIONS,Then the hand that reposed so snugly
3836,COMPANIONS,"In mine,--was it plump or spare?"
3837,COMPANIONS,Was the countenance fair or ugly?
3838,COMPANIONS,"Nay, children, you have me there!"
3839,COMPANIONS,My eyes were p'haps blurred; and besides I'd heard
3840,COMPANIONS,That it's horribly rude to stare.
3841,COMPANIONS,
3842,COMPANIONS,"And I,--was I brusque and surly?"
3843,COMPANIONS,Or oppressively bland and fond?
3844,COMPANIONS,Was I partial to rising early?
3845,COMPANIONS,"Or why did we twain abscond,"
3846,COMPANIONS,"When nobody knew, from the public view"
3847,COMPANIONS,To prowl by a misty pond?
3848,COMPANIONS,
3849,COMPANIONS,"What passed, what was felt or spoken,--"
3850,COMPANIONS,"Whether anything passed at all,--"
3851,COMPANIONS,And whether the heart was broken
3852,COMPANIONS,"That beat under that sheltering shawl,--"
3853,COMPANIONS,"(If shawl she had on, which I doubt),--has gone,"
3854,COMPANIONS,"Yes, gone from me past recall."
3855,COMPANIONS,
3856,COMPANIONS,Was I haply the lady's suitor?
3857,COMPANIONS,Or her uncle?  I can't make out;
3858,COMPANIONS,"Ask your governess, dears, or tutor."
3859,COMPANIONS,"For myself, I'm in hopeless doubt"
3860,COMPANIONS,"As to why we were there, who on earth we were,"
3861,COMPANIONS,And what this is all about.

3870,DOROTHY Q,
3871,DOROTHY Q,"Grandmother's mother: her age, I guess,"
3872,DOROTHY Q,"Thirteen summers, or something less:"
3873,DOROTHY Q,"Girlish bust, but womanly air;"
3874,DOROTHY Q,"Smooth, square forehead with uprolled hair;"
3875,DOROTHY Q,Lips that lover has never kissed;
3876,DOROTHY Q,Taper fingers and slender wrist;
3877,DOROTHY Q,Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade;
3878,DOROTHY Q,So they painted the little maid.
3879,DOROTHY Q,
3880,DOROTHY Q,On her hand a parrot green
3881,DOROTHY Q,Sits unmoving and broods serene.
3882,DOROTHY Q,"Hold up the canvas full in view,--"
3883,DOROTHY Q,"Look! there's a rent the light shines through,"
3884,DOROTHY Q,"Dark with a century's fringe of dust,--"
3885,DOROTHY Q,That was a Red-Coat's rapier-thrust!
3886,DOROTHY Q,"Such is the tale the lady old,"
3887,DOROTHY Q,"Dorothy's daughter's daughter, told."
3888,DOROTHY Q,
3889,DOROTHY Q,"Who the painter was none may tell,--"
3890,DOROTHY Q,One whose best was not over well;
3891,DOROTHY Q,"Hard and dry, it must be confessed,"
3892,DOROTHY Q,Flat as a rose that has long been pressed;
3893,DOROTHY Q,"Yet in her cheek the hues are bright,"
3894,DOROTHY Q,"Dainty colors of red and white,"
3895,DOROTHY Q,And in her slender shape are seen
3896,DOROTHY Q,Hint and promise of stately mien.
3897,DOROTHY Q,
3898,DOROTHY Q,"Look not on her with eyes of scorn,--"
3899,DOROTHY Q,Dorothy Q. was a lady born!
3900,DOROTHY Q,"Ay! since the galloping Normans came,"
3901,DOROTHY Q,England's annals have known her name;
3902,DOROTHY Q,And still to the three-hilled rebel town
3903,DOROTHY Q,"Dear is that ancient name's renown,"
3904,DOROTHY Q,"For many a civic wreath they won,"
3905,DOROTHY Q,The youthful sire and the gray-haired son.
3906,DOROTHY Q,
3907,DOROTHY Q,O Damsel Dorothy! Dorothy Q.!
3908,DOROTHY Q,Strange is the gift that I owe to you;
3909,DOROTHY Q,Such a gift as never a king
3910,DOROTHY Q,"Save to daughter or son might bring,--"
3911,DOROTHY Q,"All my tenure of heart and hand,"
3912,DOROTHY Q,All my title to house and land;
3913,DOROTHY Q,Mother and sister and child and wife
3914,DOROTHY Q,And joy and sorrow and death and life!
3915,DOROTHY Q,
3916,DOROTHY Q,What if a hundred years ago
3917,DOROTHY Q,"Those close-shut lips had answered No,"
3918,DOROTHY Q,When forth the tremulous question came
3919,DOROTHY Q,"That cost the maiden her Norman name,"
3920,DOROTHY Q,And under the folds that look so still
3921,DOROTHY Q,The bodice swelled with the bosom's thrill?
3922,DOROTHY Q,"Should I be I, or would it be"
3923,DOROTHY Q,"One tenth another, to nine tenths me?"
3924,DOROTHY Q,
3925,DOROTHY Q,Soft is the breath of a maiden's YES:
3926,DOROTHY Q,Not the light gossamer stirs with less;
3927,DOROTHY Q,But never a cable that holds so fast
3928,DOROTHY Q,"Through all the battles of wave and blast,"
3929,DOROTHY Q,And never an echo of speech or song
3930,DOROTHY Q,That lives in the babbling air so long!
3931,DOROTHY Q,There were tones in the voice that whispered then
3932,DOROTHY Q,You may hear to-day in a hundred men.
3933,DOROTHY Q,
3934,DOROTHY Q,"O lady and lover, how faint and far"
3935,DOROTHY Q,"Your images hover,--and here we are"
3936,DOROTHY Q,"Solid and stirring in flesh and bone,--"
3937,DOROTHY Q,"Edward's and Dorothy's--all their own,--"
3938,DOROTHY Q,A goodly record for Time to show
3939,DOROTHY Q,Of a syllable spoken so long ago!--
3940,DOROTHY Q,"Shall I bless you, Dorothy, or forgive"
3941,DOROTHY Q,For the tender whisper that bade me live?
3942,DOROTHY Q,
3943,DOROTHY Q,"It shall be a blessing, my little maid!"
3944,DOROTHY Q,"I will heal the stab of the Red-Coat's blade,"
3945,DOROTHY Q,"And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame,"
3946,DOROTHY Q,And gild with a rhyme your household name;
3947,DOROTHY Q,So you shall smile on us brave and bright
3948,DOROTHY Q,"As first you greeted the morning's light,"
3949,DOROTHY Q,And live untroubled by woes and fears
3950,DOROTHY Q,Through a second youth of a hundred years.

3959,MY AUNT,My aunt! my dear unmarried aunt!
3960,MY AUNT,Long years have o'er her flown;
3961,MY AUNT,Yet still she strains the aching clasp
3962,MY AUNT,That binds her virgin zone;
3963,MY AUNT,"I know it hurts her,--though she looks"
3964,MY AUNT,As cheerful as she can;
3965,MY AUNT,"Her waist is ampler than her life,"

3967,MY AUNT,
3968,MY AUNT,My aunt! my poor deluded aunt!
3969,MY AUNT,Her hair is almost gray;
3970,MY AUNT,Why will she train that winter curl
3971,MY AUNT,In such a spring-like way?
3972,MY AUNT,"How can she lay her glasses down,"
3973,MY AUNT,"And say she reads as well,"
3974,MY AUNT,"When, through a double convex lens,"
3975,MY AUNT,She just makes out to spell?
3976,MY AUNT,
3977,MY AUNT,"Her father,--grandpapa! forgive"
3978,MY AUNT,"This erring lip its smiles,--"
3979,MY AUNT,Vowed she should make the finest girl
3980,MY AUNT,Within a hundred miles;
3981,MY AUNT,He sent her to a stylish school;
3982,MY AUNT,'Twas in her thirteenth June;
3983,MY AUNT,"And with her, as the rules required,"
3984,MY AUNT,"""Two towels and a spoon."""
3985,MY AUNT,
3986,MY AUNT,"They braced my aunt against a board,"
3987,MY AUNT,To make her straight and tall;
3988,MY AUNT,"They laced her up, they starved her down,"
3989,MY AUNT,To make her light and small;
3990,MY AUNT,"They pinched her feet, they singed her hair,"
3991,MY AUNT,They screwed it up with pins;--
3992,MY AUNT,"Oh, never mortal suffered more"
3993,MY AUNT,In penance for her sins.
3994,MY AUNT,
3995,MY AUNT,"So, when my precious aunt was done,"
3996,MY AUNT,My grandsire brought her back;
3997,MY AUNT,"(By daylight, lest some rabid youth"
3998,MY AUNT,Might follow on the track;)
3999,MY AUNT,"""Ah!"" said my grandsire, as he shook"
4000,MY AUNT,"Some powder in his pan,"
4001,MY AUNT,"""What could this lovely creature do"
4002,MY AUNT,"Against a desperate man!"""
4003,MY AUNT,
4004,MY AUNT,"Alas! nor chariot, nor barouche,"
4005,MY AUNT,"Nor bandit cavalcade,"
4006,MY AUNT,Tore from the trembling father's arms
4007,MY AUNT,His all-accomplished maid.
4008,MY AUNT,For her how happy had it been!
4009,MY AUNT,And Heaven had spared to me
4010,MY AUNT,"To see one sad, ungathered rose"
4011,MY AUNT,On my ancestral tree.

4062,THE LAST LEAF,I know it is a sin
4063,THE LAST LEAF,For me to sit and grin

4085,CONTENTMENT,"I only wish a hut of stone,"
4086,CONTENTMENT,"(A very plain brown stone will do,)"
4087,CONTENTMENT,That I may call my own;--
4088,CONTENTMENT,"And close at hand is such a one,"

4095,CONTENTMENT,I always thought cold victual nice;--

6753,EVOLUTION,
6754,EVOLUTION,"Mindless we lived, mindless we loved,"
6755,EVOLUTION,And mindless at last we died;
6756,EVOLUTION,And deep in the rift of a Caradoc drift
6757,EVOLUTION,We slumbered side by side.
6758,EVOLUTION,"The world turned on in the lathe of time,"
6759,EVOLUTION,"The hot sands heaved amain,"
6760,EVOLUTION,"Till we caught our breath from the womb of death,"
6761,EVOLUTION,And crept into life again.
6762,EVOLUTION,
6763,EVOLUTION,"We were Amphibians, scaled and tailed,"
6764,EVOLUTION,And drab as a dead man's hand.
6765,EVOLUTION,We coiled at ease 'neath the dripping trees
6766,EVOLUTION,"Or trailed through the mud and sand,"
6767,EVOLUTION,"Croaking and blind, with our three-clawed feet,"
6768,EVOLUTION,"Writing a language dumb,"
6769,EVOLUTION,With never a spark in the empty dark
6770,EVOLUTION,To hint at a life to come.
6771,EVOLUTION,
6772,EVOLUTION,"Yet happy we lived, and happy we loved,"
6773,EVOLUTION,And happy we died once more.
6774,EVOLUTION,Our forms were rolled in the clinging mold
6775,EVOLUTION,Of a Neocomian shore.
6776,EVOLUTION,"The aeons came and the aeons fled,"
6777,EVOLUTION,And the sleep that wrapped us fast
6778,EVOLUTION,"Was riven away in a newer day,"
6779,EVOLUTION,And the night of death was past.
6780,EVOLUTION,
6781,EVOLUTION,Then light and swift through the jungle trees
6782,EVOLUTION,"We swung in our airy flights,"
6783,EVOLUTION,Or breathed the balms of the fronded palms
6784,EVOLUTION,In the hush of the moonless nights.
6785,EVOLUTION,"And oh, what beautiful years were these"
6786,EVOLUTION,When our hearts clung each to each;
6787,EVOLUTION,When life was filled and our senses thrilled
6788,EVOLUTION,In the first faint dawn of speech!
6789,EVOLUTION,
6790,EVOLUTION,"Thus life by life, and love by love,"
6791,EVOLUTION,"We passed through the cycles strange,"
6792,EVOLUTION,"And breath by breath, and death by death,"
6793,EVOLUTION,We followed the chain of change.
6794,EVOLUTION,Till there came a time in the law of life
6795,EVOLUTION,When over the nursing sod
6796,EVOLUTION,"The shadows broke, and the soul awoke"
6797,EVOLUTION,"In a strange, dim dream of God."
6798,EVOLUTION,
6799,EVOLUTION,I was thewed like an Aurocks bull
6800,EVOLUTION,"And tusked like the great Cave-Bear,"
6801,EVOLUTION,"And you, my sweet, from head to feet,"
6802,EVOLUTION,Were gowned in your glorious hair.
6803,EVOLUTION,"Deep in the gloom of a fireless cave,"
6804,EVOLUTION,"When the night fell o'er the plain,"
6805,EVOLUTION,"And the moon hung red o'er the river bed,"
6806,EVOLUTION,We mumbled the bones of the slain.
6807,EVOLUTION,
6808,EVOLUTION,"I flaked a flint to a cutting edge,"
6809,EVOLUTION,And shaped it with brutish craft;
6810,EVOLUTION,"I broke a shank from the woodland dank,"
6811,EVOLUTION,"And fitted it, head to haft."
6812,EVOLUTION,"Then I hid me close in the reedy tarn,"
6813,EVOLUTION,Where the Mammoth came to drink--
6814,EVOLUTION,"Through brawn and bone I drave the stone,"
6815,EVOLUTION,And slew him upon the brink.
6816,EVOLUTION,
6817,EVOLUTION,"Loud I howled through the moonlit wastes,"
6818,EVOLUTION,Loud answered our kith and kin;
6819,EVOLUTION,From west and east to the crimson feast
6820,EVOLUTION,The clan came trooping in.
6821,EVOLUTION,"O'er joint and gristle and padded hoof,"
6822,EVOLUTION,"We fought and clawed and tore,"
6823,EVOLUTION,"And cheek by jowl, with many a growl,"
6824,EVOLUTION,We talked the marvel o'er.
6825,EVOLUTION,
6826,EVOLUTION,I carved that fight on a reindeer bone
6827,EVOLUTION,With rude and hairy hand;
6828,EVOLUTION,I pictured his fall on the cavern wall
6829,EVOLUTION,That men might understand.
6830,EVOLUTION,"For we lived by blood and the right of might,"
6831,EVOLUTION,"Ere human laws were drawn,"
6832,EVOLUTION,And the Age of Sin did not begin
6833,EVOLUTION,Till our brutal tusks were gone.
6834,EVOLUTION,
6835,EVOLUTION,"And that was a million years ago,"
6836,EVOLUTION,In a time that no man knows;
6837,EVOLUTION,"Yet here to-night in the mellow light,"
6838,EVOLUTION,We sit at Delmonico's.
6839,EVOLUTION,"Your eyes are deep as the Devon springs,"
6840,EVOLUTION,"Your hair is as dark as jet,"
6841,EVOLUTION,"Your years are few, your life is new,"
6842,EVOLUTION,"Your soul untried, and yet--"

6844,EVOLUTION,"Our trail is on the Kimmeridge clay,"
6845,EVOLUTION,And the scarp of the Purbeck flags;
6846,EVOLUTION,"We have left our bones in the Bagshot stones,"
6847,EVOLUTION,And deep in the Coralline crags.
6848,EVOLUTION,"Our love is old, and our lives are old,"
6849,EVOLUTION,And death shall come amain.
6850,EVOLUTION,"Should it come to-day, what man may say"
6851,EVOLUTION,We shall not live again?
6852,EVOLUTION,
6853,EVOLUTION,God wrought our souls from the Tremadoc beds
6854,EVOLUTION,And furnished them wings to fly;

6856,EVOLUTION,And I know that it shall not die;
6857,EVOLUTION,Though cities have sprung above the graves
6858,EVOLUTION,"Where the crook-boned men made war,"
6859,EVOLUTION,And the ox-wain creaks o'er the buried caves
6860,EVOLUTION,Where the mummied mammoths are.
6861,EVOLUTION,
6862,EVOLUTION,"Then, as we linger at luncheon here,"

6969,THE TALENTED MAN,Letter From A Lady In London To A Lady At Lausanne
6970,THE TALENTED MAN,
6971,THE TALENTED MAN,"Dear Alice! you'll laugh when you know it,--"
6972,THE TALENTED MAN,"Last week, at the Duchess's ball,"
6973,THE TALENTED MAN,"I danced with the clever new poet,--"
6974,THE TALENTED MAN,"You've heard of him,--Tully St. Paul."
6975,THE TALENTED MAN,Miss Jonquil was perfectly frantic;
6976,THE TALENTED MAN,I wish you had seen Lady Anne!
6977,THE TALENTED MAN,"It really was very romantic,"
6978,THE TALENTED MAN,He is such a talented man!
6979,THE TALENTED MAN,
6980,THE TALENTED MAN,"He came up from Brazen Nose College,"
6981,THE TALENTED MAN,"Just caught, as they call it, this spring;"
6982,THE TALENTED MAN,"And his head, love, is stuffed full of knowledge"
6983,THE TALENTED MAN,Of every conceivable thing.
6984,THE TALENTED MAN,"Of science and logic he chatters,"
6985,THE TALENTED MAN,As fine and as fast as he can;
6986,THE TALENTED MAN,"Though I am no judge of such matters,"
6987,THE TALENTED MAN,I'm sure he's a talented man.
6988,THE TALENTED MAN,
6989,THE TALENTED MAN,His stories and jests are delightful;--
6990,THE TALENTED MAN,"Not stories or jests, dear, for you;"
6991,THE TALENTED MAN,"The jests are exceedingly spiteful,"
6992,THE TALENTED MAN,The stories not always quite true.
6993,THE TALENTED MAN,Perhaps to be kind and veracious
6994,THE TALENTED MAN,May do pretty well at Lausanne;
6995,THE TALENTED MAN,"But it never would answer,--good gracious!"
6996,THE TALENTED MAN,Chez nous--in a talented man.
6997,THE TALENTED MAN,
6998,THE TALENTED MAN,"He sneers,--how my Alice would scold him!--"
6999,THE TALENTED MAN,At the bliss of a sigh or a tear;
7000,THE TALENTED MAN,He laughed--only think!--when I told him
7001,THE TALENTED MAN,How we cried o'er Trevelyan last year;
7002,THE TALENTED MAN,I vow I was quite in a passion;
7003,THE TALENTED MAN,I broke all the sticks of my fan;
7004,THE TALENTED MAN,"But sentiment's quite out of fashion,"
7005,THE TALENTED MAN,"It seems, in a talented man."
7006,THE TALENTED MAN,
7007,THE TALENTED MAN,"Lady Bab, who is terribly moral,"
7008,THE TALENTED MAN,"Has told me that Tully is vain,"
7009,THE TALENTED MAN,"And apt--which is silly--to quarrel,"
7010,THE TALENTED MAN,And fond--which is sad--of champagne.
7011,THE TALENTED MAN,"I listened, and doubted, dear Alice,"
7012,THE TALENTED MAN,"For I saw, when my Lady began,"
7013,THE TALENTED MAN,It was only the Dowager's malice;--
7014,THE TALENTED MAN,She does hate a talented man!
7015,THE TALENTED MAN,
7016,THE TALENTED MAN,"He's hideous, I own it.  But fame, love,"
7017,THE TALENTED MAN,Is all that these eyes can adore;
7018,THE TALENTED MAN,"He's lame,--but Lord Byron was lame, love,"
7019,THE TALENTED MAN,"And dumpy,--but so is Tom Moore."
7020,THE TALENTED MAN,"Then his voice,--such a voice! my sweet creature,"
7021,THE TALENTED MAN,It's like your Aunt Lucy's toucan:
7022,THE TALENTED MAN,"But oh! what's a tone or a feature,"
7023,THE TALENTED MAN,When once one's a talented man?
7024,THE TALENTED MAN,
7025,THE TALENTED MAN,"My mother, you know, all the season,"
7026,THE TALENTED MAN,Has talked of Sir Geoffrey's estate;
7027,THE TALENTED MAN,"And truly, to do the fool reason,"
7028,THE TALENTED MAN,He has been less horrid of late.
7029,THE TALENTED MAN,"But to-day, when we drive in the carriage,"
7030,THE TALENTED MAN,I'll tell her to lay down her plan;--
7031,THE TALENTED MAN,"If ever I venture on marriage,"
7032,THE TALENTED MAN,It must be a talented man!
7033,THE TALENTED MAN,
7034,THE TALENTED MAN,"P.S.--I have found, on reflection,"
7035,THE TALENTED MAN,"One fault in my friend,--entre nous;"
7036,THE TALENTED MAN,"Without it, he'd just be perfection;--"
7037,THE TALENTED MAN,"Poor fellow, he has not a sou!"
7038,THE TALENTED MAN,"And so, when he comes in September"
7039,THE TALENTED MAN,"To shoot with my uncle, Sir Dan,"
7040,THE TALENTED MAN,I've promised mamma to remember
7041,THE TALENTED MAN,He's only a talented man!

7353,I,I drew it from its china tomb;--
7354,I,It came out feebly scented
7355,I,With some thin ghost of past perfume
7356,I,That dust and days had lent it.
7357,I,
7358,I,"An old, old letter,--folded still!"
7359,I,"To read with due composure,"
7360,I,"I sought the sun-lit window-sill,"
7361,I,"Above the gray enclosure,"
7362,I,
7363,I,"That, glimmering in the sultry haze,"
7364,I,"Faint-flowered, dimly shaded,"
7365,I,"Slumbered like Goldsmith's Madam Blaize,"
7366,I,Bedizened and brocaded.
7367,I,
7368,I,A queer old place!  You'd surely say
7369,I,Some tea-board garden-maker
7370,I,Had planned it in Dutch William's day
7371,I,"To please some florist Quaker,"
7372,I,
7373,I,"So trim it was.  The yew-trees still,"
7374,I,"With pious care perverted,"
7375,I,Grew in the same grim shapes; and still
7376,I,The lipless dolphin spurted;
7377,I,
7378,I,Still in his wonted state abode
7379,I,The broken-nosed Apollo;
7380,I,And still the cypress-arbor showed
7381,I,The same umbrageous hollow.
7382,I,
7383,I,"Only,--as fresh young Beauty gleams"
7384,I,"From coffee-colored laces,"
7385,I,So peeped from its old-fashioned dreams
7386,I,The fresher modern traces;
7387,I,
7388,I,"For idle mallet, hoop, and ball"
7389,I,Upon the lawn were lying;
7390,I,"A magazine, a tumbled shawl,"
7391,I,Round which the swifts were flying;
7392,I,
7393,I,"And, tossed beside the Guelder rose,"
7394,I,"A heap of rainbow knitting,"
7395,I,"Where, blinking in her pleased repose,"
7396,I,A Persian cat was sitting.
7397,I,
7398,I,"""A place to love in,--live,--for aye,"
7399,I,"If we too, like Tithonus,"
7400,I,Could find some God to stretch the gray
7401,I,Scant life the Fates have thrown us;
7402,I,
7403,I,"""But now by steam we run our race,"
7404,I,"With buttoned heart and pocket,"
7405,I,"Our Love's a gilded, surplus grace,--"
7406,I,Just like an empty locket!
7407,I,
7408,I,"""'The time is out of joint.'  Who will,"
7409,I,May strive to make it better;
7410,I,"For me, this warm old window-sill,"
7411,I,"And this old dusty letter."""
7412,I,
7413,II,II
7414,II,"""Dear John (the letter ran), it can't, can't be,"
7415,II,"For Father's gone to Chorley Fair with Sam,"
7416,II,"And Mother's storing Apples,--Prue and Me"
7417,II,Up to our Elbows making Damson Jam:
7418,II,"But we shall meet before a Week is gone,--"
7419,II,"''Tis a long Lane that has no Turning,' John!"
7420,II,
7421,II,"""Only till Sunday next, and then you'll wait"
7422,II,"Behind the White-Thorn, by the broken Stile--"
7423,II,"We can go round and catch them at the Gate,"
7424,II,"All to Ourselves, for nearly one long Mile;"
7425,II,"Dear Prue won't look, and Father he'll go on,"
7426,II,"And Sam's two Eyes are all for Cissy, John!"
7427,II,
7428,II,"""John, she's so smart,--with every Ribbon new,"
7429,II,"Flame-colored Sack, and Crimson Padesoy:"
7430,II,"As proud as proud; and has the Vapors too,"
7431,II,"Just like My Lady;--calls poor Sam a Boy,"
7432,II,And vows no Sweet-heart's worth the Thinking-on
7433,II,"Till he's past Thirty... I know better, John!"
7434,II,
7435,II,"""My Dear, I don't think that I thought of much"
7436,II,"Before we knew each other, I and you;"
7437,II,"And now, why, John, your least, least Finger-touch,"
7438,II,Gives me enough to think a Summer through.
7439,II,"See, for I send you Something!  There, 'tis gone!"
7440,II,"Look in this corner,--mind you find it, John!"
7441,II,
7442,III,III
7443,III,"This was the matter of the note,--"
7444,III,"A long-forgot deposit,"
7445,III,Dropped in an Indian dragon's throat
7446,III,"Deep in a fragrant closet,"
7447,III,
7448,III,"Piled with a dapper Dresden world,--"
7449,III,"Beaux, beauties, prayers, and poses,--"
7450,III,"Bonzes with squat legs undercurled,"
7451,III,And great jars filled with roses.
7452,III,
7453,III,"Ah, heart that wrote! Ah, lips that kissed!"
7454,III,You had no thought or presage
7455,III,Into what keeping you dismissed
7456,III,Your simple old-world message!
7457,III,
7458,III,A reverent one.  Though we to-day
7459,III,"Distrust beliefs and powers,"
7460,III,"The artless, ageless things you say"
7461,III,Are fresh as May's own flowers....
7462,III,
7463,III,I need not search too much to find
7464,III,"Whose lot it was to send it,"
7465,III,"That feel upon me yet the kind,"
7466,III,Soft hand of her who penned it;
7467,III,
7468,III,"And see, through two-score years of smoke,"
7469,III,"In by-gone, quaint apparel,"
7470,III,Shine from yon time-black Norway oak
7471,III,"The face of Patience Caryl,--"
7472,III,
7473,III,"The pale, smooth forehead, silver-tressed;"
7474,III,"The gray gown, primly flowered;"
7475,III,"The spotless, stately coif whose crest"
7476,III,Like Hector's horse-plume towered;
7477,III,
7478,III,And still the sweet half-solemn look
7479,III,"Where some past thought was clinging,"
7480,III,As when one shuts a serious book
7481,III,To hear the thrushes singing.
7482,III,
7483,III,"I kneel to you!  Of those you were,"
7484,III,"Whose kind old hearts grow mellow,--"
7485,III,"Whose fair old faces grow more fair,"
7486,III,As Point and Flanders yellow;
7487,III,
7488,III,"Whom some old store of garnered grief,"
7489,III,"Their placid temples shading,"
7490,III,Crowns like a wreath of autumn leaf
7491,III,With tender tints of fading.
7492,III,
7493,III,Peace to your soul!  You died unwed--
7494,III,Despite this loving letter.
7495,III,And what of John?  The less that's said
7496,III,"Of John, I think, the better."

7506,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Have shot my fawn, and it will die."
7507,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Ungentle men!  They cannot thrive
7508,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Who killed thee.  Thou ne'er didst, alive,"
7509,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Them any harm; alas! nor could
7510,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Thy death to them do any good.
7511,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"I'm sure I never wished them ill,"
7512,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Nor do I for all this; nor will:
7513,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"But, if my simple prayers may yet"
7514,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Prevail with Heaven to forget
7515,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Thy murder, I will join my tears"
7516,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Rather than fail.  But O my fears!
7517,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It cannot die so.  Heaven's King
7518,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Keeps register of everything,"
7519,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And nothing may we use in vain;
7520,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Even beasts must be with justice slain;
7521,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Else men are made their deodands.
7522,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Though they should wash their guilty hands
7523,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"In this warm life-blood, which doth part"
7524,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"From thine, and wound me to the heart,"
7525,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Yet could they not be clean; their stain
7526,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Is dyed in such a purple grain,"
7527,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,There is not such another in
7528,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The world to offer for their sin.
7529,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7530,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Inconstant Sylvio, when yet"
7531,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"I had not found him counterfeit,"
7532,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"One morning, I remember well,"
7533,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Tied in this silver chain and bell,"
7534,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Gave it to me: nay, and I know"
7535,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,What he said then--I'm sure I do.
7536,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Said he, ""Look how your huntsman here"
7537,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Hath taught a fawn to hunt his deer!"""
7538,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,But Sylvio soon had me beguiled:
7539,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"This waxed tame, while he grew wild,"
7540,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And, quite regardless of my smart,"
7541,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Left me his fawn, but took his heart."
7542,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7543,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Thenceforth I set myself to play
7544,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,My solitary time away
7545,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With this; and very well content
7546,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Could so mine idle life have spent;
7547,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"For it was full of sport, and light"
7548,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Of foot and heart, and did invite"
7549,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Me to its game: it seemed to bless
7550,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Itself in me.  How could I less
7551,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Than love it?  Oh, I cannot be"
7552,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Unkind to a beast that loveth me!
7553,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7554,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Had it lived long, I do not know"
7555,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Whether it, too, might have done so"
7556,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,As Sylvio did; his gifts might be
7557,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Perhaps as false, or more, than he."
7558,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"But I am sure, for aught that I"
7559,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Could in so short a time espy,"
7560,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Thy love was far more better than
7561,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The love of false and cruel man.
7562,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7563,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With sweetest milk and sugar first
7564,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,I it at mine own fingers nursed;
7565,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And as it grew, so every day,"
7566,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It waxed more white and sweet than they.
7567,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It had so sweet a breath! and oft
7568,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"I blushed to see its foot more soft,"
7569,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And white, shall I say? than my hand--"
7570,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Nay, any lady's of the land!"
7571,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7572,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It was a wondrous thing how fleet
7573,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,'Twas on those little silver feet.
7574,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With what a pretty skipping grace
7575,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It oft would challenge me the race;
7576,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And when't had left me far away,"
7577,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;"
7578,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"For it was nimbler much than hinds,"
7579,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And trod as if on the four winds.
7580,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7581,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"I have a garden of my own,"
7582,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"But so with roses overgrown,"
7583,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And lilies, that you would it guess"
7584,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,To be a little wilderness;
7585,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And all the spring-time of the year
7586,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It loved only to be there.
7587,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Among the beds of lilies I
7588,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Have sought it oft, where it should lie,"
7589,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Yet could not, till itself would rise,"
7590,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Find it, although before mine eyes;"
7591,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"For in the flaxen lilies' shade,"
7592,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It like a bank of lilies laid.
7593,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Upon the roses it would feed,"
7594,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Until its lips e'en seemed to bleed;
7595,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And then to me 'twould boldly trip,"
7596,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And print those roses on my lip.
7597,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,But all its chief delight was still
7598,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,On roses thus itself to fill;
7599,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And its pure virgin lips to fold
7600,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,In whitest sheets of lilies cold.
7601,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Had it lived long, it would have been"
7602,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Lilies without, roses within."
7603,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7604,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,O help!  O help! I see it faint
7605,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And die as calmly as a saint!
7606,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,See how it weeps! the tears do come
7607,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Sad, slowly, dropping like a gum."
7608,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,So weeps the wounded balsam; so
7609,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The holy frankincense doth flow;
7610,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The brotherless Heliades
7611,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Melt in such amber tears as these.
7612,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7613,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,I in a golden vial will
7614,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Keep these two crystal tears, and fill"
7615,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"It, till it doth overflow, with mine,"
7616,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Then place it in Diana's shrine.
7617,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7618,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Now my sweet fawn is vanished to
7619,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Whither the swans and turtles go;
7620,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,In fair Elysium to endure
7621,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.
7622,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"O, do not run too fast, for I"
7623,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Will but bespeak thy grave, and die."
7624,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
7625,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,First my unhappy statue shall
7626,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Be cut in marble; and withal
7627,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Let it be weeping too; but there
7628,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The engraver sure his art may spare;
7629,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,For I so truly thee bemoan
7630,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"That I shall weep though I be stone,"
7631,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Until my tears, still dropping, wear"
7632,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"My breast, themselves engraving there;"
7633,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Then at my feet shalt thou be laid,"
7634,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Of purest alabaster made;
7635,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,For I would have thine image be
7636,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING FOR THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"White as I can, though not as thee."

8012,GEIST'S GRAVE,"On us, who stood despondent by,"
8013,GEIST'S GRAVE,"A meek last glance of love didst throw,"
8014,GEIST'S GRAVE,And humbly lay thee down to die.
8015,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8016,GEIST'S GRAVE,Yet would we keep thee in our heart--

8019,GEIST'S GRAVE,And be as if thou ne'er hadst been.

8021,GEIST'S GRAVE,And so there rise these lines of verse
8022,GEIST'S GRAVE,On lips that rarely form them now;
8023,GEIST'S GRAVE,While to each other we rehearse:
8024,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Such ways, such arts, such looks hadst thou!"
8025,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8026,GEIST'S GRAVE,"We stroke thy broad brown paws again,"
8027,GEIST'S GRAVE,"We bid thee to thy vacant chair,"
8028,GEIST'S GRAVE,"We greet thee by the window-pane,"
8029,GEIST'S GRAVE,We hear thy scuffle on the stair;
8030,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8031,GEIST'S GRAVE,We see the flaps of thy large ears
8032,GEIST'S GRAVE,Quick raised to ask which way we go;
8033,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Crossing the frozen lake, appears"
8034,GEIST'S GRAVE,Thy small black figure on the snow!
8035,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8036,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Nor to us only art thou dear,"
8037,GEIST'S GRAVE,Who mourn thee in thine English home;
8038,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Thou hast thine absent master's tear,"
8039,GEIST'S GRAVE,Dropped by the far Australian foam.
8040,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8041,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Thy memory lasts both here and there,"
8042,GEIST'S GRAVE,And thou shalt live as long as we.
8043,GEIST'S GRAVE,And after that--thou dost not care!
8044,GEIST'S GRAVE,In us was all the world to thee.
8045,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8046,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Yet, fondly zealous for thy fame,"
8047,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Even to a date beyond our own,"
8048,GEIST'S GRAVE,We strive to carry down thy name
8049,GEIST'S GRAVE,By mounded turf and graven stone.
8050,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8051,GEIST'S GRAVE,"We lay thee, close within our reach,"
8052,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Here, where the grass is smooth and warm,"
8053,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Between the holly and the beech,"
8054,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Where oft we watched thy couchant form,"
8055,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8056,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Asleep, yet lending half an ear"
8057,GEIST'S GRAVE,To travelers on the Portsmouth road;--
8058,GEIST'S GRAVE,"There choose we thee, O guardian dear,"
8059,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Marked with a stone, thy last abode!"
8060,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8061,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Then some, who through this garden pass,"
8062,GEIST'S GRAVE,"When we too, like thyself, are clay,"
8063,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Shall see thy grave upon the grass,"
8064,GEIST'S GRAVE,"And stop before the stone, and say:"
8065,GEIST'S GRAVE,
8066,GEIST'S GRAVE,People who lived here long ago
8067,GEIST'S GRAVE,"Did by this stone, it seems, intend"

8756,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"There was a King in Brentford,--of whom no legends tell,"
8757,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"But who, without his glory,--could eat and sleep right well."
8758,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"His Polly's cotton nightcap--it was his crown of state,"
8759,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"He slept of evenings early,--and rose of mornings late."
8760,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,
8761,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"All in a fine mud palace,--each day he took four meals,"
8762,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"And for a guard of honor,--a dog ran at his heels."
8763,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"Sometimes to view his kingdoms,--rode forth this monarch good,"
8764,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,And then a prancing jackass--he royally bestrode.
8765,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,
8766,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"There were no costly habits--with which this King was cursed,"
8767,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,Except (and where's the harm on't)--a somewhat lively thirst;
8768,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"But people must pay taxes,--and Kings must have their sport;"
8769,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,So out of every gallon--His Grace he took a quart.
8770,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,
8771,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"He pleased the ladies round him,--with manners soft and bland;"
8772,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"With reason good, they named him,--the father of his land."
8773,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,Each year his mighty armies--marched forth in gallant show;
8774,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"Their enemies were targets,--their bullets they were tow."
8775,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,
8776,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"He vexed no quiet neighbor,--no useless conquest made,"
8777,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"But by the laws of pleasure,--his peaceful realm he swayed."
8778,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"And in the years he reigned,--through all this country wide,"
8779,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"There was no cause for weeping,--save when the good man died."
8780,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,
8781,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"The faithful men of Brentford,--do still their King deplore,"
8782,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"His portrait yet is swinging,--beside an alehouse door."
8783,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"And topers, tender-hearted,--regard his honest phiz,"
8784,THE KING OF BRENTFORD,"And envy times departed,--that knew a reign like his."

9957,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,It was six men of Indostan
9958,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"To learning much inclined,"
9959,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,Who went to see the Elephant
9960,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"(Though all of them were blind),"
9961,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,That each by observation
9962,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,Might satisfy his mind.
9963,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9964,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The First approached the Elephant,"
9965,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,And happening to fall
9966,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Against his broad and sturdy side,"
9967,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,At once began to bawl:
9968,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"""God bless me! but the Elephant"
9969,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a wall!"""
9970,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9971,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The Second, feeling of the tusk,"
9972,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Cried, ""Ho! what have we here"
9973,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,So very round and smooth and sharp?
9974,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,To me 'tis mighty clear
9975,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,This wonder of an Elephant
9976,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a spear!"""
9977,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9978,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The Third approached the animal,"
9979,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,And happening to take
9980,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The squirming trunk within his hands,"
9981,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,Thus boldly up and spake:
9982,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant"
9983,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a snake!"""
9984,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9985,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The Fourth reached out an eager hand,"
9986,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,And felt about the knee.
9987,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"""What most this wondrous beast is like"
9988,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;"
9989,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"""'Tis clear enough the Elephant"
9990,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a tree!"""
9991,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9992,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear,"
9993,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Said: ""E'en the blindest man"
9994,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,Can tell what this resembles most;
9995,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Deny the fact who can,"
9996,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,This marvel of an Elephant
9997,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a fan!"""
9998,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
9999,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,The Sixth no sooner had begun
10000,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"About the beast to grope,"
10001,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Than, seizing on the swinging tail"
10002,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"That fell within his scope,"
10003,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant"
10004,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Is very like a rope!"""
10005,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,
10006,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,And so these men of Indostan
10007,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Disputed loud and long,"
10008,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,Each in his own opinion
10009,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Exceeding stiff and strong,"
10010,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,"Though each was partly in the right,"
10011,THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT,And all were in the wrong!

10029,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"In the depths of his cell with its stone-covered floor,"
10030,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Resigning to thought his chimerical brain,"
10031,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Once formed the contrivance we now shall explain;
10032,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,But whether by magic's or alchemy's powers
10033,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"We know not; indeed, 'tis no business of ours."
10034,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10035,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Perhaps it was only by patience and care,"
10036,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"At last, that he brought his invention to bear."
10037,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"In youth 'twas projected, but years stole away,"
10038,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,And ere 'twas complete he was wrinkled and gray;
10039,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"But success is secure, unless energy fails;"
10040,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,And at length he produced the Philosopher's Scales.
10041,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10042,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"""What were they?"" you ask.  You shall presently see;"
10043,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,These scales were not made to weigh sugar and tea.
10044,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Oh no; for such properties wondrous had they,"
10045,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"That qualities, feelings, and thoughts they could weigh,"
10046,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Together with articles small or immense,"
10047,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,From mountains or planets to atoms of sense.
10048,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10049,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Naught was there so bulky but there it would lay,"
10050,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"And naught so ethereal but there it would stay,"
10051,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,And naught so reluctant but in it must go:
10052,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,All which some examples more clearly will show.
10053,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10054,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"The first thing he weighed was the head of Voltaire,"
10055,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Which retained all the wit that had ever been there;
10056,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"As a weight, he threw in the torn scrap of a leaf"
10057,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Containing the prayer of the penitent thief;
10058,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,When the skull rose aloft with so sudden a spell
10059,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,That it bounced like a ball on the roof of the cell.
10060,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10061,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"One time he put in Alexander the Great,"
10062,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"With the garment that Dorcas had made, for a weight;"
10063,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"And though clad in armor from sandals to crown,"
10064,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,The hero rose up and the garment went down.
10065,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10066,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"A long row of almshouses, amply endowed"
10067,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"By a well-esteemed Pharisee, busy and proud,"
10068,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Next loaded one scale; while the other was pressed
10069,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,By those mites the poor widow dropped into the chest:
10070,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Up flew the endowment, not weighing an ounce,"
10071,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"And down, down the farthing-worth came with a bounce."
10072,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10073,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,By further experiments (no matter how)
10074,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,He found that ten chariots weighed less than one plough;
10075,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"A sword with gilt trappings rose up in the scale,"
10076,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Though balanced by only a ten-penny nail;
10077,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"A shield and a helmet, a buckler and spear,"
10078,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Weighed less than a widow's uncrystallized tear.
10079,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10080,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"A lord and a lady went up at full sail,"
10081,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,When a bee chanced to light on the opposite scale;
10082,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Ten doctors, ten lawyers, two courtiers, one earl,"
10083,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Ten counsellors' wigs, full of powder and curl,"
10084,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"All heaped in one balance and swinging from thence,"
10085,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Weighed less than a few grains of candor and sense;
10086,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"A first-water diamond, with brilliants begirt,"
10087,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Than one good potato just washed from the dirt;
10088,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,Yet not mountains of silver and gold could suffice
10089,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"One pearl to outweigh,--'twas the Pearl of Great Price."
10090,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,
10091,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"Last of all, the whole world was bowled in at the grate,"
10092,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"With the soul of a beggar to serve for a weight,"
10093,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,When the former sprang up with so strong a rebuff
10094,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,That it made a vast rent and escaped at the roof!
10095,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"When balanced in air, it ascended on high,"
10096,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,"And sailed up aloft, a balloon in the sky;"
10097,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,While the scale with the soul in't so mightily fell
10098,THE PHILOSOPHER'S SCALES,That it jerked the philosopher out of his cell.

10111,THE MAIDEN AND THE LILY,Its beauty passed into my heart:
10112,THE MAIDEN AND THE LILY,"I know 'twas very silly,"

10760,THE CALF-PATH,
10761,THE CALF-PATH,"One day, through the primeval wood,"
10762,THE CALF-PATH,"A calf walked home, as good calves should;"
10763,THE CALF-PATH,"But made a trail all bent askew,"
10764,THE CALF-PATH,A crooked trail as all calves do.
10765,THE CALF-PATH,
10766,THE CALF-PATH,"Since then two hundred years have fled,"
10767,THE CALF-PATH,"And, I infer, the calf is dead."
10768,THE CALF-PATH,"But still he left behind his trail,"
10769,THE CALF-PATH,And thereby hangs my moral tale.
10770,THE CALF-PATH,
10771,THE CALF-PATH,The trail was taken up next day
10772,THE CALF-PATH,By a lone dog that passed that way;
10773,THE CALF-PATH,And then a wise bell-wether sheep
10774,THE CALF-PATH,"Pursued the trail o'er vale and steep,"
10775,THE CALF-PATH,"And drew the flock behind him, too,"
10776,THE CALF-PATH,As good bell-wethers always do.
10777,THE CALF-PATH,
10778,THE CALF-PATH,"And from that day, o'er hill and glade,"
10779,THE CALF-PATH,Through those old woods a path was made;
10780,THE CALF-PATH,"And many men wound in and out,"
10781,THE CALF-PATH,"And dodged, and turned, and bent about"
10782,THE CALF-PATH,And uttered words of righteous wrath
10783,THE CALF-PATH,Because 'twas such a crooked path.
10784,THE CALF-PATH,
10785,THE CALF-PATH,But still they followed--do not laugh--
10786,THE CALF-PATH,"The first migrations of that calf,"
10787,THE CALF-PATH,"And through this winding wood-way stalked,"
10788,THE CALF-PATH,Because he wobbled when he walked.
10789,THE CALF-PATH,
10790,THE CALF-PATH,"This forest path became a lane,"
10791,THE CALF-PATH,"That bent, and turned, and turned again;"
10792,THE CALF-PATH,"This crooked lane became a road,"
10793,THE CALF-PATH,Where many a poor horse with his load
10794,THE CALF-PATH,"Toiled on beneath the burning sun,"
10795,THE CALF-PATH,And traveled some three miles in one.
10796,THE CALF-PATH,And thus a century and a half
10797,THE CALF-PATH,They trod the footsteps of that calf.
10798,THE CALF-PATH,
10799,THE CALF-PATH,"The years passed on in swiftness fleet,"
10800,THE CALF-PATH,The road became a village street;
10801,THE CALF-PATH,"And this, before men were aware,"
10802,THE CALF-PATH,A city's crowded thoroughfare;
10803,THE CALF-PATH,And soon the central street was this
10804,THE CALF-PATH,Of a renowned metropolis;
10805,THE CALF-PATH,And men two centuries and a half
10806,THE CALF-PATH,Trod in the footsteps of that calf.
10807,THE CALF-PATH,
10808,THE CALF-PATH,Each day a hundred thousand rout
10809,THE CALF-PATH,Followed the zigzag calf about;
10810,THE CALF-PATH,And o'er his crooked journey went
10811,THE CALF-PATH,The traffic of a continent.
10812,THE CALF-PATH,A hundred thousand men were led
10813,THE CALF-PATH,By one calf near three centuries dead.
10814,THE CALF-PATH,"They followed still his crooked way,"
10815,THE CALF-PATH,And lost one hundred years a day;
10816,THE CALF-PATH,For thus such reverence is lent
10817,THE CALF-PATH,To well-established precedent.

10819,THE CALF-PATH,"A moral lesson this might teach,"
10820,THE CALF-PATH,Were I ordained and called to preach;

10822,THE CALF-PATH,"Along the calf-paths of the mind,"
10823,THE CALF-PATH,And work away from sun to sun
10824,THE CALF-PATH,To do what other men have done.
10825,THE CALF-PATH,"They follow in the beaten track,"
10826,THE CALF-PATH,"And out and in, and forth and back,"
10827,THE CALF-PATH,"And still their devious course pursue,"
10828,THE CALF-PATH,To keep the path that others do.
10829,THE CALF-PATH,
10830,THE CALF-PATH,"But how the wise old wood-gods laugh,"
10831,THE CALF-PATH,Who saw the first primeval calf!

12419,A GRIEVANCE,
12420,A GRIEVANCE,Dear Mr. Editor: I wish to say--
12421,A GRIEVANCE,"If you will not be angry at my, writing it--"
12422,A GRIEVANCE,"But I've been used, since childhood's happy day,"
12423,A GRIEVANCE,"When I have thought of something, to inditing it;"
12424,A GRIEVANCE,"I seldom think of things; and, by the way,"
12425,A GRIEVANCE,"Although this meter may not be exciting, it"
12426,A GRIEVANCE,"Enables one to be extremely terse,"
12427,A GRIEVANCE,Which is not what one always is in verse.
12428,A GRIEVANCE,
12429,A GRIEVANCE,"I used to know a man,--such things befall"
12430,A GRIEVANCE,The observant wayfarer through Fate's domain--
12431,A GRIEVANCE,"He was a man, take him for all in all,"
12432,A GRIEVANCE,We shall not look upon his like again;
12433,A GRIEVANCE,I know that statement's not original;
12434,A GRIEVANCE,"What statement is, since Shakespeare? or, since Cain,"
12435,A GRIEVANCE,"What murder?  I believe 'twas Shakespeare said it, or"
12436,A GRIEVANCE,Perhaps it may have been your Fighting Editor.
12437,A GRIEVANCE,
12438,A GRIEVANCE,"Though why an Editor should fight, or why"
12439,A GRIEVANCE,"A Fighter should abase himself to edit,"
12440,A GRIEVANCE,Are problems far too difficult and high
12441,A GRIEVANCE,For me to solve with any sort of credit.
12442,A GRIEVANCE,Some greatly more accomplished man than I
12443,A GRIEVANCE,Must tackle them: let's say then Shakespeare said it;
12444,A GRIEVANCE,"And, if he did not, Lewis Morris may"
12445,A GRIEVANCE,"(Or even if he did).  Some other day,"
12446,A GRIEVANCE,
12447,A GRIEVANCE,"When I have nothing pressing to impart,"
12448,A GRIEVANCE,I should not mind dilating on this matter.
12449,A GRIEVANCE,"I feel its import both in head and heart,"
12450,A GRIEVANCE,"And always did,--especially the latter."
12451,A GRIEVANCE,I could discuss it in the busy mart
12452,A GRIEVANCE,Or on the lonely housetop; hold! this chatter
12453,A GRIEVANCE,Diverts me from my purpose.  To the point:
12454,A GRIEVANCE,"The time, as Hamlet said, is out of joint,"
12455,A GRIEVANCE,
12456,A GRIEVANCE,"And perhaps I was born to set it right,--"

12459,A GRIEVANCE,I don't see any cause for cursing in it.  I
12460,A GRIEVANCE,Have always taken very great delight
12461,A GRIEVANCE,In such pursuits since first I read divinity.

13001,NEPHELIDIA,From the depth of the dreamy decline of the dawn through

13026,NEPHELIDIA,Surely no spirit or sense of a soul that was soft to the spirit
13027,NEPHELIDIA,and soul of our senses
13028,NEPHELIDIA,Sweetens the stress of suspiring suspicion that sobs in the

13037,NEPHELIDIA,"men's rapiers, resigned to the rod;"
13038,NEPHELIDIA,Made meek as a mother whose bosom-beats bound with the bliss-bringing
13039,NEPHELIDIA,"bulk of a balm-breathing baby,"

13041,NEPHELIDIA,green at a groan for the grimness of God.
13042,NEPHELIDIA,"Blank is the book of his bounty beholden of old, and its binding"
13043,NEPHELIDIA,is blacker than bluer:

13365,THE POETS AT TEA,I.--(Macaulay)
13366,THE POETS AT TEA,"Pour, varlet, pour the water,"
13367,THE POETS AT TEA,The water steaming hot!
13368,THE POETS AT TEA,"A spoonful for each man of us,"
13369,THE POETS AT TEA,Another for the pot!
13370,THE POETS AT TEA,"We shall not drink from amber,"
13371,THE POETS AT TEA,No Capuan slave shall mix
13372,THE POETS AT TEA,For us the snows of Athos
13373,THE POETS AT TEA,With port at thirty-six;
13374,THE POETS AT TEA,Whiter than snow the crystals
13375,THE POETS AT TEA,"Grown sweet 'neath tropic fires,"
13376,THE POETS AT TEA,"More rich the herb of China's field,"
13377,THE POETS AT TEA,The pasture-lands more fragrance yield;
13378,THE POETS AT TEA,Forever let Britannia wield
13379,THE POETS AT TEA,The teapot of her sires!

13381,THE POETS AT TEA,II.--(Tennyson)
13382,THE POETS AT TEA,I think that I am drawing to an end:
13383,THE POETS AT TEA,"For on a sudden came a gasp for breath,"
13384,THE POETS AT TEA,"And stretching of the hands, and blinded eyes,"
13385,THE POETS AT TEA,"And a, great darkness falling on my soul."
13386,THE POETS AT TEA,O Hallelujah!... Kindly pass the milk.
13387,THE POETS AT TEA,
13388,THE POETS AT TEA,III.--(Swinburne)
13389,THE POETS AT TEA,As the sin that was sweet in the sinning
13390,THE POETS AT TEA,"Is foul in the ending thereof,"
13391,THE POETS AT TEA,As the heat of the summer's beginning
13392,THE POETS AT TEA,Is past in the winter of love:
13393,THE POETS AT TEA,"O purity, painful and pleading!"
13394,THE POETS AT TEA,"O coldness, ineffably gray!"
13395,THE POETS AT TEA,"O hear us, our handmaid unheeding,"
13396,THE POETS AT TEA,And take it away!
13397,THE POETS AT TEA,
13398,THE POETS AT TEA,IV.--(Cowper)
13399,THE POETS AT TEA,"The cosy fire is bright and gay,"
13400,THE POETS AT TEA,The merry kettle boils away
13401,THE POETS AT TEA,And hums a cheerful song.
13402,THE POETS AT TEA,I sing the saucer and the cup;
13403,THE POETS AT TEA,"Pray, Mary, fill the teapot up,"
13404,THE POETS AT TEA,And do not make it strong.
13405,THE POETS AT TEA,
13406,THE POETS AT TEA,V.--(Browning)
13407,THE POETS AT TEA,Tut!  Bah!  We take as another case--
13408,THE POETS AT TEA,Pass the pills on the window-sill; notice the capsule
13409,THE POETS AT TEA,"(A sick man's fancy, no doubt, but I place"
13410,THE POETS AT TEA,"Reliance on trade-marks, Sir)--so perhaps you'll"
13411,THE POETS AT TEA,Excuse the digression--this cup which I hold
13412,THE POETS AT TEA,"Light-poised--Bah, it's spilt in the bed--well, let's on go--"
13413,THE POETS AT TEA,"Hold Bohea and sugar, Sir; if you were told"
13414,THE POETS AT TEA,"The sugar was salt, would the Bohea be Congo?"
13415,THE POETS AT TEA,
13416,THE POETS AT TEA,VI.--(Wordsworth)
13417,THE POETS AT TEA,"""Come, little cottage girl, you seem"
13418,THE POETS AT TEA,To want my cup of tea;
13419,THE POETS AT TEA,And will you take a little cream?
13420,THE POETS AT TEA,"Now tell the truth to me."""
13421,THE POETS AT TEA,
13422,THE POETS AT TEA,"She had a rustic, woodland grin,"
13423,THE POETS AT TEA,"Her cheek was soft as silk,"
13424,THE POETS AT TEA,"And she replied, ""Sir, please put in"
13425,THE POETS AT TEA,"A little drop of milk."""
13426,THE POETS AT TEA,
13427,THE POETS AT TEA,"""Why, what put milk into your head?"
13428,THE POETS AT TEA,"'Tis cream my cows supply;"""
13429,THE POETS AT TEA,"And five times to the child I said,"
13430,THE POETS AT TEA,"""Why, pig-head, tell me, why?"""
13431,THE POETS AT TEA,
13432,THE POETS AT TEA,"""You call me pig-head,"" she replied;"
13433,THE POETS AT TEA,"""My proper name is Ruth."
13434,THE POETS AT TEA,"I called that milk""--she blushed with pride--"
13435,THE POETS AT TEA,"""You bade me speak the truth."""
13436,THE POETS AT TEA,
13437,THE POETS AT TEA,VII.--(Poe)
13438,THE POETS AT TEA,Here's a mellow cup of tea--golden tea!
13439,THE POETS AT TEA,What a world of rapturous thought its fragrance brings to me!
13440,THE POETS AT TEA,"Oh, from out the silver cells"
13441,THE POETS AT TEA,How it wells!
13442,THE POETS AT TEA,How it smells!
13443,THE POETS AT TEA,"Keeping tune, tune, tune,"
13444,THE POETS AT TEA,To the tintinnabulation of the spoon.
13445,THE POETS AT TEA,And the kettle on the fire
13446,THE POETS AT TEA,"Boils its spout off with desire,"
13447,THE POETS AT TEA,With a desperate desire
13448,THE POETS AT TEA,And a crystalline endeavor
13449,THE POETS AT TEA,"Now, now to sit, or never,"
13450,THE POETS AT TEA,"On the top of the pale-faced moon,"
13451,THE POETS AT TEA,"But he always came home to tea, tea, tea, tea, tea,"
13452,THE POETS AT TEA,Tea to the n-th.

13455,THE POETS AT TEA,"The lilies lie in my lady's bower,"
13456,THE POETS AT TEA,"(O weary mother, drive the cows to roost),"
13457,THE POETS AT TEA,They faintly droop for a little hour;
13458,THE POETS AT TEA,My lady's head droops like a flower.
13459,THE POETS AT TEA,
13460,THE POETS AT TEA,She took the porcelain in her hand
13461,THE POETS AT TEA,"(O weary mother, drive the cows to roost);"
13462,THE POETS AT TEA,She poured; I drank at her command;
13463,THE POETS AT TEA,"Drank deep, and now--you understand!"
13464,THE POETS AT TEA,"(O weary mother, drive the cows to roost)."
13465,THE POETS AT TEA,
13466,THE POETS AT TEA,IX.--(Burns)
13467,THE POETS AT TEA,"Weel, gin ye speir, I'm no inclined,"

13475,THE POETS AT TEA,"One cup for my self-hood,"
13476,THE POETS AT TEA,"Many for you.  Allons, camerados, we will drink together,"
13477,THE POETS AT TEA,"O hand-in-hand!  That tea-spoon, please, when you've done with it."
13478,THE POETS AT TEA,What butter-colored hair you've got.  I don't want to be personal.
13479,THE POETS AT TEA,"All right, then, you needn't.  You're a stale-cadaver."

13481,THE POETS AT TEA,"Allons, from all bat-eyed formulas."

13492,WORDSWORTH,"Now roars, now murmurs with the changing sea,"
13493,WORDSWORTH,"Now birdlike pipes, now closes soft in sleep;"
13494,WORDSWORTH,And one is of an old half-witted sheep
13495,WORDSWORTH,"Which bleats articulate monotony,"
13496,WORDSWORTH,"And indicates that two and one are three,"
13497,WORDSWORTH,"That grass is green, lakes damp, and mountains steep:"
13498,WORDSWORTH,"And, Wordsworth, both are thine: at certain times,"
13499,WORDSWORTH,Forth from the heart of thy melodious rhymes
13500,WORDSWORTH,The form and pressure of high thoughts will burst;
13501,WORDSWORTH,At other times-good Lord! I'd rather be
13502,WORDSWORTH,"Quite unacquainted with the A, B, C,"
13503,WORDSWORTH,Than write such hopeless rubbish as thy worst.
