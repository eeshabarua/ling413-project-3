98,GRANT RICHARDS,1903
99,GRANT RICHARDS,
100,GRANT RICHARDS,
101,GRANT RICHARDS,
102,GRANT RICHARDS,
103,GRANT RICHARDS,"That model Miss, Jemima Jane"
104,GRANT RICHARDS,"Was very good, and very plain;"
105,GRANT RICHARDS,Her parents noticed with delight
106,GRANT RICHARDS,"How neat she was, and how polite."
107,GRANT RICHARDS,Sometimes her young companions came
108,GRANT RICHARDS,And begged she'd join them in a game.
109,GRANT RICHARDS,But it was never any use;
110,GRANT RICHARDS,"She'd make some civil, quiet excuse,"
111,GRANT RICHARDS,"And, ""Dear Mama,"" she'd whisp'ring say,"
112,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I love plain sewing more than play;"
113,GRANT RICHARDS,I hope you'll always think of me
114,GRANT RICHARDS,"As your own gentle, busy Bee!"""
115,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane rose at five. ""What for?"" you ask;"
116,GRANT RICHARDS,"And I reply, ""To con her task."""
117,GRANT RICHARDS,"She breakfasted on milk and bread,"
118,GRANT RICHARDS,Nor ever asked for aught instead;
119,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I like it best, because,"" said she,"
120,GRANT RICHARDS,"""'Tis wholesome for a child like me."""
121,GRANT RICHARDS,"She used to think it quite a treat,"
122,GRANT RICHARDS,To put her bed and chamber neat;
123,GRANT RICHARDS,"But she enjoyed--oh, better far!"
124,GRANT RICHARDS,Saying her tasks to her Mama.
125,GRANT RICHARDS,
126,GRANT RICHARDS,[Illustration: _Jane's Uncle_]
127,GRANT RICHARDS,
128,GRANT RICHARDS,"She took the air when these were done,"
129,GRANT RICHARDS,But she would never romp and run;
130,GRANT RICHARDS,"Prim and sedate she walked about,"
131,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her back quite straight, her toes turned out:"
132,GRANT RICHARDS,"And all the people, seeing this,"
133,GRANT RICHARDS,"Exclaimed, ""Oh, what a model Miss!"""
134,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane's Uncle, who lived far away,"
135,GRANT RICHARDS,"Sent her Mama a note one day,"
136,GRANT RICHARDS,Explaining that he found he had
137,GRANT RICHARDS,To spend a fortnight in Bagdad.
138,GRANT RICHARDS,"He had a daughter, and 'twas plain"
139,GRANT RICHARDS,He hoped that she might stay with Jane.
140,GRANT RICHARDS,"""She's a sad puss,"" he said, ""I own;"
141,GRANT RICHARDS,"But I can't leave the child alone."""
142,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I think,"" Mama said, in a fuss,"
143,GRANT RICHARDS,"""We can't have _her_ to stay with us:"
144,GRANT RICHARDS,I do not like my Jane to mix
145,GRANT RICHARDS,"With children who have naughty tricks."""
146,GRANT RICHARDS,"But Jane said, with a gentle smile,"
147,GRANT RICHARDS,"Plying her needle all the while,"
148,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Pray, let her come here, dear Mama,"
149,GRANT RICHARDS,With the permission of Papa;
150,GRANT RICHARDS,I have a hope that she might be
151,GRANT RICHARDS,Influenced for her good by me:
152,GRANT RICHARDS,For I could show her that she would
153,GRANT RICHARDS,"Be happier if she were good."""
154,GRANT RICHARDS,
155,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_She bought a rod that afternoon_""]"
156,GRANT RICHARDS,
157,GRANT RICHARDS,
158,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Ann was brought there by"
159,GRANT RICHARDS,"a serving man_""]"
160,GRANT RICHARDS,
161,GRANT RICHARDS,"At this her kind Mama relented,"
162,GRANT RICHARDS,"And, as her good Papa consented,"
163,GRANT RICHARDS,That very day her mother wrote
164,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her uncle quite a cordial note,"
165,GRANT RICHARDS,"Saying, ""I think that it is clear"
166,GRANT RICHARDS,"Your Ann should spend your absence here"""
167,GRANT RICHARDS,"As she expected Ann quite soon,"
168,GRANT RICHARDS,She bought a rod that afternoon.
169,GRANT RICHARDS,"And sure enough, next Tuesday, Ann"
170,GRANT RICHARDS,Was brought there by a serving-man.
171,GRANT RICHARDS,Alas! alas! it soon was plain
172,GRANT RICHARDS,She was not in the least like Jane!
173,GRANT RICHARDS,"She ran and laughed and romped about,"
174,GRANT RICHARDS,And raised a hubbub and a shout.
175,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Oh, fie!"" said Jane, ""Pray, cousin Ann,"
176,GRANT RICHARDS,"Do be more tranquil if you can."""
177,GRANT RICHARDS,"But Ann just laughed, and did not care,"
178,GRANT RICHARDS,And tweaked her cousin by the hair.
179,GRANT RICHARDS,"When they were out she climbed a tree,"
180,GRANT RICHARDS,"Which quite annoyed the ""busy Bee."""
181,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Fie, fie!"" she cried. Ann said ""Here goes:"""
182,GRANT RICHARDS,And aimed an acorn at her nose!
183,GRANT RICHARDS,"So Jane replied, ""My good Mama"
184,GRANT RICHARDS,"Shall know how rude and rough you are."""
185,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Your good Mama!"" said little Ann;"
186,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Well, if you want to tell, you can."""
187,GRANT RICHARDS,"She went away--went whistling too,"
188,GRANT RICHARDS,"Such a rude, boyish thing to do!"
189,GRANT RICHARDS,
190,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Aimed an acorn at her nose_""]"
191,GRANT RICHARDS,
192,GRANT RICHARDS,
193,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""'_Indeed, _indeed_, I would much rather"
194,GRANT RICHARDS,"not proceed_'""]"
195,GRANT RICHARDS,
196,GRANT RICHARDS,"They went home shortly after, so"
197,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane told Mama her tale of woe.
198,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I do not tell this tale from choice,"""
199,GRANT RICHARDS,"She said, in her most gentle voice;"
200,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I thought you ought to know, you see,"
201,GRANT RICHARDS,How cousin Ann climbed up a tree;
202,GRANT RICHARDS,"And when I chid in gentle fashion,"
203,GRANT RICHARDS,"She flew into a dreadful passion,"
204,GRANT RICHARDS,"And--dear Mama, indeed, _indeed_,"
205,GRANT RICHARDS,"I would much rather not proceed."""
206,GRANT RICHARDS,"But since her mother thought it best,"
207,GRANT RICHARDS,She dutifully told the rest.
208,GRANT RICHARDS,"--""She threw things at me, tore my hair,"
209,GRANT RICHARDS,"And _whistled_ as she left me there!"""
210,GRANT RICHARDS,"At this Mama looked grim and stern,"
211,GRANT RICHARDS,And said that Ann had much to learn;
212,GRANT RICHARDS,And that she really felt unable
213,GRANT RICHARDS,To have such naughty girls at table.
214,GRANT RICHARDS,So when the others supped that day
215,GRANT RICHARDS,"(Their stew smelt sav'ry by the way),"
216,GRANT RICHARDS,"Ann had to stand upon a seat,"
217,GRANT RICHARDS,And did not get a thing to eat;
218,GRANT RICHARDS,"While Jane kept slyly peeping round,"
219,GRANT RICHARDS,And swallowed with a sucking sound.
220,GRANT RICHARDS,And there poor Ann was forced to stay
221,GRANT RICHARDS,When supper was all cleared away.
222,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane's good Papa began to read
223,GRANT RICHARDS,A very solid book indeed;
224,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane took her work, and sat near by,"
225,GRANT RICHARDS,And pricked Ann's ankles on the sly.
226,GRANT RICHARDS,
227,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Pricked Ann's ankles on the sly_""]"
228,GRANT RICHARDS,
229,GRANT RICHARDS,
230,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Laughed at her look of pained surprise_""]"
231,GRANT RICHARDS,
232,GRANT RICHARDS,And there in fact Ann had to wait
233,GRANT RICHARDS,"Until the clock was striking eight,"
234,GRANT RICHARDS,When Jane's Mama believed it time
235,GRANT RICHARDS,"To say that ladies never climb,"
236,GRANT RICHARDS,"But that to fall into a pet,"
237,GRANT RICHARDS,"And fight, is more disgraceful yet!"
238,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her little loving, gentle Jane"
239,GRANT RICHARDS,Should not be treated so again.
240,GRANT RICHARDS,She added more. At last she said
241,GRANT RICHARDS,"Ann might come down, and go to bed."
242,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane gently whispered, ""Dear, you would"
243,GRANT RICHARDS,"Be happier if you were good."""
244,GRANT RICHARDS,"Ann mutter'd ""Pig!""--but no one heard"
245,GRANT RICHARDS,Her use that most improper word.
246,GRANT RICHARDS,It chanced that nearly every day
247,GRANT RICHARDS,The cousins quarrelled at their play.
248,GRANT RICHARDS,Good little Janie always ran
249,GRANT RICHARDS,And told Mama of naughty Ann;
250,GRANT RICHARDS,--Of how she tied Jane's flaxen hair
251,GRANT RICHARDS,"To the back portion of her chair,"
252,GRANT RICHARDS,"And when her cousin tried to rise,"
253,GRANT RICHARDS,Laughed at her look of pained surprise.
254,GRANT RICHARDS,"How she had torn Jane's Sunday skirt,"
255,GRANT RICHARDS,And squirted at her with a squirt!
256,GRANT RICHARDS,"--And how another evening, she"
257,GRANT RICHARDS,Slipped salt into Jane's dish of tea;
258,GRANT RICHARDS,And many another naughty feat
259,GRANT RICHARDS,Did Ann perform and Jane repeat.
260,GRANT RICHARDS,"When Ann called Jane a ""Tell-tale-tit,"""
261,GRANT RICHARDS,She went and told Mama of it.
262,GRANT RICHARDS,"She sighed, ""I wondered how she _could!_"
263,GRANT RICHARDS,"I long to help her to be good."""
264,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane's kind Mama, I need not say,"
265,GRANT RICHARDS,Behaved in the most prudent way;
266,GRANT RICHARDS,Correcting Ann in various ways
267,GRANT RICHARDS,And giving Jane much well-earned praise.
268,GRANT RICHARDS,
269,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Slipped salt into Jane's dish of tea_""]"
270,GRANT RICHARDS,
271,GRANT RICHARDS,
272,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Off she started at a run_""]"
273,GRANT RICHARDS,
274,GRANT RICHARDS,"Now in that village, every year"
275,GRANT RICHARDS,The people held a cattle fair;
276,GRANT RICHARDS,And stalls and tents and swings were seen
277,GRANT RICHARDS,Set up upon the village green.
278,GRANT RICHARDS,Now when the fair came round that spring
279,GRANT RICHARDS,Ann longed to go like anything.
280,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Oh, Aunt,"" she cried, ""do let us go!"""
281,GRANT RICHARDS,"And pouted when her Aunt said ""No."""
282,GRANT RICHARDS,"Next morning when out walking, Ann"
283,GRANT RICHARDS,Concocted such a naughty plan!
284,GRANT RICHARDS,"She had some money of her own,"
285,GRANT RICHARDS,And she would see the fair alone!
286,GRANT RICHARDS,(I hope no other little miss
287,GRANT RICHARDS,Has ever made a scheme like this.)
288,GRANT RICHARDS,"When she believed that no one saw,"
289,GRANT RICHARDS,"She slipped out at the big front door,"
290,GRANT RICHARDS,"And off she started at a run,"
291,GRANT RICHARDS,To see the shows and all the fun.
292,GRANT RICHARDS,Now little Jane sat prim and neat
293,GRANT RICHARDS,Upon the parlour window seat;
294,GRANT RICHARDS,"And so she saw her cousin go,"
295,GRANT RICHARDS,And guessed she meant to see the show.
296,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Mama!"" she murmured, with a sigh,"
297,GRANT RICHARDS,"""My cousin Ann has just run by;"
298,GRANT RICHARDS,"I sadly fear--but no! oh, no!"
299,GRANT RICHARDS,"It could not be to see the show."""
300,GRANT RICHARDS,Mama at once sent Betsy out
301,GRANT RICHARDS,To see what Ann could be about:
302,GRANT RICHARDS,And Betsy found her at the fair
303,GRANT RICHARDS,Watching a big performing bear;
304,GRANT RICHARDS,"And Betsy brought her to her Aunt,"
305,GRANT RICHARDS,"Altho' she fought and cried ""I shan't!"
306,GRANT RICHARDS,"I shan't go back! I won't go in!"""
307,GRANT RICHARDS,--And kicked poor Betsy on the shin.
308,GRANT RICHARDS,
309,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Watching a big performing bear_""]"
310,GRANT RICHARDS,
311,GRANT RICHARDS,
312,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Jane fetched the rod_""]"
313,GRANT RICHARDS,
314,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her Aunt, on hearing all, looked grave,"
315,GRANT RICHARDS,"And said, ""Is this how you behave?"
316,GRANT RICHARDS,"You disobeyed me, and you fought!"
317,GRANT RICHARDS,"--Go, Jane, and fetch the rod I bought."""
318,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane joyfully laid down her book,"
319,GRANT RICHARDS,And ran off with a merry look;
320,GRANT RICHARDS,"While Ann stood looking pale and queer,"
321,GRANT RICHARDS,"And wishing that ""Papa were here."""
322,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Miss, to your room!"" Mama said; so"
323,GRANT RICHARDS,Away poor Ann was forced to go.
324,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane fetched the rod, and said, ""Oh, why"
325,GRANT RICHARDS,Will my poor cousin be so sly?
326,GRANT RICHARDS,"I cannot bear,"" the child confessed,"
327,GRANT RICHARDS,"""To see my dear Mama distressed."""
328,GRANT RICHARDS,"Mama then took the rod, and went,"
329,GRANT RICHARDS,Leaving her daughter well content:
330,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane's gentle smile grew quite sublime,"
331,GRANT RICHARDS,For her Mama was gone some time.
332,GRANT RICHARDS,
333,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Jane's gentle smile grew quite sublime_""]"
334,GRANT RICHARDS,
335,GRANT RICHARDS,
336,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Hot and tired_""]"
337,GRANT RICHARDS,
338,GRANT RICHARDS,When twenty minutes had expired
339,GRANT RICHARDS,She came in looking hot and tired;
340,GRANT RICHARDS,"And very shortly after, she"
341,GRANT RICHARDS,Went out to drink a dish of tea
342,GRANT RICHARDS,"With several friends she long had known,"
343,GRANT RICHARDS,Leaving her little girl alone.
344,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane found it rather dull to read;
345,GRANT RICHARDS,She soon felt very dull indeed.
346,GRANT RICHARDS,How interesting Ann's tales had been
347,GRANT RICHARDS,About that circus she had seen.
348,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane wished Mama had let them go
349,GRANT RICHARDS,And see this cattle fair and show.
350,GRANT RICHARDS,She almost thought it would be fun
351,GRANT RICHARDS,"To go alone, as Ann had done."
352,GRANT RICHARDS,"""'Twill be her fault, if I _do_ go;"
353,GRANT RICHARDS,_She_ made me want to see the show.
354,GRANT RICHARDS,Mama will not suspect the plan
355,GRANT RICHARDS,"Because I told her about Ann,"""
356,GRANT RICHARDS,"She said, as she decided on it,"
357,GRANT RICHARDS,And went to fetch her beaver bonnet.
358,GRANT RICHARDS,"Betsy the maid was busy, so"
359,GRANT RICHARDS,Nobody saw Miss Janie go.
360,GRANT RICHARDS,Prim and particular and neat
361,GRANT RICHARDS,"She minced along the village street,"
362,GRANT RICHARDS,And safely reached the village green
363,GRANT RICHARDS,"Unnoticed, and in fact unseen."
364,GRANT RICHARDS,"Once there, Miss Jane, I grieve to say,"
365,GRANT RICHARDS,Behaved in quite a naughty way!
366,GRANT RICHARDS,"--She even rode a wooden horse,"
367,GRANT RICHARDS,"Though with propriety, of course;"
368,GRANT RICHARDS,She bought some sweetmeats at a stall
369,GRANT RICHARDS,And then sat down and ate them all;
370,GRANT RICHARDS,"She saw the clowns and acrobats,"
371,GRANT RICHARDS,And the performing dogs and cats.
372,GRANT RICHARDS,"She thought them very clever, yet"
373,GRANT RICHARDS,The pig-faced lady was her pet!
374,GRANT RICHARDS,
375,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_With propriety_""]"
376,GRANT RICHARDS,
377,GRANT RICHARDS,
378,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_A woman saw her tears_""]"
379,GRANT RICHARDS,
380,GRANT RICHARDS,"Soon it grew dark, and little Jane"
381,GRANT RICHARDS,Began to feel some drops of rain;
382,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her gown would spot, if it got wet;"
383,GRANT RICHARDS,And what a whipping she would get
384,GRANT RICHARDS,If kind Mama could ferret out
385,GRANT RICHARDS,What her dear child had been about.
386,GRANT RICHARDS,"If she got wet, they'd ask her ""Why?""--"
387,GRANT RICHARDS,And here poor Jane began to cry.
388,GRANT RICHARDS,A woman saw her tears--and saw
389,GRANT RICHARDS,The pretty necklace which she wore.
390,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Come, come!"" she said, ""my little Miss,"
391,GRANT RICHARDS,Don't spoil your pretty eyes like this;
392,GRANT RICHARDS,If you're afraid of getting wet
393,GRANT RICHARDS,"Come to my caravan, my pet,"
394,GRANT RICHARDS,And I'll be proud if Miss will take
395,GRANT RICHARDS,"A dish of tea and slice of cake."""
396,GRANT RICHARDS,"Jane thought the woman kind and nice,"
397,GRANT RICHARDS,And so she followed her advice:
398,GRANT RICHARDS,But after she had drunk her tea
399,GRANT RICHARDS,"She felt as drowsy as could be,"
400,GRANT RICHARDS,"And so, although she tried to keep"
401,GRANT RICHARDS,"Awake, she soon was fast asleep."
402,GRANT RICHARDS,"When she awoke, her head felt fit"
403,GRANT RICHARDS,"To fall to pieces, and to split;"
404,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her necklace and her clothes were gone,"
405,GRANT RICHARDS,And she had next to nothing on.
406,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her hair was short, and was--alack!"
407,GRANT RICHARDS,"No longer fair, but bluish black!"
408,GRANT RICHARDS,And she herself was--only think!
409,GRANT RICHARDS,Spotted all over brown and pink!
410,GRANT RICHARDS,"Too scared to cry, she rose and saw"
411,GRANT RICHARDS,"A giant, dwarf, and several more."
412,GRANT RICHARDS,"In fact, it soon was pretty plain"
413,GRANT RICHARDS,"These wicked men had stolen Jane,"
414,GRANT RICHARDS,"And meant to use her as a show,"
415,GRANT RICHARDS,"Dressed as a ""spotted child,"" you know."
416,GRANT RICHARDS,She struggled hard to be polite;
417,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Pray, sirs,"" she asked, ""can this be right?"""
418,GRANT RICHARDS,"""You 'old your bloomin' row!"" they said,"
419,GRANT RICHARDS,And rudely cuffed her on the head.
420,GRANT RICHARDS,
421,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""'_Pray, sirs,' she asked,"
422,GRANT RICHARDS,"'can this be right?_'""]"
423,GRANT RICHARDS,
424,GRANT RICHARDS,
425,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Quite fond of Ann_""]"
426,GRANT RICHARDS,
427,GRANT RICHARDS,"When Jane's Mama at length returned,"
428,GRANT RICHARDS,How dreadful was the news she learned!
429,GRANT RICHARDS,Her child was gone!--And it was vain
430,GRANT RICHARDS,To seek and search and call for Jane!
431,GRANT RICHARDS,They hunted for her everywhere--
432,GRANT RICHARDS,They even sought her at the fair;
433,GRANT RICHARDS,"But days went by, and then a week,"
434,GRANT RICHARDS,So that it seemed no use to seek.
435,GRANT RICHARDS,Oddly enough--Mama began
436,GRANT RICHARDS,"Really to feel quite fond of Ann,"
437,GRANT RICHARDS,Now that there was no virtuous Jane
438,GRANT RICHARDS,To carry tales and to complain.
439,GRANT RICHARDS,And Ann felt sorry for her Aunt
440,GRANT RICHARDS,"Altho' she said: ""I really can't"
441,GRANT RICHARDS,Conceive why it should cause her pain
442,GRANT RICHARDS,"To lose a little pig like Jane!"""
443,GRANT RICHARDS,Now that Ann's Aunt was left in peace
444,GRANT RICHARDS,She made excuses for her niece;
445,GRANT RICHARDS,"If she were noisy at her play,"
446,GRANT RICHARDS,"She said, ""I like to see her gay."""
447,GRANT RICHARDS,"And if she grew a trifle wild,"
448,GRANT RICHARDS,She only shook her head and smiled.
449,GRANT RICHARDS,"When Ann's Papa returned, one day,"
450,GRANT RICHARDS,"And came to fetch his child away,"
451,GRANT RICHARDS,"Mama was grieved to lose her niece,"
452,GRANT RICHARDS,"And proffered her a guinea-piece,"
453,GRANT RICHARDS,"Saying: ""You must stay longer, when"
454,GRANT RICHARDS,"You come to visit me again."""
455,GRANT RICHARDS,"Now all this time, poor Jane, we know,"
456,GRANT RICHARDS,Was made a laughing-stock and show.
457,GRANT RICHARDS,"They told her, did she dare explain"
458,GRANT RICHARDS,"That she was only little Jane,"
459,GRANT RICHARDS,"And not a spotted girl at all,"
460,GRANT RICHARDS,They'd beat her till she couldn't crawl.
461,GRANT RICHARDS,"She had to wait on all the rest,"
462,GRANT RICHARDS,And had to do her very best;
463,GRANT RICHARDS,
464,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Proffered her a guinea-piece_""]"
465,GRANT RICHARDS,
466,GRANT RICHARDS,
467,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_She had to wait on all the rest_""]"
468,GRANT RICHARDS,
469,GRANT RICHARDS,"So that, she sometimes quite forgot"
470,GRANT RICHARDS,Whether her back was straight or not!
471,GRANT RICHARDS,"And even, so the story goes,"
472,GRANT RICHARDS,Sometimes forgot to point her toes!
473,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane found the children in the van
474,GRANT RICHARDS,Were infinitely worse than Ann;
475,GRANT RICHARDS,"They punched her head and tore her hair,"
476,GRANT RICHARDS,"And pinched and nipped her everywhere,"
477,GRANT RICHARDS,"And when she said, ""A little child"
478,GRANT RICHARDS,"Ought to be tractable and mild!"""
479,GRANT RICHARDS,"They only made an ugly face,"
480,GRANT RICHARDS,And pinched her in another place.
481,GRANT RICHARDS,After a time this seemed to teach
482,GRANT RICHARDS,Jane it was better not to preach:
483,GRANT RICHARDS,"And even now and then, she would"
484,GRANT RICHARDS,Forget that she was very good.
485,GRANT RICHARDS,She wished it had not been her plan
486,GRANT RICHARDS,Always to tell Mama of Ann.
487,GRANT RICHARDS,"After two months had passed away,"
488,GRANT RICHARDS,She even might be heard to say
489,GRANT RICHARDS,That she had been a spiteful cat
490,GRANT RICHARDS,To treat her Cousin Ann like that!
491,GRANT RICHARDS,Now Jane's good parents went to stay
492,GRANT RICHARDS,With Ann's Papa one autumn day;
493,GRANT RICHARDS,"And while they both were staying there,"
494,GRANT RICHARDS,The people held a kind of fair.
495,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Pray, brother,"" Jane's Mama began,"
496,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Do let me take your little Ann;"
497,GRANT RICHARDS,"For she would like to see the show."""
498,GRANT RICHARDS,"And he replied, ""We all might go."""
499,GRANT RICHARDS,"And so that afternoon they went,"
500,GRANT RICHARDS,And gravely passed from tent to tent;
501,GRANT RICHARDS,"And finally, the party stept"
502,GRANT RICHARDS,Into the tent where freaks where kept.
503,GRANT RICHARDS,
504,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Gravely passed from tent to tent_""]"
505,GRANT RICHARDS,
506,GRANT RICHARDS,
507,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_And threw her arms round little Ann_""]"
508,GRANT RICHARDS,
509,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Look at that child,"" said one, ""I'm sure"
510,GRANT RICHARDS,"Her spots are paint and nothing more."""
511,GRANT RICHARDS,"Cried Ann: ""I do not care a fig"
512,GRANT RICHARDS,"For looking at that spotted pig!"""
513,GRANT RICHARDS,"But at her voice, Jane shrieked and ran,"
514,GRANT RICHARDS,And threw her arms round little Ann.
515,GRANT RICHARDS,"""Save me! oh, save me!"" she did plead;"
516,GRANT RICHARDS,"""I'm not a spotted pig, indeed!"""
517,GRANT RICHARDS,"While her Mama screamed out, ""You're not"
518,GRANT RICHARDS,"My Jane!""--and fainted on the spot."
519,GRANT RICHARDS,And her Papa desired to know
520,GRANT RICHARDS,Who was the master of the show?
521,GRANT RICHARDS,"But he, as afterwards transpired,"
522,GRANT RICHARDS,Had very modestly retired.
523,GRANT RICHARDS,Then everyone had much ado
524,GRANT RICHARDS,To bring Jane's fainting mother to:
525,GRANT RICHARDS,"At last she sat up with a start,"
526,GRANT RICHARDS,And pressed her darling to her heart.
527,GRANT RICHARDS,"""My Jane!"" she cried, ""my Jane!! my Jane!!!"""
528,GRANT RICHARDS,And seemed inclined to faint again.
529,GRANT RICHARDS,
530,GRANT RICHARDS,"[Illustration: ""_Fainted on the spot_""]"
531,GRANT RICHARDS,
532,GRANT RICHARDS,
533,GRANT RICHARDS,[Illustration]
534,GRANT RICHARDS,
535,GRANT RICHARDS,When Jane regained her native hearth
536,GRANT RICHARDS,She had a very thorough bath:
537,GRANT RICHARDS,"But tho' she used all soaps then known,"
538,GRANT RICHARDS,"And soda too, and pumice-stone,"
539,GRANT RICHARDS,She sadly saw she still had got
540,GRANT RICHARDS,More than one noticeable spot!
541,GRANT RICHARDS,And so poor Miss Jemima Jane
542,GRANT RICHARDS,"Tho' still more good, is still more plain."
543,GRANT RICHARDS,
