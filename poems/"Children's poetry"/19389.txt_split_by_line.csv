340,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
341,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
342,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"_Oh, hurry! hurry!_ here they come,"
343,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,The band in front with the big bass drum
344,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And blaring bugles,--there they are,"
345,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"On golden thrones in a golden car,"
346,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Tooting and fluting, oh, how grand!"
347,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Hi diddle, diddle!"
348,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,The fife and the fiddle!
349,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"_Hurrah, hurrah_ for the circus band!"
350,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
351,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And the red-plumed horses, oh, see them prance"
352,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And daintily lift their hoofs and dance,"
353,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,While beautiful ladies with golden curls
354,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Are jingling their bridles of gold and pearls,"
355,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And close behind
356,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Come every kind
357,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Of animal cages great and small,"
358,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,O how I wonder what's in them all!
359,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
360,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Here's one that's open and glaring there
361,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Is the shaggiest snow-white polar bear!
362,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,_Woof!_ but I wonder what we'd do
363,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"If his bars broke loose right now, don't you?"
364,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And O dear me!
365,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Just look and see
366,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,That pink-cheeked lady in skirts of gauze
367,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And the great big lion with folded paws!
368,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,O me! O my!
369,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,I'm glad that I
370,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Am not in that lion's cage, because"
371,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,_Suppose he'd open his horrible jaws!_
372,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,--But look! the clown is coming! Of course
373,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Facing the tail of a spotted horse
374,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And shouting out things to make folks laugh,"
375,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And grinning up at the tall giraffe
376,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,That placidly paces along and looks
377,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Just like giraffes in the picture-books!
378,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
379,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And there are the elephants, two and two,"
380,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Lumbering on as they always do!
381,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,The men who lead them look so small
382,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,I wonder the elephants mind at all
383,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,As they wag their queer
384,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Long trunks, and peer"
385,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Through their beady eyes,--folks say they know"
386,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"No end of things, and I'm sure it's so!"
387,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And you never must do a thing that's bad
388,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Or that possibly might make an elephant mad,"
389,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"For he'll never forgive you, it appears,"
390,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And will punish you sure, if it takes him _years!_"
391,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,So do not stare
392,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,But take good care
393,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"To mind your manners, and always try"
394,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,To smile politely as they go by!
395,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
396,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,But the camels don't care if you laugh at them
397,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"With their bumpy humps like a capital M,"
398,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,They lurch and sway
399,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"And seem to say,"
400,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"As they wrinkle their noses, long and gray,"
401,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"""This swaggering stride is quite the plan,"
402,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"It's the way we walked in the caravan!"""
403,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,
404,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And now more cages come rumbling by
405,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,With glittering people throned on high;
406,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"So many spangles and precious things,"
407,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,They surely must all be queens and kings!
408,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,They look so proud
409,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Above the crowd,"
410,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"O my, how fine it must feel to ride"
411,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,On golden wagons that hide inside
412,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Strange animals caught in cannibal isles
413,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And brought in ships for a million miles!
414,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,But hark! it's near
415,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"The end, for hear"
416,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,That sudden screeching in piercing key!
417,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"The steaming, screaming _cal-li-o-pe_!"
418,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,Just plain pianos sound terribly tame
419,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,"Beside this one with the wonderful name,"
420,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,And wouldn't you love some day to sit
421,THE CIRCUS PROCESSION,In a circus wagon and play on it?
