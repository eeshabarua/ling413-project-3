84,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
85,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
86,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"It chanced upon a certain day,"
87,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"When cheerful Summer, bright and gay,"
88,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Had brought once more her gift of flowers,"
89,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To dress anew her pleasant bowers;
90,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,When birds and insects on the wing
91,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Made all the air with music ring;
92,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"When sunshine smiled on dell and knoll,"
93,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Two Ducks set forth to take a stroll.
94,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,'Twas morning; and each grassy bank
95,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Of cooling dew had deeply drank--
96,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Each fair young flower was holding up
97,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Its sweet and freshly painted cup,"
98,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Filled with bright dew drops, every one;"
99,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Gay, sparkling treasures for the sun,"
100,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Who bears them lightly to the sky,"
101,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Holds them as vapor far on high,"
102,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Till with his rays in dazzling tints,"
103,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,The rainbow on the cloud he paints.
104,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"But our two Ducks we'll not forget,"
105,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,They were not troubled by the wet;
106,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"They rambled on, and soon they took"
107,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The path that led them to a brook,"
108,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
109,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,[Illustration]
110,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
111,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Whose sparkling waters danced along,"
112,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"With a gushing, rushing, rippling song."
113,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The ramblers, when they reached the brink,"
114,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Stepped down to bathe, and take a drink."
115,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"They loved to frolic, dive and dash"
116,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Beneath the water with a splash.
117,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"They washed and smoothed each glossy feather,"
118,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Then said, ""let's have a swim together!"""
119,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"As moving gracefully, they went,"
120,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,They heard loud tones of sad lament.
121,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"They listened, and did sharply look"
122,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,For cause of woe in that sweet brook;
123,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And soon espied beneath some bushes,"
124,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Among the reeds and tall, green rushes,"
125,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"A company of long-faced Frogs,"
126,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,A delegation from the bogs;
127,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Sitting with their up-turned faces,"
128,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"In attitudes to please the Graces,"
129,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Around a stone, on which was speaking"
130,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,A member of this grave marsh meeting.
131,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The Ducks were pleased; they knew them all,"
132,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,For very often they did call
133,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"At that sweet brook, to hear them sing;"
134,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,They thought their music quite the thing.
135,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"""And now,"" said they, ""we will draw near,"""
136,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,For much they wished to see and hear
137,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"What was this fuss and noise about,"
138,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,So joined the party to find out.
139,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The Frogs received them with a smirk,"
140,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And gave their hands with nervous jerk.
141,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Bowing and smiling in return,"
142,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,The Ducks prepared themselves to learn
143,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
144,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,[Illustration]
145,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
146,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"From what the Orator might say,"
147,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,The cause of all their friends' dismay.
148,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Now the chief speaker in this scene,"
149,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Dressed in a suit of bottle green,"
150,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Folding his arms across his breast,"
151,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Again the meeting thus addressed:
152,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"""My friends,"" said he, ""I'm rather hoarse,"
153,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And must be brief in my discourse;
154,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"But as these Ducks have joined our band,"
155,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,I wish to have them understand
156,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We have not come to this fair spot,"
157,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To break the peace or hatch a plot;
158,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,But we have met to form a plan
159,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"To waken in the heart of man,"
160,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Pity for our sad condition.
161,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We would present a grave petition,"
162,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Beseeching of the men who rule,"
163,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"That we, lone dwellers of the pool,"
164,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,May be permitted to reside
165,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"In safety, with our scanty tribe."
166,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We humbly say there's no occasion,"
167,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To send an army of invasion
168,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Into our loved and quiet bogs,"
169,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"To murder happy, harmless Frogs."
170,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Take our own dear sons and daughters,"
171,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Drag them from their winter quarters,"
172,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Then, when no heart with pity melts,"
173,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To cut them up as food for smelts!
174,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Think what a very shocking fate,"
175,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Caught and killed, and used as bait,"
176,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To take those harmless little fishes
177,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"To multiply man's dainty dishes."""
178,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Now, as the Frog this sentence spoke,"
179,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,_Each brother gave a solemn croak._
180,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,The gentleman in bottle-green
181,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Was quite exhausted by his theme;
182,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"He paused a moment, wiped his brow;"
183,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Then said, ""I think you will allow"
184,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We've been a persecuted race,"
185,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Since first on earth we had a place.
186,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"There is, I'm told, a land called France,"
187,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Where all the people sing and dance--
188,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And they acquire their easy grace
189,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,By living on our helpless race;
190,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And though I say it with a sigh,"
191,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"'Tis this that makes them all so spry."""
192,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Puffing for breath, the speaker stopped"
193,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And quickly from the stone he hopped.
194,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The Ducks, while listening to this tale,"
195,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Had felt their very hearts turn pale.
196,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"At length, the largest of the two,"
197,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"A handsome Drake, in green and blue,"
198,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Arose, and opening wide his beak,"
199,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"_Bowed, coughed_, and then began to speak."
200,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"""Neighbors, I'm not a coward bird--"
201,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"But the sad story I have heard,"
202,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Would cause the boldest one to quake,"
203,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And makes my every feather shake.
204,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"I like the plan that you propose,"
205,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"To write a list of these your woes,"
206,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And ask for mercy from these men;
207,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,But have it done by some smart pen;
208,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"If stated by some able writer,"
209,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"I think your fortunes may be brighter."""
210,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
211,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,[Illustration]
212,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
213,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Just at this moment, up there sprung"
214,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"A Frog quite pert, for one so young;"
215,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Said he, ""I vote for emigration,"
216,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"'Twill save us all this botheration!"""
217,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Our proud Drake turned, in great surprise,"
218,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,While grave rebuke flashed from his eyes.
219,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Said he, ""it makes my blood run cold,"
220,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To see young folks so smart and bold.
221,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"There's not a Duckling of my brood,"
222,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,That would presume to be thus rude;
223,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Young sir, I will a lesson give,"
224,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,That may be useful while you live:
225,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Wait till your counsel others seek,"
226,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And then think twice before you speak!
227,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"For you, the elders of this tribe,"
228,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,I hope you here will still reside.
229,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"In every pleasant brook and marsh,"
230,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,You'll meet with cares and trials harsh;
231,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"If you'll but try to be contented,"
232,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Much that's wrong will be prevented.
233,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"My lady Duck and I 'tis plain,"
234,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Are wiser than when here we came.
235,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We thought our lot was very hard,"
236,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,When shut within the poultry yard;
237,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Although 'tis large, and well supplied"
238,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"With water, and all else beside"
239,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"For happiness and comfort too,"
240,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Yet much we wished for something new.
241,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Our wings are clipped, we cannot fly,"
242,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And this too costs us many a sigh.
243,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We seldom pass our owner's gate,"
244,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,He keeps his poultry rather straight.
245,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We should not have been out to-day,"
246,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,But Duck and I just ran away;
247,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And as we came to bathe this morn,"
248,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Fretful we felt, and quite forlorn;"
249,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We thought our lot in life so sad,"
250,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And all our troubles quite too bad.
251,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Could we have got our brood away,"
252,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,We had quit town this very day.
253,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"As gloomily we stepped along,"
254,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,The air was filled with many a song
255,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"From happy creatures, gay and bright,"
256,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Rejoicing in the morning light.
257,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The dew, o'er flowers and trees was flung,"
258,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Like diamonds pure, in drops it hung;"
259,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"All nature seemed reproaching us,"
260,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,For making all this dismal fuss.
261,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"But we grew calmer as we walked,"
262,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Of all these cheering things we talked.
263,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And hearing all your griefs and sighs,"
264,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Much better feelings did arise.
265,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"For let me tell you, friends and brothers,"
266,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Listening to the woes of others,"
267,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And pitying their deep distress,"
268,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Will ever make our own seem less.
269,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Then Patience whispers, (pray regard her,)"
270,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Your lot though hard, might still be harder."
271,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Now, gossips, I am tired of speaking,"
272,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Our Ducklings too we must be seeking;
273,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Although it makes our heart-strings quiver,"
274,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,To see yon bright and pleasant river;
275,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And hearing its cool waters splashing,"
276,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,We long beneath them to be dashing.
277,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Yet we must close this visitation,"
278,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And without farther hesitation,"
279,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Resist our very strong desire,"
280,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And cheerful to our homes retire.
281,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Our kindest wishes rest with you,"
282,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"So, now good friends, we'll bid adieu."""
283,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The Ducks then smoothed each ruffled feather,"
284,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And gracefully walked off together.
285,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"The Frogs with courtesy arose,"
286,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And stretched themselves high on their toes;
287,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And so far conquered all their fears,"
288,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,They gave their friends three parting cheers!
289,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Then as they sank upon the grass,"
290,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,This resolution they did pass:
291,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"""Here, now, before we separate,"
292,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"We pledge ourselves, to bear our fate"
293,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"With patience; and if ill betide,"
294,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,We'll try to find some brighter side.
295,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Our homes with cheerful tones shall ring,"
296,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And over every care _we'll spring_."""
297,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,They stopped; each folded his green dress
298,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,About him with much cheerfulness;
299,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Shook hands all round, and said ""good day,"""
300,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Then merrily they _hopped away_.
301,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
302,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,[Illustration]
303,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
304,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"When these bright people all were gone,"
305,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"And I sat musing quite alone,"
306,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Out of this their simple preaching,"
307,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Came the lesson they'd been teaching.
308,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Each little reader too can see
309,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,What seems so very clear to me.
310,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
311,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,*       *       *       *       *
312,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,
313,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,'Tis this: that dark-browed Discontent
314,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,Must from our hearts be quickly sent;
315,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Whate'er may be our daily lot,"
316,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Think all is well, and grumble not;"
317,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"A generous pity feel for all,"
318,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And charity for great and small.
319,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"One other hint we also find,"
320,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"That children all should bear in mind,"
321,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Treat aged people--strangers too,"
322,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,With reverence; it is their due.
323,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"Take warning from that Frog so young,"
324,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,And keep a bridle on the tongue!
325,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,"These teachings seem so very plain,"
326,THE DUCKS AND THE FROGS,We hope they are not given in vain.
