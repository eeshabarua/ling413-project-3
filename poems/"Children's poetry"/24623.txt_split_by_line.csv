59,A FOREWORD,"Children, as well as their interested parents, will eagerly welcome this"
60,A FOREWORD,"beautiful edition of the one great nursery classic, just as a worthy"
61,A FOREWORD,edition of Shakespeare is welcomed by discriminating adult readers.
62,A FOREWORD,
63,A FOREWORD,"But some may ask what there is in these simple melodies, attributed to"
64,A FOREWORD,"Mother Goose, which gives them so secure and beloved a place in the"
65,A FOREWORD,"home, the school and the public library. Is it the humor, the action,"
66,A FOREWORD,"the rhythm, or the mystery of the theme which appeals so strongly to"
67,A FOREWORD,"critical little minds in each generation of childhood, and even to adult"
68,A FOREWORD,minds so fortunate as to have retained some of the refreshing naiveté of
69,A FOREWORD,early years?
70,A FOREWORD,
71,A FOREWORD,It is useless to try to explain the charm of these nonsense melodies.
72,A FOREWORD,The children themselves do not know why they love them. No mother can
73,A FOREWORD,tell us the magic of the spell which seems to be cast over her restless
74,A FOREWORD,baby as she croons to it a Mother Goose lullaby. No primary teacher
75,A FOREWORD,quite understands why the mere repetition or singing of a Mother Goose
76,A FOREWORD,"jingle will transform her listless, inattentive class into one all"
77,A FOREWORD,eagerness and attention. But mother and teacher agree that the best of
78,A FOREWORD,these verses have an even more potent influence than that of innocently
79,A FOREWORD,"diverting and entertaining the child. The healthy moral, so subtly"
80,A FOREWORD,"suggested in many of the rhymes, is unconsciously absorbed by the"
81,A FOREWORD,"child's receptive mind, helping him to make his own distinction between"
82,A FOREWORD,"right and wrong, bravery and cowardice, generosity and selfishness."
83,A FOREWORD,
84,A FOREWORD,"From a literary standpoint, also, these rhymes have proved of real value"
85,A FOREWORD,in creating a taste for the truly musical in poetry and song. They train
86,A FOREWORD,the ear and stir the imagination of the child as no other verses do.
87,A FOREWORD,"Many famous poets and writers trace their first inspiration, and love"
88,A FOREWORD,"for things literary, back to the nursery songs and fairy tales of their"
89,A FOREWORD,childhood.
90,A FOREWORD,
91,A FOREWORD,[Illustration]
92,A FOREWORD,
93,A FOREWORD,Teachers well know that children who have reveled in these rhymes and
94,A FOREWORD,"stories, at the time of their strongest appeal, step naturally and"
95,A FOREWORD,appreciatively into the great fields of good literature which are
96,A FOREWORD,beyond.
97,A FOREWORD,
98,A FOREWORD,"Knowing these things to be true, we do not hesitate to place this"
99,A FOREWORD,"venerable classic on the shelf beside our Shakespeare, and to send our"
100,A FOREWORD,children there for delight and inspiration. They will understand
101,A FOREWORD,Shakespeare the better for having known and loved Mother Goose.
102,A FOREWORD,
103,A FOREWORD,But what about the personality of this classic writer? Was she really
104,A FOREWORD,Mistress Elizabeth Goose who is said to have lived in Boston about two
105,A FOREWORD,"hundred years ago, and who crooned her nonsense jingles to a large and"
106,A FOREWORD,"happy family of grandchildren? We are told that their father, Thomas"
107,A FOREWORD,"Fleet, who was a printer by trade, thought to turn an honest penny with"
108,A FOREWORD,"his mother-in-law's popular verses, so he published them in a small"
109,A FOREWORD,"volume under the title of ""Songs for the Nursery: or, Mother Goose's"
110,A FOREWORD,"Melodies."" A goose with a very long neck and a wide-open mouth flew"
111,A FOREWORD,"across the title page, at least so the story goes. But we have to"
112,A FOREWORD,"believe that it is only a story, for no copy of the book can be found,"
113,A FOREWORD,"and nothing but tradition identifies Elizabeth Goose, the Boston"
114,A FOREWORD,"grandmother, with the famous rhymester."
115,A FOREWORD,
116,A FOREWORD,We might feel sorry to be obliged to discredit this picturesque story of
117,A FOREWORD,"Mother Goose, if her real history were not even more mysterious. We know"
118,A FOREWORD,"very little about the beloved patron of childhood, but what we do know"
119,A FOREWORD,is as follows:
120,A FOREWORD,
121,A FOREWORD,"Mother Goose is most certainly of respectable French origin, for in 1697"
122,A FOREWORD,"a distinguished French writer, Charles Perrault, published in Paris a"
123,A FOREWORD,"little book of familiar stories called ""Contes de ma Mère l'Oye,"" or"
124,A FOREWORD,"""Tales of My Mother Goose."" Her identity, however, he leaves a mystery,"
125,A FOREWORD,except that in the frontispiece of his book is pictured an old woman by
126,A FOREWORD,her fireside telling stories to an eager little family group.
127,A FOREWORD,
128,A FOREWORD,[Illustration]
129,A FOREWORD,
130,A FOREWORD,This volume contained the only prose tales that have ever been credited
131,A FOREWORD,"to Mother Goose, and they are still among the most popular stories in"
132,A FOREWORD,"nursery or school room. The titles are as follows: ""Little Red Riding"
133,A FOREWORD,"Hood;"" ""The Sisters Who Dropped From Their Mouths Diamonds and Toads;"""
134,A FOREWORD,"""Bluebeard;"" ""The Sleeping Beauty;"" ""Puss in Boots;"" ""Cinderella;"""
135,A FOREWORD,"""Riquet With the Tuft;"" and ""Tom Thumb."""
136,A FOREWORD,
137,A FOREWORD,"It is through her verses, however, that Mother Goose has won her"
138,A FOREWORD,well-deserved fame. The first collection under her name was published in
139,A FOREWORD,"London about 1765 by John Newbery. It may be, if Oliver Goldsmith were"
140,A FOREWORD,"living, he could tell us more about the origin of these verses than we"
141,A FOREWORD,are now ever likely to know. It is more than probable that he himself
142,A FOREWORD,"edited the little volume for John Newbery, and that he wrote the clever"
143,A FOREWORD,"preface, ""By a very Great Writer of very Little Books,"" as well as the"
144,A FOREWORD,quaint moral which supplements each rhyme.
145,A FOREWORD,
146,A FOREWORD,About twenty-five years later this book was reprinted in our country by
147,A FOREWORD,"Isaiah Thomas of Worcester, Massachusetts. Several copies of this"
148,A FOREWORD,"edition are preserved, one of which has been photographed and reproduced"
149,A FOREWORD,in facsimile by W. H. Whitmore of Boston. Other publishers also
150,A FOREWORD,"reprinted the English edition, one being done for John Newbery's"
151,A FOREWORD,"grandson, Francis Power, in 1791."
152,A FOREWORD,
153,A FOREWORD,In 1810 another collection of melodies appeared under the title of
154,A FOREWORD,"""Gammer Gurton's Garland."" It was quite evidently a rival of Mother"
155,A FOREWORD,"Goose, though it contained nearly all of her verses, besides many far"
156,A FOREWORD,less interesting ones gathered from other sources.
157,A FOREWORD,
158,A FOREWORD,[Illustration]
159,A FOREWORD,
160,A FOREWORD,"Gammer Gurton's popularity, however, was short, and Mother Goose was"
161,A FOREWORD,"revived about 1825 by a Boston firm, Munroe and Francis. Since that time"
162,A FOREWORD,her fame has never waned. In spite of the present multiplicity of
163,A FOREWORD,"beautiful books for children, they are constantly exhausting large"
164,A FOREWORD,editions of the one universally beloved book of melodies. Some of these
165,A FOREWORD,volumes have been collected and edited by men of the highest literary
166,A FOREWORD,"judgment and ability, such as Goldsmith (with hardly a doubt), Ritson,"
167,A FOREWORD,"Halliwell, Andrew Lang, Charles Eliot Norton, Charles Welsh and Edward"
168,A FOREWORD,Everett Hale. Certainly there is not another collection of juvenile
169,A FOREWORD,literature which can boast such a list of scholarly editors. The deepest
170,A FOREWORD,gratitude is due them for their careful and discriminating effort to
171,A FOREWORD,preserve for the children of future generations this rich heritage of
172,A FOREWORD,nursery melodies.
173,A FOREWORD,
174,A FOREWORD,"Many less discriminating editors, however, have ruthlessly mutilated and"
175,A FOREWORD,"adapted many of the rhymes to suit their fancy, thinking, possibly, that"
176,A FOREWORD,"as Mother Goose is only a title, the verses attributed to her belong to"
177,A FOREWORD,"the general public to use as it sees fit. On the contrary, Mother"
178,A FOREWORD,"Goose's melodies belong to the children, and no addition or change"
179,A FOREWORD,should be made except by those who are in such close sympathy with the
180,A FOREWORD,child-heart that they may act with the child's authority.
181,A FOREWORD,
182,A FOREWORD,"This present edition of ""Mother Goose"" preserves the best of the verses"
183,A FOREWORD,which became so popular in England and America as to first demand their
184,A FOREWORD,publication. It is the only truly classic edition that has been
185,A FOREWORD,published in modern times. The two authorities which have been followed
186,A FOREWORD,"are the edition published for John Newbery's grandson in London in 1791,"
187,A FOREWORD,"and probably edited by Oliver Goldsmith, and the edition published in"
188,A FOREWORD,"Boston in 1833 by Munroe and Francis, called ""The Only True Mother Goose"
189,A FOREWORD,"Melodies."" It is from this copy that the following quaint introduction"
190,A FOREWORD,"by ""Ma'am Goose"" is quoted."
191,A FOREWORD,
192,A FOREWORD,"Not all the favorites among the nursery rhymes are here, only those that"
193,A FOREWORD,first helped to make the fame of the fictitious but no less worthy
194,A FOREWORD,patron of childhood. May her fame and her melodies be lovingly preserved
195,A FOREWORD,to give joy and inspiration to many future generations of little
196,A FOREWORD,children.

212,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"pantaloons, some a deal younger, to be sure, but all monstrous wise and"
213,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"of my own family name. These old women, who never had chick or child of"
214,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"their own, but who always know how to bring up other people's children,"
215,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"will tell you with long faces that my enchanting, quieting, soothing"
216,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"volume, my all-sufficient anodyne for cross, peevish, won't-be-comforted"
217,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"little bairns, ought be laid aside for more learned books, such as"
218,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,_they_ could select and publish. Fudge! I tell you that all their
219,EULALIE OSGOOD GROVER,"batterings can't deface my beauties, nor their wise pratings equal my"
