95,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,
96,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,At Christmas Jessie had a pretty French doll given to her by her aunt
97,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"Amy. For weeks Jessie thought she had nothing more to wish for, but in"
98,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"the spring, however, when the days were warm and sunny, and nature"
99,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"called her out-of-doors, she found it rather inconvenient to take her"
100,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"dolly with her every time. She couldn't use her arms for anything else,"
101,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"you see, and like every other child, she liked to run and jump, and pick"
102,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"flowers and other things that caught her eye. But, like a good little"
103,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"mother, she thought her dolly needed the fresh air quite as much as"
104,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"herself; so one night, at the supper-table, she said: ""I wish I had a"
105,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"carriage for Bella, then I could leave her in that when I went for"
106,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"buttercups and violets."""
107,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,
108,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"Papa was present, and he heard her remark. In a few days Jessie's"
109,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"birthday would come, and both he and her mamma had been thinking of what"
110,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"they would give her then; for Jessie was such a good, gentle child,"
111,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"seldom teasing for what she could not have, that they always took"
112,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,especial care to remember her on such holidays.
113,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,
114,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"The innocent hint was just what he wanted. So on the birthday morn,"
115,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"Jessie found Bella seated in a beautiful little carriage, close beside"
116,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,her chair at the breakfast-table. You may be sure she was a very happy
117,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,"little girl then, and that she gave mamma and papa many loving hugs and"
118,THE NEW DOLL'S CARRIAGE,kisses for their thoughtfulness and love.

132,A TRUE STORY.,
133,A TRUE STORY.,"She was a dear child, only seven years old, and so anxious to have a"
134,A TRUE STORY.,friend all her own. One day I took her to Boston. She was wild with joy
135,A TRUE STORY.,at being allowed to take such a long trip in the cars. As the train
136,A TRUE STORY.,"steamed out from Newport, Josie's happy little face was pressed close to"
137,A TRUE STORY.,the window; but after a while she grew less interested in the fields
138,A TRUE STORY.,"outside, and more so in the passengers near us."
139,A TRUE STORY.,
140,A TRUE STORY.,"""O mamma!"" she whispered to me, ""do you see that little girl opposite? I"

142,A TRUE STORY.,
143,A TRUE STORY.,"The child she had noticed was indeed a sweet little girl, with hair"

146,A TRUE STORY.,
147,A TRUE STORY.,[Illustration]
148,A TRUE STORY.,
149,A TRUE STORY.,"But before we got to Boston my little girl had grown weary, and soon was"
150,A TRUE STORY.,"fast asleep. When we reached Boston she awoke, and saw her little friend"
151,A TRUE STORY.,"disappearing. Josie waved her hand to her, and then, to my great"
152,A TRUE STORY.,"surprise, shut her eyes tight."
153,A TRUE STORY.,
154,A TRUE STORY.,"""Why, darling,"" I said, ""didn't you hear mamma tell you this was Boston?"
155,A TRUE STORY.,"Don't go to sleep again; there are auntie and little Bess."""
156,A TRUE STORY.,
157,A TRUE STORY.,"""Mamma,"" she answered gravely, ""I was not going to sleep. I was asking"
158,A TRUE STORY.,"God to let that little girl be my friend."""
159,A TRUE STORY.,
160,A TRUE STORY.,"""But, my dear,"" I said, ""you live in Newport, and you have only seen her"
161,A TRUE STORY.,"in the cars. She probably lives in Boston. Come, auntie is hunting for"
162,A TRUE STORY.,"us."""
163,A TRUE STORY.,
164,A TRUE STORY.,"Josie had a fine time at auntie's, and her cousin Bess for a while"
165,A TRUE STORY.,"filled completely the position of friend. But the week over, and we were"
166,A TRUE STORY.,aboard the train for Newport; and Josie's mind was again filled with the
167,A TRUE STORY.,all-engrossing subject of--a friend.
168,A TRUE STORY.,
169,A TRUE STORY.,"We arrived at home in time for luncheon. Immediately after, Josie was in"
170,A TRUE STORY.,her room telling her sister all about her visit. Suddenly I heard a cry
171,A TRUE STORY.,"of joy. ""O mamma! mamma! There she is! God did send her."""
172,A TRUE STORY.,
173,A TRUE STORY.,"I hurried into Josie's room, and there at the window stood Josie,"
174,A TRUE STORY.,"holding up her doll, and smiling at the window of the next house."
175,A TRUE STORY.,
176,A TRUE STORY.,A second glance showed me that this was the very child we had seen in
177,A TRUE STORY.,the cars.
178,A TRUE STORY.,
179,A TRUE STORY.,"The little girls soon became acquainted, for little Carrie had come to"
180,A TRUE STORY.,"spend the winter with the Endicotts, who owned the house next our"

198,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"And he thought: ""How sorrowful she must be"
199,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"To know she can never have wings like me!"""
200,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"But the child passed on, with a careless eye"
201,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"Of the gay-winged, proud, young butterfly,"
202,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"While he fluttered about, as butterflies will,"

205,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"The butterfly spread his wings to the sky,"

209,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"But the child passed, with a lightsome heart,"

220,BUTTERFLY WISDOM.,"Then she tossed it up towards the wild-rose spray,"

242,MR. MONKEY.,
243,MR. MONKEY.,"Think what a proud monkey he must have been, dressed in a fine suit of"
244,MR. MONKEY.,clothes! Then to have every one look out of the window when he rung the
245,MR. MONKEY.,"bell, while he sat up on the corner of the hand-organ. And how the"
246,MR. MONKEY.,children laughed to see him! After he had called every one within
247,MR. MONKEY.,"hearing to look at him, he made a little bow and took off his hat very"
248,MR. MONKEY.,politely.
249,MR. MONKEY.,
250,MR. MONKEY.,[Illustration]
251,MR. MONKEY.,
252,MR. MONKEY.,"Then he put down the bell, and his master gave him cymbals, which he"

254,MR. MONKEY.,
255,MR. MONKEY.,How delighted all were to see that Mr. Monkey was a student! It was so
256,MR. MONKEY.,very queer to see the little scholar wearing those spectacles which the

261,MR. MONKEY.,
262,MR. MONKEY.,"Mr. Monkey would have made a good farmer, we all said, when we saw him"

267,MR. MONKEY.,
268,MR. MONKEY.,"Next came the fiddle, a nice little one, just the right size for a"
269,MR. MONKEY.,monkey to play. The hand-organ sounded very slowly while the little
270,MR. MONKEY.,monkey played his fiddle. For fear that his master would feel badly
271,MR. MONKEY.,"because he was so far behind, Mr. Monkey put away his instrument, and"
272,MR. MONKEY.,"bowed very low to the people, taking off his hat to thank them for the"
273,MR. MONKEY.,many pennies showered upon him.

282,A TRUE STORY.,
283,A TRUE STORY.,"Bertie Gale lived near a noisy little brook, which went singing through"
284,A TRUE STORY.,the meadow. Just below the house in which he lived was a dam. It made a
285,A TRUE STORY.,"large pond above it, and the water was used to turn the wheel of a small"
286,A TRUE STORY.,woollen-mill.
287,A TRUE STORY.,
288,A TRUE STORY.,"It was such fun to watch the water pouring over the wheel, turning it"
289,A TRUE STORY.,swiftly round and round.
290,A TRUE STORY.,
291,A TRUE STORY.,"Bertie was never tired of looking at it, but it made his mother very"
292,A TRUE STORY.,anxious if her little boy was long out of her sight. But he had promised
293,A TRUE STORY.,never to go into the water without permission.
294,A TRUE STORY.,
295,A TRUE STORY.,"But one summer the water was shut off for a while, and the mill was"
296,A TRUE STORY.,"silent. The old wheel was badly decayed and broken, and Mr. Gale said a"

300,A TRUE STORY.,
301,A TRUE STORY.,Every day Bertie hurried home from school to watch his father and the

303,A TRUE STORY.,
304,A TRUE STORY.,"One day when he came home, he ran down to the mill as usual. The wheel"
305,A TRUE STORY.,was in its place all ready for action.
306,A TRUE STORY.,
307,A TRUE STORY.,"How new and clean it looked! The workmen had gone, and no one was in"
308,A TRUE STORY.,sight.
309,A TRUE STORY.,
310,A TRUE STORY.,"""What a nice playhouse it would make,"" thought the boy. Then he stepped"

317,A TRUE STORY.,
318,A TRUE STORY.,Bertie did not finish his sentence. Suddenly there was a terrible
319,A TRUE STORY.,"roaring over his head, and the wheel began to go slowly around. The next"
320,A TRUE STORY.,"thing the boy knew he was lying upon a pile of blocks and shavings,"
321,A TRUE STORY.,"feeling very much as if he had been through his mother's sausage-mill,"
322,A TRUE STORY.,but very thankful that he was not still going around that swiftly-moving
323,A TRUE STORY.,"wheel. He was not very much hurt, but it was a long time before he cared"
324,A TRUE STORY.,to look at the water-wheel again.

335,JAMIE.,"three acts, and then he saw a man who had been giv-en the name of ""Paul"
336,JAMIE.,"Re-vere"" just for that play, be-cause he was go-ing to do some-thing"
337,JAMIE.,"such as a real and great Paul Revere once did, more than a hun-dred"

353,JAMIE.,"""I know it is-n't o-ver yet, mam-ma,"" said Jam-ie, ""but the ver-y next"

958,RUTH.,"""Great fun! Now that is what one says who knows nothing about it. It"

961,RUTH.,
962,RUTH.,"""When I was at Aunt Fanny's,"" said Ruth, ""she taught me how to make a"
963,RUTH.,kind of cake that we all liked. Uncle John said he could eat all I could

965,RUTH.,
966,RUTH.,"""Oh, Ruth, what a tease you are. Well, it will keep you quiet for a"
967,RUTH.,"while and I suppose you must learn somehow."""
968,RUTH.,
969,RUTH.,Then Ruth ran into the kitchen in high glee. First she looked at the
970,RUTH.,fire in the stove as Aunt Fanny had taught her to do. More coal was
971,RUTH.,needed. So she had to go down cellar and bring up as much as she could
972,RUTH.,in the hod. She opened the draughts and put on a little coal at first.
973,RUTH.,When that had kindled she put on a little more. She took a whisk and
974,RUTH.,swept out the stove oven. Then she put more water into the kettle on on
975,RUTH.,top of the stove. Soon it was time to close the draughts. She put her
976,RUTH.,hand into the oven to feel how hot it was just as she had seen her Aunt
977,RUTH.,Fanny do.

979,RUTH.,[Illustration]
980,RUTH.,
981,RUTH.,"When the stove was as she wanted it, Ruth ran out to the barn and found"
982,RUTH.,"four warm eggs in nests among the hay. These she brought into the house,"
983,RUTH.,"and breaking them into a bowl, began to beat them up quickly. Next she"
984,RUTH.,took a yellow dish from the dresser and put into it one cup of butter
985,RUTH.,and two cups of sugar. For a long time she mixed these two together
986,RUTH.,"until they were ""all one,"" as she called it."
987,RUTH.,
988,RUTH.,Next she put the four beaten eggs into the bowl with the butter and
989,RUTH.,"sugar, and beat them until her little hands ached. Then she measured out"
990,RUTH.,three cups of flour and sifted it into another dish. With this she put
991,RUTH.,"two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and then sifted flour and baking"
992,RUTH.,"powder together. After this was done, she added a little of it at a time"
993,RUTH.,"to the mixture of butter and eggs, beating away until all the flour had"
994,RUTH.,been used up. Then she put into it a teaspoonful of vanilla essence and
995,RUTH.,added enough milk to make a thick batter. Little pans shaped like hearts
996,RUTH.,"and rounds, and one large round pan were then well greased, and the"
997,RUTH.,beaten up cake put into each pan until it was half full. Then the pans
998,RUTH.,of cake were set into the oven and in ten or fifteen minutes all the
999,RUTH.,"tiny ""hearts and rounds"" were baked a light brown, while the large pan"
1000,RUTH.,had to stay baking ten or fifteen minutes more.
1001,RUTH.,
1002,RUTH.,A very happy child was young Ruth when she took out her pans of cake.
1003,RUTH.,
1004,RUTH.,"Her father, mother, brothers and the ""company"" who arrived the next day"
1005,RUTH.,"thought it the ""nicest cake ever made by so young a little girl."""
