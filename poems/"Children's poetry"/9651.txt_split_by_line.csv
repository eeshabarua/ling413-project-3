26,A CHILD-WORLD,_The Child-World--long and long since lost to view--
27,A CHILD-WORLD,A Fairy Paradise!--
28,A CHILD-WORLD,How always fair it was and fresh and new--
29,A CHILD-WORLD,How every affluent hour heaped heart and eyes
30,A CHILD-WORLD,With treasures of surprise!
31,A CHILD-WORLD,
32,A CHILD-WORLD,Enchantments tangible: The under-brink
33,A CHILD-WORLD,Of dawns that launched the sight
34,A CHILD-WORLD,"Up seas of gold: The dewdrop on the pink,"
35,A CHILD-WORLD,With all the green earth in it and blue height
36,A CHILD-WORLD,Of heavens infinite:
37,A CHILD-WORLD,
38,A CHILD-WORLD,"The liquid, dripping songs of orchard-birds--"
39,A CHILD-WORLD,"The wee bass of the bees,--"
40,A CHILD-WORLD,With lucent deeps of silence afterwards;
41,A CHILD-WORLD,"The gay, clandestine whisperings of the breeze"
42,A CHILD-WORLD,And glad leaves of the trees.

45,A CHILD-WORLD,
46,A CHILD-WORLD,O Child-World: After this world--just as when
47,A CHILD-WORLD,I found you first sufficed
48,A CHILD-WORLD,"My soulmost need--if I found you again,"
49,A CHILD-WORLD,"With all my childish dream so realised,"
50,A CHILD-WORLD,I should not be surprised._

119,THE CHILD-WORLD,
120,THE CHILD-WORLD,"A Child-World, yet a wondrous world no less,"
121,THE CHILD-WORLD,To those who knew its boundless happiness.
122,THE CHILD-WORLD,A simple old frame house--eight rooms in all--
123,THE CHILD-WORLD,Set just one side the center of a small
124,THE CHILD-WORLD,"But very hopeful Indiana town,--"
125,THE CHILD-WORLD,The upper-story looking squarely down
126,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Upon the main street, and the main highway"
127,THE CHILD-WORLD,"From East to West,--historic in its day,"
128,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Known as The National Road--old-timers, all"
129,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Who linger yet, will happily recall"
130,THE CHILD-WORLD,"It as the scheme and handiwork, as well"
131,THE CHILD-WORLD,"As property, of ""Uncle Sam,"" and tell"
132,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of its importance, ""long and long afore"
133,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Railroads wuz ever _dreamp_' of!""--Furthermore,"
134,THE CHILD-WORLD,The reminiscent first Inhabitants
135,THE CHILD-WORLD,Will make that old road blossom with romance
136,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of snowy caravans, in long parade"
137,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of covered vehicles, of every grade"
138,THE CHILD-WORLD,"From ox-cart of most primitive design,"
139,THE CHILD-WORLD,"To Conestoga wagons, with their fine"
140,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Deep-chested six-horse teams, in heavy gear,"
141,THE CHILD-WORLD,High names and chiming bells--to childish ear
142,THE CHILD-WORLD,And eye entrancing as the glittering train
143,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of some sun-smitten pageant of old Spain.
144,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And, in like spirit, haply they will tell"
145,THE CHILD-WORLD,"You of the roadside forests, and the yell"
146,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of ""wolfs"" and ""painters,"" in the long night-ride,"
147,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And ""screechin' catamounts"" on every side.--"
148,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of stagecoach-days, highwaymen, and strange crimes,"
149,THE CHILD-WORLD,And yet unriddled mysteries of the times
150,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Called ""Good Old."" ""And why 'Good Old'?"" once a rare"
151,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Old chronicler was asked, who brushed the hair"
152,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Out of his twinkling eyes and said,--""Well John,"
153,THE CHILD-WORLD,"They're 'good old times' because they're dead and gone!"""
154,THE CHILD-WORLD,
155,THE CHILD-WORLD,The old home site was portioned into three
156,THE CHILD-WORLD,Distinctive lots. The front one--natively
157,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Facing to southward, broad and gaudy-fine"
158,THE CHILD-WORLD,"With lilac, dahlia, rose, and flowering vine--"
159,THE CHILD-WORLD,"The dwelling stood in; and behind that, and"
160,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Upon the alley north and south, left hand,"
161,THE CHILD-WORLD,"The old wood-house,--half, trimly stacked with wood,"
162,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And half, a work-shop, where a workbench stood"
163,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Steadfastly through all seasons.--Over it,"
164,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Along the wall, hung compass, brace-and-bit,"
165,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And square, and drawing-knife, and smoothing-plane--"
166,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And little jack-plane, too--the children's vain"
167,THE CHILD-WORLD,Possession by pretense--in fancy they
168,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Manipulating it in endless play,"
169,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Turning out countless curls and loops of bright,"
170,THE CHILD-WORLD,Fine satin shavings--Rapture infinite!
171,THE CHILD-WORLD,Shelved quilting-frames; the toolchest; the old box
172,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of refuse nails and screws; a rough gun-stock's
173,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Outline in ""curly maple""; and a pair"
174,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of clamps and old krout-cutter hanging there.
175,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Some ""patterns,"" in thin wood, of shield and scroll,"
176,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Hung higher, with a neat ""cane-fishing-pole"""
177,THE CHILD-WORLD,And careful tackle--all securely out
178,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of reach of children, rummaging about."
179,THE CHILD-WORLD,
180,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Beside the wood-house, with broad branches free"
181,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Yet close above the roof, an apple-tree"
182,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Known as ""The Prince's Harvest""--Magic phrase!"
183,THE CHILD-WORLD,"That was _a boy's own tree_, in many ways!--"
184,THE CHILD-WORLD,Its girth and height meet both for the caress
185,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of his bare legs and his ambitiousness:
186,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And then its apples, humoring his whim,"
187,THE CHILD-WORLD,Seemed just to fairly _hurry_ ripe for him--
188,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Even in June, impetuous as he,"
189,THE CHILD-WORLD,"They dropped to meet him, halfway up the tree."
190,THE CHILD-WORLD,And O their bruised sweet faces where they fell!--
191,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And ho! the lips that feigned to ""kiss them _well_""!"
192,THE CHILD-WORLD,
193,THE CHILD-WORLD,"""The Old Sweet-Apple-Tree,"" a stalwart, stood"
194,THE CHILD-WORLD,In fairly sympathetic neighborhood
195,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of this wild princeling with his early gold
196,THE CHILD-WORLD,To toss about so lavishly nor hold
197,THE CHILD-WORLD,In bounteous hoard to overbrim at once
198,THE CHILD-WORLD,All Nature's lap when came the Autumn months.
199,THE CHILD-WORLD,Under the spacious shade of this the eyes
200,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of swinging children saw swift-changing skies
201,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of blue and green, with sunshine shot between,"
202,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And ""when the old cat died"" they saw but green."
203,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And, then, there was a cherry-tree.--We all"
204,THE CHILD-WORLD,And severally will yet recall
205,THE CHILD-WORLD,"From our lost youth, in gentlest memory,"
206,THE CHILD-WORLD,The blessed fact--There was a cherry-tree.
207,THE CHILD-WORLD,
208,THE CHILD-WORLD,There was a cherry-tree. Its bloomy snows
209,THE CHILD-WORLD,Cool even now the fevered sight that knows
210,THE CHILD-WORLD,No more its airy visions of pure joy--
211,THE CHILD-WORLD,As when you were a boy.
212,THE CHILD-WORLD,
213,THE CHILD-WORLD,There was a cherry-tree. The Bluejay set
214,THE CHILD-WORLD,His blue against its white--O blue as jet
215,THE CHILD-WORLD,He seemed there then!--But _now_--Whoever knew
216,THE CHILD-WORLD,He was so pale a blue!
217,THE CHILD-WORLD,
218,THE CHILD-WORLD,There was a cherry-tree--Our child-eyes saw
219,THE CHILD-WORLD,The miracle:--Its pure white snows did thaw
220,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Into a crimson fruitage, far too sweet"
221,THE CHILD-WORLD,But for a boy to eat.
222,THE CHILD-WORLD,
223,THE CHILD-WORLD,"There was a cherry-tree, give thanks and joy!--"
224,THE CHILD-WORLD,There was a bloom of snow--There was a boy--
225,THE CHILD-WORLD,There was a Bluejay of the realest blue--
226,THE CHILD-WORLD,And fruit for both of you.
227,THE CHILD-WORLD,
228,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Then the old garden, with the apple-trees"
229,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Grouped 'round the margin, and ""a stand of bees"""
230,THE CHILD-WORLD,"By the ""white-winter-pearmain""; and a row"
231,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of currant-bushes; and a quince or so.
232,THE CHILD-WORLD,"The old grape-arbor in the center, by"
233,THE CHILD-WORLD,"The pathway to the stable, with the sty"
234,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Behind it, and _upon_ it, cootering flocks"
235,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of pigeons, and the cutest ""martin-box""!--"
236,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Made like a sure-enough house--with roof, and doors"
237,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And windows in it, and veranda-floors"
238,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And balusters all 'round it--yes, and at"
239,THE CHILD-WORLD,Each end a chimney--painted red at that
240,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And penciled white, to look like little bricks;"
241,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And, to cap all the builder's cunning tricks,"
242,THE CHILD-WORLD,Two tiny little lightning-rods were run
243,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Straight up their sides, and twinkled in the sun."
244,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Who built it? Nay, no answer but a smile.--"
245,THE CHILD-WORLD,"It _may_ be you can guess who, afterwhile."
246,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Home in his stall, ""Old Sorrel"" munched his hay"
247,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And oats and corn, and switched the flies away,"
248,THE CHILD-WORLD,"In a repose of patience good to see,"
249,THE CHILD-WORLD,And earnest of the gentlest pedigree.
250,THE CHILD-WORLD,With half pathetic eye sometimes he gazed
251,THE CHILD-WORLD,Upon the gambols of a colt that grazed
252,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Around the edges of the lot outside,"
253,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And kicked at nothing suddenly, and tried"
254,THE CHILD-WORLD,"To act grown-up and graceful and high-bred,"
255,THE CHILD-WORLD,"But dropped, _k'whop!_ and scraped the buggy-shed,"
256,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Leaving a tuft of woolly, foxy hair"
257,THE CHILD-WORLD,Under the sharp-end of a gate-hinge there.
258,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Then, all ignobly scrambling to his feet"
259,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And whinneying a whinney like a bleat,"
260,THE CHILD-WORLD,He would pursue himself around the lot
261,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And--do the whole thing over, like as not!..."
262,THE CHILD-WORLD,Ah! what a life of constant fear and dread
263,THE CHILD-WORLD,And flop and squawk and flight the chickens led!
264,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Above the fences, either side, were seen"
265,THE CHILD-WORLD,"The neighbor-houses, set in plots of green"
266,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Dooryards and greener gardens, tree and wall"
267,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Alike whitewashed, and order in it all:"
268,THE CHILD-WORLD,The scythe hooked in the tree-fork; and the spade
269,THE CHILD-WORLD,"And hoe and rake and shovel all, when laid"
270,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Aside, were in their places, ready for"
271,THE CHILD-WORLD,The hand of either the possessor or
272,THE CHILD-WORLD,"Of any neighbor, welcome to the loan"
273,THE CHILD-WORLD,Of any tool he might not chance to own.
274,THE CHILD-WORLD,
275,THE CHILD-WORLD,
276,THE CHILD-WORLD,
277,THE CHILD-WORLD,
278,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS
279,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
280,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Such was the Child-World of the long-ago--
281,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The little world these children used to know:--
282,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Johnty, the oldest, and the best, perhaps,"
283,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of the five happy little Hoosier chaps
284,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Inhabiting this wee world all their own.--
285,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Johnty, the leader, with his native tone"
286,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of grave command--a general on parade
287,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Whose each punctilious order was obeyed
288,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,By his proud followers.
289,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
290,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,But Johnty yet--
291,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,After all serious duties--could forget
292,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The gravity of life to the extent,"
293,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"At times, of kindling much astonishment"
294,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"About him: With a quick, observant eye,"
295,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And mind and memory, he could supply"
296,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The tamest incident with liveliest mirth;
297,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And at the most unlooked-for times on earth
298,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Was wont to break into some travesty
299,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,On those around him--feats of mimicry
300,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of this one's trick of gesture--that one's walk--
301,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Or this one's laugh--or that one's funny talk,--"
302,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The way ""the watermelon-man"" would try"
303,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,His humor on town-folks that wouldn't buy;--
304,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,How he drove into town at morning--then
305,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,At dusk (alas!) how he drove out again.
306,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
307,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Though these divertisements of Johnty's were
308,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Hailed with a hearty glee and relish, there"
309,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Appeared a sense, on his part, of regret--"
310,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,A spirit of remorse that would not let
311,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Him rest for days thereafter.--Such times he,"
312,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"As some boy said, ""jist got too overly"
313,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Blame good fer common boys like us, you know,"
314,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,To '_so_ciate with--less'n we 'ud go
315,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And jine his church!"""
316,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
317,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Next after Johnty came
318,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"His little tow-head brother, Bud by name.--"
319,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And O how white his hair was--and how thick
320,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"His face with freckles,--and his ears, how quick"
321,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And curious and intrusive!--And how pale
322,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The blue of his big eyes;--and how a tale
323,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of Giants, Trolls or Fairies, bulged them still"
324,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Bigger and bigger!--and when ""Jack"" would kill"
325,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The old ""Four-headed Giant,"" Bud's big eyes"
326,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Were swollen truly into giant-size.
327,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And Bud was apt in make-believes--would hear
328,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"His Grandma talk or read, with such an ear"
329,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And memory of both subject and big words,"
330,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,That he would take the book up afterwards
331,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And feign to ""read aloud,"" with such success"
332,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,As caused his truthful elders real distress.
333,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,But he _must_ have _big words_--they seemed to give
334,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Extremer range to the superlative--
335,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"That was his passion. ""My Gran'ma,"" he said,"
336,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"One evening, after listening as she read"
337,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Some heavy old historical review--
338,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,With copious explanations thereunto
339,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Drawn out by his inquiring turn of mind,--"
340,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"""My Gran'ma she's read _all_ books--ever' kind"
341,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"They is, 'at tells all 'bout the land an' sea"
342,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,An' Nations of the Earth!--An' she is the
343,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Historicul-est woman ever wuz!"""
344,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,(Forgive the verse's chuckling as it does
345,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,In its erratic current.--Oftentimes
346,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The little willowy waterbrook of rhymes
347,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Must falter in its music, listening to"
348,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The children laughing as they used to do.)
349,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
350,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Who shall sing a simple ditty all about the Willow,"
351,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Dainty-fine and delicate as any bending spray
352,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,That dandles high the happy bird that flutters there to trill a
353,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Tremulously tender song of greeting to the May.
354,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
355,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Ah, my lovely Willow!--Let the Waters lilt your graces,--"
356,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"They alone with limpid kisses lave your leaves above,"
357,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Flashing back your sylvan beauty, and in shady places"
358,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Peering up with glimmering pebbles, like the eyes of love."
359,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
360,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Next, Maymie, with her hazy cloud of hair,"
361,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And the blue skies of eyes beneath it there.
362,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Her dignified and ""little lady"" airs"
363,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of never either romping up the stairs
364,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Or falling down them; thoughtful everyway
365,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of others first--The kind of child at play
366,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"That ""gave up,"" for the rest, the ripest pear"
367,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Or peach or apple in the garden there
368,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Beneath the trees where swooped the airy swing--
369,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"She pushing it, too glad for anything!"
370,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Or, in the character of hostess, she"
371,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Would entertain her friends delightfully
372,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"In her play-house,--with strips of carpet laid"
373,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Along the garden-fence within the shade
374,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of the old apple-trees--where from next yard
375,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Came the two dearest friends in her regard,"
376,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The little Crawford girls, Ella and Lu--"
377,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,As shy and lovely as the lilies grew
378,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"In their idyllic home,--yet sometimes they"
379,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Admitted Bud and Alex to their play,"
380,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Who did their heavier work and helped them fix
381,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"To have a ""Festibul""--and brought the bricks"
382,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And built the ""stove,"" with a real fire and all,"
383,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And stovepipe-joint for chimney, looming tall"
384,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And wonderfully smoky--even to
385,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Their childish aspirations, as it blew"
386,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And swooped and swirled about them till their sight
387,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Was feverish even as their high delight.
388,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Then Alex, with his freckles, and his freaks"
389,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of temper, and the peach-bloom of his cheeks,"
390,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And ""_amber-colored_ hair""--his mother said"
391,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"'Twas that, when others laughed and called it ""_red_"""
392,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And Alex threw things at them--till they'd call
393,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"A truce, agreeing ""'t'uz n't red _ut-tall_!"""
394,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
395,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,But Alex was affectionate beyond
396,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The average child, and was extremely fond"
397,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of the paternal relatives of his
398,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of whom he once made estimate like this:--

416,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Though what her lips missed, her dark eyes could say"

426,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,A lawyer and a leading citizen
427,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of the proud little town and county-seat--
428,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"His hopes his neighbors', and their fealty sweet)--"
429,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,He had known outdoor labor--rain and shine--
430,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Bleak Winter, and bland Summer--foul and fine."
431,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,So Nature had ennobled him and set
432,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Her symbol on him like a coronet:

434,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Superior of stature as of grace,"
435,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Even the children by the spell were wrought
436,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Up to heroics of their simple thought,"
437,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And saw him, trim of build, and lithe and straight"

439,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The towering ironweed the scythe had spared
440,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"For their sakes, when The Hired Man declared"

449,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Was purely fair, and haloed with a grace"
450,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And sweetness luminous when joy made glad

456,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Her brow, below her fair hair's glimmering strands,"

460,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,

476,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Her sewing--her workbasket on the floor
477,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Beside her,--Springtime through the open door"
478,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Balmily stealing in and all about
479,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The room; the bees' dim hum, and the far shout"
480,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And laughter of the children at their play,"
481,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And neighbor-children from across the way
482,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Calling in gleeful challenge--save alone
483,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,One boy whose voice sends back no answering tone--
484,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The boy, prone on the floor, above a book"
485,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of pictures, with a rapt, ecstatic look--"
486,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Even as the mother's, by the selfsame spell,"
487,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Is lifted, with a light ineffable--"
488,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"As though her senses caught no mortal cry,"

507,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And love might lend it comfort to the end,--"
508,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Whose yearnings, aches and stings."
509,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Over poor little things

550,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The bluebird's and the robin's trill are there,"
551,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Their sweet liquidity diluted some
552,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,By dewy orchard spaces they have come:
553,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Sounds of the town, too, and the great highway--"
554,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The Mover-wagons' rumble, and the neigh"
555,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of overtraveled horses, and the bleat"
556,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of sheep and low of cattle through the street--
557,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"A Nation's thoroughfare of hopes and fears,"
558,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,First blazed by the heroic pioneers

564,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,In mild remoteness falls the household din

567,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,With sudden pad and skurry of bare feet
568,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of little outlaws, in from field or street:"
569,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The clang of kettle,--rasp of damper-ring"

577,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The zest of hunger still incited on
578,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,To childish desperation by long-drawn
579,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Breaths of hot, steaming, wholesome things that stew"
580,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And blubber, and up-tilt the pot-lids, too,"
581,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Filling the sense with zestful rumors of
582,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The dear old-fashioned dinners children love:
583,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Redolent savorings of home-cured meats,"
584,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Potatoes, beans, and cabbage; turnips, beets"

587,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"To madness by new-grated fresh, keen, sharp"
588,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Horseradish--tang that sets the lips awarp
589,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And watery, anticipating all"

594,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of sweltering pudding, cake, and custard pie--"
595,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,The swooning-sweet aroma haunting all
596,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The house--upstairs and down--porch, parlor, hall"
597,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And sitting-room--invading even where
598,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The Hired Man sniffs it in the orchard-air,"
599,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And pauses in his pruning of the trees

602,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Then Cousin Rufus comes--the children hear

608,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,To have a cousin _grown_--and yet as young
609,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of soul and cheery as the songs he sung.
610,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
611,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,He was a student of the law--intent
612,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Soundly to win success, with all it meant;"
613,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And so he studied--even as he played,--"
614,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,With all his heart: And so it was he made
615,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,His gallant fight for fortune--through all stress
616,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of battle bearing him with cheeriness
617,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And wholesome valor.
618,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,
619,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And the children had
620,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Another relative who kept them glad

622,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"As blithe and sunny as the summer days,--"
623,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Their father's youngest brother--Uncle Mart.

625,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"""Baron Munchausen,"" too; and likewise ""The"
626,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Swiss Family Robinson.""--And when these three"
627,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Gave out, as he rehearsed them, he could go"
628,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Straight on in the same line--a steady flow
629,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Of arabesque invention that his good
630,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Old mother never clearly understood.
631,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"He _was_ to be a _printer_--wanted, though,"
632,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"To be an _actor_.--But the world was ""show"""

634,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Each day to him was jolly as a play.
635,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And some poetic symptoms, too, in sooth,"
636,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Were certain.--And, from his apprentice youth,"
637,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,He joyed in verse-quotations--which he took
638,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Out of the old ""Type Foundry Specimen Book."""
639,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,He craved and courted most the favor of

641,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And pleasing _them_, he pleased his own boy-heart"
642,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,And kept it young and fresh in every part.
643,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,So was it he devised for them and wrought
644,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"To life his quaintest, most romantic thought:--"
645,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Like some lone castaway in alien seas,"
646,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"He built a house up in the apple-trees,"
647,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Out in the corner of the garden, where"
648,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"No man-devouring native, prowling there,"
649,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Might pounce upon them in the dead o' night--
650,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"For lo, their little ladder, slim and light,"
651,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,They drew up after them. And it was known
652,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,That Uncle Mart slipped up sometimes alone
653,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And drew the ladder in, to lie and moon"
654,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Over some novel all the afternoon.
655,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And one time Johnty, from the crowd below,--"
656,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Outraged to find themselves deserted so--
657,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,Threw bodily their old black cat up in
658,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"The airy fastness, with much yowl and din."
659,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Resulting, while a wild periphery"
660,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Of cat went circling to another tree,"
661,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And, in impassioned outburst, Uncle Mart"
662,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"Loomed up, and thus relieved his tragic heart:"

682,THE OLD-HOME FOLKS,"And clatter of deflecting knife, and plate"

755,ALMON KEEFER,Hinging their bare shins in the mottled shine
756,ALMON KEEFER,"And shade, as they lay prone, or stretched supine"
757,ALMON KEEFER,"Beneath their favorite tree, with dreamy eyes"
758,ALMON KEEFER,And Argo-fandes voyaging the skies.
759,ALMON KEEFER,"""Tales of the Ocean"" was the name of one"
760,ALMON KEEFER,Old dog's-eared book that was surpassed by none
761,ALMON KEEFER,"Of all the glorious list.--Its back was gone,"
762,ALMON KEEFER,But its vitality went bravely on
763,ALMON KEEFER,In such delicious tales of land and sea
764,ALMON KEEFER,As may not ever perish utterly.
765,ALMON KEEFER,"Of still more dubious caste, ""Jack Sheppard"" drew"
766,ALMON KEEFER,"Full admiration; and ""Dick Turpin,"" too."
767,ALMON KEEFER,"And, painful as the fact is to convey,"
768,ALMON KEEFER,"In certain lurid tales of their own day,"
769,ALMON KEEFER,These boys found thieving heroes and outlaws
770,ALMON KEEFER,They hailed with equal fervor of applause:
771,ALMON KEEFER,"""The League of the Miami""--why, the name"
772,ALMON KEEFER,"Alone was fascinating--is the same,"
773,ALMON KEEFER,"In memory, this venerable hour"
774,ALMON KEEFER,"Of moral wisdom shorn of all its power,"
775,ALMON KEEFER,As it unblushingly reverts to when
776,ALMON KEEFER,"The old barn was ""the Cave,"" and hears again"
777,ALMON KEEFER,"The signal blown, outside the buggy-shed--"
778,ALMON KEEFER,"The drowsy guard within uplifts his head,"
779,ALMON KEEFER,"And ""'_Who goes there?_'"" is called, in bated breath--"
780,ALMON KEEFER,"The challenge answered in a hush of death,--"
781,ALMON KEEFER,"""Sh!--'_Barney Gray!_'"" And then ""'_What do you seek?_'"""
782,ALMON KEEFER,"""'_Stables of The League!_'"" the voice comes spent and weak,"
783,ALMON KEEFER,"For, ha! the _Law_ is on the ""Chieftain's"" trail--"
784,ALMON KEEFER,"Tracked to his very lair!--Well, what avail?"
785,ALMON KEEFER,"The ""secret entrance"" opens--closes.--So"
786,ALMON KEEFER,"The ""Robber-Captain"" thus outwits his foe;"
787,ALMON KEEFER,"And, safe once more within his ""cavern-halls,"""
788,ALMON KEEFER,He shakes his clenched fist at the warped plank-walls
789,ALMON KEEFER,And mutters his defiance through the cracks
790,ALMON KEEFER,At the balked Enemy's retreating backs
791,ALMON KEEFER,"As the loud horde flees pell-mell down the lane,"
792,ALMON KEEFER,And--_Almon Keefer_ is himself again!
793,ALMON KEEFER,
794,ALMON KEEFER,"Excepting few, they were not books indeed"
795,ALMON KEEFER,Of deep import that Almon chose to read;--
796,ALMON KEEFER,Less fact than fiction.--Much he favored those--
797,ALMON KEEFER,"If not in poetry, in hectic prose--"
798,ALMON KEEFER,"That made our native Indian a wild,"
799,ALMON KEEFER,Feathered and fine-preened hero that a child
800,ALMON KEEFER,Could recommend as just about the thing
801,ALMON KEEFER,"To make a god of, or at least a king."
802,ALMON KEEFER,Aside from Almon's own books--two or three--
803,ALMON KEEFER,His store of lore The Township Library
804,ALMON KEEFER,"Supplied him weekly: All the books with ""or""s--"
805,ALMON KEEFER,"Sub-titled--lured him--after ""Indian Wars,"""
806,ALMON KEEFER,"And ""Life of Daniel Boone,""--not to include"
807,ALMON KEEFER,"Some few books spiced with humor,--""Robin Hood"""
808,ALMON KEEFER,"And rare ""Don Quixote.""--And one time he took"
809,ALMON KEEFER,"""Dadd's Cattle Doctor.""... How he hugged the book"
810,ALMON KEEFER,"And hurried homeward, with internal glee"
811,ALMON KEEFER,And humorous spasms of expectancy!--
812,ALMON KEEFER,All this confession--as he promptly made
813,ALMON KEEFER,"It, the day later, writhing in the shade"
814,ALMON KEEFER,Of the old apple-tree with Johnty and
815,ALMON KEEFER,"Bud, Noey Bixler, and The Hired Hand--"
816,ALMON KEEFER,Was quite as funny as the book was not....
817,ALMON KEEFER,O Wonderland of wayward Childhood! what
818,ALMON KEEFER,"An easy, breezy realm of summer calm"
819,ALMON KEEFER,And dreamy gleam and gloom and bloom and balm
820,ALMON KEEFER,"Thou art!--The Lotus-Land the poet sung,"
821,ALMON KEEFER,It is the Child-World while the heart beats young....
822,ALMON KEEFER,
823,ALMON KEEFER,"While the heart beats young!--O the splendor of the Spring,"
824,ALMON KEEFER,"With all her dewy jewels on, is not so fair a thing!"
825,ALMON KEEFER,"The fairest, rarest morning of the blossom-time of May"
826,ALMON KEEFER,Is not so sweet a season as the season of to-day
827,ALMON KEEFER,"While Youth's diviner climate folds and holds us, close caressed,"
828,ALMON KEEFER,As we feel our mothers with us by the touch of face and breast;--
829,ALMON KEEFER,"Our bare feet in the meadows, and our fancies up among"
830,ALMON KEEFER,The airy clouds of morning--while the heart beats young.
831,ALMON KEEFER,
832,ALMON KEEFER,While the heart beats young and our pulses leap and dance.
833,ALMON KEEFER,"With every day a holiday and life a glad romance,--"
834,ALMON KEEFER,"We hear the birds with wonder, and with wonder watch their flight--"
835,ALMON KEEFER,"Standing still the more enchanted, both of hearing and of sight,"
836,ALMON KEEFER,"When they have vanished wholly,--for, in fancy, wing-to-wing"
837,ALMON KEEFER,"We fly to Heaven with them; and, returning, still we sing"
838,ALMON KEEFER,"The praises of this lower Heaven with tireless voice and tongue,"
839,ALMON KEEFER,Even as the Master sanctions--while the heart beats young.
840,ALMON KEEFER,
841,ALMON KEEFER,While the heart beats young!--While the heart beats young!
842,ALMON KEEFER,"O green and gold old Earth of ours, with azure overhung"
843,ALMON KEEFER,And looped with rainbows!--grant us yet this grassy lap of thine--
844,ALMON KEEFER,"We would be still thy children, through the shower and the shine!"
845,ALMON KEEFER,"So pray we, lisping, whispering, in childish love and trust"
846,ALMON KEEFER,With our beseeching hands and faces lifted from the dust
847,ALMON KEEFER,"By fervor of the poem, all unwritten and unsung,"
848,ALMON KEEFER,"Thou givest us in answer, while the heart beats young."

854,NOEY BIXLER,
855,NOEY BIXLER,Another hero of those youthful years
856,NOEY BIXLER,"Returns, as Noey Bixler's name appears."
857,NOEY BIXLER,And Noey--if in any special way--
858,NOEY BIXLER,Was notably good-natured.--Work or play
859,NOEY BIXLER,He entered into with selfsame delight--
860,NOEY BIXLER,A wholesome interest that made him quite
861,NOEY BIXLER,"As many friends among the old as young,--"
862,NOEY BIXLER,So everywhere were Noey's praises sung.
863,NOEY BIXLER,
864,NOEY BIXLER,"And he was awkward, fat and overgrown,"
865,NOEY BIXLER,"With a round full-moon face, that fairly shone"
866,NOEY BIXLER,As though to meet the simile's demand.
867,NOEY BIXLER,"And, cumbrous though he seemed, both eye and hand"
868,NOEY BIXLER,Were dowered with the discernment and deft skill
869,NOEY BIXLER,"Of the true artisan: He shaped at will,"
870,NOEY BIXLER,"In his old father's shop, on rainy days,"
871,NOEY BIXLER,"Little toy-wagons, and curved-runner sleighs;"
872,NOEY BIXLER,"The trimmest bows and arrows--fashioned, too."
873,NOEY BIXLER,"Of ""seasoned timber,"" such as Noey knew"
874,NOEY BIXLER,"How to select, prepare, and then complete,"
875,NOEY BIXLER,And call his little friends in from the street.
876,NOEY BIXLER,"""The very _best_ bow,"" Noey used to say,"
877,NOEY BIXLER,"""Haint made o' ash ner hick'ry thataway!--"
878,NOEY BIXLER,"But you git _mulberry_--the _bearin_'-tree,"
879,NOEY BIXLER,"Now mind ye! and you fetch the piece to me,"
880,NOEY BIXLER,"And lem me git it _seasoned_; then, i gum!"
881,NOEY BIXLER,I'll make a bow 'at you kin brag on some!
882,NOEY BIXLER,"Er--ef you can't git _mulberry_,--you bring"
883,NOEY BIXLER,"Me a' old _locus_' hitch-post, and i jing!"
884,NOEY BIXLER,I'll make a bow o' _that_ 'at _common_ bows
885,NOEY BIXLER,"Won't dast to pick on ner turn up their nose!"""
886,NOEY BIXLER,"And Noey knew the woods, and all the trees,"
887,NOEY BIXLER,"And thickets, plants and myriad mysteries"
888,NOEY BIXLER,Of swamp and bottom-land. And he knew where
889,NOEY BIXLER,"The ground-hog hid, and why located there.--"
890,NOEY BIXLER,"He knew all animals that burrowed, swam,"
891,NOEY BIXLER,"Or lived in tree-tops: And, by race and dam,"
892,NOEY BIXLER,"He knew the choicest, safest deeps wherein"
893,NOEY BIXLER,Fish-traps might flourish nor provoke the sin
894,NOEY BIXLER,"Of theft in some chance peeking, prying sneak,"
895,NOEY BIXLER,"Or town-boy, prowling up and down the creek."
896,NOEY BIXLER,All four-pawed creatures tamable--he knew
897,NOEY BIXLER,Their outer and their inner natures too;
898,NOEY BIXLER,"While they, in turn, were drawn to him as by"
899,NOEY BIXLER,Some subtle recognition of a tie
900,NOEY BIXLER,"Of love, as true as truth from end to end,"
901,NOEY BIXLER,Between themselves and this strange human friend.
902,NOEY BIXLER,"The same with birds--he knew them every one,"
903,NOEY BIXLER,"And he could ""name them, too, without a gun."""
904,NOEY BIXLER,"No wonder _Johnty_ loved him, even to"
905,NOEY BIXLER,The verge of worship.--Noey led him through
906,NOEY BIXLER,"The art of trapping redbirds--yes, and taught"
907,NOEY BIXLER,Him how to keep them when he had them caught--
908,NOEY BIXLER,"What food they needed, and just where to swing"
909,NOEY BIXLER,"The cage, if he expected them to _sing_."
910,NOEY BIXLER,
911,NOEY BIXLER,"And _Bud_ loved Noey, for the little pair"
912,NOEY BIXLER,Of stilts he made him; or the stout old hair
913,NOEY BIXLER,"Trunk Noey put on wheels, and laid a track"
914,NOEY BIXLER,Of scantling-railroad for it in the back
915,NOEY BIXLER,"Part of the barn-lot; or the cross-bow, made"
916,NOEY BIXLER,"Just like a gun, which deadly weapon laid"
917,NOEY BIXLER,"Against his shoulder as he aimed, and--""_Sping!_"""
918,NOEY BIXLER,He'd hear the rusty old nail zoon and sing--
919,NOEY BIXLER,And _zip!_ your Mr. Bluejay's wing would drop
920,NOEY BIXLER,A farewell-feather from the old tree-top!
921,NOEY BIXLER,"And _Maymie_ loved him, for the very small"
922,NOEY BIXLER,But perfect carriage for her favorite doll--
923,NOEY BIXLER,"A _lady's_ carriage--not a _baby_-cab,--"
924,NOEY BIXLER,"But oilcloth top, and two seats, lined with drab"
925,NOEY BIXLER,And trimmed with white lace-paper from a case
926,NOEY BIXLER,Of shaving-soap his uncle bought some place
927,NOEY BIXLER,At auction once.
928,NOEY BIXLER,
929,NOEY BIXLER,And _Alex_ loved him yet
930,NOEY BIXLER,"The best, when Noey brought him, for a pet,"
931,NOEY BIXLER,"A little flying-squirrel, with great eyes--"
932,NOEY BIXLER,"Big as a child's: And, childlike otherwise,"
933,NOEY BIXLER,"It was at first a timid, tremulous, coy,"
934,NOEY BIXLER,Retiring little thing that dodged the boy
935,NOEY BIXLER,"And tried to keep in Noey's pocket;--till,"
936,NOEY BIXLER,"In time, responsive to his patient will,"
937,NOEY BIXLER,"It became wholly docile, and content"
938,NOEY BIXLER,"With its new master, as he came and went,--"
939,NOEY BIXLER,"The squirrel clinging flatly to his breast,"
940,NOEY BIXLER,Or sometimes scampering its craziest
941,NOEY BIXLER,"Around his body spirally, and then"
942,NOEY BIXLER,Down to his very heels and up again.
943,NOEY BIXLER,
944,NOEY BIXLER,"And _Little Lizzie_ loved him, as a bee"
945,NOEY BIXLER,Loves a great ripe red apple--utterly.
946,NOEY BIXLER,For Noey's ruddy morning-face she drew
947,NOEY BIXLER,"The window-blind, and tapped the window, too;"
948,NOEY BIXLER,"Afar she hailed his coming, as she heard"
949,NOEY BIXLER,His tuneless whistling--sweet as any bird
950,NOEY BIXLER,"It seemed to her, the one lame bar or so"
951,NOEY BIXLER,"Of old ""Wait for the Wagon""--hoarse and low"
952,NOEY BIXLER,"The sound was,--so that, all about the place,"
953,NOEY BIXLER,"Folks joked and said that Noey ""whistled bass""--"
954,NOEY BIXLER,The light remark originally made
955,NOEY BIXLER,"By Cousin Rufus, who knew notes, and played"
956,NOEY BIXLER,"The flute with nimble skill, and taste as wall,"
957,NOEY BIXLER,"And, critical as he was musical,"
958,NOEY BIXLER,Regarded Noey's constant whistling thus
959,NOEY BIXLER,"""Phenominally unmelodious."""
960,NOEY BIXLER,"Likewise when Uncle Mart, who shared the love"
961,NOEY BIXLER,"Of jest with Cousin Rufus hand-in-glove,"
962,NOEY BIXLER,"Said ""Noey couldn't whistle '_Bonny Doon_'"
963,NOEY BIXLER,"Even! and, _he'd_ bet, couldn't carry a tune"
964,NOEY BIXLER,"If it had handles to it!"""
965,NOEY BIXLER,
966,NOEY BIXLER,--But forgive
967,NOEY BIXLER,"The deviations here so fugitive,"
968,NOEY BIXLER,"And turn again to Little Lizzie, whose"
969,NOEY BIXLER,High estimate of Noey we shall choose
970,NOEY BIXLER,Above all others.--And to her he was
971,NOEY BIXLER,Particularly lovable because
972,NOEY BIXLER,He laid the woodland's harvest at her feet.--
973,NOEY BIXLER,"He brought her wild strawberries, honey-sweet"
974,NOEY BIXLER,"And dewy-cool, in mats of greenest moss"
975,NOEY BIXLER,"And leaves, all woven over and across"
976,NOEY BIXLER,"With tender, biting ""tongue-grass,"" and ""sheep-sour,"""
977,NOEY BIXLER,"And twin-leaved beach-mast, prankt with bud and flower"
978,NOEY BIXLER,"Of every gypsy-blossom of the wild,"
979,NOEY BIXLER,"Dark, tangled forest, dear to any child.--"
980,NOEY BIXLER,"All these in season. Nor could barren, drear,"
981,NOEY BIXLER,White and stark-featured Winter interfere
982,NOEY BIXLER,With Noey's rare resources: Still the same
983,NOEY BIXLER,He blithely whistled through the snow and came
984,NOEY BIXLER,Beneath the window with a Fairy sled;
985,NOEY BIXLER,"And Little Lizzie, bundled heels-and-head,"
986,NOEY BIXLER,He took on such excursions of delight
987,NOEY BIXLER,"As even ""Old Santy"" with his reindeer might"
988,NOEY BIXLER,"Have envied her! And, later, when the snow"
989,NOEY BIXLER,Was softening toward Springtime and the glow
990,NOEY BIXLER,"Of steady sunshine smote upon it,--then"
991,NOEY BIXLER,Came the magician Noey yet again--
992,NOEY BIXLER,While all the children were away a day
993,NOEY BIXLER,Or two at Grandma's!--and behold when they
994,NOEY BIXLER,"Got home once more;--there, towering taller than"
995,NOEY BIXLER,"The doorway--stood a mighty, old Snow-Man!"
996,NOEY BIXLER,
997,NOEY BIXLER,A thing of peerless art--a masterpiece
998,NOEY BIXLER,Doubtless unmatched by even classic Greece
999,NOEY BIXLER,In heyday of Praxiteles.--Alone
1000,NOEY BIXLER,It loomed in lordly grandeur all its own.
1001,NOEY BIXLER,"And steadfast, too, for weeks and weeks it stood,"
1002,NOEY BIXLER,The admiration of the neighborhood
1003,NOEY BIXLER,As well as of the children Noey sought
1004,NOEY BIXLER,Only to honor in the work he wrought.
1005,NOEY BIXLER,"The traveler paid it tribute, as he passed"
1006,NOEY BIXLER,"Along the highway--paused and, turning, cast"
1007,NOEY BIXLER,"A lingering, last look--as though to take"
1008,NOEY BIXLER,"A vivid print of it, for memory's sake,"
1009,NOEY BIXLER,"To lighten all the empty, aching miles"
1010,NOEY BIXLER,"Beyond with brighter fancies, hopes and smiles."
1011,NOEY BIXLER,The cynic put aside his biting wit
1012,NOEY BIXLER,And tacitly declared in praise of it;
1013,NOEY BIXLER,And even the apprentice-poet of the town
1014,NOEY BIXLER,"Rose to impassioned heights, and then sat down"
1015,NOEY BIXLER,And penned a panegyric scroll of rhyme
1016,NOEY BIXLER,That made the Snow-Man famous for all time.
1017,NOEY BIXLER,
1018,NOEY BIXLER,"And though, as now, the ever warmer sun"
1019,NOEY BIXLER,Of summer had so melted and undone
1020,NOEY BIXLER,The perishable figure that--alas!--
1021,NOEY BIXLER,Not even in dwindled white against the grass--
1022,NOEY BIXLER,"Was left its latest and minutest ghost,"
1023,NOEY BIXLER,"The children yet--_materially_, almost--"
1024,NOEY BIXLER,Beheld it--circled 'round it hand-in-hand--
1025,NOEY BIXLER,(Or rather 'round the place it used to stand)--
1026,NOEY BIXLER,"With ""Ring-a-round-a-rosy! Bottle full"
1027,NOEY BIXLER,"O' posey!"" and, with shriek and laugh, would pull"

1094,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Of proud self-consciousness and vain conceit
1095,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,In their new finery.--Far up the street
1096,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"They called to Noey, as he came, that they,"
1097,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"As promised, both were going back that day"
1098,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,To _his_ house with him!
1099,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,
1100,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,And by time that each
1101,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Had one of Noey's hands--ceasing their speech
1102,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"And coyly anxious, in their new attire,"
1103,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"To wake the comment of their mute desire,--"
1104,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Noey seemed rendered voiceless. Quite a while
1105,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,They watched him furtively.--He seemed to smile
1106,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,As though he would conceal it; and they saw
1107,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"Him look away, and his lips purse and draw"
1108,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"In curious, twitching spasms, as though he might"
1109,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"Be whispering,--while in his eye the white"
1110,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Predominated strangely.--Then the spell
1111,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"Gave way, and his pent speech burst audible:"
1112,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"""They wuz two stylish little boys,"
1113,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"and they wuz mighty bold ones,"
1114,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Had two new pairs o' britches made
1115,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"out o' their daddy's old ones!"""
1116,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"And at the inspirational outbreak,"
1117,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Both joker and his victims seemed to take
1118,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,"An equal share of laughter,--and all through"
1119,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,Their morning visit kept recurring to
1120,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,The funny words and jingle of the rhyme
1121,A PROSPECTIVE VISIT,That just kept getting funnier all the time.

1127,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,
1128,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,At Noey's house--when they arrived with him--
1129,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"How snug seemed everything, and neat and trim:"
1130,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"The little picket-fence, and little gate--"
1131,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"It's little pulley, and its little weight,--"
1132,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"All glib as clock-work, as it clicked behind"
1133,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Them, on the little red brick pathway, lined"
1134,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,With little paint-keg-vases and teapots
1135,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Of wee moss-blossoms and forgetmenots:
1136,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"And in the windows, either side the door,"
1137,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Were ranged as many little boxes more
1138,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Of like old-fashioned larkspurs, pinks and moss"
1139,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,And fern and phlox; while up and down across
1140,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Them rioted the morning-glory-vines
1141,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"On taut-set cotton-strings, whose snowy lines"
1142,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Whipt in and out and under the bright green
1143,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Like basting-threads; and, here and there between,"
1144,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"A showy, shiny hollyhock would flare"
1145,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Its pink among the white and purple there.--
1146,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"And still behind the vines, the children saw"
1147,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"A strange, bleached, wistful face that seemed to draw"
1148,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"A vague, indefinite sympathy. A face"
1149,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,It was of some newcomer to the place.--
1150,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"In explanation, Noey, briefly, said"
1151,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"That it was ""Jason,"" as he turned and led"
1152,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,The little fellows 'round the house to show
1153,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Them his menagerie of pets. And so
1154,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,For quite a time the face of the strange guest
1155,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Was partially forgotten, as they pressed"
1156,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,About the squirrel-cage and rousted both
1157,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"The lazy inmates out, though wholly loath"
1158,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,To whirl the wheel for them.--And then with awe
1159,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"They walked 'round Noey's big pet owl, and saw"
1160,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Him film his great, clear, liquid eyes and stare"
1161,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,And turn and turn and turn his head 'round there
1162,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,The same way they kept circling--as though he
1163,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Could turn it one way thus eternally.
1164,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,
1165,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Behind the kitchen, then, with special pride"
1166,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Noey stirred up a terrapin inside
1167,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"The rain-barrel where he lived, with three or four"
1168,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Little mud-turtles of a size not more
1169,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,In neat circumference than the tiny toy
1170,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Dumb-watches worn by every little boy.
1171,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,
1172,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Then, back of the old shop, beneath the tree"
1173,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Of ""rusty-coats,"" as Noey called them, he"
1174,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Next took the boys, to show his favorite new"
1175,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Pet 'coon--pulled rather coyly into view
1176,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Up through a square hole in the bottom of
1177,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"An old inverted tub he bent above,"
1178,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Yanking a little chain, with ""Hey! you, sir!"

1184,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,
1185,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Here Noey's father called and sent him on
1186,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Some errand. ""Wait,"" he said--""I won't be gone"
1187,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"A half a' hour.--Take Bud, and go on in"
1188,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Where Jason is, tel I git back agin."""
1189,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,
1190,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Whoever _Jason_ was, they found him there"
1191,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Still at the front-room window.--By his chair
1192,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Leaned a new pair of crutches; and from one
1193,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Knee down, a leg was bandaged.--""Jason done"

1199,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Jason paid
1200,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,But little notice to the boys as they
1201,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Came in the room:--An idle volume lay
1202,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Upon his lap--the only book in sight--
1203,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"And Johnty read the title,--""Light, More Light,"
1204,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"There's Danger in the Dark,""--though _first_ and best--"
1205,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"In fact, the _whole_ of Jason's interest"
1206,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Seemed centered on a little _dog_--one pet
1207,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,Of Noey's all uncelebrated yet--
1208,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"Though _Jason_, certainly, avowed his worth,"
1209,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,And niched him over all the pets on earth--
1210,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,As the observant Johnty would relate
1211,AT NOEY'S HOUSE,"The _Jason_-episode, and imitate"

2640,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"My little story, Cousin Rufus said,"
2641,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Is not so much a story as a fact.
2642,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,It is about a certain willful boy--
2643,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"An aggrieved, unappreciated boy,"
2644,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Grown to dislike his own home very much,"
2645,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,By reason of his parents being not
2646,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,At all up to his rigid standard and
2647,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Requirements and exactions as a son
2648,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And disciplinarian.
2649,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2650,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"So, sullenly"
2651,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He brooded over his disheartening
2652,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Environments and limitations, till,"
2653,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"At last, well knowing that the outside world"
2654,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Would yield him favors never found at home,"
2655,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He rose determinedly one July dawn--
2656,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Even before the call for breakfast--and,"
2657,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Climbing the alley-fence, and bitterly"
2658,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Shaking his clenched fist at the woodpile, he"
2659,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Evanished down the turnpike.--Yes: he had,"
2660,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Once and for all, put into execution"
2661,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,His long low-muttered threatenings--He had
2662,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,_Run off!_--He had--had run away from home!
2663,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2664,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"His parents, at discovery of his flight,"
2665,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Bore up first-rate--especially his Pa,--"
2666,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Quite possibly recalling his own youth,"
2667,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And therefrom predicating, by high noon,"
2668,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The absent one was very probably
2669,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Disporting his nude self in the delights
2670,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Of the old swimmin'-hole, some hundred yards"
2671,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Below the slaughter-house, just east of town."
2672,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"The stoic father, too, in his surmise"
2673,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Was accurate--For, lo! the boy was there!"
2674,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2675,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And there, too, he remained throughout the day--"
2676,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Save at one starving interval in which
2677,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He clad his sunburnt shoulders long enough
2678,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"To shy across a wheatfield, shadow-like,"
2679,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And raid a neighboring orchard--bitterly,"
2680,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And with spasmodic twitchings of the lip,"
2681,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Bethinking him how all the other boys
2682,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Had _homes_ to go to at the dinner-hour--
2683,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,While _he_--alas!--_he had no home!_--At least
2684,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"These very words seemed rising mockingly,"
2685,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Until his every thought smacked raw and sour
2686,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And green and bitter as the apples he
2687,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,In vain essayed to stay his hunger with.
2688,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Nor did he join the glad shouts when the boys
2689,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Returned rejuvenated for the long
2690,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Wet revel of the feverish afternoon.--
2691,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Yet, bravely, as his comrades splashed and swam"
2692,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And spluttered, in their weltering merriment,"
2693,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"He tried to laugh, too,--but his voice was hoarse"
2694,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And sounded to him like some other boy's.
2695,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And then he felt a sudden, poking sort"
2696,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Of sickness at the heart, as though some cold"
2697,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And scaly pain were blindly nosing it
2698,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Down in the dreggy darkness of his breast.
2699,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The tensioned pucker of his purple lips
2700,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Grew ever chillier and yet more tense--
2701,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The central hurt of it slow spreading till
2702,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,It did possess the little face entire.
2703,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And then there grew to be a knuckled knot--
2704,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,An aching kind of core within his throat--
2705,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"An ache, all dry and swallowless, which seemed"
2706,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,To ache on just as bad when he'd pretend
2707,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He didn't notice it as when he did.
2708,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,It was a kind of a conceited pain--
2709,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"An overbearing, self-assertive and"
2710,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Barbaric sort of pain that clean outhurt
2711,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,A boy's capacity for suffering--
2712,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"So, many times, the little martyr needs"
2713,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Must turn himself all suddenly and dive
2714,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,From sight of his hilarious playmates and
2715,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Surreptitiously weep under water.
2716,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2717,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Thus
2718,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He wrestled with his awful agony
2719,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Till almost dark; and then, at last--then, with"
2720,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The very latest lingering group of his
2721,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Companions, he moved turgidly toward home--"
2722,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Nay, rather _oozed_ that way, so slow he went,--"
2723,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"With lothful, hesitating, loitering,"
2724,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Reluctant, late-election-returns air,"
2725,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Heightened somewhat by the conscience-made resolve
2726,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Of chopping a double-armful of wood
2727,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,As he went in by rear way of the kitchen.
2728,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And this resolve he executed;--yet
2729,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"The hired girl made no comment whatsoever,"
2730,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"But went on washing up the supper-things,"
2731,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Crooning the unutterably sad song, ""_Then think,"
2732,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Oh, think how lonely this heart must ever be!_"""
2733,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Still, with affected carelessness, the boy"
2734,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Ranged through the pantry; but the cupboard-door
2735,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Was locked. He sighed then like a wet fore-stick
2736,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And went out on the porch.--At least the pump,"
2737,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"He prophesied, would meet him kindly and"
2738,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Shake hands with him and welcome his return!
2739,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And long he held the old tin dipper up--
2740,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And oh, how fresh and pure and sweet the draught!"
2741,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Over the upturned brim, with grateful eyes"
2742,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"He saw the back-yard, in the gathering night,"
2743,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Vague, dim and lonesome, but it all looked good:"
2744,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"The lightning-bugs, against the grape-vines, blinked"
2745,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,A sort of sallow gladness over his
2746,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Home-coming, with this softening of the heart."
2747,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He did not leave the dipper carelessly
2748,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,In the milk-trough.--No: he hung it back upon
2749,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Its old nail thoughtfully--even tenderly.
2750,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,All slowly then he turned and sauntered toward
2751,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"The rain-barrel at the corner of the house,"
2752,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And, pausing, peered into it at the few"
2753,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Faint stars reflected there. Then--moved by some
2754,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Strange impulse new to him--he washed his feet.
2755,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He then went in the house--straight on into
2756,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The very room where sat his parents by
2757,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The evening lamp.--The father all intent
2758,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Reading his paper, and the mother quite"
2759,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,As intent with her sewing. Neither looked
2760,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Up at his entrance--even reproachfully,--"
2761,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And neither spoke.
2762,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2763,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,The wistful runaway
2764,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Drew a long, quavering breath, and then sat down"
2765,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Upon the extreme edge of a chair. And all
2766,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Was very still there for a long, long while.--"
2767,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Yet everything, someway, seemed _restful_-like"
2768,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And _homey_ and old-fashioned, good and kind,"
2769,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And sort of _kin_ to him!--Only too _still!_
2770,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,If somebody would say something--just _speak_--
2771,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Or even rise up suddenly and come
2772,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And lift him by the ear sheer off his chair--
2773,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Or box his jaws--Lord bless 'em!--_any_thing!--
2774,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Was he not there to thankfully accept
2775,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Any reception from parental source
2776,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Save this incomprehensible _voicelessness_.
2777,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,O but the silence held its very breath!
2778,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,If but the ticking clock would only _strike_
2779,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And for an instant drown the whispering,"
2780,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Lisping, sifting sound the katydids"
2781,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Made outside in the grassy nowhere.
2782,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2783,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Far
2784,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Down some back-street he heard the faint halloo
2785,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Of boys at their night-game of ""Town-fox,"""
2786,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,But now with no desire at all to be
2787,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Participating in their sport--No; no;--
2788,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Never again in this world would he want
2789,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,To join them there!--he only wanted just
2790,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,To stay in home of nights--Always--always--
2791,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Forever and a day!
2792,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,
2793,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,He moved; and coughed--
2794,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"Coughed hoarsely, too, through his rolled tongue; and yet"
2795,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,No vaguest of parental notice or
2796,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Solicitude in answer--no response--
2797,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,No word--no look. O it was deathly still!--
2798,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,So still it was that really he could not
2799,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Remember any prior silence that
2800,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,At all approached it in profundity
2801,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And depth and density of utter hush.
2802,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"He felt that he himself must break it: So,"
2803,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Summoning every subtle artifice
2804,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,Of seeming nonchalance and native ease
2805,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"And naturalness of utterance to his aid,"
2806,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,And gazing raptly at the house-cat where
2807,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,She lay curled in her wonted corner of
2808,COUSIN RUFUS' STORY,"The hearth-rug, dozing, he spoke airily"
