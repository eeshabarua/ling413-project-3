39,SUGAR AND SPICE.,"Our dear children gave a party,"

44,SUGAR AND SPICE.,"""One must,"" said they, ""a servant be,"""

95,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.
96,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
97,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
98,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,Young Franky's boots were sent to be mended. The girl came back and said
99,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,they would not be done for a week; the cobbler was so busy.
100,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
101,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"Annie, of the same family, who knew nothing of this, sent hers, and said"
102,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,they must be done by the next day.
103,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
104,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"The cobbler said if they brought him two pairs again to do at once, he'd"
105,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"knock their heads together with his lasts, and then give them a good"
106,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"""welting."" He was the only cobbler in the village, or he would not have"
107,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,been so independent.
108,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
109,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,Franky had often watched the boot-maker at his work; so he coaxed his
110,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"father to let him have some money to buy tools and leather, in order"
111,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,that he and his sisters might play at making boots and shoes.
112,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
113,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"He set to work, and they had such fun!"
114,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
115,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,Annie came and asked young master cobbler what time it was; and Franky
116,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"pretended to hit her on the head with a last, and said it had ""just"
117,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"struck one."" Then he measured her, and cut out his vamps, sides,"
118,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"linings, welts, soles, and heels. Next he made a soft-like sock of"
119,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"leather. This he turned inside out, and did his best to sew on a welt."
120,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
121,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"The boot was turned out right again, and then he sewed on a thin sole,"
122,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,and over this nailed another. The heel he formed by fastening little
123,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,bits of leather one upon the other.
124,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
125,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"After all this, he took a piece of common glass, and scraped the sides"
126,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"and bottoms of the soles, and heel-balled the sides of the soles and"
127,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"heels, and the boots were made. He did not try any other ornamental"
128,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,work. Of course the young lad could not do this without the help of a
129,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"cobbler, to shew him what and how to do each portion of his boot-making;"
130,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"but the man was frightened at having so apt a pupil, and begged pardon"
131,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,for his former neglect; for though they were not all they might have
132,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,been; they were boots.
133,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
134,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"""I see,"" said he, ""if some people neglect their work, there are sure to"
135,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"be others about who will soon leave them no business to do."""
136,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,
137,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"After this, he would sit for quite half a day at his work without going"
138,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,"round to the ""Cobbler's Arms."" Some people said it was the wax that got"
139,THE LITTLE BOOTMAKER.,on his seat that made him do it; but I do not think it was.

153,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,THE LITTLE GARDENER.
154,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
155,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
156,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,There was no nicer garden in all Surrey than Mr. Woffle's. A funny name
157,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"you'll say, but he couldn't help that. One day he came home, and after"
158,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"first kissing his three children, who were all fairly good ones--you"
159,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"know what I mean, neither better nor worse than most little children you"
160,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"and I know--said, the governess, before he went to business, had"
161,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"mentioned that they had of late attended to their lessons, and he should"
162,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"be pleased to grant them anything in reason. They all blushed,--Eva, a"
163,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"soldier's coat colour! James, a light red! and Edwin, a rose-lozenge"
164,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"hue! The fact was, they had all been saying how they should like to"
165,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,gather some flowers and have a game at playing at lady and gentleman and
166,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,gardener.
167,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
168,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,They spoke right out and told their father what was in their minds.
169,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
170,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"He said ""By all means, my dears."""
171,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
172,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,Tom became gardener. You can guess who were the others. A very
173,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"gentlemanly one he was, too. Full of nice bows and smiles. As for Eva,"
174,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"she looked quite the grown lady, and acted so well, that when she put"
175,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"her hand in her pocket for her purse, Edwin was quite surprised to find"
176,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,that only threepenny and fourpenny pieces came out of it.
177,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
178,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"""Now what sort of bouquets would your ladyship like me to cut?"" asked"
179,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"Tom, holding up a very pretty rose before his sister."
180,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
181,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"""I have consulted his lordship, here,"" answered, Eva, very grandly, ""and"
182,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"I'll have ten dozen in five minutes, like this one in my hand!"""
183,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
184,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"""I'm pleased, your ladyship,"" said Tom, respectfully, ""that you give me"
185,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"plenty of time to execute so large an order, or I might not have been"
186,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"able to have come up with them to time!"""
187,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
188,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"""Oh! great people are never in a hurry,"" quietly remarked Edwin."
189,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
190,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"Tom cut all the flowers he knew could be spared from the greenhouse, and"
191,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,her ladyship and his lordship took them and gave them to a poor girl
192,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,whose sick mother wanted some little pleasure; and the girl sold the
193,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,flowers for gentlemen's button-holes.
194,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,
195,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,"When Mr. Woffles heard all about it, he was very pleased, and kissed the"
196,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,little Woffles all round. Wasn't it a nice game for rich children to
197,THE LITTLE GARDENER.,play at; to do good to poor ones?

211,THE LITTLE COOKS.,THE LITTLE COOKS.
212,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
213,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
214,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"Everybody who knew Frank Green, liked him. He was always trying to do"
215,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"something to make those around him comfortable. His brothers, George and"
216,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"Edwin, were nice little fellows enough; but Franky, as people loved to"
217,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"call him, was the favourite. And he was generally so careful in all he"
218,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"undertook, that his parents let him do nearly everything in reason he"
219,THE LITTLE COOKS.,desired.
220,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
221,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"So, one fine morning, when his mother and father were about to start for"
222,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"the Crystal Palace, Frank, who had been sitting on his thumbs and"
223,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"thinking very deeply, jumped up all of a sudden and said, (he tried to"
224,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"speak in an off-hand manner); ""I suppose you couldn't say to a minute,"
225,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"could you, when you'll be back?"""
226,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
227,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"Father laughed, and mother turned aside her head for an instant"
228,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
229,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"""And mother's laughing, too,"" cried little Edwin. You can see him; but"
230,THE LITTLE COOKS.,I'd better introduce them.
231,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
232,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"1st--Frank: right hand, near oven."
233,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
234,THE LITTLE COOKS.,2nd--George: holding bird.
235,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
236,THE LITTLE COOKS.,3rd--Edwin: bearing tray and cover.
237,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
238,THE LITTLE COOKS.,Now we can go on.
239,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
240,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"""I know mother's laughing,"" said Edwin, ""because the back of her neck's"
241,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"red!"""
242,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
243,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"Mother kissed him, and said she'd be back at five o'clock, exactly; and"
244,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"father shook the boys by the hand, and said he'd be home at five, too."
245,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
246,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"The moment they were gone, Frank beckoned his brothers to him, and said"
247,THE LITTLE COOKS.,in whispers;
248,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
249,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"""Let's ask the cook to give us leave, and then treat mother and father"
250,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"to a jolly good dinner, and cook it ourselves!"""
251,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
252,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"George clapped his hands with delight, and Edwin danced for a moment or"
253,THE LITTLE COOKS.,two quite on his own account.
254,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
255,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"""Let's have some shrimps and marmalade,"" said he, about to run out of"
256,THE LITTLE COOKS.,the room.
257,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
258,THE LITTLE COOKS.,Frank and George laughed at him and told him he might buy some shrimps
259,THE LITTLE COOKS.,for a sauce and the marmalade would do for the pastry. They went to
260,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"work, and Frank gave his orders quite like a grand cook. He tried the"
261,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"cookery book, but, boy as he was, he threw it away in disgust. ""For,"""
262,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"said he, ""if you live in one town, you'd have to send to another to get"
263,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"all the things named in it."" They had two nice birds and a joint, and"
264,THE LITTLE COOKS.,many other things.
265,THE LITTLE COOKS.,
266,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"When their parents came home, and saw the table laid out with what the"
267,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"children had paid for out of their pocket money, they were very pleased;"
268,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"and, mind, I won't be sure; but I don't think the boys lost anything by"
269,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"their generosity. One thing I must tell, you as a secret--Edwin nearly"
270,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"shed a tear when he found he had eaten so much of the meat, which his"
271,THE LITTLE COOKS.,"money had bought, that he couldn't find room for his marmalade-tart."

285,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.
286,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
287,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
288,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,Henry Downing's father was a gamekeeper; so you will not be surprised to
289,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,hear that he was very fond of playing at hunting and shooting.
290,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
291,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,His dearest friend was little Minnie Warren. He ran up to her one fine
292,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"September day, and said, ""Oh! Minnie, father has been so kind; he has"
293,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"given me a hare, and after you and I have had a game at hunting it, I'm"
294,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"to give it to you, and you're to give it to your mother to jug. There!"
295,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"what say you to that?"""
296,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
297,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,Minnie _was_ pleased.
298,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
299,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,It was fun to see how they made believe.
300,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
301,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"Minnie tied, oh! such a long string to the hare's hind legs, and walked"
302,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"off a good way; and just as Henry cocked his gun and pretended to fire,"
303,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"she gave the string a pull, and off she ran, Henry after her."
304,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
305,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"They played at this till they were quite tired, and then our little"
306,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,friend at last made a pretence of shooting very carefully; and then
307,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,Minnie quite gravely let him come and pick Miss Hare up.
308,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
309,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"""Now,"" said Henry, ""walk home first and stand at the door with your arms"
310,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"crossed, and look quite seriously at me when I come up and give it to"
311,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"you. My gun will be in my left hand, and the hare in the other; so I"
312,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"shan't be able to take my hat off; but I'll bow twice, and make it up"
313,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"that way."""
314,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
315,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,He gave it to her; and Mrs. Warren was pleased when her daughter handed
316,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,her Henry's gift.
317,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
318,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,You may be sure he was asked to dine with them when it was cooked.
319,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
320,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"Minnie said the hare turned out tender, on purpose; and Henry added he"
321,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,believed he enjoyed the _game_.
322,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,
323,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,Mrs. Warren said it was the knocking about that made it so soft. But it
324,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"came out all right, jugged; and with the black currant jelly it was"
325,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,"really,--but there! I dare say you know what it was."

333,THE YOUNG SPORTSMAN.,So won't work like common folk;

339,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,THE LITTLE DAUBER.
340,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
341,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
342,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"Mr Frampton was a fashionable portrait painter; and, one day when he was"
343,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"out with his wife, young Richard, his son, who was quite a spoiled boy,"
344,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,fetched in some of his little acquaintances--two young gentlemen and one
345,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,lady.
346,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
347,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Now,"" said he, trying to look wise, ""Miss Fanny, just stand with"
348,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,flowers in your hand while I paint you like a grand lady; and one of you
349,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"quiz the work as it goes on, and the other pretend to be in raptures"
350,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"with the portrait."""
351,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
352,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Will you write her name under it, when it's done?"" asked Bobby Butt,"
353,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,who was always ready with his fun.
354,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
355,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""No,"" answered Richard, laughingly; ""I shall make it a speaking"
356,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"likeness."""
357,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
358,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" returned the lady; ""for I shouldn't like to be"
359,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"taken with my mouth shut."""
360,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
361,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,So they went to work.
362,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
363,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"Richard looked at the lady very sharp, particularly with his right"
364,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"eye,--you can see him; and Bob took a penny out of his pocket and held"
365,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,it in front of him as if it were an eye-glass; and Frank put his right
366,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"leg out, and bent forward and said every now and then, ""To a T!"""
367,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Charming!"" ""Nature improved!"" and other such flatteries."
368,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
369,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,It was very well to say all this; but the truth must be told: when
370,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"Richard had painted the lady's head and neck, he had no more room on the"
371,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"canvas; and what was done was so ugly, that the subject threw her"
372,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"bouquet at it. Then Richard sent it back again, at which she boxed his"
373,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,ears.
374,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
375,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""It certainly is like nothing in the world,"" said Bob, putting his hands"
376,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,before his eyes as he looked at the smudges.
377,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
378,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Of course not,"" retorted Richard; ""it's in the high school of art, and"
379,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"is not therefore meant to be natural!"""
380,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
381,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Oh! that alters the case,"" said Frank. After a bit they began to throw"
382,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"the things about, and a terrible mess and rout they made."
383,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
384,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"When they were quite tired, Richard said, ""Now I'll show you all my"
385,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"toys!"" and he was about to go out of the studio to fetch them,--"
386,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
387,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"""Stay where you are!"" cried his father, slyly entering. ""You have been"
388,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"spoiling my things, and romping where you have no business; I must set"
389,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"you a task as a punishment, and your friends must go home at once."""
390,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,
391,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,All the boys turned red enough without being painted; and Richard's
392,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"father said, quite sternly, ""Next time, before you, children, play with,"
393,THE LITTLE DAUBER.,"and destroy property, just ask yourselves how you would like your"

417,THE BUSY BEES.,"Young Dick he held his mallet high,"

426,THE BUSY BEES.,"To tell the folks these things were so,"

435,THE BUSY BEES.,"Eleven hundred sticks they cut,"

453,THE BUSY BEES.,"Or, maybe, read and then to write,"

480,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"Robert and Henry Graham were handsome, rich little fellows; but very"
481,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"fast and fond of imitating. Indeed, they were more like little men than"
482,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"young boys. And as their parents gave them plenty of pocket-money, they"
483,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"did many things that otherwise they would not have done. Added to this,"
484,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"they were spoiled by their father. You see, it's generally 'mother' who"
485,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,does this; so for a wonder we'll have a change.
486,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
487,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"Well, one day the two boys went to the family tailor, and Robert said,"
488,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"very big, ""Haw! measure us for two suits of military clothes, officers'"
489,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"ones, haw! and see that you send home with them at the same time--swords,"
490,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"muskets, canes, sentry box, tents, and all, haw! necessarythings for"
491,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"playing at soldiers!"""
492,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
493,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"Now, don't let it slip out of your mind that a bit before this, the"

495,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,soldiers.
496,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
497,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"When the clothes and other things came home, these young fellows,"
498,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"followed by the dog, which they called their army, dressed themselves,"
499,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"cleverly set up their tents, and went to work in good earnest. Billy,"
500,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"the dog, sniffed at the butt of the musket to make quite sure that it"
501,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"was not loaded. Robert put his glass to his right eye, and having posted"
502,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"Henry as a sentry, began to officer over, him, commanding him rather"
503,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,more than his brother liked.
504,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
505,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"It's not a nice thing to see a soldier cry; but if you look at Harry,"
506,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,you will find that he feels hurt very much.
507,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
508,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"""Haw! hem! sir!"" roared Robert, ""with, haw! the help of my glass I see,"
509,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"haw! a speck of rust on one of your buttons, haw! as big as the tip of a"
510,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"fly's eyelash!"""
511,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
512,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,The dog at this set up a howl. The howl called their mother's attention
513,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"to the garden, and then she saw them. With a funny smile she took all"
514,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,their toy soldiers and walked to her children.
515,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
516,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"""Haw! Pre-sent, Fire!"" cried Bob."
517,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
518,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"""Certainly,"" said his mother; and almost before they knew what she was"
519,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"about, all the soldiers were set out, just like two armies, and Mrs."
520,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"Graham called the gardener to lay a train of gunpowder, and"
521,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"called--mimicking Robert--""Present, Fire!"" and set fire to it, and there"
522,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"was heard a tremendous ""pop,"" followed by a ""puff,"" and then; no! there"
523,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,wasn't a bit of one of all those soldiers and horses left large enough
524,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,to make a match of.
525,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
526,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,The boys began to cry.
527,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,
528,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"""Now,"" said their mother, ""others, you see, can play at soldiers. What"
529,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,right had you to go to the tailor and order clothes of him! neither I
530,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,nor your father gave you permission; I have a great mind to make you go
531,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,to school in those soldiers' suits; and nice fun your play fellows would
532,THE LITTLE SOLDIERS.,"make of you!"""
