37,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,
38,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,Kate Greenaway used an early version of the rhyme to illustrate
39,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,A APPLE PIE which was first published in 1886 and it will be noticed
40,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,that there is no rhyme for the letter I.
41,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,
42,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,The rhyme of A APPLE PIE is very ancient and reference is made to it as
43,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,early as 1671 in one of the writings of John Eachard. In these early
44,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,versions the letters I and J were not differentiated. The letter J as we
45,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,know it to-day was the curved initial form of the letter I and was always
46,PUBLISHER'S NOTE,used before a vowel.
