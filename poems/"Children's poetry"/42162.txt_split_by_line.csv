97,LITTLE SIR CAT,Little Sir Cat Takes a Farewell Look at the Castle
98,LITTLE SIR CAT,
99,LITTLE SIR CAT,
100,LITTLE SIR CAT,Once upon a time I promised to tell a little boy how Little Sir Cat
101,LITTLE SIR CAT,caught the Knave of Hearts who had run away with the Queen's tarts.
102,LITTLE SIR CAT,
103,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, Sir! That Knave had run only about half way across the courtyard"
104,LITTLE SIR CAT,"when Little Sir Cat pounced on him as if he were a mouse, and his"
105,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Highness, the Knave of Hearts, stopped right then and there, but he"
106,LITTLE SIR CAT,spilt the tarts all over the ground. Wasn't that a shame?
107,LITTLE SIR CAT,
108,LITTLE SIR CAT,"This made the King dreadfully angry, and he ""beat the Knave full sore,"""
109,LITTLE SIR CAT,"as the rhyme goes in dear ""Old Mother Goose,"" and if you don't believe"
110,LITTLE SIR CAT,"me, just get the book and see for yourself. ""Now ask me a favor, and it"
111,LITTLE SIR CAT,"shall be granted,"" said the Queen who had asked Little Sir Cat to come"
112,LITTLE SIR CAT,into the castle and sit on the throne by her side.
113,LITTLE SIR CAT,
114,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Tell me where I may find my fortune,"" answered Little Sir Cat."
115,LITTLE SIR CAT,
116,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Ah!"" cried the Queen, ""that is not so easy. For each of us must make"
117,LITTLE SIR CAT,"his own fortune. But I will help you,"" and she called for her old"
118,LITTLE SIR CAT,seneschal.
119,LITTLE SIR CAT,
120,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""He will not find it on Tart Island,"" said the old retainer. ""Mayhap in"
121,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Mother Goose Island he will find it."""
122,LITTLE SIR CAT,
123,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration: LITTLE SIR CAT TAKES A FAREWELL LOOK AT THE CASTLE]
124,LITTLE SIR CAT,
125,LITTLE SIR CAT,"So pretty soon, not so very long, Little Sir Cat left the big castle,"
126,LITTLE SIR CAT,and by-and-by he came to an old willow tree by a pond. And who do you
127,LITTLE SIR CAT,"think he saw? Why, little Mrs. Oriole sitting close beside her nest that"
128,LITTLE SIR CAT,hung like a big white stocking from the branch. As soon as she saw
129,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Little Sir Cat she began to sing, and all her little birds peeped out of"
130,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the nest, but they didn't say anything, for they had never met him"
131,LITTLE SIR CAT,"before. ""Children, this is Sir Cat. I knew him when he lived in a"
132,LITTLE SIR CAT,"castle,"" said Mrs. Oriole."
133,LITTLE SIR CAT,
134,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, after that, he went in to the farmyard, for it was noontime, and"
135,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he was hungry, and knocked on the kitchen door. Just then the Cuckoo"
136,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Clock in the kitchen sounded the hour of noon, and the farmer's wife"
137,LITTLE SIR CAT,"looked out of the window to see if her man was coming through the gate,"
138,LITTLE SIR CAT,"when, of course, she spied Little Sir Cat."
139,LITTLE SIR CAT,
140,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Dinner is ready. Come in, Kitten!"" So he stepped into the neat, clean"
141,LITTLE SIR CAT,"kitchen, and as soon as the good woman had put on a clean apron, they"
142,LITTLE SIR CAT,sat down to supper. By-and-by the cuckoo came out of her little clock
143,LITTLE SIR CAT,"and said: ""Time for kittens to be in bed,"" and the twinkle, twinkle star"
144,LITTLE SIR CAT,"shone through the window, and sang a little lullaby:"
145,LITTLE SIR CAT,
146,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""_Sleep, little pussy cat, sleep."
147,LITTLE SIR CAT,The little white clouds are like sheep
148,LITTLE SIR CAT,That play all the night while the moon's shining bright.
149,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Sleep, little pussy cat, sleep._"""
150,LITTLE SIR CAT,
151,LITTLE SIR CAT,And in the next story you will find what Little Sir Cat did when he woke
152,LITTLE SIR CAT,up in the morning.

157,LITTLE SIR CAT,Little Stories of Famous Animals
158,LITTLE SIR CAT,
159,LITTLE SIR CAT,How a Dog Discovered a Hot Spring
160,LITTLE SIR CAT,
161,LITTLE SIR CAT,
162,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Tradition reports that Charles IV. discovered the Carlsbad Spring, but"
163,LITTLE SIR CAT,after you have read this little history perhaps you will agree with me
164,LITTLE SIR CAT,that if it hadn't been for his dog he never would have even seen the
165,LITTLE SIR CAT,spring.
166,LITTLE SIR CAT,
167,LITTLE SIR CAT,It happened this way: More than four hundred years ago Charles IV. was
168,LITTLE SIR CAT,hunting in the neighborhood. In the exciting chase and pursuit of a stag
169,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he suddenly lost all trace of it. As he paused, undecided which course"
170,LITTLE SIR CAT,"to take, he heard the yelping of one of his hounds, and following the"
171,LITTLE SIR CAT,"sound, he found it lying scalded in the waters of the spring, which, as"
172,LITTLE SIR CAT,"you know, is a stream of water probably escaping from a smoldering"
173,LITTLE SIR CAT,volcano way down deep in the earth. The faithful animal had followed the
174,LITTLE SIR CAT,"stag's leap into the valley, and had missed a sure footing on the rocks"
175,LITTLE SIR CAT,near by.
176,LITTLE SIR CAT,
177,LITTLE SIR CAT,"On the top of the hill, which is now called the Hirschensprung (stag's"
178,LITTLE SIR CAT,"leap), a cross has been erected, and a little lower down a lookout house"
179,LITTLE SIR CAT,"has been built. Still farther down, on a high pointed rock, a citizen of"
180,LITTLE SIR CAT,Carlsbad has had erected an iron figure of a chamois.
181,LITTLE SIR CAT,
182,LITTLE SIR CAT,"After chance had made known the hot waters of the spring to Charles IV.,"
183,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he had a bath and a hunting lodge built there, which were called after"
184,LITTLE SIR CAT,"him, Karlsbad."
185,LITTLE SIR CAT,
186,LITTLE SIR CAT,"The real discoverer of the spring, the faithful hound, has no mention"
187,LITTLE SIR CAT,"made of him by name or monument, although the crest of the hill is named"
188,LITTLE SIR CAT,for a stag and the spring after a king.

207,CHAPTER I,
208,CHAPTER I,"Tottie squeezed up close to her little sister, and Teddy shoved himself"
209,CHAPTER I,along the piazza seat until all three were packed as tight as little
210,CHAPTER I,sardines.
211,CHAPTER I,
212,CHAPTER I,"""What is it?"" asked Tottie."
213,CHAPTER I,
214,CHAPTER I,"""Hurry up and tell,"" whispered Teddy, hugging Tessie's arm, while"

221,CHAPTER I,
222,CHAPTER I,"""Oh, dear!"" sighed the three tiny T's."
223,CHAPTER I,
224,CHAPTER I,"Tessie jumped up quickly and ran inside the house, closely followed by"

226,CHAPTER I,
227,CHAPTER I,"""You can wear your roller skates,"" said mother, ""and Teddy can put on"
228,CHAPTER I,"his and go with you, if he wishes."""
229,CHAPTER I,
230,CHAPTER I,"In a few minutes the skates were strapped on each impatient little foot,"
231,CHAPTER I,and mother's darling messengers were gliding down the front walk.
232,CHAPTER I,
233,CHAPTER I,"""Be very careful not to break the eggs,"" said mother, as she stood in"
234,CHAPTER I,"the doorway watching them go out of the gate. ""Hold the bag tight and"
235,CHAPTER I,"don't go fast on the way home."""

241,CHAPTER II,
242,CHAPTER II,
243,CHAPTER II,Tessie and Teddy skated along smoothly on their errand for mother. The
244,CHAPTER II,"roller skates behaved very well, and did not try to race with each"
245,CHAPTER II,"other, so that neither little messenger had a fall, or even a bump"
246,CHAPTER II,against anybody on the sidewalk who did not get out of the way in time.
247,CHAPTER II,
248,CHAPTER II,"The fat grocer man said good morning very pleasantly, and gave them each"
249,CHAPTER II,"a little animal cracker. Tessie told him what she wanted, and while he"
250,CHAPTER II,"was counting out the eggs and putting them in the bag, she stroked his"
251,CHAPTER II,"big tiger cat, who lay half asleep on the top of the sugar barrel."
252,CHAPTER II,
253,CHAPTER II,"""Here you are, Miss,"" said the grocer man, handing the package to"
254,CHAPTER II,"Tessie, ""and be careful, little man,"" he added, turning to Teddy, ""that"
255,CHAPTER II,you don't run into sister and upset her--you won't have any eggs if you
256,CHAPTER II,"do!"""
257,CHAPTER II,
258,CHAPTER II,"""Of course not,"" replied Teddy, biting off the hind legs of his buffalo"
259,CHAPTER II,"cracker. ""I'll take care,"" and both children wabbled over the floor and"
260,CHAPTER II,through the doorway out onto the sidewalk.
261,CHAPTER II,
262,CHAPTER II,[Illustration: _Crash! There Were Scrambled Eggs All Over the Walk._]
263,CHAPTER II,
264,CHAPTER II,Everything went along beautifully. Teddy kept well behind so that
265,CHAPTER II,"Tessie would have plenty of room, and the distance was half over, when"
266,CHAPTER II,"something happened. About a block from the house, the sidewalk ran down"
267,CHAPTER II,a small hill. Although Tessie had time and again coasted down without
268,CHAPTER II,"the slightest trouble, today it seemed as if she were going very much"
269,CHAPTER II,faster than usual. Perhaps she was a little worried over the bag of
270,CHAPTER II,"eggs. At any rate, all of a sudden her feet behaved very badly, and"
271,CHAPTER II,"before she could help it, one foot went off to one side and Tessie did,"
272,CHAPTER II,too. Down she went in a heap. Crash! smash! mash! there were scrambled
273,CHAPTER II,eggs all over the walk!
274,CHAPTER II,
275,CHAPTER II,Tessie turned a frightened glance towards Teddy who just came up.
276,CHAPTER II,
277,CHAPTER II,"""O dear me! How shall I ever explain to mother?"" cried poor little"
278,CHAPTER II,Tessie.

282,CHAPTER II,
283,CHAPTER III,CHAPTER III
284,CHAPTER III,
285,CHAPTER III,
286,CHAPTER III,After Tessie and Teddy arrived home they hunted around for mother to
287,CHAPTER III,"tell her the awful news, and how sorry they were that the bag of eggs"
288,CHAPTER III,"was lying out on the sidewalk in funny yellow patches, with bits of"
289,CHAPTER III,broken shell strewn all around.
290,CHAPTER III,
291,CHAPTER III,About half an hour later Tessie was telling her little kitten what
292,CHAPTER III,"mother had said. ""And, Pussy dear,"" confided Tessie, ""don't you ever try"
293,CHAPTER III,"to carry any robin's eggs down from the nest. If you do, you'll find you"
294,CHAPTER III,"get sliding faster and faster, and before you reach the ground your foot"
295,CHAPTER III,"will slip and down you'll come with a crash!"""
296,CHAPTER III,
297,CHAPTER III,Pussy looked up out of the corners of her blinky green eyes but said
298,CHAPTER III,nothing.
299,CHAPTER III,
300,CHAPTER III,"""And maybe your mother won't be so nice about it,"" added Tessie. ""My"
301,CHAPTER III,mother didn't scold me 'cause when I 'splained how my skate nearly came
302,CHAPTER III,"off and tripped me up she just wiped my eyes, 'cause I felt awful sorry,"
303,CHAPTER III,"and told me not to cry about it any more, and by and by she gave us all"
304,CHAPTER III,"a lump of sugar."""
305,CHAPTER III,
306,CHAPTER III,[Illustration: _Tess Was Telling Her Little Kitten What Mother Had
307,CHAPTER III,Said._]
308,CHAPTER III,
309,CHAPTER III,Just then puss jumped through the low open window and skipped over the
310,CHAPTER III,lawn. Tessie stepped out on the piazza to see what she was about. At
311,CHAPTER III,the foot of the old apple tree pussy stopped and then ran up the trunk
312,CHAPTER III,and out on a limb.
313,CHAPTER III,
314,CHAPTER III,"""I do believe,"" exclaimed Tessie, ""that she is going to try to bring"
315,CHAPTER III,"down some eggs from the robin's nest."""
316,CHAPTER III,
317,CHAPTER III,"""What did my little girl say?"" asked mother, who came out on the porch"
318,CHAPTER III,"at that moment. When Tessie explained it all, mother laughed and said,"
319,CHAPTER III,"""Why, there aren't any eggs now in that nest, little girl--don't you"
320,CHAPTER III,"know all the little robins were hatched long ago?"""
321,CHAPTER III,
322,CHAPTER III,"""Well, I don't believe pussy knows it,"" answered Tessie, ""for there she"
323,CHAPTER III,"is now looking into the nest--how disappointed she'll be!"""

330,CHAPTER IV,
331,CHAPTER IV,"""Goodness me, Tottie, why don't you fasten the button!"" cried Tessie to"
332,CHAPTER IV,her little sister. But Tottie was too frightened to answer; she just
333,CHAPTER IV,stood still while sister fastened the little white pants which had
334,CHAPTER IV,slipped down on the tops of her pink slippers.
335,CHAPTER IV,
336,CHAPTER IV,"""Let's go out in the garden now,"" said Tessie, and the two little"
337,CHAPTER IV,sisters ran out on the piazza and down the walk. They found brother
338,CHAPTER IV,"Teddy already there filling his wagon with grass, for the lawn had just"
339,CHAPTER IV,been cut and was covered with the loose grass.
340,CHAPTER IV,
341,CHAPTER IV,"""We'll make a big hay mow!"" cried the children, and very soon they had"
342,CHAPTER IV,piled up the fragment grass as high as their heads. It was great fun
343,CHAPTER IV,"rolling over it, or covering each other up until nothing but a little"
344,CHAPTER IV,"toe stuck out at one end, or the tip of a little pug nose showed at the"
345,CHAPTER IV,other.
346,CHAPTER IV,
347,CHAPTER IV,"[Illustration: ""_Goodness Me, Tottie, Why Don't You Fasten the"

349,CHAPTER IV,
350,CHAPTER IV,"After a while pussy came by, but when she had been covered up deep with"
351,CHAPTER IV,"the ticklish grass, she escaped by jumping over the green haymow, and"
352,CHAPTER IV,ran off to the barn. She most likely thought it was more fun in the hay
353,CHAPTER IV,loft hunting for mice than being covered up in a big green grass hay-mow
354,CHAPTER IV,"out on the lawn. Perhaps, too, she was afraid some one might step on her"
355,CHAPTER IV,"when under the grass. At any rate, she didn't come back, and by and by"
356,CHAPTER IV,it was time for the children to go in for luncheon. I don't know whether
357,CHAPTER IV,"pussy heard the bell or not, but she came in from the barn in time to"
358,CHAPTER IV,get her saucer of milk before the children had finished.
359,CHAPTER IV,
360,CHAPTER IV,"""Pussy never has to bother with buttons,"" said Tessie, looking over at"
361,CHAPTER IV,"Tottie, and smiling."
362,CHAPTER IV,
363,CHAPTER IV,"""No,"" answered Tottie, ""'cause she has only fur."""

372,CHAPTER V,believe you are in the big ocean wading and there are lots of little
373,CHAPTER V,"silver fishes swimming all around."""
374,CHAPTER V,
375,CHAPTER V,[Illustration: _It Was Lots of Fun in the Big Round Tin Tub._]
376,CHAPTER V,
377,CHAPTER V,"After this Tottie wanted to take a bath all the time, for Mother bought"
378,CHAPTER V,some toy fishes and Tottie didn't have to make believe very hard.
379,CHAPTER V,
380,CHAPTER V,It was lots of fun in the big round tin tub. It was painted green on the
381,CHAPTER V,"outside and yellow on the inside, which looked just like the sand on the"
382,CHAPTER V,"seashore. And then, too, it had a nice wide, flat edge all around, so"
383,CHAPTER V,that it seemed almost like a beach to Tottie.
384,CHAPTER V,
385,CHAPTER V,Sometimes Mother would put a little red bathing cap on Tottie's head and
386,CHAPTER V,let her wade for a while before her bath. Tottie then kept her little
387,CHAPTER V,"shirt on, making believe it was a lovely silk bathing suit. Perhaps the"
388,CHAPTER V,little fishes thought she was a big fat giantess. At any rate they
389,CHAPTER V,slipped through her soapy little fingers as if they were swimming away
390,CHAPTER V,"for their very lives. This made Tottie laugh very much, and she would"
391,CHAPTER V,soap them well so that they would even slip through the water for quite
392,CHAPTER V,a distance when she squeezed them real hard.
393,CHAPTER V,
394,CHAPTER V,"Tottie's sister Tessie often wanted to play like her little sister, but"
395,CHAPTER V,"Mother said, ""You are too big a girl, Tessie, not to take your bath"
396,CHAPTER V,"without making a play of it."" Brother Teddy, too, wanted to get the"
397,CHAPTER V,"fishes to play with when he took his bath, but Mother said to him,"
398,CHAPTER V,"""These are Tottie's fish. You and sister Tessie are big enough to be"
399,CHAPTER V,"good while in the tub without toys,"" so Tottie was the only one in the"
400,CHAPTER V,house who made believe that the bathtub was the big ocean and her little
401,CHAPTER V,toy silver fishes real live ones!

430,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","could make up such a lovely song,"" and then he would toot across to his"

437,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
438,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",T'woo was quite provoked to think that his brother had made up such a

440,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Finally, one evening just as T'wit was about to sing his evening verse,"
441,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","T'woo opened his beak very wide, and before T'wit could commence, he"

448,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
449,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","T'wit was so surprised that he almost fell off the limb on which he sat,"

452,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Mr. and Mrs. Too-Wit, Too-Woo looked at each other as much as to say,"

458,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Where are you going, father?"" asked T'wit as they flew along silently;"
459,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",but his parent did not vouchsafe a reply until they neared the edge of
460,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","the forest. Then he turned and said, ""You two boys sit here while I fly"
461,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","over to tell my little friend some news,"" and with these words, off he"
462,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","flew straight for the Indian camp, leaving the two small owls perched on"
463,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","a limb of a tree. When he reached a tent near a big tree, he fluttered"
464,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","down to the ground, and gave a low hoot. The little Indian boy pushed"
465,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","his head out: ""What is it, Too-Wit?"" he asked."
466,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
467,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""There's a flock of wild turkeys roosting in the clump of trees by the"

471,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
472,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Little Indian hastily picked up his bow and arrows, and started off for"

474,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","so as not to frighten the wild turkeys. When he was near enough, he"
475,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","fitted a bow to his arrow, and taking careful aim, shot one of the"
476,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",birds. The flock became frightened as soon as they saw one of their
477,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","comrades fall, and taking wing, they flew off in all directions, not"
478,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","before, however, the little Indian boy had shot off his bow the second"

480,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","slightly wounded, because there was no trace of him, save a few"
481,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","feathers, when little Indian ran up to the spot where he had last seen"

483,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
484,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Picking up the bird which he had killed with his first arrow, he turned"
485,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","back to the camp. ""Thank you,"" he said to Too-Wit, as he passed the tree"

489,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Too-Wit spread his wings, and his two small sons followed after, and"
490,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","presently they were all three back at the big hollow tree, where Mrs."
491,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",Too-wit had a nice supper all ready for them.
492,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
493,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",The next afternoon Little Indian and Too-Wit went to see two funny
494,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",little Frogs who lived in the lake.
495,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
496,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Look,"" said Little Indian to Too-Wit. ""Aren't they cunning?"""
497,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
498,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Yes,"" answered the Owl; ""that's Freddie and Fannie Frog. Wait a minute"
499,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","and I'll fly over and tell them how kind you are, for the Forest Folk"
500,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","are quick to trust a friend."""
501,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
502,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",So Too-Wit flew over to where Freddie and Fannie Frog were contentedly
503,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",sitting on their lily-pad under the long grass on the edge of the lake.
504,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
505,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Hello, hullo, Too-woo!"" cried Too-Wit."
506,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
507,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Freddie jumped up so quickly that the lily-pad tilted to one side, and"
508,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",overboard went Fannie Frog with a splash.
509,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
510,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","But Fannie knew how to swim, as every well-trained Lady Frog does, and"
511,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","after shaking the water from her eyes, she scrambled back upon the"
512,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","lily-pad, none the worse for her ducking."

514,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",[Illustration]
515,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
516,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","But, dear me, I forgot to say she had lost her pretty parasol! Little"
517,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Indian saw it floating away from the spot--a pretty little lily, the"
518,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",petals of which Fannie had bent downward until they had made a very nice
519,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","umbrella top, indeed, and by holding it up by the stem, she was able to"
520,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",keep the hot sun from freckling her funny little face.
521,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
522,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Oh, where's my parasol?"" screamed Fannie. ""Oh, dear! oh, dear! there it"
523,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","is, 'way out of my reach!"""
524,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
525,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",Little Indian leaned over the bank and picked up the lily.
526,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
527,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Oh, thank you!"" said Fannie, now smiling again; ""thank you so much!"""
528,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
529,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","""Oh, that's nothing!"" answered Little Indian. ""I'm glad to be able to"

532,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
533,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Just then a breeze sprang up, and away drifted the lily-pad with Freddie"

535,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
536,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Little Indian watched them as they sailed away, for Fannie was now"
537,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","holding up for a sail the little pink parasol, which helped to pull"

539,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY",
540,"TOO-WIT, TOO-WOO AND HIS OWL FAMILY","Then Too-Wit, Too-Woo said good-by, and flew back to his home in the"

716,THE JOLLY JUNGLE FOLK,
717,THE JOLLY JUNGLE FOLK,Over Tommy Tiger's head then he thrust his trunk;

780,MASTER SPARROW'S BREAKFAST,"turn his head this way and that way, as if, so Dorothy thought, trying"

803,MASTER SPARROW'S BREAKFAST,"flew over to the crumbs and ate them up as if he had a great, big,"

1103,LITTLE SIR CAT,"As Little Sir Cat and Piggie Porker traveled on they met Sir Launcelot,"
1104,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the noble Knight of good King Arthur's round table, riding a great horse"
1105,LITTLE SIR CAT,"with Miss Muffet in the saddle. Well, by-and-by, along came old Dame"
1106,LITTLE SIR CAT,Trot with a basket of eggs on her arm. She was singing in a high cracked
1107,LITTLE SIR CAT,voice a funny song that went like this:
1108,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1109,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""_Who wants to buy some nice fresh eggs"
1110,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Laid by a hen with yellow legs,"
1111,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Yellow legs and a bright red comb,"
1112,LITTLE SIR CAT,"In a little round nest in my own dear home?_"""
1113,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1114,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""How much are they?"" asked Sir Launcelot, taking a gold piece from his"
1115,LITTLE SIR CAT,"purse. And of course, she didn't answer but handed the basket to him"
1116,LITTLE SIR CAT,"with a curtsy. ""They are yours, Sir Knight,"" and, taking the gold piece,"
1117,LITTLE SIR CAT,she wrapped it up in her handkerchief and put it away in the pocket of
1118,LITTLE SIR CAT,her short green skirt.
1119,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1120,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Sir Launcelot laughed, for he knew that a gold piece was too much to pay"
1121,LITTLE SIR CAT,"for the eggs, but he was such a generous knight he didn't care."
1122,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1123,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration: LITTLE SIR CAT VISITS MRS. PORKER]
1124,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1125,LITTLE SIR CAT,Then Piggie took Little Sir Kitten home with him to meet Mrs. Porker and
1126,LITTLE SIR CAT,the little Porkers. And after a while Little Sir Cat set out again to
1127,LITTLE SIR CAT,find his fortune.
1128,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1129,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, by-and-by, he came to a tall flag-pole at the top of which floated"
1130,LITTLE SIR CAT,a beautiful flag with red stripes and silver stars. But Little Sir Cat
1131,LITTLE SIR CAT,"didn't know what flag this was, for he had never crossed the ocean blue,"
1132,LITTLE SIR CAT,"and Mother Goose Land is not on this side of the water, you know. And"
1133,LITTLE SIR CAT,"then a big bird said, ""Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue!"" He was"
1134,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the big American Eagle, only, of course, Little Sir Cat didn't know that"
1135,LITTLE SIR CAT,"either; he only knew Mother Goose people, you see."
1136,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1137,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Why, I didn't think you could cheer so well,"" said Little Sir Cat, and"
1138,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he opened his knapsack and took out a red, white and blue lollypop and"
1139,LITTLE SIR CAT,"gave it to him, and wasn't that eagle pleased? Well, I should say he"
1140,LITTLE SIR CAT,was. He flapped his wings and began to sing:
1141,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1142,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""_Oh, I'm the bird as you all have heard"
1143,LITTLE SIR CAT,Who fights for the U. S. A.
1144,LITTLE SIR CAT,I love the stars on our beautiful flag
1145,LITTLE SIR CAT,"As I watch it wave from my lonely crag,"
1146,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And I give a screech that is heard afar,"
1147,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Three cheers for every silver star,"
1148,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And the bands of red and white and blue,"
1149,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And the soldier boys who are brave and true,"
1150,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And the sailor lads on the deep wide sea,"
1151,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Oh, the U. S. A. is the land for me!_"""
1152,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1153,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And when he finished he said to Little Sir Cat, ""Climb on my back and"
1154,LITTLE SIR CAT,"we'll fly away, far away, across the water wild with spray, way, way off"
1155,LITTLE SIR CAT,"to the U. S. A."""
1156,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1157,LITTLE SIR CAT,Isn't it wonderful how an eagle could say things like this in rhyme? It
1158,LITTLE SIR CAT,must have been because he was in Mother Goose Land where everybody talks
1159,LITTLE SIR CAT,in poetry.
1160,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1161,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""I'm afraid I can't,"" replied Little Sir Cat. ""My mother would worry if"
1162,LITTLE SIR CAT,"I went so far away."" So the big eagle said good-by, but before he left,"
1163,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he pinned a tiny red, white and blue flag on the little Kitten's coat."

1224,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"Billy Bull Frog had a deep bass voice, and every night he would sit on a"
1225,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,big flat rock amid tall sedge grass and sing. There was a little green
1226,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"lady frog that sang a beautiful soprano, but, you see, his voice was so"
1227,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,loud and strong and deep that hardly any one could hear her when she
1228,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"sang. She could hardly ever hear herself, for the louder she sang the"
1229,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"more noise Billy would make, till finally the little green lady frog"
1230,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,wouldn't sing at all.
1231,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,
1232,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"But this did not make Billy feel badly, because he loved to hear his own"
1233,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,voice so much. The little green lady frog would sit very still on her
1234,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"lily pad, and would not even look at Billy when he sang. But, oh, dear"
1235,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,me! he was so conceited about his own voice that he thought the little
1236,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,green lady frog was jealous of him.
1237,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,
1238,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"She wasn't at all, and Billy was wrong, and was acting very, very"
1239,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,foolishly. The real truth of the matter was that the little green lady
1240,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"frog had heard a tree toad singing in a tree quite close to the lake,"
1241,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"and she thought his voice very beautiful, because it was a high tenor,"
1242,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,and it sounded much better when she sang with him than it did when she
1243,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,sang with Billy Bull Frog.
1244,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,
1245,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"At first she hardly dared sing with Tommy Tree Toad, because she was"
1246,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"afraid of Billy Bull Frog, and then, too, she didn't know Tommy Tree"
1247,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,Toad very well.
1248,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,
1249,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"But after a while she became bolder and one night, when the moon was"
1250,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,shining brightly in the sky and throwing a silver path from the water
1251,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"right up to Tommy Tree Toad's tree, she climbed up the bank and stood on"
1252,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,the silver path of the moon and listened while Tommy sang his most
1253,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,beautiful song.
1254,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,
1255,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,And the longer she waited the more she wanted to go close up to the big
1256,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"tree and sing with Tommy. He kept singing in his beautiful tenor voice,"
1257,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,"""Kum-kum, kum-kum!"" and at last she hopped along the silver way up to"
1258,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,the big tree. And then they sang a lovely duet together and all the
1259,THE LITTLE GREEN LADY FROG,frogs in the lake held their breath because it was so sweet.

1269,THE PRINCESS LIL,The Princess Lil stood on the edge of the lake waiting for her

1272,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1273,THE PRINCESS LIL,"Presently she heard the honk, honk of chauffeur Billy Bullfrog's horn,"
1274,THE PRINCESS LIL,and in another moment the turtlemobile swung around the tall sedge

1281,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1282,THE PRINCESS LIL,"The princess made no reply, but sat gazing at the setting sun's"

1285,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1286,THE PRINCESS LIL,The turtlemobile glided swiftly in and out among the lily pads and
1287,THE PRINCESS LIL,hummocks of grass until it came to the open water. In the center of the
1288,THE PRINCESS LIL,"lake was a beautiful white lily. Here the turtlemobile stopped, and the"
1289,THE PRINCESS LIL,Princess Lil stepped out on the smooth green lily pad. Quickly running
1290,THE PRINCESS LIL,"across, she tripped lightly down the golden stairway inside the stem of"
1291,THE PRINCESS LIL,the beautiful white pond lily. When she reached the bottom of the golden
1292,THE PRINCESS LIL,"flight, she opened a little door, and entered her pink and white"

1294,THE PRINCESS LIL,presently a pretty little fairy appeared.
1295,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1296,THE PRINCESS LIL,"""Lorelei,"" said the princess, ""I am weary; bring me my gossamer kimono,"
1297,THE PRINCESS LIL,and do you loosen my hair. Afterwards you may coil it again and fasten
1298,THE PRINCESS LIL,"it with a single firefly, as I wish to sit out in the garden after"

1300,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1301,THE PRINCESS LIL,The moon was shining brightly as the Princess Lil ran up the golden
1302,THE PRINCESS LIL,"staircase and out upon the big flat lily pad, which was arranged like a"
1303,THE PRINCESS LIL,beautiful garden. There were small pink flowers growing in little beds
1304,THE PRINCESS LIL,"of moist earth, and winding in and out was a narrow path of tiny shiny"
1305,THE PRINCESS LIL,pebbles. Over this the princess tripped until she came to the end of the
1306,THE PRINCESS LIL,"path, where she sat down, and began to sing softly, oh, so softly, a"
1307,THE PRINCESS LIL,fairy lullaby.
1308,THE PRINCESS LIL,
1309,THE PRINCESS LIL,"""_Gently the wind of the dewy night blows,"

1444,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1445,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""All right,"" he answered, and then he went on his way, and by-and-by he"
1446,LITTLE SIR CAT,"met Little Dog Muff, who spilt his master's snuff. And, goodness me! How"
1447,LITTLE SIR CAT,"he did bark! But this didn't frighten Little Sir Cat. No, Siree. He knew"
1448,LITTLE SIR CAT,that Muff was only barking for joy. So he put out his paw and said:
1449,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1450,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Helloa, Muff. Have you spilt any snuff lately?"""
1451,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1452,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration: LITTLE SIR CAT SEES THE COW JUMP OVER THE MOON]
1453,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1454,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""No. I haven't,"" he answered. ""I don't live with my master any more. He"
1455,LITTLE SIR CAT,"wasn't a kind man; so Old Dog Tray got me a good job, and I've been a"

1457,LITTLE SIR CAT,"until he came to a Pat-a-Cake Baker Shop, outside of which stood a"
1458,LITTLE SIR CAT,little boy.
1459,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1460,LITTLE SIR CAT,"_Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,"
1461,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Baker's man,"
1462,LITTLE SIR CAT,Bake me a doughnut
1463,LITTLE SIR CAT,As fast as you can._
1464,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1465,LITTLE SIR CAT,And goodness me! that little boy stuffed a whole doughnut into his
1466,LITTLE SIR CAT,"mouth, he was in such a hurry. ""Hold on!"" cried Little Sir Cat, ""don't"
1467,LITTLE SIR CAT,"choke yourself!"" And pretty soon the Baker Man came out of his little"
1468,LITTLE SIR CAT,"shop and gave Dapple Gray a lump of sugar. ""You have a fine horse, Sir"
1469,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Cat. How much do you want for him?"""
1470,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1471,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Nothing."""
1472,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1473,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""What!"" cried the Baker Man, in astonishment."
1474,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1475,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""He's not for sale,"" said Little Sir Cat. And just then the school bell"
1476,LITTLE SIR CAT,rang and off went the little boy to his lessons.
1477,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1478,LITTLE SIR CAT,"So Little Sir Cat said ""Gid-ap!"" and rode away with Muff at his heels,"
1479,LITTLE SIR CAT,"and by-and-by they came to a thick wood. ""Don't let us go in,"" said"
1480,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Dapple Gray, ""for, there may be robbers hidden among the trees."" And"
1481,LITTLE SIR CAT,"just then a fierce-looking man ran out and, seizing Dapple Gray by the"
1482,LITTLE SIR CAT,"bridle, shouted: ""Give me your purse, or I'll make you my prisoner!"""
1483,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1484,LITTLE SIR CAT,But Dapple Gray rose on his hind legs and with his front feet knocked
1485,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the robber heels over head, and then off he went on a gallop. And after"
1486,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a while, not so very long, Little Sir Cat saw a great white bird sitting"
1487,LITTLE SIR CAT,"on a gold egg. ""Did you lay that golden egg, Mr. Big Bird?"" he asked."
1488,LITTLE SIR CAT,"But the great white bird didn't answer. Maybe she was frightened, or"
1489,LITTLE SIR CAT,"maybe she was waiting for the golden egg to hatch, for just then, all of"
1490,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a sudden, the shell broke open and out hopped twenty-one little white"
1491,LITTLE SIR CAT,"birds armed with swords. And one of them was dressed like a captain,"
1492,LITTLE SIR CAT,"with gold epaulets on his shoulder wings, and one had a drum, like a"
1493,LITTLE SIR CAT,regular little drummer boy. And then they all began to sing:
1494,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1495,LITTLE SIR CAT,"_We are the soldier birds of the air,"
1496,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And we need no aeroplane,"
1497,LITTLE SIR CAT,For we can fly across the sky

1501,LITTLE SIR CAT,
1502,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Hurrah!"" cried Little Sir Cat, and the great white mother bird flapped"

1820,TOBY'S FRIEND,"Toby was a little French bulldog. He was a very happy little animal, as"
1821,TOBY'S FRIEND,his small mistress was extremely fond of him. He had a big armchair with
1822,TOBY'S FRIEND,a fat cushion to sleep on. He also had a collar with his name and
1823,TOBY'S FRIEND,"address engraved on it, and a little license tag fastened to it. In"
1824,TOBY'S FRIEND,"winter he wore a sweater, which he found very comfortable, although not"
1825,TOBY'S FRIEND,so becoming. Toby's only regret in life was that he had no playmate. Of
1826,TOBY'S FRIEND,"course his small mistress played with him, but he could not answer her"
1827,TOBY'S FRIEND,"when she spoke to him, except by wagging his tail or by barking."
1828,TOBY'S FRIEND,
1829,TOBY'S FRIEND,"One day, while looking out of the window in the nursery he saw a little"
1830,TOBY'S FRIEND,"dog, with a tin can tied to his tail, running down the street. After him"
1831,TOBY'S FRIEND,"ran a crowd of boys. Toby barked, as he always did when he saw a dog. In"
1832,TOBY'S FRIEND,"a minute his little mistress ran up to the window. ""Oh, Toby!"" she"
1833,TOBY'S FRIEND,"cried. ""Look at the poor little dog. I'll ask mother if I can't bring"

1837,TOBY'S FRIEND,"""What is it, little girl?"""
1838,TOBY'S FRIEND,

1845,TOBY'S FRIEND,
1846,TOBY'S FRIEND,Toby's mistress sped away on her errand of mercy and in a short while
1847,TOBY'S FRIEND,James had ordered the boys off and was carrying the little dog upstairs.
1848,TOBY'S FRIEND,"He was very cunning, and Toby made a friend of him at once, but he was"
1849,TOBY'S FRIEND,very dirty and had to have a bath as soon as mother looked him over. The
1850,TOBY'S FRIEND,"decoration to his tail was removed, much to the frightened animal's"

1852,TOBY'S FRIEND,Toby was never lonely and he and Rover became great friends. Rover was

1867,THE LAZY PINK HEN,and a Pink Hen; but the Rooster was Sky Blue. They all sang a different

1869,THE LAZY PINK HEN,"the Green Hen said: ""Chick-a-chick-chee! Chick-a-chick-chee!"" But the"

1871,THE LAZY PINK HEN,

1875,THE LAZY PINK HEN,"Well, this little girl thought this would never do, and so did the"

1885,THE LAZY PINK HEN,"I don't know what they meant by it, but the Pink Hen knew, for she went"

1887,THE LAZY PINK HEN,was so tickled that he turned fourteen somersaults right off in

2121,DUCKEY DADDLES,"for there were lots of things to attend to at home. Besides, it was"
2122,DUCKEY DADDLES,"quite a long way, and she wasn't fond of walking."
2123,DUCKEY DADDLES,
2124,DUCKEY DADDLES,So one day Duckey Daddles made up his mind to go alone. Off he went on
2125,DUCKEY DADDLES,"his floppy yellow feet, wabbly, wabbly down the road, under the Old"

2136,DUCKEY DADDLES,"""Take care, there!"" said Old Uncle Bullfrog, waking up and wiping his"

2140,DUCKEY DADDLES,"""What's the use of going home for lunch? I've had mine already!"" he"

2286,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2287,LITTLE SIR CAT,After leaving Cinderella's house Little Sir Cat continued his journey
2288,LITTLE SIR CAT,"with a happy heart, for had he not had a fine night's rest and a good"
2289,LITTLE SIR CAT,"breakfast, and for a traveler that is a good beginning. The road now led"
2290,LITTLE SIR CAT,"through the country, with well-kept farm lands on either side."
2291,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2292,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""That looks like the House That Jack Built!"" he exclaimed, as he neared"
2293,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a big farm house. Sure enough it was, for there in the meadow close by"
2294,LITTLE SIR CAT,"was the Cow With the Crumpled Horn, and leaning against the turnstile at"
2295,LITTLE SIR CAT,the corner of the fence was the Maiden All Forlorn.
2296,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2297,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Good morning, Miss,"" said Little Sir Cat, but for an answer the maiden"
2298,LITTLE SIR CAT,began to cry.
2299,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2300,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Don't cry,"" he said, wiping the tears from her eyes, for he was a very"
2301,LITTLE SIR CAT,"tender-hearted puss. ""Don't cry."""
2302,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2303,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""I can't help it,"" whimpered the Maiden All Forlorn. ""You'd cry, too, if"

2305,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2306,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Did it tickle?"" inquired Little Sir Cat."

2314,LITTLE SIR CAT,Piggie Porker began to cry. I guess he felt that nobody cared much about

2316,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2317,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""_Nobody, nobody cares for me,"

2323,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2324,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""You naughty pig,"" said the Maiden All Forlorn, ""how did you get out of"

2326,LITTLE SIR CAT,"run-away. Well, after that she invited Little Sir Cat to visit the House"
2327,LITTLE SIR CAT,"that Jack Built, which was just a little ways off on the green hill. So"
2328,LITTLE SIR CAT,the three went through the stile and by-and-by they found Jack himself
2329,LITTLE SIR CAT,"making a garage in which to keep his new automobile, for in Mother Goose"
2330,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Land, now-a-days, automobiles are quite the thing, you know."
2331,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2332,LITTLE SIR CAT,"But, oh, dear me! As soon as the Dog that Worried the Cat saw Little Sir"

2334,LITTLE SIR CAT,"his tail, asked about Old Mother Hubbard's dog. After that all the"
2335,LITTLE SIR CAT,"people who lived in the House that Jack Built came out to say ""How do"

2368,LITTLE SIR CAT,How Mister Breeze Saved Marjorie's Easter Lily
2369,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2370,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2371,LITTLE SIR CAT,It was Easter morning and the happy bells from belfry and steeple were
2372,LITTLE SIR CAT,ringing out the glad Easter tidings. Sunday School was just over and
2373,LITTLE SIR CAT,Marjorie walked through the Park on her way home. In her arms she
2374,LITTLE SIR CAT,"carried a large pot of lilies and a little fluffy yellow chick,--a tiny"
2375,LITTLE SIR CAT,"fuzzy yellow chicken,--which she had received from the Sunday School for"
2376,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Easter. The flower pot was rather heavy, and after a while, Marjorie"
2377,LITTLE SIR CAT,"became tired, so she sat down on a bench to rest. Crossing one little"
2378,LITTLE SIR CAT,"fat leg over the other she carefully balanced the lily on her knee, and"
2379,LITTLE SIR CAT,tucked the small chicken under her arm for safe keeping. It was quite
2380,LITTLE SIR CAT,"windy, and the ribbons on her hat stretched out behind like the tail of"
2381,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a kite, but Marjorie didn't care nearly as much about her pretty Easter"
2382,LITTLE SIR CAT,hat being blown off her head as she did about the lilies being broken by
2383,LITTLE SIR CAT,the mischievous breeze. It made so much noise rustling the dried leaves
2384,LITTLE SIR CAT,"and branches, that she didn't hear a big white bunny creep up softly"
2385,LITTLE SIR CAT,"behind the bench. He looked cautiously around with his bright pink eyes,"
2386,LITTLE SIR CAT,"but there was nobody near. The big policeman, who had passed but a"
2387,LITTLE SIR CAT,"moment before with a smile and a nod to Marjorie, was far down the"
2388,LITTLE SIR CAT,path. The nurse in gray uniform with the pink and white baby in the
2389,LITTLE SIR CAT,"smart English carriage, had disappeared in the distance, and, best of"
2390,LITTLE SIR CAT,"all, Marjorie's face was turned the other way. So up jumped Mr. White"
2391,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Bunny on the back of the bench, and creeping along the narrow top rail,"
2392,LITTLE SIR CAT,commenced very softly to nibble the beautiful green leaves of the Easter
2393,LITTLE SIR CAT,Lily.
2394,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2395,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration]
2396,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2397,LITTLE SIR CAT,"The little yellow chicken saw him, but he didn't say a word to Marjorie;"
2398,LITTLE SIR CAT,he just snuggled up under her arm.
2399,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2400,LITTLE SIR CAT,Perhaps the bunny looked as big as a polar bear to the fuzzy yellow
2401,LITTLE SIR CAT,"chicken. At any rate, the little chicken never peeped! He wasn't going"
2402,LITTLE SIR CAT,to take any chances with a big animal like that!
2403,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2404,LITTLE SIR CAT,A sparrow close by tried his best to tell Marjorie that her lovely lily
2405,LITTLE SIR CAT,"was being devoured, but she only laughed when he fluttered his wings and"
2406,LITTLE SIR CAT,twittered.
2407,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2408,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Isn't he pretty?"" she thought. ""He's a funny little fellow,"" and she"
2409,LITTLE SIR CAT,"watched him hop about, not understanding that he was trying his best to"
2410,LITTLE SIR CAT,save her Easter flower.
2411,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2412,LITTLE SIR CAT,Even the mischievous breeze began to feel sorry for the little girl and
2413,LITTLE SIR CAT,"tried to blow away the leaves from the bunny's mouth, but Mr. Bunny"
2414,LITTLE SIR CAT,crept up closer and quietly kept on nibbling. This was too much for the
2415,LITTLE SIR CAT,"mischievous little breeze. He gave another hard puff, almost overturning"
2416,LITTLE SIR CAT,the flower pot.
2417,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2418,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Marjorie gave a little scream when she saw what Mr. Bunny had done, and"
2419,LITTLE SIR CAT,then of course he scampered away.
2420,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2421,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""You naughty little rabbit,"" she cried, lifting up the half-eaten leaf,"
2422,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""just see what you've done to my lily."""
2423,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2424,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""If you had paid attention to me it wouldn't have happened,"" twittered"
2425,LITTLE SIR CAT,the little sparrow. But of course Marjorie didn't understand him.
2426,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2427,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""I saved the lily for you,"" whispered the mischievous breeze, as she"
2428,LITTLE SIR CAT,"started for home. And I think she understood him, for she laughed as she"
2429,LITTLE SIR CAT,"pushed back her curls, as much as to say, ""You needn't muss my hair all"
2430,LITTLE SIR CAT,"up telling me so, Mr. Breeze!"""

2510,A JOKE ON UNCLE JIMMY,
2511,A JOKE ON UNCLE JIMMY,"""Come on, May,"" he cried excitedly, ""I see Uncle Jimmy coming!"" Both"

2565,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2566,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Where is the naughty boy who put her in?"" asked Little Sir Cat. But"
2567,LITTLE SIR CAT,"nobody knew. I guess he had run away, as bad boys generally do after"
2568,LITTLE SIR CAT,they have done something they know is wrong.
2569,LITTLE SIR CAT,

2585,LITTLE SIR CAT,"one big captain said, ""Three cheers and two tigers for Little Sir Cat!"""
2586,LITTLE SIR CAT,
2587,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And, goodness me, the cheers that went up from that regiment were heard"

2605,LITTLE SIR CAT,"couldn't be heard at all, although Little Sir Cat beat on it with all"

2607,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the field where they had been fighting looked like a tented city, only"
2608,LITTLE SIR CAT,it didn't have any little church or school house.

2868,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,large W and X made a pair of funny legs.

2870,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2871,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2872,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""I wonder who he is?"" thought Jamie."
2873,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2874,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""I'm the Lion Tamer,"" answered the man, as if reading the little boy's"
2875,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,thoughts.
2876,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2877,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""Are you?"" said Jamie. ""I saw your lion the first thing--just as I came"
2878,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"into the tent. Aren't you afraid you'll lose him?"""
2879,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2880,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2881,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2882,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""I'm more afraid he'll lose me,"" replied the Lion Tamer. He was quite"
2883,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"right, for at that instant the Alphabet Letters fell apart and a pretty"
2884,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,girl stood in his place.
2885,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2886,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2887,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2888,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""I'm the Circus Queen, little Jamie,"" she said with a smile, and then"
2889,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"she gave him an alphabet kiss, which looked just like the letter O, I"
2890,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,guess. And then the Letters tumbled apart and the Circus Queen
2891,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,disappeared.
2892,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2893,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2894,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2895,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"But they were not idle, these wonderful Alphabet Letters. They ran ahead"
2896,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"for a little way and then, all of a sudden, arranged themselves into a"
2897,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"beautiful white cow, which looked to Jamie very much like the one in Mr."

2899,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2900,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2901,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2902,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""Where's Mother?"" cried a loud voice, and Jamie saw a small elephant"
2903,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"looking anxiously about. A big J made a most beautiful trunk, while a"
2904,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"capital M served for two sturdy legs. An S made a nice tail, and the"
2905,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,other letters finished his body very satisfactorily.
2906,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2907,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"""You'd better hurry,"" advised Jamie, ""or the first thing you know the"
2908,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"Letters will get tired of making you an elephant, and turn into some"
2909,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"other sort of animal."""
2910,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2911,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,[Illustration]
2912,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2913,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"And Jamie was right, for the next instant there was no little elephant,"
2914,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"but instead, a quiet looking camel, with two big humps."
2915,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,
2916,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"In a few minutes, the camel, too, disappeared, and the wonderful"
2917,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"Alphabet Letters ran over to the other side of the tent, and the next"
2918,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,thing Jamie saw was a funny little man whose make-up consisted of only a
2919,THE ALPHABET ANIMAL CIRCUS,"few big letters, but who nevertheless seemed a very important person."

3039,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3040,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3041,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,It was the night before Christmas. Outside a cold wind blew the snow
3042,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"about in clouds, penetrating the cracks and chinks of the little old"
3043,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"white house on the hill. Before the small fire of driftwood, which tried"
3044,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"its best to warm the little bare room, sat Mrs. Whitcomb, wondering"
3045,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,sadly where the money was to come from to buy the turkey for the dinner
3046,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,the next day.
3047,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3048,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Mrs. Whitcomb's eyes filled with tears as she remembered the happy
3049,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Christmas of a few years previous, when the children's father was alive."
3050,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Just then an excited ejaculation from Madge in the doorway startled her.
3051,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3052,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Mother, dear!"" she cried, running in, followed by Billy, ""I've just"
3053,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,been thinking of that story you read to us last year about the money
3054,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,that was stored away behind the old family portrait over the
3055,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"mantelpiece. Don't you remember how it fell down when the little boy,"
3056,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"who was locked in the closet for being naughty, kicked the closet door"
3057,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"till everything shook and shook; and then down fell the portrait, and"
3058,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"the bags of money just emptied themselves all over the floor?"""
3059,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3060,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""I'll be the bad boy if you want to put me in the closet,"" offered"
3061,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Billy. Mrs. Whitcomb looked up with a sad smile, as she took Madge in"
3062,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,her lap and placed an arm around him.
3063,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3064,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Suppose we make believe the old mirror is a portrait,"" she said."
3065,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3066,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""And I'll make believe I'm naughty,"" added Billy. ""It will be the first"
3067,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"time I've ever had to make believe!"""
3068,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3069,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Madge jumped off her lap and ran to the closet. ""Come, mother,"" she"
3070,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"called, ""make Billy go inside!"" In a moment he was shut in, and even"
3071,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Mrs. Whitcomb began to laugh, for Billy's acting was almost as real as"
3072,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,if he had indeed been a bad boy and was undergoing a just punishment.
3073,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"One of the candlesticks tumbled over on top of the tiny mahogany box,"
3074,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"knocking it off upon the floor. It broke open on the hearthstone, and as"
3075,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Mrs. Whitcomb stooped to pick up the broken pieces she uttered a cry of
3076,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,joy.
3077,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3078,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Come here!"" she called, ""come, see what I've found,"" and she held up a"
3079,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,five-dollar gold piece before Madge's delighted eyes.
3080,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3081,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Oh, mother, darling!"" screamed Madge, ""where did it come from?"""
3082,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3083,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""What's the matter? Let me out!"" yelled Billy from the depths of the"
3084,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"closet; ""let me out! What's the matter?"""
3085,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3086,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"Madge rushed over to the closet, but in her excitement found it"
3087,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,difficult to turn the key.
3088,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3089,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""What's it all about?"" cried Billy."
3090,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3091,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Oh, Billy,"" gasped Madge, as she twisted and turned the handle, ""what"
3092,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"do you think? Mother has found a five-dollar gold piece!"""
3093,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3094,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Goodness me!"" exclaimed Mrs. Whitcomb, after the noise and excitement"
3095,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"had subsided, ""how in the world I ever forgot that I put that money away"
3096,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"for safe keeping in that little box years ago is beyond me. But I did,"
3097,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"and it isn't a dream!"""
3098,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3099,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""No, indeed, mother!"" cried Madge, pinching the gold piece, ""it's as"
3100,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"real as can be!"""
3101,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3102,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Let's all go down to the village and get the dinner things,"" suggested"
3103,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,Billy.
3104,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3105,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"By the time the celery and vegetables, the nuts and raisins, together"
3106,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"with the big, fat turkey, were safely packed, the basket was fairly"
3107,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,bulging over.
3108,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3109,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Oh, what a feast we'll have tomorrow,"" gasped Madge. They set the heavy"
3110,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"basket down before the mantel-piece, as mother closed the outer door and"
3111,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"came in. ""What a jolly dinner! I'm so glad Billy and I got to talking"
3112,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"before going to bed. Wasn't it lucky I remembered that story?"""
3113,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3114,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Yes, indeed,"" answered mother, smiling away, as she unpacked the basket"
3115,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,and stowed away all the good things in safe places until the next day.
3116,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3117,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Just like a play,"" volunteered Billy, ""with me as the hero!"""
3118,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3119,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""With Madge as the author,"" said mother."
3120,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,
3121,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"""Right you are, mother dear,"" answered Billy, ""only without the great"
3122,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,acting on the hero's part there would never have been any success to the
3123,THE LITTLE WHITE HOUSE ON THE HILL,"play. That closet wasn't such a joke after all!"""

3217,FRIENDS OF OURS,When did human beings first begin to love dogs? So long ago that we have
3218,FRIENDS OF OURS,"forgotten just when it all started, but some of the oldest writers and"
3219,FRIENDS OF OURS,artists whose works have been preserved up to the present time have left
3220,FRIENDS OF OURS,us words or pictures which show that the dog is a very ancient friend of
3221,FRIENDS OF OURS,man.
3222,FRIENDS OF OURS,
3223,FRIENDS OF OURS,"Little Egyptian boys and girls, playing on the banks of the Nile,"
3224,FRIENDS OF OURS,probably loved their dogs as well as Brooklyn children love theirs. In
3225,FRIENDS OF OURS,"that old country the dog was particularly well liked, and it is said"
3226,FRIENDS OF OURS,that when a family dog died all the people of the household shaved
3227,FRIENDS OF OURS,"themselves. This was an expression of mourning, and was a mark of"
3228,FRIENDS OF OURS,respect for the dog.
3229,FRIENDS OF OURS,
3230,FRIENDS OF OURS,Egyptians had a special reason for honoring the animal which has always
3231,FRIENDS OF OURS,been used as a symbol of faithfulness. In lower Egypt the prosperity of
3232,FRIENDS OF OURS,the people depended upon the Nile River. Every year it overflowed its
3233,FRIENDS OF OURS,"banks, giving the dry land a much needed drink and making possible the"
3234,FRIENDS OF OURS,raising of different crops. The people watched for the overflow with
3235,FRIENDS OF OURS,"great anxiety, fearing that it would not take place. At the time of year"
3236,FRIENDS OF OURS,"when the overflow was due a certain star appeared in the sky, which we"
3237,FRIENDS OF OURS,know as Sirius. When they saw that the Egyptians drove their cattle to
3238,FRIENDS OF OURS,high pastures and left the lowland to be watered by the river. In time
3239,FRIENDS OF OURS,the people began to associate the constant appearance of the star with
3240,FRIENDS OF OURS,"the overflow which meant so much to them, and they began to think that"
3241,FRIENDS OF OURS,"the star watched over them, as a good dog watches the home of its"
3242,FRIENDS OF OURS,"master. So they called the star the ""Dog Star"" and worshipped it, and"
3243,FRIENDS OF OURS,also lavished a great deal of love on all.

3253,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"It is said that Nero, when he was Emperor of Rome, set fire to the city,"
3254,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"and watched the flames from a high tower, while he sang to his lyre"
3255,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"verses on the burning of Troy. He then laid the blame on the Christians,"
3256,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,whom he persecuted with great cruelty. Afterwards he rebuilt the ruined
3257,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"portion of Rome with great magnificence, erecting a beautiful palace for"
3258,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"himself on the Palatine Hill, which was called Nero's golden house."
3259,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
3260,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"This was all very long ago, for he killed himself with a dagger in the"
3261,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"year 68 when, after many cruel deeds, the Senate condemned him to death."
3262,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
3263,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"In 1871 there lived in Chicago, Illinois, a woman named Annie O'Leary"
3264,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,who has since become known throughout the country as the owner of the
3265,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"cow that set fire to Chicago. One evening this cow, while being milked,"
3266,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"became unruly, and kicked over a kerosene lamp. Soon the whole city of"
3267,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,Chicago was in flames and Mrs. O'Leary's cow probably rang her cowbell
3268,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,quite as frantically as did the Emperor Nero complacently fiddle while
3269,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,his beautiful city was burning.
3270,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
3271,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,Though Chicago was destroyed by one of the most terrible fires in the
3272,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"world, the city was rebuilt in a year or two, even better than before."
3273,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"Prior to the fire, it was one of the newest cities in the country, for"
3274,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,in 1830 there were only a few families there besides the soldiers in the
3275,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,fort which Uncle Sam had built in 1804.
3276,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,

3353,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""_Mistress Mary, quite contrary,"
3354,LITTLE SIR CAT,"How does your garden grow?"""
3355,LITTLE SIR CAT,Sang Little Sir Cat
3356,LITTLE SIR CAT,As he doffed his hat
3357,LITTLE SIR CAT,To the cockle-shells all in a row._
3358,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3359,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3360,LITTLE SIR CAT,"It was a lovely garden, full of flowers and shrubs, and in one corner"
3361,LITTLE SIR CAT,was a little girl playing with pretty shells on a pile of sand.
3362,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3363,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Come in and play with me,"" she said. So he jumped over the garden wall,"
3364,LITTLE SIR CAT,"but he didn't stay very long, for he wished to find his fortune, you"
3365,LITTLE SIR CAT,know.
3366,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3367,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, after a while, as he journeyed on he came to a bridge, and, all of"
3368,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a sudden, whom should he meet but Sir Launcelot of the Lake, that noble"
3369,LITTLE SIR CAT,knight whom you remember he had met a long time ago. And when Sir
3370,LITTLE SIR CAT,Launcelot had reined in his great charger he cried out in a loud voice:
3371,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3372,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration: LITTLE SIR CAT AND MARY IN THE GARDEN]
3373,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3374,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Come with me, Kitten!"" So Little Sir Cat sprang up lightly behind the"
3375,LITTLE SIR CAT,noble knight and together they rode across the bridge and out upon the
3376,LITTLE SIR CAT,"King's Highway. And after they had gone for many miles, they came"
3377,LITTLE SIR CAT,across Little Miss Muffet who sat on a tuffet. But this time she wasn't
3378,LITTLE SIR CAT,running away from the big cruel spider who had sat down beside her.
3379,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3380,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Whither are you bound, little maid?"" asked the knight. And then without"
3381,LITTLE SIR CAT,waiting for an answer he leaned over and lifted her up into the saddle
3382,LITTLE SIR CAT,beside Little Sir Kitten. And wasn't she glad to see our little traveler
3383,LITTLE SIR CAT,"again? Well, if you had only been there you would have laughed with joy,"
3384,LITTLE SIR CAT,for she was so happy that she hugged him again and again.
3385,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3386,LITTLE SIR CAT,"After a while they came to an old mill where the rusty, dusty miller"
3387,LITTLE SIR CAT,"ground the corn for the farmers. ""Please let me down here,"" said little"
3388,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Miss Muffet, ""for mother asked me to bring home some meal."" So the kind"
3389,LITTLE SIR CAT,knight pulled in his great steed and Little Miss Muffet ran into the
3390,LITTLE SIR CAT,mill.
3391,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3392,LITTLE SIR CAT,"But Sir Launcelot didn't wait, for he wasn't going back, you see, so he"
3393,LITTLE SIR CAT,and Little Sir Cat called out good-by and went upon their way. And the
3394,LITTLE SIR CAT,sun shone down and glittered on the bright armor of the noble knight and
3395,LITTLE SIR CAT,pussy cat felt very proud to be riding with him.
3396,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3397,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""You shall go with me to King Arthur's Court,"" said Sir Launcelot, ""for"
3398,LITTLE SIR CAT,little friend Tom Thumb is with my good king and he has told all the
3399,LITTLE SIR CAT,"knights what a good comrade you are."""
3400,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3401,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Towards evening, they came to the Court of King Arthur where all the"
3402,LITTLE SIR CAT,knights were eating their evening meal at the great round table. But
3403,LITTLE SIR CAT,"when they heard the hoof beats of Sir Launcelot's great horse, they ran"
3404,LITTLE SIR CAT,outside to greet him. Little Sir Kitten was taken into the great dining
3405,LITTLE SIR CAT,hall and placed on the right hand of King Arthur and merry was the
3406,LITTLE SIR CAT,"feast that followed, for they had all heard of brave Little Sir Cat and"

3420,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3421,LILY'S CIRCUS,Captain Morton was an officer in the United States Army and for many
3422,LILY'S CIRCUS,years had lived in the far west--that wonderful country where the sun
3423,LILY'S CIRCUS,"blazes down upon miles of grassy prairie, undulating to the horizon as"
3424,LILY'S CIRCUS,"if it were a great heaving sea, the little hillocks rising like dark"
3425,LILY'S CIRCUS,waves upon its surface.
3426,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3427,LILY'S CIRCUS,"Over those vast plains roved the Indians, hunting antelopes, wolves,"
3428,LILY'S CIRCUS,"etc. At these times the ""red man"" looks his best; mounted on his swift"
3429,LILY'S CIRCUS,"pony, his gaudy blanket and bright feathers gleaming in the sunshine,"
3430,LILY'S CIRCUS,"his long black hair streaming in the wind, he seems truly the ""noble"
3431,LILY'S CIRCUS,"savage."""
3432,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3433,LILY'S CIRCUS,"To control these savages, soldiers were needed on the plains, to prevent"
3434,LILY'S CIRCUS,"war parties from dashing into little frontier villages, stealing horses"
3435,LILY'S CIRCUS,"and cattle, burning barns and houses and murdering the people who were"
3436,LILY'S CIRCUS,"trying to cultivate the prairies, to turn the great plains of dry, burnt"
3437,LILY'S CIRCUS,grass into fields of wheat and beautiful green meadows.
3438,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3439,LILY'S CIRCUS,All Indians are not wicked; but the tribe near which Captain Morton was
3440,LILY'S CIRCUS,"stationed was extremely wild and cruel, and refused to live on friendly"
3441,LILY'S CIRCUS,terms with white people.
3442,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3443,LILY'S CIRCUS,"All day and all night the ""tom-tom,"" or big drum, was being beaten by"
3444,LILY'S CIRCUS,the Indians; for the time I am telling you of was just after that
3445,LILY'S CIRCUS,"dreadful battle, when the great Indian chief, Sitting Bull, killed brave"
3446,LILY'S CIRCUS,General Custer and half of his noble regiment of cavalry. This success
3447,LILY'S CIRCUS,"had made all the other Indians very fierce and restless, and the small"
3448,LILY'S CIRCUS,garrison of which Captain Morton had command were kept busy day and
3449,LILY'S CIRCUS,night ready for attack.
3450,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3451,LILY'S CIRCUS,"But Lily, Captain Morton's little daughter, did not trouble herself"
3452,LILY'S CIRCUS,"about danger. She was not allowed to go out of the garrison inclosure,"
3453,LILY'S CIRCUS,"but she played with her chickens and her little pony, which her father"
3454,LILY'S CIRCUS,"had bought and trained for her. Its name was Tecumseh Sherman, after the"
3455,LILY'S CIRCUS,"general of the army, but Lily called it Tic for short. It soon followed"
3456,LILY'S CIRCUS,"her in and out of the log house and wherever she went, and showed a most"
3457,LILY'S CIRCUS,"decided liking for anything of a red color. When Lily wore a red dress,"
3458,LILY'S CIRCUS,"Tic would take a fold in his mouth and pull her about, and even knock"
3459,LILY'S CIRCUS,"her down in his play, for he never meant to hurt her. In the evening"
3460,LILY'S CIRCUS,"Lily's little sidesaddle was put on Tic, and she would gallop over the"
3461,LILY'S CIRCUS,prairie with her father.
3462,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3463,LILY'S CIRCUS,One morning Lily rushed into the house calling out:

3465,LILY'S CIRCUS,"""Mama, mama, here's a circus! Come and see! It's right outside the"
3466,LILY'S CIRCUS,"door!"""
3467,LILY'S CIRCUS,
3468,LILY'S CIRCUS,"Sure enough, just outside the garrison was a great crowd of gayly"
3469,LILY'S CIRCUS,"dressed people, and near the front were six girls mounted on ponies, the"
3470,LILY'S CIRCUS,"saddles beautifully embroidered with beads, and fine large umbrellas"
3471,LILY'S CIRCUS,"over their heads made of red, white and blue cloth. These were"

3553,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"black-eyed bundle tied upon her back, and stood for several minutes"
3554,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,absorbed in contemplation.
3555,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,
3556,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"""Is that a real, live baby, ma'am, or a doll you keep for your little"

3559,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"The squaw, of course, did not understand a word she said, and only"
3560,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"responded: ""Ugh! Howe! Washta papoose!"" as a general expression of her"

3563,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,
3564,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,What a scream! Even the dignified chiefs turned their plumed heads to

3566,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,
3567,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"There was the papoose shrieking on its mother's back, proving most"
3568,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"positively its claim to be considered a ""real, live baby,"" and there was"
3569,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,a drop of bright red blood on its little brown arm. Lily had stuck a pin
3570,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,in the Indian baby to find out if it was alive or not.
3571,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,
3572,LILY AND THE PAPOOSE,"Poor little girl! She stood frightened and trembling, crimson blushes on"

3714,EASTER ON A FARM,invite their two cousins to an Easter Egg Hunt.
3715,EASTER ON A FARM,
3716,EASTER ON A FARM,Their mother had agreed to give them one egg out of every six which they
3717,EASTER ON A FARM,"brought in to Mary, their good-natured cook, and it was surprising how"
3718,EASTER ON A FARM,many egg nests these industrious little folks discovered in
3719,EASTER ON A FARM,out-of-the-way places around the big barn and the farm buildings.
3720,EASTER ON A FARM,
3721,EASTER ON A FARM,In fact the family had never been so plentifully supplied with eggs
3722,EASTER ON A FARM,"before, and their mother laughingly remarked that she thought it would"
3723,EASTER ON A FARM,"be a good plan to continue the arrangement indefinitely, to which the"
3724,EASTER ON A FARM,children gave their hearty consent.
3725,EASTER ON A FARM,
3726,EASTER ON A FARM,The day before Easter they had almost two dozen. With the help of their
3727,EASTER ON A FARM,mother they dissolved the various colored powders which they had
3728,EASTER ON A FARM,purchased at the drug store and poured the liquid into several tins. It
3729,EASTER ON A FARM,"was great fun boiling the eggs in green water, or yellow water, or blue"

3738,EASTER ON A FARM,
3739,EASTER ON A FARM,"""Well, let's hide them; you hide yours first, Ruth, 'cause you're the"

3742,EASTER ON A FARM,
3743,EASTER ON A FARM,"You see, the game was for each one to hide his share, and when all the"

3748,EASTER ON A FARM,
3749,EASTER ON A FARM,It took little Ruth quite a while to hide hers. She put a big red egg
3750,EASTER ON A FARM,carefully in the oat bin and covered it over with oats. The next one she
3751,EASTER ON A FARM,"put deep down in the bran bin, and then she looked around for another"
3752,EASTER ON A FARM,safe place. There was father's old coat hanging on a nail by the harness
3753,EASTER ON A FARM,room. In the pocket nearest her she slipped a green egg carefully lest
3754,EASTER ON A FARM,"it fall through a possible hole in the well-worn garment, but the lining"
3755,EASTER ON A FARM,was sound and the egg was safe out of sight.
3756,EASTER ON A FARM,
3757,EASTER ON A FARM,The door of the harness room was ajar. Ruth stepped inside and looked
3758,EASTER ON A FARM,around. The very thing! An old tin can stood half-hidden in the corner
3759,EASTER ON A FARM,"behind a pile of rubbish. In went the purple egg, and now she had only"
3760,EASTER ON A FARM,two left.
3761,EASTER ON A FARM,
3762,EASTER ON A FARM,"""What shall I do?"" said Ruth to herself. Just then an old lantern"
3763,EASTER ON A FARM,"hanging on the wall met her eyes, and in a moment she had carefully"
3764,EASTER ON A FARM,lifted the dingy shade and placed an egg inside. Only one egg was now
3765,EASTER ON A FARM,"left, and soon that was tucked away behind an old picture advertising"
3766,EASTER ON A FARM,"harness, which rested on a beam running along the side of the wall."
3767,EASTER ON A FARM,
3768,EASTER ON A FARM,"""No one must hunt for his own eggs,"" said Donald. ""Then it will be fair"

3770,EASTER ON A FARM,
3771,EASTER ON A FARM,"The two cousins had been told that the barn, the wagon house and the"
3772,EASTER ON A FARM,"orchard were the places where the eggs were hidden, and in a few minutes"
3773,EASTER ON A FARM,a yell was heard in the barn. Dan had discovered Ruth's green egg in the
3774,EASTER ON A FARM,overcoat pocket.
3775,EASTER ON A FARM,
3776,EASTER ON A FARM,"""I've got one!"" screamed Ruth from the wagon house, as she pulled out a"

3780,EASTER ON A FARM,
3781,EASTER ON A FARM,"""Who'll get the last one?"" Here and there they ran, looking with the"

3784,EASTER ON A FARM,"marching up to a big cherry tree, from a crotch of a limb just above"

3796,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,Everybody loves Robin Redbreast. Who of us in early spring is not
3797,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,gladdened by the sight of this red waistcoated little chap hopping about
3798,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,on the lawn? But few of us stop to think that our robin is totally
3799,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"unlike the English robin, the dear old Robin Redbreast of nursery days;"
3800,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,he who covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood and was shot by the
3801,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,Sparrow with his little arrow!
3802,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3803,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"The Redbreast of Europe is only half the size of our robin, being about"
3804,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,five inches and three-quarters from the tip of its bill to the end of
3805,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,its tail feathers. Its color is a yellowish olive-brown. The throat and
3806,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"breast are of a reddish orange color, and this gives to him the name of"
3807,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,Redbreast.
3808,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3809,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"They remain all the year round, and when the fields and gardens are"
3810,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"covered with snow, making it difficult for them to obtain food they come"
3811,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"up to the door steps, picking up the crumbs which are thrown to them."
3812,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,When they are well treated they soon become very familiar and make
3813,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"themselves quite at home, entering the cottage door and often roosting"
3814,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,confidently over night in the warm kitchens. Their trust and confidence
3815,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,have made friends for them everywhere and they become domestic pets in
3816,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,almost every country in Europe. Their song is sweet and plaintive and
3817,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,is heard from early spring until late in the autumn. In this respect
3818,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,they are very like our own bluebird.
3819,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3820,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,English books of natural history are full of interesting narratives of
3821,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,the beautiful confidence in man shown by the Redbreast in selecting a
3822,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,place for its nest.
3823,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3824,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,Our pair chose for their nest a shelf in a schoolroom in which there
3825,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,were seventy children and directly over the heads of a little class of
3826,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"girls, who never once disturbed them. One of the little birds died and"
3827,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,the parents carried out its dead body during school hours. The other
3828,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"four little robins were fed and reared, day by day, in the presence of"
3829,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,the seventy children. Do you wonder that the boys and girls of England
3830,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,are so fond of their Robin Redbreast?
3831,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3832,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,The robin of North America belongs to a very different family--that of
3833,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,the thrushes. It is nearly twice the length of the English bird and more
3834,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"than twice its size. Audubon calls it the Migratory Thrush, because it"
3835,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,leaves us when winter comes on and does not return until the frost is
3836,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,out of the ground.
3837,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3838,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"Like the robin of Europe, our bird also has a confiding disposition. It"
3839,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"builds its nest early in the spring, long before there are any leaves to"
3840,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,hide it. It is a devoted parent and when taken sufficiently young is
3841,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,easily tamed and becomes strongly attached to its benefactor.
3842,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,
3843,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,With the coming of the first robin we feel sure that spring is here.
3844,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"Looking out of the window, we see our little friend with his red breast"
3845,WHEN ROBIN RED-BREAST ARRIVES,"shining in the sunlight, singing his simple song of faith and hope."

3892,LITTLE SIR CAT,on his pillow found a flea.
3893,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3894,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, pretty soon they came to a meadow in which a little bush was on"
3895,LITTLE SIR CAT,"fire. And right there close beside it, was the poor Lady Bug flapping"
3896,LITTLE SIR CAT,her red wings wildly in fear and panic for hidden under the bush were
3897,LITTLE SIR CAT,all her little lady bugs.
3898,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3899,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Oh, save my children!"" she cried."
3900,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3901,LITTLE SIR CAT,Little Sir Cat scrambled under the thicket but the brambles kept
3902,LITTLE SIR CAT,"catching in his boot straps and pulling him back. So he kicked them off,"
3903,LITTLE SIR CAT,"taking care not to burn his bare toes on the hot stubbles, and carefully"
3904,LITTLE SIR CAT,felt his way through the smoke until he finally reached the nest near
3905,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the heart of the thicket. There lay all the Lady Bug's children,"
3906,LITTLE SIR CAT,"hundreds of them huddled together, frightened and smothered nearly to"
3907,LITTLE SIR CAT,death.
3908,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3909,LITTLE SIR CAT,[Illustration: THE FIRE ENGINE]
3910,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3911,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Oh, I hope they are not quite dead,"" he said, tenderly picking up the"
3912,LITTLE SIR CAT,"smallest one. ""But what shall I do now? How can I carry them all out?"""
3913,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3914,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Then, quick as a wink, before the fire reached him, he picked them all"
3915,LITTLE SIR CAT,up and put them in his hat.
3916,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3917,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Hurry, my brave fireman!"" called the Mother Lady Bug; ""save my"
3918,LITTLE SIR CAT,"treasures."""
3919,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3920,LITTLE SIR CAT,"And in less time than I can take to tell it, he carried them out of"
3921,LITTLE SIR CAT,danger.
3922,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3923,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Just then up came Dapple Gray, so Little Sir Cat said good-by and rode"
3924,LITTLE SIR CAT,away.
3925,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3926,LITTLE SIR CAT,"By-and-by, he whispered to Dapple Gray, ""Yonder stands the lady who rode"
3927,LITTLE SIR CAT,"you far away. Do you want to run right by her, or do you want to stay"
3928,LITTLE SIR CAT,"behind this clump of bushes until she walks away?"""
3929,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3930,LITTLE SIR CAT,Dapple Gray made no reply. He stood perfectly still and didn't even peek
3931,LITTLE SIR CAT,around until the lady was out of sight. So that was answer enough for
3932,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Little Sir Cat, and he rode off towards a little church, for it was"
3933,LITTLE SIR CAT,vesper time and the bell was ringing for the people to come to worship.
3934,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Pretty soon the organ began to play, so he stopped to listen, and so did"
3935,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the stars and the big moon up in the sky. They didn't move, but shone"
3936,LITTLE SIR CAT,right down on the little white building. After a while he got down and
3937,LITTLE SIR CAT,led Dapple Gray into a grove of trees and lay down on some leaves for
3938,LITTLE SIR CAT,the night. And pretty soon you shall hear how he and his pony had
3939,LITTLE SIR CAT,"another adventure,--unless--"

3949,LITTLE SIR CAT,There was an old woman lived under a hill

3957,LITTLE SIR CAT,The Little Goose-Girl
3958,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3959,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3960,LITTLE SIR CAT,Many years ago there lived a little goose-girl named Helena. Every
3961,LITTLE SIR CAT,"morning at sunrise she left the hut where her mother lived, and trudged"
3962,LITTLE SIR CAT,away in the midst of her flock of geese. All day long she stayed in the
3963,LITTLE SIR CAT,"fields with them to see that they did not wander away, and in the"
3964,LITTLE SIR CAT,evening she brought them back to the village.
3965,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3966,LITTLE SIR CAT,"The hamlet she lived in was very small, and Helena had the care of all"
3967,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the geese in the place. Ten of the flock belonged to her mother, the"
3968,LITTLE SIR CAT,rest belonged to the neighbors.
3969,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3970,LITTLE SIR CAT,Helena was almost as fat as the fattest goose in her flock. Over her
3971,LITTLE SIR CAT,"plump, freckled face she wore a flat cap, and her flaxen hair in two"
3972,LITTLE SIR CAT,"long braids down her back. Her waist was black, without any sleeves and"
3973,LITTLE SIR CAT,"opened in the front, while the sleeves of her smock were full and long."
3974,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Her skirt was very short and full, and plaited all around the waist. In"
3975,LITTLE SIR CAT,"summer she went barefooted, but in winter she wore thick stockings and"
3976,LITTLE SIR CAT,wooden shoes.
3977,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3978,LITTLE SIR CAT,"She carried in her hand a long stick, with which to manage her goose"
3979,LITTLE SIR CAT,"family, but she was kind-hearted and never struck them hard. Her little"
3980,LITTLE SIR CAT,"dog, Hero, helped her keep them in order. He was so well trained that"
3981,LITTLE SIR CAT,"when they wandered away, he would bark and snap at them until he"
3982,LITTLE SIR CAT,frightened them back.
3983,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3984,LITTLE SIR CAT,"[Illustration: THE GOOSE GIRL PUB. BY NAT. ART CO., N. Y.]"
3985,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3986,LITTLE SIR CAT,Every morning at sunrise the geese waited in front of the huts for
3987,LITTLE SIR CAT,Helena. Amid a great squawking and hissing they were collected from door
3988,LITTLE SIR CAT,"to door, and when the flock was all gathered, Helena drove them off to"
3989,LITTLE SIR CAT,"the feeding ground, a low flat marshy place, near the river, where they"
3990,LITTLE SIR CAT,delighted to waddle in the greenish pools and coarse grasses.
3991,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3992,LITTLE SIR CAT,Helena had collected a pile of stones on a dry spot which was a little
3993,LITTLE SIR CAT,"higher than the marshy ground around it, and here she would sit on her"
3994,LITTLE SIR CAT,"throne, like a queen looking over her goose kingdom."
3995,LITTLE SIR CAT,
3996,LITTLE SIR CAT,"When dinner time came, she would take from a basket a slice of very"
3997,LITTLE SIR CAT,"coarse bread, almost black, a piece of cheese, or a slice of thick, raw"
3998,LITTLE SIR CAT,"sausage. When she had finished eating, she would take from the same"
3999,LITTLE SIR CAT,"basket her spinning, and with her distaff she twirled the thread around"
4000,LITTLE SIR CAT,and drew it through her fingers. This was the old-fashioned way of
4001,LITTLE SIR CAT,"spinning, and even now one often sees girls and women with their"
4002,LITTLE SIR CAT,distaffs spinning in the fields while they watch their cows or sheep or
4003,LITTLE SIR CAT,geese.
4004,LITTLE SIR CAT,
4005,LITTLE SIR CAT,"There were many beautiful flowers growing in the marshy land, and when"
4006,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Helena grew tired of spinning, she gathered violets and forget-me-nots."
4007,LITTLE SIR CAT,She would make a wreath of blue lilies and yellow dandelions and hang it
4008,LITTLE SIR CAT,"about her neck. Sometimes she would make a collar for her dog, and once"
4009,LITTLE SIR CAT,"she made a wreath for a pet gander, but he twisted his long neck and ate"
4010,LITTLE SIR CAT,"up the flowers, at which Helena laughed, showing that she was a happy"
4011,LITTLE SIR CAT,"little girl, although she did have to tend the geese all day."

4032,FEBRUARY,Dear Boys and Girls--Did it ever occur to you that February is a famous
4033,FEBRUARY,"month, for in it were born two of the greatest men that ever lived,"
4034,FEBRUARY,George Washington and Abraham Lincoln?
4035,FEBRUARY,
4036,FEBRUARY,Perhaps the determination of Washington never to allow himself to be
4037,FEBRUARY,discouraged in the face of tremendous difficulties and treachery stands
4038,FEBRUARY,out as one of the biggest factors in his character.
4039,FEBRUARY,
4040,FEBRUARY,Looking back through history every boy as he gazes on the face of
4041,FEBRUARY,"Washington feels a thrill of pride; the Father of His Country, the man"
4042,FEBRUARY,"who never told a lie, the man who never admitted there was such a word"
4043,FEBRUARY,"as ""fail."""
4044,FEBRUARY,
4045,FEBRUARY,"And when we turn to Lincoln, who in the crisis of our country's welfare"
4046,FEBRUARY,"stood like a rock and brought order out of chaos, preserved the Union,"
4047,FEBRUARY,"""now and forever,"" and, with ""malice toward none,"" brought the men of"
4048,FEBRUARY,the North and the men of the South under the Stars and Stripes again as
4049,FEBRUARY,brothers--we find the Savior of our Country.
4050,FEBRUARY,
4051,FEBRUARY,For the boy of to-day two such men as Washington and Lincoln are an
4052,FEBRUARY,inspiration. Human nature was just the same in those days as
4053,FEBRUARY,now--politics were just as corrupt and morals just as bad--but each of
4054,FEBRUARY,"those men shone out with the attributes of greatness--courage, honesty"
4055,FEBRUARY,and truth.
4056,FEBRUARY,
4057,FEBRUARY,And for the girl of to-day who realizes how the mothers of those two men
4058,FEBRUARY,gave to this country each a hero; how those mothers by early training
4059,FEBRUARY,and instruction brought their boys up to reverence courage and honesty
4060,FEBRUARY,"and truth, there is an inspiration; for the sweetest word that is"
4061,FEBRUARY,murmured in the nursery or whispered in prayer on the battlefield is
4062,FEBRUARY,Mother.

4072,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,

4074,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"The Capitol in the city of Rome was built on a high, steep hill called"
4075,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"the Tarpeian Rock. When in 390 B. C. the Gauls entered Rome, after"
4076,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"having defeated the Roman Army, most of the citizens fled, except a few"
4077,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"who had taken refuge on this steep hill. One very dark night, the Gauls"
4078,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,attempted to climb the steepest part and capture the Capitol. The Roman
4079,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"sentinels were all fast asleep, and the enemy had nearly reached the"
4080,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"top, when suddenly some geese began to cackle and raise a great hub-bub."
4081,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"The noise awakened a Roman soldier named Marcus Manlius, who rushed out"
4082,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,to the spot just in time to throw down the Gauls and save the Capitol.
4083,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4084,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"After this, the Gauls agreed to leave the city for a thousand pounds of"
4085,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"gold, but the Romans took so long to weigh it, that Camillus arrived"
4086,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"with a big army just in time. ""Rome buys her freedom with iron!"" he"
4087,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"cried, and attacking the Gauls, drove them out in great confusion. But"
4088,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"if it hadn't been for the geese, who were wide awake and not sound"
4089,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"asleep like the Roman sentinels, Rome would have been captured that dark"

4100,THE CARNIVAL,to pass.
4101,THE CARNIVAL,
4102,THE CARNIVAL,"First, however, I shall buy for you each a little blue gauze mask; for"
4103,THE CARNIVAL,you cannot even peep at Carnival unmasked. And if any of you can wear
4104,THE CARNIVAL,"linen dusters with hoods attached, all the better. Don't leave a square"
4105,THE CARNIVAL,"inch of skin unprotected, I warn you."
4106,THE CARNIVAL,
4107,THE CARNIVAL,"Besides the little masks, you may buy, each of you, a whole bushel of"

4110,THE CARNIVAL,"with confetti but on no account to pull--at least, not yet."
4111,THE CARNIVAL,
4112,THE CARNIVAL,The crowds are gathering. Pretty peasant girls in their holiday attire
4113,THE CARNIVAL,"of bright petticoats, laced bodices, and white frilled caps; stray"
4114,THE CARNIVAL,dominoes; richly dressed ladies with mask in hand; carriages so
4115,THE CARNIVAL,decorated with flowers as to be artistically hidden--even the wheels
4116,THE CARNIVAL,"covered with batiste--blue, pink, purple, green or buff. Even the"
4117,THE CARNIVAL,"sidewalk, as we pass, is fringed with chairs at a franc each."
4118,THE CARNIVAL,
4119,THE CARNIVAL,"The ""Cours"" is gay with suspended banners, bright with festooned"
4120,THE CARNIVAL,balconies and merry faces. Sidewalks and streets are filled with

4122,THE CARNIVAL,if they are run over.
4123,THE CARNIVAL,
4124,THE CARNIVAL,"Let us hasten to our balcony, for here passes a band of musicians, in"

4127,THE CARNIVAL,"It is ""the theater""--an open car of puppets--but the puppets are men;"
4128,THE CARNIVAL,"all attached to cords held in the hand of the giant, who sits in"
4129,THE CARNIVAL,imposing state above them on the top of the car which is on a level with
4130,THE CARNIVAL,the third-story balconies.
4131,THE CARNIVAL,
4132,THE CARNIVAL,The giant lifts his hand and the puppets whirl and jump. But alas! his
4133,THE CARNIVAL,"head is too high. His hat is swept off by the hanging festoons, and the"
4134,THE CARNIVAL,"giant must ride bare-headed, in danger of sunstroke."
4135,THE CARNIVAL,
4136,THE CARNIVAL,Next behind the car moves in military order a regiment of mounted
4137,THE CARNIVAL,"grasshoppers. Their sleek, shining bodies of green satin, their gauzy"
4138,THE CARNIVAL,"wings and antennae, snub noses and big eyes, are all absolutely perfect"
4139,THE CARNIVAL,to the eye; but--they are of the size of men.
4140,THE CARNIVAL,
4141,THE CARNIVAL,"You lower your mask to see more clearly, you are lost in wonder at the"
4142,THE CARNIVAL,"perfect illusion, your mouth is wide open with ""Ohs!"" and ""Ahs!"" when"

4144,THE CARNIVAL,cut off your ears and rush sifting down your neck.

4151,THE CARNIVAL,battle begins and waxes fierce.
4152,THE CARNIVAL,
4153,THE CARNIVAL,"But they are crowded on. A colossal stump follows, trailing with mosses"
4154,THE CARNIVAL,"and vines. Upon it a bird's nest filled with young, their mouths wide"
4155,THE CARNIVAL,"open for food; wonderful, because the artistic skill is so perfect that,"
4156,THE CARNIVAL,"although so immense, they seem living and not unnatural."
4157,THE CARNIVAL,
4158,THE CARNIVAL,"Up and down the procession sweeps. Up one side the wide ""Cours"" and down"
4159,THE CARNIVAL,"the other; the space within filled with the merry surging crowd, under"
4160,THE CARNIVAL,the feet of the horses it would seem. But no matter. Horses and men and

4169,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4170,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4171,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"For several years, Robert Bruce, the hero King of Scotland, was an"
4172,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,outlaw with but a few followers. He even had to leave his beloved
4173,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"Scotland at one time, and hide himself on a small island off the coast"
4174,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,of Ireland.
4175,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4176,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"He had only a wretched hut to live in, although he was a king, but he"
4177,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"was as patient as he was brave, and willing to suffer hardships if he"
4178,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,could only free his native land.
4179,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4180,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"While lying on his bed one day, he noticed a spider who was spinning its"
4181,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,web. Time after time it failed to run its slender thread from one beam
4182,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,to another. Six times it tried and as many times it failed. This was
4183,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,just the number of battles that Bruce had been defeated by the English.
4184,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4185,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"""If the spider tries again,"" he said to himself, sitting up on his bed"
4186,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"and watching the determined little insect intently, ""if the spider tries"
4187,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"again, so will I!"" Once more the spider tried, and this time with"
4188,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"success. Bruce jumped from his bed, and in a few days was back in"
4189,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,Scotland.
4190,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4191,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"It was indeed a happy omen, for from that time the tide turned in his"
4192,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"favor, and gradually he won back all the cities and castles which the"
4193,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,English had conquered. And so Bruce freed Scotland and won back his

4307,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4308,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4309,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,There was once a horse named Bucephalus whom nobody could ride except
4310,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"his master, the famous Alexander the Great; and the reason was because"
4311,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,this horse was afraid of his own shadow. He wasn't afraid of anything
4312,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"else, for he would carry his master into the thickest of the fight"
4313,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,without flinching.
4314,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4315,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"In those days every boy was trained to be a warrior, as well as to be"
4316,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"proficient in all kinds of knowledge, and as Alexander was a very bright"
4317,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,youth and loved reading as well as fighting his father sent for the
4318,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"famous Aristotle to be his teacher, under whose teaching he grew up to"
4319,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,be a very fine young man. Every night when Alexander went to bed he
4320,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"placed his favorite book, Homer's ""Iliad,"" under his pillow with his"
4321,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,sword. Soon he became very expert in all manly sports and excelled every
4322,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"one at his father's court, especially in riding. But had he not been a"
4323,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,very bright and observing youth he never would have been able to ride
4324,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"Bucephalus, notwithstanding his splendid horsemanship."
4325,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4326,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,The way it happened was that one day this horse was offered for sale to
4327,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"his father, the King, but none of the grooms or nobles could mount him."
4328,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"Alexander, who had been very carefully watching the beautiful white"
4329,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"animal, noticed that Bucephalus was afraid of his own shadow. He"
4330,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,therefore turned his head toward the sun and after patting the animal
4331,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,until he grew quiet mounted and rode him without any trouble. After that
4332,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,he was always his favorite charger.
4333,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,
4334,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,When Alexander set out to conquer the Persians Bucephalus was the first
4335,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,"to swim across the River Granicus with Alexander, amid a shower of"
4336,LITTLE STORIES OF FAMOUS ANIMALS,arrows and spears.

4638,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4639,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4640,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"Suppose we ""go a-Maying"" among old traditions and see with what"
4641,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"ceremonies our English ancestors welcomed the ""merry month."" We do not"
4642,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"celebrate the first day of May to any extent in this country, but in"
4643,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"England, where the season is much earlier than ours, and the earth is"
4644,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"already covered with wild flowers, May-day is more fitly celebrated; but"
4645,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,even in England the old customs have sadly fallen away.
4646,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4647,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,Once upon a time every village had its annual setting up of the
4648,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"May-pole, which was consecrated to the Goddess of Flowers, and early on"
4649,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"May morning the young people went out to ""gather the May."" The first"
4650,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,thing was to select the May-pole. The landed gentry allowed the
4651,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"villagers the choice of a suitable tree on their domains. A tall,"
4652,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"straight sapling having been selected, it was speedily cut down and"
4653,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,dragged to the village green by oxen gayly decorated with flowers and
4654,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,bright colored ribbons. Following after came the youths and maidens with
4655,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"wreaths of flowers, which they twined around cottage doorways on their"
4656,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"way to the green, where they were to choose from among their number a"
4657,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,Lord and Lady of May.
4658,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4659,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"After a bower was built for them and the May-pole set up, there were"
4660,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"merry dances, the revellers donning mask and costume to represent Robin"
4661,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"Hood, Friar Tuck, Maid Marian, Much the Miller's Son, Little John, Will"
4662,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,Scarlet and all the other famous characters of merry Sherwood. Pantomime
4663,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"was also indulged in, for this was a simple age, when simple pleasures"
4664,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,satisfied the country people. Into the ring would come a hobby-horse and
4665,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"a dragon, the former ambling and prancing about, while the latter hissed"
4666,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"and shook his wings, to the great delight of the spectators. There were"
4667,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"also morris-dancers, with bells attached to their knees and elbows, who"
4668,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,danced and capered musically. After this came trials of skill in archery
4669,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"by Robin Hood and his fellows, and when all these amusements grew"
4670,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"tiresome, the villagers thronged about the May-pole and spent the"
4671,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,remainder of the day in dancing.
4672,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4673,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,But these May-day observances were not confined only to the country. In
4674,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"London at one time tall poles were erected on May morning, and green"
4675,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,arbors and branches decorated the streets. It was a great day for the
4676,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"milkmaids and chimney-sweeps, who paraded the streets in companies,"
4677,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,begging a trifle from their customers.
4678,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4679,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"The leader of the chimney-sweeps, called ""Jack in the Green,"" was"
4680,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"covered, with the exception of his legs, with green boughs, garlands and"
4681,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"nosegays. He looked like a dancing bouquet, as he moved up and down the"
4682,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,street. Many a penny the sweeps collected from the admiring bystanders.
4683,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"This was a custom up to about one hundred years ago, and will perhaps"
4684,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,remind some of my little readers of the ragamuffins who parade the
4685,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"streets of New York on Thanksgiving Day, begging a penny from every"
4686,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,passer-by.
4687,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,
4688,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"Finally, many abuses arose in the observance of the day. In 1644"
4689,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"Parliament passed an act forbidding the erection of May-poles. Later,"
4690,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"during the restoration of the gay Charles the Second, the May-poles came"
4691,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"back and flourished for a long time. Gradually, however, as the ancient"
4692,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"simplicity of manners departed from the lower orders of the people, who"
4693,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,"were its chief upholders, the May-day festival fell into disuse, and now"
4694,MAY DAY FROLICS IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND,there are neither May-poles nor morris-dancers nor Jacks in the Green.

4706,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"A big Black Spider was spinning away,"
4707,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Spinning her lacey web all day;
4708,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And when she had finished it, close to the wall"
4709,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,She curled herself up in a round black ball.
4710,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4711,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Lazily buzzing, buzzing away,"
4712,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,A little Blue Fly was buzzing all day.
4713,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Into the open window he flew
4714,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And close to the Spider's web he drew.
4715,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4716,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Oh, what a pretty piece of lace"
4717,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Swinging away in the window space!"""
4718,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"The little Blue Fly remarked to himself,"
4719,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,As he carefully crawled on the narrow shelf.
4720,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4721,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Then he brushed the dirt from his gauzy wing
4722,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And watched the spider web swing and swing.
4723,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Now this little Fly was a mischievous Fly,"
4724,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,And there wasn't a bit of green in his eye!
4725,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4726,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"So, as he watched it swing and swing,"
4727,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,He thought 'twould be fun to cut the string.
4728,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Then Mrs. Spider's hammock would fall
4729,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Down with a somersault off the wall.
4730,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4731,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Creeping up to her hiding place,"
4732,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,He gave a pull on the flimsy lace.
4733,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Down one end of the hammock fell,"
4734,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,While the Big Black Spider gave a yell.
4735,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4736,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Out thro' the window the little Fly flew;
4737,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"'Twas safer out there for him, he knew."
4738,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"And he said, as he winked his little blue eye:"

4758,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4759,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4760,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Bennie woke up on Easter morning and saw a little rabbit with a big bow
4761,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,of blue ribbon around his neck standing in the doorway.
4762,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4763,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Come along!"" he said. ""I'm going to give you a ride on my back."""
4764,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4765,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,In a few minutes Bennie had on his clothes and tiptoeing down the
4766,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"stairs, they slipped out of the front door."
4767,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4768,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Hold on to my ears!"" said the rabbit, and away they went down the"
4769,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,garden walk. When they reached the barnyard the rabbit stopped before
4770,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"the haystack, and pulling out a small basket and a big silver spoon,"
4771,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,said to Bennie:
4772,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4773,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Take this basket and come with me to the hen-house. If we get there"
4774,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,before the fairies we will find the pretty colored eggs which the hens
4775,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"lay for Easter. But hurry, for we must get there first."""
4776,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4777,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"They opened the door quietly, just as the big Red Rooster began to crow."
4778,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"""Lift up the eggs with the silver spoon,"" said the rabbit, as they"
4779,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"peeped into the nests; ""don't touch one with your hand or it will lose"
4780,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"its lovely color."" Soon the basket was full. ""Come on,"" cried the"
4781,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"rabbit; ""hurry up and get on my back; it's getting late."" Bennie jumped"
4782,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"on, but just as they started off four little chickens ran out of their"
4783,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,coop and screamed:
4784,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4785,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,_Cock-a-doodle doo!
4786,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,You've got my egg of blue;
4787,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"My yellow one, my purple one,"
4788,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"My little green one, too!_"
4789,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4790,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Suddenly he found himself in his own little bed, while outside the happy"
4791,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,Easter bells were ringing. He wondered where his little friend the
4792,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"rabbit had disappeared to, and the four little chickens."
4793,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,
4794,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"Then he looked down at the counterpane, and what do you suppose he saw."
4795,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"A whole nest full of beautiful, painted Easter eggs with the funniest"
4796,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,faces and the brightest colors. Bennie gave a squeal of delight and
4797,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,hopped out of bed to dress so that he could show his treasure to all the
4798,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,"other children he knew, but in his excitement forgot all about the dear"
4799,THE SPIDER AND THE FLY,little bunny.

4953,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,otherwise how would they ever get anywhere if these faithful friends

4955,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4956,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,The next thing Dick did was to collect for the fire the dry buffalo dung

4960,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"heap was a mass of dull, glowing coals; then the tin coffee pail and the"
4961,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"frying pan, and then, thank goodness!--for Dick was always"
4962,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,hungry--supper.
4963,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4964,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"After that they pulled down the big, long canvas back of the wagon"
4965,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"cover, which was spread double over the top of the wagon during the day,"
4966,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"and fastened it to the ground with pegs, and under this slanting roof,"
4967,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"with their blankets between them and the earth, with their toes towards"
4968,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"the fire, they slept quite comfortably through the night."
4969,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4970,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,The oxen and the ponies knew enough not to stray any great distance from
4971,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"the campfire, and if frightened at anything would come rushing back,"
4972,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"helter-skelter, for protection. They know that on the prairie man is"
4973,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,their best friend and protector.
4974,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4975,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""What are those figures away over there to the westward?"" said Dick's"
4976,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,father. Uncle Billy shaded his eyes with his hand and looked in that
4977,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"direction for a few minutes without answering. ""Don't know,"" he replied,"
4978,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"uneasily. ""They look like horses, but I don't see any riders."" ""Nor I,"""
4979,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"replied Dick's father, ""but those wily redskins have a way of hanging"
4980,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,over the far-side of the animal so's to deceive any one who happens to
4981,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"catch sight of them. They don't act like wild horses."""
4982,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4983,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"It was an anxious moment. Neither man spoke for some time, but rode"
4984,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"along quietly, keeping a sharp look-out, however, in order to detect the"
4985,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"slightest change in the appearance of the figures to the westward. ""They"
4986,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"seem to be following our way,"" suggested Uncle Billy about an hour"
4987,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"later. ""Supposing we pitch camp to-night a little earlier. That clump of"
4988,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,trees yonder will give us some protection in case they turn out to be
4989,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"redskins."""
4990,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4991,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""Good plan,"" murmured Dick's father, turning in the direction of the"
4992,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"trees. ""We needn't let on we're worried to the women folks,"" he added,"
4993,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""we'll just wait and see how things turn out. Maybe nothing will"
4994,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"happen."""
4995,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
4996,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,But something did happen. About midnight Dick's father awoke with a
4997,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,start. A shadow fell across the opening in the canvas. In another moment
4998,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"he was grappling with an Indian. Over and over he rolled, but the Indian"
4999,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"had found his match. Dick's father was a powerful man, and, whipping out"
5000,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"his revolver, shot him dead. None too soon, for Uncle Billy was being"
5001,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"hard pressed by a number of redskins, two of whom he had already laid"
5002,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,low with his rifle.
5003,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5004,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""Get into the wagon, Mother!"" yelled Dick's father, ""and pick off a few"
5005,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"with your rifle!"" Mother and Aunt Mary were soon blazing away from the"
5006,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"canvas fort, and after a short time the Indians retired, evidently to"
5007,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,consider what was the next best move.
5008,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5009,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""Where's Dick?"" said his father, looking around anxiously."
5010,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5011,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""Here I am!"" came a voice, and sure enough, under the wagon, crouching"
5012,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"down behind the bag of kindling wood, which he had used for a shield,"
5013,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"was Dick. ""I cracked two, dad!"" he called out, ""one Injun was sneaking"
5014,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"up by the pole, when I dropped him; he's out there now, I can just see"
5015,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"his outline."""
5016,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5017,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"Just then, a number of arrows fell around the wagon, and Uncle Billy"
5018,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,caught sight of half a dozen shadowy figures creeping along the grass in
5019,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"the shadows of the trees to the right. ""Look out,"" he whispered, ""let"
5020,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"'em get pretty close and then give 'em hail Columbia."""
5021,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5022,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"It was a fierce struggle, for the Indians outnumbered our brave"
5023,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"defenders. Twice the redskins rushed up close to the wagon, only to be"
5024,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,beaten off in time by courage and good marksmanship. Both Dick's father
5025,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"and Uncle Billy were ""nipped"" by arrows, but not seriously hurt, and"
5026,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,Dick himself had a narrow escape from being captured by a daring enemy
5027,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"who sneaked up behind. But Dick turned and saw him just in time,"
5028,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,otherwise our story would have had a sad ending. Mother and Aunt Mary
5029,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"bravely kept up the firing, and the Indians, thinking that there were"
5030,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"more defenders than there were, finally withdrew, much to the relief of"
5031,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,the besieged.
5032,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,
5033,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"There was no more sleep in the camp that night, and in the morning, at"
5034,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"the first break of day, Dick's father went out to investigate. Two dead"
5035,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,Indians close to the camp testified to the good aim of its defenders.
5036,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"""They took the other dead and wounded with them,"" said Dick's father,"
5037,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"turning to his brave boy, ""they didn't dare come in so close to get"
5038,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"them. Here's the fellow you shot, sonny--I remember he was just about to"
5039,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,tomahawk me as you shot him in the nick of time--guess you saved your
5040,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,"dad's life,"" and Dick felt as proud as Punch when his father slapped him"
5041,ACROSS THE PRAIRIE!,on the back like a man.

5084,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Please, professor,"" said tender-hearted Little Sir Cat, holding up his"

5174,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5175,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5176,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"Jack and Grace were in the nursery playing with their toys, when"
5177,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"suddenly they were startled by a tiny voice calling out ""Good-by!"""
5178,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5179,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"They looked up quickly, and to their surprise their little tin airship"
5180,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,was slowly rising from the floor. In another moment it sailed across the
5181,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"room and out of the top of the window, which was down a little to let in"
5182,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,fresh air. The little man at the steering wheel waved his hand as the
5183,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,airship disappeared. Jack rushed to the window.
5184,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5185,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Grace, Grace!"" he shouted, ""did you ever hear of such a thing? Come on."
5186,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"I'm going to run outside and see where it goes."" Both children hurried"
5187,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"down stairs and out on the sidewalk. Sure enough, just over the top of"
5188,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,the next house they could distinguish their Christmas present ascending
5189,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,higher and higher into the clear blue sky.
5190,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5191,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,Just then something fluttered at their feet. Jack stooped down and
5192,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,picked up a piece of paper on which was written:
5193,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5194,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Sorry I didn't have time to tell you as the airship was under way and I"
5195,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"didn't dare make a turn inside the room, but if you both will come up"
5196,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"on the roof, I will come back and tell you something lovely."""
5197,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5198,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Let's!"" exclaimed Grace, who had read the note over Jack's shoulder;"
5199,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,and in another moment both children were running up to the attic. After
5200,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"some difficulty, they raised the little door in the ceiling and stood"
5201,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"upon the roof. Sure enough, just overhead and about to descend was an"
5202,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"airship. But, goodness me! it was a regular airship, just like the kind"
5203,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"they had seen in pictures, and not the little toy machine which they had"
5204,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,but a few minutes before seen sailing out of the window and up over the
5205,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,next house. Nor did the lovely fairy who now alighted from the airship
5206,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"look anything like the queer little painted man. ""Hello!"" she said, in a"
5207,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"very friendly voice: ""would you like to take a sail?"""
5208,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5209,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"Jack helped Grace in, and before long they were flying above the clouds,"
5210,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"which looked like huge snow banks below them, white and fluffy."
5211,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"Everything was blue about them, and the air seemed full of perfume."
5212,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5213,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Isn't it lovely, Jack!"" exclaimed Grace. ""I'm so glad I came!"""
5214,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5215,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""So am I,"" replied her brother, ""but I wonder where we are going. I"
5216,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,don't see the earth any more; we must be going somewhere. Where are you
5217,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"taking us, little Fairy Queen?"" he called out, and he and Grace waited"
5218,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,anxiously for the answer.
5219,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5220,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Nowhere!"" she answered."
5221,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5222,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Don't you know where Nowhere is?"""
5223,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5224,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Well, not exactly,"" replied Jack. ""I've often heard of it, but I've"
5225,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"never been there."""
5226,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5227,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,Just then the airship swerved to the right and in a few seconds landed
5228,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,gracefully on the broad steps of a beautiful castle. Everything was
5229,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"blue, even the tall chimney was built of blue bricks. The fairy had"
5230,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"hardly turned off the power, and the big airship was still quivering,"
5231,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"when the castle door opened, and a beautiful princess, dressed all in"
5232,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"blue, came graciously forward. The only thing about her that wasn't blue"
5233,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"was her long flowing hair, which was of the most wonderful golden hue"
5234,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"that Grace had ever seen. ""How do you do?"" she said in a sweet voice."
5235,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Come in. Have you come from very far away?"""
5236,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5237,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""We don't know, Princess,"" answered Jack, bowing politely, while Grace"
5238,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"made a pretty courtesy; ""we really don't know how far we have come, nor"
5239,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"just where we are."""
5240,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5241,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Well, I'll tell you then,"" answered the lovely blue Princess, taking"
5242,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,them each by the hand and walking between them through the open castle
5243,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"door; ""at least, I'll tell you where you are and then after that you can"
5244,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"tell me where you came from, and then we'll know a little more about"
5245,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"each other."""
5246,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5247,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""How beautiful you are,"" said Grace as they all three sat down on a big"
5248,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,blue sofa in the big blue hall of the stately blue castle.
5249,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5250,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Am I, dear?"" said the Princess, looking at Grace with a smile, ""and why"
5251,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"do you think so?"""
5252,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5253,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""I never saw such wonderfully beautiful gold hair,"" exclaimed Grace,"
5254,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"admiringly, gradually getting over her bashfulness."
5255,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5256,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"The lovely Blue Princess laughed. ""When I was a little girl,"" she said,"
5257,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"taking hold of Jack's hand so as not to leave him out in the cold, ""the"
5258,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"Sun Man told me if I would comb my hair every morning for a whole year,"
5259,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"at break of day, when he first got up, that it would turn gold. And so"
5260,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,every morning for a whole year I got up at peep o' day and stood by the
5261,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"east window and combed my hair."""
5262,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5263,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""And it did?"" said Jack, speaking for the first time since they had"
5264,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"entered the Blue Castle. ""Why don't you try it, Grace? You love gold"
5265,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"hair so much,"" and he gave her braid a mischievous pull behind the back"
5266,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,of the Blue Princess.
5267,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5268,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"Grace gave a little scream. ""Don't, Jack""--and then, to her surprise,"
5269,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,she found herself with her arms around her new dolly in the big armchair
5270,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,in their own room at home. She looked over to where Jack was busily
5271,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"engaged with his train of cars. ""I must have been dreaming,"" Grace"
5272,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"exclaimed, and as she looked at her golden-haired doll, with the"
5273,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"beautiful blue dress, she laughed and said:"
5274,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,
5275,THE LAND OF NOWHERE,"""Oh, dolly, I guess it was you I dreamed was the beautiful Blue"

5310,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5311,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""If you want to find your fortune?"" said the little bear, ""follow me,"""
5312,LITTLE SIR CAT,and he led Little Sir Cat down a narrow path till they came to a cave in
5313,LITTLE SIR CAT,"a great rock. And, oh my, it looked dark inside, but the little bear"
5314,LITTLE SIR CAT,"wasn't afraid, and by-and-by he found a candle. And when he had lighted"
5315,LITTLE SIR CAT,"it, they went farther into the big dark cave till they came to a little"
5316,LITTLE SIR CAT,"iron door. But before the little bear opened it, he said, ""If anybody"
5317,LITTLE SIR CAT,"speaks to you, you mustn't say anything but 'Bumpty bump!'"" Then the"
5318,LITTLE SIR CAT,little bear opened the door and there sat twenty-one little dwarfs at a
5319,LITTLE SIR CAT,table filling little bags with gold.
5320,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5321,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""What are you doing here?"" they asked, all in one voice."
5322,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5323,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Bumpty bump!"" replied the little bear."
5324,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5325,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""And what are _you_ doing here?"" And, oh, dear me! for a moment Little"
5326,LITTLE SIR CAT,Sir Cat forgot what the little bear had told him. And if he hadn't
5327,LITTLE SIR CAT,"remembered to say ""Bumpty bump!"" pretty quick I guess something dreadful"
5328,LITTLE SIR CAT,might have happened.
5329,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5330,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Then all the little dwarfs looked frightened to death, and they"
5331,LITTLE SIR CAT,whispered together and tried to hide the bags of gold under the
5332,LITTLE SIR CAT,"three-legged stools. But the little bear wouldn't go away, and of course"
5333,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Little Sir Cat did just what the little bear did, for he didn't know"
5334,LITTLE SIR CAT,"what else to do, you know."
5335,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5336,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Well, after a while the dwarfs asked, ""What do you want?"" And Little Sir"
5337,LITTLE SIR CAT,"Cat replied, ""Bumpty bump!"" And then the little dwarfs looked at one"
5338,LITTLE SIR CAT,"another, and, oh, dear me! how they did scowl. But pretty soon one of"
5339,LITTLE SIR CAT,them filled two small bags with gold and gave them to him.
5340,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5341,LITTLE SIR CAT,"""Bumpty bump!"" said Little Sir Cat with a bow, and then the little bear"
5342,LITTLE SIR CAT,opened the door and led him back through the big cave till they came out
5343,LITTLE SIR CAT,into the sunlight again.
5344,LITTLE SIR CAT,
5345,LITTLE SIR CAT,And that's how Little Sir Cat found his fortune.
