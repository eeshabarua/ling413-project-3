560,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose.
561,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;
562,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,"
563,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,To which the sad spectacles ought to belong.
564,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
565,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,So Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause
566,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning;"
567,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"While Chief-Baron Ear sat to balance the laws,"
568,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.
569,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
570,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"“In behalf of the Nose it will quickly appear,"
571,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"And your lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly find"
572,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,"
573,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,Which amounts to possession time out of mind.”
574,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
575,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,Then holding the spectacles up to the Court—
576,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"“Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,"
577,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,"
578,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle."
579,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
580,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"“Again, would your lordship a moment suppose"
581,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"(’Tis a case that has happened, and may be again),"
582,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"That the visage or countenance had not a nose,"
583,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"Pray who would, or who could, wear spectacles then?"
584,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
585,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"“On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,"
586,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"With a reasoning the Court will never condemn,"
587,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,"
588,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.”
589,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
590,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),"
591,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes;
592,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"But what were his arguments few people know,"
593,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,For the Court did not think they were equally wise.
594,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,
595,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"So his lordship decreed with a brave solemn tone,"
596,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"Decisive and clear, without one if or but—"
597,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,"“That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,"
598,A CONTEST BETWEEN NOSE AND EYES,By daylight or candlelight—Eyes should be shut!”

2699,THE NATIONAL FLAG.,field of blue proclaim that union of States constituting our national

2701,THE NATIONAL FLAG.,"together signify union, past and present. The very colors have a language"

4446,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,presents on Christmas Eve by throwing purses in at the open windows of
4447,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,needy people. Purses in those days were knitted of yarn and tied with
4448,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"strings at the open ends. They were not unlike stockings, except that"
4449,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,they had no feet. People began to hang these long empty purses of yarn on
4450,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"their window-sills on Christmas Eve, so that St. Nicholas, as he passed"
4451,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"by, could put money into them. When money became scarce the long purses"
4452,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"were filled with presents instead—useful things for the big people, and"

4454,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,
4455,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"In cold countries, where the windows could not be left open, folks hung"

4458,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"purses went out of fashion they hung up their stockings, which closely"
4459,THE CHRISTMAS STOCKING.,"resembled the old-time purses, so that there would be plenty of room for"
