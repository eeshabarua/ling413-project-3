14,,"Although Fenn's name appears on the cover, and on the title-page, he"
15,,"does not appear to have written more than one of the stories, and the"
16,,story that gave its name to the book was not by him.  There are several
17,,"stories that were not signed by an author's name, so we have a mystery"
18,,there.  They were probably just using Fenn's name to sell the book.
19,,
20,,The target audience appears to be seven- or eight-year-olds; certainly
21,,not the sixteen-year-olds that Fenn generally aimed for.  There are
22,,"twelve items, three of which are rather trivial ""poems"".  The nine short"
23,,"stories all have the theme ""Brave and True"", and vary in their settings"
24,,"from small boarding-schools in the Home Counties, to the Rocky"
25,,Mountains.
26,,
27,,We had originally intended to produce this book merely as a pdf (which
28,,"is of course still available), but with an effort of will we managed to"
29,,"make an xhtml book of it, though this does not have all the delightful"
30,,little line drawings that appeared throughout the eighty pages of the
31,,book.
32,,
33,,It is possible that the principal merit of this book is the way it
34,,throws light on the lives of the younger boarding-school boys and girls
35,,"of the nineteenth century, particularly eight to thirteen year-old"
36,,boys.  I can tell you that not a lot had changed by the time I was
37,,"at such a school, less than fifty years later.  Even the Eton collar"
38,,and the bum-freezer jacket was familiar to me!

56,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",person of importance in the well-known old haunts where he had learned

73,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""Well, he went on calling me an impudent youngster,"" continued Martin,"
74,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""and all that sort of thing--and he tried to set the other fellows"

85,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
86,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","There was a minute's silence, broken by an eager request.  ""But tell us"

90,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""He hadn't the ordering of _that_, thank goodness,"" said Martin"
91,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","fervently.  ""And I was jolly glad he hadn't!  We had some excitement"

97,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","Well, there wasn't much thinking about it.  You just knew that you were"
98,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","ready to blaze at them, and they were popping at you from their"

101,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",

103,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
104,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""Oh, that was nothing,"" said Martin, reddening.  ""He must have got"
105,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","excited or something, for he took a step forward, putting himself in"
106,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","full view, and just then I saw what he didn't see--that there were some"
107,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","of those Boer beggars just under our kopje, and that one of them had"
108,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",raised his rifle to pick off Bullfrog.  So I made a flying leap on to
109,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","his back and knocked him flat, and the bullet that was meant for him"
110,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",just crossed the back of my coat and ripped it up.  Didn't even scratch
111,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","me!"""
112,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
113,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",The little knot of listeners around Martin waited with bated breath for

115,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
116,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""But he didn't escape scot-free after all,"" continued Martin.  ""Ten"
117,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","minutes after that he got shot in the leg.  The bone was fractured, and"
118,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",he couldn't move.  I saw him fall and I pulled him to a little hollow
119,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","under a stone where he'd be safe.  And it was just as well, for the"
120,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",cavalry came up over there when the chase began.  We gave them the
121,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","licking they deserved that day.  But you know all about that."""
122,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
123,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""Wish I'd been you!"" said Martin's old schoolfellow very enviously."
124,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""But what about Bullfrog after that?"""
125,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
126,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""He was taken in the ambulance-cart and put in hospital.  I saw him"
127,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","there and he was getting on all right."""
128,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
129,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""And what did he say?"""
130,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
131,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""He said I'd caught him out again and a lot more.  But it was all"

134,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""I expect he was sorry he'd ever made it hot for you,"" said one of the"

137,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""You ought to have a VC or something for it, _I_ consider,"" said"

139,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.",
140,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","""Rot!"" answered Martin.  ""If a schoolfellow and a shipmate of yours"
141,"BRAVE AND TRUE, BY E DAWSON.","wanted a push out of danger, wouldn't you give it him?  And you wouldn't"

153,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","things for the purpose, and Cook is in a good temper.  But then, cooks"
154,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","are not always amiable, and that's a puzzle; for disagreeable people are"
155,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","generally yellow and stringy, while pleasant folk are pink-and-white and"
156,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","plump, and Mrs Lester's Cook at ""Lombardy"" was extremely plump, so much"
157,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","so that Ned Lester used to laugh at her and say she was fat, whereupon"
158,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","Cook retorted by saying good-humouredly: ""All right, Master Ned, so I"
159,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","am; but you can't have too much of a good thing."""
160,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
161,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","There was doubt about the matter, though.  Cook had a most fiery temper"
162,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","when she was busy, and when that morning Ned went with Tizzy--so called"
163,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",because she was christened Lizzie--and found Cook in her private
164,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","premises--the back kitchen--peeling onions, with a piece of bread stuck"
165,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","at the end of the knife to keep the onion-juice from making her cry, and"
166,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","asked her to make him a small basin of paste, her kitchen majesty"
167,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",uttered a loud snort.
168,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
169,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Which I just shan't,"" she cried; ""and if your Mar was at home you"
170,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","wouldn't dare to ask.  I never did see such a tiresome, worriting boy as"
171,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","you are, Master Ned.  You're always wanting something when I'm busy; and"
172,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",what your master's a-thinking about to give you such long holidays at
173,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","midsummer I don't know."""
174,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
175,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""They aren't long,"" said Ned, indignant at the idea of holidays being"

178,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Don't you contradict, sir, or I'll just tell your Mar; and the sooner"

180,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
181,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","It was on Tizzy's little red lips to say: ""Oh, please do make some"

188,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
189,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",Tizzy placed her arms round her brother's neck and clung tightly while
190,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","he played the restive steed, and raised Cook's ire to red-hot point by"
191,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","purposely kicking one of the Windsor chairs, making it scroop on the"

194,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",onion-juice had affected her.
195,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
196,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Now, just you look here, Master Ned."""
197,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
198,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","But Ned didn't stop to look; for, after the restive kick at the chair,"
199,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","he had broken into a canter, dashed down the garden and through the gate"
200,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","into the meadow, across which he now galloped straight for the new"
201,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","haystack, for only a week before that meadow had been forbidden ground"
202,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","and full of long, waving, flowery strands."
203,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
204,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",The grasshoppers darted right and left from the brown patches where the
205,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",scythes had left their marks; the butterflies fled in their butterfly

207,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
208,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","So did a party of newly-fledged sparrowkins, and, still playing the"

211,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","tall and straight close to the deep river-side, and gave the name"

213,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
214,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","But it was all in vain; nothing would pacify the sobbing child, not even"

216,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","a woman in a print hood, and drawn by a drowsy-looking grey horse at the"
217,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","end of a long tow-rope, bearing a whistling boy seated sidewise on his"
218,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",back and a dishcover-like pail hanging from his collar.
219,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
220,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Oh, I say, don't cry, Tizzy,"" protested Ned, at last, as he felt the"
221,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",hot tears trickling inside his white collar.
222,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
223,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""I can't help it, Teddy,"" she sobbed.  ""I did so want to see the kite"

225,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
226,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Never mind, pussy,"" said her brother; ""I'll get the butterfly-net."""

233,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","please; you do joggle me so.  You'll be going back to school soon, and,"
234,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","now the grass is cut, I did so wa-wa-want to see the kite fly!"""
235,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
236,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""So did I,"" said the boy ruefully.  ""But don't cry, Tiz dear.  Tell me"

238,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
239,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Does it, Teddy?"" she said, looking up wistfully in her brother's face,"
240,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","and then kissing him.  ""There, then: I won't cry any more."""
241,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
242,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",She had hardly spoken when the sunshine returned to her pretty little
243,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","face, for, though she did not know it, that sorrowful countenance had"
244,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","quite softened Cook's heart, and she stood in the kitchen doorway,"
245,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","calling the young people and waving a steaming white basin, which she"
246,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",set down on the window-sill with a bang.
247,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
248,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Here's your paste, Master Ned,"" she shouted; and then, muttering to"
249,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","herself something about being such a ""soft,"" she disappeared."
250,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
251,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",Five minutes later the young folk were in the play-room and Ned was
252,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","covering the framework of his simply-made kite with white paper, Tizzy"
253,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",helping and getting her little fingers pasty the while.  Then a loop was
254,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",made on the centre lath; the wet kite was found to balance well; wings
255,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","were made, and a long string with a marble tied in the thumb of a glove"
256,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",attached to the end for a tail; the ball of new string taken off the top
257,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","of the drawers, and the happy couple went off in high glee to fly the"
258,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",kite.
259,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
260,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""It's half-dry already,"" said Ned.  ""Paste soon dries in hot weather."""
261,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
262,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Do let me carry the string, Teddy,"" cried Tiz; and the next minute she"
263,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","was stepping along with it proudly, while Ned, with his arm through the"
264,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","loop and the kite on his back, looked something like a Knight Crusader"
265,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",with a white shield.
266,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
267,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",The grasshoppers and butterflies scattered; the paper dried rapidly in
268,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","the hot sun, as the kite lay on the grass while the string was fastened,"
269,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",Tizzy having the delightful task of rolling the ball along the grass to
270,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","unwind enough for the first flight; and then, after Ned had thrown a"
271,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","stray goose-feather to make sure which way the wind blew, this being"
272,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","towards the tall poplars, Tizzy was set to hold up the kite as high as"

274,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
275,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Mind and don't tread on its tail, Tiz,"" shouted Ned, as he ran off to"

277,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",
278,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""No; it's stretched right out,"" she cried."

286,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","The string tightened as the boy ran off facing the wind, and, as if glad"

292,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","unwinding more and more string till there was but little left, when the"

298,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",But alas! how short-lived are some of our pleasures!  That fine twine

301,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","higher, the string parted about half-way, and the kite learned that,"
302,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","like many animated creatures, it could not fly alone, for it went off"
303,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","before the wind, falling and falling most pitifully, with Ned going at"
304,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.",full speed after the flying string which trailed over the grass.  He
305,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","caught up to it at last, but too late, for it was just as the kite"
306,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","plunged into the top of one of the highest trees by the river, and there"

309,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","Tizzy came crying up, while Ned jerked and tugged at the string till he"

313,"TWO ROUGH STONES, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.","""Oh,"" she cried, ""and such a beautiful kite as it was!"""

470,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
471,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","Jem could not walk any farther; his ankle was badly hurt, there was no"
472,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","doubt of that, and, brave little lad though he was, his heart sank"
473,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","within him, for he knew all the consequences which might ensue from such"
474,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",a disaster.  It was not the pain that daunted him--Jem would have
475,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",scorned the imputation; neither did he fear to spend a night in the
476,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",forest--he could sleep under a tree as soundly as in his own bed under
477,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","the rafters of his Father's cabin.  It was warm dry weather, and he had"
478,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",a hunch of bread in his pocket; there was nothing therefore to be afraid
479,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","of except Indians, and his Father said there were none in the"
480,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",neighbourhood at present.
481,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
482,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","Jem's mind would have been quite easy on his own account, but he was on"
483,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",his way through the forest to a village on the farther boundary to
484,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","obtain some medicine for his sick Mother, which the doctor had desired"
485,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","she might have without fail that very night.  Our hero, though but"
486,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","eleven years old, had just finished a long day's work, and it was"
487,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","already dusk, but he loved his Mother dearly, and gladly volunteered for"
488,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",the ten-mile walk to fetch the medicine; he did not even wait to eat his
489,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","supper, but, putting it in his pocket to munch on the way, trotted off"
490,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",on his errand.
491,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
492,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","Jem's Father was a small farmer, who had built his own log cabin and"
493,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","cleared his own fields, with no other assistance than that of his little"
494,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","son; this was, however, by no means small, for frontier boys are, of"
495,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","necessity, brought up to be helpful, hardy, and self-denying.  Jem"
496,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",therefore felt his life of incessant labour and deprivation no hardship:
497,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",he was as happy and merry as the day was long.  But the misfortune that
498,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","had now fallen upon the brave little man was so severe and unexpected,"
499,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","he did not know how to bear it.  The thought of the dear, suffering"
500,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","Mother waiting patiently for the medicine which would relieve her, and"
501,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","of the anxious, careworn Father, who would look so vainly along the"
502,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","forest track for his return, was too much for his affectionate little"
503,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","heart; so, leaning his arms against a tree, he dropped his head upon"
504,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","them and sobbed bitterly.  Then, struggling up, he made another attempt"
505,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","to walk, for he knew he had accomplished more than half the journey, but"
506,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","the injured foot would not support him, and the attempt to stand caused"
507,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",him the sharpest agony.
508,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
509,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","""It is of no use--I _cannot_ stand,"" groaned Jem half-aloud, as,"
510,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","resolving to make the best of circumstances, he sat down, settled his"
511,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","back against a tree, and munched up his hunch of bread.  Then he said"
512,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","his prayers, with the addition of a special one that God would make his"
513,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","dear Mother better without the medicine, and prepared to wait with what"
514,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","patience he might till morning, when he knew that some fur traders or"
515,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","hunters would surely be passing along the track, who would give him the"
516,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",assistance he needed.  One thing Jem was determined about: he would not
517,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",go to sleep.  He set himself to count the stars which peeped through the
518,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","leaves above his head, and listened to the occasional stir of birds and"
519,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",squirrels in their nests.
520,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
521,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","He knew and loved them all, and they on their parts knew that Jem never"

524,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","""It is only Jem,"" they would say when they saw him coming, and they"

526,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
527,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",But somehow Jem did not get very far in his counting of the stars--they
528,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","danced about too much, his head _would_ drop down, and his eyes would"
529,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",_not_ keep open.  It is not easy for a tired little boy of eleven years
530,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","old to keep awake at night, and so in a very few minutes Jem was fast"
531,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",asleep.
532,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",
533,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.",It seemed to him that he had scarcely closed his eyes when a slight

535,"A GRATEFUL INDIAN, BY HELEN MARION BURNSIDE.","for, with a thrill of horror, he became aware of two Indians standing"

666,"MY ENCOUNTER WITH A GRIZZLY, BY ARTHUR J DANIELS.",told me only too plainly of an approaching storm.  Fearful of being

677,"MY ENCOUNTER WITH A GRIZZLY, BY ARTHUR J DANIELS.",and this was followed by a deep significant growl.

696,"MY ENCOUNTER WITH A GRIZZLY, BY ARTHUR J DANIELS.","little distance to the rear, but following with incredible rapidity, an"

811,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
812,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",Little Kirl kept the goats on the mountain.  Little Kirl was very
813,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","little, his legs were very short, his body was very round and chubby,"
814,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",and he could certainly not have overtaken an active and badly-disposed
815,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","goat, whatever had been the consequences.  So it was a fortunate thing"
816,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",that they did not require much herding.  He had only to drive them to
817,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","the pastures on the mountain in the morning, and home again in the"
818,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","evening, and the young ones followed the old ones, round whose necks the"
819,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",tinkling bells were hung.
820,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
821,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","Little Kirl had only begun to keep the goats this summer, and he thought"
822,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",when one has become a real live goat-herd one is in a fair way to become
823,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",a man.  How all the other little boys in the village must envy him--poor
824,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","things, not yet promoted to manhood!  And he had a crooked stick also,"
825,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",and a little pipe on which he could really play several notes; and this
826,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",was the way he went up the mountain.
827,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
828,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","First there were the goats to be driven out of the gate, and what a"
829,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","thing it was to walk after them, playing those three notes with"
830,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","variations, and trying not to look too proud of himself!  It was not a"
831,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","very large village, to be sure, the little cluster of brown chalets and"
832,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",the tiny pink-washed church beside the pine-wood; but to Kirl it was a
833,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",whole world looking on and admiring.  He blew his three notes louder
834,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",with a more and more cheerful trill all down the street.  At the
835,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",cross-roads below the church the greatest caution had to be exercised to
836,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","keep the frisky kids from going the wrong way, but it was worth the"
837,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","trouble.  Only think how well it looked to drive them close together,"
838,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and to fence them off, first on one side and then on the other, with the"
839,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","crooked stick, and then, with an air as if he thought nothing of it,"
840,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","turn them all successfully into the narrow path, and strike up the three"
841,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",notes more gaily than ever!  It was the pride of Kirl's heart to count
842,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","the goats up in a business-like manner, and call them by name, and shout"
843,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","""thou"" to them, as if he were quite hard-hearted, instead of loving them"
844,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",with all his might.
845,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
846,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",There was one goat in particular that was the pride of Kirl's heart; she
847,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","was not more than a kid, and snowy white, with a beautiful little head"
848,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and a bright eye, a credit to any man's herd.  How little Kirl loved"
849,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","her!  He called her Liesl, as if she had been his sister.  The path led"
850,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","upwards first through the pine-woods, with moss a foot deep on either"
851,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","side, where the wood was damp with the dividing arms of the stream, and"
852,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","the moss on the trees hung in solemn grey clusters, like banners"
853,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",swinging from the branches.  And then the path grew steeper and runnels
854,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","of water dripped down the rocks, all covered with ferns and saxifrage."
855,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",Down below on one side lay the rushing stream and the valley where the
856,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","village was, and up above on the other side rose the great mountains,"
857,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",dark with pine-woods about their feet and glittering with snow upon
858,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",their heads.
859,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
860,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","Little Kirl loved the mountains.  He had been born under their shadow,"
861,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",and perhaps it was this that made him wander up them as far as he dared
862,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","go, for they seemed to draw him to them.  Some day--it was such a"
863,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","tremendous thought that little Kirl kept it quite to himself, deep down"
864,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","in his mind--but some day, when he had got beyond even herding the"
865,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","goats, he meant to become a guide."
866,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
867,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",The way up the mountain hitherto for little Kirl ended in the grassy
868,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",pasture where the goats stayed.  Here was a pleasant slope thick with
869,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","globe-flowers and narcissus at the lower end, and fragrant with wild"
870,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","thyme at the upper ridge, where the precipice began."
871,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
872,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",And now this is the story of little Kirl and the goats.  For it was at
873,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","this place one hot day in July, when little Kirl sat clasping his knees"
874,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and looking up at the mountain-tops, that he was suddenly wakened from"
875,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",his dream by seeing Liesl perched on the extreme edge of the precipice.
876,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","It was a spot to which the goats were not allowed to go, for,"
877,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","sure-footed though they were, it was crumbling and unsafe.  And there"
878,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","stood Liesl, the flower of the flock, her pretty snowy figure against"
879,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","the dark-blue sky.  Even as little Kirl leaped up and called her, she"
880,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",threw up her graceful head as if in pride.
881,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
882,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",And then there came the most dreadful thing that had ever happened in
883,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",little Kirl's life.  Exactly how it was he could not afterwards
884,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","remember, but all in a moment Liesl, who could perch herself, as it"
885,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","seemed, on nothing at all, pretty, sure-footed Liesl was over the edge!"
886,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","Little Kirl threw himself down on his face in an agony, and peered over"
887,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","the edge, calling and screaming wildly in his despair, for there was no"
888,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","hope of saving poor Liesl.  But yes, there was!  Down there she had got"
889,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","her fore-foot on a ledge below the brink, and was fighting and"
890,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",scrambling to regain her foothold.  The loose stones were slipping away
891,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","under the pretty tufts of ""student roses"" that grew amongst the shale,"
892,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and poor Liesl was slipping away too, down and down."
893,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
894,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","She was staring up at him with imploring eyes, with a look that seemed"
895,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",to call aloud for help.  But little Kirl had got her.  It was not for
896,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",nothing that little Kirl's eyes were so steady when they looked in your
897,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","face and his face was so square about the chin, however much he smiled."
898,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",Those stout little arms were clinging to neck and leg as if the owner of
899,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",them would be dragged over the ledge himself before he would leave poor
900,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",Liesl to her fate.  Let her go?  No!  _That_ was not the way little Kirl
901,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",kept his charge; _that_ was not the way of men on the mountains.
902,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
903,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","But Liesl was not light, and Kirl was only little, and his breath came"
904,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and went, and his eyes saw nothing, and the world was whirling round,"
905,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","and a great sob burst from him.  And then a big, big voice said: ""Thou"
906,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","little thing!  Thou little, good thing!""  And two big, big arms came"
907,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","downwards and caught little Kirl and Liesl up together into--oh, such"
908,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",blissful safety!  And little Kirl stood clinging to somebody; and what
909,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","happened next he did not know.  Careless, ungrateful Liesl only shook"
910,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","herself and frisked off, with a little squeal of relief, to join the"
911,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",older and wiser goats.
912,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.",
913,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","But little Kirl, when he next knew what he was doing, found that he was"
914,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","crying and sobbing uncontrollably, and big Kirl, the tallest, handsomest"
915,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","man in the village, was patting his shoulders, and soothing and"
916,"UP THE MOUNTAIN, BY FRANCES E CROMPTON.","consoling and praising him.  And yet more--big Kirl, one of the best"

980,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.","together.  We were three years together, then he left, and I have never"
981,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.","seen him again, for his life has been spent in foreign lands.  He was"

983,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.",who used secretly to look up to him and worship him.  But now I must
984,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.",tell you why he became my hero.  One day a party of boys had arranged to
985,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.","walk to a place four miles distant, where there was to be a meet of the"

991,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.","must remember I was a very small boy then, and once, in jumping a ditch,"
992,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.",I gave my ankle a little twist which made it still more difficult to go
993,"GRANDFATHER'S HERO, BY ANON.","along fast.  However, no one noticed me, and I was determined not to be"
