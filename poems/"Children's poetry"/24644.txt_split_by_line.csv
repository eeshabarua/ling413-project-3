2481,THE IDLE BOY.,
2482,THE IDLE BOY.,"There was a little boy; he was not a big boy, for if he had been a big"
2483,THE IDLE BOY.,"boy I suppose he would have been wiser; but this was a little boy, not"
2484,THE IDLE BOY.,"higher than the table, and his papa and mamma sent him to school. It was"
2485,THE IDLE BOY.,"a very pleasant morning; the sun shone, and the birds sung on the trees."
2486,THE IDLE BOY.,"Now this little boy did not much love his book, for he was but a silly"
2487,THE IDLE BOY.,"little boy, as I told you; and he had a great mind to play instead of"
2488,THE IDLE BOY.,going to school. And he saw a [Illustration]
2489,THE IDLE BOY.,
2490,THE IDLE BOY.,"bee flying about, first upon one flower, and then upon another; so he"
2491,THE IDLE BOY.,"said, ""Pretty bee! will you come and play with me?"" But the bee said,"
2492,THE IDLE BOY.,"""No, I must not be idle; I must go and gather honey."" Then the little"
2493,THE IDLE BOY.,"boy met a dog, and he said, ""Dog! will you play with me?"" But the dog"
2494,THE IDLE BOY.,"said, ""No, I must not be idle; I am going to catch a hare for my"

2496,THE IDLE BOY.,"went by a hay-rick, and he saw a bird pulling some hay out of the"
2497,THE IDLE BOY.,"hay-rick, and he said, ""Bird! will you come and play with me?"" But the"
2498,THE IDLE BOY.,"bird said, ""No, I must not be idle; I must get some hay to build my nest"

2500,THE IDLE BOY.,"little boy saw a horse, and he said, ""Horse! will you play with me?"" But"
2501,THE IDLE BOY.,"the horse said, ""No, I must not be idle; I must go and plough, or else"

2538,COUNTRY WALK.,"Early one morning during last summer, Harry and I put on our hats, and"
2539,COUNTRY WALK.,taking some cake in our pockets for lunch set out for a good long walk.
2540,COUNTRY WALK.,"First we went through the Home Meadow, where the tall elm-trees are, and"
2541,COUNTRY WALK.,then through the gate at the bottom of the valley into the corn-fields.
2542,COUNTRY WALK.,"The sun was shining bright and clear, and a lark was singing high up in"
2543,COUNTRY WALK.,the blue sky almost beyond our sight. Harry and I stood still to watch
2544,COUNTRY WALK.,"its descent, and after many minutes we saw it alight near a tuft of"
2545,COUNTRY WALK.,"grass by the hedge-side. We walked a little nearer, and then we found"
2546,COUNTRY WALK.,that there was another bird there with some young ones; so we thought
2547,COUNTRY WALK.,"that this lark had been singing its long, sweet song in the air to"
2548,COUNTRY WALK.,"cheer its mate, who was feeding their little ones in the nest."
2549,COUNTRY WALK.,
2550,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2551,COUNTRY WALK.,
2552,COUNTRY WALK.,"We then walked on, and soon came to the skirts of the wood, through"
2553,COUNTRY WALK.,which runs a little stream. We thought there must be some one in the
2554,COUNTRY WALK.,"wood, for we heard a smart tapping sound, like the noise of a little"
2555,COUNTRY WALK.,"hammer. I climbed on the top of a hedge-bank, and, after a little while,"
2556,COUNTRY WALK.,found that the noise came from over our heads. On the trunk of a tree
2557,COUNTRY WALK.,were two wood-peckers pecking with their long beaks at the bark of a
2558,COUNTRY WALK.,"fir-tree, in which they find a number of little insects, which serve"
2559,COUNTRY WALK.,"them for their food. I lifted Harry up to see them at their work, but he"
2560,COUNTRY WALK.,"did not frighten them, and at some long way off we could still hear them"
2561,COUNTRY WALK.,tapping away.
2562,COUNTRY WALK.,
2563,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2564,COUNTRY WALK.,
2565,COUNTRY WALK.,"Just at the corner of the wood, as we were turning round by the side of"
2566,COUNTRY WALK.,"the fence, we saw two hares and a rabbit feeding among the clover; one"
2567,COUNTRY WALK.,"of them pricked up his ears and looked at us for a moment, and then all"
2568,COUNTRY WALK.,"of them ran away across the field much faster than Harry, who tried all"
2569,COUNTRY WALK.,he could to catch them.
2570,COUNTRY WALK.,
2571,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2572,COUNTRY WALK.,
2573,COUNTRY WALK.,"We had not walked much further when we heard a great chattering, and"
2574,COUNTRY WALK.,"when we came to a young beech-tree close by the stile, we soon found the"
2575,COUNTRY WALK.,cause of the noise. About two dozen or more of a little bird called the
2576,COUNTRY WALK.,"titmouse had all perched on one tree, where they were pecking, and"
2577,COUNTRY WALK.,"fighting, and love-making, and noise-making, all at the same time."
2578,COUNTRY WALK.,Except the noise made by sparrows when they go to bed on a summer's
2579,COUNTRY WALK.,"evening, I never heard the like."
2580,COUNTRY WALK.,
2581,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2582,COUNTRY WALK.,
2583,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2584,COUNTRY WALK.,
2585,COUNTRY WALK.,"While I was amusing myself by watching the titmice, Harry, who had"
2586,COUNTRY WALK.,"rambled on a little way, came running back to ask me what the funny"
2587,COUNTRY WALK.,thing could be that he had found. It was a mole that had been caught in
2588,COUNTRY WALK.,"a trap, and was dangling in the air with a swarm of bees around. I told"
2589,COUNTRY WALK.,"Harry that the moles are blind, or nearly so, and that they live under"
2590,COUNTRY WALK.,"the ground, and do great good to the farmers by eating the slugs and"
2591,COUNTRY WALK.,other things that destroy the corn; but that they turn up such great
2592,COUNTRY WALK.,"mounds of earth when making their tunnels, that the farmers are often"
2593,COUNTRY WALK.,"glad to get rid of them, and therefore set traps to kill them."
2594,COUNTRY WALK.,
2595,COUNTRY WALK.,"In the next field we came to, the young wheat had grown up higher than"
2596,COUNTRY WALK.,"my knees, and Harry was greatly pleased at running down the furrows and"
2597,COUNTRY WALK.,making the blades of corn bend before him. Presently he stopped and
2598,COUNTRY WALK.,"peeped through an opening, whence he discovered a whole covey of"
2599,COUNTRY WALK.,"partridges, the two old birds and seven young ones; they all rose with a"
2600,COUNTRY WALK.,"whirring noise, and flew into the field we had just left."
2601,COUNTRY WALK.,
2602,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2603,COUNTRY WALK.,
2604,COUNTRY WALK.,"Soon after the partridges had flown away, Harry was delighted to hear"
2605,COUNTRY WALK.,the well-known voice of the cuckoo; it sounded so near us that we both
2606,COUNTRY WALK.,"started at the first voice, and we soon found out where the cuckoo was."
2607,COUNTRY WALK.,"Like a lazy tyrant, instead of making a house for himself, the cuckoo"
2608,COUNTRY WALK.,"takes the first little bird's nest he can find, and turns the poor"
2609,COUNTRY WALK.,"occupant away. When we reached the tree where the cuckoo was, we saw it"
2610,COUNTRY WALK.,"sitting on a small nest throwing out the eggs of a poor little bird, who"
2611,COUNTRY WALK.,was screaming in anger at the intruder.
2612,COUNTRY WALK.,
2613,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2614,COUNTRY WALK.,
2615,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2616,COUNTRY WALK.,
2617,COUNTRY WALK.,"When I told Harry what the cuckoo had been doing, he wanted to throw a"
2618,COUNTRY WALK.,"stone at it, but I told him that this cuckoo was only doing what all"
2619,COUNTRY WALK.,"other cuckoos did, and that the poor little bird would soon build itself"
2620,COUNTRY WALK.,"another nest. As we walked on, still by the side of the wood, Harry saw"
2621,COUNTRY WALK.,something jumping about in the boughs of a tree; and presently another
2622,COUNTRY WALK.,"followed it: they were two squirrels, with their long bushy tails curled"
2623,COUNTRY WALK.,"over their backs, and their ears pricked up to hear the slightest noise."
2624,COUNTRY WALK.,"As soon as they saw Harry looking at them they both leaped away, and we"
2625,COUNTRY WALK.,lost them in the branches of a large oak. To look after the squirrels
2626,COUNTRY WALK.,"we had climbed over the hedge, so we were walking a little way in the"
2627,COUNTRY WALK.,wood. Presently I heard the call of a pheasant; and as we walked
2628,COUNTRY WALK.,"further, we came to some brush-wood, under which were two old birds and"
2629,COUNTRY WALK.,their young ones. They all flew away at our approach; but the old
2630,COUNTRY WALK.,"cock-pheasant left two of his tail-feathers in the brush-wood, which"
2631,COUNTRY WALK.,Harry soon picked up to decorate his hat with.
2632,COUNTRY WALK.,
2633,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2634,COUNTRY WALK.,
2635,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2636,COUNTRY WALK.,
2637,COUNTRY WALK.,The next bird that caught our notice was a fly-catcher. It was sitting
2638,COUNTRY WALK.,"on a bramble catching bees and flies, and so intently was it watching"
2639,COUNTRY WALK.,"for them, that it did not even notice our presence, till Harry tried to"
2640,COUNTRY WALK.,"put his hand on it, but then away it flew with a fine chattering."
2641,COUNTRY WALK.,
2642,COUNTRY WALK.,"We now left the wood, and taking the foot-path to the left, went along"
2643,COUNTRY WALK.,"till we came to the road. Just by the stile sat a girl, who had been"
2644,COUNTRY WALK.,"gathering dried sticks in the wood, where her father was cutting down"
2645,COUNTRY WALK.,"trees. She had tied up the sticks into a bundle, and was sitting on them"
2646,COUNTRY WALK.,"to rest herself, because they were so heavy. She asked me to help her to"
2647,COUNTRY WALK.,"put them on her head; this I did, and then she thanked me, and trudged"
2648,COUNTRY WALK.,"on, singing as merrily as a lark in the sky."
2649,COUNTRY WALK.,
2650,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2651,COUNTRY WALK.,
2652,COUNTRY WALK.,Now we came to a bridge over a wide river. I mounted Harry astride the
2653,COUNTRY WALK.,"parapet, and there we stopped for some minutes to look at the boats as"
2654,COUNTRY WALK.,"they passed under us, and to watch two swans which were sailing up the"
2655,COUNTRY WALK.,"river with their great wings spread out for sails, and their necks so"
2656,COUNTRY WALK.,proudly bent that they looked like the king and queen of the river.
2657,COUNTRY WALK.,"Harry would have stayed for hours to look at them, but we could not stop"
2658,COUNTRY WALK.,long.
2659,COUNTRY WALK.,
2660,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2661,COUNTRY WALK.,
2662,COUNTRY WALK.,"We next turned down the pathway by the river-side, and soon we came to"
2663,COUNTRY WALK.,"the wide marshes, which are only two miles off the sea. There we were"
2664,COUNTRY WALK.,"standing under a willow, watching for the fish which were swimming down"
2665,COUNTRY WALK.,"the river in little shoals, when we heard a splash on the opposite bank;"
2666,COUNTRY WALK.,"it was an otter that had dived into the river, and caught a fish, with"
2667,COUNTRY WALK.,which we saw it climb on to the bank again. Men used to hunt the otter
2668,COUNTRY WALK.,with dogs and spears; and sometimes otters have been trained to catch
2669,COUNTRY WALK.,"fish and bring them to land, but we do not often find them in England."
2670,COUNTRY WALK.,
2671,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2672,COUNTRY WALK.,
2673,COUNTRY WALK.,"As we walked on by the river-side, we noticed a hawk flying swiftly over"
2674,COUNTRY WALK.,"us; afterwards we saw him balance himself on his wings, and keep for"
2675,COUNTRY WALK.,"many minutes in exactly the same place. Presently, with a loud scream,"
2676,COUNTRY WALK.,"he darted down into some rushes a little way before us, and then we"
2677,COUNTRY WALK.,"heard a most furious quacking, as if there were fifty ducks there. We"
2678,COUNTRY WALK.,"ran on and saw a drake flying at the hawk and pecking at its wings, and"
2679,COUNTRY WALK.,"the duck, quacking in the utmost alarm, tried to get all her little"
2680,COUNTRY WALK.,"ducklings under her wings; but, alas! one little truant ran into the"
2681,COUNTRY WALK.,"weeds, and the hawk caught it in his claws, and, in spite of all the"
2682,COUNTRY WALK.,"efforts of the poor drake, flew away with it."
2683,COUNTRY WALK.,
2684,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2685,COUNTRY WALK.,
2686,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2687,COUNTRY WALK.,
2688,COUNTRY WALK.,"Harry was greatly excited at this scene, and cried to see the hawk carry"
2689,COUNTRY WALK.,"away the poor little duck; but he soon laughed again, for as he watched"
2690,COUNTRY WALK.,"the robber in his flight through the air, he saw a number of little"
2691,COUNTRY WALK.,"birds fly after him,--sparrows, swallows, finches, all chirping at him"
2692,COUNTRY WALK.,"and mocking him; then a tribe of bigger birds, blackbirds, magpies,"
2693,COUNTRY WALK.,"rooks, and jays, flew after him also; and as the hawk could not fly fast"
2694,COUNTRY WALK.,"with the duckling in his claws, they soon overtook him, and we saw them"
2695,COUNTRY WALK.,"peck at his wings and his tail, and pull his feathers out; and they all"
2696,COUNTRY WALK.,screamed and chattered at him till at last the hawk let the poor
2697,COUNTRY WALK.,"duckling down into the marsh, and then, rising much higher than the"
2698,COUNTRY WALK.,"other birds, flew away so quickly that he was out of sight in a minute."
2699,COUNTRY WALK.,"Harry clapped his hands with delight to see the hawk thus treated, and"
2700,COUNTRY WALK.,said that he was rightly served.
2701,COUNTRY WALK.,
2702,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2703,COUNTRY WALK.,
2704,COUNTRY WALK.,Now we walked on again by the river-side. The swallows skimmed along
2705,COUNTRY WALK.,"the surface of the water, and caught the insects that hovered over it,"
2706,COUNTRY WALK.,"and now and then a sea-gull came with its great wings, and diving into"
2707,COUNTRY WALK.,"the river, bore away a poor fish in its beak to swallow at its leisure."
2708,COUNTRY WALK.,
2709,COUNTRY WALK.,[Illustration]
2710,COUNTRY WALK.,
2711,COUNTRY WALK.,"Then we came close to a solemn-looking heron, who stood so still that"
2712,COUNTRY WALK.,"we could hardly tell if he were alive, till we saw him suddenly dive his"
2713,COUNTRY WALK.,"head in a pool of water and pull out a frog, which he swallowed at one"
2714,COUNTRY WALK.,mouthful; and then he stood as still and solemn as ever. He flew away
2715,COUNTRY WALK.,"when we walked near him, flapping his immense wings slowly, and giving a"
2716,COUNTRY WALK.,mournful cry.
2717,COUNTRY WALK.,
2718,COUNTRY WALK.,"Then we turned away from the river, and took a path across the meadows,"
2719,COUNTRY WALK.,where Harry ran about and gathered cowslips and buttercups until he was
2720,COUNTRY WALK.,quite tired; therefore it happened very luckily that just as we reached
2721,COUNTRY WALK.,"the gate into the high-road, who should we see but Uncle George driving"
2722,COUNTRY WALK.,"past in his gig! He stopped his horse when he saw us, and both Harry and"
2723,COUNTRY WALK.,I were very glad to have a nice ride home with him.
2724,COUNTRY WALK.,
2725,COUNTRY WALK.,"In the evening Harry and I went for a stroll in the fields near home,"
2726,COUNTRY WALK.,and presently we came to one where the sheep were feeding. The shepherd
2727,COUNTRY WALK.,"was just calling them home to be put in the fold, and we were very much"
2728,COUNTRY WALK.,amused to see the antics of some of the young lambs that would skip
2729,COUNTRY WALK.,about instead of going to bed with their mothers. This put me in mind to
2730,COUNTRY WALK.,tell Harry Mrs. Barbauld's story about
2731,COUNTRY WALK.,
2732,COUNTRY WALK.,
2733,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.
2734,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,
2735,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"There was once a shepherd, who had a great many sheep and lambs. He took"
2736,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"a great deal of care of them, and gave them sweet fresh grass to eat,"
2737,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,and clear water to drink; and if they were sick he was very good to
2738,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"them; and when they climbed up a steep hill, and the lambs were tired,"
2739,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,he used to carry them in his arms; and when they were all eating their
2740,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"suppers in the field, he used to sit upon a stile, and play them a"
2741,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"tune, and sing to them. And so they were the happiest sheep and lambs in"
2742,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,the whole world. But every night this shepherd used to pen them up in a
2743,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"fold. Do you know what a sheepfold is? Well, I will tell you. It is a"
2744,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"place like the court; but instead of pales there are hurdles, which are"
2745,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"made of sticks that will bend, such as osier twigs; and they are twisted"
2746,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"and made very fast, so that nothing can creep in, and nothing can get"
2747,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"out. Well, and so every night, when it grew dark and cold, the shepherd"
2748,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"called all his flock, sheep and lambs, together, and drove them into the"
2749,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"fold, and penned them up, and there they lay as snug and warm and"
2750,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"comfortable as could be, and nothing could get in to hurt them, and the"
2751,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"dogs lay round on the outside to guard them, and to bark if any body"
2752,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"came near; and in the morning the shepherd unpenned the fold, and let"
2753,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,them all out again.
2754,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,
2755,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,[Illustration]
2756,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,
2757,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"Now they were all very happy, as I told you, and loved the shepherd"
2758,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,dearly that was so good to them--all except one foolish little lamb. And
2759,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,this lamb did not like to be shut up every night in the fold; and she
2760,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"came to her mother, who was a wise old sheep, and said to her, ""I wonder"
2761,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"why we are shut up so every night? the dogs are not shut up, and why"
2762,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"should we be shut up? I think it is very hard, and I will get away if I"
2763,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"can, I am resolved; for I like to run about where I please, and I think"
2764,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"it is very pleasant in the woods by moonlight."" Then the old sheep"
2765,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"said to her, ""You are very silly, you little lamb, you had better stay"
2766,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"in the fold. The shepherd is so good to us, that we should always do as"
2767,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"he bids us; and if you wander about by yourself, I dare say you will"
2768,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"come to some harm."" ""I dare say not,"" said the little lamb. And so when"
2769,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"the evening came, and the shepherd called them all to come into the"
2770,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"fold, she would not come, but crept slily under a hedge and hid herself;"
2771,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"and when the rest of the lambs were all in the fold and fast asleep,"
2772,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"she came out, and jumped, and frisked, and danced about; and she got out"
2773,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"of the field, and got into a forest full of trees, and a very fierce"
2774,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,wolf came rushing out of a cave and howled very loud. Then the silly
2775,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"lamb wished she had been shut up in the fold, but the fold was a great"
2776,THE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.,"way off. And the wolf saw her and seized her, and carried her away to a"
