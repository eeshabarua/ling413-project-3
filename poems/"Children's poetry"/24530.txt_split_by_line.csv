150,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,THE GOLD-SPINNER.
151,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
152,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
153,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"A miller had a daughter,"
154,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And lovely, too, she was;"
155,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Her step was light, her smile was bright,"
156,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Her eyes were gray as glass.
157,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,(So Chaucer loved to write of eyes
158,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,In which that nameless azure lies
159,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"So like shoal-water in its hue,"
160,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Though all too crystal clear for blue.)
161,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"As you would suppose, the miller"
162,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Was very proud of her,"
163,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And would never fail to tell some tale
164,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,As to what her graces were.
165,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,On the powdery air of his own mill
166,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Floated the whispers of her skill;
167,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,At the village inn the loungers knew
168,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,All that the pretty girl could do.
169,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
170,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Oft in his braggart way
171,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"This foolish tale he told,"
172,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That his daughter could spin from bits of straw
173,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Continuous threads of gold!
174,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"So boastful had he grown, forsooth,"
175,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That he cared but little for the truth:
176,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But since this was a curious thing
177,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,It came to the knowledge of the king.
178,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
179,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He thought it an old wife's fable,"
180,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But senseless stuff at best;
181,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Yet, as he had greed, he cried, ""Indeed!"
182,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"I will put her powers to test."""
183,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"With a wave of his hand, he further said"
184,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That to-morrow morning the clever maid
185,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Should come to the castle, and he would see"
186,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,What truth in the story there might be.
187,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
188,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Next day, with a trembling step,"
189,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She reached the palace door,"
190,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And was shown into a chamber, where"
191,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Was straw upon the floor.
192,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"They brought her a chair and a spinning-wheel,"
193,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"A little can of oil, and a reel;"
194,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And said that unless the work was done--
195,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,All of the straw into the gold-thread spun--
196,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,By the time that the sun was an hour high
197,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Next morning, she would have to die."
198,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
199,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Down sat she in despair,"
200,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Her tears falling like rain:
201,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She had never spun a thread in her life,"
202,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Nor ever reeled a skein!
203,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Hark! the door creaked, and through a chink,"
204,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"With droll wise smile and funny wink,"
205,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"In stepped a little quaint old man,"
206,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"All humped, and crooked, and browned with tan."
207,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
208,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,She looked in fear and amaze
209,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,To see what he would do;
210,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He said, ""Little maid, what will you give"
211,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"If I'll spin the straw for you?"""
212,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Ah, me, few gifts she had in store--"
213,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"A trinket or two, and nothing more!"
214,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,A necklace from her throat so slim
215,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She took, and timidly offered him."
216,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
217,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"'Twas enough, it seemed; for he sat"
218,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"At the wheel in front of her,"
219,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And turned it three times round and round,"
220,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Whirr, and whirr-rr, and whirr-rr-rr--"
221,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"One of the bobbins was full; and then,"
222,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Whirr, and whirr-rr, and whirr-rr-rr again,"
223,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Until all the straw that had been spread
224,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Had been deftly spun into golden thread.
225,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
226,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,At sunrise came the king
227,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"To the chamber, and, behold,"
228,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Instead of the ugly heaps of straw
229,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Were bobbins full of gold!
230,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,This made him greedier than before;
231,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And he led the maiden out at the door
232,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Into a new room, where she saw"
233,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Still larger and larger heaps of straw,"
234,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"A chair to sit in, a spinning-wheel,"
235,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"A little can of oil, and a reel;"
236,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And he said that straw, too, must be spun"
237,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,To gold before the next day's sun
238,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Was an hour high in the morning sky,"
239,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And if 'twas not done, she must die."
240,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
241,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Down sank she in despair,"
242,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Her tears falling like rain;
243,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She could not spin a single thread,"
244,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,She could not reel a skein.
245,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"But the door swung back, and through the chink,"
246,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"With the same droll smile and merry wink,"
247,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The dwarf peered, saying, ""What will you do"
248,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"If I'll spin the straw once more for you?"""
249,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""Ah me, I can give not a single thing,"""
250,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She cried, ""except my finger-ring."""
251,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He took the slender toy,"
252,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And slipped it over his thumb;
253,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Then down he sat and whirled the wheel,"
254,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Hum, and hum-m, and hum-m-m;"
255,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Round and round with a droning sound,"
256,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Many a yellow spool he wound,"
257,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Many a glistening skein he reeled;
258,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And still, like bees in a clover-field,"
259,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The wheel went hum, and hum-m and hum-m-m."
260,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Next morning the king came,"
261,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Almost before sunrise,"
262,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"To the chamber where the maiden was,"
263,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And could scarce believe his eyes
264,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"To see the straw, to the smallest shreds,"
265,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Made into shining amber threads.
266,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And he cried, ""When once more I have tried"
267,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Your skill like this, you shall be my bride;"
268,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
269,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,For I might search through all my life
270,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Nor find elsewhere so rich a wife."""
271,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Then he led her by the hand
272,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Through still another door,"
273,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,To a room filled twice as full of straw
274,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,As either had been before.
275,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"There stood the chair and the spinning-wheel,"
276,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And there the can of oil and the reel;
277,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And as he gently shut her in
278,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He whispered, ""Spin, little maiden, spin."""
279,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
280,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Again she wept, and again"
281,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Did the little dwarf appear;
282,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""What will you give this time,"" he asked,"
283,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""If I spin for you, my dear?"""
284,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
285,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Alas--poor little maid--alas!
286,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Out of her eyes as gray as glass
287,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Faster and faster tears did fall,"
288,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"As she moaned, ""I've nothing to give at all."""
289,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Ah, wicked indeed he looked;"
290,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"But while she sighed, he smiled!"
291,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""Promise, when you are queen,"" he said,"
292,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""To give me your first-born child!"""
293,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Little she tho't what that might mean,"
294,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Or if ever in truth she should be queen
295,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Anything, so that the work was done--"
296,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Anything, so that the gold was spun!"
297,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,She promised all that he chose to ask;
298,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And blithely he began the task.
299,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
300,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Round went the wheel, and round,"
301,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Whiz, and whiz-z, and whiz-z-z!"
302,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,So swift that the thread at the spindle point
303,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Flew off with buzz and hiss.
304,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
305,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,She dozed--so tired her eyelids were--
306,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"To the endless whirr, and whirr, and whirr;"
307,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Though not even sleep could overcome
308,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The wheel's revolving hum, hum, hum!"
309,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"When at last she woke the room was clean,"
310,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Not a broken bit of straw was seen;
311,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But in huge high heaps were piled and rolled
312,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Great spools of gold--nothing but gold!
313,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"It was just at the earliest peep of dawn,"
314,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And she was alone--the dwarf was gone.
315,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
316,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,It was indeed a marvellous thing
317,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,For a miller's daughter to wed a king;
318,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But never was royal lady seen
319,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,More fair and sweet than this young queen.
320,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,The spinning dwarf she quite forgot
321,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,In the ease and pleasure of her lot;
322,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And not until her first-born child
323,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Into her face had looked and smiled
324,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Did she remember the promise made;
325,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Then her heart grew sick, her soul afraid."
326,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
327,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,One day her chamber door
328,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Pushed open just a chink,"
329,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And she saw the well-known crooked dwarf,"
330,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,His wise smile and his blink.
331,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,He claimed at once the promised child;
332,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But she gave a cry so sad and wild
333,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That even his heart was touched to hear;
334,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And, after a little, drawing near,"
335,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
336,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He whispered and said: ""You pledged"
337,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The baby, and I came;"
338,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But if in three days you can learn
339,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,By foul or fair my name--
340,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"By foul or fair, by wile or snare,"
341,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"You can its syllables declare,"
342,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,Then is the child yours--only then--
343,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And me you shall never see again!"""
344,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
345,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He vanished from her sight,"
346,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And she called her pages in;
347,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She sent one this way, and one that;"
348,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"She called her kith and kin,"
349,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Bade one go here, and one go there,"
350,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Despatched them thither, everywhere--"
351,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That from each quarter each might bring
352,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,The oddest names he could to the king.
353,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
354,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Next morning the dwarf appeared,"
355,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And the queen began to say,"
356,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""Caspar,"" ""Balthassar,"" ""Melchoir""--"
357,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"But the dwarf cried out, ""Nay, nay!"""
358,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Shaking his little crooked frame,"
359,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""That's not my name, that's not my name!"""
360,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
361,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,The second day 'twas the same;
362,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,But the third a messenger
363,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Came in from the mountains to the queen,"
364,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And told this tale to her:
365,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"That, riding under the forest boughs,"
366,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He came to a tiny, curious house;"
367,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Before it a feeble fire burned wan,"
368,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And about the fire was a little man;
369,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"In and out the brands among,"
370,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"Dancing upon one leg, he sung:"
371,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""_To-day I'll stew, and then I'll bake,"
372,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,To-morrow I shall the queen's child take;
373,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"How fine that none is the secret in,"
374,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"That my name is Rumpelstiltskin!_"""
375,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
376,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The queen was overjoyed,"
377,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And when, due time next day,"
378,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"The dwarf returned for the final word,"
379,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,She made great haste to say:
380,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
381,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""Is it Conrade?"" ""No,""--he shook his head."
382,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""Is it Hans? or Hal?"" Still ""No,"" he said."
383,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""_Is it Rumpelstiltskin?_"" then she cried."
384,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"""A witch has told you,"" he replied,"
385,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And shrieked and stamped his foot so hard
386,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That the very marble floor was jarred;
387,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And his leg broke off above the knee,"
388,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"And he hopped off, howling terribly."
389,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
390,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"He vanished then and there,"
391,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And never more was seen!
392,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,This much was in _his_ dreadful name--
393,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,It saved her child to the queen.
394,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And the little lady grew to be
395,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,"So very sweet, so fair to see,"
396,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,That none could her loveliness surpass;
397,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,And her eyes--they were as gray as glass!
398,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
399,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
400,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
401,THE GOLD-SPINNER.,
402,A FISH STORY.,A FISH STORY.
403,A FISH STORY.,
404,A FISH STORY.,
405,A FISH STORY.,"Sir Arthur, the sinner,"
406,A FISH STORY.,"Ate twelve fish for dinner,"
407,A FISH STORY.,And you may believe it's just as I say!
408,A FISH STORY.,"For if you but knew it,"
409,A FISH STORY.,"'Twas I saw him do it,"
410,A FISH STORY.,"And just as it happened, sir, this was the way:"
411,A FISH STORY.,One day this tall fish
412,A FISH STORY.,Swallowed this small fish
413,A FISH STORY.,(_He_ had just eaten a smaller one still);
414,A FISH STORY.,Up came this queer one
415,A FISH STORY.,And gobbled that 'ere one--
416,A FISH STORY.,Didn't he show the most magical skill?
417,A FISH STORY.,Then came this other
418,A FISH STORY.,"And chewed up his brother,"
419,A FISH STORY.,"Made but one gulp, and behold he was through!"
420,A FISH STORY.,He was a gold fish
421,A FISH STORY.,Oh! he was a bold fish--
422,A FISH STORY.,But before he could wink he was eaten up too!
423,A FISH STORY.,"Up came a flounder,"
424,A FISH STORY.,"He was a ten-pounder,"
425,A FISH STORY.,"Opened his mouth, swallowed _him_ and was gone;"
426,A FISH STORY.,"Before you could blink, sir,"
427,A FISH STORY.,"Before he could shrink, sir,"
428,A FISH STORY.,This fish came by and the flounder was gone!
429,A FISH STORY.,"(Alas for my story,"
430,A FISH STORY.,'Tis getting quite gory!
431,A FISH STORY.,So many swallows a summer might make.)
432,A FISH STORY.,"_This_ one came smiling,"
433,A FISH STORY.,"And, sweetly beguiling,"
434,A FISH STORY.,Gobbled the last like a piece of hot cake;
435,A FISH STORY.,A cod followed after;
436,A FISH STORY.,'Twould move you to laughter
437,A FISH STORY.,"To see in his turn how this hake came up,"
438,A FISH STORY.,"Swallowed that cod, sir,"
439,A FISH STORY.,"As if he were scrod, sir,"
440,A FISH STORY.,And then went by in a kind of a huff!
441,A FISH STORY.,"Last, but not least,"

458,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
459,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"'Twas a good little lady fairy,"
460,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Who saddled her wee white mouse,"
461,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"And rode away to the village,"
462,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Long miles from her snug, wee house;"
463,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"She tied her steed to a flower stalk airy,"
464,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,And left him there--this most careless fairy!
465,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
466,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,In Fairyland no dreadful pussies
467,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Do prowl, and do growl and slay--"
468,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"In Fairyland the mice have honor,"
469,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,And draw the queen's carriage gay;
470,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,And the little lady ne'er thought of danger
471,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Because on the fence sat a green-eyed stranger,"
472,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
473,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,But hurried away in a twinkling
474,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Down a dark and gloomy street,"
475,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,Where daily the charm of her presence
476,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,Made the children's dreams more sweet;
477,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,Then Pussy Cat sprang as quick as magic!
478,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,One squeal (as I've heard the story tragic)
479,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
480,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"And down his throat went steed and saddle,"
481,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"So swiftly; and O, dear me!"
482,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"'Stead of her gallant mouse, the lady"
483,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Discovered, where he should be,"
484,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"A monster with blood on his whiskers showing,"
485,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,And dreadful looks in his eyes so knowing!
486,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
487,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Back to Fairyland she must walk, then;"
488,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,In winter no butterfly
489,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Is sailing that way, nor a rose-leaf,"
490,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,For fairies to travel by;
491,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"She reached there at length, but with feet aching"
492,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,And her little heart with fear most breaking.
493,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,
494,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"And the dreadful story, spreading"
495,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"Through Elfland circles, may be"
496,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,The reason why never a fairy
497,PUSSY CAT'S DOING.,"In these later years we see,"

521,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Weather is cold; and snow and sleet

525,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"That's why she sits,"
526,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And knits, and knits."
527,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
528,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"If by any chance she drops her ball,"
529,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And if one of them chases it at all,"
530,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,She peeps out over her glasses' rim
531,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"With a savage, dreadful scowl at him,"
532,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And cries out, ""Scat,"
533,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"You saucy cat!"""
534,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
535,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Or, if her long tail gets uncurled"

539,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"_Somebody_ hears,"
540,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,A loud boxed ears!
541,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
542,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"With them 'tis hurry-scurry and play,"
543,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Or sleep in a round coil half the day;

545,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And the mittens grow, and grow, and grow,"
546,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,So shapely and fast--
547,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,They are done at last!
548,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
549,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,She summons the kittens; each one stands
550,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,While the mittens are tried on his clumsy hands;
551,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Then her glasses drop to the end of her nose,"
552,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And her wits go wandering off in a doze,"
553,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And as never before,"
554,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Does old Puss snore!
555,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
556,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,She is off to that dream-land paradise
557,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Of cats, where cupboards are full of mice;"
558,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Where white and sweet and big as the sea
559,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Are the saucers of warm new milk--ah me,"
560,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,There is no cream
561,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Like that in a dream!
562,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
563,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,There the ways of things are very absurd;
564,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"For a bobolink, or a yellow bird,"
565,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Comes of its own accord, and sits"
566,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"On every knitting-needle that knits,"
567,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And pipes and sings,"
568,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,As the rocker swings.
569,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
570,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Suddenly there is a noise of feet--
571,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Rattle and clatter and patter and beat!
572,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Old Puss makes a flying leap from her chair,"
573,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"With a half-awake and startled stare,"
574,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Striving to see
575,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,What it may be.
576,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
577,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Helter-skelter the kittens appear;
578,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Oh mother dear, we very much fear"
579,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"That we have lost our mittens!"" they cry."
580,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""You have? Then you shall have no pie!"
581,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Lost your mittens?
582,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"You naughty kittens!"""
583,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
584,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Old mother Puss is dreadfully cross,"
585,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"At the spoiled dream first, then at the loss;"
586,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,And with floods of tears down either cheek
587,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Each frightened kitten tries to speak:
588,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Miew, miew, miew!"
589,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Miew, miew, miew!"""
590,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
591,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,A smart cuff over their little brains
592,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Is the only answer the mother deigns
593,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Not another word from one of you!"""
594,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"It means, so without more ado,"
595,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Ashamed and slow
596,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Away they go.
597,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
598,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Again she settles herself and sleeps;
599,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"This time she dreams that she crouches and creeps,"
600,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"A great gray tiger along the grass,"
601,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"While herds of soft-eyed antelopes pass,"
602,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"When--patter, patter!"
603,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Now what's the matter?"""
604,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
605,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Again, with a scramble, the three appear;"
606,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Oh mammy dear, see here, see here,"
607,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"We have found our mittens--see!"" they cry."
608,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""You have? Then you shall have some pie!"
609,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Found your mittens?
610,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"You nice, nice kittens!"""
611,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
612,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,She goes to the oven; there is a pie;
613,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,She sets it out on the floor close by;
614,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"'Tis smoking hot, and covered with juice;"
615,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And she says to them, ""Eat as much as you choose."""
616,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"So up to the chin,"
617,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,They all dip in.
618,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
619,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Dame Puss goes out to wash her paws,"
620,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And to comb her whiskers with her claws,"
621,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,When again the troublesome three appear;
622,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Oh mother dear, see here--see here!"""
623,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Distressed and shy
624,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,They begin to cry.
625,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
626,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,No wonder they cry; they did not wait
627,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"For a spoon, or knife, or fork, or plate,"
628,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"But ate with their fingers! ah, how soiled!"
629,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Dame Puss declares the mittens are spoiled!
630,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Miew, miew, miew,"
631,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Miew, miew, miew!"""
632,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
633,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Then all run out to the rain-water tub,"
634,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Dip in their mittens, and rub, and rub;"
635,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Their little knuckles are fairly bare,"
636,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"And wet, as if drowned, is every hair--"
637,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"Still, over the tub,"
638,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"They rub, rub, rub!"
639,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,
640,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,Once more they haste to their mother dear;
641,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""Oh mammy dear, see here, see here,"
642,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"We've washed our mittens clean!"" they cry."
643,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"""You darling kittens,"
644,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"To wash your mittens,"""
645,THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS.,"She says, and fondles them till they're dry--"

1256,CINDERELLA.,"One day they got a note, a pink,"
1257,CINDERELLA.,"Sweet-scented, crested one,"
1258,CINDERELLA.,Which was an invitation
1259,CINDERELLA.,"To a ball, from the king's son."
1260,CINDERELLA.,"Oh, then poor Cinderella"
1261,CINDERELLA.,"Had to starch, and iron, and plait,"
1262,CINDERELLA.,"And run of errands, frill and crimp,"
1263,CINDERELLA.,"And ruffle, early and late."
1264,CINDERELLA.,
1265,CINDERELLA.,"And when the ball-night came at last,"
1266,CINDERELLA.,"She helped to paint their faces,"
1267,CINDERELLA.,"To lace their satin shoes, and deck"
1268,CINDERELLA.,Them up with flowers and laces;
1269,CINDERELLA.,Then watched their coach roll grandly
1270,CINDERELLA.,"Out of sight; and, after that,"
1271,CINDERELLA.,"She sat down by the chimney,"
1272,CINDERELLA.,"In the cinders, with the cat,"
1273,CINDERELLA.,
1274,CINDERELLA.,And sobbed as if her heart would break.
1275,CINDERELLA.,"Hot tears were on her lashes,"
1276,CINDERELLA.,"Her little hands got black with soot,"
1277,CINDERELLA.,"Her feet begrimed with ashes,"
1278,CINDERELLA.,"When right before her, on the hearth,"
1279,CINDERELLA.,"She knew not how nor why,"
1280,CINDERELLA.,"A little odd old woman stood,"
1281,CINDERELLA.,"And said, ""Why do you cry?"""
1282,CINDERELLA.,
1283,CINDERELLA.,"""It is so very lonely here,"""
1284,CINDERELLA.,"Poor Cinderella said,"
1285,CINDERELLA.,And sobbed again. The little odd
1286,CINDERELLA.,"Old woman bobbed her head,"
1287,CINDERELLA.,"And laughed a merry kind of laugh,"
1288,CINDERELLA.,"And whispered, ""Is that all?"
1289,CINDERELLA.,Wouldn't my little Cinderella
1290,CINDERELLA.,Like to go to the ball?
1291,CINDERELLA.,
1292,CINDERELLA.,"""Run to the garden, then, and fetch"
1293,CINDERELLA.,"A pumpkin, large and nice;"
1294,CINDERELLA.,"Go to the pantry shelf, and from"
1295,CINDERELLA.,The mouse-traps get the mice;
1296,CINDERELLA.,Rats you will find in the rat-trap;
1297,CINDERELLA.,"And, from the watering-pot,"
1298,CINDERELLA.,"Or from under the big, flat garden stone,"
1299,CINDERELLA.,"Six lizards must be got."""
1300,CINDERELLA.,
1301,CINDERELLA.,Nimble as crickets in the grass
1302,CINDERELLA.,"She ran, till it was done,"
1303,CINDERELLA.,And then God-mother stretched her wand
1304,CINDERELLA.,And touched them every one.
1305,CINDERELLA.,"The pumpkin changed into a coach,"
1306,CINDERELLA.,"Which glittered as it rolled,"
1307,CINDERELLA.,"And the mice became six horses,"
1308,CINDERELLA.,With harnesses of gold.
1309,CINDERELLA.,
1310,CINDERELLA.,"One rat a herald was, to blow"
1311,CINDERELLA.,"A trumpet in advance,"
1312,CINDERELLA.,And the first blast that he sounded
1313,CINDERELLA.,Made the horses plunge and prance;
1314,CINDERELLA.,"And the lizards were made footmen,"
1315,CINDERELLA.,Because they were so spry;
1316,CINDERELLA.,And the old rat-coachman on the box
1317,CINDERELLA.,Wore jeweled livery.
1318,CINDERELLA.,
1319,CINDERELLA.,And then on Cinderella's dress
1320,CINDERELLA.,"The magic wand was laid,"
1321,CINDERELLA.,And straight the dingy gown became
1322,CINDERELLA.,A glistening gold brocade.
1323,CINDERELLA.,The gems that shone upon her fingers
1324,CINDERELLA.,Nothing could surpass;
1325,CINDERELLA.,And on her dainty little feet
1326,CINDERELLA.,Were slippers made of glass.
1327,CINDERELLA.,
1328,CINDERELLA.,"""Be sure you get back here, my dear,"
1329,CINDERELLA.,"At twelve o'clock at night,"""
1330,CINDERELLA.,"Godmother said, and in a twinkling"
1331,CINDERELLA.,She was out of sight.
1332,CINDERELLA.,"When Cinderella reached the ball,"
1333,CINDERELLA.,"And entered at the door,"
1334,CINDERELLA.,So beautiful a lady
1335,CINDERELLA.,None had ever seen before.
1336,CINDERELLA.,
1337,CINDERELLA.,The Prince his admiration showed
1338,CINDERELLA.,In every word and glance;
1339,CINDERELLA.,"He led her out to supper,"
1340,CINDERELLA.,And he chose her for the dance;
1341,CINDERELLA.,But she kept in mind the warning
1342,CINDERELLA.,"That her Godmother had given,"
1343,CINDERELLA.,"And left the ball, with all its charm."
1344,CINDERELLA.,At just half after eleven.
1345,CINDERELLA.,
1346,CINDERELLA.,Next night there was another ball;
1347,CINDERELLA.,She helped her sisters twain
1348,CINDERELLA.,"To pinch their waists, and curl their hair,"
1349,CINDERELLA.,And paint their cheeks again.
1350,CINDERELLA.,"Then came the fairy Godmother,"
1351,CINDERELLA.,"And, with her wand, once more"
1352,CINDERELLA.,Arrayed her out in greater splendor
1353,CINDERELLA.,Even than before.
1354,CINDERELLA.,
1355,CINDERELLA.,"The coach and six, with gay outriders,"
1356,CINDERELLA.,"Bore her through the street,"
1357,CINDERELLA.,"And a crowd was gathered round to look,"
1358,CINDERELLA.,"The lady was so sweet,--"
1359,CINDERELLA.,"So light of heart, and face, and mien,"
1360,CINDERELLA.,As happy children are;
1361,CINDERELLA.,"And when her foot stepped down,"
1362,CINDERELLA.,Her slipper twinkled like a star.
1363,CINDERELLA.,
1364,CINDERELLA.,Again the Prince chose only her
1365,CINDERELLA.,For waltz or _tete-a-tete_;
1366,CINDERELLA.,So swift the minutes flew she did not
1367,CINDERELLA.,"Dream it could be late,"
1368,CINDERELLA.,"But all at once, remembering"
1369,CINDERELLA.,"What her Godmother had said,"
1370,CINDERELLA.,And hearing twelve begin to strike
1371,CINDERELLA.,"Upon the clock, she fled."
1372,CINDERELLA.,
1373,CINDERELLA.,Swift as a swallow on the wing
1374,CINDERELLA.,"She darted, but, alas!"
1375,CINDERELLA.,Dropped from one flying foot the tiny
1376,CINDERELLA.,Slipper made of glass;
1377,CINDERELLA.,"But she got away, and well it was"
1378,CINDERELLA.,"She did, for in a trice"
1379,CINDERELLA.,"Her coach changed to a pumpkin,"
1380,CINDERELLA.,And her horses became mice;
1381,CINDERELLA.,
1382,CINDERELLA.,And back into the cinder dress
1383,CINDERELLA.,Was changed the gold brocade!
1384,CINDERELLA.,"The prince secured the slipper,"
1385,CINDERELLA.,And this proclamation made:
1386,CINDERELLA.,"That the country should be searched,"
1387,CINDERELLA.,"And any lady, far or wide,"
1388,CINDERELLA.,"Who could get the slipper on her foot,"
1389,CINDERELLA.,Should straightway be his bride.
1390,CINDERELLA.,
1391,CINDERELLA.,"So every lady tried it,"
1392,CINDERELLA.,"With her ""Mys!"" and ""Ahs!"" and ""Ohs!"""
1393,CINDERELLA.,And Cinderella's sisters pared
1394,CINDERELLA.,"Their heels, and pared their toes,--"
1395,CINDERELLA.,But all in vain! Nobody's foot
1396,CINDERELLA.,"Was small enough for it,"
1397,CINDERELLA.,"Till Cinderella tried it,"
1398,CINDERELLA.,And it was a perfect fit.
1399,CINDERELLA.,
1400,CINDERELLA.,Then the royal heralds hardly
1401,CINDERELLA.,"Knew what it was best to do,"
1402,CINDERELLA.,When from out her tattered pocket
1403,CINDERELLA.,"Forth she drew the other shoe,"
1404,CINDERELLA.,While the eyelids on the larkspur eyes
1405,CINDERELLA.,"Dropped down a snowy vail,"
1406,CINDERELLA.,"And the sisters turned from pale to red,"
1407,CINDERELLA.,"And then from red to pale,"
1408,CINDERELLA.,
1409,CINDERELLA.,"And in hateful anger cried, and stormed,"
1410,CINDERELLA.,"And scolded, and all that,"
1411,CINDERELLA.,"And a courtier, without thinking,"
1412,CINDERELLA.,Tittered out behind his hat.
1413,CINDERELLA.,For here was all the evidence
1414,CINDERELLA.,"The Prince had asked, complete,"
1415,CINDERELLA.,"Two little slippers made of glass,"
1416,CINDERELLA.,Fitting two little feet.
1417,CINDERELLA.,
1418,CINDERELLA.,"So the Prince, with all his retinue,"
1419,CINDERELLA.,Came there to claim his wife;
1420,CINDERELLA.,And he promised he would love her
1421,CINDERELLA.,With devotion all his life.
1422,CINDERELLA.,At the marriage there was splendid
1423,CINDERELLA.,"Music, dancing, wedding cake;"
1424,CINDERELLA.,And he kept the slipper as a treasure
1425,CINDERELLA.,"Ever, for her sake."

1435,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Dick, as a little lad, was told"
1436,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,That the London streets were paved with gold.
1437,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"He never, in all his life, had seen"
1438,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,A place more grand than the village green;

1440,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Pictured this city of delight,"
1441,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Till whatever he did, wherever he went,"
1442,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,His mind was filled with discontent.
1443,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1444,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"There was bitter taste to the peasant bread,"
1445,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And a restless hardness to his bed;
1446,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"So, after a while, one summer day,"
1447,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Little Dick Whittington ran away.
1448,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Yes--ran away to London city!
1449,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Poor little lad! he needs your pity;
1450,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"For there, instead of a golden street,"
1451,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"The hot, sharp stones abused his feet."
1452,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1453,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"So tired he was he was fit to fall,--"
1454,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Yet nobody cared for him at all;
1455,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"He wandered here, and he wandered there,"
1456,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"With a heavy heart, for many a square."
1457,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And at last, when he could walk no more,"
1458,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,He sank down faint at a merchant's door.
1459,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And the cook--for once compassionate--
1460,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Took him in at the area-gate.
1461,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1462,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And she gave him bits of broken meat,"
1463,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And scattered crusts, and crumbs, to eat;"
1464,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And kept him there for her commands
1465,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"To pare potatoes, and scour pans,"
1466,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,To wash the kettles and sweep the room;
1467,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And she beat him dreadfully with the broom;
1468,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And he staid as long as he could stay,"
1469,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And again, in despair, he ran away."
1470,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1471,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Out towards the famous Highgate Hill
1472,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"He fled, in the morning gray and chill;"
1473,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And there he sat on a wayside stone,"
1474,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And the bells of Bow, with merry tone,"
1475,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Jangled a musical chime together,"
1476,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Over the miles of blooming heather:
1477,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"""Turn, turn, turn again, Whittington,"
1478,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Thrice Lord Mayor of London town!"""
1479,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1480,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And he turned--so cheered he was at that--
1481,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And, meeting a boy who carried a cat,"
1482,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"He bought the cat with his only penny,--"
1483,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,For where he had slept the mice were many.
1484,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Back to the merchant's his way he took,"
1485,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"To the pans and potatoes and cruel cook,"
1486,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And he found Miss Puss a fine device,"
1487,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,For she kept his garret clear of mice.
1488,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1489,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"The merchant was sending his ship abroad,"
1490,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And he let each servant share her load;
1491,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"One sent this thing, and one sent that,"
1492,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And little Dick Whittington sent his cat.
1493,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"The ship sailed out and over the sea,"
1494,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Till she touched at last at a far country;
1495,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And while she waited to sell her store,"
1496,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,The captain and officers went ashore.
1497,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1498,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,They dined with the king; the tables fine
1499,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Groaned with the meat and fruit and wine;
1500,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"But, as soon as the guests were ranged about,"
1501,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Millions of rats and mice came out.
1502,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"They swarmed on the table, and on the floor,"
1503,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Up from the crevices, in at the door,"
1504,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"They swept the food away in a breath,"
1505,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,And the guests were frightened almost to death!
1506,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,
1507,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,To lose their dinners they thought a shame.
1508,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,The captain sent for the cat. She came!
1509,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"And right and left, in a wonderful way,"
1510,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"She threw, and slew, and spread dismay."
1511,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Then the Moorish king spoke up so bold:
1512,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"""I will give you eighteen bags of gold,"
1513,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"If you will sell me the little thing."""
1514,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"""I will!"" and the cat belonged to the king."

1516,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"When the good ship's homeward voyage was done,"
1517,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,The money was paid to Dick Whittington;
1518,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,At his master's wish 'twas put in trade;
1519,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Each dollar another dollar made.
1520,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"Richer he grew each month and year,"
1521,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,Honored by all both far and near;
1522,DICK WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT.,"With his master's daughter for a wife,"

1775,CAMPING OUT.,
1776,CAMPING OUT.,
1777,CAMPING OUT.,Dame Spider had spun herself lank and thin
1778,CAMPING OUT.,With trying to take her neighbors in;
1779,CAMPING OUT.,Grasshopper had traveled so far and so fast
1780,CAMPING OUT.,That he found he must give up at last;
1781,CAMPING OUT.,And the maiden Ant had bustled about
1782,CAMPING OUT.,The village till she was all worn out.
1783,CAMPING OUT.,
1784,CAMPING OUT.,Old Bumble Bee had lived on sweet
1785,CAMPING OUT.,Till he couldn't help but overeat;
1786,CAMPING OUT.,Miss Worm had measured her puny length
1787,CAMPING OUT.,Till she had no longer any strength;
1788,CAMPING OUT.,And Mr. Beetle was shocked to find
1789,CAMPING OUT.,His eyes were failing and almost blind.
1790,CAMPING OUT.,
1791,CAMPING OUT.,So they all decided that they must seek
1792,CAMPING OUT.,Their health in the country for a week.
1793,CAMPING OUT.,"And they made a mixed but a merry throng,"
1794,CAMPING OUT.,For those who had children took them along.
1795,CAMPING OUT.,"They pitched their tent and made their camp,"

1797,CAMPING OUT.,
1798,CAMPING OUT.,"'Twas novel, and each in his own way"
1799,CAMPING OUT.,Sought to make happy the holiday.
1800,CAMPING OUT.,Grasshopper took his youngest daughter
1801,CAMPING OUT.,Out for a stroll along the water;
1802,CAMPING OUT.,"She shrieked with joy, ""O, see the cherries!"""
1803,CAMPING OUT.,When they found some low-bush huckleberries.
1804,CAMPING OUT.,
1805,CAMPING OUT.,"Dame Spider, with mischief in her eye,"
1806,CAMPING OUT.,Thought she would angle for a fly;
1807,CAMPING OUT.,"So, spinning a silk thread, long and fine,"
1808,CAMPING OUT.,With wicked skill she cast the line;
1809,CAMPING OUT.,"While Bumble Bee, in his gold-laced clothes,"
1810,CAMPING OUT.,In the shade of a clover leaf lay for a doze.
1811,CAMPING OUT.,
1812,CAMPING OUT.,"Miss Worm, who was full of sentiment,"
1813,CAMPING OUT.,With the maiden Ant for a ramble went;
1814,CAMPING OUT.,"Here was a flower, and there a flower--"
1815,CAMPING OUT.,But suddenly rose a thunder shower.
1816,CAMPING OUT.,"They screamed; but they got on very well,"
1817,CAMPING OUT.,"For they found what the Ant called an ""umberell."""
1818,CAMPING OUT.,
1819,CAMPING OUT.,"A leaf on the water lay afloat,"
1820,CAMPING OUT.,Which the blundering Beetle thought a boat.
1821,CAMPING OUT.,Far down in his heart his dearest wish
1822,CAMPING OUT.,Was to find some hitherto unfound fish.
1823,CAMPING OUT.,"He never came back from that fatal swim,"
1824,CAMPING OUT.,So 'twas always thought that a fish found him.
1825,CAMPING OUT.,
1826,CAMPING OUT.,At night when the cheery fire was lit
1827,CAMPING OUT.,"They heaped dry branches over it,"
1828,CAMPING OUT.,And in the light of the crackling blaze
1829,CAMPING OUT.,"Told funny stories of other days,"
1830,CAMPING OUT.,"And smoked, till the Ant yawned wide and said:"
1831,CAMPING OUT.,"""'Tis time we folks were all abed!"""
1832,CAMPING OUT.,
1833,CAMPING OUT.,"But scarce was each to his slumber laid,"
1834,CAMPING OUT.,When the country folks came to serenade;
1835,CAMPING OUT.,"With twang of fiddle, and toot of horn,"
1836,CAMPING OUT.,"And shriek of fife, they stayed till morn!"

1878,DAME SPIDER.,Tied knots so tight that he could not undo them;
1879,DAME SPIDER.,Wove snares so strong that he could not break through them;

2014,DAME FIDGET AND HER SILVER PENNY.,"""Ha, ha!"" the water gurgled,"

2024,DAME FIDGET AND HER SILVER PENNY.,
2025,DAME FIDGET AND HER SILVER PENNY.,"But the ox bellowed ""no!"""
2026,DAME FIDGET AND HER SILVER PENNY.,So she shouted to the butcher:--

2114,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,"""Here, here is my nest! See! see!"""
2115,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,

2128,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,"""Here, here is a nest! See! see!"""
2129,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,
2130,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,And Teddy would like to creep
2131,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,"Tip-toe across the meadow,"
2132,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,And for just one minute stoop and peep
2133,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,Under the clover shadow.
2134,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,He would do no harm--not he!
2135,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,"But would only see, see, see!"

2137,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,And what would he find below

2140,FOOLISH BOBOLINK.,A mother's dark wings under.

2169,ALADDIN,
2170,ALADDIN,
2171,ALADDIN,"I see a little group about my chair,"
2172,ALADDIN,Lovers of stories all!
2173,ALADDIN,"First, Saxon Edith, of the corn-silk hair,"
2174,ALADDIN,Growing so strong and tall!
2175,ALADDIN,
2176,ALADDIN,"Then little brother, on whose sturdy face"
2177,ALADDIN,"Soft baby dimples fly,"
2178,ALADDIN,As fear or pleasure give each other place
2179,ALADDIN,When wonders multiply;
2180,ALADDIN,
2181,ALADDIN,Then Gold-locks--summers nine their goldenest
2182,ALADDIN,"Have showered on her head,"
2183,ALADDIN,"And tinted it, of all the colors best,"
2184,ALADDIN,Warm robin-red breast red;
2185,ALADDIN,
2186,ALADDIN,"Then, close at hand, on lowly haunches set,"
2187,ALADDIN,"With pricked up, tasseled ear,"
2188,ALADDIN,"Is Tony, little cleared-eyed spaniel pet,"
2189,ALADDIN,"Waiting, like them, to hear."
2190,ALADDIN,
2191,ALADDIN,I say I have no story--all are told!
2192,ALADDIN,"Not to be daunted thus,"
2193,ALADDIN,"They only crowd more confident and bold,"
2194,ALADDIN,"And laugh, incredulous."
2195,ALADDIN,
2196,ALADDIN,"And so, remembering how, once on a time,"
2197,ALADDIN,"I, too, loved such delights,"
2198,ALADDIN,"I choose this one and put it into rhyme,"
2199,ALADDIN,"From the ""Arabian Nights."""
2200,ALADDIN,
2201,ALADDIN,
2202,ALADDIN,A poor little lad was Aladdin!
2203,ALADDIN,His mother was wretchedly poor;
2204,ALADDIN,"A widow, who scarce ever had in"
2205,ALADDIN,Her cupboard enough of a store
2206,ALADDIN,To frighten the wolf from the door.
2207,ALADDIN,
2208,ALADDIN,No doubt he was quite a fine fellow
2209,ALADDIN,"For the country he lived in--but, ah!"
2210,ALADDIN,"His skin was a dull, dusky yellow,"
2211,ALADDIN,And his hair was as long as 'twould grow.
2212,ALADDIN,"('Tis the fashion in China, you know.)"
2213,ALADDIN,
2214,ALADDIN,"But however he looked, or however"
2215,ALADDIN,"He fared, a strange fortune was his."
2216,ALADDIN,"None of you, dears, though fair-faced and clever,"
2217,ALADDIN,"Can have anything like to this,"
2218,ALADDIN,So grand and so marvelous it is!
2219,ALADDIN,
2220,ALADDIN,"Well, one day--for so runs the tradition--"
2221,ALADDIN,While idling and lingering about
2222,ALADDIN,"The low city streets, a Magician"
2223,ALADDIN,"From Africa, swarthy and stout,"
2224,ALADDIN,"With his wise, prying eyes spied him out,"
2225,ALADDIN,
2226,ALADDIN,"And went up to him very politely,"
2227,ALADDIN,And asked what his name was and cried:
2228,ALADDIN,"""My lad, if I judge of you rightly,"
2229,ALADDIN,You're the son of my brother who died--
2230,ALADDIN,"My poor Mustafa!""--and he sighed."
2231,ALADDIN,
2232,ALADDIN,"""Ah, yes, Mustafa was my father,"""
2233,ALADDIN,"Aladdin cried back, ""and he's dead!"""
2234,ALADDIN,"""Well, then, both yourself and your mother"
2235,ALADDIN,"I will care for forever,"" he said,"
2236,ALADDIN,"""And you never shall lack wine nor bread."""
2237,ALADDIN,
2238,ALADDIN,And thus did the wily old wizard
2239,ALADDIN,Deceive with his kindness the two
2240,ALADDIN,For a deed of dark peril and hazard
2241,ALADDIN,"He had for Aladdin to do,"
2242,ALADDIN,"At the risk of his life, too, he knew."
2243,ALADDIN,
2244,ALADDIN,Far down in the earth's very centre
2245,ALADDIN,There burned a strange lamp at a shrine;
2246,ALADDIN,Great stones marked the one place to enter;
2247,ALADDIN,Down under t'was dark as a mine;
2248,ALADDIN,What further--no one could divine!
2249,ALADDIN,
2250,ALADDIN,And that was the treasure Aladdin
2251,ALADDIN,Was sent to secure. First he tore
2252,ALADDIN,"The huge stones away, for he had in"
2253,ALADDIN,An instant the strength of a score;
2254,ALADDIN,Then he stepped through the cavern-like door.
2255,ALADDIN,
2256,ALADDIN,"Down, down, through the darkness so chilly!"
2257,ALADDIN,"On, on, through the long galleries!"
2258,ALADDIN,"Coming now upon gardens of lilies,"
2259,ALADDIN,"And now upon fruit-burdened trees,"
2260,ALADDIN,Filled full of the humming of bees.
2261,ALADDIN,
2262,ALADDIN,"But, ah, should one tip of his finger"
2263,ALADDIN,"Touch aught as he passed, it was death!"
2264,ALADDIN,"Not a fruit on the boughs made him linger,"
2265,ALADDIN,Nor the great heaps of gold underneath.
2266,ALADDIN,"But on he fled, holding his breath,"
2267,ALADDIN,
2268,ALADDIN,"Until he espied, brightly burning,"
2269,ALADDIN,The mystical lamp in its place!
2270,ALADDIN,"He plucked the hot wick out, and, turning,"
2271,ALADDIN,"With triumph and joy in his face,"
2272,ALADDIN,Set out his long way to retrace.
2273,ALADDIN,
2274,ALADDIN,At last he saw where daylight shed a
2275,ALADDIN,"Soft ray through a chink overhead,"
2276,ALADDIN,Where the crafty Magician was ready
2277,ALADDIN,To catch the first sound of his tread.
2278,ALADDIN,"""Reach the lamp up to me, first!"" he said."
2279,ALADDIN,
2280,ALADDIN,"Aladdin with luck had grown bolder,"
2281,ALADDIN,"And he cried, ""Wait a bit, and we'll see!"""
2282,ALADDIN,"Then with huge, ugly push of his shoulder,"
2283,ALADDIN,"And with strong, heavy thrust of his knee,"
2284,ALADDIN,The wizard--so angry was he--
2285,ALADDIN,
2286,ALADDIN,"Pried up the great rock, rolled it over"
2287,ALADDIN,The door with an oath and a stamp;
2288,ALADDIN,"""Stay there under that little cover,"
2289,ALADDIN,"And die of the mildew and damp,"""
2290,ALADDIN,"He shouted, ""or give me the lamp!"""
2291,ALADDIN,
2292,ALADDIN,Aladdin saw darkness fall o'er him;
2293,ALADDIN,"He clutched at the lamp in his hand,"
2294,ALADDIN,"And, happening to rub it, before him"
2295,ALADDIN,"A Genius stood, stately and grand."
2296,ALADDIN,Whence he came he could not understand.
2297,ALADDIN,
2298,ALADDIN,"""I obey you,"" it said, ""and whatever"
2299,ALADDIN,"You ask for, or wish, you shall have!"
2300,ALADDIN,"Rub the lamp but the least bit soever,"
2301,ALADDIN,"It calls me, for I am its slave!"""
2302,ALADDIN,"Aladdin said, ""Open this cave!"""
2303,ALADDIN,
2304,ALADDIN,He was freed from the place in a minute;
2305,ALADDIN,"And he rubbed once again: ""Take me home!"""
2306,ALADDIN,Home he was. And as blithe as a linnet
2307,ALADDIN,"Rubbed again for the Genius with: ""Come,"
2308,ALADDIN,"I am dying for food; get me some!"""
2309,ALADDIN,
2310,ALADDIN,Thus at first he but valued his treasure
2311,ALADDIN,Because simple wants it supplied.
2312,ALADDIN,Grown older it furnished him pleasure;
2313,ALADDIN,And then it brought riches beside;
2314,ALADDIN,"And, at last, it secured him his bride."
2315,ALADDIN,
2316,ALADDIN,Now the Princess most lovely of any
2317,ALADDIN,"Was Badroulboudour, (what a name!)"
2318,ALADDIN,"Who, though sought for and sued for by many,"
2319,ALADDIN,"No matter how grandly they came,"
2320,ALADDIN,"Yet merrily laughed them to shame,"
2321,ALADDIN,
2322,ALADDIN,"Until with his riches and splendor,"
2323,ALADDIN,Aladdin as lover enrolled!
2324,ALADDIN,For the first thing he did was to send her
2325,ALADDIN,"Some forty great baskets of gold,"
2326,ALADDIN,And all the fine gems they would hold.
2327,ALADDIN,
2328,ALADDIN,"Then he built her a palace, set thickly"
2329,ALADDIN,With jewels at window and door;
2330,ALADDIN,And all was completed so quickly
2331,ALADDIN,She saw bannered battlements soar
2332,ALADDIN,Where was nothing an hour before.
2333,ALADDIN,
2334,ALADDIN,"There millions of servants attended,"
2335,ALADDIN,"Black slaves and white slaves, thick as bees,"
2336,ALADDIN,"Obedient, attentive, and splendid"
2337,ALADDIN,"In purple and gold liveries,"
2338,ALADDIN,"Fine to see, swift to serve, sure to please!"
2339,ALADDIN,
2340,ALADDIN,Him she wedded. They lived without trouble
2341,ALADDIN,As long as the lamp was their own;
2342,ALADDIN,"But one day, like the burst of a bubble,"
2343,ALADDIN,The palace and Princess were gone;
2344,ALADDIN,Without wings to fly they had flown!
2345,ALADDIN,
2346,ALADDIN,"And Aladdin, dismayed to discover"
2347,ALADDIN,"That the lamp had been stolen away,"
2348,ALADDIN,Bent all of his strength to recover
2349,ALADDIN,"The treasure, and day after day,"
2350,ALADDIN,He journeyed this way and that way;
2351,ALADDIN,
2352,ALADDIN,"And at last, after terrible hazard,"
2353,ALADDIN,"After many a peril and strife,"
2354,ALADDIN,"He found that the vengeful old wizard,"
2355,ALADDIN,"Who had made the attempt on his life,"
2356,ALADDIN,"Had stolen lamp, princess and wife."
2357,ALADDIN,
2358,ALADDIN,With a shrewdness which would have done credit
2359,ALADDIN,"To even a Yankee boy, he"
2360,ALADDIN,"Sought the lamp where the wizard had hid it,"
2361,ALADDIN,"And, turning a mystical key,"
2362,ALADDIN,"Brought it forth, and then, rubbing with glee,"
2363,ALADDIN,
2364,ALADDIN,"""Back to China!"" he cried. In a minute"
2365,ALADDIN,"The marvellous palace uprose,"
2366,ALADDIN,With the Princess Badroulboudour in it
2367,ALADDIN,"Unruffled in royal repose,"
2368,ALADDIN,With her jewels and cloth-of-gold clothes;
2369,ALADDIN,
2370,ALADDIN,"And with gay clouds of banners and towers,"
2371,ALADDIN,"With its millions of slaves, white and black."
2372,ALADDIN,"It was borne by obedient Powers,"
2373,ALADDIN,"As swift as the wind on its track,"
2374,ALADDIN,And ere one could count ten it was back!
2375,ALADDIN,
2376,ALADDIN,"And ever thereafter, Aladdin"
2377,ALADDIN,"Clung close to the lamp of his fate,"
2378,ALADDIN,"Whatever the robe he was clad in,"
2379,ALADDIN,Or whether he fasted or ate;
2380,ALADDIN,"And at all hours, early and late!"
2381,ALADDIN,Right lucky was Lord Aladdin!

2389,BLUE BEARD,Once on a time there was a man so hideous and ugly

2391,BLUE BEARD,"His eyes were fierce and prominent, his long hair stiff like bristles,"
2392,BLUE BEARD,"His stature was enormous, and he wore a long blue beard--"
2393,BLUE BEARD,"He took his name from that through all the country round about him,--"
2394,BLUE BEARD,And whispered tales of dreadful deeds but helped to make him feared.
2395,BLUE BEARD,
2396,BLUE BEARD,"Yet he was rich, O! very rich; his home was in a castle,"
2397,BLUE BEARD,"Whose turrets darkened on the sky, so grand and black and bold"
2398,BLUE BEARD,That like a thunder-cloud it looked upon the blue horizon.
2399,BLUE BEARD,He had fertile lands and parks and towns
2400,BLUE BEARD,"and hunting-grounds and gold,"
2401,BLUE BEARD,"And tapestries a queen might covet, statues, pictures, jewels,"
2402,BLUE BEARD,"While his servants numbered hundreds,"
2403,BLUE BEARD,and his wines were rare and old.
2404,BLUE BEARD,
2405,BLUE BEARD,"Now near to this old Blue-beard's castle lived a lady neighbor,"
2406,BLUE BEARD,"Who had two daughters, beautiful as lilies on a stem;"
2407,BLUE BEARD,And he asked that one of them be given him in marriage--
2408,BLUE BEARD,"He did not care which one it was, but left the choice to them."
2409,BLUE BEARD,"But, oh, the terror that they felt, their efforts to evade him,"
2410,BLUE BEARD,"With careless art, with coquetry, with wile and stratagem!"
2411,BLUE BEARD,
2412,BLUE BEARD,"He saw their high young spirits scorned him, yet he meant to conquer."
2413,BLUE BEARD,"He planned a visit for them,--or, 'twas rather one long fête;"
2414,BLUE BEARD,"And to charming guests and lovely feasts, to music and to dancing,"
2415,BLUE BEARD,Swung wide upon its hinges grim the gloomy castle gate.
2416,BLUE BEARD,"And, sure enough, before a week was ended, blinded, dazzled,"
2417,BLUE BEARD,"The youngest maiden whispered ""yes,"" and yielded to her fate."
2418,BLUE BEARD,
2419,BLUE BEARD,And so she wedded Blue-beard--like a wise and wily spider
2420,BLUE BEARD,"He had lured into his web the wished-for, silly little fly!"
2421,BLUE BEARD,"And, before the honeymoon was gone, one day he stood beside her,"
2422,BLUE BEARD,"And with oily words of sorrow, but with evil in his eye,"
2423,BLUE BEARD,"Said his business for a month or more would call him to a distance,"
2424,BLUE BEARD,"And he must leave her--sorry to--but then, she must not cry!"
2425,BLUE BEARD,
2426,BLUE BEARD,"He bade her have her friends, as many as she liked, about her,"
2427,BLUE BEARD,"And handed her a jingling bunch of something, saying, ""These"
2428,BLUE BEARD,Will open vaults and cellars and the heavy iron boxes
2429,BLUE BEARD,"Where all my gold and jewels are, or any door you please."
2430,BLUE BEARD,"Go where you like, do what you will, one single thing excepted!"""
2431,BLUE BEARD,And here he look a little key from out the bunch of keys.
2432,BLUE BEARD,
2433,BLUE BEARD,"""This will unlock the closet at the end of the long passage,"
2434,BLUE BEARD,"But that you must not enter! I forbid it!""--and he frowned."
2435,BLUE BEARD,"So she promised that she would not, and he went upon his journey."
2436,BLUE BEARD,And no sooner was he gone than all her merry friends around
2437,BLUE BEARD,"Came to visit her, and made the dim old corridors and chambers"
2438,BLUE BEARD,"With their silken dresses whisper, with laugh and song resound."
2439,BLUE BEARD,
2440,BLUE BEARD,"Up and down the oaken stairways flitted dainty-footed ladies,"
2441,BLUE BEARD,Lighting up the shadowy twilight with the lustre of their bloom;
2442,BLUE BEARD,Like the varied sunlight streaming through an old cathedral window
2443,BLUE BEARD,"Went their brightness glancing through the unaccustomed gloom,"
2444,BLUE BEARD,"But Blue-beard's wife was restless, and a strong desire possessed her"
2445,BLUE BEARD,Through it all to get a single peep at that forbidden room.
2446,BLUE BEARD,
2447,BLUE BEARD,"And so one day she slipped away from all her guests, unnoted,"
2448,BLUE BEARD,"Down through the lower passage, till she reached the fatal door,"
2449,BLUE BEARD,"Put in the key and turned the lock, and gently pushed it open--"
2450,BLUE BEARD,"But, oh the horrid sight that met her eyes! Upon the floor"
2451,BLUE BEARD,"There were blood-stains dark and dreadful,"
2452,BLUE BEARD,"and like dresses in a wardrobe,"
2453,BLUE BEARD,"There were women hung up by their hair, and dripping in their gore!"
2454,BLUE BEARD,
2455,BLUE BEARD,"Then, at once, upon her mind the unknown fate that had befallen"
2456,BLUE BEARD,The other wives of Blue-beard flashed--'twas now no mystery!
2457,BLUE BEARD,"She started back as cold as icicles, as white as ashes,"
2458,BLUE BEARD,And upon the clammy floor her trembling fingers dropped the key.
2459,BLUE BEARD,"She caught it up, she whirled the bolt to, shut the sight behind her,"
2460,BLUE BEARD,"And like a startled deer at sound of hunter's gun, fled she!"
2461,BLUE BEARD,
2462,BLUE BEARD,"She reached her room with gasping breath,--behold, another terror!"
2463,BLUE BEARD,Upon the key within her hand; she saw a ghastly stain;
2464,BLUE BEARD,"She rubbed it with her handkerchief, she washed in soap and water,"
2465,BLUE BEARD,"She scoured it with sand and stone, but all was done in vain!"
2466,BLUE BEARD,"For when one side, by dint of work, grew bright, upon the other"
2467,BLUE BEARD,"(It was bewitched, you know,) came out that ugly spot again!"
2468,BLUE BEARD,
2469,BLUE BEARD,"And then, unlooked-for, who should come"
2470,BLUE BEARD,"next morning, bright and early,"
2471,BLUE BEARD,But old Blue-beard himself who hadn't been away a week!
2472,BLUE BEARD,"He kissed his wife, and, after a brief pause, said, smiling blandly:"
2473,BLUE BEARD,"""I'd like my keys, my dear."" He saw a tear upon her cheek,"
2474,BLUE BEARD,And guessed the truth. She gave him all
2475,BLUE BEARD,but one. He scowled and grumbled:
2476,BLUE BEARD,"""I want the key to the _small room_!"""
2477,BLUE BEARD,"Poor thing, she could not speak!"
2478,BLUE BEARD,
2479,BLUE BEARD,"He saw at once the stain it bore while she turned pale and paler,"
2480,BLUE BEARD,"""You've been where I forbade you! Now you shall go there _to stay_!"
2481,BLUE BEARD,"Prepare yourself to die at once!"" he cried. The frightened lady"
2482,BLUE BEARD,"Could only fall before him pleading: ""Give me time to pray!"""
2483,BLUE BEARD,Just fifteen minutes by the clock he granted. To her chamber
2484,BLUE BEARD,"She fled, but stopped to call her sister Anne by the way."
2485,BLUE BEARD,
2486,BLUE BEARD,"""O, sister Anne, go to the tower and watch!"" she cried, ""Our brothers"
2487,BLUE BEARD,"Were coming here to-day, and I have got to die!"
2488,BLUE BEARD,"Oh, fly, and if you see them, wave a signal! Hasten! hasten!"""
2489,BLUE BEARD,And Anne went flying like a bird up to the tower high.
2490,BLUE BEARD,"""Oh, Anne, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"""
2491,BLUE BEARD,Called the praying lady up the tower-stairs with piteous cry.
2492,BLUE BEARD,
2493,BLUE BEARD,"""Oh Anne, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"""
2494,BLUE BEARD,"""I see the burning sun,"" she answered, ""and the waving grass!"""
2495,BLUE BEARD,"Meanwhile old Blue-beard down below was whetting up his cutlass,"
2496,BLUE BEARD,"And shouting: ""Come down quick, or I'll come after you, my lass!"""
2497,BLUE BEARD,"""One little minute more to pray, one minute more!"" she pleaded--"
2498,BLUE BEARD,"To hope how slow the minutes are, to dread how swift they pass!"
2499,BLUE BEARD,
2500,BLUE BEARD,"""Oh Anne, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"""
2501,BLUE BEARD,"She answered: ""Yes I see a cloud of dust that moves this way."""
2502,BLUE BEARD,"""Is it our brothers, Anne?"" implored the lady. ""No, my sister,"
2503,BLUE BEARD,"It is a flock of sheep."" Here Blue-beard thundered out: ""I say,"
2504,BLUE BEARD,"Come down or I'll come after you!"" Again the only answer:"
2505,BLUE BEARD,"""Oh, just one little minute more,--one minute more to pray!"""
2506,BLUE BEARD,
2507,BLUE BEARD,"""Oh, Anne, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"""
2508,BLUE BEARD,"""I see two horsemen riding, but they yet are very far!"""
2509,BLUE BEARD,"She waved them with her handkerchief; it bade them, ""hasten, hasten!"""
2510,BLUE BEARD,Then Blue-beard stamped his foot so hard
2511,BLUE BEARD,it made the whole house jar;
2512,BLUE BEARD,"And, rushing up to where his wife knelt, swung his glittering cutlass,"
2513,BLUE BEARD,"As Indians do a tomahawk, and shrieked: ""How slow you are!"""
2514,BLUE BEARD,
2515,BLUE BEARD,"Just then, without, was heard the beat of hoofs upon the pavement,"
2516,BLUE BEARD,"The doors flew back, the marble floors rang to a hurried tread."
2517,BLUE BEARD,"Two horsemen, with their swords in hand,"
2518,BLUE BEARD,"came storming up the stairway,"
2519,BLUE BEARD,And with one swoop of their good swords
2520,BLUE BEARD,they cut off Blue-beard's head!
2521,BLUE BEARD,"Down fell his cruel arm, the heavy cutlass falling with it,"
2522,BLUE BEARD,"And, instead of its old, ugly blue, his beard was bloody red!"
2523,BLUE BEARD,
2524,BLUE BEARD,"Of course, the tyrant dead, his wife had all his vast possessions;"
2525,BLUE BEARD,She gave her sister Anne a dower to marry where she would;
2526,BLUE BEARD,The brothers were rewarded with commissions in the army;
2527,BLUE BEARD,"And as for Blue-beard's wife, she did exactly as she should,--"
2528,BLUE BEARD,"She wore no weeds, she shed no tears; but very shortly after"
2529,BLUE BEARD,Married a man as fair to look at as his heart was good.

2547,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2548,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Versified by Clara Doty Bates
2549,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2550,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2551,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The ringing bells and the booming cannon
2552,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Proclaimed on a summer morn
2553,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,That in the good king's royal palace
2554,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,A Princess had been born.
2555,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2556,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The towers flung out their brightest banners,"
2557,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The ships their streamers gay,"
2558,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And every one, from lord to peasant,"
2559,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Made joyful holiday.
2560,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2561,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Great plans for feasting and merry-making
2562,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Were made by the happy king;
2563,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And, to bring good fortune, seven fairies"
2564,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Were bid to the christening.
2565,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2566,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And for them the king had seven dishes
2567,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Made out of the best red gold,"
2568,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Set thickly round on the sides and covers
2569,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,With jewels of price untold.
2570,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2571,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"When the day of the christening came, the bugles"
2572,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Blew forth their shrillest notes;
2573,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Drums throbbed, and endless lines of soldiers"
2574,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Filed past in scarlet coats.
2575,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2576,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And the fairies were there the king had bidden,"
2577,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Bearing their gifts of good--
2578,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,But right in the midst a strange old woman
2579,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Surly and scowling stood.
2580,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2581,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"They knew her to be the old, old fairy,"
2582,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"All nose and eyes and ears,"
2583,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Who had not peeped, till now, from her dungeon"
2584,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,For more than fifty years.
2585,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2586,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Angry she was to have been forgotten
2587,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Where others were guests, and to find"
2588,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,That neither a seat nor a dish at the banquet
2589,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,To her had been assigned.
2590,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2591,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Now came the hour for the gift-bestowing;
2592,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And the fairy first in place
2593,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Touched with her wand the child and gave her
2594,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""Beauty of form and face!"""
2595,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2596,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Fairy the second bade, ""Be witty!"""
2597,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The third said, ""Never fail!"""
2598,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The fourth, ""Dance well!"" and the fifth, ""O Princess,"
2599,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Sing like the nightingale!"""
2600,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2601,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The sixth gave, ""Joy in the heart forever!"""
2602,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"But before the seventh could speak,"
2603,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The crooked, black old Dame came forward,"
2604,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And, tapping the baby's cheek,"
2605,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2606,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""You shall prick your finger upon a spindle,"
2607,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And die of it!"" she cried."
2608,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"All trembling were the lords and ladies,"
2609,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And the king and queen beside.
2610,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2611,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"But the seventh fairy interrupted,"
2612,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""Do not tremble nor weep!"
2613,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"That cruel curse I can change and soften,"
2614,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And instead of death give sleep!
2615,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2616,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""But the sleep, though I do my best and kindest,"
2617,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Must last for an hundred years!"""
2618,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"On the king's stern face was a dreadful pallor,"
2619,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,In the eyes of the queen were tears.
2620,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2621,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""Yet after the hundred years are vanished,""--"
2622,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The fairy added beside,--"
2623,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""A Prince of a noble line shall find her,"
2624,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And take her for his bride."""
2625,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2626,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"But the king, with a hope to change the future,"
2627,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Proclaimed this law to be:
2628,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"That, if in all the land there was kept one spindle,"
2629,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Sure death was the penalty.
2630,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2631,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The Princess grew, from her very cradle"
2632,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Lovely and witty and good;
2633,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And at last, in the course of years, had blossomed"
2634,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Into full sweet maidenhood.
2635,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2636,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And one day, in her father's summer palace,"
2637,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"As blithe as the very air,"
2638,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"She climbed to the top of the highest turret,"
2639,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Over an old worn stair
2640,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2641,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And there in the dusky cobwebbed garret,"
2642,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Where dimly the daylight shone,"
2643,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"A little, doleful, hunch-backed woman"
2644,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Sat spinning all alone.
2645,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2646,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""O Goody,"" she cried, ""what are you doing?"""
2647,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""Why, spinning, you little dunce!"""
2648,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The Princess laughed: ""'Tis so very funny,"
2649,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Pray let me try it once!"""
2650,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2651,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"With a careless touch, from the hand of Goody"
2652,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"She caught the half-spun thread,"
2653,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And the fatal spindle pricked her finger!
2654,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Down fell she as if dead!
2655,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2656,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And Goody shrieking, the frightened courtiers"
2657,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Climbed up the old worn stair
2658,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Only to find, in heavy slumber,"
2659,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The Princess lying there.
2660,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2661,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"They bore her down to a lofty chamber,"
2662,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"They robed her in her best,"
2663,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And on a couch of gold and purple
2664,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"They laid her for her rest,"
2665,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2666,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The roses upon her cheek still blooming,"
2667,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And the red still on her lips,"
2668,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"While the lids of her eyes, like night-shut lilies,"
2669,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Were closed in white eclipse.
2670,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2671,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Then the fairy who strove her fate to alter
2672,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"From the dismal doom of death,"
2673,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Now that the vital hour impended,"
2674,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Came hurrying in a breath.
2675,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2676,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And then about the slumbering palace
2677,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The fairy made up-spring
2678,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,A wood so heavy and dense that never
2679,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Could enter a living thing.
2680,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2681,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And there for a century the Princess
2682,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Lay in a trance so deep
2683,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,That neither the roar of winds nor thunder
2684,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Could rouse her from her sleep.
2685,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2686,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Then at last one day, past the long-enchanted"
2687,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Old wood, rode a new king's son,"
2688,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Who, catching a glimpse of a royal turret"
2689,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Above the forest dun
2690,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2691,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Felt in his heart a strange wish for exploring
2692,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The thorny and briery place,"
2693,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And, lo, a path through the deepest thicket"
2694,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Opened before his face!
2695,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2696,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"On, on he went, till he spied a terrace,"
2697,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And further a sleeping guard,"
2698,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,And rows of soldiers upon their carbines
2699,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Leaning, and snoring hard."
2700,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2701,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Up the broad steps! The doors swung backward!
2702,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The wide halls heard no tread!
2703,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"But a lofty chamber, opening, showed him"
2704,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,A gold and purple bed.
2705,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2706,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And there in her beauty, warm and glowing,"
2707,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The enchanted Princess lay!
2708,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,While only a word from his lips was needed
2709,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,To drive her sleep away.
2710,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2711,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"He spoke the word, and the spell was scattered,"
2712,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,The enchantment broken through!
2713,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The lady woke. ""Dear Prince,"" she murmured,"
2714,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"""How long I have waited for you!"""
2715,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2716,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Then at once the whole great slumbering palace
2717,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Was wakened and all astir;
2718,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Yet the Prince, in joy at the Sleeping Beauty,"
2719,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Could only look at her.
2720,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2721,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,She was the bride who for years an hundred
2722,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Had waited for him to come,"
2723,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And now that the hour was here to claim her,"
2724,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Should eyes or tongue be dumb?
2725,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2726,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"The Princess blushed at his royal wooing,"
2727,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"Bowed ""yes"" with her lovely head,"
2728,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"And the chaplain, yawning, but very lively,"
2729,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,Came in and they were wed!
2730,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,
2731,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,"But about the dress of the happy Princess,"
2732,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,I have my woman's fears--
2733,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,It must have grown somewhat old-fashioned
2734,THE SLEEPING PRINCESS,In the course of so many years!

2772,JACK AND JILL.,Made bigger tracks on the country grass;
2773,JACK AND JILL.,For her only fun
2774,JACK AND JILL.,"Was to romp and run,"
2775,JACK AND JILL.,"Bare-headed, bare-footed, in wind and sun."
2776,JACK AND JILL.,
2777,JACK AND JILL.,"Wherever went Jack,"
2778,JACK AND JILL.,"Close on his track,"
2779,JACK AND JILL.,"With hair unbraided and down her back,"
2780,JACK AND JILL.,"Loud-voiced and shrill,"
2781,JACK AND JILL.,"She followed, until"
2782,JACK AND JILL.,"No one said ""Jack"" without saying ""Jill."""
2783,JACK AND JILL.,
2784,JACK AND JILL.,But to succeed
2785,JACK AND JILL.,In teaching to read
2786,JACK AND JILL.,"Such a harum-scarum, was work indeed!"
2787,JACK AND JILL.,And I'm forced to tell
2788,JACK AND JILL.,That her way to spell
2789,JACK AND JILL.,Her name was with only a single 'l.'
2790,JACK AND JILL.,
2791,JACK AND JILL.,Yet they were content.
2792,JACK AND JILL.,One day they were sent
2793,JACK AND JILL.,"To the hill for water, and they went."
2794,JACK AND JILL.,"They did not drown,"
2795,JACK AND JILL.,"But Jack fell down,"
2796,JACK AND JILL.,"With a pail in his hand, and broke his crown!"
2797,JACK AND JILL.,
2798,JACK AND JILL.,"And Jill, who must go"
2799,JACK AND JILL.,And always do
2800,JACK AND JILL.,"Exactly as Jack did, tumbled too!"
2801,JACK AND JILL.,"Just think, if you will,"
2802,JACK AND JILL.,How they rolled down hill--
2803,JACK AND JILL.,Straw-headed Jack and bare-footed Jill!
2804,JACK AND JILL.,
2805,JACK AND JILL.,"But up Jack got,"
2806,JACK AND JILL.,"And home did trot,"
2807,JACK AND JILL.,Nor cared whether Jill was hurt or not;
2808,JACK AND JILL.,While his poor bruised knob
2809,JACK AND JILL.,"Did burn and throb,"
2810,JACK AND JILL.,"Tear falling on tear, sob following sob!"
2811,JACK AND JILL.,
2812,JACK AND JILL.,"He could run the faster,"
2813,JACK AND JILL.,So a paper plaster
2814,JACK AND JILL.,Had bound up the sight of his disaster
2815,JACK AND JILL.,Before Jill came;
2816,JACK AND JILL.,"And the thoughtful dame,"
2817,JACK AND JILL.,"For a break in _her_ head, had fixed the same."
2818,JACK AND JILL.,
2819,JACK AND JILL.,"But Jill came in,"
2820,JACK AND JILL.,With a saucy grin
2821,JACK AND JILL.,At seeing the plight poor Jack was in;
2822,JACK AND JILL.,And when she saw
2823,JACK AND JILL.,That bundle of straw
2824,JACK AND JILL.,"(His hair) bound up with a cloth, and his jaw"
2825,JACK AND JILL.,
2826,JACK AND JILL.,"Tied up in white,"
2827,JACK AND JILL.,The comical sight
2828,JACK AND JILL.,Made her clap her hands and laugh outright!
2829,JACK AND JILL.,"The dame, perplexed"
2830,JACK AND JILL.,"And dreadfully vexed,"
2831,JACK AND JILL.,"Got a stick and said, ""I'll whip her next!"""
2832,JACK AND JILL.,
2833,JACK AND JILL.,How many blows fell
2834,JACK AND JILL.,"I will not tell,"
2835,JACK AND JILL.,"But she did it in earnest, she did it well,"
2836,JACK AND JILL.,Till the naughty back
2837,JACK AND JILL.,"Was blue and black,"
2838,JACK AND JILL.,And Jill needed a plaster as much as Jack!
2839,JACK AND JILL.,
2840,JACK AND JILL.,"The next time, though,"
2841,JACK AND JILL.,Jack has to go
2842,JACK AND JILL.,"To the hill for water, I almost know"
2843,JACK AND JILL.,That bothering Jill
2844,JACK AND JILL.,"Will go up the hill,"
2845,JACK AND JILL.,"And if _he_ falls again, why, of course _she_ will!"
2846,JACK AND JILL.,
2847,JACK AND JILL.,
2848,JACK AND JILL.,
2849,JACK AND JILL.,
2850,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,LITTLE BO-BEEP.
2851,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2852,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2853,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,What was Bo-Peep? Can anyone guess?
2854,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Why, little Bo-Peep was a shepherdess!"
2855,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And she dressed in a short white petticoat,"
2856,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And a kirtle of blue, with a looped-up look,"
2857,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And a snowy kerchief about her throat,"
2858,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And held in her hand a crook.
2859,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2860,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"What eyes she had, the little Bo-Peep!"
2861,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"They had tears to laugh with, and tears to weep."
2862,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"So fringy, and shy, and blue, and sweet,"
2863,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"That even the summer skies in color,"
2864,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Or the autumn gentians under her feet,"
2865,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Less tender were and duller.
2866,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2867,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Now, a shepherdess ought to watch her sheep;"
2868,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"But the careless little girl, Bo-Peep,"
2869,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Was hunting for late wild strawberries,"
2870,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,The sweetest her tongue had ever tasted;
2871,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"They were few in number, and small in size,"
2872,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Too good, though, to be wasted."
2873,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2874,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And in that way the little Bo-Peep,"
2875,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"The first she knew, had lost her sheep!"
2876,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"To the top of the nearest knoll she ran,"
2877,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,The better to look the pasture over;
2878,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She shaded her face, and called, ""Nan! Nan!"""
2879,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,But none of them could discover.
2880,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2881,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,About and about went little Bo-Peep;
2882,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Her feet grew tired, the hills were steep;"
2883,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And in trying her fears to overcome
2884,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She sighed, ""I don't know where to find 'em."
2885,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"But let 'em alone, and they'll come home,"
2886,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And bring their tails behind 'em!"""
2887,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2888,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"So down sat trustful little Bo-Peep,"
2889,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And in a minute was fast asleep!
2890,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Arm over her head, and her finger-ends"
2891,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,All red with the fruit she had been eating;
2892,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"While her thoughts were only of her lost friends,"
2893,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And she dreamed she heard them bleating.
2894,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2895,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,'Twas a happy dream for little Bo-Peep;
2896,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"As she lay on the grass, her flock of sheep,"
2897,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"With scatter and clatter and patter of feet,"
2898,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Came hastening from all ways hither, thither;"
2899,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"First one would bleat, then another would bleat,"
2900,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Then ""b-a-a--a-a!"" all together!"
2901,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2902,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"But ah, it was only while Bo-Peep"
2903,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Was tired enough to stay asleep
2904,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"That her flock was with her; for when she woke,"
2905,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Rubbing her eyes to see the clearer,"
2906,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She found that her dream was all a joke,"
2907,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And they were nowhere near her.
2908,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2909,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Tearful and sorrowful grew Bo-Peep!
2910,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Down from her lashes the tears would creep;
2911,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"But she started out, as there was need,"
2912,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Before it should be too dark to find them;
2913,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,"
2914,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,For they'd left their tails behind them!
2915,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2916,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Did she laugh or cry, our little Bo-Peep,"
2917,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,To see such a comical crowd of sheep?
2918,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"There were plenty of bodies, white and fat;"
2919,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And plenty of wide mouths, eating, eating;"
2920,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Plenty of soft wool, and all that:"
2921,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,And plenty of noisy bleating;
2922,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2923,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Yet all of them stood, and tried to keep"
2924,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,At a little distance from Bo-Peep!
2925,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"They knew her voice, and were very glad"
2926,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"To have her come with her crook to find them,"
2927,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,But they felt so strangely because they had
2928,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Not a single tail behind them.
2929,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2930,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"The innocent-faced old mother-sheep,"
2931,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Who bleated and stamped to greet Bo-Peep,"
2932,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"With their tails shorn close, were odd enough;"
2933,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,But the very oddest of all was when a
2934,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Group of the lambs went galloping off,"
2935,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"All legs, and hadn't any!"
2936,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2937,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Though sorry enough was little Bo-Peep
2938,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"That the tails were lost from her pretty sheep,"
2939,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She murmured, ""I'll find them easily,"
2940,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And there's very little good in crying!"""
2941,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"So away she went, and at last, in a tree,"
2942,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,She saw them hung a-drying!
2943,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2944,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"She piled them up in a great white heap,"
2945,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"And the best she could do, poor little Bo-Peep!"
2946,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Was to try to fasten them where they grew--
2947,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Or that was, at least, what she intended,--"
2948,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"But if she did it I never knew,"
2949,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,For now my story is ended!
2950,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2951,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2952,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2953,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2954,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,[Color Plate:]
2955,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,
2956,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Buz, Buz, Buz--says the Great buzzing Bee."
2957,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,Go away butterfly--this flower is for me.
2958,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"Why? Why? Why? says the little butterfly,"
2959,LITTLE BO-BEEP.,"If you may sit on this flower, why may'nt I?"

2964,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,HOP-O-MY-THUMB
2965,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2966,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2967,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Once on a time there was a fagot-maker,"
2968,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And he had seven sons.
2969,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Who could be aught but poor to feed and shelter
2970,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,So many little ones?
2971,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2972,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,For all were merely lads; not one was able
2973,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"To earn the crust of bread,"
2974,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Though scant it might be, coarse and black and humble,"
2975,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,With which he must be fed.
2976,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2977,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And, worst of all, the youngest one was puny,"
2978,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"So odd, and still, and slight,"
2979,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"That father, mother, and the other brothers,"
2980,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Thought him not over bright.
2981,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2982,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"So small he was when he was born, so tiny"
2983,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Since then he had become,"
2984,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,That--for he was no bigger than your finger--
2985,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,They called him Hop-o'-my-Thumb.
2986,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2987,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Now at this time, for days and days together,"
2988,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,There fell no drop of rain;
2989,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,The corn shrunk on the stalks; and in the sunshine
2990,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Rustled the shriveled grain;
2991,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2992,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,As if a fire had swept across the meadows
2993,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,They shriveled in the drouth;
2994,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And what this meant for the poor fagot-maker
2995,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Was famine, without doubt."
2996,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
2997,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"One night he sat before a smouldering fire,"
2998,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"His head bowed down with grief,"
2999,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Trying with those weak wits of his to compass
3000,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Some scheme for their relief.
3001,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3002,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"His wife above the feeble embers hovered,"
3003,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And wrung her toil-hard hands;
3004,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"She knew there was no help for their starvation,"
3005,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,No hope in making plans.
3006,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3007,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"At last he spoke: ""Ah, bad luck to the trying,"
3008,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,I cannot find them food!
3009,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,To-morrow morning with me to the forest
3010,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,I'll take the little brood!
3011,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3012,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""I cannot bear to watch this piece meal starving,"
3013,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"So, while they run and play,"
3014,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Or gather fagots for me, or pick berries"
3015,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"To eat, I'll come away!"""
3016,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3017,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Oh!"" groaned the wife, ""I'm sure the wolves will eat them,"
3018,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Poor dears--poor little dears!
3019,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Yet do as you think best--we all must perish!"""
3020,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Then went to bed in tears.
3021,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3022,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Meanwhile, though all the rest were sleeping soundly,"
3023,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Hop-o'-my-Thumb had heard,"
3024,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And at the thought of wolves and woods, in terror"
3025,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,His little heart was stirred;
3026,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3027,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And so he lay and planned; and early dressed him,"
3028,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And ran with all his might
3029,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Down to the river, where he filled his pockets"
3030,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,With pebbles small and white.
3031,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3032,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And, as they started for the wood, he lingered"
3033,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Somewhat behind, and when"
3034,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"They came to dismal places, dropped in secret"
3035,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,A pebble now and then.
3036,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3037,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Thick grew the trees; 'twas twilight in their shadows,"
3038,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Although broad day without;
3039,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,But gay the laddies at the fagot-picking
3040,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Went scampering about,"
3041,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3042,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And chattering like a flock of busy sparrows;
3043,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Till, having hungry grown,"
3044,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"They turned to ask their mother for their dinner,"
3045,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And found they were alone!
3046,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3047,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Then all but Hop-o'-my-Thumb wailed out affrighted.
3048,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Don't cry so hard!"" said he."
3049,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""I'll find the path, if you'll but keep together"
3050,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And try to follow me!"""
3051,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3052,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"By the white stones strewn on the dead pine needles,"
3053,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Though night had fallen, he soon"
3054,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Led the way out, and spied their humble cottage,"
3055,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Low lying 'neath the moon.
3056,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3057,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"They hurried near, and, pausing at the window,"
3058,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Hop-o'my-Thumb climbed up,"
3059,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And peeped within; his father and his mother
3060,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Were just about to sup.
3061,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3062,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Some one had paid them two gold guineas
3063,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,On an old debt; and when
3064,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"They went for beef for two, they were so hungry"
3065,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,They bought enough for ten.
3066,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3067,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Quick as a flash the ravenous seven went rushing
3068,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Pell-mell into the house,"
3069,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Nor left, of the fine roast upon the table,"
3070,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Enough to feed a mouse.
3071,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3072,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,It all went well long as the money lasted.
3073,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"When that was gone, once more"
3074,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"The father planned to take them to the forest,"
3075,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And leave them as before.
3076,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3077,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Hop-o'-my-Thumb, who heard again the plotting,"
3078,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Crept from his trundle-bed,"
3079,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,But in the place of pebbles in his pockets
3080,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Put only crumbs of bread.
3081,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3082,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Again they went, through brier and through thicket,"
3083,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Into the darksome wood;
3084,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Again he dropped his clues along the pathway
3085,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Behind him when he could.
3086,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3087,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"But when once more they found themselves deserted,"
3088,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And little Hop-o'-my-Thumb
3089,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Felt sure to lead them out, he found the finches"
3090,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Had eaten every crumb!
3091,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3092,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Then what to do! They wandered hither, thither,"
3093,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"For hours in dread and fear,"
3094,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Until at last they saw, with fitful glimmer,"
3095,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,A feeble light appear.
3096,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3097,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"It shone but faintly, like a single candle,"
3098,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"But, trudging towards the ray,"
3099,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,They reached a house and knocked; the door was opened
3100,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"After a brief delay,"
3101,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3102,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And a kind woman asked them what they wanted.
3103,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"They said: ""To stay all night."""
3104,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Run, run away! The faster you run the better!"""
3105,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,She answered in affright.
3106,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3107,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""An Ogre lives here, cruel and bloody minded!"
3108,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,He eats up little boys!
3109,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Run, run! I hear him coming from the mountains,"
3110,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"I know him by the noise!"""
3111,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3112,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""But we can't run, we are so faint and tired!"""
3113,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Hop-o'-my-Thumb began--
3114,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""'Tis all the same whether the wolves shall eat us,"
3115,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Or your good gentleman."""
3116,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3117,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And so she took them in, fed them, and hid them"
3118,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,All underneath her bed;
3119,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And in a minute more they heard approaching,"
3120,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Tramp! tramp! an awful tread!
3121,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3122,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,It was the Ogre coming home; his supper
3123,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Was steaming nice and hot,--"
3124,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Two calves upon a spit, ten rabbits roasting,"
3125,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,A whole sheep in the pot.
3126,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3127,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"He banged the door wide open, sniffed and snorted,"
3128,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Then, in a dreadful voice,"
3129,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Roared out, while his poor wife stood by and trembled,"
3130,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""I smell seven little boys!"""
3131,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3132,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,In vain she told him 'twas the mutton scorching;
3133,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,The veal had browned too fast;
3134,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"He searched the house, peering around and under,"
3135,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And reached the bed at last,"
3136,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3137,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Then dragged them one by one out, fairly shouting"
3138,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"At little Hop-o'my-Thumb,"
3139,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Saying the lads would make, towards a dinner,"
3140,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Six mouthfuls and one crumb.
3141,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3142,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""O, leave them till to-morrow!"" cried the woman;"
3143,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""You've meat enough to-night."""
3144,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Well, so I have,"" he said, ""I'll wait a little."
3145,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Ah! ugh! they're plump and white."""
3146,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3147,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Now it so chanced the Ogre had seven daughters,"
3148,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And all slept in one bed,"
3149,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"In a large room, and each wore for a nightcap"
3150,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,A gold crown on her head.
3151,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3152,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And Hop-o'-my-Thumb, when all the house was quiet,"
3153,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Into their chamber crept,"
3154,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And the gold head-bands for himself and brothers
3155,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Stole from them while they slept.
3156,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3157,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Wicked and sly it was; he knew the Ogre
3158,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Would, no doubt, rise at dawn,"
3159,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And, being but half awake, would kill the children"
3160,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Who had no night-caps on.
3161,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3162,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And, sure enough, he did! He was so drowsy,"
3163,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And fogs so veiled the sun,"
3164,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"That, whetting up a huge, broad-bladed dagger,"
3165,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"He slew them, every one."
3166,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3167,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Then Hop-o'-my-Thumb, awakening his brothers,"
3168,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Whispered: ""Make haste and fly!"""
3169,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Without a word they did as they were bidden,"
3170,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"In twinkling of an eye,"
3171,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3172,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Out in the drizzly mist of a gray morning,"
3173,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Off through the chill and dew,"
3174,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And none too soon! Within an hour the Ogre
3175,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,His dreadful blunder knew.
3176,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3177,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Wife, fetch my seven-league boots at once!"" he shouted;"
3178,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""I'll catch the vipers yet!"""
3179,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,He stamped his feet into the magic leather
3180,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,With many a muttered threat;
3181,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3182,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And off he started, over hill and valley,"
3183,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Seven leagues at every stride;
3184,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"The children saw him like a giant shadow,"
3185,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,But they could only hide.
3186,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3187,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"He scoured the country, rumbling like a tempest;"
3188,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Far, near, they heard his roar,"
3189,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Until at last his seven-league feet grew tired,"
3190,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And he could go no more.
3191,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3192,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And down he lay to rest him for a minute--
3193,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,The day had grown so hot--
3194,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Close to a rock where lay the seven children,"
3195,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Although he knew it not.
3196,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3197,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Hop-o'-my-thumb spoke softly to his brothers:
3198,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"""Run! fast as ever you can,"
3199,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And leave me to take care of Mr. Ogre."""
3200,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And hurry-scurry they ran.
3201,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3202,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And Hop-o'-my-Thumb, creeping from out his crevice,"
3203,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,With greatest caution drew
3204,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,The Ogre's boots off (these would shrink or widen
3205,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Just as you wished them to),"
3206,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3207,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And put them on himself. Then he decided
3208,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,To hasten to the king;
3209,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And, as he traveled towards the royal palace,"
3210,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Each boot was like a wing.
3211,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3212,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,There was a war. The king had need of service
3213,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,In carrying the news.
3214,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"He heard his tale, and said, ""I'll use this fellow"
3215,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Who wears the magic shoes."""
3216,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3217,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"So little Hop-o'-my-Thumb made mints of money,"
3218,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,And his whole family
3219,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Lived very easy lives, and from his bounty"
3220,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Grew rich as rich could be.
3221,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3222,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"As for the Ogre, in his sleep he tumbled"
3223,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Down from that ledge of rock,"
3224,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And was so bumped and bruised he never rallied,"
3225,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,But perished from the shock.
3226,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,
3227,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"And Hop-o'-my-Thumb, whose influence in high places"
3228,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Was certain to prevail,"
3229,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,"Made the kind Ogress, who had hidden and fed them,"
3230,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,Duchess of Draggletail.
3231,HOP-O-MY-THUMB,

3259,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Have in the same fashion
3260,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Their heartfelt compassion
3261,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Shown thus--with their tears!
3262,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3263,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3264,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,A dying father in his arms
3265,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Two children did enfold.
3266,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The eldest one, a little boy,"
3267,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Was only three years old;
3268,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Even less than that had served to tint
3269,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The baby's head with gold.
3270,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3271,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The mother, too, lay ill to death,"

3273,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And to her darlings, that same hour,"
3274,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Her farewell blessing gave.
3275,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Father and mother--one in life--
3276,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Were laid in the same grave.
3277,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3278,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"But, ere the latest breath was drawn,"
3279,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The father's brother came--
3280,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Nearest of kin, upon whose love"
3281,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The orphaned ones had claim--
3282,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And he made oath to cherish them

3284,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3285,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The will devised three hundred pounds

3291,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3292,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"For if, by chance, they both should die,"

3296,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And, while he promised fair, he planned"

3298,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3299,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,A twelvemonth did his darksome mind
3300,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Plot for the dreadful deed.
3301,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Two brutal ruffians he hired
3302,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,To help him in his need;
3303,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And yet, so secret were his ways,"
3304,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,None knew to intercede.
3305,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3306,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"He formed a wily, plausive tale,"

3308,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"How the two children were to go,"
3309,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Under the best of care--
3310,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Two friends of his--for holiday

3312,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3313,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The horses stood before the gate,"
3314,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The ruffians twain astride;
3315,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And gay with scarlet girth and rein
3316,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"They started, side by side."
3317,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"O, blithe the babies' spirits were,"
3318,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,That they could have a ride!
3319,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3320,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"For every pretty sight they saw,"

3326,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3327,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Meanwhile each ruffian surly sat,"
3328,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,In dark and restless mood;
3329,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Little the prattlers, in their joy,"
3330,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Such silence understood,"
3331,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,As on through the warm early day
3332,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,They rode towards the wood.
3333,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3334,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"They reached the leafy wilderness,"
3335,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And then the way grew wild;
3336,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,But ever with new glee the babes
3337,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The gathering gloom beguiled.
3338,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Until, at last, quite cheered and won,"
3339,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,One of the ruffians smiled.
3340,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3341,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Love had o'ercome within his breast
3342,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,His wicked avarice.
3343,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""I will not kill the little things,"""
3344,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"He said, ""for any price!"""
3345,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Then passed hot words between the two,"
3346,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"But only once or twice,"
3347,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3348,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"For blows fell, and the kindly one"
3349,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Dropped to the earth and died;
3350,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The children sank upon the ground,"
3351,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Trembling and terrified,"
3352,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And clung together, wondering,"
3353,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And moaned, and sobbed, and cried."
3354,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3355,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Then he who lived led them away,"
3356,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Both shivering with dread;
3357,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,They begged for food; he paused a space;
3358,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""Stay here awhile,"" he said,"
3359,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""And I will go into the town"
3360,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"At once, and fetch you bread."""
3361,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3362,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,He went. In their sweet innocence
3363,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,They trusted to his word;
3364,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Meanwhile, the sparkling morning sun"
3365,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,With a grey cloud was blurred;
3366,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And long, in vain, they waited there,"
3367,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Nor cried again, nor stirred!"
3368,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3369,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,How can I write the mournful end--
3370,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And tell how, up and down,"
3371,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"At last, by hunger driven, they stray"
3372,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Over the mosses brown--
3373,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"She clutching at his little coat,"
3374,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,He clinging to her gown?
3375,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3376,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"More than one day--more than one night,"
3377,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Comes on them there alone!
3378,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"They search for blackberries, so weak"
3379,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And starving they are grown,"
3380,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Now through a thicket of wild brier,"
3381,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Now 'gainst a hindering stone!
3382,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
3383,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Then they lie down to die, poor babes!"
3384,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The cruel ground receives
3385,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Their little bodies as a bed;
3386,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Long time the south wind grieves
3387,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Above them; and a hovering bough
3388,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,A pall of shadow weaves;
3389,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And robin-red-breasts pity them,"
3390,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And cover them with leaves!

3401,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Were those three sons,"
3402,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Each wearing always, without fail,"
3403,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,A little fanciful knot in his tail.
3404,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3405,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But never enough of sour or sweet
3406,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Had they to eat;
3407,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And so, one day, with a piteous squeak,"
3408,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Did the mother speak:
3409,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""My sons, your fortune you must seek!"""
3410,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And out in the world, as they were sent,"
3411,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The three pigs went.
3412,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3413,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Trotting along, the first one saw"

3415,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Give me some straw for a house and bed,"""
3416,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The little pig said.
3417,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Straightway, not even waiting a bit,"
3418,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The kind man did as he was bid;
3419,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And the little pig built a house of it.
3420,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3421,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But he was no more than settled, before"
3422,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"A wolf came along and knocked at the door,"
3423,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Tap-tap, and cried,"
3424,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"""
3425,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the pig replied,"
3426,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""No, no, by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!"""
3427,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The old wolf grumbled, and added beside,"
3428,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"""
3429,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3430,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was gray and big,"
3431,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in,"
3432,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And he ate up the poor little pig.
3433,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3434,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The very next day,"
3435,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"All blithe and gay,"
3436,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The second little pig went marching away
3437,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,To the world to find his fortune. And when
3438,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He met two men,"
3439,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Who bore on their shoulders bunches of furze,"

3442,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The little pig said.
3443,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"They gave it him freely, every whit,"
3444,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And the little pig built a house of it.
3445,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3446,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But he could no more than get in before
3447,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The wolf came along and knocked at the door:
3448,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"""
3449,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the pig replied,"
3450,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""No, no, by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!"""

3452,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"""
3453,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3454,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was fierce and big,"

3456,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he puffed and he huffed,"
3457,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he blew the house in,"
3458,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And he ate up the poor little pig.
3459,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3460,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And then the third little pig went out,"
3461,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"With his curly tail and his saucy snout,"
3462,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Up to all kinds of pranks and tricks;
3463,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he met a man with a load of bricks,"

3466,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3467,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"By the begging he got them every one,"
3468,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And in a trice
3469,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Was the house begun,"
3470,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And very shortly the house was done,"
3471,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Plastered and snug and nice.
3472,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3473,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And along came the same wolf as before,"
3474,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And knocked at the door,"
3475,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Thump, thump, and cried,"
3476,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"""
3477,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the pig replied,"
3478,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""No, no, by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!"""
3479,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Then the wolf filled his cheeks out on each side,"
3480,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Like a bellows, to blow,"
3481,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he howled, ""O ho!"

3483,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3484,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Well, he huffed and he puffed and he huffed,"
3485,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he puffed and he huffed and he puffed,"
3486,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But with all his huffing,"
3487,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And all his puffing,"
3488,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The house would _not_ fall in!
3489,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3490,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And so, despite"
3491,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"His appetite,"
3492,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was forced to go with never a bite,"
3493,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And for once, at least, was cheated out"
3494,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Of the little pig with the saucy snout.
3495,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3496,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Of the wily kind,"
3497,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Though, he was, and he whined,"
3498,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""I know, little pig, where we can find"

3500,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""O, over at Smith's, in his home field--"
3501,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,It's not far there.
3502,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,If it's pleasant weather
3503,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Shall we go together
3504,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"To-morrow at six?"" ""Yes,"" piggie squealed."
3505,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3506,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But what should the little pig contrive
3507,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But to rise at five
3508,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Next day, and to go through the early dew"
3509,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,To the field where the turnips grew;
3510,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"They were plenty and sweet,"
3511,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he ate of them all he cared to eat,"
3512,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And took enough for his dinner, and then"
3513,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Went home again.
3514,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3515,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The wolf came promptly at six o'clock,"
3516,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Gave a friendly knock,"
3517,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And asked the pig, ""Are you ready to go?"""
3518,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""Why, I'd have you know"
3519,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"I've already been there, and beside"
3520,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"I've enough for dinner,"" the pig replied."
3521,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3522,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The wolf saw then
3523,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,He was cheated again;
3524,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But, ""I know where's a lovely apple tree,"""
3525,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,In a winsome voice said he.
3526,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And the wise little pig, from where he sat,"
3527,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Peered out and smiled, ""Where's that?"""
3528,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""At the Merry Garden; if you'll be fair,"
3529,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And it's pleasant weather,"
3530,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,We two together
3531,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"At five in the morning will go there."""
3532,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3533,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Ah, sly and cunning"
3534,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The little pig was, for as early as four"
3535,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was out next day, and running, running,"
3536,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Hoping to get the apples before
3537,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The wolf was up. But the apple-tree
3538,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Proved twice as far as he thought 'twould be.
3539,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3540,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He climbed the boughs in the greatest haste,"
3541,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And thought to himself, ""I'll only taste,"
3542,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"As a bit of a lunch."""
3543,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But soon, crunch, crunch,"
3544,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,He had eaten a score--then what should he see
3545,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But the big gray wolf just under the tree!
3546,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3547,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Yes, there he stood,"
3548,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Trying to look as meek as he could,"
3549,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he said, ""Little pig, are the apples good?"""
3550,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Pig thought he should fall from where he sat,"
3551,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,So heavy his heart went pit-a-pat.
3552,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But he answered, ""The nicest under the sun!"
3553,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"I'll throw down one!"""
3554,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3555,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The wolf ran after it as he threw it,"
3556,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And, before he knew it,"
3557,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The pig was out of the tree, and as fleet"
3558,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,As his four little feet
3559,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Could scamper he fled,"
3560,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"On, into his house, while after him sped"
3561,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The wolf, with a savage voice and face,"
3562,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,In a furious chase.
3563,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was long and slim,"
3564,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But the little pig proved too swift for him.
3565,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3566,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Still, he came again the very next day,"
3567,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he knocked and called ""Little pig, I pray,"
3568,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,You will go to the Shanklin Fair with me.
3569,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Be ready, and I will call at three!"""
3570,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3571,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Now the pig, as he had always done,"
3572,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Got the start of the wolf, and went at one."
3573,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"At the fair he bought him a butter churn,"
3574,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And with it started out to return;
3575,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But who should he meet--
3576,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,The very first one he chanced to spy--
3577,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Upon the street,"
3578,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,But the wolf! and it frightened him dreadfully.
3579,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3580,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,So he crept inside
3581,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,His churn to hide;
3582,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,It began to roll; he began to ride;
3583,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Around and around,"
3584,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Along the ground,"
3585,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,He passed the wolf with a bump and bound.
3586,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3587,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He was frightened worse than he'd frightened the pig,"
3588,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"By the funny, rumbling rig;"
3589,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And he fled in dismay
3590,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Far out of his own and the little pig's way.
3591,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3592,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Yet in due time--for I suppose
3593,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,He was nearly starved--his pattering toes
3594,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Were heard again at the little pig's door.
3595,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Such a haunted look his visage wore,"
3596,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,When the tale he told
3597,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Of the beast that bumped and bounded and rolled,"
3598,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Up hill, down hill, and everywhere,"
3599,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And chased him away from the Shanklin Fair!
3600,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3601,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Then, with all his might,"
3602,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"The little pig laughed outright,"
3603,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Giving a jocular, scornful shout"
3604,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"With his saucy snout,"
3605,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"As he cried, ""O, how would you like to learn"
3606,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"'Twas a churn, and that I was in the churn!"""
3607,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3608,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Then the wolf exclaimed, ""I hate your tricks,"
3609,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Your bolted door and your house of bricks!
3610,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,I'll eat you anyway--that I'll do!
3611,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"I'll come down the chimney after you!"""
3612,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3613,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But the pig built a fire, high and hot,"
3614,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And filled with water his dinner pot,"
3615,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And just as the wolf came down the flue,"
3616,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Scraping his ribs as he slipped through,"
3617,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,What did he do
3618,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"But lift the cover, and let him fall"
3619,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Into the pot--hide, hair and all!"
3620,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3621,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,And what next he did
3622,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,Was to slide the lid
3623,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"Quick over the pot; ""It's boiling hot--"
3624,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"It'll maybe cook him, and maybe not,"""
3625,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"He cried in glee,"
3626,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"""But I'll let him be,"
3627,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And when it is dinner-time I'll see!"""
3628,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,
3629,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,That day he dined quite to his mind;
3630,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"And he mused to himself, ""I'm half inclined"
3631,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"To think, by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin,"
3632,THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,"That _this_ is the best way to take wolves in!"""

3641,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3642,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Two-Shoes, Two-Shoes,"
3643,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Little Goody Two-Shoes!
3644,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Do you know about her? Well,"
3645,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,I'm ready now to tell
3646,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,How the little creature came
3647,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,By so odd a name.
3648,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3649,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"It was very long ago,"
3650,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"In the days of good Queen Bess,"
3651,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"When upon the cold world's care,"
3652,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Fatherless and motherless,"
3653,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3654,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"There were thrown two helpless ones,"
3655,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Destitute as they could be;
3656,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Tom, they called the little boy,"
3657,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And the girl was Margery.
3658,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3659,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Many a day they cried for food
3660,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,When the cup-board shelves were bare;
3661,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Many an hour they roamed the streets
3662,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Scarcely knowing why or where.
3663,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3664,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"As to kindred, all were dead;"
3665,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"As to shelter, they had none;"
3666,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"As to shoes, Tom had a pair;"
3667,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Little Margery had but one!
3668,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3669,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"One-Shoe, One-Shoe,"
3670,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Think of Little One-Shoe!
3671,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Think how never a pretty boot
3672,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Was buttoned on the tender foot;
3673,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Nor yet a slipper, fairy-light,"
3674,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,With dainty knot or buckle bright!
3675,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3676,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,But above our human woes
3677,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Bends an always loving Heaven;
3678,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And to every hungry cry
3679,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Is there somewhere answer given.
3680,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3681,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Kind eyes watched the wandering ones,"
3682,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Pitied their forlorn distress;
3683,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Grieved to note Tom's ragged coat,"
3684,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And Margery's tattered dress.
3685,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3686,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"'Twas the village clergyman,"
3687,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And he sought them tenderly,"
3688,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Gave them warm, soft clothes to wear."
3689,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Ordered shoes for Margery.
3690,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3691,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"""Two shoes, two shoes,"
3692,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Oh, see my two shoes!"""
3693,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"So did little Margery cry,"
3694,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,When the cobbler came to try
3695,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,If they fitted trim and neat
3696,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,On the worn and tired feet:
3697,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,That is how and why she came
3698,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,By so strange a name.
3699,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3700,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Tom went off to London town;
3701,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Margery went to village school;
3702,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Apt she was, and quick to learn,"
3703,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Docile to the simplest rule.
3704,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3705,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Out from the long alphabet
3706,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Letters looked at her and smiled,"
3707,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Almost seemed to nod and speak,"
3708,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Glad to know so bright a child,"
3709,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3710,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Ranged themselves in winsome words;
3711,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Then in sentences. Indeed,"
3712,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Quite before she knew the fact,"
3713,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Margery had learned to read.
3714,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3715,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Two-Shoes, Two-Shoes,"
3716,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Eager Goody Two-Shoes!
3717,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"When the magic art she knew,"
3718,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,She planned to help poor children too;
3719,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And those who had no chance to learn
3720,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Their letters, she would teach in turn."
3721,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3722,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Now, in the days of good Queen Bess,"
3723,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Few books were printed, very few--"
3724,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"None, scarcely, for the little folks;"
3725,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,So Margery studied what to do.
3726,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3727,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,She cut from proper blocks of wood
3728,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Sets of the letters: A, B, C;"
3729,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And in some cosy shady place
3730,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Would group the children round her knee
3731,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3732,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And teach them--not alone to read,"
3733,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"But how to spell, and how to sing;"
3734,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And how to practice gentle ways,"
3735,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And to be kind to everything.
3736,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3737,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Two-Shoes, Two-Shoes,"
3738,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,So grew Goody Two-Shoes!
3739,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"First a maiden, comely, sweet;"
3740,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Then a woman, wise, discreet;"
3741,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Called now, as a courtesy,"
3742,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Little Mrs. Margery.
3743,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3744,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"An honored, faithful teacher she!"
3745,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And every year an added grace,"
3746,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"More fair than youth's fair roses are,"
3747,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Blossomed upon her charming face.
3748,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3749,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,All living things seemed drawn to her:
3750,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"A helpless lamb, whose dam had died,"
3751,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,She reared and tended till he ran
3752,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Tame as a kitten at her side;
3753,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3754,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,A sky-lark stolen from its nest
3755,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Sang on her finger, though he knew"
3756,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,His unclipped wings were free to soar
3757,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,At will into the heaven's blue;
3758,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3759,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,A raven which had fought and torn
3760,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Its captor's hand with savage beak,"
3761,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And which at first could only croak,"
3762,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,She taught in gracious words to speak;
3763,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3764,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Jumper, the dog, watched all her steps"
3765,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,With constant eyes and jealous love;
3766,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,A great cat purred and rubbed her dress;
3767,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And on her shoulder perched a dove.
3768,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3769,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Two-Shoes, Two-Shoes,"
3770,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Ah me, Margery Two-Shoes!"
3771,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Maybe the days of good Queen Bess
3772,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Were times of wisdom; nevertheless,"
3773,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Witches (the people said) might be--
3774,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,And a witch they thought our Margery!
3775,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3776,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"'Twas Nickey Noodle, a simpleton,"
3777,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Who raised the cry, ""A witch, a witch!"""
3778,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Then she was summoned to the court,"
3779,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Amused, or grieved, she scarce knew which."
3780,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3781,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Plenty of friends, however, proved"
3782,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,How false was Justice Shallow's plea
3783,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"That ""She _must_ be a witch, because--"
3784,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Because of the raven, don't you see?"""
3785,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3786,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Sir Edward Lovell, a baronet,"
3787,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Who stood in court and saw her grace
3788,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Her sweet good sense, her dignity,"
3789,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And the pure beauty of her face,"
3790,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3791,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Sighed heavily in his high-born breast
3792,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"As Mrs. Margery was set free,"
3793,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"Saying, ""I _know_ she is a witch,"
3794,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"For, ah, she so bewitches me!"""
3795,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3796,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"He watched her go her quiet ways,"
3797,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And vowed, whatever might betide,"
3798,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,If his best love could win her heart
3799,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"And hand, then she should be his bride."

3807,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,
3808,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,"What her answer, all may guess,"
3809,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,For the old church chime that rung
3810,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,Its next wedding anthem sung
3811,GOODY TWO-SHOES.,With a most delighted tongue:
