138,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"I heard along the early hills,"
139,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"Ere yet the lark was risen up,"
140,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
141,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--"
142,THE FAIRIES DANCING,I heard the fairies in a ring
143,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Sing as they tripped a lilting round
144,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
145,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"The starlight shook as if with sound,"
146,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"As if with echoing, and the stars"
147,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams
148,THE FAIRIES DANCING,While red with war the gusty Mars
149,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
150,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"He shone alone, low down the West,"
151,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,"
152,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
153,THE FAIRIES DANCING,The fires of the morning flush.
154,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"Till, as a mist, their beauty died,"
155,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
156,THE FAIRIES DANCING,And daylight tremulous and wide
157,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Flooded the moorland through and through;
158,THE FAIRIES DANCING,Till Urdon's copper weathercock
159,THE FAIRIES DANCING,"Was reared in golden flame afar,"
160,THE FAIRIES DANCING,And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
161,THE FAIRIES DANCING,The towers and groves of Arroar.

214,THE DOUBLE,
215,THE DOUBLE,
216,THE DOUBLE,I curtseyed to the dovecote.
217,THE DOUBLE,I curtseyed to the well.
218,THE DOUBLE,"I twirled me round and round about,"
219,THE DOUBLE,The morning sweets to smell.
220,THE DOUBLE,"When out I came from spinning so,"
221,THE DOUBLE,"Lo, betwixt green and blue"
222,THE DOUBLE,Was the ghost of me--a Fairy Child--
223,THE DOUBLE,"A-dancing--dancing, too."
224,THE DOUBLE,
225,THE DOUBLE,Nought was of her wearing
226,THE DOUBLE,That is the earth's array.
227,THE DOUBLE,Her thistledown feet beat airy fleet
228,THE DOUBLE,Yet set no blade astray.
229,THE DOUBLE,The gossamer shining dews of June
230,THE DOUBLE,Showed grey against the green;
231,THE DOUBLE,Yet never so much as a bird-claw print
232,THE DOUBLE,Of footfall to be seen.
233,THE DOUBLE,
234,THE DOUBLE,Fading in the mounting sun
235,THE DOUBLE,That image soon did pine.
236,THE DOUBLE,Fainter than moonlight thinned the locks
237,THE DOUBLE,That shone as clear as mine.
238,THE DOUBLE,"Vanished! Vanished! O, sad it is"
239,THE DOUBLE,To spin and spin--in vain;
240,THE DOUBLE,And never to see the ghost of me
241,THE DOUBLE,A-dancing there again.

251,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
252,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
253,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Rare-sweet the air in that unimagined country--
254,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,My spirit had wandered far
255,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,From its weary body close-enwrapt in slumber
256,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Where its home and earth-friends are;
257,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,A milk-like air--and of light all abundance;
258,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,And there a river clear
259,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Painting the scene like a picture on its bosom,"
260,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Green foliage drifting near.
261,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
262,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"No sign of life I saw, as I pressed onward,"
263,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Fish, nor beast, nor bird,"
264,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Till I came to a hill clothed in flowers to its summit,"
265,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Then shrill small voices I heard.
266,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
267,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,And I saw from concealment a company of elf-folk
268,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"With faces strangely fair,"
269,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Talking their unearthly scattered talk together,"
270,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"A bind of green-grasses in their hair,"
271,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
272,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Marvellously gentle, feater far than children,"
273,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"In gesture, mien and speech,"
274,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Hastening onward in translucent shafts of sunshine,"
275,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,And gossiping each with each.
276,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
277,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Straw-light their locks, on neck and shoulder falling,"
278,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Faint of almond the silks they wore,"
279,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Spun not of worm, but as if inwoven of moonbeams"
280,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,And foam on rock-bound shore;
281,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
282,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Like lank-legged grasshoppers in June-tide meadows,"
283,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Amalillios of the day,"
284,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Hungrily gazed upon by me--a stranger,"
285,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,In unknown regions astray.
286,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
287,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Yet, happy beyond words, I marked their sunlit faces,"
288,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Stealing soft enchantment from their eyes,"
289,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Tears in my own confusing their small image,"
290,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Harkening their bird-like cries.
291,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
292,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"They passed me, unseeing, a waft of flocking linnets;"
293,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Sadly I fared on my way;
294,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"And came in my dream to a dreamlike habitation,"
295,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Close-shut, festooned and grey."
296,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
297,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Pausing, I gazed at the porch dust-still, vine-wreathèd,"
298,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Worn the stone steps thereto,"
299,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,"Mute hung its bell, whence a stony head looked downward,"
300,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Grey 'gainst the sky's pale-blue--
301,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,
302,THE UNFINISHED DREAM,Strange to me: strange....

311,THE HORN,In cloudland winding sweet--
312,THE HORN,"And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,"
313,THE HORN,And silver-shod light feet?
314,THE HORN,
315,THE HORN,Is it the elfin laughter
316,THE HORN,"Of fairies riding faint and high,"
317,THE HORN,"Beneath the branches of the moon,"
318,THE HORN,Straying through the starry sky?
319,THE HORN,
320,THE HORN,Is it in the globèd dew
321,THE HORN,Such sweet melodies may fall?
322,THE HORN,"Wood and valley--all are still,"
323,THE HORN,Hushed the shepherd's call.

335,THE THREE BEGGARS,"'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,"
336,THE THREE BEGGARS,"While past St. Ann's grey tower they shuffled,"
337,THE THREE BEGGARS,Three beggars spied a fairy-child
338,THE THREE BEGGARS,In crimson mantle muffled.
339,THE THREE BEGGARS,
340,THE THREE BEGGARS,The daybreak lighted up her face
341,THE THREE BEGGARS,"All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;"
342,THE THREE BEGGARS,"She looked on them a little space,"
343,THE THREE BEGGARS,And shrill as hautboy cried:--
344,THE THREE BEGGARS,
345,THE THREE BEGGARS,"""O three tall footsore men of rags"
346,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Which walking this gold morn I see,"
347,THE THREE BEGGARS,What will ye give me from your bags
348,THE THREE BEGGARS,"For fairy kisses three?"""
349,THE THREE BEGGARS,
350,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The first, that was a reddish man,"
351,THE THREE BEGGARS,Out of his bundle takes a crust:
352,THE THREE BEGGARS,"""La, by the tombstones of St. Ann,"

355,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The second, that was a chestnut man,"
356,THE THREE BEGGARS,Out of his bundle draws a bone:
357,THE THREE BEGGARS,"""Lo, by the belfry of St. Ann,"
358,THE THREE BEGGARS,"And all my breakfast gone!"""
359,THE THREE BEGGARS,
360,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The third, that was a yellow man,"
361,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Out of his bundle picks a groat,"
362,THE THREE BEGGARS,"""La, by the Angel of St. Ann,"
363,THE THREE BEGGARS,"And I must go without."""
364,THE THREE BEGGARS,
365,THE THREE BEGGARS,"That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,"
366,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!"
367,THE THREE BEGGARS,Beneath her finger taper-tipped
368,THE THREE BEGGARS,The magic all ran through.
369,THE THREE BEGGARS,
370,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Instead of crust a peacock pie,"
371,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Instead of bone sweet venison,"
372,THE THREE BEGGARS,Instead of groat a white lily
373,THE THREE BEGGARS,With seven blooms thereon.
374,THE THREE BEGGARS,
375,THE THREE BEGGARS,And each fair cup was deep with wine:
376,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Such was the changeling's charity,"
377,THE THREE BEGGARS,"The sweet feast was enough for nine,"
378,THE THREE BEGGARS,But not too much for three.
379,THE THREE BEGGARS,
380,THE THREE BEGGARS,O toothsome meat in jelly froze!
381,THE THREE BEGGARS,O tender haunch of elfin stag!
382,THE THREE BEGGARS,O rich the odour that arose!
383,THE THREE BEGGARS,O plump with scraps each bag!
384,THE THREE BEGGARS,
385,THE THREE BEGGARS,"There, in the daybreak gold and wild,"
386,THE THREE BEGGARS,Each merry-hearted beggar man
387,THE THREE BEGGARS,"Drank deep unto the fairy child,"
388,THE THREE BEGGARS,And blessed the good St. Ann.

394,THE STRANGER,
395,THE STRANGER,
396,THE STRANGER,In the nook of a wood where a pool freshed with dew
397,THE STRANGER,"Glassed, daybreak till evening, blue sky glimpsing through"
398,THE STRANGER,"Then a star; or a slip of May-moon silver-white,"
399,THE STRANGER,"Thridding softly aloof the quiet of night,"
400,THE STRANGER,Was a thicket of flowers.
401,THE STRANGER,
402,THE STRANGER,"Willow herb, mint, pale speedwell and rattle"
403,THE STRANGER,Water hemlock and sundew--to the wind's tittle-tattle
404,THE STRANGER,"They nodded, dreamed, swayed in jocund delight,"
405,THE STRANGER,"In beauty and sweetness arrayed, still and bright."
406,THE STRANGER,By turn scampered rabbit; trotted fox; bee and bird
407,THE STRANGER,"Paused droning, sang shrill, and the fair water stirred."
408,THE STRANGER,"Plashed green frog, or some brisk little flickering fish--"
409,THE STRANGER,"Gudgeon, stickleback, minnow--set the ripples a-swish."
410,THE STRANGER,
411,THE STRANGER,"A lone pool, a pool grass-fringed, crystal-clear:"
412,THE STRANGER,"Deep, placid, and cool in the sweet of the year;"
413,THE STRANGER,Edge-parched when the sun to the Dog Days drew near;
414,THE STRANGER,"And with winter's bleak rime hard as glass, robed in snow,"
415,THE STRANGER,"The whole wild-wood sleeping, and nothing a-blow"
416,THE STRANGER,But the wind from the North--bringing snow.
417,THE STRANGER,
418,THE STRANGER,"That is all. Save that one long, sweet, June night-tide straying,"
419,THE STRANGER,The harsh hemlock's pale umbelliferous bloom
420,THE STRANGER,"Tenting nook, dense with fragrance and secret with gloom,"
421,THE STRANGER,"In a beaming of moon-colored light faintly raying,"
422,THE STRANGER,"On buds orbed with dew phosphorescently playing,"
423,THE STRANGER,"Came a Stranger--still-footed, feat-fingered, clear face"
424,THE STRANGER,Unhumanly lovely: ... and supped in that place.

489,SLEEPYHEAD,"Sleepyhead,"
490,SLEEPYHEAD,"Put your white foot, now;"
491,SLEEPYHEAD,Here are we
492,SLEEPYHEAD,Beneath the tree
493,SLEEPYHEAD,"Singing round the root now."""
494,SLEEPYHEAD,
495,SLEEPYHEAD,"I looked out of window, in the white moonlight,"
496,SLEEPYHEAD,The leaves were like snow in the wood--
497,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Come away,"
498,SLEEPYHEAD,"Child, and play"
499,SLEEPYHEAD,Light with the gnomies;
500,SLEEPYHEAD,"In a mound,"
501,SLEEPYHEAD,"Green and round,"
502,SLEEPYHEAD,That's where their home is.
503,SLEEPYHEAD,
504,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Honey sweet,"

523,SLEEPYHEAD,[Illustration]
524,SLEEPYHEAD,
525,SLEEPYHEAD,
526,SLEEPYHEAD,"""I'm thinking and thinking,"" said old Sam Shore,"
527,SLEEPYHEAD,"""'Twere somebody _knocking_ I heard at the door."""
528,SLEEPYHEAD,
529,SLEEPYHEAD,"From the clock popped the cuckoo and cuckooed out eight,"
530,SLEEPYHEAD,As there in his chair he wondering sate ...
531,SLEEPYHEAD,"""There's no one I knows on would come so late,"
532,SLEEPYHEAD,A-clicking the latch of an empty house
533,SLEEPYHEAD,With nobbut inside 'un but me and a mouse....
534,SLEEPYHEAD,"Maybe a-waking in sleep I be,"
535,SLEEPYHEAD,"And 'twere out of a dream came that tapping to me."""
536,SLEEPYHEAD,"At length he cautiously rose, and went,"
537,SLEEPYHEAD,"And with thumb upon latch awhile listening bent,"
538,SLEEPYHEAD,Then slowly drew open the door. And behold!
539,SLEEPYHEAD,"There stood a Fairy!--all green and gold,"
540,SLEEPYHEAD,"Mantled up warm against dark and cold,"
541,SLEEPYHEAD,"And smiling up into his candle shine,"
542,SLEEPYHEAD,"Lips like wax, and cheeks like wine,"
543,SLEEPYHEAD,As saucy and winsome a thing to see
544,SLEEPYHEAD,As are linden buds on a linden tree.
545,SLEEPYHEAD,
546,SLEEPYHEAD,"Stock-still in the doorway stood simple Sam,"
547,SLEEPYHEAD,"A-ducking his head, with ""Good-e'en to 'ee, Ma'am."""
548,SLEEPYHEAD,
549,SLEEPYHEAD,"Dame Fairy she nods, and cries clear and sweet,"
550,SLEEPYHEAD,"""'Tis a _very_ good-e'en, sir, when such folks meet."
551,SLEEPYHEAD,"I know thee, Sam, thou though wist not of me,"
552,SLEEPYHEAD,And I'm come in late gloaming to speak with thee;
553,SLEEPYHEAD,"Though my eyes do dazzle at glint of your rush,"
554,SLEEPYHEAD,"All under this pretty green fuchsia bush."""
555,SLEEPYHEAD,
556,SLEEPYHEAD,"Sam ducked once more, smiling simple and slow."
557,SLEEPYHEAD,"Like the warbling of birds her words did flow,"
558,SLEEPYHEAD,"And she laughed, very merry, to see how true"
559,SLEEPYHEAD,Shone the old man's kindness his courtesy through.
560,SLEEPYHEAD,"And she nodded her head, and the stars on high"
561,SLEEPYHEAD,Sparkled down on her smallness from out of the sky.
562,SLEEPYHEAD,
563,SLEEPYHEAD,"""A friend is a friend, Sam, and wonderful pleasant,"
564,SLEEPYHEAD,And I'm come for old sake's sake to bring thee a present.
565,SLEEPYHEAD,"Three wishes, three wishes are thine, Sam Shore,"
566,SLEEPYHEAD,"Just three wishes--and wish no more,"
567,SLEEPYHEAD,"All for because, ruby-ripe to see,"
568,SLEEPYHEAD,"The pixy-pears burn in yon hawthorn tree,"
569,SLEEPYHEAD,"And your old milch cow, wheresoever she goes"
570,SLEEPYHEAD,Never crops over the fairy-knowes.
571,SLEEPYHEAD,"Ay, Sam, thou art old and thy house is lone,"
572,SLEEPYHEAD,"But there's Potencies round thee, and here is one!"""
573,SLEEPYHEAD,
574,SLEEPYHEAD,"Poor Sam, he stared: and the star o'erhead"
575,SLEEPYHEAD,A shimmering light on the elm-tops shed.
576,SLEEPYHEAD,"Like rilling of water her voice rang sweet,"
577,SLEEPYHEAD,And the night-wind sighed at the sound of it.
578,SLEEPYHEAD,"He frowned--glanced back at the empty grate,"
579,SLEEPYHEAD,And shook very slowly his grey old pate:
580,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Three wishes, my dear! Why, I scarcely knows"
581,SLEEPYHEAD,Which be my crany and which my toes!
582,SLEEPYHEAD,"But I thank 'ee, Ma'am, kindly, and this I'd say,"
583,SLEEPYHEAD,That the night of your passing is Michaelmas Day;
584,SLEEPYHEAD,"And if it were company come on a sudden,"
585,SLEEPYHEAD,"Why, I'd ax for a fat goose to fry in the oven!"""
586,SLEEPYHEAD,
587,SLEEPYHEAD,"And lo, and forsooth! as the words he was uttering,"
588,SLEEPYHEAD,"A rich puff of air set his candle a-guttering,"
589,SLEEPYHEAD,"And there rose in the kitchen a sizzling and sputtering,"
590,SLEEPYHEAD,"With a crackling of sparks and of flames a great fluttering,"
591,SLEEPYHEAD,And--of which here could not be two opinions--
592,SLEEPYHEAD,A smoking-hot savour of sage and onions.
593,SLEEPYHEAD,"Beam, wall and flagstones the kitchen was lit,"
594,SLEEPYHEAD,Every dark corner and cranny of it
595,SLEEPYHEAD,With the blaze from the hearthstone. Copper and brass
596,SLEEPYHEAD,Winked back the winking of platter and glass.
597,SLEEPYHEAD,And a wonderful squeaking of mice went up
598,SLEEPYHEAD,At the smell of a Michaelmas supper to sup--
599,SLEEPYHEAD,Unctuous odours that wreathed and swirled
600,SLEEPYHEAD,"Where'er frisked a whisker or mouse-tail twirled,"
601,SLEEPYHEAD,While out of the chimney up into the night
602,SLEEPYHEAD,That ne'er-to-be-snuffed-too-much smoke took flight.
603,SLEEPYHEAD,"""That's one,"" says the Fairy, finger on thumb,"
604,SLEEPYHEAD,"""So now, Mister Sam, there's but two to come!"""
605,SLEEPYHEAD,"She leaned her head sidelong; she lifted her chin,"
606,SLEEPYHEAD,With a twinkling of eye from the radiance within.
607,SLEEPYHEAD,"Poor Sam stood astounded; he says, says he,"
608,SLEEPYHEAD,"""I _wish_ my old Mother was back with me,"
609,SLEEPYHEAD,For if there was one thing she couldn't refuse
610,SLEEPYHEAD,"'Twas a sweet thick slice from the breast of a goose."""
611,SLEEPYHEAD,"But his cheek grew stiff and his eyes stared bright,"
612,SLEEPYHEAD,"For there, on her stick, pushing out of the night,"
613,SLEEPYHEAD,"Tap-tapping along, herself and no other,"
614,SLEEPYHEAD,Came who but the shape of his dear old Mother!
615,SLEEPYHEAD,"Straight into the kitchen she hastened and went,"
616,SLEEPYHEAD,Her breath coming quick as if all but spent.
617,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Why, Sam,"" says she, ""the bird be turning,"
618,SLEEPYHEAD,"For my nose tells I that the skin's a-burning!"""
619,SLEEPYHEAD,And down at the oven the ghost of her sat
620,SLEEPYHEAD,And basted the goose with the boiling fat.
621,SLEEPYHEAD,
622,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Oho,"" cries the Fairy, sweet and small,"
623,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Another wish gone will leave nothing at all."""
624,SLEEPYHEAD,"And Sam sighs, ""Bless 'ee, Ma'am, keep the other,"
625,SLEEPYHEAD,"There's nowt that I want now I have my Mother."""
626,SLEEPYHEAD,"But the Fairy laughs softly, and says, says she,"
627,SLEEPYHEAD,"""There's one wish left, Sam, I promised 'ee three."
628,SLEEPYHEAD,"Hasten your wits, the hour creeps on,"
629,SLEEPYHEAD,There's calling afield and I'm soon to be gone.
630,SLEEPYHEAD,Soon as haps midnight the cocks will crow
631,SLEEPYHEAD,"And me to the gathering and feasting must go."""
632,SLEEPYHEAD,
633,SLEEPYHEAD,"Sam gazed at his Mother--withered and wan,"
634,SLEEPYHEAD,"The rose in her cheek, her bright hair, gone,"
635,SLEEPYHEAD,And her poor old back bent double with years--
636,SLEEPYHEAD,"And he scarce could speak for the salt, salt tears."
637,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Well, well,"" he says, ""I'm unspeakable glad:"
638,SLEEPYHEAD,But--it bain't quite the same as when I was a lad.
639,SLEEPYHEAD,"There's joy and there's joy, Ma'am, but to tell 'ee the truth"
640,SLEEPYHEAD,There's none can compare with the joy of one's youth.
641,SLEEPYHEAD,"And if it was possible, how could I choose"
642,SLEEPYHEAD,But be back in boy's breeches to eat the goose;
643,SLEEPYHEAD,"And all the old things--and my Mother the most,"
644,SLEEPYHEAD,To shine again real as my own gatepost.
645,SLEEPYHEAD,"What wouldn't I give, too, to see again wag"
646,SLEEPYHEAD,"The dumpity tail of my old dog, Shag!"
647,SLEEPYHEAD,"Your kindness, Ma'am, but all wishing was vain"
648,SLEEPYHEAD,"Unless us can both be young again."""
649,SLEEPYHEAD,"A shrill, faint laughter from nowhere came ..."
650,SLEEPYHEAD,Empty the dark in the candle-flame....
651,SLEEPYHEAD,
652,SLEEPYHEAD,"And there stood our Sam, about four foot high,"
653,SLEEPYHEAD,"Snub nose, shock hair, and round blue eye."
654,SLEEPYHEAD,"Breeches and braces and coat of him too,"
655,SLEEPYHEAD,"Shirt on his back, and each clodhopping shoe"
656,SLEEPYHEAD,Had shrunk to a nicety--button and hem
657,SLEEPYHEAD,To fit the small Sammie tucked up into them.
658,SLEEPYHEAD,
659,SLEEPYHEAD,"There was his Mother, too; smooth, dear cheek,"
660,SLEEPYHEAD,"Lips as smooth as a blackbird's beak,"
661,SLEEPYHEAD,"Pretty arched eyebrows, the daintiest nose--"
662,SLEEPYHEAD,While the smoke of the baking deliciously rose.
663,SLEEPYHEAD,
664,SLEEPYHEAD,"""Come, Sammie,"" she cries, ""your old Mammikin's joy,"
665,SLEEPYHEAD,"Climb up on your stool, supper's ready, my boy."
666,SLEEPYHEAD,"Bring in the candle, and shut out the night;"
667,SLEEPYHEAD,"There's goose, baked taties and cabbage to bite."
668,SLEEPYHEAD,"Why, bless the wee lamb, he's all shiver and shake,"
669,SLEEPYHEAD,And you'd think from the look of him scarcely awake!
670,SLEEPYHEAD,"If 'ee glour wi' those eyes, Sam, so dark and round,"
671,SLEEPYHEAD,"The elves will away with 'ee, I'll be bound!"""
672,SLEEPYHEAD,So Sam and his Mother by wishes three
673,SLEEPYHEAD,Were made just as happy as happy can be.
674,SLEEPYHEAD,And there--with a bumpity tail to wag--
675,SLEEPYHEAD,"Sat laughing, with tongue out, their old dog, Shag."
676,SLEEPYHEAD,"To clatter of patter, bones, giblets and juice,"
677,SLEEPYHEAD,Between them they ate up the whole of the goose.
678,SLEEPYHEAD,
679,SLEEPYHEAD,"But time is a river for ever in flow,"
680,SLEEPYHEAD,The weeks went by as the weeks must go.
681,SLEEPYHEAD,Soon fifty-two to a year did grow.
682,SLEEPYHEAD,"The long years passed, one after another,"
683,SLEEPYHEAD,Making older and older our Sam and his Mother;
684,SLEEPYHEAD,"And, alas and alack, with nine of them gone,"
685,SLEEPYHEAD,Poor Shag lay asleep again under a stone.
686,SLEEPYHEAD,And a sorrowful dread would sometimes creep
687,SLEEPYHEAD,"Into Sam's dreams, as he lay asleep,"
688,SLEEPYHEAD,"That his Mother was lost, and away he'd fare,"
689,SLEEPYHEAD,"Calling her, calling her, everywhere,"
690,SLEEPYHEAD,"In dark, in rain, by roads unknown,"
691,SLEEPYHEAD,"Under echoing hills, and alone, alone."
692,SLEEPYHEAD,What bliss in the morning to wake and see
693,SLEEPYHEAD,"The sun shining green in the linden tree,"
694,SLEEPYHEAD,And out of that dream's dark shadowiness
695,SLEEPYHEAD,"To slip in on his Mother and give her a kiss,"
696,SLEEPYHEAD,And go whistling off in the dew to hear
697,SLEEPYHEAD,"The thrushes all mocking him, sweet and clear."
698,SLEEPYHEAD,
699,SLEEPYHEAD,"Still, moon after moon from heaven above"
700,SLEEPYHEAD,"Shone on Mother and son, and made light of love."
701,SLEEPYHEAD,"Her roses faded, her pretty brown hair"
702,SLEEPYHEAD,Had sorrowful grey in it everywhere.
703,SLEEPYHEAD,"And at last she died, and was laid to rest,"
704,SLEEPYHEAD,Her tired hands crossed on her shrunken breast.
705,SLEEPYHEAD,"And Sam, now lonely, lived on and on"
706,SLEEPYHEAD,Till most of his workaday life seemed gone.
707,SLEEPYHEAD,
708,SLEEPYHEAD,"Yet spring came again with its green and blue,"
709,SLEEPYHEAD,"And presently summer's wild roses too,"
710,SLEEPYHEAD,"Pinks, Sweet William, and sops-in-wine,"
711,SLEEPYHEAD,"Blackberry, lavender, eglantine."
712,SLEEPYHEAD,"And when these had blossomed and gone their way,"
713,SLEEPYHEAD,"'Twas apples, and daisies and Michaelmas Day--"
714,SLEEPYHEAD,"Yes, spider-webs, dew, and haws in the may,"
715,SLEEPYHEAD,And seraphs singing in Michaelmas Day.
716,SLEEPYHEAD,
717,SLEEPYHEAD,Sam worked all morning and _couldn't_ get rest
718,SLEEPYHEAD,For a kind of a feeling of grief in his breast.
719,SLEEPYHEAD,"And yet, not grief, but something more"
720,SLEEPYHEAD,Like the thought that what happens has happened before.
721,SLEEPYHEAD,"He fed the chickens, he fed the sow,"
722,SLEEPYHEAD,"On a three-legged stool sate down to the cow,"
723,SLEEPYHEAD,"With a pail 'twixt his legs in the green in the meadow,"
724,SLEEPYHEAD,Under the elm trees' lengthening shadow;
725,SLEEPYHEAD,And woke at last with a smile and a sigh
726,SLEEPYHEAD,To find he had milked his poor Jingo dry.
727,SLEEPYHEAD,
728,SLEEPYHEAD,"As dusk set in, even the birds did seem"
729,SLEEPYHEAD,To be calling and calling from out of a dream.
730,SLEEPYHEAD,"He chopped up kindling, shut up his shed,"
731,SLEEPYHEAD,In a bucket of well-water soused his head
732,SLEEPYHEAD,To freshen his eyes up a little and make
733,SLEEPYHEAD,The drowsy old wits of him wider awake.
734,SLEEPYHEAD,As neat as a womanless creature is able
735,SLEEPYHEAD,He swept up his hearthstone and laid the table.
736,SLEEPYHEAD,"And then o'er his platter and mug, if you please,"
737,SLEEPYHEAD,Sate gloomily gooming at loaf and cheese--
738,SLEEPYHEAD,Gooming and gooming as if the mere sight
739,SLEEPYHEAD,Of his victuals could satisfy appetite!
740,SLEEPYHEAD,And the longer and longer he looked at them
741,SLEEPYHEAD,"The slimmer slimmed upward his candle flame,"
742,SLEEPYHEAD,Blue in the air. And when squeaked a mouse
743,SLEEPYHEAD,'Twas loud as a trump in the hush of the house.
744,SLEEPYHEAD,"Then, sudden, a soft little wind puffed by,"
745,SLEEPYHEAD,'Twixt the thick-thatched roof and the star-sown sky;
746,SLEEPYHEAD,And died. And then
747,SLEEPYHEAD,"That deep, dead, wonderful silence again."
748,SLEEPYHEAD,
749,SLEEPYHEAD,Then--soft as a rattle a-counting her seeds
750,SLEEPYHEAD,In the midst of a tangle of withered-up weeds--
751,SLEEPYHEAD,"Came a faint, faint knocking, a rustle like silk,"
752,SLEEPYHEAD,And a breath at the keyhole as soft as milk--
753,SLEEPYHEAD,Still as the flit of a moth. And then ...
754,SLEEPYHEAD,That infinitesimal knocking again.
755,SLEEPYHEAD,
756,SLEEPYHEAD,Sam lifted his chin from his fists. He listened.
757,SLEEPYHEAD,His wandering eyes in the candle glistened.
758,SLEEPYHEAD,"Then slowly, slowly, rolled round by degrees--"

1330,THE ISLE OF LONE,

1335,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1336,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Their house was small and sweet of the sea,"
1337,THE ISLE OF LONE,And pale as the Malmsey wine;

1340,THE ISLE OF LONE,

1345,THE ISLE OF LONE,

1347,THE ISLE OF LONE,For light beamed a gobbet of wax;
1348,THE ISLE OF LONE,There were three wooden stools for whatever they wore
1349,THE ISLE OF LONE,On their humpity-dumpity backs.
1350,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1351,THE ISLE OF LONE,So each would lie on a drowsy pillow
1352,THE ISLE OF LONE,And watch the moon in the sky--
1353,THE ISLE OF LONE,"And hear the parrot scream to the billow,"
1354,THE ISLE OF LONE,The billow roar reply:
1355,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1356,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Parrots of sapphire and sulphur and amber,"
1357,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Scarlet, and flame, and green,"
1358,THE ISLE OF LONE,"While five-foot apes did scramble and clamber,"
1359,THE ISLE OF LONE,In the feathery-tufted treen.
1360,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1361,THE ISLE OF LONE,All night long with bubbles a-glisten
1362,THE ISLE OF LONE,"The ocean cried under the moon,"

1366,THE ISLE OF LONE,Then from three small beds the dark hours' while
1367,THE ISLE OF LONE,In a house in the Island of Lone

1371,THE ISLE OF LONE,But soon as ever came peep of sun
1372,THE ISLE OF LONE,"On coral and feathery tree,"
1373,THE ISLE OF LONE,Three nightcapped dwarfs to the surf would run
1374,THE ISLE OF LONE,And soon were a-bob in the sea.
1375,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1376,THE ISLE OF LONE,"At six they went fishing, at nine they snared"
1377,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Young foxes in the dells,"
1378,THE ISLE OF LONE,"At noon on sweet berries and honey they fared,"
1379,THE ISLE OF LONE,And blew in their twisted shells.
1380,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1381,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Dark was the sea they gambolled in,"
1382,THE ISLE OF LONE,"And thick with silver fish,"
1383,THE ISLE OF LONE,Dark as green glass blown clear and thin
1384,THE ISLE OF LONE,To be a monarch's dish.
1385,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1386,THE ISLE OF LONE,"They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,"
1387,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Lit pale with flies of fire,"
1388,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,"
1389,THE ISLE OF LONE,And lemon their attire.
1390,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1391,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,"
1392,THE ISLE OF LONE,And golden honeycomb
1393,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Into their bowls of cream they dipped,"
1394,THE ISLE OF LONE,Whipt light and white as foam.
1395,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1396,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Now Alliolyle, where the sand-flower blows,"
1397,THE ISLE OF LONE,Taught three old apes to sing--
1398,THE ISLE OF LONE,Taught three old apes to dance on their toes
1399,THE ISLE OF LONE,And caper around in a ring.
1400,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1401,THE ISLE OF LONE,"They yelled them hoarse and they croaked them sweet,"
1402,THE ISLE OF LONE,"They twirled them about and around,"
1403,THE ISLE OF LONE,"To the noise of their voices they danced with their feet,"
1404,THE ISLE OF LONE,They stamped with their feet on the ground.
1405,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1406,THE ISLE OF LONE,"But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,"
1407,THE ISLE OF LONE,"His parrot on his thumb,"
1408,THE ISLE OF LONE,"And the twain they scritched in mockery,"
1409,THE ISLE OF LONE,While the dancers go and come.
1410,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1411,THE ISLE OF LONE,"And, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,"
1412,THE ISLE OF LONE,Light-haired Lallerie
1413,THE ISLE OF LONE,Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle
1414,THE ISLE OF LONE,By the yellow-sanded sea.
1415,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1416,THE ISLE OF LONE,The rising moon swam sweet and large
1417,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Before their furious eyes,"
1418,THE ISLE OF LONE,And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge
1419,THE ISLE OF LONE,Where the surf for ever cries.
1420,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1421,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:"
1422,THE ISLE OF LONE,Clear in the clear green sea
1423,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Alliolyle lies not alone,"
1424,THE ISLE OF LONE,But clasped with Lallerie.
1425,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1426,THE ISLE OF LONE,He blows on his shell plaintive notes;
1427,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Ape, parraquito, bee"
1428,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--"
1429,THE ISLE OF LONE,The shoe of Lallerie.
1430,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1431,THE ISLE OF LONE,"He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,"
1432,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Grey apes he dowers three,"
1433,THE ISLE OF LONE,His house as fair as the Malmsey wine
1434,THE ISLE OF LONE,Seems sad as cypress-tree.
1435,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1436,THE ISLE OF LONE,Three bowls he brims with sweet honeycomb
1437,THE ISLE OF LONE,"To feast the bumble bees,"
1438,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Saying, ""O bees, be this your home,"
1439,THE ISLE OF LONE,"For grief is on the seas!"""
1440,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1441,THE ISLE OF LONE,"He sate him lone in a coral grot,"
1442,THE ISLE OF LONE,At the flowing in of the tide;
1443,THE ISLE OF LONE,"When ebbed the billow, there was not,"
1444,THE ISLE OF LONE,"Save coral, aught beside."
1445,THE ISLE OF LONE,
1446,THE ISLE OF LONE,"So hairy apes in three white beds,"
1447,THE ISLE OF LONE,"And nightcaps, one and nine,"
1448,THE ISLE OF LONE,On moonlit pillows lay three heads
1449,THE ISLE OF LONE,Bemused with dwarfish wine.

2064,THE JOURNEY,
2065,THE JOURNEY,Heart-sick of his journey was the Wanderer;
2066,THE JOURNEY,Footsore and parched was he;
2067,THE JOURNEY,"And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,"
2068,THE JOURNEY,Looked out of sorcery.
2069,THE JOURNEY,
2070,THE JOURNEY,"""Lift up your eyes, you lonely Wanderer,"""
2071,THE JOURNEY,She peeped from her casement small;
2072,THE JOURNEY,"""Here's shelter and quiet to give you rest, young man,"
2073,THE JOURNEY,"And apples for thirst withal."""
2074,THE JOURNEY,
2075,THE JOURNEY,"And he looked up out of his sad reverie,"
2076,THE JOURNEY,"And saw all the woods in green,"
2077,THE JOURNEY,"With birds that flitted feathered in the dappling,"
2078,THE JOURNEY,The jewel-bright leaves between.
2079,THE JOURNEY,
2080,THE JOURNEY,"And he lifted up his face towards her lattice,"
2081,THE JOURNEY,"And there, alluring-wise,"
2082,THE JOURNEY,"Slanting through the silence of the long past,"
2083,THE JOURNEY,Dwelt the still green Witch's eyes.
2084,THE JOURNEY,
2085,THE JOURNEY,And vaguely from the hiding-place of memory
2086,THE JOURNEY,Voices seemed to cry;
2087,THE JOURNEY,"""What is the darkness of one brief life-time"
2088,THE JOURNEY,"To the deaths thou hast made us die?"""
2089,THE JOURNEY,
2090,THE JOURNEY,"""Heed not the words of the Enchantress"
2091,THE JOURNEY,"Who would us still betray!"""
2092,THE JOURNEY,"And sad with the echo of their reproaches,"
2093,THE JOURNEY,"Doubting, he turned away."
2094,THE JOURNEY,
2095,THE JOURNEY,"""I may not shelter 'neath your roof, lady,"
2096,THE JOURNEY,"Nor in this wood's green shadow seek repose,"
2097,THE JOURNEY,Nor will your apples quench the thirst
2098,THE JOURNEY,"A homesick wanderer knows."""
2099,THE JOURNEY,
2100,THE JOURNEY,"""'Homesick, forsooth!'"" she softly mocked him:"
2101,THE JOURNEY,And the beauty in her face
2102,THE JOURNEY,Made in the sunshine pale and trembling
2103,THE JOURNEY,A stillness in that place.
2104,THE JOURNEY,
2105,THE JOURNEY,"And he sighed, as if in fear, the young Wanderer,"
2106,THE JOURNEY,"Looking to left and to right,"
2107,THE JOURNEY,"Where the endless narrow road swept onward,"
2108,THE JOURNEY,In the distance lost to sight.
2109,THE JOURNEY,
2110,THE JOURNEY,"And there fell upon his sense the briar,"
2111,THE JOURNEY,"Haunting the air with its breath,"
2112,THE JOURNEY,"And the faint shrill sweetness of the birds' throats,"
2113,THE JOURNEY,Their tent of leaves beneath.
2114,THE JOURNEY,
2115,THE JOURNEY,"And there was the Witch, in no wise heeding;"
2116,THE JOURNEY,"Her arbour, and fruit-filled dish,"
2117,THE JOURNEY,"Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--"
2118,THE JOURNEY,All that the weary wish.
2119,THE JOURNEY,
2120,THE JOURNEY,And the last gold beam across the green world
2121,THE JOURNEY,"Faltered and failed, as he"
2122,THE JOURNEY,Remembered his solitude and the dark night's
2123,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.
2124,THE JOURNEY,
2125,THE JOURNEY,And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow
2126,THE JOURNEY,In the darkening of the day;
2127,THE JOURNEY,And turned him aside into oblivion;
2128,THE JOURNEY,And the voices died away....
2129,THE JOURNEY,
2130,THE JOURNEY,And the Witch stepped down from her casement:
2131,THE JOURNEY,In the hush of night he heard
2132,THE JOURNEY,The calling and wailing in dewy thicket
2133,THE JOURNEY,Of bird to hidden bird.
2134,THE JOURNEY,
2135,THE JOURNEY,"And gloom stole all her burning crimson,"
2136,THE JOURNEY,Remote and faint in space
2137,THE JOURNEY,As stars in gathering shadow of the evening
2138,THE JOURNEY,Seemed now her phantom face.
2139,THE JOURNEY,
2140,THE JOURNEY,"And one night's rest shall be a myriad,"
2141,THE JOURNEY,Midst dreams that come and go;
2142,THE JOURNEY,"Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him"
2143,THE JOURNEY,This same strange by-way through:
2144,THE JOURNEY,
2145,THE JOURNEY,"To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,"
2146,THE JOURNEY,"The lips of welcome, and the eyes"
2147,THE JOURNEY,More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper
2148,THE JOURNEY,Lone in the lightening skies:
2149,THE JOURNEY,
2150,THE JOURNEY,Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;
2151,THE JOURNEY,"But, worn with wisdom, he"
2152,THE JOURNEY,Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's
2153,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.

2175,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,"
2176,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.

2178,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,[Illustration]

2185,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Her scarlet, buckled shoes they clicked, her heels a-twinkling high;"

2198,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before

2203,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"""A witch, and witches, one and nine,"" they straight to her reply,"

2205,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,
2206,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,"Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees up-grow,"
2207,AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING,And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
