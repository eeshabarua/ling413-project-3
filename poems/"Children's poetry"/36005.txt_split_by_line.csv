208,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"But her name was Ina Bradford. She had no brothers, so she used to tell"

218,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"liked. But Black Jupiter she must never touch. He was a large,"
219,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"high-spirited horse, very unsafe for a young girl. But oh! how Ina"
220,A RECKLESS RIDE.,longed to get on Jupiter's back.
221,A RECKLESS RIDE.,
222,A RECKLESS RIDE.,One day when her father had gone away Ina resolved to try. She put
223,A RECKLESS RIDE.,bridle and saddle on without trouble. But the moment Black Jupiter felt
224,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"her weight on his back, he started on a run up the street. At first Ina"
225,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"thought it great fun, but by and by her arms ached so she could scarcely"
226,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"hold the bridle. And when Jupiter jumped at the cackling of a goose, Ina"
227,A RECKLESS RIDE.,"would have fallen if a strong, brave boy had not caught the bridle. Ina"
228,A RECKLESS RIDE.,did not care to ride Black Jupiter again.
