45,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
46,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,|Once I had a little black and white kitten. She was very cunning and
47,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"playful, but not very wise."
48,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
49,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,On one side of our house was a high grape trellis. One morning kitty
50,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,went out and began to climb this trellis. She put one little paw before
51,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"the other, and went bravely up, up, up, till she reached the top. Then"
52,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,she looked down to the ground and mewed piteously. I suppose when she
53,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"looked down and saw very far off the ground was, she was frightened and"
54,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,dizzy.
55,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
56,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"When I heard her cry, I ran out to see what was the matter. Their stood"
57,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"kitty on the very top of the trellis, clinging to the slats with her"
58,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"little paws. The fur stood up all over her back and tail, she was so"
59,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"frightened. ""Mew I mew!"" she cried."
60,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
61,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,I saw how badly she felt and how afraid she was of falling.
62,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
63,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,[Illustration: 9011]
64,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
65,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,I tried to think of some way to help her. I got a basket and tied the
66,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,handle to a long pole. Then I took hold of the pole and held the basket
67,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"up as high as I could reach. Then I called, ""Kitty, Kitty,"" and with a"
68,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"spring, down she came into the basket."
69,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
70,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,I took her down and into the house. She seemed so glad to be safely
71,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,on the ground once more that I thought she would never do that foolish
72,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,thing again.
73,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,
74,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,But every morning this stupid little kitten would climb the trellis just
75,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"the same, and have to be taken down in the basket. I suppose she thought"
76,KITTY'S BASKET RIDE.,"it fun to climb up, and rather enjoyed the ride down in the basket."

98,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
99,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"|Where we live, it snowed from morning till night on the day before"
100,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"Thanksgiving. Papa and John, our hired man, got the double sleigh down"
101,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"from the loft, where it had been resting all summer. I don't think it"
102,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"was tired, but it rested all the same."
103,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
104,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"Old Kate and Charley were harnessed, and they were as frisky as young"
105,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"lambs. They seemed to know it was Thanksgiving, and were as happy as the"
106,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"children. We were all wrapped up in thick, warm clothes, and packed in"
107,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"the sleigh. Large as it was, we filled it quite full."
108,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
109,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,We all went to church first. Do you know what Thanksgiving means? The
110,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,good people who first came to make their homes in New England set apart
111,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"a day and called it by this name. In the autumn, after the corn had been"
112,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"gathered, the apples picked, and the vegetables put in the cellar, they"
113,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,felt very thankful to God for all these good things. They fixed a time
114,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,to meet in the churches to give thanks to God. They gave thanks in
115,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"prayers, in hymns, and in sermons. They had a good dinner on that day,"
116,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,and were as happy as they could be. The children and the children's
117,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,children went home to spend the day. It was the home festival.
118,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
119,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"People do not go to church so much as they did, but it is still the"
120,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,home festival. We went to church; and after that we all had a long
121,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"sleigh-ride to Grandpa's. Uncle George and Aunt Lucy were there, and"
122,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,cousins were almost as plenty as the snowflakes the day before.
123,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
124,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"We played ""blind-man's buff"" before dinner. We laughed and screamed, and"
125,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"rolled and tumbled on the floor. Grandpa and Grandma sat laughing at us,"
126,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,as happy as we were.
127,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
128,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,The great event of the day was the dinner. Grandpa sat at the head of
129,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,the table in his arm-chair. Some of the children thought he never would
130,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"get his knife sharp enough to carve the turkey. Flora, the maid, brought"
131,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,it in. All the little ones screamed when she put it on the table. It was
132,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"a very large turkey, and was nicely browned. We never saw anything that"
133,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,looked so good.
134,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
135,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,The turkey tasted as good as it looked. For ten minutes the children did
136,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,not scream or laugh out loud. I suppose their mouths were too full. Then
137,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,we had to eat plum pudding and four kinds of pies. We did not feel so
138,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,much like it as we did. I am afraid we ate all we could rather than all
139,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,we needed.
140,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
141,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,After dinner Grandma told us about her little ones. We all wanted to
142,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"know where they were now. Grandma laughed, and pointed to Uncle George,"
143,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"Papa, and Aunt Lucy. We could hardly believe they were ever little"
144,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,things like us. Then Grandpa told us how he killed a great bear near the
145,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,old house ever so many years before.
146,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
147,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"Uncle George showed us how to play ""London Bridge."" Some of us were"
148,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"parts of the bridge, and some of us went under it. After that we played"
149,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"""snap-apple."" Aunt Lucy tied an apple by a string to the ceiling, and we"
150,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"bit at it Every time we bit, the apple flew away from us. It was great"
151,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,fun.
152,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
153,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"After supper the ""day was over"" with the little ones. We could not keep"
154,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"our eyes open, and some of us slept all the way home in that double"
155,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"sleigh. I know I dreamed about that long table at dinner, and thought we"
156,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"were playing ""snap-apple"" with the big roast turkey."
157,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,
158,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"That Thanksgiving was many, many years ago, and some of those mites of"
159,THANKSGIVING AT GRANDPA'S.,"little ones that played ""London Bridge"" are grandpas and grandmas now."

168,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"|One evening last summer a tramp, who had travelled many miles, lay down"
169,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,on the leaves in a pleasant wood. Before he went to sleep he pulled off
170,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"one shoe, for it had chafed his foot till it was very sore."

172,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,[Illustration: 0014]
173,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
174,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"In the morning he rose, and prepared to go on to beg his morning meal."
175,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"When he tried to put his shoe on, it hurt his foot so badly that he"
176,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"groaned aloud. He gave up trying to wear it, and threw it into the"
177,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,bushes.
178,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
179,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"The shoe caught in the fork of a young maple-tree, and hung fast by the"
180,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"heel, with the toe downward. The tramp limped away on his journey, and"
181,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,went I don't know where.
182,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
183,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,Before many days a bright-eyed little bird spied the shoe. She thought
184,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,it would be a fine place to build a home in. So she and her mate brought
185,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,fine twigs and straw and leaves in their bills. They placed them in the
186,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"shoe in pretty nest-shape, and lined their new house with soft hair and"
187,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,wool.
188,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
189,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,Beth and her papa were out searching for wood-flowers one day. The
190,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,shadow of the shoe fell on the moss beneath the little maple.
191,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
192,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"Looking up, Beth saw the nest. Her papa bent the maple down, and Beth"
193,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,looked in. She saw five cunning little blue eggs lying cosily against
194,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,the gray lining.
195,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
196,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"Beth is a tiny girl, just past being rocked to sleep in mamma's lap. She"
197,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"laughed aloud, and clapped her fat little hands for joy, when she saw"
198,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,this dainty sight.
199,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,
200,A QUEER PLACE FOR A BIRD'S HOME.,"I think there were some little birdies in that shoe before long, don't"

228,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"|One morning last week I was walking along the street, and I saw a"
229,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"kitten on the pavement. It was white, with black spots on its head and"
230,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"neck. It sat as close to the fence as it could get, and looked very"
231,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"lonesome, as if it did not belong to anybody."
232,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
233,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,[Illustration: 9016]
234,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
235,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,Every time a person went by the kitten would lift up its head and mew.
236,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,I knew quite well that it was hungry and did not know where to get any
237,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,breakfast. I wished that I had something with me to give it to eat. Just
238,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,then a boy came along with a milk-can in his hand. He looked like a
239,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,good boy. He had pleasant blue eyes and rosy cheeks. He was whistling a
240,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"lively tune, as if he was very merry and happy. When Kitty saw him, she"
241,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,lifted up her head and gave a loud mew. The boy stopped and noticed her.
242,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
243,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"""Kitty!"" said he; ""I believe you are hungry, and are asking me to feed"
244,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"you. I wish I had a dish, and I would give you some milk."""
245,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
246,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,He looked all around. By and by he saw a little hollow place in one
247,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"of the stones of the pavement. Then he said, ""Come here, Kitty; I have"
248,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"found a basin for you."""
249,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
250,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"He poured some milk out of his can into the hollow, and Kitty ran and"
251,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,lapped it up as fast as she could.
252,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
253,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"Then he poured in some more, till Kitty had eaten all she wanted. When"
254,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"he had done this, he said, ""Good-morning, Kitty,"" and he went on his way"
255,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,whistling.
256,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
257,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"Was n't he a good boy? I watched him till he was out of sight, because"
258,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,I was so glad that I had seen him. It is so pleasant to meet people that
259,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"are kind and thoughtful, whether they are old or young."
260,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
261,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,"I was very glad for Kitty, too. When I left her she was washing her"
262,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,face and stretching herself in the warm sunshine. She seemed to feel
263,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,so comfortable now that she had eaten a nice breakfast. It was a real
264,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,pleasure to look at her.
265,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,
266,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,I hope Kitty will find such a good friend as this little milkman every
267,THE GOOD LITTLE MILKMAN.,day.

354,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
355,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,|One afternoon little Robbie Fales came home with a very sober face.
356,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"Charley Allen, one of the school-boys, had just had a present of a"
357,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"handsome drum. Robbie wanted one, too. He wanted one so much that he"
358,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,could not think of any thing else all the evening. At last Grandma began
359,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,to wonder if he was sick; so he had to tell her what he was thinking
360,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,about.
361,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
362,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"""I wish father could buy one for me; but I know he can't afford it,"""
363,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"said Robbie, with a long sigh."
364,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
365,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"""Perhaps I can fix up one for you,"" said Grandma."
366,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
367,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"""Oh, I should be so glad if you could!"" said Robbie. ""I know you can fix"
368,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"lots of things; but I don't believe you could make a drum."""
369,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
370,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"""Well, I can try,"" said Grandma; ""and I think I can fix something for"
371,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"you that will make a noise, if it should n't be like a real drum."""
372,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,
373,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"So the next day, when Robbie was away at school, Grandma Fales went to"
374,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,work to make a drum for him in a way she had thought of. She found a
375,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,"wooden box that was light but strong, and about the right size."

381,ROBBIE'S DRUM.,For the drum-sticks she found some spokes that had been broken out of an

462,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
463,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,|Karl and Christina were little German children. It was summer when they
464,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,came to live in the house by the bridge. As soon as they were settled
465,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,in their new home they began to go to school. The road that led to the
466,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,school went by Farmer Grün's orchard. The trees in the orchard were full
467,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,of apples. Karl and Christina would look at them when they were going
468,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"past, and they longed to have some of them to eat."
469,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
470,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"""You must never go into the orchard,"" their mother said; ""but if any of"
471,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"the apples should fall into the road, it would not be wrong for you to"
472,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"pick them up."""
473,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
474,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,There was one tree that stood nearer the roadside wall than the others
475,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"did, and it had bright red pippins on it. The children called this their"
476,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"tree, and every time they went by it they would say, ""Pretty pippins,"
477,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"please to fall into the road."""
478,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
479,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"Several weeks passed, and the pippins grew larger and redder; but they"
480,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,did not fall into the road. Some of them dropped off; but they
481,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"fell into the orchard. By and by the harvest-time came, and"
482,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,Karl Sind Christina began to think their tree would never give them
483,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,anything.
484,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
485,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,[Illustration: 0024]
486,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
487,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,One day Farmer Grün was in the orchard as they were going by. He heard
488,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"them say, ""Pretty pippins, please to fall into the road."" So when they"
489,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,were looking the other way he threw a number of the pippins over the
490,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"wall. The children were delighted to see them, and ran to pick them up."
491,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"Then they said, ""Thank you, good tree."""
492,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
493,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"Farmer Grün laughed to hear them, and wondered who these queer little"
494,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"folks were. He inquired about them, and found that they belonged to a"
495,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,poor but honest family that had lately moved into the town. After this
496,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,he was often in the orchard gathering the apples for market. When he saw
497,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"the little brother and sister coming, he would always toss some of the"
498,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,pippins over the wall where they could get them.
499,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,
500,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"At last he spoke to them, and told them they might come into the orchard"
501,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"on Saturdays, and pick up as many apples as they could carry home. So"
502,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,"Karl and Christina went many times, and worked as busily as two bees"
503,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,till they got a barrel of apples for winter. Farmer Grün liked the
504,THE PIPPIN-TREE.,children because they were so honest and so willing to work.

524,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,It was very quiet and warm. Grandpa West sat there writing. There was a
525,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,"little pile of chips and bits of paper on the hearth, ready to light the"

527,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,
528,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,Mousie smelt crumbs of cake in one of the papers. He crept in and found
529,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,"them. They were very nice, but he wanted something more to eat. He"
530,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,nibbled some of the chips. There was a match among them.
531,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,
532,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,Mousie found the match. He did not know what it was. Mousie never
533,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,"smoked, and never lighted fires. So he thought matches were of no use;"

547,MOUSIE'S MATCH.,"Then he sat down in his easy-chair, and laughed to think how fast mousie"

1316,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,
1317,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,One day they made a hole under the fence. Piggy White got out of the

1322,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,

1330,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Let us go up the hill,"" said a spotted one. The other little pigs said"
1331,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Wee! wee!"" again. That is the way they said yes."
1332,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,
1333,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,So they started up the hill. It was a very small hill; but the pigs
1334,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"said, ""What a large hill this is!"" They were only baby pigs, you know."
1335,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"This was their first walk, out of their yard. By and by they came to"

1338,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"there?"" said the brown pig. ""Wee! wee!"" said the others. You see, a pig"
1339,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,thinks the whole world was made for pigs. Some one had left the gate
1340,NINE LITTLE PIGS.,"open. The nine pigs went into the yard, one after another. No one was in"

1619,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,Uncle Will walked up to find out what was the matter. What did he see

1623,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,
1624,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,The boys thought this was great fun. They never had seen so strange a

1626,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,"him, and tucked his head under his arm. He was glad enough to be taken"
1627,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,home.
1628,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,
1629,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,"Zip was very fond of music. When the piano was played, he would stalk"

1631,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,tap on the window till he was let in. Then he would dance up to the
1632,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,"piano, and strike upon the keys with his beak. If the tune was a lively"
1633,ZIP IN TROUBLE.,"one, he seemed to enjoy it all 'the more; he would tap faster and"

1819,THE PET FOX.,
1820,THE PET FOX.,His young master fastened him by this chain; and then he gave him

1837,THE PET FOX.,Down the road there lived a blacksmith who had two pet raccoons. They

2901,ABOUT A QUEER MAN.,
2902,ABOUT A QUEER MAN.,People stared at him and laughed at him. This was just what pleased

2966,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,helped her brother scatter com to the hens and turkeys. She liked to

2972,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,[Illustration: 9111]
2973,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
2974,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,Below the orchard there was a field where the cows were feeding. One of

2978,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
2979,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,So she filled her apron with sweet apples and went up to the fence.
2980,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,Brindle took the apples from her hand and seemed to think they were
2981,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"very good. The fence was low and broken where she was standing, and she"
2982,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,pushed against it hard because she was so glad to get the apples. She
2983,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"wanted more and more, and pushed against the fence till it was almost"
2984,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,thrown down.
2985,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
2986,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"When Betty saw the fence falling she felt frightened a little, and"
2987,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"stepped away. Brindle had not got apples enough, so she jumped right"

2991,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,[Illustration: 0112]
2992,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
2993,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,When Brindle saw her going off she began to run after her. She did not
2994,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"wish to hurt or frighten Betty, she only wanted to get what she carried"
2995,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,in her apron.
2996,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
2997,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"Betty was very much afraid, so she ran faster and faster. By and by"
2998,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,she let go of her apron and the apples rolled down to the ground. Then
2999,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"Brindle stopped and went to eating them. She was quite satisfied now,"
3000,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,and did not go any farther.
3001,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,
3002,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,So Betty got away and was not harmed at all. She found her father and
3003,BETTY AND BRINDLE.,"told him about it, and he drove Brindle back to her pasture. Then he put"

3540,AN ODD BABY.,"John was so glad to hear that they were to go in a boat, ""up the great"

3543,AN ODD BABY.,"Sue added, ""O, I do hope we shall see some Indians, out West!"" When"
3544,AN ODD BABY.,"they came to the river, they found that the boats could not run. It was"
3545,AN ODD BABY.,"spring, but the ice was not yet gone; so they had to go up the river in"

3547,AN ODD BABY.,
3548,AN ODD BABY.,"John did not like this; no one liked it, for it did not seem safe. All"

3553,AN ODD BABY.,
3554,AN ODD BABY.,"This made the rest laugh, for no one thought Sue would have her wish."
3555,AN ODD BABY.,"But, as they rode up the street of the town, some one cried out:"

3591,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,
3592,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"|Tessa was a little Italian girl. She lived with her grandfather, who"
3593,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,was an organ-player. They did not have any home. They wandered about
3594,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"from town to town, and Tessa danced while her grandfather played on the"
3595,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,organ. In this way they earned all the money they had.
3596,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,
3597,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,One afternoon they started to go to a place where they had never been
3598,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"before. They did not know the way, and they walked till it was almost"
3599,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,dark. They were in the country among the corn-fields and green orchards.
3600,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"Tessa was so tired she could not go any farther; so they stopped, and"
3601,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,ate their supper of dry bread and drank some water from a running brook.
3602,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"Then they went into a meadow where there were some heaps of hay, and lay"
3603,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"down for the night. Tessa had often stayed out of doors all night, so"
3604,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,she was not afraid; and she and her grandfather were soon asleep on the
3605,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,sweet-smelling hay.
3606,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,
3607,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,The next morning they woke up rested; but they were very hungry. They
3608,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"saw a house near by, and went to it to get something to eat. The house"
3609,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"belonged to Mr. Lane. He invited the travellers in, and Mrs. Lane gave"
3610,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"them a good breakfast. After they had eaten, the grandfather played on"
3611,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"the organ, and Tessa danced."
3612,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,
3613,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,Martha and Nannie Lane were little girls about the age of Tessa. They
3614,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,were much pleased with these strange visitors. They had never heard a
3615,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"hand-organ before, and they had never seen any one dance like Tessa."
3616,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"They wanted her to stay all day with them, and she was very glad to do"
3617,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"so. She had always lived in cities, and it seemed delightful to her to"
3618,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,be in the country. So while her grandfather rested and slept under a
3619,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"shady tree, she ran about and played with Martha and Nannie. They danced"
3620,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"together in the big barn, and they went into the fields and gathered"
3621,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,berries and flowers.
3622,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,
3623,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,"That night Mr. Lane was going to the next town, and he took Tessa and"
3624,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,her grandfather along with him in his wagon. Martha and Nannie were very
3625,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,sorry to have them go. They gave Tessa some clothes and a bag of cakes
3626,TESSA'S HAPPY DAY.,and apples.

4271,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,One day as he was following his master's team he went by a house where a
4272,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,white cat lay on the porch. Spot made a dash for her. She left the porch
4273,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,and ran like a white streak straight up a large tree in the yard.
4274,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,
4275,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,"Spot was right at her heels. And because she went up the tree, he"

4283,THE DOG THAT RAN UP A TREE.,"When he picked himself up, he took no further interest in that cat, but"
