26,FOREWORD,
27,FOREWORD,Practically every state course of study gives a list of poems from which
28,FOREWORD,it is required that selection be made for reading or memorizing. These
29,FOREWORD,"lists and their grading vary in the different states, although the same"
30,FOREWORD,poems are used in many of them and there are some which are required
31,FOREWORD,in every state.
32,FOREWORD,
33,FOREWORD,In the preparation of this book the lists of the third and fourth grade
34,FOREWORD,poems prescribed by the syllabi of twelve states have been examined and
35,FOREWORD,the contents have been made up from these. The breadth of this method of
36,FOREWORD,selection insures the inclusion in this volume of a large proportion of
37,FOREWORD,the required poems for every state. Since the grading in different states
38,FOREWORD,"varies so widely, teachers will find included, also, many poems which in"
39,FOREWORD,their own particular states are required in other grades. It is hoped
40,FOREWORD,that this volume will be of real service to teachers in providing a
41,FOREWORD,"collection of ""required poems"" in a form convenient for school use."

811,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo;"
812,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,In his fur the breeze of morning
813,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Played as in the prairie grasses.
814,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
815,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,On the white sand of the bottom
816,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma,"
817,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes;"
818,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Through his gills he breathed the water,"
819,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With his fins he fanned and winnowed,"
820,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With his tail he swept the sand-floor.
821,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
822,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,There he lay in all his armor;
823,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"On each side a shield to guard him,"
824,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Plates of bone upon his forehead,"
825,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Down his sides and back and shoulders
826,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Plates of bone with spines projecting!
827,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Painted was he with his war-paints,"
828,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Stripes of yellow, red, and azure,"
829,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Spots of brown and spots of sable;
830,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he lay there on the bottom,"
831,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Fanning with his fins of purple,"
832,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,As above him Hiawatha
833,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In his birch canoe came sailing,"
834,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With his fishing-line of cedar.
835,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
836,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait!"" cried Hiawatha,"
837,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Down into the depths beneath him,"
838,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait, O sturgeon, Nahma!"
839,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Come up from below the water,"
840,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Let us see which is the stronger!"""
841,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And he dropped his line of cedar
842,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Through the clear, transparent water,"
843,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Waited vainly for an answer,"
844,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Long sat waiting for an answer,"
845,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And repeating loud and louder,"
846,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"""
847,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
848,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma,"
849,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Fanning slowly in the water,"
850,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Looking up at Hiawatha,"
851,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Listening to his call and clamor,"
852,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"His unnecessary tumult,"
853,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till he wearied of the shouting;
854,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he said to the Kenozha,"
855,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To the pike, the Maskenozha,"
856,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take the bait of this rude fellow,"
857,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Break the line of Hiawatha!"""
858,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
859,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,In his fingers Hiawatha
860,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Felt the loose line jerk and tighten;
861,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As he drew it in, it tugged so"
862,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"That the birch canoe stood endwise,"
863,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Like a birch log in the water,"
864,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
865,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Perched and frisking on the summit.
866,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
867,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Full of scorn was Hiawatha
868,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"When he saw the fish rise upward,"
869,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,"
870,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Coming nearer, nearer to him,"
871,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he shouted through the water,"
872,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Esa! esa! shame upon you!"
873,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are but the pike, Kenozha,"
874,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the fish I wanted,"
875,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the King of Fishes!"""
876,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
877,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Reeling downward to the bottom
878,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sank the pike in great confusion,"
879,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma,"
880,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
881,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To the bream, with scales of crimson,"
882,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take the bait of this great boaster,"
883,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Break the line of Hiawatha!"""
884,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
885,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming,"
886,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
887,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Seized the line of Hiawatha,"
888,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Swung with all his weight upon it,"
889,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Made a whirlpool in the water,"
890,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Whirled the birch canoe in circles,"
891,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Round and round in gurgling eddies,"
892,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the circles in the water
893,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Reached the far-off sandy beaches,"
894,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the water-flags and rushes
895,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Nodded on the distant margins.
896,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
897,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,But when Hiawatha saw him
898,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly rising through the water,"
899,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lifting up his disk refulgent,"
900,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Loud he shouted in derision,"
901,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Esa! esa! shame upon you!"
902,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
903,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the fish I wanted,"
904,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the King of Fishes!"""
905,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
906,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming,"
907,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
908,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And again the sturgeon, Nahma,"
909,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard the shout of Hiawatha,"
910,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard his challenge of defiance,"
911,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"The unnecessary tumult,"
912,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Ringing far across the water.
913,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
914,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,From the white sand of the bottom
915,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Up he rose with angry gesture,"
916,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Quivering in each nerve and fibre,"
917,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Clashing all his plates of armor,"
918,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;
919,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In his wrath he darted upward,"
920,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Flashing leaped into the sunshine,"
921,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Opened his great jaws, and swallowed"
922,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Both canoe and Hiawatha.
923,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
924,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Down into that darksome cavern
925,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,"
926,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As a log on some black river,"
927,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shoots and plunges down the rapids,"
928,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Found himself in utter darkness,"
929,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Groped about in helpless wonder,"
930,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till he felt a great heart beating,"
931,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Throbbing in that utter darkness.
932,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
933,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he smote it in his anger,"
934,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With his fist, the heart of Nahma,"
935,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Felt the mighty King of Fishes
936,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shudder through each nerve and fibre,"
937,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Heard the water gurgle round him
938,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As he leaped and staggered through it,"
939,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sick at heart, and faint and weary."
940,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
941,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Crosswise then did Hiawatha
942,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Drag his birch-canoe for safety,"
943,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,"
944,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the turmoil and confusion,"
945,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Forth he might be hurled and perish.
946,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
947,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Frisked and chattered very gayly,"
948,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha
949,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the labor was completed.
950,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
951,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then said Hiawatha to him,"
952,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""O my little friend, the squirrel,"
953,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Bravely have you toiled to help me;
954,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Take the thanks of Hiawatha,"
955,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And the name which now he gives you;
956,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,For hereafter and forever
957,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,"
958,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"""
959,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
960,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And again the sturgeon, Nahma,"
961,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Gasped and quivered in the water,"
962,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then was still, and drifted landward"
963,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till he grated on the pebbles,"
964,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the listening Hiawatha
965,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard him grate upon the margin,"
966,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Felt him strand upon the pebbles,"
967,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,"
968,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Lay there dead upon the margin.
969,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
970,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then he heard a clang and flapping,"
971,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As of many wings assembling,"
972,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard a screaming and confusion,"
973,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As of birds of prey contending,"
974,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw a gleam of light above him,"
975,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shining through the ribs of Nahma,"
976,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,"
977,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,"
978,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Gazing at him through the opening,"
979,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard them saying to each other,"
980,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""'Tis our brother, Hiawatha!"""
981,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
982,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he shouted from below them,"
983,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Cried exulting from the caverns:
984,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!"
985,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;"
986,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Make the rifts a little larger,"
987,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With your claws the openings widen,"
988,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Set me free from this dark prison,"
989,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And henceforward and forever
990,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Men shall speak of your achievements,"
991,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,"
992,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"""
993,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
994,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls
995,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Toiled with beak and claws together,"
996,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Made the rifts and openings wider
997,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the mighty ribs of Nahma,"
998,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And from peril and from prison,"
999,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From the body of the sturgeon,"
1000,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From the peril of the water,"
1001,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,They released my Hiawatha.
1002,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
1003,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"He was standing near his wigwam,"
1004,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"On the margin of the water,"
1005,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he called to old Nokomis,"
1006,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Called and beckoned to Nokomis,"
1007,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,"
1008,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lying lifeless on the pebbles,"
1009,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With the sea-gulls feeding on him.
1010,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
1011,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,"
1012,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slain the King of Fishes!"" said he;"
1013,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,"
1014,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls;"
1015,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Drive them not away, Nokomis,"
1016,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,They have saved me from great peril
1017,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the body of the sturgeon,"
1018,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Wait until their meal is ended,"
1019,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till their craws are full with feasting,"
1020,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till they homeward fly, at sunset,"
1021,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,To their nests among the marshes;
1022,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then bring all your pots and kettles,"
1023,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And make oil for us in Winter."""
1024,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
1025,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And she waited till the sun set,"
1026,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun,"
1027,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Rose above the tranquil water,"
1028,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls,"
1029,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From their banquet rose with clamor,"
1030,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And across the fiery sunset
1031,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Winged their way to far-off islands,"
1032,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,To their nests among the rushes.
1033,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
1034,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To his sleep went Hiawatha,"
1035,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And Nokomis to her labor,"
1036,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Toiling patient in the moonlight,"
1037,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sun and moon changed places,"
1038,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sky was red with sunrise,"
1039,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls,"
1040,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Came back from the reedy islands,"
1041,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Clamorous for their morning banquet.
1042,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,
1043,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Three whole days and nights alternate
1044,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Old Nokomis and the seagulls
1045,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma,"
1046,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the waves washed through the rib-bones,"
1047,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sea-gulls came no longer,"
1048,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And upon the sands lay nothing
1049,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,But the skeleton of Nahma.

1168,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Took the nets, that hung together,"
1169,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Dripping, freezing at the doorway,"
1170,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Like a wisp of straw he wrung them,"
1171,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Like a wisp of straw he broke them,"
1172,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Could not wring them without breaking,"
1173,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Such the strength was in his fingers.
1174,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,
1175,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"""Lazy Kwasind!"" said his father,"
1176,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"""In the hunt you never help me;"
1177,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Every bow you touch is broken,"

1180,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"You shall bring the hunting homeward."""
1181,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,
1182,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Down a narrow pass they wandered,"
1183,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Where a brooklet led them onward,"
1184,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Where the trail of deer and bison
1185,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Marked the soft mud on the margin,"
1186,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Till they found all further passage
1187,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Shut against them, barred securely"
1188,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"By the trunks of trees uprooted,"
1189,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise,"
1190,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,And forbidding further passage.

1192,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"""We must go back,"" said the old man,"

1196,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"And straightway his pipe he lighted,"
1197,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,And sat down to smoke and ponder.
1198,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"But before his pipe was finished,"
1199,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Lo! the path was cleared before him;
1200,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"All the trunks had Kwasind lifted,"
1201,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"To the right hand, to the left hand,"
1202,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows,"
1203,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Hurled the cedars light as lances.

1205,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"""Lazy Kwasind!"" said the young men,"
1206,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,As they sported in the meadow:

1213,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"To their challenge made no answer,"
1214,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Only rose, and, slowly turning,"
1215,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Seized the huge rock in his fingers,"
1216,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Tore it from its deep foundation,"
1217,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Poised it in the air a moment,"
1218,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Pitched it sheer into the river,"
1219,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Sheer into the swift Pauwating,"
1220,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Where it still is seen in Summer.
1221,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,
1222,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Once as down that foaming river,"
1223,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Down the rapids of Pauwating,"
1224,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Kwasind sailed with his companions,"
1225,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"In the stream he saw a beaver,"
1226,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Saw Ahmeek, the King of Beavers,"
1227,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Struggling with the rushing currents,"

1239,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"But he reappeared triumphant,"
1240,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,And upon his shining shoulders
1241,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Brought the beaver, dead and dripping,"
1242,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Brought the King of all the Beavers.
1243,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,
1244,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"And these two, as I have told you,"
1245,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Were the friends of Hiawatha,"
1246,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Chibiabos, the musician,"
1247,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"And the very strong man, Kwasind."
1248,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Long they lived in peace together,"
1249,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,"Spake with naked hearts together,"
1250,HIAWATHA'S FRIENDS,Pondering much and much contriving

1255,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1256,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Forth into the forest straightway
1257,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,All alone walked Hiawatha
1258,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Proudly, with his bow and arrows,"
1259,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"And the birds sang round him, o'er him,"
1260,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"""Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"""
1261,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Sang the robin, the Opechee,"
1262,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Sang the blue bird, the Owaissa,"
1263,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"""Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!"""
1264,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1265,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Up the oak tree, close beside him,"

1267,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"In and out among the branches,"
1268,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Coughed and chattered from the oak tree,"
1269,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Laughed, and said between his laughing,"
1270,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"""Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"""
1271,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1272,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,And the rabbit from his pathway
1273,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Leaped aside, and at a distance"
1274,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Sat erect upon his haunches,"
1275,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Half in fear and half in frolic,"
1276,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Saying to the little hunter,"
1277,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"""Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!"""
1278,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1279,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"But he heeded not, nor heard them,"
1280,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,For his thoughts were with the red deer;
1281,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"On their tracks his eyes were fastened,"
1282,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Leading downward to the river,"
1283,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"To the ford across the river,"
1284,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"And as one in slumber walked he,"
1285,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1286,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Hidden in the alder bushes.
1287,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"There he waited till the deer came,"
1288,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Till he saw two antlers lifted,"
1289,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Saw two eyes look from the thicket,"
1290,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Saw two nostrils point to windward,"
1291,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"And a deer came down the pathway,"
1292,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Flecked with leafy light and shadow.
1293,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"And his heart within him fluttered,"
1294,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Trembled like the leaves above him,"
1295,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Like the birch-leaf palpitated,"
1296,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,As the deer came down the pathway.
1297,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1298,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Then, upon one knee uprising,"
1299,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Hiawatha aimed an arrow;
1300,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Scarce a twig moved with his motion,"
1301,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,"
1302,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"But the wary roebuck started,"
1303,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Stamped with all his hoofs together,"
1304,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Listened with one foot uplifted,"
1305,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Leaped as if to meet the arrow;
1306,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,"
1307,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!
1308,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1309,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Dead he lay there in the forest,"
1310,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,By the ford across the river;
1311,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Beat his timid heart no longer,"
1312,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,But the heart of Hiawatha
1313,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Throbbed and shouted and exulted,"
1314,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"As he bore the red deer homeward,"
1315,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,And Iagoo and Nokomis
1316,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Hailed his coming with applauses.
1317,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,
1318,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,From the red deer's hide Nokomis
1319,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Made a cloak for Hiawatha,"
1320,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,From the red deer's flesh Nokomis
1321,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,Made a banquet in his honor.
1322,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"All the village came and feasted,"
1323,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"All the guests praised Hiawatha,"
1324,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Called him Strong-heart, Soan-ge-taha!"
1325,HIAWATHA'S HUNTING,"Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!"

1328,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,HIAWATHA'S SAILING
1329,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1330,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Give me of your bark, O Birch-Tree!"

1332,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Growing by the rushing river,"
1333,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Tall and stately in the valley!
1334,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"I a light canoe will build me,"
1335,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing,"
1336,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"That shall float upon the river,"
1337,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,"
1338,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Like a yellow water-lily!
1339,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1340,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-Tree!"
1341,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Lay aside your white-skin wrapper,"
1342,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"For the Summer-time is coming,"
1343,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And the sun is warm in heaven,"
1344,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And you need no white-skin wrapper!"""
1345,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1346,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Thus aloud cried Hiawatha
1347,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"In the solitary forest,"
1348,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"By the rushing Taquamenaw,"
1349,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"When the birds were singing gayly,"
1350,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"In the Moon of Leaves were singing,"
1351,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And the sun, from sleep awaking,"
1352,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Started up and said, ""Behold me!"
1353,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me!"""
1354,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1355,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,And the tree with all its branches
1356,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Rustled in the breeze of morning,"
1357,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Saying, with a sigh of patience,"
1358,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"""
1359,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1360,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,With his knife the tree he girdled;
1361,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Just beneath its lowest branches,"
1362,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Just above the roots, he cut it,"
1363,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Till the sap came oozing outward:
1364,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Down the trunk, from top to bottom,"
1365,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,"
1366,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"With a wooden wedge he raised it,"
1367,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.
1368,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1369,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Give me of your boughs, O Cedar!"
1370,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Of your strong and pliant branches,"

1373,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1374,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Through the summit of the Cedar
1375,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Went a sound, a cry of horror,"
1376,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Went a murmur of resistance;
1377,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"But it whispered, bending downward,"
1378,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Take my boughs, O Hiawatha!"""
1379,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1380,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Down he hewed the boughs of cedar,"
1381,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Shaped them straightway to a framework,"
1382,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Like two bows he formed and shaped them,"
1383,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Like two bended bows together.
1384,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1385,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Give me of your roots, O Tamarack!"
1386,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-Tree!"
1387,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,My canoe to bind together.
1388,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"So to bind the ends together,"

1394,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Touched his forehead with its tassels,"
1395,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,"
1396,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Take them all, O Hiawatha!"""
1397,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1398,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"From the earth he tore the fibres,"
1399,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Tore the tough roots of the Larch-Tree,"
1400,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Closely sewed the bark together,"
1401,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Bound it closely to the framework.

1403,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Give me of your balm, O Fir-Tree!"
1404,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Of your balsam and your resin,"
1405,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,So to close the seams together

1407,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"That the river may not wet me!"""
1408,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1409,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And the Fir-Tree, tall and sombre,"

1411,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Rattled like a shore with pebbles,"
1412,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Answered wailing, answered weeping,"
1413,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Take my balm, O Hiawatha!"""
1414,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1415,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And he took the tears of balsam,"
1416,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Took the resin of the Fir-Tree,"
1417,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Smeared therewith each seam and fissure,"
1418,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Made each crevice safe from water.
1419,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1420,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog!"
1421,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog!"
1422,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"I will make a necklace of them,"
1423,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Make a girdle for my beauty,"
1424,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And two stars to deck her bosom!"""
1425,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1426,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,From a hollow tree the Hedgehog
1427,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"With his sleepy eyes looked at him,"
1428,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Shot his shining quills, like arrows,"
1429,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Saying, with a drowsy murmur,"
1430,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Through the tangle of his whiskers,"
1431,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"""Take my quills, O Hiawatha!"""
1432,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1433,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"From the ground the quills he gathered,"
1434,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"All the little shining arrows,"
1435,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Stained them red and blue and yellow,"
1436,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,With the juice of roots and berries;
1437,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Into his canoe he wrought them,"
1438,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Round its waist a shining girdle,"
1439,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Round its bow a gleaming necklace,"
1440,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,On its breast two stars resplendent.
1441,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1442,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Thus the Birch Canoe was builded
1443,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"In the valley, by the river,"
1444,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,In the bosom of the forest;
1445,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"And the forest's life was in it,"
1446,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"All its mystery and its magic,"
1447,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"All the lightness of the birch-tree,"
1448,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"All the toughness of the cedar,"
1449,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,All the larch's supple sinews;
1450,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,And it floated on the river
1451,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Like a yellow leaf in Autumn,"
1452,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Like a yellow water-lily.
1453,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1454,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Paddles none had Hiawatha,"
1455,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Paddles none he had or needed,"
1456,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"For his thoughts as paddles served him,"
1457,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,And his wishes served to guide him;
1458,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Swift or slow at will he glided,"
1459,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Veered to right or left at pleasure.
1460,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1461,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Then he called aloud to Kwasind,"
1462,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,"
1463,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Saying, ""Help me clear this river"
1464,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Of its sunken logs and sand-bars."""
1465,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1466,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Straight into the river Kwasind
1467,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Plunged as if he were an otter,"
1468,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Dived as if he were a beaver,"
1469,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Stood up to his waist in water,"
1470,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"To his arm-pits in the river,"
1471,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Swam and shouted in the river,"
1472,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Tugged at sunken logs and branches,"
1473,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"With his hands he scooped the sand-bars,"
1474,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,With his feet the ooze and tangle.
1475,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1476,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,And thus sailed my Hiawatha
1477,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Down the rushing Taquamenaw,"
1478,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Sailed through all its bends and windings,"
1479,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Sailed through all its deeps and shallows,"
1480,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind,"
1481,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Swam the deeps, the shallows waded."
1482,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,
1483,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Up and down the river went they,"
1484,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"In and out among its islands,"
1485,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar,"
1486,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Dragged the dead trees from its channel,"
1487,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,Made its passage safe and certain
1488,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"Made a pathway for the people,"
1489,HIAWATHA'S SAILING,"From its springs among the mountains,"

2164,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Across the German Ocean,"
2165,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"In a country far from our own,"
2166,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Once, a poor little boy, named Gottlieb,"
2167,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Lived with his mother alone.
2168,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2169,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,They dwelt in the part of a village
2170,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Where the houses were poor and small,"
2171,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"But the home of little Gottlieb,"
2172,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Was the poorest one of all
2173,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2174,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"He was not large enough to work,"
2175,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,And his mother could do no more
2176,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,(Though she scarcely laid her knitting down)
2177,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Than keep the wolf from the door.
2178,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2179,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"She had to take their threadbare clothes,"
2180,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And turn, and patch, and darn;"
2181,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,For never any woman yet
2182,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Grew rich by knitting yarn.
2183,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2184,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And oft at night, beside her chair,"
2185,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Would Gottlieb sit, and plan"
2186,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"The wonderful things he would do for her,"
2187,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,When he grew to be a man.
2188,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2189,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"One night she sat and knitted,"
2190,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And Gottlieb sat and dreamed,"
2191,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,When a happy fancy all at once
2192,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Upon his vision beamed.
2193,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2194,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"'Twas only a week till Christmas,"
2195,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,And Gottlieb knew that then
2196,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"The Christ-child, who was born that day,"
2197,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Sent down good gifts to men.
2198,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2199,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"But he said, ""He will never find us,"
2200,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Our home is so mean and small.
2201,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And we, who have most need of them,"
2202,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Will get no gifts at all."""
2203,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2204,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,When all at once a happy light
2205,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Came into his eyes so blue,"
2206,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And lighted up his face with smiles,"
2207,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,As he thought what he could do.
2208,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2209,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Next day when the postman's letters
2210,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Came from all over the land;
2211,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Came one for the Christ-child, written"
2212,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,In a child's poor trembling hand.
2213,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2214,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,You may think he was sorely puzzled
2215,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,What in the world to do;
2216,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"So he went to the Burgomaster,"
2217,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,As the wisest man he knew.
2218,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2219,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And when they opened the letter,"
2220,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,They stood almost dismayed
2221,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,That such a little child should dare
2222,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,To ask the Lord for aid.
2223,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2224,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Then the Burgomaster stammered,"
2225,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And scarce knew what to speak,"
2226,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,And hastily he brushed aside
2227,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"A drop, like a tear, from his cheek."
2228,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2229,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Then up he spoke right gruffly,"
2230,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,And turned himself about:
2231,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"""This must be a very foolish boy,"
2232,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And a small one, too, no doubt."""
2233,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2234,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,But when six rosy children
2235,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"That night about him pressed,"
2236,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Poor, trusting little Gottlieb"
2237,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Stood near him, with the rest."
2238,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2239,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And he heard his simple, touching prayer,"
2240,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Through all their noisy play;
2241,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Though he tried his very best to put
2242,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,The thought of him away.
2243,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2244,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"A wise and learned man was he,"
2245,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Men called him good and just;
2246,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"But his wisdom seemed like foolishness,"
2247,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,By that weak child's simple trust.
2248,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2249,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Now when the morn of Christmas came
2250,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And the long, long week was done,"
2251,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Poor Gottlieb, who scarce could sleep,"
2252,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Rose up before the sun,"
2253,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2254,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And hastened to his mother,"
2255,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"But he scarce might speak for fear,"
2256,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"When he saw her wondering look, and saw"
2257,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,The Burgomaster near.
2258,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2259,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"He wasn't afraid of the Holy Babe,"
2260,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Nor his mother, meek and mild;"
2261,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,But he felt as if so great a man
2262,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Had never been a child.
2263,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2264,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Amazed the poor child looked, to find"
2265,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"The hearth was piled with wood,"
2266,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And the table, never full before,"
2267,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Was heaped with dainty food.
2268,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2269,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,Then half to hide from himself the truth
2270,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"The Burgomaster said,"
2271,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"While the mother blessed him on her knees,"
2272,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,And Gottlieb shook for dread;
2273,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2274,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"""Nay, give no thanks, my good dame,"
2275,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"To such as me for aid,"
2276,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Be grateful to your little son,"
2277,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"And the Lord to whom he prayed!"""
2278,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2279,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Then turning round to Gottlieb,"
2280,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"""Your written prayer, you see,"
2281,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Came not to whom it was addressed,"
2282,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,It only came to me!
2283,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2284,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"""'Twas but a foolish thing you did,"
2285,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,As you must understand;
2286,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"For though the gifts are yours, you know,"
2287,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"You have them from my hand."""
2288,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,
2289,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Then Gottlieb answered fearlessly,"
2290,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"Where he humbly stood apart,"
2291,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"""But the Christ-child sent them all the same,"
2292,LITTLE GOTTLIEB,"He put the thought in your heart!"""

3981,THE NIGHT WIND,"And ""Who's been bad to-day?"" I'd ask"
3982,THE NIGHT WIND,Of the wind that hoarsely blew;

3984,THE NIGHT WIND,"""Yoooooooo!"

3989,THE NIGHT WIND,"You'll not believe it, though!"
3990,THE NIGHT WIND,"Yes, though I'm quite a model now,"
3991,THE NIGHT WIND,I was not always so.
3992,THE NIGHT WIND,"And if you doubt what things I say,"
3993,THE NIGHT WIND,Suppose you make the test;
3994,THE NIGHT WIND,"Suppose, when you've been bad some day"
3995,THE NIGHT WIND,And up to bed are sent away
3996,THE NIGHT WIND,From mother and the rest--
3997,THE NIGHT WIND,"Suppose you ask, ""Who has been bad?"""
3998,THE NIGHT WIND,And then you'll hear what's true;
3999,THE NIGHT WIND,For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone:

4871,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4872,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"When Solomon was reigning in his glory,"
4873,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Unto his throne the Queen of Sheba came,"
4874,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,(So in the Talmud you may read the story)
4875,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Drawn by the magic of the monarch's fame,"
4876,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"To see the splendors of his court, and bring"
4877,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Some fitting tribute to the mighty king.
4878,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4879,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Nor this alone; much had her Highness heard
4880,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,What flowers of learning graced the royal speech;
4881,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,What gems of wisdom dropped with every word;
4882,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,What wholesome lessons he was wont to teach
4883,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"In pleasing proverbs; and she wished, in sooth,"
4884,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,To know if Rumor spoke the simple truth.
4885,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4886,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Besides, the queen had heard (which piqued her most)"
4887,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,How through the deepest riddles he could spy;
4888,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,How all the curious arts that women boast
4889,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Were quite transparent to his piercing eye;
4890,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,And so the queen had come--a royal guest--
4891,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,To put the sage's cunning to the test.
4892,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4893,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"And straight she held before the monarch's view,"
4894,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"In either hand, a radiant wreath of flowers;"
4895,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"The one, bedecked with every charming hue,"
4896,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Was newly culled from Nature's choicest bowers;
4897,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"The other, no less fair in every part,"
4898,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Was the rare product of divinest Art.
4899,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4900,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"""Which is the true, and which the false?"" she said,"
4901,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Great Solomon was silent. All-amazed,"
4902,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Each wondering courtier shook his puzzled head,"
4903,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"While at the garlands long the monarch gazed,"
4904,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"As one who sees a miracle, and fain,"
4905,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"For very rapture, ne'er would speak again."
4906,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4907,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"""Which is the true?"" once more the woman asked,"
4908,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Pleased at the fond amazement of the king;
4909,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"""So wise a head should not be hardly tasked,"
4910,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Most learned liege, with such a trivial thing!"""
4911,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,But still the sage was silent; it was plain
4912,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,A deepening doubt perplexed the royal brain.
4913,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4914,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"While thus he pondered, presently he sees,"
4915,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Hard by the casement,--so the story goes,--"
4916,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"A little band of busy, bustling bees,"
4917,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Hunting for honey in a withered rose.
4918,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"The monarch smiled, and raised his royal head;"
4919,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"""Open the window!""--that was all he said."
4920,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4921,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,The window opened at the king's command;
4922,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Within the room the eager insects flew,"
4923,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,And sought the flowers in Sheba's dexter hand!
4924,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,And so the king and all the courtiers knew
4925,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,That wreath was Nature's; and the baffled queen
4926,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,Returned to tell the wonders she had seen.
4927,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,
4928,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,My story teaches (every tale should bear
4929,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,A fitting moral) that the wise may find
4930,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"In trifles light as atoms in the air,"
4931,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Some useful lesson to enrich the mind,"
4932,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,"Some truth designed to profit or to please,--"
4933,KING SOLOMON AND THE BEES,As Israel's king learned wisdom from the bees!

5556,THE SONG SPARROW,"Of many colors, smart and gay;"
5557,THE SONG SPARROW,"His suit is Quaker brown and gray,"
5558,THE SONG SPARROW,With darker patches at his throat.
5559,THE SONG SPARROW,"And yet of all the well-dressed throng,"
5560,THE SONG SPARROW,Not one can sing so brave a song.
