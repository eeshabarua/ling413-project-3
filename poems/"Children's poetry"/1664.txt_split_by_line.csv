104,SONGS OF DESIRE,
105,SONGS OF DESIRE,
106,SONGS OF DESIRE,I'd like to be a gypsy
107,SONGS OF DESIRE,"With gold rings in my ears,"
108,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Along the road to sit and sing,"
109,SONGS OF DESIRE,And not do another thing
110,SONGS OF DESIRE,For years and years;
111,SONGS OF DESIRE,
112,SONGS OF DESIRE,"A road to dream upon by day,"
113,SONGS OF DESIRE,"A fire for dreams at night,"
114,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Free to wander far away,"
115,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Free to shout and free to play,"
116,SONGS OF DESIRE,Quite impolite.
117,SONGS OF DESIRE,
118,SONGS OF DESIRE,"I'd pitch my tent beside a wall,"
119,SONGS OF DESIRE,"All apple trees within,"
120,SONGS OF DESIRE,"And if the apples didn't fall,"
121,SONGS OF DESIRE,I wouldn't hesitate at all.
122,SONGS OF DESIRE,I'd climb--and sin!
123,SONGS OF DESIRE,
124,SONGS OF DESIRE,"But if the weather wasn't fine,"
125,SONGS OF DESIRE,"If all the world were rain,"
126,SONGS OF DESIRE,If there weren't anywhere to dine
127,SONGS OF DESIRE,And goose-flesh quivered up my spine--
128,SONGS OF DESIRE,I _might_ come home again!

135,SONGS OF DESIRE,
136,SONGS OF DESIRE,"A frog's a very happy thing,"
137,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Cool and green in early spring,"
138,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Quick and silver through the pool,"
139,SONGS OF DESIRE,With no thought of books or school.
140,SONGS OF DESIRE,
141,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Oh, I want to be a frog,"
142,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Sunning, stretching on a log,"
143,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Blinking there in splendid ease,"
144,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Swimming naked when I please,"
145,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Nosing into magic nooks,"
146,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Quiet marshes, noisy brooks."
147,SONGS OF DESIRE,
148,SONGS OF DESIRE,Free! And fit for anything!

155,SONGS OF DESIRE,
156,SONGS OF DESIRE,
157,SONGS OF DESIRE,If I were a rocket
158,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Shot high across the night,"
159,SONGS OF DESIRE,I'd rather burst in silver stars
160,SONGS OF DESIRE,Than green or purple light;
161,SONGS OF DESIRE,
162,SONGS OF DESIRE,"For then, perhaps, I'd fool the moon,"
163,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Although she's very wise,"
164,SONGS OF DESIRE,And thinking me a baby star
165,SONGS OF DESIRE,She'd keep me in the skies.

170,SONGS OF DESIRE,Dreams
171,SONGS OF DESIRE,
172,SONGS OF DESIRE,
173,SONGS OF DESIRE,"I'd like to dream my own dreams,"
174,SONGS OF DESIRE,Instead of dreaming those
175,SONGS OF DESIRE,The silly sandman brings along
176,SONGS OF DESIRE,Like moving picture shows.
177,SONGS OF DESIRE,
178,SONGS OF DESIRE,"I'd like to dream of palaces,"
179,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Of magic meadowlands,"
180,SONGS OF DESIRE,Of silver gates and golden thrones
181,SONGS OF DESIRE,And chanting fairy bands;
182,SONGS OF DESIRE,
183,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Of seas of spraying jewels,"
184,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Of dancing crystal ships,"
185,SONGS OF DESIRE,Of the queen of all the elves herself--
186,SONGS OF DESIRE,Two rubies for her lips;
187,SONGS OF DESIRE,
188,SONGS OF DESIRE,"But, alas! I never dream such things,"
189,SONGS OF DESIRE,And when I jump and wake
190,SONGS OF DESIRE,As an oozy ogre clutches me--
191,SONGS OF DESIRE,It's just a stomach ache!

196,SONGS OF DESIRE,Water-Lily
197,SONGS OF DESIRE,
198,SONGS OF DESIRE,
199,SONGS OF DESIRE,"I'd like to be a water-lily sleeping on the river,"
200,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Where solemn rushes whisper, and funny ripples quiver."
201,SONGS OF DESIRE,"All day I'd watch the blue sky--all night I'd watch the black,"
202,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Floating in the soft waves, dreaming on my back,"
203,SONGS OF DESIRE,"And when I'd tired of dreaming, I'd call a passing fish,"
204,SONGS OF DESIRE,"""I want to find the sea!"" I'd shout, ""Come!  You can grant my wish!"""
205,SONGS OF DESIRE,
206,SONGS OF DESIRE,"He'd bite me from my moorings, and softly I would slip"
207,SONGS OF DESIRE,To the center of the river like an ocean-going ship.
208,SONGS OF DESIRE,"The waves would laugh upon me.  The wind would blow me fast,"
209,SONGS OF DESIRE,"And oh, what shores and wonders would greet me as I passed!"
210,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Yes, if I were a water-lily, I'd sail to sea in state--"
211,SONGS OF DESIRE,A green frog for my captain--and a dragon-fly for mate!

216,SONGS OF DESIRE,Humor
217,SONGS OF DESIRE,
218,SONGS OF DESIRE,
219,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Have you ever watched the clowns at play,"
220,SONGS OF DESIRE,"White, red and black on circus day?"
221,SONGS OF DESIRE,"They're always very, very gay."
222,SONGS OF DESIRE,I wonder how they stay that way!
223,SONGS OF DESIRE,
224,SONGS OF DESIRE,"I'd like to be a clown,"
225,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Playing tricks around the town,"
226,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Turning somersaults and springs,"
227,SONGS OF DESIRE,"As if they were easy things,"
228,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Laughing morning, noon and night,"
229,SONGS OF DESIRE,Being such a funny sight!
230,SONGS OF DESIRE,
231,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Do you think, then, I'd grow tired of fun,"
232,SONGS OF DESIRE,Laughing so from sun to sun?
233,SONGS OF DESIRE,"Or, when performances are done,"
234,SONGS OF DESIRE,Do clown-folk cry like anyone?

239,SONGS OF DESIRE,Independence
240,SONGS OF DESIRE,
241,SONGS OF DESIRE,
242,SONGS OF DESIRE,I like to go out in the night
243,SONGS OF DESIRE,"When there's neither a sound nor a light,"
244,SONGS OF DESIRE,"With my hands and feet bare,"
245,SONGS OF DESIRE,"And the wind in my hair,"
246,SONGS OF DESIRE,Not a nurse nor a parent in sight;
247,SONGS OF DESIRE,
248,SONGS OF DESIRE,"But only the night, moon and me"
249,SONGS OF DESIRE,"As I dance in the dew joyfully,"
250,SONGS OF DESIRE,Quite daring and bold
251,SONGS OF DESIRE,"For there's no one to scold,"
252,SONGS OF DESIRE,Because there is no one to see.

263,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
264,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
265,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Apple blossoms look like snow,"
266,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"They're different, though."
267,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Snow falls softly, but it brings"
268,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Noisy things:
269,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Sleighs and bells, forts and fights,"
270,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Cosy nights.
271,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
272,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"But apple blossoms when they go,"
273,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"White and slow,"
274,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Quiet all the orchard space,"
275,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Till the place
276,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Hushed with falling sweetness seems
277,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Filled with dreams.

283,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
284,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
285,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I wonder if God sits alone
286,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Upon the highest mountain stone
287,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"To stir the clouds and drop the rain,"
288,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,And then to pick it up again.
289,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
290,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I wonder if he sends the brooks
291,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Foaming from their distant nooks,"
292,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"And, sitting there in robes of gray,"
293,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Turns rivers on at break of day.

299,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
300,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
301,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,The scarlet trumpet flowers are gay
302,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"And yet they never seem to play,"
303,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,They never trumpet up the dawn
304,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Nor blow retreat across the lawn.
305,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
306,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"But oh, to-day I heard a strain,"
307,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"A happy, martial, quick refrain,"
308,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,As down across the garden grass
309,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I saw the marching flowers pass:
310,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
311,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Gaudy phlox and flaunting rose,"
312,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Stiff and straight and on their toes,"
313,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"And, blaring from the garden wall,"
314,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,The trumpet flower led them all.

325,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"All the long day through,"
326,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
327,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"I'd dance among the roses,"
328,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"I'd take a stately walk,"
329,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Balancing precisely
330,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,On an Easter-lily stalk.
331,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
332,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"For play I'd choose the jonquils,"

335,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,The Johnny-jump-ups!
336,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
337,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"But on some quiet evening,"
338,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"I'd leave my fairy band,"
339,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,And on a star-flower through the sky
340,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I'd sail to fairyland.

351,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Was it night or thunder?
352,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
353,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,If I were mother to the moon
354,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I'd spank her every day

365,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Great fleecy ones all filled with light,"

367,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,And little fellows slipping by.
368,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
369,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Sometimes they seem like sheep at play,"
370,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Sometimes when they are dull and gray
371,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"The pale sun seems a ship to me,"
372,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Sailing through a rolling sea;
373,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
374,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"And I've seen faces in them too,"
375,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Funny white men on the blue,"
376,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"They look so many different ways,"
377,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,And not one single cloudlet stays;
378,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
379,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"But on across the heavens they blow,"
380,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"I often wonder where they go,"
381,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Now sometime, maybe when I die,"

390,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,If I were a violet I'd think it a shame
391,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"To be always so simple and modest and tame,"
392,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,To be hidden away like a hermit or nun
393,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,While the hare-brained pink roses can dance in the sun!
394,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,But consider the naughty wild ways of the rose--
395,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"There _must_ be _respectable_ flowers, I suppose!"

401,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
402,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
403,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Why is the lily so stately and still?
404,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Why doesn't she dance like the gay daffodil?
405,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Why doesn't she blush like the rose or the pink,"
406,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Or, like mischievous pansy, indulge in a wink?"
407,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Do you think it's because she is holier than they,"
408,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Or did God just decide he would make her that way?

416,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,My garden was silly and stubborn;
417,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"I worked, but the weeds worked, too;"
418,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I dug and scraped and scrambled--
419,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,They hustled themselves and grew;
420,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
421,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Now Ted's garden's fine and cleanly,"
422,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,He has lettuce and roses and peas--
423,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"Oh, most probably plants are like children--"

432,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,I wonder where the rabbits go
433,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Who leave their tracks across the snow;

435,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,The tracks always start out again.

443,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,High and proud on the barnyard fence
444,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,Walks rooster in the morning.
445,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"He shakes his comb, he shakes his tail"
446,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,And gives his daily warning.
447,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,
448,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"""Get up, you lazy boys and girls,"
449,SONGS FOR OUT OF DOORS,"It's time you should be dressing!"""

947,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"John Chipman Farrar (1896-1974), late of the New York publishing firm of"
948,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux, attended Yale University where his poem"
949,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"""Portraits"" was the Yale University Prize Poem in 1916. After serving"

954,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,a century later.
955,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,
956,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"After graduation, Farrar turned to publishing and literary criticism,"
957,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"editing George H. Doran Company's periodical ""The Bookman"". Between 1927"
958,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"and 1929, Farrar was editor at Doubleday, Doran and Company. In mid-"
959,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"1929, he and two sons of the famous mystery writer Mary Robert Rinehart"
960,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"started the publishing firm if Farrar and Rinehart, Inc. His connection"
961,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"with that firm lasted until 1945, although he was absent during the war"
962,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,years assisting in U.S. government psychological war efforts.  Farrar
963,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,and Rinehart was later absorbed by Henry Holt.
964,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,
965,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"As a young editor in New York, Farrar volunteered in 1922 for the"
966,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"organizing committee of an American chapter of PEN (originally Poets,"
967,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,Essayists and Novelists) founded in England the year before by Sappho
968,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,(Amy Dawson Scott) to foster support of visiting foreign writers. PEN
969,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,grew quickly to become an international advocate for freedom of
970,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,expression and continues its activism to this day. (See

972,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,
973,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"After the Second World War, the American chapter of PEN foundered for"
974,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"lack of direction.  Farrar, co-principal of the newly formed publishing"
975,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"house of Farrar, Straus and Company, now Farrar, Straus and Giroux,"
976,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,stepped in to refocus its energies and recruit dozens of new members. He

978,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,
979,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,"In his roles as both and editor and a publisher, Farrar had a lasting"

981,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,published many Nobel Laureates (20 as of 1995) and dozens of
982,SONGS FOR A CHRISTMAS TREE,distinguished poets and authors.  It is my privilege  to reprint this
