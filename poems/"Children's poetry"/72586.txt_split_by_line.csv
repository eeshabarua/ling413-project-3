91,CHAPTER I.,
92,CHAPTER I.,
93,CHAPTER I.,Many years ago there lived in an ancient castle in England a proud
94,CHAPTER I.,"Baron, who had one child, Ginevra, a little girl named for her mother,"
95,CHAPTER I.,who died the night her baby was born.
96,CHAPTER I.,
97,CHAPTER I.,The servants used to say the Baroness had led a wretched life; that her
98,CHAPTER I.,"lord was harsh and stern at home, as he was fierce and cruel in war;"
99,CHAPTER I.,"but this I do not truly know. He dearly loved his little daughter, and"
100,CHAPTER I.,hours at a time would carry her in his arms and walk up and down the
101,CHAPTER I.,hall before the blazing fires in winter. It was a fair sight to see the
102,CHAPTER I.,"Baron with the baby, in her long white dress, lying on his shoulder,"
103,CHAPTER I.,"her light hair against his rough beard, or to see him dandle her in his"
104,CHAPTER I.,"hand, hard almost as the steel gloves he wore to battle, as if she"
105,CHAPTER I.,were no more than a feather’s weight.
106,CHAPTER I.,
107,CHAPTER I.,"The castle was gloomy and strong, with towers guarded by sentinels,"
108,CHAPTER I.,"and was enclosed by a high wall of stone, beyond which was a deep moat"
109,CHAPTER I.,"filled with water, that could be crossed by only one drawbridge."
110,CHAPTER I.,
111,CHAPTER I.,"Once, when there was war in the land, the King called on all good men"
112,CHAPTER I.,"for help; and the Baron, ready for battle, gathered his people in the"
113,CHAPTER I.,"courtyard to hear his last orders. He held up his sword, dinted by many"
114,CHAPTER I.,"a blow in bloody fight, showed the cross on its hilt, and spoke in a"
115,CHAPTER I.,loud voice:
116,CHAPTER I.,
117,CHAPTER I.,"“Swear by this blessed sign, whatever befall, you will defend Lady"
118,CHAPTER I.,Ginevra to the death!”
119,CHAPTER I.,
120,CHAPTER I.,"And every man lifted his right hand, knelt where he stood, and swore by"
121,CHAPTER I.,the Holy Cross he would defend the Lady Ginevra to the death. He then
122,CHAPTER I.,"mounted his coal-black steed, took the baby from her nurse, and lifted"
123,CHAPTER I.,her in sight of all the crowd. She clapped her hands and laughed to see
124,CHAPTER I.,"the flashing armor and flags embroidered with red roses, and the air"
125,CHAPTER I.,rung with the shout: “Long live the Lady Ginevra!”
126,CHAPTER I.,
127,CHAPTER I.,[Illustration]
128,CHAPTER I.,
129,CHAPTER I.,A fortune-teller had said Ginevra was doomed to sorrow; and this
130,CHAPTER I.,made the Baron watch her with anxious care. There was one soldier whose
131,CHAPTER I.,only duty was to guard his young mistress. Said the Baron to him: “Keep
132,CHAPTER I.,"her always in sight, Ban. While thou wearest that scar on thy brow, I"
133,CHAPTER I.,will remember thou hast saved my life. Some day thou mayest save hers.
134,CHAPTER I.,"She is the last of my name and house, and if evil come upon her, my"
135,CHAPTER I.,"heart will break. Thou art my truest follower, Ban. Whatever else fail,"
136,CHAPTER I.,never lose sight of Lady Ginevra.”
137,CHAPTER I.,
138,CHAPTER I.,"“I will die ere a hair of her head suffer,” said the old retainer,"
139,CHAPTER I.,"stoutly. “A soldier’s scars are his honors, and I will be proud to wear"
140,CHAPTER I.,one for my Lady’s sake.”
141,CHAPTER I.,
142,CHAPTER I.,"So Ban, with spear and sword, was always in sight of his young"
143,CHAPTER I.,"mistress; and at night he lay in the corridor, outside her chamber"
144,CHAPTER I.,"door, his spear against the wall, so that no one could go out or in"
145,CHAPTER I.,without waking him.
146,CHAPTER I.,
147,CHAPTER I.,"The Baron fought well for king and country, and at Christmas rode home"
148,CHAPTER I.,on his coal-black steed. Then there was a mighty feast in the great
149,CHAPTER I.,"hall, and, for two days and nights, whoever chose could eat and drink"
150,CHAPTER I.,of the best.
151,CHAPTER I.,
152,CHAPTER I.,The ladies’ hall was wreathed with evergreens; red berries of holly
153,CHAPTER I.,"shone bright on the old oak wall, and from the center of the ceiling"
154,CHAPTER I.,hung a heavy branch of mistletoe; and every one who passed under it was
155,CHAPTER I.,"sure to be caught and kissed. Plates were laid for a hundred guests,"
156,CHAPTER I.,"and there were oxen roasted whole, and huge pies of venison; and all"
157,CHAPTER I.,"night long was heard the sound of harp and horn, and tread of dancers,"
158,CHAPTER I.,"dancing in tune. Oh! it was a rousing Christmas, and little Ginevra was"
159,CHAPTER I.,the soul and life of it all!
160,CHAPTER I.,
161,CHAPTER I.,"There were few books in those days, and instead of reading, she was"
162,CHAPTER I.,"taught to embroider with silks, to play on the lute, and to sing. She"
163,CHAPTER I.,"was so gentle and gracious, even the bees, the birds, and the swans on"
164,CHAPTER I.,"the lake, knew her, and everything that knew her loved her. So watched,"
165,CHAPTER I.,"and so beloved, fifteen years Ginevra grew,--"
166,CHAPTER I.,
167,CHAPTER I.,“Fair as a star when only one
168,CHAPTER I.,Is shining in the sky.”
169,CHAPTER I.,
170,CHAPTER I.,And the fame of her beauty spread far and wide.
171,CHAPTER I.,
172,CHAPTER I.,"A tranquil life she lived, rarely going beyond the castle, yet loved by"
173,CHAPTER I.,"many who had children of their own, but who freely spoke of Ginevra as"
174,CHAPTER I.,best and dearest where all were near and dear.
175,CHAPTER I.,
176,CHAPTER I.,"“Why, my darling,” said the Baron, “why does everybody love my child?”"
177,CHAPTER I.,
178,CHAPTER I.,"“I do not know,” she answered, with a thoughtful, puzzled look."
179,CHAPTER I.,"“Perhaps,” she added shyly, “it is because I love everybody.”"
180,CHAPTER I.,
181,CHAPTER I.,"“That much nearer heaven than I,” said the father, gazing into the"
182,CHAPTER I.,"picture-like face, with the mild look which never came into his own"
183,CHAPTER I.,except for her. “The angels in heaven can do no more.”
184,CHAPTER I.,
185,CHAPTER I.,"Her fresh, light rooms, the only cheerful ones in the dismal stone"
186,CHAPTER I.,"pile, opened out on a broad balcony, filled with plants; fluttering"
187,CHAPTER I.,"leaves, speckled shadows, sweet-smelling flowers, through which the sun"
188,CHAPTER I.,"at setting poured his last, last rays, as lingering through the late"
189,CHAPTER I.,twilight to kiss her pure forehead once more. The blessed sunlight! You
190,CHAPTER I.,might think some of its brightness was tangled in the golden head which
191,CHAPTER I.,"glanced among the flowers, and that their sweetness had passed into her"
192,CHAPTER I.,soul.
193,CHAPTER I.,
194,CHAPTER I.,"It was the Baron’s study to smooth from her path every care and trial,"
195,CHAPTER I.,and to temper every wind that blew past her. The walls round the
196,CHAPTER I.,courtyard below the balcony were so high it was sheltered from the
197,CHAPTER I.,"coldest blasts, so that birds sang in the bare, leafless thickets of"
198,CHAPTER I.,shrubbery as though it were always spring; and all the year round it
199,CHAPTER I.,was a delightful playground.
200,CHAPTER I.,
201,CHAPTER I.,"In summer, with her little maid, Geta, she used to play hide and seek"
202,CHAPTER I.,"in the alleys of the rose garden, where the roses were all red--the"
203,CHAPTER I.,Baron would not have a white one among them--and as the quick color
204,CHAPTER I.,"came and went in her face, he would say:"
205,CHAPTER I.,
206,CHAPTER I.,"“My child, the roses are ever at war in thy cheek.”"
207,CHAPTER I.,
208,CHAPTER I.,"“Yes, father; but thou sayest the red always wins.”"
209,CHAPTER I.,
210,CHAPTER I.,"“So it does, dear heart, and so it shall. No white leaf for us! The red"
211,CHAPTER I.,rose forever! When I miss it from thy face the sweetness of my life is
212,CHAPTER I.,gone; and thou must wear one for me ever in thy hair.”
213,CHAPTER I.,
214,CHAPTER I.,"Near the castle wall was a dark forest, of which awful tales were told;"
215,CHAPTER I.,"how it was full of robber caves, and dens, and dim paths leading into"
216,CHAPTER I.,"snares and pitfalls, and among roaring wild beasts that were forever"
217,CHAPTER I.,seeking what they might devour.
218,CHAPTER I.,
219,CHAPTER I.,The sentinel on the bridge said he would rather fight the infidel all
220,CHAPTER I.,"day than venture into the forest after sundown. Close to its edge, in"
221,CHAPTER I.,"the shade of giant oaks, was a fountain of marble, with water playing"
222,CHAPTER I.,"night and day, cold as ice, clear as glass. And here, one summer"
223,CHAPTER I.,"afternoon, Ginevra strayed with Geta. Her feet scarcely bent the"
224,CHAPTER I.,"daisies in her path; the breeze tossed her flossy locks, where the red"
225,CHAPTER I.,"rose shone like a jewel; and, as old Ban stalked behind her, like a"
226,CHAPTER I.,"tall black shadow, he thought he had never seen his Lady so lovely."
227,CHAPTER I.,
228,CHAPTER I.,"When they reached the fountain, Geta tried to tune the lute, but could"
229,CHAPTER I.,"not play till Ginevra brought the silver strings together; and, as she"
230,CHAPTER I.,"touched its chords, a fierce stag-hound sprang out of the forest so"
231,CHAPTER I.,"suddenly, she dropped the lute and screamed for fear."
232,CHAPTER I.,
233,CHAPTER I.,"Quick as lightning, Ban was before her, and in another moment would"
234,CHAPTER I.,"have split the dog’s skull, but a voice shouted:"
235,CHAPTER I.,
236,CHAPTER I.,“Stay! Stay! He will not harm any one!”
237,CHAPTER I.,
238,CHAPTER I.,"Ban stood still, but lowered not his lance. Presently, a youth, mounted"
239,CHAPTER I.,"on a milk-white steed, rode up, called the hound to his feet, gave his"
240,CHAPTER I.,"horse’s bridle to a page, who followed on a red roan, and then he knelt"
241,CHAPTER I.,before Ginevra and quieted her fears.
242,CHAPTER I.,
243,CHAPTER I.,"I do not know how it came to pass, but these four were soon talking"
244,CHAPTER I.,"as if they had been friends all their days, and there was nothing in"
245,CHAPTER I.,the wide world but their own innocent young hearts. They tried their
246,CHAPTER I.,fortune by dropping bay-leaves in the water. Then they sat on mossy
247,CHAPTER I.,"roots, and Ginevra sang of the lady who was heartbroken and drowned"
248,CHAPTER I.,herself in the fountain for her own true love; and how her spirit rises
249,CHAPTER I.,"and floats in the air above it, like a mist at evening."
250,CHAPTER I.,
251,CHAPTER I.,"“Thy song is too sad, Lady,” said the youth. “Let me have the lute.”"
252,CHAPTER I.,
253,CHAPTER I.,"With a free hand, he struck the strings, and sang of King Arthur"
254,CHAPTER I.,"and his bold knights, and of the daring deeds they did, whose like"
255,CHAPTER I.,"England has never seen since his time; no, nor never will, till Arthur"
256,CHAPTER I.,"comes again. Then he turned his eyes--steel-blue eyes, flashing like"
257,CHAPTER I.,"a sword-blade--toward Ginevra, and sang of love in such strain she"
258,CHAPTER I.,thought the fountain stopped its splashing and the trees bent their
259,CHAPTER I.,"heads to listen. When the last echo of his voice died away, Ban spoke"
260,CHAPTER I.,"out, and said:"
261,CHAPTER I.,
262,CHAPTER I.,"“My Lady, an’ it please you, my lord, the Baron has forbidden us to"
263,CHAPTER I.,stay outside the wall after nightfall.”
264,CHAPTER I.,
265,CHAPTER I.,"“But, Ban, he knows thou art between me and danger. Still, the forest’s"
266,CHAPTER I.,"shades grow dark, and I see thou art right. The sun is nearly set.”"
267,CHAPTER I.,
268,CHAPTER I.,"Then the youth whispered something in her ear, and Ginevra, blushing"
269,CHAPTER I.,"brightly, said:"
270,CHAPTER I.,
271,CHAPTER I.,"“Never, never!”"
272,CHAPTER I.,
273,CHAPTER I.,"“Give me a favor to wear--the rose from thy hair, sweet lady. I, too,"
274,CHAPTER I.,belong to the house and banner of the red.”
275,CHAPTER I.,
276,CHAPTER I.,"She loosed it from her shining tresses; he kissed the flower, put it in"
277,CHAPTER I.,"his bosom, and said:"
278,CHAPTER I.,
279,CHAPTER I.,“I would not give one of the least of these leaves for the King’s
280,CHAPTER I.,crown.”
281,CHAPTER I.,
282,CHAPTER I.,"Lightly he sprung to the saddle, without so much as touching his"
283,CHAPTER I.,"horse’s neck, lifted his plumed cap, and, followed by the page, on the"
284,CHAPTER I.,"red roan, dashed away into the forest. Ginevra and Geta watched them"
285,CHAPTER I.,"disappear among the black shadows, and then turned and sighed, they"
286,CHAPTER I.,knew not why.
287,CHAPTER I.,
288,CHAPTER I.,The Baron met them outside the castle gate.
289,CHAPTER I.,
290,CHAPTER I.,"“Where hast thou been, my child?” he asked."
291,CHAPTER I.,
292,CHAPTER I.,"“By Edith’s fountain, father.”"
293,CHAPTER I.,
294,CHAPTER I.,“And didst thou drop thy rose in it?”
295,CHAPTER I.,
296,CHAPTER I.,"“No; I gave it to a youth who begged it,” she answered, blushing."
297,CHAPTER I.,
298,CHAPTER I.,"“Ha! And thou hast brought back two,” he said, “and they are both for"
299,CHAPTER I.,"me, my summer child.”"
300,CHAPTER I.,
301,CHAPTER I.,And he kissed her on each cheek.
302,CHAPTER I.,
303,CHAPTER I.,"The color ran up to her forehead, and as she stood in the rosy sunset,"
304,CHAPTER I.,"with downcast eyes, in the bloom and glow of youth so beautiful, the"
305,CHAPTER I.,old Baron’s heart yearned toward his daughter. He gathered her in his
306,CHAPTER I.,"arms, and said:"
307,CHAPTER I.,
308,CHAPTER I.,"“I will carry thee home, little one. Thou art my Rose of the World; for"
309,CHAPTER I.,"there is none on earth like thee. As we go, thou shalt tell me of this"
310,CHAPTER I.,youth. Did he ride a milk-white steed?”
311,CHAPTER I.,
312,CHAPTER I.,"“Yes; a high, proud one; not a single black hair on him; its mane swam"
313,CHAPTER I.,"the wind, and its trappings were of scarlet and gold.”"
314,CHAPTER I.,
315,CHAPTER I.,"“A goodly youth, with spurs; was he not?”"
316,CHAPTER I.,
317,CHAPTER I.,“Yes; his hair was black as the wing of the night raven. He had a noble
318,CHAPTER I.,"air, and oh! an eye that takes your breath!”"
319,CHAPTER I.,
320,CHAPTER I.,"“And his page, Ginevra?”"
321,CHAPTER I.,
322,CHAPTER I.,"“A comely little page, but nothing like his master.”"
323,CHAPTER I.,
324,CHAPTER I.,Here Geta made as if she would speak; her mistress went on:
325,CHAPTER I.,
326,CHAPTER I.,"“But nothing like his master, who carried a bow, a quiver of arrows,"
327,CHAPTER I.,and a silver bugle-horn.”
328,CHAPTER I.,
329,CHAPTER I.,"“It is young Lord Lovel!” He was silent a moment. “How old art thou, my"
330,CHAPTER I.,daughter?”
331,CHAPTER I.,
332,CHAPTER I.,"“Sixteen, come Christmas.”"
333,CHAPTER I.,
334,CHAPTER I.,"Then the Baron fell into a muse, and walked on, carrying her all the"
335,CHAPTER I.,way.
336,CHAPTER I.,
337,CHAPTER I.,"After supper he sat beside her in the hall, playing idly with her hand,"
338,CHAPTER I.,that was soft as the down on the dove’s breast; and at last he said:
339,CHAPTER I.,
340,CHAPTER I.,"“Sweet child, tell me, dost thou know aught of love--young love, I"
341,CHAPTER I.,"mean, not father’s love?”"
342,CHAPTER I.,
343,CHAPTER I.,"“I have sung it in song, and heard it in story,” she answered timidly."
344,CHAPTER I.,
345,CHAPTER I.,"“Listen, then. Lord Lovel is thy betrothed. Thou wert promised to him"
346,CHAPTER I.,"in the cradle; but we fathers have kept the secret, and let true love"
347,CHAPTER I.,"find its own, as it is certain to do, and has done to-day. On thy"
348,CHAPTER I.,sixteenth birthday we will have the betrothal feast. Now go to sleep
349,CHAPTER I.,and dreams that maidens often have ere they reach thy age.”
350,CHAPTER I.,
351,CHAPTER I.,"Ginevra’s chamber was a lofty room, with curtained bed so high it could"
352,CHAPTER I.,be reached only by steps. Geta slept in a cot beside her. They usually
353,CHAPTER I.,"fell asleep at dark, and awoke at daybreak, but that night there was"
354,CHAPTER I.,"no slumber in their eyelids, and the tall clock on the stairs struck"
355,CHAPTER I.,"midnight ere they ceased to talk of the winsome young lord, and his"
356,CHAPTER I.,"gallant little page, Alfred."
357,CHAPTER I.,
358,CHAPTER I.,"Turning on the stone floor in the corridor outside, Ban heard the"
359,CHAPTER I.,"murmur of voices under the door, and the shrewd soldier smiled in the"
360,CHAPTER I.,"dark, and winked his one eye, as he said to himself:"
361,CHAPTER I.,
362,CHAPTER I.,“That arrow was double-headed. It’s all over with my Lady and that
363,CHAPTER I.,forward little Geta.”

371,CHAPTER II.,
372,CHAPTER II.,
373,CHAPTER II.,Four weeks before the next Christmas the Baron proclaimed there would
374,CHAPTER II.,be good cheer for all comers two days and nights at the castle. And
375,CHAPTER II.,"when the time came, the bell on the tower, which sounded only for"
376,CHAPTER II.,"births, deaths, and weddings, rung merrily through the frosty air,"
377,CHAPTER II.,"bonfires were lighted on the hills, the fountain ran wine, and every"
378,CHAPTER II.,man who chose might put in his cup and drink his fill. Outside the wall
379,CHAPTER II.,"were crowds of men gaming, wrestling, and trying their strength, and a"
380,CHAPTER II.,few bloody noses and a cracked skull or two; but that was nothing in
381,CHAPTER II.,those rough times.
382,CHAPTER II.,
383,CHAPTER II.,"In the hall were knights and earls wearing belt, spur, and plume; gay"
384,CHAPTER II.,"ladies in velvets, with sweeping trains; and children pages, and pert"
385,CHAPTER II.,"maids, who did nothing but stand under the mistletoe; and then what"
386,CHAPTER II.,"kissing, what blushing, what shouts, what laughter! The sun never shone"
387,CHAPTER II.,on so merry a Christmas!
388,CHAPTER II.,
389,CHAPTER II.,"Instead of the red rose, Ginevra wore a coronet of pearls; and in that"
390,CHAPTER II.,"goodly company her beauty shone like a star, the brightest where ten"
391,CHAPTER II.,thousand are.
392,CHAPTER II.,
393,CHAPTER II.,[Illustration]
394,CHAPTER II.,
395,CHAPTER II.,"The ladies’ hall was a lordly room, with long rows of columns, wreathed"
396,CHAPTER II.,with garlands; and there the guests assembled at night. As they walked
397,CHAPTER II.,"together, Ginevra said to Lord Lovel:"
398,CHAPTER II.,
399,CHAPTER II.,“I will give thee a weary chase for me some day. I will frighten thee
400,CHAPTER II.,now.”
401,CHAPTER II.,
402,CHAPTER II.,"And, with a bound, she darted from column to column, and was out of"
403,CHAPTER II.,"sight. Vexed and troubled, Lovel flew after her. He was swift as a"
404,CHAPTER II.,"deer, but could not overtake her; and in the midst of the chase, she"
405,CHAPTER II.,"stole behind and touched him on the shoulder, laughing merrily at his"
406,CHAPTER II.,fears.
407,CHAPTER II.,
408,CHAPTER II.,"“Promise me, sweetheart,” said he, “thou wilt never fly from me again,"
409,CHAPTER II.,till thou spread thy white wings for Heaven. Even Ban lost his breath
410,CHAPTER II.,trying to follow thee.”
411,CHAPTER II.,
412,CHAPTER II.,"“I will not promise,” she said, shaking her sunny ringlets. “I love"
413,CHAPTER II.,"to tease too well. Ban says my feet have wings, and with them I find"
414,CHAPTER II.,hiding-places where no one can follow.”
415,CHAPTER II.,
416,CHAPTER II.,“I fear thou wilt be lost in some of these dark passages; no one living
417,CHAPTER II.,understands all their windings; but I’ll hide thee next Christmas!”
418,CHAPTER II.,
419,CHAPTER II.,"“Where, my Lord? In the donjon keep, behind the iron gratings?”"
420,CHAPTER II.,
421,CHAPTER II.,"“A safer place than that. In my heart, sweet love. There I’ll shut thee"
422,CHAPTER II.,"up, and keep thee safe forever and a day.”"
423,CHAPTER II.,
424,CHAPTER II.,"Then he gave a close kiss, and did not take his eyes off her till it"
425,CHAPTER II.,was time to part.
426,CHAPTER II.,
427,CHAPTER II.,"When the night was far spent, a strange minstrel came to the door, and"
428,CHAPTER II.,"begged to look, if but for one moment, on the Lady Ginevra."
429,CHAPTER II.,
430,CHAPTER II.,"He was old and poor, and shook with cold. Room was made for him by the"
431,CHAPTER II.,"fire; and when he had eaten and drank, he lifted his harp, and, moving"
432,CHAPTER II.,"back from the crowd, passed under the mistletoe. Now, it was a great"
433,CHAPTER II.,"slight for one to do this and not be kissed, and, of course, nobody"
434,CHAPTER II.,"wanted to kiss an old beggar. He heard the laugh and jeer, and, looking"
435,CHAPTER II.,"up, saw the green branch; then his head sunk on his breast with shame."
436,CHAPTER II.,"Ginevra saw it, and snatched an ivy wreath, and stepped toward him,"
437,CHAPTER II.,"saying playfully,"
438,CHAPTER II.,
439,CHAPTER II.,“Kneel down!”
440,CHAPTER II.,
441,CHAPTER II.,He knelt and kissed the hem of her robe. Not even she was ever more
442,CHAPTER II.,beautiful than then.
443,CHAPTER II.,
444,CHAPTER II.,"“I crown thy harp, and call thee knight”--she touched his shoulder. “Be"
445,CHAPTER II.,"thou wise, brave, and tuneful. Rise, Sir Minstrel, and let these lords"
446,CHAPTER II.,and ladies hear thy bravest harping.”
447,CHAPTER II.,
448,CHAPTER II.,For a moment the old man was overcome. Then he swept the harp with such
449,CHAPTER II.,skill and grace there was instant silence. He sang:
450,CHAPTER II.,
451,GINEVRA.,GINEVRA.
452,GINEVRA.,
453,GINEVRA.,"He had heard of her beauty, but the half had not been told; what his"
454,GINEVRA.,eyes had this night seen would ever be a part of sight; his hand was
455,GINEVRA.,"weak and old, but so long as he could touch a string it should be to"
456,GINEVRA.,her name; and at his dying hour thought of her tender pity would warm
457,GINEVRA.,his heart as it had never warmed with wine.
458,GINEVRA.,
459,GINEVRA.,Praises ran through the crowd; the Baron sent Alfred with a purse of
460,GINEVRA.,"broad gold pieces, but the minstrel put it back with a smile, and"
461,GINEVRA.,"unclasped the ragged cloak; down dropped hood, mask, and gray hair; out"
462,GINEVRA.,"stepped a youth, tall, straight, and handsome; on his neck a sparkling"
463,GINEVRA.,chain the Baron knew right well.
464,GINEVRA.,
465,GINEVRA.,“It is Prince Edward! Long live the Prince!” he exclaimed.
466,GINEVRA.,
467,GINEVRA.,"And every man knelt and shouted, till the arches rang,"
468,GINEVRA.,
469,GINEVRA.,“Long live Prince Edward!”
470,GINEVRA.,
471,GINEVRA.,"He bowed his thanks, and lightly touched the harp again. His fingers"
472,GINEVRA.,"strayed uncertainly among the strings, like one busy with memory; a"
473,GINEVRA.,"moment more, and he seemed to catch the melody, and, resting his"
474,GINEVRA.,"burning glance upon Ginevra’s fair face, he sang:"
475,GINEVRA.,
476,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.
477,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
478,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“In blinding snow, as wild winds blow,"
479,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"I left the forest’s gloom,"
480,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"And, following sounds that change the night"
481,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"To brightness and to bloom,"
482,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
483,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“I’ve found where all sweet flowers live,"
484,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Where summer sings and never dies,"
485,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Its roses, Lady, on thy cheek,"
486,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Its violets in thine eyes.
487,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
488,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,“The harp and sword I bring to thee
489,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Are not an offering meet;
490,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"With them, my hand and England’s crown,"
491,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,I lay before thy feet.
492,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
493,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“O, Lady, like the evening star,"
494,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Bend to me now or never;
495,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"For I will see thee ne’er again,"
496,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Unless I see thee ever.”
497,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
498,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Then the Prince led Ginevra to the dance, and it was whispered she was"
499,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"fit to be a queen; but the Baron shook his head, even in that proud"
500,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"hour, and said:"
501,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
502,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,“She must wed whom she will. I cannot force her heart.”
503,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
504,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"When the holidays were ended, Lovel set off to Holy Land, to be gone a"
505,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"twelvemonth and a day. Ginevra wept bitterly, but promised to keep true"
506,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"heart and constant mind till he should come home, never, day nor night,"
507,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,to leave her more.
508,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
509,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,The King’s son tarried and wooed her with words women love to hear; but
510,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,she quietly said:
511,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
512,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“I will wed my own true love, or die a nun.”"
513,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
514,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"He prayed her to give him a favor, a scarf, a glove, a ring; but no;"
515,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"she spoke so firmly he saw it was useless to stay longer, and went"
516,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"away, swearing he would spring into the Thames or the depths of the"
517,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"sea, and drown himself."
518,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
519,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Ginevra watched a splendid train escort him through the forest, and"
520,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"when it was out of sight, said:"
521,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
522,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“Ban, dost thou think he will kill himself? It would be a sad thing to"
523,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,lose our Crown Prince.”
524,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
525,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Ban smiled grimly; he had been a wild one, but was tame enough now."
526,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
527,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“Lady Ginevra,” he said, “ever since the world was made, men have died"
528,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love. Prince"
529,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Edward’s heart is sound; he will marry in less than a twelvemonth and a
530,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,day.”
531,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
532,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,And so he did.
533,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
534,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,Now there were many curious things about this castle which have not
535,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"been mentioned. In the bell-tower, so high, it seemed to touch the sky,"
536,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"lived a crow, said to be a hundred years old, and an owl that hooted"
537,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"at night, and winked and blinked by day. There were lonesome cells"
538,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,where monks used to live; narrow corridors and winding ways easy to be
539,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,lost in; and secret doors in odd places where you would never think of
540,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,looking for a door; but Ginevra knew every dark corner from turret to
541,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"foundation; in every black closet her bright eyes had peered, and under"
542,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,every hidden archway her fairy feet had glided along.
543,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
544,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,[Illustration]
545,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
546,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Looking from the highest tower of the castle, a dim line of heavenly"
547,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,blue marked the Ocean. More than any other view Ginevra loved that.
548,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"When the day was fine, she could see the curlews and herons in the"
549,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"glancing light, and almost hear their screaming and the lapping of the"
550,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,water among the stones of the pebbly shore. Sometimes it showed as many
551,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"tints as though the sea-shells from the depths had swum to the surface,"
552,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"opened to the sun, and floated on the top of the waters like many"
553,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"colored blossoms. And when the sun went down it was a path of gold, a"
554,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"splendor like the pathways of angels. In calm or storm, in leaden sky"
555,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"or roseate light, through every change, Ginevra loved the sea. Ban used"
556,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"to watch her to the top of the tower, and grumble and mutter: “My Lady"
557,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,will come to grief all along of her skipping and racing into strange
558,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,places. She’ll be sorry for it some day.”
559,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
560,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"“Is it so very hard, my good Ban,” she would say, laughing at him, “for"
561,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"a strong soldier, who fought in Flanders, to follow one girl over one"
562,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,house?”
563,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
564,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"And he would bow and smile back again, as he said:"
565,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
566,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,“I was only thinking of my Lady’s safe keeping. There’s no tiring me.
567,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"No, no, no! I would march my feet off for her.”"
568,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
569,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"So petted and guarded, so gay and full of pleasantness was her life,"
570,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,that every day of the year was happy as a birthday.
571,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
572,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,The Baron did not worry Ginevra with teachers and grammars. He did not
573,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"think much of book knowledge, calling it a weariness of the flesh,"
574,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"and a wiser man than any Baron called it that, three thousand years"
575,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"ago. Nor was her nurse allowed to tell her frightful tales, though the"
576,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,old woman liked nothing better than to scare the servants with ghost
577,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"stories in windy nights. Her orders were to tell no Christmas stories,"
578,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,except such as the Bible told; and she used to show a book with
579,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"pictures of the Holy Family, the shepherds listening to the angels’"
580,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"songs, heard but once on earth, and the flight into Egypt. This last"
581,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"was a very choice engraving of Mary, the Virgin Mother, asleep under"
582,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"a palm-tree, and baby angels bending back the leaves, smiling sunnily"
583,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"down on the Divine Child, whose light lightened the bank of lilies"
584,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,where they lay. Then the nurse would explain how the Mother of Christ
585,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"still lives, and is always near motherless children, listening to their"
586,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,prayers and waiting to comfort them. And Ginevra loved the tale and
587,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"believed it, and never spoke a word she would not wish the Holy Mother"
588,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,to hear.
589,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
590,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"In those good old times people played and laughed more than we do, and"
591,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,a first-rate story-teller was better thought of than a fine musician
592,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,nowadays.
593,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
594,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"So, with play and needlework, time went on. Knights, earls, and"
595,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,gentlemen tried to win Ginevra from her vows; but she sent them away
596,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,more madly in love than when they came to offer hand and heart. At the
597,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"hour when the nightingale sings, minstrels and lovesick troubadours"
598,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,harped under her lattice; but she kept true heart and constant
599,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"mind, and when six months had passed, a carrier-dove--a tame, fond"
600,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"thing--flew to the balcony, bearing a letter tied around its neck,"
601,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"sealed with red, and stamped with a rose. It was from Lord Lovel, who"
602,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,wrote he would be home Christmas.
603,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,
604,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,The Baron went to London for her wedding-clothes. They were rich and
605,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,rare as any princess’s; her veil was like silver mist; but nothing was
606,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"so fine as a pair of slippers of white velvet, embroidered with pearls."
607,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,"Had you seen them, you would have said they were for some little child."
608,PRINCE EDWARD’S SONG.,

614,CHAPTER III.,CHAPTER III.
615,CHAPTER III.,
616,CHAPTER III.,
617,CHAPTER III.,"Christmas came, and home came Lord Lovel on his milk-white steed."
618,CHAPTER III.,
619,CHAPTER III.,The night before the wedding the Baron brought to Ginevra a curiously
620,CHAPTER III.,carved ivory box.
621,CHAPTER III.,
622,CHAPTER III.,"“This is thy mother’s wedding gift,” said he. “Now is the time to open"
623,CHAPTER III.,it.”
624,CHAPTER III.,
625,CHAPTER III.,He took from his purse a small gold key. Ginevra turned the lock. The
626,CHAPTER III.,"lid flew up, and showed a heap of strung pearls, each one large as a"
627,CHAPTER III.,robin’s egg.
628,CHAPTER III.,
629,CHAPTER III.,"“They are beautiful!” exclaimed Ginevra, in delight."
630,CHAPTER III.,
631,CHAPTER III.,“Beautiful!” echoed Geta.
632,CHAPTER III.,
633,CHAPTER III.,"“Yes,” said the Baron. “Their like is not in old England. I bought them"
634,CHAPTER III.,"at Constantinople, when I was returning from Palestine.”"
635,CHAPTER III.,
636,CHAPTER III.,"He lifted the long rope, and wound it round his daughter’s neck."
637,CHAPTER III.,
638,CHAPTER III.,"“They are fair, my darling,” said he, tenderly, “but thy throat is"
639,CHAPTER III.,fairer.”
640,CHAPTER III.,
641,CHAPTER III.,"Ginevra looked dreamily at the jewel-case; then, turning her eyes"
642,CHAPTER III.,"inquiringly to her father’s, she suddenly asked:"
643,CHAPTER III.,
644,CHAPTER III.,“Was my mother happy?”
645,CHAPTER III.,
646,CHAPTER III.,"“Happy in that she died young,” answered the Baron, gloomily."
647,CHAPTER III.,
648,CHAPTER III.,"“Wouldst thou say that of me?” she asked, in wondering sadness."
649,CHAPTER III.,
650,CHAPTER III.,"“No, sweet child. Thou art dear to me as the blood-drops of my heart;"
651,CHAPTER III.,"and had I as many lives as thou hast hairs on thy head, I would give"
652,CHAPTER III.,"every one of them for thee, my precious pearl. But no more of this!"
653,CHAPTER III.,"See, here is thy wedding-ring, my gift to thy mother, engraved with the"
654,CHAPTER III.,name of both--Ginevra. I had it from a Jew in Venice. He said it bore a
655,CHAPTER III.,"charm, and always brought good fortune to the wearer. And so it has; it"
656,CHAPTER III.,has brought me thee.”
657,CHAPTER III.,
658,CHAPTER III.,"Ginevra laid the jewels back on the violet velvet lining, and was soon"
659,CHAPTER III.,chatting gayly with Geta; but the Baron was restless and uneasy. When
660,CHAPTER III.,he said good-night he strained her to his heart and kissed her again
661,CHAPTER III.,"and again, as if it were a last parting; then he doubled the guards of"
662,CHAPTER III.,"the castle, walked the great hall, and made the grand rounds like one"
663,CHAPTER III.,whose anxious thoughts will not let him rest.
664,CHAPTER III.,
665,CHAPTER III.,"Ginevra’s quick eye marked the movements of the Baron, and she waited"
666,CHAPTER III.,"till he rested a moment in his favorite seat by the chimney-corner,"
667,CHAPTER III.,"and, seating herself on the heavy arm of the oaken chair, she said:"
668,CHAPTER III.,
669,CHAPTER III.,"“Is my father troubled to-night? Tell me what the trouble is, and I may"
670,CHAPTER III.,chase it away.”
671,CHAPTER III.,
672,CHAPTER III.,"“No, no, little one,” answered the Baron, making an effort to smile,"
673,CHAPTER III.,“but--”
674,CHAPTER III.,
675,CHAPTER III.,"“But what? Go on! What, father?”"
676,CHAPTER III.,
677,CHAPTER III.,"“Only this, dearest. Art thou sure of being perfectly happy?”"
678,CHAPTER III.,
679,CHAPTER III.,“Entirely sure; but I could not be if Lovel should take me from thee.”
680,CHAPTER III.,"She patted his cheek, then touched her blooming mouth to it."
681,CHAPTER III.,
682,CHAPTER III.,"“He will not come between us, child. Nothing on earth, nothing outside"
683,CHAPTER III.,"of heaven, can do that. But listen, what a fearful night! How the sea"
684,CHAPTER III.,"rises, like a fierce beast chained, roaring for its prey! The coast"
685,CHAPTER III.,will show wrecks to-morrow.”
686,CHAPTER III.,
687,CHAPTER III.,"“And is it that which makes thee so uneasy, so sorry?”"
688,CHAPTER III.,
689,CHAPTER III.,"“No; but the raging swell, which we hear here as a weak moaning, stirs"
690,CHAPTER III.,"strange thoughts and brings up strange scenes, vanished long ago. The"
691,CHAPTER III.,"sea has changing voices. Now as we listen, I hear great guns booming"
692,CHAPTER III.,"shot and shell, the rush of thousands of feet, the tramp of armies"
693,CHAPTER III.,"fighting. I loved it when I was a young man; but it is not the same,"
694,CHAPTER III.,because I am not the same. Then it spoke to me of the future; now it
695,CHAPTER III.,is all of the past. As I hold your dear hand”--he touched the pinky
696,CHAPTER III.,finger-tips to his lips as he spoke--“I am hearing a text my mother
697,CHAPTER III.,taught me (God rest her soul!): “Boast not thyself of to-morrow.”
698,CHAPTER III.,
699,CHAPTER III.,“But you have not boasted.”
700,CHAPTER III.,
701,CHAPTER III.,"“No; we seem over-confident, and there is a happiness that makes my"
702,CHAPTER III.,soul afraid. Look out!”--he pointed to the window--“I thought I saw
703,CHAPTER III.,"something pale, a tall shape fly by the window. There! Now!”"
704,CHAPTER III.,
705,CHAPTER III.,"“You might have seen a pale shape half an hour ago in the dusk, where"
706,CHAPTER III.,"the sun left a little light. It is all black darkness now.” She rose,"
707,CHAPTER III.,"drew aside the curtain, and knelt on the deep window-sill among the"
708,CHAPTER III.,roses. “I see nothing but dark. The wind howls like a mad thing in the
709,CHAPTER III.,"air, trying locks and bolts to get in. Sad for the poor sailors and"
710,CHAPTER III.,"their wives waiting at home. Maybe they will never come back, poor"
711,CHAPTER III.,things!”
712,CHAPTER III.,
713,CHAPTER III.,"She returned to her place beside the Baron, who looked silently into"
714,CHAPTER III.,"the fire; her pretty head drooped on his shoulder, and he leaned his"
715,CHAPTER III.,"cheek to hers, her hand in his."
716,CHAPTER III.,
717,CHAPTER III.,"“My daughter!” he said, in a tone he never used to aught on earth but"
718,CHAPTER III.,her.
719,CHAPTER III.,
720,CHAPTER III.,"“My father!” she answered, softly as a wind-harp sounds."
721,CHAPTER III.,
722,CHAPTER III.,“I would have my baby once more.”
723,CHAPTER III.,
724,CHAPTER III.,He turned to the maid:
725,CHAPTER III.,
726,CHAPTER III.,"“Geta, go get your mistress ready for bed. Wrap her in my Siberian"
727,CHAPTER III.,mantle. She shall rest to-night in the arms which were her first
728,CHAPTER III.,"cradle, and I shall rock her to sleep.”"
729,CHAPTER III.,
730,CHAPTER III.,Ginevra laughed. “I can easily be a child again. I have only to go a
731,CHAPTER III.,"few steps backward,” and she disappeared with Geta."
732,CHAPTER III.,
733,CHAPTER III.,A moment later she was robed in a snow-white mantle which muffled her
734,CHAPTER III.,"from head to foot. And, like a wintry fairy, she passed her chamber"
735,CHAPTER III.,"door, where her father stood waiting. He caught her up from the floor."
736,CHAPTER III.,
737,CHAPTER III.,"“Take care of the baby feet,” he said. “These floors are never warm."
738,CHAPTER III.,"Thou art all fair, my love. We will not go below. We will sit in the"
739,CHAPTER III.,brown parlor.”
740,CHAPTER III.,
741,CHAPTER III.,"This was a small room adjoining Ginevra’s bedroom, where there was"
742,CHAPTER III.,"a cumbrous chair, called Prince Rupert’s, which was shaped like a"
743,CHAPTER III.,throne. The walls were made strange with portraits--men in queer
744,CHAPTER III.,"costumes looking stiff and ghastly, women rigid as pasteboard, except"
745,CHAPTER III.,"the picture of one young girl in long bodice and flowing skirt, around"
746,CHAPTER III.,"her hounds and huntsmen, a hawk on her wrist, her horse at hand ready"
747,CHAPTER III.,for mounting--a lovely lady. This was Ginevra’s mother; and she loved
748,CHAPTER III.,"the portrait, and always kept a lamp of perfumed oil burning below it."
749,CHAPTER III.,
750,CHAPTER III.,The fire was low and ashy in the big fire-place. The Baron blew a
751,CHAPTER III.,"silver whistle, and while waiting for a servant to answer the call, he"
752,CHAPTER III.,"kicked together the chunks of logs, sending a train of fiery sparkles"
753,CHAPTER III.,up the chimney.
754,CHAPTER III.,
755,CHAPTER III.,"“Make haste, man!” he said, impatiently. “Heap on the wood.”"
756,CHAPTER III.,
757,CHAPTER III.,"The obedient servant piled it from a box like a high, old-fashioned"
758,CHAPTER III.,"bedstead, which held at least a half cord of logs."
759,CHAPTER III.,
760,CHAPTER III.,“Quick! quick! What carelessness! This room is cold as death.”
761,CHAPTER III.,
762,CHAPTER III.,"The man went out soon as he could escape, and reported to the servants"
763,CHAPTER III.,"that the Baron was in one of his tiger fits. They wondered why, when he"
764,CHAPTER III.,"was so pleased over the wedding, and in their own hall they talked it"
765,CHAPTER III.,over with many wonderments.
766,CHAPTER III.,
767,CHAPTER III.,"But the lord of the castle had no dark mood, no tiger fit for Ginevra."
768,CHAPTER III.,
769,CHAPTER III.,"“Now, my darling,” said he, holding the light shape across his breast,"
770,CHAPTER III.,"while he wrapped the fur round her feet, “now I have my little girl all"
771,CHAPTER III.,mine own for the last time. What shall I sing?”
772,CHAPTER III.,
773,CHAPTER III.,"“About the Norse kings, father. How they used to steal their brides and"
774,CHAPTER III.,sail away over the foaming North seas to the lands of snow and ice.”
775,CHAPTER III.,
776,CHAPTER III.,The Baron was not much of a singer; but the deep roll of his voice
777,CHAPTER III.,"well suited the thunder of the storm without. A strange cradle-song,"
778,CHAPTER III.,"to be sure, of fighting, of hunting, of blood, and of victory. An hour"
779,CHAPTER III.,"passed. There was no rift in the clouds, no lull in the dismal wind."
780,CHAPTER III.,"Then the snow began to fall--the hushing snow, which seems to quiet"
781,CHAPTER III.,heaven and earth.
782,CHAPTER III.,
783,CHAPTER III.,"“It will be fair to-morrow,” said Ginevra, sleepily, rousing a little."
784,CHAPTER III.,“That was a brave song of the pirates. Now the wind goes down.” She
785,CHAPTER III.,"opened the clear blue eyes once more and smiled, showing the pearly"
786,CHAPTER III.,"little teeth. “Good-night. Do not let me tire you, father dear;” and"
787,CHAPTER III.,"so, murmuring love words her nurse had taught, she went to her innocent"
788,CHAPTER III.,"dreams--in all the kingdoms of sleep, the sweetest thing that breathed."
789,CHAPTER III.,
790,CHAPTER III.,It snowed and it snowed and it snowed. Toward morning the castle was a
791,CHAPTER III.,very castle of silence; and the noiseless world lay like a cold white

793,CHAPTER III.,
794,CHAPTER III.,"Ginevra, lapped in downy fur, nested like a bird in her father’s"
795,CHAPTER III.,"breast, and he watched the delicate, upturned face with a watch that"
796,CHAPTER III.,"knew no weariness, till gray dawn broke over the earth, and the"
797,CHAPTER III.,hilltops were tipped with silver.
798,CHAPTER III.,
799,CHAPTER III.,Many times he touched her feet to feel if they were warm. Many times
800,CHAPTER III.,he leaned his ear to her fragrant breath and softly wound a stray curl
801,CHAPTER III.,"of her hair, in rings of gold, round his forefinger. He hummed verses"
802,CHAPTER III.,"of old tunes some lost love sang in the years long gone, when he was"
803,CHAPTER III.,young; and once he whispered a prayer.
804,CHAPTER III.,
805,CHAPTER III.,"Fond, foolish old man! Why wore he the night away in such sad, sweet"

817,CHAPTER IV.,"clasps, every clasp set with an emerald stone; her vest of gold,"
818,CHAPTER IV.,"embroidered with flowers; her floating veil like silver mist, morning"
819,CHAPTER IV.,"blushes on her cheek, and pearls upon her breast. The heavy snow which"
820,CHAPTER IV.,had fallen in the night did not keep away the wedding guests. They came
821,CHAPTER IV.,early in spite of storm and cold. The priest was there; the joy-bells
822,CHAPTER IV.,"rang; the prayer was said, the blessings given; and never, day nor"
823,CHAPTER IV.,"night, would Lord Lovel part again from Ginevra."
824,CHAPTER IV.,
825,CHAPTER IV.,"As they sat at the feast, suddenly the bride was missed from the side"
826,CHAPTER IV.,"of her lord. He hastily left the table, and in a few minutes returned"
827,CHAPTER IV.,and whispered to the Baron.
828,CHAPTER IV.,
829,CHAPTER IV.,"“’Tis one of her childish plays, a trick only to make a trial of our"
830,CHAPTER IV.,"love,” said the Baron, trying to smile. “One more health to Lady Lovel!"
831,CHAPTER IV.,Fill high the glasses!”
832,CHAPTER IV.,
833,CHAPTER IV.,"He raised a goblet, but his hand shook; and when he tried to lift the"
834,CHAPTER IV.,"red wine, it poured down the table, like a stream of blood. And soon"
835,CHAPTER IV.,from guest to guest the panic spread.
836,CHAPTER IV.,
837,CHAPTER IV.,"“Good friends,” he cried, springing to his feet, “there’s not a"
838,CHAPTER IV.,"moment to spare. Lady Ginevra is missing--perhaps lost. Lovel, my"
839,CHAPTER IV.,"son, look for her in the main buildings, where I know she is. My Lord"
840,CHAPTER IV.,"of Cranston, with his vassals, will hunt through the south wing."
841,CHAPTER IV.,"Huntingdon and his followers will search the north wing. Do thou, Ban,"
842,CHAPTER IV.,"go through the vaults and cellars, leaving no stone unturned. Report to"
843,CHAPTER IV.,me here.”
844,CHAPTER IV.,
845,CHAPTER IV.,The veins in the Baron’s face swelled out like cords; great drops of
846,CHAPTER IV.,sweat gathered on his forehead; his lips were pale as ashes. And the
847,CHAPTER IV.,brave men around him turned white and trembled. They remembered the
848,CHAPTER IV.,prophecy--_the Lady Ginevra is doomed_.
849,CHAPTER IV.,
850,CHAPTER IV.,"With lighted torches, they scattered to their work. Along the galleries"
851,CHAPTER IV.,"Lovel shouted, “My life, my love, come to me! Come, or thou art lost!”"
852,CHAPTER IV.,"There was no flying footstep, no ringing laugh, no veil like silver"
853,CHAPTER IV.,"mist, only cold and dark, and the mocking echo, Lost, Lost! When he"
854,CHAPTER IV.,"passed the grand staircase, he felt drawn toward the wall. He thought"
855,CHAPTER IV.,there was a noise. They listened.
856,CHAPTER IV.,
857,CHAPTER IV.,"“Be still, Alfred; I am sure I hear a step,” said Lovel, eagerly"
858,CHAPTER IV.,"clasping his hands together, like one in prayer."
859,CHAPTER IV.,
860,CHAPTER IV.,"“No,” said Alfred; “it is a rat scratching behind the wainscot.”"
861,CHAPTER IV.,
862,CHAPTER IV.,They listened again. Surely something stirred. Hush! They held their
863,CHAPTER IV.,breath. A sound nearly like a sob; another; one more; then all was
864,CHAPTER IV.,still as the breast when the spirit has fled.
865,CHAPTER IV.,
866,CHAPTER IV.,"Lovel looked into the tall clock, where she could easily stand upright,"
867,CHAPTER IV.,"behind, under, above it, and found nothing but dust and cobweb. “My"
868,CHAPTER IV.,"lamb, my dove,” he cried, “come home, or thou art lost!” Lofty arch and"
869,CHAPTER IV.,"empty distance rang with the sound, but gave back no answer."
870,CHAPTER IV.,
871,CHAPTER IV.,"Meanwhile, the Baron strode up and down the hall, like a hungry lion in"
872,CHAPTER IV.,his cage. He looked so awful no one but little Geta dared go near him.
873,CHAPTER IV.,Every time the clock struck he would say:
874,CHAPTER IV.,
875,CHAPTER IV.,"“Geta, is thy Lady’s chamber warm?”"
876,CHAPTER IV.,
877,CHAPTER IV.,"“Warm, my lord.”"
878,CHAPTER IV.,
879,CHAPTER IV.,“And light?”
880,CHAPTER IV.,
881,CHAPTER IV.,"“Light, my lord.”"
882,CHAPTER IV.,
883,CHAPTER IV.,“Her slippers by the fire?”
884,CHAPTER IV.,
885,CHAPTER IV.,"“Yes, my lord. She would find the bath and all ready, were she here"
886,CHAPTER IV.,this very minute.”
887,CHAPTER IV.,
888,CHAPTER IV.,"“I would to God she were here, Geta!”"
889,CHAPTER IV.,
890,CHAPTER IV.,[Illustration]
891,CHAPTER IV.,
892,CHAPTER IV.,"Ah! bitter chill the night was! The owl, for all his feathers, was"
893,CHAPTER IV.,"a-cold. The wind raved and tore at the windows, and sleety snow whirled"
894,CHAPTER IV.,"and hissed and drifted against them, and under the loose old casements."
895,CHAPTER IV.,"The Baron groaned in anguish; in this wild storm, where was his tender"
896,CHAPTER IV.,child the winds of heaven had never visited too roughly? Where? Oh!
897,CHAPTER IV.,where?
898,CHAPTER IV.,
899,CHAPTER IV.,At daybreak the companies straggled back. Not a word was spoken. The
900,CHAPTER IV.,beloved was not found. They breakfasted on the cold meats of the
901,CHAPTER IV.,"wedding-feast, and every time a door opened, turned and looked as if to"
902,CHAPTER IV.,see her dancing home as she had danced away.
903,CHAPTER IV.,
904,CHAPTER IV.,"Without food or rest, Lord Lovel--oh, how changed!--hunted the highest,"
905,CHAPTER IV.,"the lowest, the loneliest spot, calling her by every dear name. “Come"
906,CHAPTER IV.,"to me! Come, or thou art lost!” And the wind, moaning through black"
907,CHAPTER IV.,"arch and freezing gallery, gave back the echo, Lost!"
908,CHAPTER IV.,
909,CHAPTER IV.,"Four days and nights were wasted thus. Then they met in the hall, and,"
910,CHAPTER IV.,"in a hoarse, changed voice, the Baron spoke:"
911,CHAPTER IV.,
912,CHAPTER IV.,"“Thanks, my friends, every one. Be it remembered, he who bringeth me"
913,CHAPTER IV.,"trace of the Lady Ginevra, or clew to her finding, shall have what he"
914,CHAPTER IV.,"may ask, were it half my barony.”"
915,CHAPTER IV.,
916,CHAPTER IV.,"Deep lines in his face showed how he had suffered, and his hair, that"
917,CHAPTER IV.,"yesterday was streaked with gray, was white as wool. The wedding"
918,CHAPTER IV.,"guests turned to go, and then the great bell in the tower struck one."
919,CHAPTER IV.,"There was silence deep as death. Hark! two, three, four; it rang to"
920,CHAPTER IV.,seventeen. What could it be?
921,CHAPTER IV.,
922,CHAPTER IV.,"No one inhabited the bell-tower, and, except under orders, the ropes"
923,CHAPTER IV.,"were never touched. That sound, so dread, so solemn, struck on every"
924,CHAPTER IV.,"ear, like a voice from heights beyond the living earth; the cry of some"
925,CHAPTER IV.,"desolate soul passing through cloudy spaces, the dim region between"
926,CHAPTER IV.,two worlds. Could it be fairy hands tolling the passing bell for the
927,CHAPTER IV.,soul of Ginevra? Was it a ring from heaven that her presence was lost
928,CHAPTER IV.,"from the abodes of the living, that she must now be numbered with the"
929,CHAPTER IV.,"dead? These questions have not been answered, and will not be answered"
930,CHAPTER IV.,till the great day comes which ends all question and brings each hidden
931,CHAPTER IV.,thing to light.
932,CHAPTER IV.,
933,CHAPTER IV.,Till this time the Baron had not shed a tear. When the last sad tone
934,CHAPTER IV.,"moaned and trembled through the air, he hid his face in his hands, and"
935,CHAPTER IV.,"big drops ran through his fingers, like fast rushing rain."
936,CHAPTER IV.,
937,CHAPTER IV.,Children clung to their mothers; women sobbed together in a crowd; and
938,CHAPTER IV.,"warlike men, too brave to be ashamed of tears, fell into each other’s"
939,CHAPTER IV.,arms and cried aloud.
940,CHAPTER IV.,
941,CHAPTER IV.,Never were wedding guests like those who that day passed the icy
942,CHAPTER IV.,"fountain and through the hushing snow of the leafless forest, where the"
943,CHAPTER IV.,"wind was wailing farewell forever, and forever farewell."
944,CHAPTER IV.,
945,CHAPTER IV.,"From the lonesome hemlocks, loaded with snow, Lovel went back alone"
946,CHAPTER IV.,"to Ginevra’s chamber. Garlanded with roses, it was light and warm;"
947,CHAPTER IV.,"the tiny slippers were before the fire; her lute, her birds, her"
948,CHAPTER IV.,"needlework, were there; but the Rose of the World was missing; missing"
949,CHAPTER IV.,"the little feet that nevermore would lightly run to meet him, nevermore"
950,CHAPTER IV.,would lightly follow.

981,CONCLUSION.,leaves have fallen and the singing birds have flown.
982,CONCLUSION.,
983,CONCLUSION.,"With haggard face and sunken eyes he hunted that wide and weary castle,"

992,CONCLUSION.,"Then he leaned on Lovel’s neck, and wept sorrowing, knowing they would"
993,CONCLUSION.,see each other on earth no more.
994,CONCLUSION.,
995,CONCLUSION.,"In front of battle, Lovel looked death in the face as if he loved it."
996,CONCLUSION.,"He fell on the bloody sands of Holy Land, and amid the dead and dying,"
997,CONCLUSION.,"they buried him where he lay, wrapped in his cloak, his good sword by"

999,CONCLUSION.,
1000,CONCLUSION.,"Geta and Alfred were married, and the voices of their children were"

1006,CONCLUSION.,
1007,CONCLUSION.,"Some said Ginevra was spirited away in the storm; some, that a robber"

1010,CONCLUSION.,"Where she went none ever knew, nor was she heard of more."
1011,CONCLUSION.,
1012,CONCLUSION.,"The Baron never rested from his search. All day the old man, wrinkled"
1013,CONCLUSION.,"and bent, groped his way through doleful chambers, and even into the"
1014,CONCLUSION.,"dreadful dungeon, hunting his darling child; and often, at dead of"
1015,CONCLUSION.,"night, his torch flamed through the windows of some far tower, or along"
1016,CONCLUSION.,the merlons of the dizzy battlements. One day he was found lying on the
1017,CONCLUSION.,"staircase, her little slippers, yellow and faded, held tightly in his"
1018,CONCLUSION.,"hand. The dull, deep pain was over; the aching feet at rest; his search"

1027,CONCLUSION.,from black and moldy walls; the drawbridge rotted in the green and
1028,CONCLUSION.,stagnant waters of the moat; the flagstaff fell and went to dust upon
1029,CONCLUSION.,the roof; and over all hung a cloud of fear and dread. So it was told
1030,CONCLUSION.,something ailed the place--that it was haunted. Nothing stirred the

1035,CONCLUSION.,"When a hundred years had passed, the castle was bought by strangers;"
