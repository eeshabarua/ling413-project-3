41,LITTLE ALLIE.,I have been to see my little cousin Alice. She is just three years
42,LITTLE ALLIE.,"old, and I love her dearly. She has many things to play with. She has"
43,LITTLE ALLIE.,"a ball, a rattle, and a horse; and she had a nice wax doll given her"
44,LITTLE ALLIE.,"last Christmas, but as she got the paint off its face by kissing, it"
45,LITTLE ALLIE.,"is laid by till she is bigger. We played she was my baby, and I"
46,LITTLE ALLIE.,"dressed her up and took her to walk; after that we played have tea,"
47,LITTLE ALLIE.,"and then I rocked her to sleep, and she looked so nice I could not"
48,LITTLE ALLIE.,help kissing her. She is coming to see me next week.

66,THE SHIP.,"What a long time to be on the water! He says, when he comes home he"

107,THE RIDE.,"This little girl is having a ride. She has a nice carriage, and a"

109,THE RIDE.,I had a ride in a goat carriage once; it was on Boston Common; father
110,THE RIDE.,"put little Arthur and me into the carriage, and we rode along, holding"
111,THE RIDE.,"the reins, as happy as could be. After the ride was over, we went to"
112,THE RIDE.,"the Public Garden and fed the ducks and fishes, and then we had a sail"
113,THE RIDE.,in the boat. I hope we shall go again next summer.

126,THE LION.,Let me tell you a short story about a Lion. Once a poor Negro found
127,THE LION.,"that a Lion was following him, as he was walking along through the"
128,THE LION.,woods. The Lion was watching for a chance to spring upon him. The man
129,THE LION.,"was very much frightened, but walked swiftly along till he came to a"
130,THE LION.,"very steep bank; here he quickly placed his hat and cloak on a bush,"
131,THE LION.,"to make it look like a man, and then he crept away. The Lion, thinking"
132,THE LION.,"it was the man, was silly enough to spring upon the cloak, and tumbled"
133,THE LION.,on the rocks below.

192,SUSY BROWN.,"Susy Brown is a good girl; she is willing to give up her play, and"
193,SUSY BROWN.,stay at home to take care of the baby. Some of her friends were going
194,SUSY BROWN.,"to the woods and fields to pick berries, and Susy wanted to go with"
195,SUSY BROWN.,"them; but when she came home from school, and found her mother tired"
196,SUSY BROWN.,"and worn with her work and the heat, Susy took the baby and said she"
197,SUSY BROWN.,would stay at home and let her mother rest. When the girls came home

211,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,
212,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,Henry had seen a squirrel in a cage; he had watched him whirling about
213,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,"and cracking his nuts, and he longed to have one of his own; so he"
214,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,"built a trap-cage, and set it near the great nut tree. He set it in"
215,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,"the morning, and then went to school, but he could not study much for"
216,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,thinking of the trap. After school it did not take him long to visit
217,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,"the old nut tree, and lo! there was a little squirrel in his trap; but"
218,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,"little squirry soon got away, as you see, and ran off to the woods,"
219,THE SQUIRREL-TRAP.,happy enough to get his liberty again.

232,THE SQUIRREL.,One pleasant summer morning
233,THE SQUIRREL.,A little boy was seen
234,THE SQUIRREL.,Beneath a spreading oak tree
235,THE SQUIRREL.,Upon a village green.
236,THE SQUIRREL.,
237,THE SQUIRREL.,And to a merry squirrel
238,THE SQUIRREL.,The child was heard to say--
239,THE SQUIRREL.,"""How is it, Mr. Muncher,"
240,THE SQUIRREL.,"You always are at play?"""
241,THE SQUIRREL.,
242,THE SQUIRREL.,"""I laid up nuts, last autumn,"
243,THE SQUIRREL.,"So I can frolic now,"""
244,THE SQUIRREL.,"Replied the merry squirrel,"
245,THE SQUIRREL.,And frisked along the bough.

247,THE SQUIRREL.,[Illustration]
248,THE SQUIRREL.,

253,THE SQUIRREL.,
254,THE SQUIRREL.,Near by a bird was stopping
255,THE SQUIRREL.,To rest its pretty wing--
256,THE SQUIRREL.,"""Pray, tell me,"" said the youngster,"

258,THE SQUIRREL.,
259,THE SQUIRREL.,"""I never had a master,"""
260,THE SQUIRREL.,The little bird replied;
261,THE SQUIRREL.,"""But when my mate was sitting,"
262,THE SQUIRREL.,To comfort her I tried;
263,THE SQUIRREL.,
264,THE SQUIRREL.,"""And if you like my singing,"
265,THE SQUIRREL.,Its secret I will tell--
266,THE SQUIRREL.,"All that we do for love, sir,"
267,THE SQUIRREL.,"We surely shall do well."""

303,THE SWING.,cool it makes you to swing in the shade! I love papa for fixing this
304,THE SWING.,"swing, don't you? We will kiss him when he comes home."""
305,THE SWING.,
306,THE SWING.,Amy loves to swing her little brother better than to swing herself;
307,THE SWING.,"but sometimes she swings, and holds little Eddie in her lap. What nice"

322,THE POOR BEGGAR.,"""Mother, I am so hungry,"" said Charley Gray, as he returned from"
323,THE POOR BEGGAR.,"school. ""Why!"" said his mother, ""did you not eat the dinner that you"
324,THE POOR BEGGAR.,"carried with you?"" ""No, dear mother; as I was going to school, I saw,"
325,THE POOR BEGGAR.,"sitting by the roadside, a poor old man and a little girl; they looked"
326,THE POOR BEGGAR.,so sad and tired that I stopped to speak to them; they said they were
327,THE POOR BEGGAR.,"very hungry--so I gave them my dinner, and went without myself. I am"

343,THE DIRTY BOY.,he will soon be old enough to earn some better clothes.
344,THE DIRTY BOY.,
345,THE DIRTY BOY.,"Some little boys who have good clothes, and kind parents to keep them"
346,THE DIRTY BOY.,"clean, hate to be washed. I have heard of a boy who had to be hired to"
347,THE DIRTY BOY.,"have his face washed, and he would often cry about it, as though it"
348,THE DIRTY BOY.,"was a dreadful thing. Children, to be loved, should be nice and"
