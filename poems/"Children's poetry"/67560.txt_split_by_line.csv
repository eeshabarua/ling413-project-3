212,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
213,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
214,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Perhaps one of the most vivid impressions which the tourist receives
215,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"upon his entrance into any Spanish city whatsoever, is of its muscular"
216,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"beggars--men of enormous size, with their ruffianly swaggering strength"
217,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"exaggerated by the national cloak. This garment is of heavy, tufted"
218,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"woollens, long and fringed, almost indestructable, and is frequently"
219,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"worn to muffle half the face; and the broad slouch hat, usually with a"
220,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"couple of rough feathers stuck in its band, does not tend to soften the"
221,ALL THE WORLD OVER,general brigandish effect.
222,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
223,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"These beggars are licensed by the government, which must reap a"
224,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"goodly revenue from the disgraceful crowd, as they are numerous, and"
225,ALL THE WORLD OVER,therefore they pursue their avocation in the most open manner. They
226,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"will frequently follow the traveller a half-mile, especially should"
227,ALL THE WORLD OVER,they find him to be ignorant of that magic formula of dismissal which
228,ALL THE WORLD OVER,is known to all Spaniards:
229,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
230,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"_Pardon, for God’s sake, Brother!_"
231,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
232,ALL THE WORLD OVER,This appeal is constantly on the lip of every Spanish lady. She utters
233,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"it swiftly, without so much as a glance, a dozen times of a morning on"
234,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"her way to church, as a dozen gaunt, dirty hands are thrust in her face"
235,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"as she passes; and hearing it, the most persistent fellow of them all"
236,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is at once silenced, and falls back."
237,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
238,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Coming in from their kennel-homes among the ruins and the holes in the
239,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"hills outside, it is the custom to make an early morning tour of the"
240,ALL THE WORLD OVER,city before they take up their stations for the day at the various
241,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"church and hotel doors. Each seems to be provided with “green pudding,”"
242,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"in his garlic pot, and he eats as he goes along, and prays as he eats,"
243,ALL THE WORLD OVER,stopping in front of the great oval patio or court gates of iron
244,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"lattice, which guard the mansions of the rich."
245,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
246,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"At these patio doors he makes a prodigious racket, shaking the iron"
247,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"rods furiously, and all the while muttering his prayers, until some one"
248,ALL THE WORLD OVER,of the family appears at a gallery window. Then instantly the mutter
249,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"becomes a whine, a pitiful tale is wailed forth, and alms are dolefully"
250,ALL THE WORLD OVER,implored “for the love of God.” But although such mottoes as “Poverty
251,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is no Crime” are very often painted on the walls of their fine houses,"
252,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the probability is that the unmoved Señorita will murmur a swift
253,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"“Pardon, for God’s sake, Brother!” and retire, to soon appear again to"
254,ALL THE WORLD OVER,silence another of the fraternity with the same potent formula.
255,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
256,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"However, each of the countless horde is sure to gather in centimes"
257,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"sufficient for the day’s cigarettes and garlic, and, in the long run,"
258,ALL THE WORLD OVER,to support life to a good old age.
259,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
260,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
261,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The Spaniards are a nation of dancers and singers. Every Spanish child
262,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"seems born with the steps, gestures, snappings and clappings of the"
263,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"national _fandango_ dance, at the ends of his fingers and toes. A"
264,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"guitar is the universal possession, and every owner is a fine player."
265,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The solitary horseman, the traveller by rail, takes along his guitar;"
266,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and in car, or at cross-roads, he is sure of dancers at the first"
267,ALL THE WORLD OVER,thrilling twang. There is always a merry youth and maiden aboard ready
268,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"to make acquaintance in a dance, and anywhere the whole household will"
269,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"troop from the cottage, the plowman will leave his team in the furrow,"
270,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and the laborer drop his hoe, for a half-hour’s joyous “footing o’t.”"
271,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
272,ALL THE WORLD OVER,One of the interesting sights of Toledo is the great city fountain on
273,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Street St. Isabel, near the cathedral. It is a good place to study"
274,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"donkeys and their drivers, and the lower classes of the populace. The"
275,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"water, deliciously sweet and cool, is brought from the mountains by the"
276,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"old Moorish-built water-ways, and flows by faucet. There is no public"
277,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"system of delivery, consequently a good business falls into the hands"
278,ALL THE WORLD OVER,of private water-carriers. These supply families at a franc a month.
279,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The poorer households go to and fro with their own water-jars as need
280,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"calls, carrying them on their heads. They often wear a cushioned ring,"
281,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"fitting the head, to render the carrying of the jar an easier matter."
282,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
283,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"A picturesque article of dress among Spanish men, is the national sash,"
284,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"a broad woollen some four yards in length, of gay colorings. This is"
285,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"wound three or four times around the waist, its fringed end tucked in"
286,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"to hang floating, and the inevitable broad knife thrust within its"
287,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"folds, which also hold the daily supply of tobacco. A common sight"
288,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is the sudden stop on the street, a lighting of a fresh cigarette, a"
289,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"loosening of the loosened sash, a twitch of the short breeches, and"
290,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"then a tight, snug wind-up, when the lounger moves on again."
291,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
292,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Another amusing sight is the picturesque beggar who seems at first
293,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"glance to be hanging in effigy against the cathedral walls, so"
294,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"motionless will some of these fellows stand, hat slouched over the"
295,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"face, the brass government “license” labelling the breast, a hand"
296,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"extended, and, in many cases, a crest worn prominently on the ragged"
297,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"garments, to show that the wearer is a proud descendant of some old"
298,ALL THE WORLD OVER,grandee family. To address this crested beggar by any other title than
299,ALL THE WORLD OVER,_Caballero_ (gentleman) is a deadly insult.
300,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
301,ALL THE WORLD OVER,[Illustration]
302,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
303,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
304,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Among the many small sights of the Plaza about Christmas time, are the"
305,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"sellers of zambombas, or Devil’s Fiddles. This toy, which the stranger"
306,ALL THE WORLD OVER,sometime takes for a receptacle of sweet drinks to be imbibed through
307,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"a hollow cane, is a favorite plaything with Spanish children. A skin"
308,ALL THE WORLD OVER,is stretched over a bottomless jar; into this is fastened a stout
309,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"length of sugar-cane, and lo! a zambomba. Its urchin-owner spits on his"
310,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"palms, rubs them smartly up and down the ridgy cane, when the skin-drum"
311,ALL THE WORLD OVER,reverberates delightfully.
312,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
313,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The fruit markets are of a primitive sort. The peasant fills
314,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"his donkey-panniers with grapes, garlic, melons straw-cased and"
315,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"straw-handled, whatever he has ripe, and starts for town. Reaching the"
316,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Plaza, in the shade of the cathedral, he spreads his cloak, rolling a"
317,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"rim. On this huge woollen plate he arranges his fruit, weighing it out"
318,ALL THE WORLD OVER,as customers demand.
319,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
320,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"From the old Moorish casements, the traveller looks down on the most"
321,ALL THE WORLD OVER,rudimentary sort of life. He sees no labor-saving machinery. Instead
322,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of huge vans loaded with compact hay bales, he beholds the donkey"
323,ALL THE WORLD OVER,hay-train. The farmer binds a mountain of loose hay on each of his
324,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"donkeys, lashes them together, and with a neighbor to help beat the"
325,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"train along, starts for market. These trains may be seen any day"
326,ALL THE WORLD OVER,crooking about among the steep mountain-ways.
327,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
328,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The student of folk-life notes the shoemakers on the Plaza at work in
329,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the open air. Formerly the sandal was universally worn, with its sole"
330,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of knotted hemp, and its canvas brought up over the toe, at which point"
331,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"was fastened a pair of ribbons about four feet long, and these ribbons"
332,ALL THE WORLD OVER,each province had its own fashion of lacing and tying. But now the
333,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"conventional footgear of Paris is common, and one buys boots of the"
334,ALL THE WORLD OVER,fine glossy Cordovan leather for a trifle.
335,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
336,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The proprietors of the neighboring vineyards visit the wine shops
337,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"weekly to bring full wine-skins, and take such as are emptied. These"
338,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"skins, often with their wool unsheared, are cured by remaining several"
339,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"weeks filled with wine-oil, and all seams are coated with pitch to"
340,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"prevent leakage. The wholesale skins hold about eight gallons, being"
341,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"usually those of well-grown animals. They are stoutly sewn, tied at"
342,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"each knee, and also at the neck, whence the wine is decanted into"
343,ALL THE WORLD OVER,smaller skins by means of a tunnel.
344,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
345,ALL THE WORLD OVER,[Illustration]
346,ALL THE WORLD OVER,

348,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The beggars of Spain are a most devout class. Piety is, with them, the"
349,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"form under which they conduct business; a shield, and a certificate of"
350,ALL THE WORLD OVER,character. They walk the streets under the protection of the patron
351,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"saint of the principal church in town, and they formally demand alms of"
352,ALL THE WORLD OVER,you in the name of that saint. It is Religion that solicits you--the
353,ALL THE WORLD OVER,beggar’s own personality is not at all involved; and it is thus that
354,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the proud Spanish self-respect is saved from hurt.
355,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
356,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The tourist who has not tarried in French towns, is, at first,"
357,ALL THE WORLD OVER,astonished to behold women passing to and fro upon the streets with no
358,ALL THE WORLD OVER,head covering whatever. Hats and bonnets are rarely seen upon Spanish
359,ALL THE WORLD OVER,women of the lower and middle classes. Those who are street-venders
360,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"sit bareheaded all day long in their chairs on the Plaza, wholly"
361,ALL THE WORLD OVER,indifferent to the great heat and blinding dazzle of the Spanish sun.
362,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"About Christmas, dozens of a “stands” spring up along the Plaza. It is"
363,ALL THE WORLD OVER,at that season that the gypsy girls come in with their roasters and
364,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"their bags of big foreign chestnuts; and they do a thriving business,"
365,ALL THE WORLD OVER,for every good Spanish child expects roast chestnuts and salt at
366,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Christmas.
367,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
368,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Many of the mountain families about Toledo keep small flocks of
369,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"sheep--flocks that, instead of dotting a green landscape with peaceful"
370,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"white, as in America and Northern Europe, only darken the reddish-brown"
371,ALL THE WORLD OVER,soil of Spain with a restless shading of a redder and a deeper hue.
372,ALL THE WORLD OVER,These brown sheep are herded daily down on the fenceless wastes. The
373,ALL THE WORLD OVER,shepherd-boys are usually attended by shepherd-dogs so enormous in size
374,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"that the traveller often mistakes them for donkeys. They are sagacious,"
375,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and do most of the herding, their masters devoting themselves to the"
376,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"guitar, the siesta, the cigarette, and the garlic pudding."
377,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
378,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Toledo, more than any other Spanish city, abounds with interesting bits"
379,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and noble examples of the old Moorish architecture, for the reason"
380,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"that it has not been rebuilt at all, and that few of its ruins have"
381,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"been restored, or even retouched. Color alone has changed. The city"
382,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"now is of the soft hue of a withered pomegranate. Turn where you will,"
383,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"your eye is delighted by an ornate façade, a carved gateway with its"
384,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"small reticent entrance door, a window with balcony and cross-bars, and"
385,ALL THE WORLD OVER,everywhere there is the horseshoe arch with its beautiful curve. The
386,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"old Alcazar is standing, though occupied as a Spanish arsenal, and on"
387,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the height opposite is the ruin of a fine Moorish castle.
388,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
389,ALL THE WORLD OVER,[Illustration]
390,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
391,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
392,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"One of the best “small businesses” in a Spanish city, is that of the"
393,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"domestic water-supply. Those dealers who have no donkeys, convey it"
394,ALL THE WORLD OVER,to their customers in long wheelbarrows constructed with a frame to
395,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"receive and hold several jars securely. Stone jars, with wood stopples"
396,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"attached with a cord, are used, the carrying-jars, being emptied"
397,ALL THE WORLD OVER,into larger jars in the water-cellars. The peasants have a poetic
398,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"appellation for the soft, constant drip of the water from the old"
399,ALL THE WORLD OVER,aqueducts: _The sigh of the Moor_.
400,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
401,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"With the Spaniard, as with the American, the turkey is a special"
402,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Christmas luxury. But the tempting rows of dressed fowls common to our
403,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"markets and groceries, are never to be seen. As the holiday season"
404,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"draws very close at hand, the mountain men come down into the city,"
405,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"driving before them their cackling, gobbling, lustrous-feathered"
406,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"flocks, bestowing upon them, of course, the usual daily allowance of"
407,ALL THE WORLD OVER,blows which is meted out to the patient family donkey. These poultry
408,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"dealers congregate upon the Plaza, where they smoke, and chaff, and"
409,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"dicker, keeping their droves in place with the whip; and the buyer"
410,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"shares in the capture of his flying, screaming, flapping purchase, in"
411,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"company with all the children on the street, for the turkey market is"
412,ALL THE WORLD OVER,usually great fun for the Spanish youngster.
413,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
414,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"In the cold season, one of the morning sights of a Spanish town is the"
415,ALL THE WORLD OVER,preparation of the big charcoal braziers outside the gates of the fine
416,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"dwelling-houses. The coals are laid and lighted, and then the servant"
417,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"blows them with a large grass fan until the ashes are white, when he"
418,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"may consider that all deadly fumes are dissipated, and that it is safe"
419,ALL THE WORLD OVER,to carry it within to the room it is to warm.
420,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
421,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Nearly all the peasants in the near vicinity of cities are market
422,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"gardeners on a small scale. They cultivate small plots, and whenever"
423,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"any crop is ripe, they load their donkey-panniers and go into the"
424,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cities, where they sell from house to house. These vegetable-panniers"
425,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"have enormous pockets, and are woven of coarse, dyed grasses, in"
426,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"stripes and patterns of gaudy blue and red. When filled, they often"
427,ALL THE WORLD OVER,cover and broaden the donkey’s back to such an extent that the lazy
428,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"owner, determined to ride, must sit on the very last section of"
429,ALL THE WORLD OVER,backbone. Some of the streets in Toledo are so narrow that the brick
430,ALL THE WORLD OVER,or stone walls of the buildings have been hewn and hollowed out at
431,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"donkey-height, to allow the loaded panniers to pass. The buyers make"
432,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"their bargains from the windows, a sample vegetable being handed up for"
433,ALL THE WORLD OVER,inspection.

438,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Travellers should deny themselves Spain during December, January and"
439,ALL THE WORLD OVER,February. The heating apparatus of the American and the English house
440,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is unknown in Spanish dwellings--fireplace, stove, nor furnace. The"
441,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"peasant draws his cloak up to his nose and shivers and cowers, while"
442,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the middle-class family lights a single brazier, and the household,"
443,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"gathering in one room, hovers over the charcoal smouldering away in"
444,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"its brass cage, and the cats sit and purr on the broad wooden rim."
445,ALL THE WORLD OVER,These braziers are expensive--constructed of brass and copper--and
446,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"few families afford more than one, making winter comfort out of the"
447,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"question, as the floors, of marble or stone, never get well warmed."
448,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
449,ALL THE WORLD OVER,With the coming of pleasant weather Spanish families usually forsake
450,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the blinded, draperied, balconied rooms of the gallery for the secluded"
451,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and garden-like patio. This court is often fifty feet square, and"
452,ALL THE WORLD OVER,in its enclosure there is generally a fountain; the floor is tiled
453,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"with marble, there are stately tropic plants in tubs, and orange and"
454,ALL THE WORLD OVER,palm-trees are growing. Should the sunshine become too fierce there
455,ALL THE WORLD OVER,are smoothly-running screens and awnings to roof the whole court in an
456,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"instant. Some of the old Moorish patios contain quaint wells, dry at"
457,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"some seasons, but often affording water sufficient for housekeeping"
458,ALL THE WORLD OVER,needs.
459,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
460,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The water-jars come from the famous potteries of Seville, and, made of"
461,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"a rude red clay, are similar in hue to our plant pots. They are brought"
462,ALL THE WORLD OVER,in high loads by oxen--and these pottery carts are often an enlivening
463,ALL THE WORLD OVER,feature of the dull country roads.
464,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
465,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The water cellar is not a cellar at all, but a stone-paved room off"
466,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the patio, delightfully cool and sloppy of a fiery July day, with the"
467,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"water-carriers unloading, and filling the array of dripping red jars"
468,ALL THE WORLD OVER,with the day’s supply from the public fountain.
469,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
470,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Every Spanish peasant wears a knife in his sash. These knives are
471,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"usually about eighteen inches long, with a broad, sharp, murderous"
472,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"blade. The handles are of tortoise or ivory, often carved richly,"
473,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"or inlaid with figures of the Virgin, the Saviour, or the crucifix."
474,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The knife is kept open by a curious little wheel, between blade and"
475,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"handle, and is used indiscriminately, to slice a melon or lay bare a"
476,ALL THE WORLD OVER,quarrelsome neighbor’s heart.
477,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
478,ALL THE WORLD OVER,[Illustration]
479,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
480,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
481,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Seville is celebrated for its oranges and its pottery. Nearly the
482,ALL THE WORLD OVER,whole Spanish supply of water-jars comes from this city; and the
483,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"outlying country is agreeably dotted with orange orchards, as olive"
484,ALL THE WORLD OVER,oases enliven the vicinity of Cordova. The export of the fruit is a
485,ALL THE WORLD OVER,considerable business. The most delicious orange in the world may be
486,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"bought in the streets of Seville for a cent, and the ordinary rate for"
487,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the ordinary fruit is four for a cent. In the Christmas season large
488,ALL THE WORLD OVER,and selected oranges are sold in the outdoor booths. They are carefully
489,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"brought, and temptingly hung in nets, along with melons cased in straw,"
490,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"fine bunches of garlic, chestnuts, assorted lengths of sugar-cane,"
491,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"tambourines, zambombas, and such other sweet and noisy objects as"
492,ALL THE WORLD OVER,delight the Spanish youngster.
493,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
494,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The decorative plant of Spain is the aloe--truly decorative, with its"
495,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"base of long, dark, clear-cut, sword-like leaves, its tall slender"
496,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"trunk often rising twenty feet high, and its broad candelabras of"
497,ALL THE WORLD OVER,crimson blooms.
498,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
499,ALL THE WORLD OVER,A picturesque industry of Seville is the spinning of the green rope so
500,ALL THE WORLD OVER,much used by Spanish farmers. It is manufactured from the coarse pampas
501,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"grass of the plains, and the operation is a very leisurely and social"
502,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"one, requiring three persons: one to feed the wheel, one to turn it,"
503,ALL THE WORLD OVER,and a third to receive the twisted rope.
504,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
505,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Plowing, in Spain, is still a very rude performance. The primitive plow"
506,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of the Garden of Eden era is yet in use--a sharp crotch of a tree,"
507,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"crudely shod, however, with iron."
508,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
509,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"An indispensable article of peasants’ costume for both men and women,"
510,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"should an absence of even two hours be contemplated, is the _alforja_,"
511,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"or peasant’s bag. This, in idea, is similar to the donkey-pannier--a"
512,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"long, stout, woollen strip thickly tufted with bunches of red and blue"
513,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"wool, with a bag at either end, and is worn slung over the shoulder."
514,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The pockets of the _alforja_ invariably contain, one a pot of garlic,"
515,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"or green pudding, the other a wine skin."
516,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
517,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The mouths of some wine-skins are fitted with a bottomless wooden
518,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"saucer, and are lifted to the lips for drinking; but the preferable and"
519,ALL THE WORLD OVER,national style is to catch the stream with the skin held aloft and away
520,ALL THE WORLD OVER,at arm’s-length.

522,ALL THE WORLD OVER,[Illustration]
523,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
524,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
525,ALL THE WORLD OVER,A central point of interest for visitors to Seville is the Cathedral.
526,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Its tower, known as the Giralda, is one of the most celebrated"
527,ALL THE WORLD OVER,examples of sacred Moorish architecture. It was erected in an early
528,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"century, and was considered very ancient when the Spaniards, in the"
529,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, built upon it the fine Cathedral. In"
530,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the interior, the Tribuna de la Puorta Mayor is much visited for its"
531,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"lofty and beautiful sunlight effects, and there are several precious"
532,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Murillos. The ascent of the Giralda is usually made by tourists--an
533,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"agreeable variety in European climbing, as there are no stairs, the"
534,ALL THE WORLD OVER,whole progress being by an easy series of inclined planes of brick
535,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"masonry. Queen Isabella, not long ago, made the entire ascent and"
536,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"return upon horseback. From the summit, one views the whole of Seville,"
537,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"with its dark-green rim of orange gardens, set in the great flat"
538,ALL THE WORLD OVER,barrens that stretch out towards Cadiz. A comic sight usual at the foot
539,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of the tower, significant as a sign of the complete contempt in which"
540,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the Catholic Spaniard holds all things Moslem and Moorish, is that of"
541,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"a goat belonging to one of the custodians, tethered from morning till"
542,ALL THE WORLD OVER,night to a fine old Muezzin bell.
543,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
544,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Another noted building is the Tower of Gold, on the banks of the"
545,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Guadalquiver, opposite the Gypsy quarter. Tourists visit it to get the"
546,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"fine architectural effect of the Cathedral, also for its view of the"
547,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Bull Ring. It stands on the site of the old Inquisition, where hosts of"
548,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Moorish captives were tortured.
549,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
550,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The Alcazar, always visited, is an ancient Moorish palace, and is"
551,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"considered, in point of elegance, second to only the Alhambra. It is"
552,ALL THE WORLD OVER,now set aside by the government as the residence of the Queen-mother
553,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Isabella.
554,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
555,ALL THE WORLD OVER,San Telmo is also much visited. It is the palace of the Duc de
556,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Montpensier, known throughout Spain as “the orange man.” He owns"
557,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"numerous orange orchards, and lavishes much time and money on his"
558,ALL THE WORLD OVER,plantations and hothouses.
559,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
560,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Another point of curiosity is known as the House of Pilate. It is
561,ALL THE WORLD OVER,said to be an exact reproduction of the celebrated House of Pilate in
562,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Jerusalem. It is remarkable for some exquisite tiles, and it bears many"
563,ALL THE WORLD OVER,interesting inscriptions.
564,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
565,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Seville presents an odd aspect to the stranger between the hours of
566,ALL THE WORLD OVER,three and six P. M. During this hot interval the streets and shops are
567,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"deserted, everybody, even to the beggars, being under cover and asleep."

571,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
572,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Most of the peasant girls in the vicinity of Spanish cities contrive
573,ALL THE WORLD OVER,to keep a bit of flower-garden for their own personal purposes.
574,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"She is a thriftless lass indeed, who has not at least one fragrant"
575,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"double red rose in tending, or some other red-flowered shrub. From"
576,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Christmas on through the spring fête-days of the Church, they reap"
577,ALL THE WORLD OVER,their tiny harvests. During this season every Spanish man and woman
578,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"who can, wears a red flower in button-hole or over the ear, and the"
579,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"streets are thronged with bareheaded, black-tressed peasant and gypsy"
580,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"flower-venders. Flowers are a part of the daily marketing, and two or"
581,ALL THE WORLD OVER,three centimos--a centimo is one fifth of a cent--suffice to buy a
582,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"fresh nosegay. New Year’s is a marked fête in Seville, as then “The Old"
583,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Queen” in the Alcazar rides out in state, the Alameda is thronged with"
584,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"carriages, and the whole populace is a-blossom with red."
585,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
586,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"A custom noticed by the tourist who lingers about cathedral doors,"
587,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is one most observed, perhaps, by the poorer and more superstitious"
588,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"classes. Men and women dip the fingers, on entrance and departure, in"
589,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"holy water, and wet some one of the countless crosses which are set in"
590,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the wall just above the cash-boxes--the cash-box in Spain being the
591,ALL THE WORLD OVER,inevitable accompaniment of the cross.
592,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
593,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"As in other Spanish cities, the noble Profession of Beggary considers"
594,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"itself under the protection of the Church, and the entrance to the"
595,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cathedral is down a long vista of outstretched hands, the fortunate one"
596,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"at the far end, who holds aside the matting portiere for you to enter,"
597,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"feeling sure of a fee, however the others fare. The whole vicinity"
598,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"abounds with loathsome spectacles of disease and distress, those"
599,ALL THE WORLD OVER,entirely helpless managing to be conveyed daily into holy precincts.
600,ALL THE WORLD OVER,It is often amusing to witness an adult beggar “giving points” to some
601,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"young amateur in the art, the dignity of the national calling evidently"
602,ALL THE WORLD OVER,being insisted upon.
603,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
604,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"An agreeable sight in this city of churches and beggars, is the"
605,ALL THE WORLD OVER,afternoon stroll of companies of young priests and students from the
606,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"convents. They are very noticeable, as part of the panorama, with"
607,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"their broad, silky shovel hats and black flowing gowns. Some are"
608,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"scholastic and intent upon their studies even in the streets, while"
609,ALL THE WORLD OVER,others evidently take a most young man-of-the-world enjoyment in their
610,ALL THE WORLD OVER,cigarettes and the street-sights.

613,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
614,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
615,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Revenues are collected in most primitive ways by the Spanish City
616,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Fathers. As there are no important sources of public income, there are"
617,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"few transactions, however trifling, that do not pay tax and toll. Every"
618,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"man is suspected of smuggling and “false returns,” and it is a small"
619,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"bunch of garlic that escapes. Burly officials, often in shirt-sleeves"
620,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and with club, lounge at all the entrances to the town, to levy duty"
621,ALL THE WORLD OVER,upon any chance donkey-pannier or cart bringing in fruit and vegetables
622,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"for sale. Frequently there are scenes of confusion, sometimes of"
623,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"violence. The government is determined that not a turnip, not a carrot,"
624,ALL THE WORLD OVER,not a cabbage shall escape the yield of its due; and it is not to be
625,ALL THE WORLD OVER,denied that the poor farmer hopes fervently to smuggle in a wine-skin
626,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"or two--a dozen of eggs, or some other article of price, among his"
627,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cheaper commodities. As a rule, he fails; for, suspicious of over-much"
628,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"gesticulation and protestation, the official is quite likely to tumble"
629,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"out sacks, baskets, bundles and bales, and empty every one upon the"
630,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"ground, leaving the angry farmer to pick up and load again at his"
631,ALL THE WORLD OVER,leisure.
632,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
633,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Andalusia is a brown region stretching gravely between Cadiz and
634,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Granada. The effect of this landscape, all in low tones, upon natives"
635,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of the green lands of America and England, is most depressing. The soil"
636,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"itself is red, and the grass grows so sparsely that the color of the"
637,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"ground crops up, giving impression of general sun-blight, broken here"
638,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"and there by the glimmering moonlight gray of an olive orchard, or"
639,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the dark-green of an orange garden. The huts of the farmers are built
640,ALL THE WORLD OVER,of the red clay; the clothing of the population appears to be of the
641,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"undyed wool of the brown sheep, while to add to the prevailing russet"
642,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"hue, the general occupation seems to be that of herding pigs on the"
643,ALL THE WORLD OVER,plains--and the pigs are hideously brown also. It is said that they
644,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"derive their color from feeding on the great brown bug, or beetle,"
645,ALL THE WORLD OVER,which abounds in the soil. The traveller counts these feeding droves by
646,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the dozen, each with two lazy, smoking swineherds."
647,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
648,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Travelling by rail over the Andalusian levels, one passes a succession"
649,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of petty stations, villages of half a dozen houses each, where the only"
650,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"visible business appears to be in the hands of women, in the shape of"
651,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"one or two open-air tables, with pitchers and glasses, and a cow or"

658,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Many of the public buildings of Spanish cities stand as they were
659,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"captured from the Moors. Sometimes, as in Cadiz, the town has received"
660,ALL THE WORLD OVER,a coat of whitewash; but more frequently the only Spanish additions and
661,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"improvements are a few crosses inlaid in the old cement, or a plaster"
662,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Virgin niched, in rude contrast, beside some richly wrought Moorish"
663,ALL THE WORLD OVER,door of horseshoe form. The town hall of Seville remains to-day as ten
664,ALL THE WORLD OVER,centuries ago.
665,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
666,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The Spanish towns lie, for the most part, in the valley. The Moors"
667,ALL THE WORLD OVER,usually chose the site for their cities with a view to the natural
668,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"defences of mountain and river. The hills of course, remain, but the"
669,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"rivers, once full rushing tides, are now dried into stagnant shallow"
670,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"waters, a natural result in a country long uncultivated."

672,ALL THE WORLD OVER,A favorite business with the young men among the mountain peasants is
673,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the breeding of poultry; not alone of fat pullets for the Christmas
674,ALL THE WORLD OVER,markets--that is a minor interest so far as enjoyment goes--but of
675,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"choice young game cocks--cock-fighting being the staple, everyday"
676,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"national amusement, while the bullfight is to be regarded as fête and"
677,ALL THE WORLD OVER,festival--“the taste of blood” is a welcome ingredient in any Spanish
678,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"pleasure. All poultry is taken to market alive; the pullets, hanging"
679,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"head downwards, are slung in a bunch at the saddle bow, and the cocks"
680,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"are carried carefully in cages. Fowls are not a common article of food,"
681,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"as in France, but are, instead, a holiday luxury, and the costliest"
682,ALL THE WORLD OVER,meat in the market.
683,ALL THE WORLD OVER,
684,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"Looking idly abroad as he crosses the Andalusian plains, the tourist"
685,ALL THE WORLD OVER,on donkey-back notices the queer carts that take passengers from

701,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"should he meet a guitar, he comes at nightfall; and as it is certain"
702,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"that every second Spaniard, walking or riding, will have his guitar"
703,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"along, it is best not to look for the return of any messenger before"
704,ALL THE WORLD OVER,evening. He may have chosen to alight from his donkey and dance an
705,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"hour, or he may have elected to sit still and clap and snap a dance in"
706,ALL THE WORLD OVER,pantomime--either is exciting and deeply satisfactory--and a fulfilment
707,ALL THE WORLD OVER,of one of the obligations of daily life which no true Spaniard can
708,ALL THE WORLD OVER,be expected to neglect for any such simple considerations as promise
709,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"given, command laid, or bargain made."

711,ALL THE WORLD OVER,A peculiarly gloomy look is lent to the Spanish landscape by the
712,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cypress, sometimes growing in groups, sometimes towering singly in"
713,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"solitude. This tree, funereal in its best aspect, has a dead, dry,"
714,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"white trunk, and the branches begin at a height of twenty, thirty, or"
715,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"forty feet, and then drape themselves in a cone-like monumental mass"
716,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of purplish green. These gloomy evergreens are common, and the tourist"
717,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"feels, even if he does not note, the absence of the lively sunny"

723,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"As a rule, poor Burro is overloaded. A whole family will frequently"
724,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"come down into the city on his back, and tired though he be with"
725,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"plodding and stumbling and holding back, the officer at the gate is"
726,ALL THE WORLD OVER,sure to give him a blow and a bruise with his bludgeon of authority as
727,ALL THE WORLD OVER,he passes in; and the poor creature sometimes very justly lies down
728,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"in the street and dies without warning, allowing his owners to climb"
729,ALL THE WORLD OVER,homeward on foot.

731,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Now and then one comes unexpectedly on an example of ancient enterprise

734,ALL THE WORLD OVER,in motion--a pair of wheels studded with great cups operated by means
735,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"of a pair of poles, and a pair of donkeys, and a pair of drivers. The"

742,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Greatly dreaded by the unmarried young Spanish woman is the Beggars’
743,ALL THE WORLD OVER,Curse; and a goodly portion of the beggars’ revenue is ensured by
744,ALL THE WORLD OVER,this superstitious national fear. The more vicious of the fraternity
745,ALL THE WORLD OVER,keep good watch upon the wealthy young señoritas and their cavaliers
746,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"when they go out for pleasure. They do not follow them, perhaps;"
747,ALL THE WORLD OVER,instead they take up their stations around the doors of those
748,ALL THE WORLD OVER,restaurants--whence they never are driven--where ladies and their
749,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"escorts are wont to stop for chocolate, or coffee, or _aguardente_,"
750,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"on their return from calls or the theatre, or the Bull Ring. As the"
751,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"pair are departing, the burly beggar approaches, half barring the"
752,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"way perhaps, and asks for alms. It is usually bestowed; but he begs"
753,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"insolently for more; and if it be not forthcoming, a bony and rosaried"
754,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"arm is raised, “the evil eye” is fastened upon the doomed ones, and"
755,ALL THE WORLD OVER,the Beggars’ Curse--the Curse of the Unfortunate--which all Spaniards
756,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"dread, is threatened; and if it be evening, it is quite probable that"
757,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"the group stand near some crucifix of the suffering Saviour, with the"
758,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"red light of the street lantern shining down upon its ghastliness, so"
759,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"that the feeling of pious dread is greatly heightened, and a frightened"
760,ALL THE WORLD OVER,pressure on the cavalier’s arm carries the doubled alms into the
761,ALL THE WORLD OVER,outstretched hand.

763,ALL THE WORLD OVER,The dress of Spanish people of fashion is singularly artistic and
764,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"pleasing. Although Paris styles are now followed by the señoritas, they"
765,ALL THE WORLD OVER,still cling to the national black satin with its lustrous foldings and
766,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"flouncings, to the effective ball fringes, and to the mantilla, draping"
767,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"face and shoulder with its heavy black or white laces, the national red"
768,ALL THE WORLD OVER,rose set just above the ear. Nor is this too remarkable under the high
769,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"broad lights of the Spanish sky, though it might seen theatrical in our"
770,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cold, harsh, Northern atmosphere. The dress of the Spanish gentlemen"
771,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is as picturesque. The hat is usually a curious, double-brimmed silky"
772,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"beaver, while the cloak is most artistic in color and in drapery. This"
773,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"cloak, lasting a life-time, is of fine broadcloth, lined with heavy"
774,ALL THE WORLD OVER,blue or crimson velvet; and it is so disposed that the folding brings
775,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"this gorgeous lining in a round collar about the neck, while another"
776,ALL THE WORLD OVER,broad fold is turned over upon the whole long left side of the garment.
777,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"The peasant’s cloak, of the same cut, is lined with red flannel, but it"
778,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"is often worn as gracefully. Long trousers are becoming general, but"
779,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"in some districts the tight pantaloon, slashed at the knee, is still"
780,ALL THE WORLD OVER,"seen, with its gay garter embroidered with some fanciful motto. One"
781,ALL THE WORLD OVER,just brought from Spain bears this legend: _There is a girl in this

1266,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Germany, and although she has been dead over sixty years her one"
1267,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,hundredth birthday was celebrated elaborately throughout her son’s
1268,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"dominions, with almost as many rejoicings as we made here over the one"
1269,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,hundredth birthday of these United States.

1272,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1273,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"When a child Louisa was very beautiful, and as she grew up did not"
1274,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,disappoint the promise of those early days.
1275,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1276,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"She was married to Frederick William, Crown Prince of Prussia, when"
1277,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"only seventeen years of age, and brought down upon herself a sharp"
1278,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,rebuke from the proud mistress of ceremonies for the love she showed
1279,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"to a little child as she was making her public entry into Berlin,"
1280,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,preparatory to the solmnization of her marriage. It happened thus:
1281,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1282,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,The streets were thronged with people who had come to catch a glimpse
1283,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"of the fair young bride, while every now and then select persons would"
1284,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"step forward and present complimentary poems of welcome, or some"
1285,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,pretty gift. A sweet little girl advanced to give the queen a bunch of
1286,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"flowers, and Louisa was so struck with the child’s loveliness that she"
1287,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,stooped down and kissed her on the forehead. “Mein Gott!” exclaimed the
1288,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,horrified mistress of ceremonies. “What has your majesty done?” Louisa
1289,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"was as artless and simple as a child herself. “What?” said she, “is"
1290,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,that wrong? Must I never do so again?”
1291,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1292,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"But the prince, her husband, was no fonder of show and ceremony than"
1293,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"herself, and asserted manfully the right of his wife and himself to act"
1294,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"like other affectionate people, in spite of being king and queen."
1295,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1296,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"This royal pair had eight children, and upon these children was"
1297,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,lavished every care and attention. It is said that every night the king
1298,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,and queen went together to visit their sleeping children after they had
1299,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"been put into their little beds, and many a time were they surprised"
1300,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,by a bright pair of wide-awake eyes smiling back upon them a look of
1301,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"love in return. Queen Louisa used to say, “The children’s world is my"
1302,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"world,” nor were the little creatures slow to reciprocate the love she"
1303,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,gave.
1304,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1305,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"You know Christmas is observed in Germany with peculiar reverence,"
1306,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"and is a season set apart for mirthful recreation among all classes,"
1307,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,but more especially for the enjoyment of children. Berlin is gay with
1308,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Christmas trees and a brilliant array of toys etc., for at least a week"
1309,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,beforehand.
1310,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1311,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,Like other parents the king and queen found delight in preparing
1312,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,pleasant surprises for their little ones. While engaged in choosing
1313,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"presents for them, on one occasion they entered a top-shop where"
1314,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"a citizen’s wife was busy making purchases, but recognizing the"
1315,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,new-comers she bowed respectfully and retired. The queen addressed
1316,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"her in her peculiarly winning way and sweet voice. “Stop, dear lady,"
1317,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,what will the stall-keeper say if we drive away his customers?” She
1318,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"then inquired if the lady had come to buy toys for her children, and"
1319,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,asked how many little ones she had. Hearing there was a son about the
1320,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"age of the Crown Prince, the queen bought some toys and gave them to"
1321,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"the mother, saying, “Take them, dear lady, and give them to your crown"
1322,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,prince in the name of mine.”
1323,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1324,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"But I must tell you a yet prettier story, showing the queen’s fondness"
1325,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,for making children happy.
1326,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1327,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"There lived in Berlin a father and mother, who from some cause were so"
1328,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"poor, and low-spirited besides, that when the holiday came which all"
1329,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"children love best, they quietly resigned themselves to having nothing"
1330,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,to give their little ones. What can be more sad than a house which
1331,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,no Kriss Kringle visits? Just think of it! They told their children
1332,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,that there was to be no Christmas tree for them this year. The little
1333,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,boy and his sister had been led to believe that the _Christ-kind_ or
1334,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,Christ-child provides the tree and the gifts which are placed on tables
1335,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"round it; only ornaments, sweets and tapers are hung upon the branches."
1336,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Under this disappointment the children, in the innocent simplicity of"
1337,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"their faith, sought the aid of the good _Christ-kind_ in their own way."
1338,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1339,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Christmas Eve came, and the poor troubled parents looked on with wonder"
1340,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"as they beheld their children hopping and skipping about with joy,"
1341,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,although they were to be the only children for whom no Christmas tree
1342,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"would be lighted, nor pretty gifts provided. Still in high spirits they"
1343,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"watched at the window, and clapped their hands when the door-bell rang,"
1344,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,exclaiming: “Here it comes!” The door was opened and a man-servant
1345,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"appeared, laden with a gay tree and several packets, each addressed to"
1346,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,some member of the family.
1347,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1348,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,“There must be some mistake!” said the mother.
1349,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1350,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"“No, no!” cried the boy, “it is all right. I wrote to the good"
1351,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"_Christ-kind_, and told him what we wanted, and that you could not buy"
1352,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,anything this year.”
1353,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1354,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,The parents enjoyed the evening with their children and afterwards
1355,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"unravelled the mystery. The postmaster, astonished by a letter"
1356,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,evidently written by a very young scribe and addressed to the
1357,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"_Christ-kind_, had sent it to the palace with a respectful inquiry"
1358,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,as to what should be done with a letter so strangely directed. Queen
1359,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Louisa read it and, as a handmaid of the _Christ-kind_, she answered"
1360,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,his little children.[1]

1364,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,Louisa’s sympathies were ever ready to flow for the sorrows of
1365,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"childhood, which so many grown people will not stoop to even notice."
1366,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1367,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"One day as the king and queen were entering a town, a band of young"
1368,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,girls came forward to strew flowers and to present a nosegay. Her
1369,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"majesty inquired how many little girls there were. “Nineteen,” replied"
1370,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,the artless child; “there would have been twenty of us but one was sent
1371,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,back home because she was too ugly.”
1372,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1373,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,The kind queen feeling for the child’s mortification sent for her
1374,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,and requested that she might by all means be allowed to join in the
1375,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,festivities of the day.
1376,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1377,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,Nor did Louisa slight the boys.
1378,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1379,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"She was one day walking in the streets of Charlottenburg, attended"
1380,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,by a lady-in-waiting; a number of boys were running and tumbling and
1381,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"playing somewhat rudely, and one of them ran up against the queen. Her"
1382,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"lady reproved him sharply, and the little fellow looked frightened"
1383,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"and abashed. The queen patted his rosy cheek, saying: “Boys will be a"
1384,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"little wild; never mind, my dear boy, I am not angry.” She then asked"
1385,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,his name and bade him give her compliments to his mother. The child
1386,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"knew who the lady was, and besides having the pleasant memory of her"
1387,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,gracious speech and looks received a lesson in politeness which he
1388,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,never forgot.
1389,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1390,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Sometimes the royal children were allowed to have a party, and this"
1391,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,indulgence young princes and princesses enjoy just as much as other
1392,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,juveniles. A queer anecdote is told of the only daughter of the famous
1393,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Madame de Stael, in relation to one of these entertainments."
1394,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1395,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"The little lady was about ten years of age, but had already imbibed"
1396,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,many opinions and prejudices. At all events she had a high idea of her
1397,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"own importance, and was totally wanting in respect for her superiors in"
1398,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,rank. She was apt to be very rude in her manners and in her remarks.
1399,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,On this occasion she took offence at something which the little Crown
1400,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Prince said or did to her, and very coolly gave him a sharp box on the"
1401,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"ear, upon which he ran crying to his mother and hid his face in the"
1402,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"folds of her dress. As mademoiselle, when remonstrated with, showed"
1403,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"not a particle of concern, and refused to say she was sorry, she was"
1404,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"not invited again, and her learned mamma found that she must keep her"
1405,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,daughter at home until she taught her better manners.[2]

1409,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"The annual fair at Paretz, the king’s beloved country home, took place"
1410,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,during the merry harvest-time. A number of booths were then put up near
1411,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"the village, and besides buying and selling there was a great deal or"
1412,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"dancing and singing going on, and all sorts of games and sports. It was"
1413,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,then that the wheel of fortune was turned for the children’s lottery.
1414,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"Lots of cakes and fruit were set round in order, which were given away"
1415,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"according to the movements of a pointer, turned by the wheel."
1416,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1417,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,Queen Louisa encouraged the children to crowd around her on these
1418,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"occasions; she could not bear to see them afraid of her, and placed"
1419,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"herself beside the wheel, in order to secure fair play and to watch"
1420,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,carefully that she might make some amends for the unkindness of
1421,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,fortune. She had her own ample store of good things which she dispensed
1422,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"among the unlucky children, many of whom thought more of the sweet"
1423,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,words and looks of the queen than of anything else she could give
1424,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,them. Moreover she was glad to have a chance of leading even one of
1425,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"her little subjects to be generous and self-denying. For, while she"
1426,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"liked to see them all happy, she at the same time interested herself in"
1427,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,giving pleasantly little hints as to conduct that might be of lasting
1428,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,benefit.
1429,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,
1430,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,All her life Queen Louisa watched beside the wheel in a higher sense.
1431,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,"She overlooked the whole circle of which she was the centre, anxiously"
1432,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,seeking to hold out a helping hand to any whom she saw likely to be
1433,BY MARY STUART SMITH.,ruined by losses in the great lottery of real life.

1449,BY M. S. P.,Doubtless the readers of GRAMMAR SCHOOL have heard it said that “Men
1450,BY M. S. P.,and Women are only children of a larger growth.” No matter how stately
1451,BY M. S. P.,"the grand ladies that we often meet with may appear, you may be very"
1452,BY M. S. P.,"sure that they sometimes envy the pleasures of children, who have no"
1453,BY M. S. P.,"thoughts about fine houses and servants, and a hundred other cares."
1454,BY M. S. P.,Even wearing a crown does not bring happiness; the dignity it entails
1455,BY M. S. P.,often becomes burdensome.
1456,BY M. S. P.,
1457,BY M. S. P.,"Once a young prince, who had everything that he could possibly want"
1458,BY M. S. P.,"given him,--books, jewels, playthings of inconceivable variety, horses"
1459,BY M. S. P.,"and dogs, in fact all the nice things that you can imagine to bring"
1460,BY M. S. P.,"him pleasure,--was observed by his attendants to be standing by the"
1461,BY M. S. P.,"window, crying. When asked the cause of his tears he replied that he"
1462,BY M. S. P.,was unhappy because he could not join the boys in the street who were
1463,BY M. S. P.,making mud pies!
1464,BY M. S. P.,
1465,BY M. S. P.,The Indians who use the bow and arrow say that the proper way to keep
1466,BY M. S. P.,the strength of their bows is to unstring them after use and let them
1467,BY M. S. P.,relax. So it is with those whose minds or bodies are engaged in one
1468,BY M. S. P.,long strain of work; they must be relaxed or they become useless. The
1469,BY M. S. P.,"late Pope of Rome was a very dignified old man, and was also surrounded"
1470,BY M. S. P.,by learned and great men. He rode in a gilded coach drawn by four
1471,BY M. S. P.,"horses, and was in public a very grand and stately person. But I read"
1472,BY M. S. P.,the other day that the old gentleman and some of his cardinals were
1473,BY M. S. P.,"once seen playing ball in his garden, for the purpose of amusing a"
1474,BY M. S. P.,little boy.
1475,BY M. S. P.,
1476,BY M. S. P.,"More than a hundred years ago the great country east of Germany, known"
1477,BY M. S. P.,"as Russia, was ruled by the Empress Anne. It is a very cold country and"
1478,BY M. S. P.,"the winter is very long. The capital is St. Petersburg, and through"
1479,BY M. S. P.,"it the river Neva runs. This river freezes in winter, and the ice is"
1480,BY M. S. P.,frequently so solid that it will bear up an army of several thousand
1481,BY M. S. P.,"men with all their heavy guns and mortars, and these be discharged"
1482,BY M. S. P.,without so much as cracking the ice.
1483,BY M. S. P.,
1484,BY M. S. P.,"At the close of the year 1739, during an extremely cold winter, the"
1485,BY M. S. P.,empress ordered one of her architects to build an _Ice Palace_. The
1486,BY M. S. P.,great square in front of the royal palace was chosen for its site.
1487,BY M. S. P.,"Blocks of the clearest ice were selected, carefully measured and even"
1488,BY M. S. P.,ornamented with architectural designs. They were raised with cranes and
1489,BY M. S. P.,"carefully placed in position, and were cemented together by the pouring"
1490,BY M. S. P.,of water over them. The water soon froze and made the blocks one solid
1491,BY M. S. P.,"wall of ice. The palace was fifty-six feet long, seventeen and one half"
1492,BY M. S. P.,"feet wide, and twenty-one feet high. Can you imagine anything more"
1493,BY M. S. P.,beautiful than such a building made of transparent ice and sparkling in
1494,BY M. S. P.,the sun?
1495,BY M. S. P.,
1496,BY M. S. P.,"It was surrounded by a balustrade, behind which were placed six ice"
1497,BY M. S. P.,"cannon on carriages. These cannon were exactly like real metal ones,"
1498,BY M. S. P.,and were so hard and solid that powder could be fired in them. The
1499,BY M. S. P.,charge used was a quarter of a pound of powder and a ball of oakum. At
1500,BY M. S. P.,the first trial of the cannon an iron ball was used. The empress with
1501,BY M. S. P.,"all her court was present, and the ball was fired. It pierced a plank"
1502,BY M. S. P.,two inches thick at a distance of sixty feet.
1503,BY M. S. P.,
1504,BY M. S. P.,Besides these six cannon in front of the palace there were two ice
1505,BY M. S. P.,mortars which carried iron balls weighing eighty pounds with a charge
1506,BY M. S. P.,"of one quarter of a pound of powder. Then, too, there were two ice"
1507,BY M. S. P.,"dolphins, from whose mouths a flame of burning naptha was thrown at"
1508,BY M. S. P.,"night with most wonderful effect. Between the cannon and dolphins, in"
1509,BY M. S. P.,"front of the palace, there was a balustrade of ice ornamented with"
1510,BY M. S. P.,square pillars. Along the top of the palace there was a gallery and a
1511,BY M. S. P.,balustrade which was ornamented with round balls. In the centre of this
1512,BY M. S. P.,stood four beautiful ice statues.
1513,BY M. S. P.,
1514,BY M. S. P.,The frames of the doors and windows were painted green to imitate
1515,BY M. S. P.,"marble. There were two entrances to the palace, on opposite sides,"
1516,BY M. S. P.,leading into a square vestibule which had four windows. All the
1517,BY M. S. P.,"windows were made of perfectly transparent ice, and at night they were"
1518,BY M. S. P.,"hung with linen shades on which grotesque figures were painted, and"
1519,BY M. S. P.,illuminated by a great number of candles.
1520,BY M. S. P.,
1521,BY M. S. P.,Before entering the palace one naturally stopped to admire the pots of
1522,BY M. S. P.,"flowers on the balustrade, and the orange trees on whose branches birds"
1523,BY M. S. P.,were perching. Think of the labor and patience required to make such
1524,BY M. S. P.,perfect imitations of nature _in ice_!
1525,BY M. S. P.,
1526,BY M. S. P.,"Standing in the vestibule, facing one entrance and having another"
1527,BY M. S. P.,"behind, one could see a door on either hand. Let us imagine ourselves"
1528,BY M. S. P.,"in the room on the left. It is a sleeping-room apparently, but if you"
1529,BY M. S. P.,stop to think that every article in it is made of ice you will hardly
1530,BY M. S. P.,care to spend a night there; and yet it is said that two persons
1531,BY M. S. P.,actually slept on the bed there for an entire night. On one side is
1532,BY M. S. P.,"a toilet-table. Over it hangs a mirror, on each side of which are"
1533,BY M. S. P.,candelabra with ice candles. Sometimes at night these candles were
1534,BY M. S. P.,"lit by being dipped in naptha. On the table is a watch-pocket, and a"
1535,BY M. S. P.,"variety of vases, boxes, and ornaments of curious and beautiful design."
1536,BY M. S. P.,"At the other side of the room we see the bed hung with curtains,"
1537,BY M. S. P.,"furnished with sheets and a coverlid and two pillows, on which are"
1538,BY M. S. P.,placed two night-caps. By the side of the bed on a foot-stool are
1539,BY M. S. P.,two pairs of slippers. Opposite the bed is the fireplace which is
1540,BY M. S. P.,beautifully carved and ornamented. In the grate lie sticks of wood also
1541,BY M. S. P.,"made of ice, which are sometimes lighted like the candles by having"
1542,BY M. S. P.,naptha poured over them.
1543,BY M. S. P.,
1544,BY M. S. P.,The opposite room is a dining-room. In the centre stands a table on
1545,BY M. S. P.,which is a clock of most wonderful workmanship. The ice used is so
1546,BY M. S. P.,transparent that all the wheels and works are visible. On each side
1547,BY M. S. P.,"of this table two beautifully carved sofas are placed, and in the"
1548,BY M. S. P.,corners of the room there are statues. On one side we see a sideboard
1549,BY M. S. P.,covered with a variety of ornaments. We open the doors and find inside
1550,BY M. S. P.,"a tea-set, glasses and plates which contain a variety of fruits and"
1551,BY M. S. P.,"vegetables, all made of ice but painted in imitation of nature."
1552,BY M. S. P.,
1553,BY M. S. P.,Let us now go through the opposite door and notice the other curious
1554,BY M. S. P.,things outside the palace. At each end of the balustrade we see a
1555,BY M. S. P.,pyramid with an opening in each side like the dial of a clock. These
1556,BY M. S. P.,"pyramids are hollow, and at night a man stands inside of them and"
1557,BY M. S. P.,exhibits illuminated pictures at the grand openings.
1558,BY M. S. P.,
1559,BY M. S. P.,Perhaps the greatest curiosity of all is the life-like elephant at the
1560,BY M. S. P.,"right of the palace. On his back sits a Persian holding a battle-axe,"
1561,BY M. S. P.,"and by his side stand two men as large as life. The elephant, too, is"
1562,BY M. S. P.,"hollow, and is so constructed that in the daytime a stream of water is"
1563,BY M. S. P.,"thrown from his trunk to a height of twenty-four feet, and at night a"
1564,BY M. S. P.,"flame of burning naptha. In addition to this, the wonderful animal is"
1565,BY M. S. P.,so arranged that from time to time he utters the most natural cries.
1566,BY M. S. P.,This is done by means of pipes into which air is forced.
1567,BY M. S. P.,
1568,BY M. S. P.,"On the left of the palace stands a small house, built of round blocks"
1569,BY M. S. P.,"of ice resembling logs, interlaced one with another. This is the"
1570,BY M. S. P.,"bath-house, without which no Russian establishment is complete. This"
1571,BY M. S. P.,bath-house was actually heated and used on several occasions.
1572,BY M. S. P.,
1573,BY M. S. P.,When this wonderful ice-palace was completed it was thrown open to the
1574,BY M. S. P.,"public, and such crowds came to see it that sentinels were stationed in"
1575,BY M. S. P.,the house to prevent disorder.
1576,BY M. S. P.,
1577,BY M. S. P.,This beautiful palace stood from the beginning of January until the end
1578,BY M. S. P.,"of March. Then, as the weather became warmer, it began to melt on the"
1579,BY M. S. P.,south side; but even after it lost its beauty and symmetry as a palace
1580,BY M. S. P.,"it did not become entirely useless, for the largest blocks of ice were"
1581,BY M. S. P.,"transferred to the ice-houses of the imperial palace, and thus afforded"
1582,BY M. S. P.,"grateful refreshment during the summer, as well as a pleasant reminder"
1583,BY M. S. P.,of “_The Plaything of an Empress_.”

1591,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1592,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1593,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,Charlie was going to Boston.
1594,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1595,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,The ceaseless clatter of his little copper-toed boots over all the bare
1596,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"places in the house, and the pertinacious hammering he kept up upon"
1597,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"everything capable of emitting sound, rendered it impossible for his"
1598,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"mamma or the new baby to get any rest, and so it was that the decision"
1599,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"came about. Aunt Mary, who had lent her presence to the household for"
1600,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"the preceding fortnight, was to return home the following day, and with"
1601,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"her, after infinite discussion, it was decided that he was to go for a"
1602,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,week.
1603,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1604,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"The momentous news was withheld from Charlie until the next morning,"
1605,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"for fear of the result upon his night’s sleep, but it was injudiciously"
1606,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"let out by Aunt Mary before breakfast, the effect being to at once"
1607,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,plunge the young gentleman into the highest state of excitement. He
1608,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,had played “go to Boston” a thousand times with his little cart and
1609,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"wheelbarrow, but to take such a journey in reality was something he"
1610,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,could hardly imagine possible.
1611,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1612,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Am I going to Boston, real ’live?” he wildly inquired. “Where’s my"
1613,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"rubber boots, and my little chair, and my cart, and I want my piece of"
1614,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"gum mamma tooked away, and where’s my sled?”"
1615,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1616,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“But, Charlie,” said Aunt Mary, persuasively, “you are not going now,"
1617,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,and you don’t want to take all those things. There isn’t any snow
1618,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"in Boston, and good little boys don’t chew gum. You must have some"
1619,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,breakfast.”
1620,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1621,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“I don’t want any breakfast. I want to go to Boston. I got to go, now"
1622,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,you said so.”
1623,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1624,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Yes, but you must have something to eat first. It would make you sick"
1625,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"to ride so far without eating. And then you must have a nice bath, and"
1626,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,put on your new suit that papa bought last week. You’ve plenty of time.”
1627,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1628,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"But Charlie, generally good to mind, was thoroughly demoralized by the"
1629,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"new turn in affairs, and had to be brought to the table by main force."
1630,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1631,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“It’s like taking a horse to water,” said Aunt Mary. “You can get him"
1632,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"to the trough, but you can’t make him drink without he likes. Charlie,"
1633,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,have a nice large griddle-cake?”
1634,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1635,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Griddle-cakes were Charlie’s weak point, but in a time like this he"
1636,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,rose superior to the temptation.
1637,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1638,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“Don’t want griddle-cakes; don’t want bread; don’t want toast; don’t
1639,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"want anything. I want to get right down out of my little chair, and go"
1640,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"to Boston, awful quick!”"
1641,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1642,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“The child will be down sick if he goes away on an empty stomach,” said"
1643,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"grandma from her bedroom, where she could see all that transpired at"
1644,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the table. “Can’t you make him eat?”
1645,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1646,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“It’s all very well to say ‘Make him eat,’ but he won’t,” said Aunt"
1647,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,Mary. “You might just as well make a squirrel sit down and eat in a
1648,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,respectable manner.”
1649,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1650,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Let him go till he gets hungry, then,” said his father. “He’ll come to"
1651,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,it soon enough. There’s no danger of his starving.”
1652,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1653,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"If Charlie had been a grown man, with whiskers, and going to some"
1654,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"European Court as Minister Extraordinary, he couldn’t have felt the"
1655,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"importance of his prospective journey more, or been more weighed down"
1656,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,by the preparations for it. The train which was to carry him did not
1657,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"start until two o’clock, and in the six hours which intervened his"
1658,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"little tongue was in constant motion, and his little feet tramping up"
1659,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and down stairs, “getting ready.”"
1660,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1661,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“But you’re only going to stay for a week, you know, Charlie,” said"
1662,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Aunt Mary, dismayed at the heap of toys he had industriously gathered"
1663,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"in a corner of the sitting-room for transportation, “and you’ll see so"
1664,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,many pretty things that you won’t care for any of these.”
1665,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1666,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“I want to carry my wheelbarrow. I will be cross if I don’t carry my
1667,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"wheelbarrow. And my cunnin’ little cunnin’ watlin’ pot, and my high"
1668,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"chair, and some more.”"
1669,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1670,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"But Aunt Mary couldn’t get them into her trunk, and the railroad"
1671,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,man wouldn’t let Charlie take them into the cars. “Put them all away
1672,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"nicely, and then Charlie will have them when he comes home.”"
1673,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1674,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"It required a great deal of judicious argument, intermingled with"
1675,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"promises, to gain the point, and final success was only achieved by a"
1676,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"formal agreement, to which grandma was made a witness, by virtue of"
1677,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"which Charlie was to become the possessor of “a speckled rocking-horse,"
1678,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"just like Johnny Baker’s, with real hair ears, and a tight tail,"
1679,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"that boys couldn’t pull out.” This compact having been made, Charlie"
1680,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,submitted to the washing and dressing process with comparative good
1681,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,grace.
1682,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1683,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"An exceedingly light dinner preceded the start, varied by excursions to"
1684,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"the front door to see if the depot stage was coming. It came at last,"
1685,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and, after the leave-taking, Charlie and Aunt Mary were packed in among"
1686,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"half a dozen others. The whip cracked, the coach gave a sudden lurch,"
1687,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and then dashed down the street at the heels of the horses, who seemed"
1688,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,anxious to get to the station at the earliest possible moment. There
1689,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,was just time to get tickets and seats before the train started.
1690,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1691,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"If Charlie was unmanageable before, he was doubly so now. At every"
1692,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"stopping-place he made desperate efforts to get out of the car, and"
1693,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"once or twice, in spite of Aunt Mary’s efforts, very nearly succeeded."
1694,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,He dropped his hat out of the window; he dirtied his face beyond
1695,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,redemption with dust and cinders; he put cake crumbs down the neck
1696,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"of an old lady who had fallen asleep on the seat just in front, and"
1697,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,horrified the more staid portion of the passengers in the car by a
1698,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"series of acts highly inconsistent with the rules of good breeding, and"
1699,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the character of a nice boy.
1700,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1701,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Boston was reached at last, and the perils of procuring a hack and"
1702,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,getting safely home in it were surmounted. So thankful was Aunt Mary
1703,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,that she could have dropped upon her knees on the sidewalk in front of
1704,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"the door; but she managed to control her feelings, paid the hackman"
1705,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"his dollar, still keeping a tight grip upon Charlie, and, despite his"
1706,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"struggles to join the distant audience of a hand-organ, managed to get"
1707,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"him safely into the house, where he was at once delivered over to the"
1708,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,other members of the household.
1709,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1710,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“I never, never, _never_ will go out of the house with that child"
1711,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"again!” she declared, half crying, and sinking into a chair without"
1712,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,taking her bonnet off. “He’s enough to kill anyone outright. No wonder
1713,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,they wanted to get rid of him at home! It’ll be a mercy if he don’t
1714,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"drive us all crazy before the week is out. One thing is certain,"
1715,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,they’ll have to send for him. _I’ll_ never take him home again.”
1716,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1717,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Why didn’t you drug him, Aunt Mary,” asked Tom, with a great show of"
1718,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,sympathy. “_I_ would.”
1719,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1720,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“I declare I would have done anything, if I had only known how he was"
1721,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"going to act! You may laugh and think it’s all very funny, but I just"
1722,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,wish you’d some of you try it yourselves. Where is he now? If he’s out
1723,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,of sight a single minute he’ll be in some mischief. There he goes now!”
1724,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1725,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,The last declaration of Aunt Mary was preceded by a series of violent
1726,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"bumps, followed by a loud scream from the bottom of the basement"
1727,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"stairs. A grand rush to the spot revealed Charlie lying at the foot,"
1728,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"beating the air with his legs, with a vigor that at once dispelled all"
1729,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,fears as to his serious injury. He was picked up and borne into the
1730,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"kitchen by the cook, where the gift of a doughnut soon dried his tears,"
1731,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,and he was returned to the sitting-room to await the ringing of the
1732,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,bell for tea.
1733,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1734,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“Has he had a nap to-day?” asked grandmother.
1735,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1736,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“Nap! I should think the child would be dead for want of sleep. I don’t
1737,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,believe he’s winked to-day!”
1738,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1739,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“He looks like it now, anyway,” said Tom, who was holding him in his"
1740,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,arms.
1741,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1742,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Sure enough, his eyelids were beginning to droop, and a moment after"
1743,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the half-eaten doughnut dropped from his loosened fingers upon the
1744,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,carpet.
1745,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1746,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Carry him up to my room, Tom, and lay him upon my bed. Don’t for"
1747,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,mercy’s sake hit his head against anything. We shan’t have any peace if
1748,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,he gets awake again.”
1749,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1750,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Slowly and carefully Tom staggered under his little burden up-stairs,"
1751,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,and laid it upon the clean white coverlet of Aunt Mary’s bed.
1752,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1753,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“That will do,” said Aunt Mary, who had followed close behind. “He’s"
1754,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"thoroughly tired out, and no wonder. You may go down now and I will"
1755,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"take care of him, dear little fellow.”"
1756,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1757,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"With careful fingers she untied the laces of his little boots, and"
1758,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"pulled them off. The stockings came next, and the hot little feet"
1759,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"were released from confinement. The tiny jacket was then removed, the"
1760,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"tangled hair put back, and then, with a sponge wet in cool water,"
1761,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"the dirty, sweaty little face was softly bathed until it became quite"
1762,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,presentable again.
1763,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1764,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“There!” she said at last, surveying him with a feeling of"
1765,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"satisfaction, “he will sleep at least a couple of hours. By that time"
1766,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"I shall get rested, and can manage him better. I suppose it’s because"
1767,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"he’s so tired, and everything is new.”"
1768,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1769,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"With this apology for Charlie in her heart, and a half remorseful"
1770,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"feeling for her lately displayed impatience, she descended the stairs"
1771,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"to the dining-room, where the rest of the family were already seated at"
1772,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the table.
1773,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1774,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"A few minutes later, and while she was deep in an account of matters"
1775,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and things at Charlie’s home, the cook came up-stairs in something of a"
1776,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,fluster.
1777,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1778,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Plaze, ma’am, there’s something on the house.”"
1779,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1780,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“Something on the house?”
1781,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1782,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Yes. McKillop’s boarders across the way are all at the windows, an’"
1783,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the men is laughin’ and the women frightened.”
1784,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1785,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,With one accord a sudden and informal adjournment to the parlor window
1786,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"was made, the result being a verification of the cook’s statement."
1787,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1788,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,“What on earth can be the matter?” said grandmother.
1789,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1790,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"At this moment Mrs. McKillop, after a series of incomprehensible"
1791,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"gestures, which nobody could translate with any clearness, dispatched"
1792,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,her girl across the street.
1793,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1794,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“There’s a child, ma’am,” she exclaimed, in breathless excitement, “a"
1795,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"baby, walking about on the outside of your house like a fly! he’s--"
1796,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,Howly Father!”
1797,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1798,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"This sudden exclamation was caused by the descent of a flower pot,"
1799,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"which, coming with the swiftness of a meteor, missed the head of the"
1800,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"speaker by less than a hand’s-breadth, and crashed into a thousand"
1801,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,pieces on the front steps.
1802,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1803,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,The situation was taken in at once. With a succession of screams Aunt
1804,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,Mary flew up the stairs two at a time. By this a crowd was rapidly
1805,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,gathering.
1806,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1807,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“Bring out something to catch him in if he falls,” shouted a fat old"
1808,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"gentleman, pushing his way to the front."
1809,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1810,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Grandmother caught a tidy from the arm of the sofa, and, snatching a"
1811,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"volume of Tennyson from the centre-table, rushed frantically into the"
1812,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"street, closely followed by Tom with a feather duster."
1813,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1814,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"A single glance told the whole story. There sat Charlie, utterly"
1815,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"innocent of clothing save a shirt of exceeding scantness, on the very"
1816,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"edge of the broad projection below the third-story window, his legs"
1817,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"dangling in space, watching with delighted interest the proceedings of"
1818,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the excited crowd in the street below. No one knows what might have
1819,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"happened, for, at that moment, while a hot discussion was being carried"
1820,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"on among the gathered spectators, as to the propriety of sounding"
1821,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"a fire alarm for a hook and ladder company, the arms of Aunt Mary"
1822,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"came through the window, and closed upon him like a pair of animated"
1823,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"pincers. There was a brief struggle, productive of a perfect shower"
1824,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"of flower-pots, and then, amid a hurricane of shouts and cheers, the"
1825,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"little white body and kicking legs disappeared within the room. When,"
1826,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"two minutes later, the entire household, with a fair sprinkling of the"
1827,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"McKillop boarders, had reached the scene, they found Charlie shut up"
1828,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"in the wardrobe, and Aunt Mary in hysterics, with her back against the"
1829,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,door.
1830,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1831,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"“If he stays here a week we shall have to board up the windows, and"
1832,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"keep a policeman,” said grandmother, that night, after Charlie had been"
1833,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"guarded to sleep on the sitting-room lounge, with the door locked. “We"
1834,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"shall have to have watchers for him, for I would no more dare to go"
1835,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,to sleep without some one awake with him than I would trust him with
1836,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,a card of matches and a keg of gunpowder. And that makes me think:
1837,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"we musn’t leave matches where he can get them; and, father, you’ll"
1838,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"have to go down town the first thing in the morning, and see about an"
1839,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,insurance.”
1840,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1841,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Notwithstanding the universally expressed fears, Charlie slept like a"
1842,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"top all night, and really behaved so well the next morning that it was"
1843,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"deemed safe to give him an airing, and introduce him to the sights of"
1844,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"Boston. Right after dinner he was taken in hand, and dressed and curled"
1845,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and frilled as he never had been before, creating serious doubts in his"
1846,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"own mind as to whether he was really himself, or another boy of about"
1847,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,the same size and general make.
1848,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1849,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"At half-past two o’clock the party set out, Aunt Mary on one side,"
1850,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"tightly grasping Charlie’s hand, and on the other a female friend,"
1851,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,especially engaged for the occasion. Tom followed on behind as a sort
1852,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"of rear guard, ready to be called upon in case of emergency."
1853,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,
1854,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,First the Public Garden was visited. Hardly had half the circuit of the
1855,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"lake been made, when Charlie, attracted by one of the gayly painted"
1856,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"boats which was moored a few feet from the shore, broke loose and made"
1857,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"a sudden dash to reach it, to the utter ruin of his stockings and"
1858,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,gaiters. In vain Aunt Mary coaxed and remonstrated and threatened; in
1859,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,vain she attempted to hook him out with the handle of her parasol; he
1860,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,was just out of reach and he kept there. He was brought out by one
1861,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"of the gardeners at last, who seemed to look upon it as an excellent"
1862,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"joke. Tom, who had lagged behind, was sent back after dry stockings"
1863,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"and Charlie’s second-best shoes, which, when brought, were changed"
1864,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"in the vestibule of the Public Library, and the line of march again"
1865,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"taken up. The deer on the Common were fed, Punch and Judy viewed and"
1866,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"criticized, and the thousand and one various objects in the vicinity"
1867,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"visited. Charlie was delighted with everything, but through and above"
1868,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,all one grand desire and determination rode rampant--the desire and
1869,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"determination to enter into possession of the promised, but as yet"
1870,BY CHARLES E. HURD.,"unrealized, “wocking-horse.”"

1902,LOOKING HORSE.”],"“Perhaps,” suggested a pitying apothecary’s clerk, with a very small"

1922,LOOKING HORSE.”],"“I’m going back. I can’t stay here. I can help search,” said Aunt Mary,"

1925,LOOKING HORSE.”],
1926,LOOKING HORSE.”],"Tom had hurried away without stopping to listen, and was now out of"

1929,LOOKING HORSE.”],"was at last reached, and again the oft repeated inquiries were made,"
1930,LOOKING HORSE.”],but with the same result.
1931,LOOKING HORSE.”],
1932,LOOKING HORSE.”],"“Here is where I was intending to bring him,” said Aunt Mary, pausing"
1933,LOOKING HORSE.”],"mournfully before the window of a toy-bazar crowded with drums,"
1934,LOOKING HORSE.”],"guns, trumpets and wooden monkeys. “He had talked so much about his"

1936,LOOKING HORSE.”],
1937,LOOKING HORSE.”],"The sentence was never finished, for, with a half hysterical shriek,"
1938,LOOKING HORSE.”],"she dropped her parasol upon the sidewalk and rushed into the store,"
1939,LOOKING HORSE.”],"where the apparition of a curly head of flaxen hair, slowly oscillating"
1940,LOOKING HORSE.”],"back and forth, had that instant caught her eye. It was Charlie, sure"
1941,LOOKING HORSE.”],"enough, in the highest feather, mounted upon the back of the largest"
1942,LOOKING HORSE.”],"and realest-looking horse in the entire stock of the establishment,"
1943,LOOKING HORSE.”],whose speed he was endeavoring to accelerate by the aid of divers

1947,LOOKING HORSE.”],"Aunt Mary, despite her regard for appearances, hugged him and cried"

1950,LOOKING HORSE.”],
1951,LOOKING HORSE.”],"“He’s been here nigh upon two hours,” said the proprietor, as he made"
1952,LOOKING HORSE.”],change for the coveted horse. “He came in alone and went right to
1953,LOOKING HORSE.”],"that horse, and there he’s stuck ever since. I don’t let boys handle"
1954,LOOKING HORSE.”],"’em much without I know they’re going to buy, but he made me think so"

1957,LOOKING HORSE.”],
1958,LOOKING HORSE.”],No mishap occurred in getting Charlie home this time. The toyman’s boy

1961,LOOKING HORSE.”],beyond what happens to ordinary boys who are carried about in hacks.
1962,LOOKING HORSE.”],Some little difficulty was experienced in getting him out on arrival

1967,LOOKING HORSE.”],"indignation by the driver, who expressed a vehement wish to himself"

2015,A WONDERFUL TRIO.,
2016,BY JANE HOWARD.,BY JANE HOWARD.
2017,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2018,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2019,BY JANE HOWARD.,In a little stone hut among the mountains lived Gredel and her son
2020,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin, and this is how they lived: They kept about a dozen goats;"
2021,BY JANE HOWARD.,"and all they had to do was to watch them browse, milk them, and make"
2022,BY JANE HOWARD.,"the butter and cheese, which they partly ate and partly sold down in"
2023,BY JANE HOWARD.,"the village, or, rather, exchanged for bread. They were content with"
2024,BY JANE HOWARD.,"bread, butter, and cheese; and all they thought about was the goats."
2025,BY JANE HOWARD.,"As for their clothes, it would be impossible to speak of them with"
2026,BY JANE HOWARD.,"patience. They had no ambition, no hope, no thought beyond the day, and"
2027,BY JANE HOWARD.,"no sense of gratitude towards yesterday. So they lived, doing no harm,"
2028,BY JANE HOWARD.,"and effecting little good; careless of the future, and not honestly"
2029,BY JANE HOWARD.,proud of anything they had done in the past.
2030,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2031,BY JANE HOWARD.,But one day Gredel (who was the widow of a shepherd that had dropped
2032,BY JANE HOWARD.,"over the edge of a cliff) sat slowly churning the previous day’s milk,"
2033,BY JANE HOWARD.,"while Peterkin sat near her, doing nothing at all, thinking nothing at"
2034,BY JANE HOWARD.,"all, because he had nothing to ponder over, and looking at nothing at"
2035,BY JANE HOWARD.,"all, for the goats were an everyday sight, and they took such capital"
2036,BY JANE HOWARD.,care of themselves that Peterkin always stared away over their heads.
2037,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2038,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Heigho!” suddenly exclaimed Gredel, stopping in her churning; and"
2039,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin dropped his stick, looked at his mother slowly, and obediently"
2040,BY JANE HOWARD.,"repeated, “Heigho!”"
2041,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2042,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“The sun rises,” said Gredel, “and the sun sets; the day comes, and the"
2043,BY JANE HOWARD.,"day goes; and we were yesterday, and we are to-day, and we shall be for"
2044,BY JANE HOWARD.,"some tomorrows; and that is all, all, all.”"
2045,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2046,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Said Peterkin, “Mother, what is there in the world?”"
2047,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2048,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Men and women,” repeated the wise parent; “goats, and many other"
2049,BY JANE HOWARD.,things.”
2050,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2051,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“But is it the end of life to get up, watch goats, eat and drink, and"
2052,BY JANE HOWARD.,fall asleep again? Sometimes I wonder what is on the other side of the
2053,BY JANE HOWARD.,hill.”
2054,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2055,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Who can say what is the end of life?” asked slow-thoughted Gredel.
2056,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Are you not happy?”
2057,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2058,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Yes. But there is something more.”
2059,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2060,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Do you not love me--your mother?”
2061,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2062,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Yes. But still I think--think--think.”
2063,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2064,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Love is enough,” said Gredel, who had passed more than half way"
2065,BY JANE HOWARD.,"through life, and was content to rest."
2066,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2067,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Then it must be,” said Peterkin, “that I want more than enough.”"
2068,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2069,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“If so, you must be wicked,” remarked Gredel; “for I am at peace in"
2070,BY JANE HOWARD.,"loving you, and you should be content in loving me. What more do you"
2071,BY JANE HOWARD.,want? You have enough to eat--a warm bed in winter--and your mother who
2072,BY JANE HOWARD.,loves you.”
2073,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2074,BY JANE HOWARD.,Peterkin shook his head.
2075,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2076,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“It will rain to-night,” said Gredel; “and you will be warm while many"
2077,BY JANE HOWARD.,will be shivering in the wet.”
2078,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2079,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Gredel was quite right; for when the sun had set, and the heavens were"
2080,BY JANE HOWARD.,"all of one dead, sad color, down came the rain, and the inside of the"
2081,BY JANE HOWARD.,hut looked very warm and comfortable.
2082,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2083,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Nevertheless, Peterkin still thought of the something beyond the"
2084,BY JANE HOWARD.,"mountain, and wondered what it might be. Had some wise one whispered in"
2085,BY JANE HOWARD.,"his ear, he must have learnt that it was healthy ambition, which helped"
2086,BY JANE HOWARD.,the world and the worker at the same time.
2087,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2088,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Soon it began to thunder, and Peterkin lazily opened the wooden"
2089,BY JANE HOWARD.,shutters to look at the lightning.
2090,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2091,BY JANE HOWARD.,"By this time Gredel, having thanked Providence for a large bowl of"
2092,BY JANE HOWARD.,"black bread steeped in hot goat’s milk, was nodding and bobbing towards"
2093,BY JANE HOWARD.,the flaming wood fire.
2094,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2095,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Mother mother! here comes something from this world!”
2096,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2097,BY JANE HOWARD.,“And what comes from the world?”
2098,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2099,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Something like three aged women, older than you are a very great deal."
2100,BY JANE HOWARD.,Let me wait for another flash of lightening. Ha! The first has a big
2101,BY JANE HOWARD.,stick; the second has a great pair of round things on her eyes; and
2102,BY JANE HOWARD.,"the third has a sack on her back, but it is as flat as the palm of my"
2103,BY JANE HOWARD.,"hand, and can have nothing in it.”"
2104,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2105,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Is there enough bread, and cheese, and milk, and salt in the"
2106,BY JANE HOWARD.,house?--We must consider.”
2107,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2108,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Aye,” answered Peterkin; “there is plenty of each and all.”"
2109,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2110,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Then let them come in, if they will,” said Gredel. “But they shall"
2111,BY JANE HOWARD.,"knock at the door first, for we go not out on the highways and in the"
2112,BY JANE HOWARD.,byways to help others. Let them come to us--good. But let us not go to
2113,BY JANE HOWARD.,"them, for they have their business, and we have ours; and so the world"
2114,BY JANE HOWARD.,goes round!”
2115,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2116,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“They are near the door,” whispered Peterkin, “and very good old women"
2117,BY JANE HOWARD.,they look.”
2118,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2119,BY JANE HOWARD.,The next moment there was a very soft and civil tapping at the door.
2120,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2121,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Who goes there?” asked Peterkin.
2122,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2123,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Three honest old women,” cried a voice."
2124,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2125,BY JANE HOWARD.,“And what do three honest old women want?” called Gredel.
2126,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2127,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“A bit of bread each,” replied the voice, “a mug of milk each, and one"
2128,BY JANE HOWARD.,corner for all three to sleep in until in the morning up comes the
2129,BY JANE HOWARD.,sweet yellow sun.”
2130,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2131,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Lift up the latch,” said Gredel. “Come in. There is bread, there is"
2132,BY JANE HOWARD.,"milk, and a corner laid with three sacks of thistle down. Come in, and"
2133,BY JANE HOWARD.,welcome.”
2134,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2135,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Then up went the latch, and in stepped the three travellers. Gredel"
2136,BY JANE HOWARD.,looked at them without moving; but when she saw they were pleasant in
2137,BY JANE HOWARD.,"appearance--that their eyes were keen in spite of their many wrinkles,"
2138,BY JANE HOWARD.,and that their smiles were very fresh and pleasant notwithstanding the
2139,BY JANE HOWARD.,"lines about their mouth, lazy but good-hearted Gredel got up and made a"
2140,BY JANE HOWARD.,neat little bow of welcome.
2141,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2142,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Are you sisters?” she asked.
2143,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2144,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“We are three sisters,” answered the leader, she who carried the"
2145,BY JANE HOWARD.,stick. “I am commonly called Sister Trot.”
2146,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2147,BY JANE HOWARD.,[Illustration: IN STEPPED THE THREE.]
2148,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2149,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And I,” said the second, who wore the spectacles, “am commonly called"
2150,BY JANE HOWARD.,Sister Pansy.”
2151,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2152,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And I,” added the third, who carried the bag, “am styled Sister"
2153,BY JANE HOWARD.,Satchel.”
2154,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2155,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Your mother and father must have been a good-looking couple,” said"
2156,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Gredel, smiling."
2157,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2158,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“They were born handsome,” quoth Trot, rearing her head proudly, “and"
2159,BY JANE HOWARD.,they grew handsomer.”
2160,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2161,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“How came they to grow handsomer?” asked Peterkin, who had been"
2162,BY JANE HOWARD.,standing in a corner.
2163,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2164,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Because they were brisk and hurried about,” replied Pansy, “and never"
2165,BY JANE HOWARD.,"found the day too long. But pray, sir, who are you?”"
2166,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2167,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I am Peterkin, son of Gredel.”"
2168,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2169,BY JANE HOWARD.,“And may I ask what you do?” inquired Trot.
2170,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2171,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Watch the goats.”
2172,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2173,BY JANE HOWARD.,“And what do you do when you watch the goats?”
2174,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2175,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Look about.”
2176,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2177,BY JANE HOWARD.,“What do you see when you look about?” asked Sister Pansy.
2178,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2179,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“The sky, and the earth, and the goats.”"
2180,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2181,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Ah!” said Pansy, “it is very good to look at the sky, and truly wise"
2182,BY JANE HOWARD.,"to look at the earth, while it is clever to keep an eye on the goats;"
2183,BY JANE HOWARD.,but Peterkin--Peterkin--you do not look far enough!”
2184,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2185,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And when you look about,” queried Sister Satchel, “what do you pick"
2186,BY JANE HOWARD.,up?”
2187,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2188,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Nothing,” said Peterkin."
2189,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2190,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Nothing!” echoed the visitor. “What! not even an idea?”
2191,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2192,BY JANE HOWARD.,“What is an idea?” asked Peterkin.
2193,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2194,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Oh, oh, oh!” said the three sisters. “Here is Peterkin, who not only"
2195,BY JANE HOWARD.,"never picks up an idea, but actually does not know what one is!”"
2196,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2197,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“This comes of not moving about,” said Trot."
2198,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2199,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Of not looking about,” said Pansy."
2200,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2201,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And of not picking up something every day,” said Satchel. “And a worse"
2202,BY JANE HOWARD.,"example I, for one, never came across.”"
2203,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2204,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Nor I!” “Nor I!” echoed the other sisters.
2205,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2206,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Whereupon they all looked at Peterkin, and seemed dreadfully serious."
2207,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2208,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Why, whatever have I done?” he demanded."
2209,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2210,BY JANE HOWARD.,“That’s just it!” said the sisters. “_What_ have you done?”
2211,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2212,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Nothing!” exclaimed Peterkin, quite with the intention of justifying"
2213,BY JANE HOWARD.,himself. “Nothing at all!”
2214,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2215,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Ah!” said Trot, “_that_ is the truth, indeed; whatever else may be"
2216,BY JANE HOWARD.,wrong--done nothing at all!”
2217,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2218,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Nothing!” “Nothing!” repeated Satchel and Pansy, in a breath."
2219,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2220,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Dear me!” said Peterkin.
2221,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2222,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Whereupon Gredel, half-frightened herself, and partly indignant that"
2223,BY JANE HOWARD.,"her boy should be lamented over in this uncalled-for manner, said,"
2224,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Would you be pleased to take a seat?”
2225,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2226,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Certainly!” said Trot. “Still I, for one, would not think of such a"
2227,BY JANE HOWARD.,thing until your stools were dusted.”
2228,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2229,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Gredel could _not_ believe her eyes, for actually Trot raised one end"
2230,BY JANE HOWARD.,"of her stick and it became a brush, with which she dusted three stools."
2231,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2232,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I think, too,” said Sister Pansy, looking out sharp through her"
2233,BY JANE HOWARD.,"spectacles, “that if we were to stop up that hole in the corner we"
2234,BY JANE HOWARD.,"should have less draught. As a rule, holes are bad things in a house.”"
2235,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2236,BY JANE HOWARD.,"So off she went, and stopped up the hole with a handful of dried grass"
2237,BY JANE HOWARD.,she took from a corner.
2238,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2239,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Bless me!” said Satchel; “here are four pins on the floor!”
2240,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2241,BY JANE HOWARD.,Whereupon she picked up the pins and popped them into her wallet.
2242,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Meanwhile Gredel looked on, much astonished at these preceedings."
2243,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2244,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I may as well have a rout while I am about it,” said Trot, beginning"
2245,BY JANE HOWARD.,at once to sweep up.
2246,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2247,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Cobwebs in every corner!” cried Pansy; and away she went, looking"
2248,BY JANE HOWARD.,after the walls.
2249,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2250,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“No wonder you could not find your wooden spoon,” remarked Satchel;"
2251,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“why, here it is, most mysteriously up the chimney!”"
2252,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2253,BY JANE HOWARD.,"There was such a dusting, sweeping, and general cleaning as the place"
2254,BY JANE HOWARD.,had never seen before.
2255,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2256,BY JANE HOWARD.,“This is great fun!” said Peterkin; “but how it makes you sneeze!”
2257,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2258,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Here, dame Gredel,” cried Satchel; “I have picked up all the things"
2259,BY JANE HOWARD.,you must have lost for the last three years. Here is your thimble; and
2260,BY JANE HOWARD.,now you can take the bit of leather off your finger. Here are your
2261,BY JANE HOWARD.,"scissors, which will cut cloth better than that knife; and here is the"
2262,BY JANE HOWARD.,lost leg of the third stool--so that I can now sit down in safety.”
2263,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2264,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Why,” exclaimed Peterkin, “the place looks twice as large as it did,"
2265,BY JANE HOWARD.,"and ten times brighter. Mother, I am glad the ladies have come.”"
2266,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2267,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I am sure, ladies,” said the good woman, “I shall never forget your"
2268,BY JANE HOWARD.,visit.”
2269,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2270,BY JANE HOWARD.,"To tell the truth, however, there was something very ambiguous in"
2271,BY JANE HOWARD.,Gredel’s words.
2272,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2273,BY JANE HOWARD.,“There!” said Trot; “and now I can sit down in comfort to my bread and
2274,BY JANE HOWARD.,milk.”
2275,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2276,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And very good bread and milk, too,” said Satchel. “I think, sisters,"
2277,BY JANE HOWARD.,we are quite fortunate to fall upon this goodly cot.”
2278,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2279,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Yes,” remarked Trot, “they are not bad souls, this Gredel and"
2280,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin; but, they sadly want mending. However, they have good hearts,"
2281,BY JANE HOWARD.,and you know that those who love much are forgiven much; and indeed
2282,BY JANE HOWARD.,"I would sooner eat my supper here than in some palaces you and I,"
2283,BY JANE HOWARD.,"sisters, know something about.”"
2284,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2285,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Quite true!” assented the others, “quite true!” And so they went on"
2286,BY JANE HOWARD.,talking as though they had been in their own house and no one but
2287,BY JANE HOWARD.,"themselves in the room. Gredel listened with astonishment, and Peterkin"
2288,BY JANE HOWARD.,"with all his ears, too delighted even to be astonished."
2289,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2290,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Now this,” thought he, “comes of their knowing something of what goes"
2291,BY JANE HOWARD.,on beyond the Great Hill as far away as I can see.”
2292,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2293,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Time for bed,” suddenly said Dame Trot, who evidently was the leader,"
2294,BY JANE HOWARD.,“if we are to see the sun rise.”
2295,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2296,BY JANE HOWARD.,"The sisters then made themselves quite comfortable, and tucked up their"
2297,BY JANE HOWARD.,thistle-down beds and home-spun sheets with perfect good humor.
2298,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2299,BY JANE HOWARD.,*       *       *       *       *
2300,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2301,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin awoke cheerily, and he was dressed even before the sun"
2302,BY JANE HOWARD.,"appeared. He made the fire, set the table, gave the place a cheerful"
2303,BY JANE HOWARD.,"air, and then opened the door to look after the goats, wondering why he"
2304,BY JANE HOWARD.,"felt so light and happy. He was soon joined by the three sisters, who"
2305,BY JANE HOWARD.,made a great to-do with some cold water and their washing.
2306,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2307,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Is it good to put your head souse in a pail?” asked Peterkin.
2308,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2309,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Try it,” replied Dame Trot."
2310,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2311,BY JANE HOWARD.,"So by this time, quite trusting the old women, he did so, and found"
2312,BY JANE HOWARD.,"his breath gone in a moment. However, he enjoyed breathing all the"
2313,BY JANE HOWARD.,"more when he found his head once more out of the pail, and after Pansy"
2314,BY JANE HOWARD.,"had rubbed him dry with a rough towel, which she took out of Satchel’s"
2315,BY JANE HOWARD.,"wallet, he thought he had never experienced such a delightful feeling"
2316,BY JANE HOWARD.,as then took possession of him. Even since the previous night he felt
2317,BY JANE HOWARD.,"quite a new being, and alas! he found himself forgetting Gredel--his"
2318,BY JANE HOWARD.,"mother Gredel, who loved him and taught him only to live for to-day."
2319,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2320,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“And shall I show you down the hill-side?” asked Peterkin, when the"
2321,BY JANE HOWARD.,three sisters had taken their porridge and were sprucing themselves for
2322,BY JANE HOWARD.,departure.
2323,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2324,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Yes,” said dame Trot, “and glad am I thou hast saved us the trouble of"
2325,BY JANE HOWARD.,asking thee.”
2326,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2327,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“A good lad,” remarked Pansy to Gredel, “but he must look about him.”"
2328,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2329,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Truly,” said Satchel. “And, above all, he must pick up everything he"
2330,BY JANE HOWARD.,"comes across, when he can do so without robbing a neighbor, and he may"
2331,BY JANE HOWARD.,"steal all his neighbor _knows_, without depriving the gentleman of"
2332,BY JANE HOWARD.,anything.”
2333,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2334,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Then Peterkin, feeling as light as a feather, started off down the"
2335,BY JANE HOWARD.,"hillside, the three old sisters chatting, whispering, and chuckling"
2336,BY JANE HOWARD.,"in a very wonderful manner. So, when they were quite in the valley,"
2337,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin said, “Please you, I will leave you now, ladies; and many"
2338,BY JANE HOWARD.,"thanks for your coming.” Then he very civilly touched his tattered cap,"
2339,BY JANE HOWARD.,"and was turning on his battered heels, when Sister Trot said, “Stop!”"
2340,BY JANE HOWARD.,and he turned.
2341,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2342,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Peterkin,” she said, “thou art worth loving and thinking about, and"
2343,BY JANE HOWARD.,for your kindness to us wanderers we must ask you to keep something in
2344,BY JANE HOWARD.,"remembrance of our visit. Here, take my wonderful stick and believe"
2345,BY JANE HOWARD.,"in it. You know me as Trot, but grown-up men call me the Fairy"
2346,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Work-o’-Day.” Peterkin made his obeisance, and took the stick."
2347,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2348,BY JANE HOWARD.,“I will never lose it!” said he.
2349,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2350,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“You never will,” said Trot, “after once you know how to use it.”"
2351,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2352,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Well,” said sister Pansy, “I am not to be beaten by my sister, and so"
2353,BY JANE HOWARD.,here are my spectacles.”
2354,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2355,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I shall look very funny in them,” said Peterkin, eyeing them"
2356,BY JANE HOWARD.,doubtfully.
2357,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2358,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Nay; nobody will see them on your nose as you mark them on mine. The
2359,BY JANE HOWARD.,"world will observe their wisdom in your eyes, but the wires will be"
2360,BY JANE HOWARD.,"invisible. By-the-by, sister Pansy is only my home-name; men call me"
2361,BY JANE HOWARD.,Fairy See-far; and so be good.”
2362,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2363,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“As for me,” said the third sister, “I am but the younger of the"
2364,BY JANE HOWARD.,family. I could not be in existence had not my sisters been born into
2365,BY JANE HOWARD.,"the world. I am going to give you my sack; but take heed, it were"
2366,BY JANE HOWARD.,better that you had no sack at all than that you should fill it too
2367,BY JANE HOWARD.,full; than that you should fling into it all that you see; than that
2368,BY JANE HOWARD.,"you should pass by on the other side when, your sack being full,"
2369,BY JANE HOWARD.,"another human being, fallen amongst thieves, lies bleeding and wanting"
2370,BY JANE HOWARD.,"help! And now know that, though I am sometimes called Satchel, my name"
2371,BY JANE HOWARD.,amongst the good people is the Fairy Save-some.”
2372,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2373,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Good by,” suddenly said the three sisters. They smiled, and instantly"
2374,BY JANE HOWARD.,they were gone--just like _Three Thoughts_.
2375,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2376,BY JANE HOWARD.,"So he turned his face towards home, with sorrow in his heart as he"
2377,BY JANE HOWARD.,"thought of the three sisters, while hope was mixed with the sadness as"
2378,BY JANE HOWARD.,he glanced towards the far-off mountain which was called Mons Futura.
2379,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2380,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Now, Peterkin had never cared to climb hillsides, and, therefore he"
2381,BY JANE HOWARD.,"rarely went down them if he could help it, always lazily stopping at"
2382,BY JANE HOWARD.,"the top. But now the wonderful stick, as he pressed it upon the ground,"
2383,BY JANE HOWARD.,"seemed to give him a light heart, and a lighter pair of heels, and he"
2384,BY JANE HOWARD.,"danced up the hillside just as though he were holiday-making, soon"
2385,BY JANE HOWARD.,reaching home.
2386,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2387,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“See, mother,” said Peterkin, “the good women have given me each a"
2388,BY JANE HOWARD.,"present--the one her stick, the second her glasses, and the third her"
2389,BY JANE HOWARD.,wallet.”
2390,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2391,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Ho!” said Gredel. “Well, I am not sorry they are gone, for I am afraid"
2392,BY JANE HOWARD.,they would soon have made you despise your mother. They are very
2393,BY JANE HOWARD.,"pleasant old people no doubt, but rude and certainly ill-bred, or they"
2394,BY JANE HOWARD.,would not have put my house to rights.”
2395,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2396,BY JANE HOWARD.,“But it looked all the better for it.”
2397,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2398,BY JANE HOWARD.,“It looked very well as it was.”
2399,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2400,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“But the world goes on and on,” said Peterkin."
2401,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2402,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Gredel shook her head. “Humph!” she said, “a stick, an old pair of"
2403,BY JANE HOWARD.,"spectacles, and a sack not worth a dime! When people give gifts, let"
2404,BY JANE HOWARD.,them be gifts and not cast-offs.”
2405,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2406,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Anyhow,” said Peterkin, “I can tell you that the stick is a good"
2407,BY JANE HOWARD.,"stick, and helps you over the hill famously. I will keep it, and you"
2408,BY JANE HOWARD.,may have the sack and the spectacles.”
2409,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2410,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Let us try your spectacles,” cried Gredel. “_Oh!_” she said, trying"
2411,BY JANE HOWARD.,them on carelessly. “These are the most wonderful spectacles in the
2412,BY JANE HOWARD.,"world,” she went on; “but no more civil than those three old women.”"
2413,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2414,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“What do you mean, mother?”"
2415,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2416,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I see you, Peterkin--and a very sad sight, too. Why, you are lazy,"
2417,BY JANE HOWARD.,"careless, unwashed, and stupid; and a more deplorable object was never"
2418,BY JANE HOWARD.,seen by honest woman.”
2419,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2420,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Poor Peterkin blushed very much; but at this point, his mother taking"
2421,BY JANE HOWARD.,"off the glasses, he seized and placed them before his own eyes. “_Oh!_”"
2422,BY JANE HOWARD.,he exclaimed.
2423,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2424,BY JANE HOWARD.,“What now?” asked Gredel in some alarm.
2425,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2426,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Now I see you as you are--and a very bad example are you to set before
2427,BY JANE HOWARD.,"your own son! Why, you are careless, and love me not for myself but"
2428,BY JANE HOWARD.,"yourself, or you would do your best for me, and send me out in the"
2429,BY JANE HOWARD.,world.”
2430,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2431,BY JANE HOWARD.,“What? And dare you talk to your mother in such fashion? Give me the
2432,BY JANE HOWARD.,spectacles once more!” and she clapped them on again. “Bless me!” she
2433,BY JANE HOWARD.,"continued, “the boy is quite right, and I see I am selfish, and that I"
2434,BY JANE HOWARD.,"am making him selfish--a very pretty business, indeed! This is to be"
2435,BY JANE HOWARD.,"thought over,” she said, laying aside the spectacles."
2436,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2437,BY JANE HOWARD.,"By this time Peterkin had possessed himself of the stick, and then, to"
2438,BY JANE HOWARD.,"his amazement, he found it had taken the shape of a spade."
2439,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2440,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Well,” said he, “as here is a spade I think I will turn over the"
2441,BY JANE HOWARD.,potato-patch.” This he did; and coming in to breakfast he was
2442,BY JANE HOWARD.,"admonished to find how fine the milk tasted. “Mother,” said he, “here"
2443,BY JANE HOWARD.,is a penny I have found in the field.”
2444,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2445,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Put it in the bag,” said Gredel."
2446,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2447,BY JANE HOWARD.,"He did so, and immediately there was a chink."
2448,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2449,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Over he turned the sack, and lo! there were ten pennies sprinkled on"
2450,BY JANE HOWARD.,the table.
2451,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2452,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Ho, ho,” said Peterkin, “if, now, the bag increases money after such a"
2453,BY JANE HOWARD.,"pleasant manner, I have but to take out one coin and cast it in again,"
2454,BY JANE HOWARD.,and soon I shall have a fortune.” He did so; but he heard no chinking.
2455,BY JANE HOWARD.,"He inverted the bag again, and out fell the one coin he had picked up"
2456,BY JANE HOWARD.,while digging the potato-patch.
2457,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2458,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“This, now, is very singular,” he said; “let me put on the spectacles.”"
2459,BY JANE HOWARD.,"This done, “Ha!” he cried, “I see now how it is. The money will never"
2460,BY JANE HOWARD.,"grow in the sack, unless one works hard; and then it increases whether"
2461,BY JANE HOWARD.,one will or not.”
2462,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2463,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Meanwhile Gredel, taking up the stick, it took the shape of a broom,"
2464,BY JANE HOWARD.,"and upon the hint she swept the floor. Next, sitting down before"
2465,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Peterkin’s clothes, the stick became a needle, and she stitched away"
2466,BY JANE HOWARD.,with a will.
2467,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2468,BY JANE HOWARD.,"So time rolled on. The cottage flourished, and the garden was"
2469,BY JANE HOWARD.,"beautiful. Then a cow was brought home, and it was wonderful how often"
2470,BY JANE HOWARD.,"fresh money changed in the wallet. Gredel had grown handsomer, and so"
2471,BY JANE HOWARD.,also had Peterkin. But one day it came to pass that Peterkin said:
2472,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“Mother, it is time I went over the great hill.”"
2473,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2474,BY JANE HOWARD.,“What! canst thou leave me?”
2475,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2476,BY JANE HOWARD.,“Thou didst leave thy father and mother.”
2477,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2478,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Gredel was wiser than she had been, and so she quietly said: “Let us"
2479,BY JANE HOWARD.,"put on the spectacles. Ah! I see,” she then said, “a mother may love"
2480,BY JANE HOWARD.,"her son, but she must not stand in his way as he goes on in the world,"
2481,BY JANE HOWARD.,or she becomes his enemy.”
2482,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2483,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Then Peterkin put on the spectacles. “Ah! I see,” said he, “a son may"
2484,BY JANE HOWARD.,"love his mother, but his love must not interfere with his duty to"
2485,BY JANE HOWARD.,other men. The glasses say that every man should try and leave the
2486,BY JANE HOWARD.,world something the better for his coming; that many fail and but few
2487,BY JANE HOWARD.,"succeed, yet that all must strive.”"
2488,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2489,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“So be it,” said Gredel. “Go forth into the world, my son, and leave me"
2490,BY JANE HOWARD.,hopeful here alone.”
2491,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2492,BY JANE HOWARD.,“The glasses say that the sense of duty done is the greatest happiness
2493,BY JANE HOWARD.,"in the world,” said Peterkin."
2494,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2495,BY JANE HOWARD.,Then Gredel looked again through the glasses.
2496,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2497,BY JANE HOWARD.,"“I see,” said she; “the glasses say it is better to have loved and lost"
2498,BY JANE HOWARD.,"than never to have loved at all. Go forth into the world, my son: we"
2499,BY JANE HOWARD.,shall both be the happier for having done our duty.”
2500,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2501,BY JANE HOWARD.,So out into the world went Peterkin.
2502,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2503,BY JANE HOWARD.,"What else is there to tell? Why, who can write of to-morrow?"
2504,BY JANE HOWARD.,
2505,BY JANE HOWARD.,"By the way, you should know that amongst the very wise folk sister"
2506,BY JANE HOWARD.,"Trot is known as “Industry,” sister Pansy as “Foresight,” while honest"
2507,BY JANE HOWARD.,Satchel is generally called “Economy.”

2519,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2520,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2521,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"One afternoon I went over to see Fred Barnard, and found him sitting on"
2522,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"the back steps, apparently meditating."
2523,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2524,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“What are you doing?” said I.
2525,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2526,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Waiting for that handkerchief to dry,” said he, pointing to a red one"
2527,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"with round white spots, which hung on the clothes-line."
2528,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2529,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“And what are you going to do when it’s dry?” said I.
2530,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2531,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Tie up my things in it,” said he."
2532,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2533,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“Things! What things?”
2534,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2535,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“O, such things as a fellow needs when he’s traveling. I’m going to"
2536,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,seek my fortune.”
2537,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2538,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“Where are you going to seek it?” said I.
2539,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2540,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“I can’t tell exactly--anywhere and everywhere. I’m going till I find
2541,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,it.”
2542,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2543,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“But,” said I, “do you really expect to turn over a stone, or pull"
2544,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"up a bush, or get to the end of a rainbow, and find a crock full of"
2545,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,five-dollar gold pieces?”
2546,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2547,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“O, no!” said Fred. “Such things are gone by long ago. You can’t do"
2548,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"that nowadays, if you ever could. But people do get rich nowadays, and"
2549,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,there must be some way to do it.”
2550,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2551,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Don’t they get rich mostly by staying at home, and minding their"
2552,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"business,” said I, “instead of going off tramping about the world?”"
2553,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2554,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Maybe some of them do,” said Fred; “but my father has always staid at"
2555,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"home, and minded his business, and _he_ hasn’t got rich; and I don’t"
2556,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"believe he ever will. But there’s uncle Silas, he’s always on the go,"
2557,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,so you never know where to direct a letter to him; and he has lots
2558,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,of money. Sometimes mother tells him he ought to settle down; but he
2559,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"always says, if he did he’s afraid he wouldn’t be able to settle up by"
2560,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,and by.”
2561,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2562,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I thought of my own father, and my mother’s brother. They both staid at"
2563,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"home and minded their own business, yet neither of them was rich. This"
2564,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"seemed to confirm Fred’s theory, and I was inclined to think he was"
2565,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,more than half right.
2566,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2567,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I don’t know but I’d like to go with you,” said I."
2568,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2569,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I don’t want you to,” said Fred."
2570,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2571,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Why,” said I, in astonishment; “are we not good friends?”"
2572,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2573,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“O, yes, good friends as ever,” said Fred; “but you’re not very likely"
2574,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,to find two fortunes close together; and I think it’s better for every
2575,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,one to go alone.”
2576,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2577,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Then why couldn’t I start at the same time you do, and go a different"
2578,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,way?”
2579,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2580,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“That would do,” said Fred. “I’m going to start to-morrow morning.” And"
2581,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"he walked to the line, and felt of the handkerchief."
2582,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2583,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,[Illustration]
2584,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2585,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I can take mother’s traveling-bag,” said I. “That will be handier to"
2586,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,carry than a bundle tied up.”
2587,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2588,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Take it if you like,” said Fred; “but _I_ believe there’s luck in an"
2589,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,old-fashioned handkerchief. In all the pictures of boys going to seek
2590,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"their fortunes, they have their things tied up in a handkerchief, and a"
2591,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,stick put through it and over their shoulder.”
2592,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2593,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I did not sympathize much with Fred’s belief in luck, though I thought"
2594,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,it was possible there might be something in it; but the bundle in the
2595,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"handkerchief seemed to savor a little more of romance, and I determined"
2596,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,that I would conform to the ancient style.
2597,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2598,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“Does your father know about it?” said I.
2599,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2600,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“Yes; and he says I may go.”
2601,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2602,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,Just then Fred’s father drove around from the barn.
2603,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2604,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I’m going away,” said he to Fred, “to be gone several days. So, if you"
2605,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"go in the morning, I shall not see you again until you return from your"
2606,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,travels.” And he laughed a little.
2607,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2608,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Well, I’m certainly going to-morrow morning,” said Fred, in answer to"
2609,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,the “if.”
2610,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2611,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“You ought to have a little money with you,” said Mr. Barnard, taking"
2612,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,out his wallet.
2613,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2614,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“No, sir, I thank you,” said Fred; “but I’d rather not have it.”"
2615,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2616,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,His father looked surprised.
2617,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2618,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I think it’s luckier to start without it,” said Fred, in explanation."
2619,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2620,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Very well! Luck go with you!” said Mr. Barnard, as he drove off."
2621,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2622,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“Do you think it best to go without any money at all?” said I. “It
2623,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,seems to me it would be better to have a little.”
2624,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2625,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“No,” said Fred; “a fellow ought to depend on himself, and trust to"
2626,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,luck. It wouldn’t be any fun at all to stop at taverns and pay for
2627,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"meals and lodging, just like ordinary travelers. And then, if people"
2628,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"saw I had money to pay for things, they wouldn’t believe I was going to"
2629,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,seek my fortune.”
2630,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2631,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Why, do we want them to know that?” said I."
2632,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2633,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“_I_ do,” said he."
2634,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2635,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“That isn’t the way the boys in the stories do,” said I."
2636,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2637,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“And that’s just where they missed it,” said Fred; “or would, if they"
2638,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,lived nowadays. Don’t you see that everybody that wants anything lets
2639,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"everybody know it? When I’m on my travels, I’m going to tell every one"
2640,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,what I’m after. That’s the way to find out where to go and what to do.”
2641,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2642,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Won’t some of them fool you,” said I, “and tell you lies, and send you"
2643,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,on the wrong road?”
2644,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2645,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“A fellow’s got to look out for that,” said Fred, knowingly. “We"
2646,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,needn’t believe all they say.”
2647,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2648,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“What must we take in our bundles?” said I.
2649,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2650,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I’m going to take some cookies, and a Bible, and a tin cup, and a ball"
2651,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"of string, and a pint of salt,” said Fred."
2652,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2653,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“What’s the salt for?” said I.
2654,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2655,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“We may have to camp out some nights,” said Fred, “and live on what we"
2656,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,can find. There are lots of things you can find in the woods and fields
2657,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"to live on; but some of them ain’t good without salt--mushrooms, for"
2658,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,instance.” Fred was very fond of mushrooms.
2659,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2660,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“And is the string to tie up the bags of money?” said I--not meaning to
2661,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,be at all sarcastic.
2662,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2663,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“O, no!” said Fred; “but string’s always handy to have. We may want to"
2664,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"set snares for game, or tie up things that break, or catch fish. And"
2665,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,then if you have to stay all night in a house where the people look
2666,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"suspicious, you can fix a string so that if any one opens the door of"
2667,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"your room, it’ll wake you up.”"
2668,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2669,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“If that happened, you’d want a pistol--wouldn’t you?” said I. “Or else"
2670,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,it wouldn’t do much good to be waked up.”
2671,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2672,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I’d take a pistol, if I had one,” said Fred; “but I can get along"
2673,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"without it. You can always hit ’em over the head with a chair, or a"
2674,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"pitcher, or something. You know you can swing a pitcher full of water"
2675,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"around quick, and not spill a drop; and if you should hit a man a fair"
2676,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"blow with it, ’twould knock him senseless. Besides, it’s dangerous"
2677,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"using a pistol in a house. Sometimes the bullets go through the wall,"
2678,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,and kill innocent persons.”
2679,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2680,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“We don’t want to do that,” said I."
2681,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2682,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“No,” said Fred; “that would be awful unlucky.”"
2683,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2684,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"Then he felt of the handkerchief again, said he guessed it was dry"
2685,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"enough, and took it off from the line."
2686,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2687,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Fred,” said I, “how much _is_ a fortune?”"
2688,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2689,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“That depends on your ideas,” said Fred, as he smoothed the"
2690,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,handkerchief over his knee. “I should not be satisfied with less than a
2691,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,hundred thousand dollars.”
2692,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2693,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I ought to be going home to get ready,” said I. “What time do we"
2694,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,start?”
2695,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2696,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Five o’clock exactly,” said Fred."
2697,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2698,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"So we agreed to meet at the horse-block, in front of the house, a"
2699,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"minute or two before five the next morning, and start simultaneously on"
2700,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,the search for fortune.
2701,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2702,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I went home, and asked mother if there was a red handkerchief, with"
2703,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"round white spots on it, in the house."
2704,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2705,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I think there is,” said she. “What do you want with it?”"
2706,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2707,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I told her all about our plan, just as Fred and I had arranged it. She"
2708,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"smiled, said she hoped we would be successful, and went to get the"
2709,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,handkerchief.
2710,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2711,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"It proved to be just like Fred’s, except that the spots were yellow,"
2712,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"and had little red dots in the middle. I thought that would do, and"
2713,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"then asked her for the salt, the cup, and the cookies. She gave me her"
2714,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"pint measure full of salt, and as she had no cookies in the house, she"
2715,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,substituted four sandwiches.
2716,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2717,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“But,” said I, “won’t you want to use this cup before I get back?”"
2718,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2719,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I think not,” said she, with a twinkle in her eye, which puzzled me"
2720,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"then, but which afterward I understood."
2721,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2722,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I got my little Bible, and some twine, and then went into the yard to"
2723,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,hunt up a stick to carry the bundle on. I found a slender spoke from an
2724,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"old carriage-wheel, and adopted it at once. “That,” said I to myself,"
2725,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"as I handled and “hefted” it, “would be just the thing to hit a burglar"
2726,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,over the head with.”
2727,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2728,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"I fixed the bundle all ready for a start, and went to bed in good"
2729,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"season. Mother rose early, got me a nice breakfast, and called me at"
2730,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,half past four.
2731,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2732,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Mother,” said I, as feelings of gratitude rose within me at the"
2733,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"excellence of the meal, “how does a camel’s-hair shawl look?”"
2734,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2735,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“I don’t know, my son,” said she. “I never saw one.”"
2736,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2737,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Never saw one!” said I. “Well, you _shall_ see one, a big one, if I"
2738,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,find my fortune.”
2739,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2740,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Thank you,” said mother, and smiled again that peculiar smile."
2741,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2742,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,Fred and I met promptly at the horse-block. He greatly admired my
2743,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"stick; his was an old hoe-handle, sawed short. I gave him two of my"
2744,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"sandwiches for half of his cookies, and we tied up the bundles snugly,"
2745,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,and slung them over our shoulders.
2746,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2747,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,“How long do you think it will take us?” said I.
2748,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2749,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Maybe three or four years--maybe more,” said he."
2750,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,
2751,BY ROSSITER JOHNSON.,"“Let us agree to meet again on this spot five years, from to-day,” said"
2752,I.,I.
2753,I.,
2754,I.,"“All right!” said Fred; and he took out a bit of lead pencil, and wrote"
2755,I.,the date on the side of the block.
2756,I.,
2757,I.,"“The rains and snows will wash that off before the five years are up,”"
2758,I.,said I.
2759,I.,
2760,I.,"“Never mind! we can remember,” said Fred. “And now,” he continued, as"
2761,I.,"he shook hands with me, “don’t look back. _I’m_ not going to; it isn’t"
2762,I.,"lucky, and it’ll make us want to be home again. Good-bye!”"
2763,I.,
2764,I.,"“Good-bye! Remember, five years,” said I."
2765,I.,
2766,I.,"He took the east road, I the west, and neither looked back."
2767,I.,
2768,I.,I think I must have walked about four miles without seeing any human
2769,I.,"being. Then I fell in with a boy, who was driving three cows to"
2770,I.,"pasture, and we scraped acquaintance."
2771,I.,
2772,I.,"“Where y’ goin’?” said he, eyeing my bundle."
2773,I.,
2774,I.,"“A long journey,” said I."
2775,I.,
2776,I.,“Chiny?” said he.
2777,I.,
2778,I.,"“Maybe so--maybe not,” said I."
2779,I.,
2780,I.,“What y’ got t’ sell?” said he.
2781,I.,
2782,I.,"“Nothing,” said I; “I’m only a traveler not a peddler. Can you tell me"
2783,I.,whose house that is?”
2784,I.,
2785,I.,“That big white one?” said he; “that’s Hathaway’s.”
2786,I.,
2787,I.,"“It looks new,” said I."
2788,I.,
2789,I.,"“Yes, ’tis, spick an’ span,” said he. “Hathaway’s jest moved into it;"
2790,I.,used to live in that little brown one over there.”
2791,I.,
2792,I.,"“Mr. Hathaway must be rich,” said I."
2793,I.,
2794,I.,"“Jolly! I guess he is!--wish I was half as rich,” said the boy. “Made"
2795,I.,"’s money on the rise of prop’ty. Used to own all this land round here,"
2796,I.,when ’twas a howlin’ wilderness. I’ve heard dad say so lots o’ times.
2797,I.,There he is now.”
2798,I.,
2799,I.,“Who?--your father?” said I.
2800,I.,
2801,I.,"“No; Hathaway.” And the boy pointed to a very old, white-headed man,"
2802,I.,"who was leaning on a cane, and looking up at the cornice of the house."
2803,I.,
2804,I.,"“He looks old,” said I."
2805,I.,
2806,I.,"“He is, awful old,” said the boy. “Can’t live much longer. His"
2807,I.,daughter Nancy’ll take the hull. Ain’t no other relations.”
2808,I.,
2809,I.,"“How old is Nancy?” said I; and if I had been a few years older myself,"
2810,I.,the question might have been significant; but among all the methods I
2811,I.,"had thought over of acquiring a fortune, that of marrying one was not"
2812,I.,included.
2813,I.,
2814,I.,"“O, she’s gray-headed too,” said the boy, “’n a post, ’nd blind ’s a"
2815,I.,bat. I wish the old man couldn’t swaller a mouthful o’ breakfast till
2816,I.,he’d give me half what he’s got.” And with this charitable expression
2817,I.,"he turned with the cows into the lane, and I saw him no more."
2818,I.,
2819,I.,While I was meditating on the venerable but not venerated Mr. Hathaway
2820,I.,"and his property, a wagon came rumbling along behind me."
2821,I.,
2822,I.,"“Don’t you want to ride?” said the driver, as I stepped aside to let it"
2823,I.,pass.
2824,I.,
2825,I.,"I thanked him, and climbed to a place beside him on the rough seat. He"
2826,I.,"was in his shirt-sleeves, and wore a torn straw hat. He had reddish"
2827,I.,"side-whiskers, and his chin needed shaving, badly."
2828,I.,
2829,I.,"“Got far to go?” said he, as the team started up again."
2830,I.,
2831,I.,"“I expect to walk all day,” said I."
2832,I.,
2833,I.,"“Then you must get a lift when you can,” said he. “Don’t be afraid to"
2834,I.,"ask. A good many that wouldn’t invite you, as I did, would let you ride"
2835,I.,if you asked them.”
2836,I.,
2837,I.,I promised to remember his advice.
2838,I.,
2839,I.,“Ever drive a team?” said he.
2840,I.,
2841,I.,"“Not much,” said I."
2842,I.,
2843,I.,"“I want a good boy to drive team,” said he. “Suppose you could learn.”"
2844,I.,"And then he began to talk to the horses, and to whistle."
2845,I.,
2846,I.,“How much would you pay?” said I.
2847,I.,
2848,I.,"“I’d give a good smart boy ten dollars a month and board,” said he."
2849,I.,"“Git ap, Doc!”"
2850,I.,
2851,I.,“How much of that could he save?” said I.
2852,I.,
2853,I.,"“Save eight dollars a month easy enough, if he’s careful of his"
2854,I.,"clothes, and don’t want to go to every circus that comes along,” said"
2855,I.,he.
2856,I.,
2857,I.,I made a mental calculation: “Eight times twelve are ninety-six--into
2858,I.,"a hundred thousand--one thousand and forty-one years, and some months."
2859,I.,"O, yes! interest--well, nearly a thousand years.” Then I said aloud, “I"
2860,I.,guess I won’t hire; don’t believe I’d make a very good teamster.”
2861,I.,
2862,I.,"“I think you would; and it’s good wages,” said he."
2863,I.,
2864,I.,"“Nobody but Methuselah could get rich at it,” said I."
2865,I.,
2866,I.,“Rich?” said he. “Of course you couldn’t get rich teaming. If that’s
2867,I.,"what you’re after, I’ll tell you what you do: plant a forest. Timber’s"
2868,I.,"good property. The price of it’s more than doubled in ten years past,"
2869,I.,"and it’ll be higher yet. You plant a tree, and it’ll grow while you"
2870,I.,"sleep. Chess won’t choke it, and the weevil can’t eat it. You don’t"
2871,I.,"have to hoe it, nor mow it, nor pick it, nor rotate it, nor feed it,"
2872,I.,"nor churn it, nor nothing. That’s the beauty of it. And you plant a"
2873,I.,"forest of trees, and in time it’ll make you a rich man.”"
2874,I.,
2875,I.,“How much time?” said I.
2876,I.,
2877,I.,"“Well, that piece of timber you see over there,--that’s Eph Martin’s;"
2878,I.,"he’s going to cut it next season. The biggest trees must be--well,"
2879,I.,perhaps eighty years old. You reckon up the interest on the cost of the
2880,I.,"land, and you’ll see it’s a good investment. I wish I had such a piece.”"
2881,I.,
2882,I.,“Why don’t you plant one?” said I.
2883,I.,
2884,I.,"“O, I’m too old! My grandfather ought to have done it for me. Whoa!"
2885,I.,Doc. Whoa! Tim.”
2886,I.,
2887,I.,"He drew up at a large, red barn, where a man and a boy were grinding a"
2888,I.,"scythe. I jumped down, and trudged on."
2889,I.,
2890,I.,"After I had gone a mile or two, I began to feel hungry, and sat done"
2891,I.,"on a stone, under a great oak tree, to eat a sandwich. Before I knew"
2892,I.,"it I had eaten two, and then I was thirsty. There was a well in a"
2893,I.,"door-yard close by, and I went to it. The bucket was too heavy for me"
2894,I.,"to lift, and so I turned the salt out of my cup in a little pile on a"
2895,I.,"clean-looking corner of the well-curb, and drank."
2896,I.,
2897,I.,"The woman of the house came to the door, and took a good look at me;"
2898,I.,then she asked if I would not rather have a drink of milk. I said
2899,I.,"I would, and she brought a large bowlful, which I sat down on the"
2900,I.,door-step to enjoy.
2901,I.,
2902,I.,"Presently a sun-browned, barefooted boy, wearing a new chip hat, and"
2903,I.,"having his trousers slung by a single suspender, came around the corner"
2904,I.,"of the house, and stopped before me."
2905,I.,
2906,I.,“Got any Shanghais at your house?” said he.
2907,I.,
2908,I.,“No!”
2909,I.,
2910,I.,“Any Cochins?”
2911,I.,
2912,I.,“No!”
2913,I.,
2914,I.,“Any Malays?”
2915,I.,
2916,I.,“No!”
2917,I.,
2918,I.,“What _have_ you got?”
2919,I.,
2920,I.,"“About twenty common hens,” said I, perceiving that his thoughts were"
2921,I.,running on fancy breeds of fowls.
2922,I.,
2923,I.,“Don’t want to buy a nice pair of Shanghais--do you?” said he.
2924,I.,
2925,I.,"“I couldn’t take them to-day,” said I."
2926,I.,
2927,I.,"“Let’s go look at them,” said he; and I followed him toward the barn."
2928,I.,
2929,I.,"“This is _my_ hennery,” said he, with evident pride, as we came to a"
2930,I.,"small yard which was inclosed with a fence made of long, narrow strips"
2931,I.,"of board, set up endwise, and nailed to a slight railing. Inside was a"
2932,I.,"low shed, with half a dozen small entrances near the ground."
2933,I.,
2934,I.,"“Me and Jake built this,” said he. “Jake’s my brother.”"
2935,I.,
2936,I.,"He unbuckled a strap that fastened the gate, and we went inside. A few"
2937,I.,"fowls, of breeds unfamiliar to me, were scratching about the yard."
2938,I.,
2939,I.,“Don’t you call them nice hens?” said he.
2940,I.,
2941,I.,"“I guess they are,” said I; “but I don’t know much about hens.”"
2942,I.,
2943,I.,“Don’t you?” said he. “Then I’ll tell you something about them. There’s
2944,I.,"money in hens. Father says so, and I know it’s so. I made fifty-one"
2945,I.,dollars and thirteen cents on these last year. I wish I had a million.”
2946,I.,
2947,I.,"“A million dollars,” said I, “is a good deal of money. I should be"
2948,I.,satisfied with one tenth of that.”
2949,I.,
2950,I.,"“I meant a million hens,” said he. “I’d rather have a million hens than"
2951,I.,a million dollars.”
2952,I.,
2953,I.,I went through a mental calculation similar to the one I had indulged
2954,I.,"in while riding with the teamster: “Fifty-one, thirteen--almost two"
2955,I.,"thousand years. Great Cæsar! Yes, Great Cæsar sure enough! I ought"
2956,I.,to have begun keeping hens about the time Cassius was egging on the
2957,I.,conspirators to lay out that gentleman. But I forgot the interest
2958,I.,again. Call it fifteen hundred.”
2959,I.,
2960,I.,"“Let’s go in and look at the nests,” said the boy, opening the door of"
2961,I.,the shed.
2962,I.,
2963,I.,The nests were in a row of boxes nailed to the wall. He took out some
2964,I.,"of the eggs, and showed them to me. Several had pencil-writing on the"
2965,I.,"shell, intended to denote the breed. I remember _Gaim_, _Schanghy_, and"
2966,I.,_Cotching_.
2967,I.,
2968,I.,"“There’s a pair of Shanghais,” said he as he went out, pointing with"
2969,I.,"one hand while he tightened the gate-strap with the other, “that I’ll"
2970,I.,sell you for five dollars. Or I’ll sell you half a dozen eggs for six
2971,I.,dollars.”
2972,I.,
2973,I.,"I told him I couldn’t trade that day, but would certainly come and see"
2974,I.,him when I wanted to buy any fancy hens.
2975,I.,
2976,I.,"“If you see anybody,” said he, as we parted, “that wants a nice pair of"
2977,I.,"Shanghais reasonable, you tell ’em where I live.”"
2978,I.,
2979,I.,"“I will,” said I, and pushed on."
2980,I.,
2981,I.,"“Money in hens, eh?” said I to myself. “Then if they belonged to me,"
2982,I.,"I’d kill them, and get it out of them at once, notwithstanding the"
2983,I.,proverb about the goose.”
2984,I.,
2985,I.,"After some further journeying I came to a roadside tavern. A large,"
2986,I.,"square sign, with a faded picture of a horse, and the words SCHUYLER’S"
2987,I.,"HOTEL, faintly legible, hung from an arm that extended over the road"
2988,I.,from a high post by the pump.
2989,I.,
2990,I.,"I sat down on the steps, below a group of men who were tilted back in"
2991,I.,"chairs on the piazza. One, who wore a red shirt, and chewed a very"
2992,I.,"large quid of tobacco, was just saying,--"
2993,I.,
2994,I.,"“Take it by and through, a man can make wages at the mines, and that’s"
2995,I.,all he can make.”
2996,I.,
2997,I.,"“Unless he strikes a big nugget,” said a little man with one eye."
2998,I.,
2999,I.,"“He might be there a hundred years, and not do that,” said Red Shirt."
3000,I.,“I never struck one.”
3001,I.,
3002,I.,"“And again he might strike it the very first day,” said One Eye."
3003,I.,
3004,I.,"“Again he might,” said Red Shirt; “but I’d rather take my chances"
3005,I.,"keeping tavern. Look at Schuyler, now. He’ll die a rich man.”"
3006,I.,
3007,I.,The one who seemed to be Schuyler was well worth looking at. I had
3008,I.,never seen so much man packed into so much chair; and it was an exact
3009,I.,"fit--just enough chair for the man, just enough man for the chair."
3010,I.,"Schuyler’s boundary from his chin to his toe was nearly, if not"
3011,I.,"exactly, a straight line."
3012,I.,
3013,I.,“Die rich?” said One Eye. “He’s a livin’ rich; he’s rich to-day.”
3014,I.,
3015,I.,"“If any of you gentlemen want to make your fortune keeping a hotel,”"
3016,I.,"said Schuyler, “I’ll sell on easy terms.”"
3017,I.,
3018,I.,"“How much, ’squire?” said Red Shirt."

3022,I.,
3023,I.,"“Fifteen,” answered Schuyler."
3024,I.,
3025,I.,“Fifteen thousand--furniture and all?” said One Eye.
3026,I.,
3027,I.,"“Everything,” said Schuyler."
3028,I.,
3029,I.,"“Your gran’f’ther bought the place for fifteen hundred,” said One Eye."
3030,I.,“But money was wuth more then.”
3031,I.,
3032,I.,"While listening to this conversation, I had taken out my cookies, and I"
3033,I.,"was eating the last of them, when One Eye made his last recorded remark."
3034,I.,
3035,I.,"“Won’t you come in, sonny, and stay over night?” said Schuyler."
3036,I.,
3037,I.,"“Thank you, sir,” said I; “but I can’t stop.”"
3038,I.,
3039,I.,"“Then don’t be mussing up my clean steps,” said he."
3040,I.,
3041,I.,I looked at him to see if he was in earnest; for I was too hungry to
3042,I.,"let a single crum fall, and could not conceive what should make a muss."
3043,I.,The whole company were staring at me most uncomfortably. Without saying
3044,I.,"another word, I picked up my stick and bundle, and walked off."
3045,I.,
3046,I.,"“Thirteen thousand five hundred,” said I to myself, slowly,--“in three"
3047,I.,generations--four thousand five hundred to a generation. I ought to
3048,I.,"have come over with Christopher Columbus, and set up a tavern for the"
3049,I.,red-skins to lounge around. Then maybe if I never let any little Indian
3050,I.,"boys eat their lunches on the steps, I’d be a rich man now. Fifteen"
3051,I.,"thousand dollars--and so mean, so abominably mean--and such a crowd of"
3052,I.,"loafers for company. No, I wouldn’t keep tavern if I could get rich in"
3053,I.,one generation.”
3054,I.,
3055,I.,"At the close of this soliloquy, I found I had instinctively turned"
3056,I.,"towards home when I left Schuyler’s Hotel. “It’s just as well,” said"
3057,I.,"I, “just as well! I’d rather stay at home and mind my business, like"
3058,I.,"father, and not have any fortune, if that’s the way people get them"
3059,I.,nowadays.”
3060,I.,
3061,I.,"I had the good luck to fall in with my friend the teamster, who gave me"
3062,I.,"a longer lift than before, and sounded me once more on the subject of"
3063,I.,hiring out to drive team for him.
3064,I.,
3065,I.,"As I passed over the crest of the last hill in the road, I saw"
3066,I.,something in the distance that looked very much like another boy with a
3067,I.,bundle over his shoulder. I waved my hat. It waved its hat. We met at
3068,I.,"the horse-block, each carrying a broad grin the last few rods of the"
3069,I.,way.
3070,I.,
3071,I.,"“Let’s see your fortune,” said I, as I laid my bundle on the block."
3072,I.,
3073,I.,"“Let’s see yours,” said he, as he laid his beside it."
3074,I.,
3075,I.,"“You started the plan,” said I; “so you tell your adventures first.”"
3076,I.,
3077,I.,"Thereupon Fred told his story, which I give nearly in his own words."
3078,I.,
3079,I.,He traveled a long distance before he met with any incident. Then he
3080,I.,"came to a house that had several windows boarded up, and looked as"
3081,I.,"if it might not be inhabited. While Fred stood looking at it, and"
3082,I.,"wondering about it, he saw a shovelful of earth come out of one of"
3083,I.,"the cellar windows. It was followed in a few seconds by another, and"
3084,I.,"another, at regular intervals."
3085,I.,
3086,I.,"“I know how it is,” said Fred. “Some old miser has lived and died in"
3087,I.,that house. He used to bury his money in the cellar; and now somebody’s
3088,I.,digging for it. I mean to see if I can’t help him.”
3089,I.,
3090,I.,"Going to the window, he stooped down and looked in. At first he saw"
3091,I.,nothing but the gleam of a new shovel. But when he had looked longer he
3092,I.,discerned the form of the man who wielded it.
3093,I.,
3094,I.,"“Hello!” said Fred, as the digger approached the window to throw out a"
3095,I.,shovelful.
3096,I.,
3097,I.,“Hello! Who are you?” said the man.
3098,I.,
3099,I.,"“I’m a boy going to seek my fortune,” said Fred. “What are you digging"
3100,I.,for?”
3101,I.,
3102,I.,"“Digging for a fortune,” said the man, taking up another shovelful."
3103,I.,
3104,I.,“May I help you?” said Fred.
3105,I.,
3106,I.,"“Yes, if you like.”"
3107,I.,
3108,I.,“And have half?”
3109,I.,
3110,I.,"“Have all you find,” said the man, forcing down his shovel with his"
3111,I.,foot.
3112,I.,
3113,I.,"Fred ran around to the cellar door, laid down his bundle on the grass"
3114,I.,"beside it, and entered. The man pointed to an old shovel with a large"
3115,I.,"corner broken off, and Fred picked it up and went to work."
3116,I.,
3117,I.,Nearly half of the cellar bottom had been lowered about a foot by
3118,I.,"digging, and the man was lowering the remainder. With Fred’s help,"
3119,I.,"after about two hours of hard work, it was all cut down to the lower"
3120,I.,level.
3121,I.,
3122,I.,"Fred had kept his eyes open, and scrutinized every shovelful; but"
3123,I.,nothing like a coin had gladdened his sight. Once he thought he had
3124,I.,"one, and ran to the light with it. But it proved to be only the iron"
3125,I.,ear broken off from some old bucket.
3126,I.,
3127,I.,"“I guess that’ll do,” said the man, wiping his brow, when the leveling"
3128,I.,was completed.
3129,I.,
3130,I.,"“Do?” said Fred, in astonishment. “Why, we haven’t found any of the"
3131,I.,money yet.”
3132,I.,
3133,I.,“What money?”
3134,I.,
3135,I.,"“The money the old miser buried, of course.”"
3136,I.,
3137,I.,"The man laughed heartily. “I wasn’t digging for any miser’s money,”"
3138,I.,said he.
3139,I.,
3140,I.,"“You said so,” said Fred."
3141,I.,
3142,I.,"“O, no!” said the man. “I said I was digging for a fortune. Come and"
3143,I.,"sit down, and I’ll tell you all about it.”"
3144,I.,
3145,I.,They took seats on the highest of the cellar steps that led out of
3146,I.,doors.
3147,I.,
3148,I.,"“You see,” continued the man, “my wife went down cellar one day, and"
3149,I.,struck her forehead against one of those beams; and she died of it.
3150,I.,"If she had lived a week longer, she’d have inherited a very pretty"
3151,I.,property. So I’ve lowered the cellar floor; and if I should have
3152,I.,"another wife, her head couldn’t reach the beams, unless she was very"
3153,I.,"tall--taller than I am. So if _she_ inherits a fortune, the cellar"
3154,I.,won’t prevent us getting it. That’s the fortune I was digging for.”
3155,I.,
3156,I.,"“It’s a mean trick to play on a boy; and if I was a man, I’d lick you,”"
3157,I.,"said Fred, as he shouldered his bundle and walked away."
3158,I.,
3159,I.,Two or three miles farther down the road he came to a small blacksmith
3160,I.,"shop. The smith, a stout, middle-aged man, was sitting astride of a"
3161,I.,"small bench with long legs, making horseshoe nails on a little anvil"
3162,I.,that rose from one end of it.
3163,I.,
3164,I.,"Fred went in, and asked if he might sit there a while to rest."
3165,I.,
3166,I.,"“Certainly,” said the blacksmith, as he threw a finished nail into an"
3167,I.,open drawer under the bench. “How far have you come?”
3168,I.,
3169,I.,"“I can’t tell,” said Fred; “it must be as much as ten miles.”"
3170,I.,
3171,I.,“Got far to go?”
3172,I.,
3173,I.,“I don’t know how far. I’m going to seek my fortune.”
3174,I.,
3175,I.,"The smith let his hammer rest on the anvil, and took a good look at"
3176,I.,"Fred. “You seem to be in earnest,” said he."
3177,I.,
3178,I.,"“I am,” said Fred."
3179,I.,
3180,I.,“Don’t you know that gold dollars don’t go rolling up hill in these
3181,I.,"days, for boys to chase them, and we haven’t any fairies in this"
3182,I.,"country, dancing by moonlight over buried treasure?” said the smith."
3183,I.,
3184,I.,"“O, yes, I know that,” said Fred. “But people get rich in these days as"
3185,I.,much as ever they did. And I want to find out the best way to do it.”
3186,I.,
3187,I.,"“What is that nail made of?” said the smith, holding out one."
3188,I.,
3189,I.,"“Iron,” said Fred, wondering what that had to do with a boy seeking his"
3190,I.,fortune.
3191,I.,
3192,I.,“And that hammer?”
3193,I.,
3194,I.,“Iron.”
3195,I.,
3196,I.,“And that anvil?”
3197,I.,
3198,I.,“Iron.”
3199,I.,
3200,I.,"“Well, don’t you see,” said the smith, resting his hammer on the anvil,"
3201,I.,"and leaning over it toward Fred,--“don’t you see that everything"
3202,I.,depends on iron? A farmer can’t cultivate the ground until he has a
3203,I.,plow; and that plow is made of iron. A butcher can’t cut up a critter
3204,I.,until he has a knife; and that knife is made of iron. A tailor can’t
3205,I.,make a garment without a needle; and that needle is made of iron. You
3206,I.,"can’t build a ship without iron, nor start a mill, nor arm a regiment."
3207,I.,"The stone age, and the brass age, and the golden age are all gone by."
3208,I.,This is the iron age; and iron is the basis of all wealth. The richest
3209,I.,"man is the man that has the most iron. Railroads are made of iron, and"
3210,I.,the richest men are those that own railroads.”
3211,I.,
3212,I.,"“How can one man own a railroad?” said Fred, amazed at the vastness of"
3213,I.,such wealth.
3214,I.,
3215,I.,"“Well, he can’t exactly, unless he steals it,” said the smith."
3216,I.,
3217,I.,"“I should like to own a railroad,” said Fred; and he thought what fun"
3218,I.,"he might have, as well as profit, being conductor on his own train;"
3219,I.,“but I didn’t come to steal; I want to find a fortune honestly.”
3220,I.,
3221,I.,"“Then look for it in iron,” said the smith. “Iron in some form always"
3222,I.,paves the road to prosperity.”
3223,I.,
3224,I.,“Would blacksmithing be a good way?” said Fred.
3225,I.,
3226,I.,"“Now you’ve hit it,” said the smith. “I haven’t got rich myself, and"
3227,I.,probably never shall. But I didn’t take the right course. I was a
3228,I.,"sailor when I was young, and spent half my life wandering around the"
3229,I.,"world, before I settled down and turned blacksmith. I dare say if I had"
3230,I.,"learned the trade early enough, and had gone and set up a shop in some"
3231,I.,"large place, or some rising place, and hadn’t always been so low in my"
3232,I.,"charges, I might be a rich man.”"
3233,I.,
3234,I.,Fred thought the blacksmith must be a very entertaining and learned
3235,I.,"man, whom it would be pleasant as well as profitable to work with. So,"
3236,I.,"after thinking it over a few minutes, he said,--"
3237,I.,
3238,I.,“Do you want to hire a boy to learn the business?”
3239,I.,
3240,I.,"“I’ll give you a chance,” said the smith, “and see what you can do.”"
3241,I.,"Then he went outside and drew in a wagon, which was complete except"
3242,I.,"part of the iron-work, and started up his fire, and thrust in some"
3243,I.,small bars of iron.
3244,I.,
3245,I.,"Fred laid aside his bundle, threw off his jacket, and announced that"
3246,I.,"he was ready for work. The smith set him to blowing the bellows, and"
3247,I.,"afterward gave him a light sledge, and showed him how to strike the"
3248,I.,"red-hot bar on the anvil, alternating with the blows of the smith’s own"
3249,I.,hammer.
3250,I.,
3251,I.,At first it was very interesting to feel the soft iron give at every
3252,I.,"blow, and see the sparks fly, and the bars, and rods taking the"
3253,I.,well-known shapes of carriage-irons. But either the smith had reached
3254,I.,"the end of his political economy, or else he was too much in earnest"
3255,I.,"about his work to deliver orations; his talk now was of “swagging,” and"
3256,I.,"“upsetting,” and “countersinking,” and “taps,” and “dies”--all of which"
3257,I.,terms he taught Fred the use of.
3258,I.,
3259,I.,"Fred was quick enough to learn, but had never been fond of work; and"
3260,I.,this was work that made the sweat roll down his whole body. After an
3261,I.,"hour or two, he gave it up."
3262,I.,
3263,I.,"“I think I’ll look further for my fortune,” said he; “this is too hard"
3264,I.,work.”
3265,I.,
3266,I.,"“All right,” said the smith; “but maybe you’ll fare worse. You’ve"
3267,I.,"earned a little something, anyway;” and he drew aside his leather"
3268,I.,"apron, thrust his hand into his pocket, and brought out seven cents;"
3269,I.,"which Fred accepted with thanks, and resumed his journey."
3270,I.,
3271,I.,"His next encounter was with a farmer, who sat in the grassy corner"
3272,I.,"of a field, under the shade of a maple tree, eating his dinner. This"
3273,I.,"reminded Fred that it was noon, and that he was hungry."
3274,I.,
3275,I.,"“How d’e do, mister?” said Fred, looking through the rail-fence. “I"
3276,I.,should like to come over and take dinner with you.”
3277,I.,
3278,I.,"“You’ll have to furnish your own victuals,” said the farmer."
3279,I.,
3280,I.,"“That I can do,” said Fred, and climbed over the fence, and sat down by"
3281,I.,his new acquaintance.
3282,I.,
3283,I.,"“Where you bound for?” said the farmer, as Fred opened his bundle, and"
3284,I.,took out a sandwich.
3285,I.,
3286,I.,"“Going to seek my fortune,” said Fred."
3287,I.,
3288,I.,"“You don’t look like a runaway ’prentice,” said the farmer; “but that’s"
3289,I.,a curious answer to a civil question.”
3290,I.,
3291,I.,"“It’s true,” said Fred. “I _am_ going to seek my fortune.”"
3292,I.,
3293,I.,“Where do you expect to find it?”
3294,I.,
3295,I.,“I can’t tell--I suppose I must hunt for it.”
3296,I.,
3297,I.,"“Well, I can tell you where to look for it, if you’re in earnest; and"
3298,I.,"’tain’t so very far off, either,” said the farmer, as he raised the jug"
3299,I.,of milk to his mouth.
3300,I.,
3301,I.,"Fred indicated by his attitude that he was all attention, while the"
3302,I.,farmer took a long drink.
3303,I.,
3304,I.,"“In the ground,” said he, as he sat down the jug with one hand, and"
3305,I.,brushed the other across his mouth. “There’s no wealth but what comes
3306,I.,"out of the ground in some way. All the trees and plants, all the"
3307,I.,"grains, and grasses, and garden-sass, all the brick and stone, all"
3308,I.,"the metals--iron, gold, silver, copper--everything comes out of the"
3309,I.,"ground. That’s where man himself came from, according to the Bible:"
3310,I.,"‘Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.’ And the first primary"
3311,I.,"foundation of it all is agriculture. Hewson, the blacksmith, pretends"
3312,I.,to say it’s iron; and he maintained that side in the debating club at
3313,I.,"the last meeting. But I maintained it was agriculture, and I maintain"
3314,I.,"so still. Says I, ‘Mr. President, what’s your tailor, and your sailor,"
3315,I.,"and your ship-builder, and your soldier, and your blacksmith going to"
3316,I.,do without something to eat? [Here the farmer made a vigorous gesture
3317,I.,"by bringing down his fist upon his knee.] They can’t eat needles, nor"
3318,I.,"spikes, nor guns, nor anvils. The farmer’s got to feed ’em, every one"
3319,I.,on ’em. And they’ve got to have a good breakfast before they can do
3320,I.,"a good day’s work, and a dinner in the middle of it, and a supper at"
3321,I.,"the end of it. Can’t plow without iron?’ says I. ‘Why, Mr. President,"
3322,I.,in Syria and thereabouts they plow with a crooked limb of a tree to
3323,I.,"this day. The gentleman can see a picture of it in Barnes’s Notes, if"
3324,I.,"he has access to that valuable work.’ And says I, ‘Mr. President, who"
3325,I.,"was first in the order of time--Adam the farmer, or Tubal Cain the"
3326,I.,"blacksmith? No, sir; Adam was the precursor of Tubal Cain; Adam had to"
3327,I.,"be created before Tubal Cain could exist. First the farmer, and then"
3328,I.,"the blacksmith;--that, Mr. President, is the divine order in the great"
3329,I.,procession of creation.’”
3330,I.,
3331,I.,"Here the farmer stopped, and cut a piece of meat with his pocket-knife."
3332,I.,
3333,I.,"“Boy,” he continued, “if you want a fortune, you must dig it out of the"
3334,I.,ground. You won’t find one anywhere else.”
3335,I.,
3336,I.,Fred thought of his recent unpleasant experience in digging for a
3337,I.,"fortune, and asked, “Isn’t digging generally pretty hard work.”"
3338,I.,
3339,I.,"“Yes,” said the farmer, as he took up his hoe, and rose to his feet;"
3340,I.,“it _is_ hard work; but it’s a great deal more respectable than
3341,I.,"wandering around like a vagrant, picking up old horse-shoes, and"
3342,I.,hollering ‘Money!’ at falling stars.”
3343,I.,
3344,I.,Fred thought the man was somehow getting personal. So he took his
3345,I.,"bundle, climbed the fence, and said good-bye to him."
3346,I.,
3347,I.,"He walked on until he came to a fork of the road, and there he stopped,"
3348,I.,considering which road he would take. He could find no sign-board of
3349,I.,"any sort, and was about to toss one of his pennies to determine the"
3350,I.,"question, when he saw a white steeple at some distance down the right"
3351,I.,"hand road. “It’s always good luck to pass a church,” said he, and took"
3352,I.,that road.
3353,I.,
3354,I.,"When he reached the church, he sat down on the steps to rest. While"
3355,I.,"he sat there, thinking over all he had seen and heard that day, a"
3356,I.,"gentleman wearing a black coat, a high hat, and a white cravat, came"
3357,I.,"through the gate of a little house almost buried in vines and bushes,"
3358,I.,"that stood next to the church. He saw Fred, and approached him,"
3359,I.,"saying,--"
3360,I.,
3361,I.,"“Whither away, my little pilgrim?”"
3362,I.,
3363,I.,"“I am going to seek my fortune,” said Fred."
3364,I.,
3365,I.,“Haven’t you a home?”
3366,I.,
3367,I.,"“Yes, sir.”"
3368,I.,
3369,I.,“Parents?”
3370,I.,
3371,I.,"“Yes, sir.”"
3372,I.,
3373,I.,“Are they good to you?”
3374,I.,
3375,I.,"“O, yes, sir.”"
3376,I.,
3377,I.,"“Then you are fortunate already,” said the gentleman. “When I was at"
3378,I.,"your age, I had neither home nor parents, and the people where I lived"
3379,I.,were very unkind.”
3380,I.,
3381,I.,"“But my father isn’t rich,” said Fred; “and he never will be.”"
3382,I.,
3383,I.,“And you want to be rich?” said the gentleman.
3384,I.,
3385,I.,"“Yes, sir. I thought I’d try to be,” said Fred."
3386,I.,
3387,I.,“What for?”
3388,I.,
3389,I.,“What for? Why--why--so as to have the money.”
3390,I.,
3391,I.,"“And what would you do with the money, if you had it?”"
3392,I.,
3393,I.,"“I’d--I’d use it,” said Fred, beginning to feel that he had come to"
3394,I.,debating school without sufficiently understanding the question.
3395,I.,
3396,I.,“Do you see that pile of large stones near my barn?” said the
3397,I.,"gentleman. “I’ll give you those, and lend you a wheelbarrow to get them"
3398,I.,home.”
3399,I.,
3400,I.,"“I thank you,” said Fred; “but I don’t want them. They’re of no use.”"
3401,I.,
3402,I.,"“O, yes, they are! You can build a house with them,” said the gentleman."
3403,I.,
3404,I.,"“But I’m not ready to build a house,” said Fred. “I haven’t any land to"
3405,I.,"build it on, nor any other materials, nor anything to put into it; and"
3406,I.,I’m not old enough to be married and keep house.”
3407,I.,
3408,I.,"“Very true, my son! and if you had a cart-load of money now, it"
3409,I.,wouldn’t be of any more value to you than a cart-load of those building
3410,I.,"stones. But, after you have been to school a few years longer, and"
3411,I.,"trained yourself to some business, and made a man of yourself, and"
3412,I.,"developed your character, then you will have tastes, and capacities,"
3413,I.,"and duties that require money; and if you get it as you go along, and"
3414,I.,"always have enough to satisfy them, and none in excess to encumber you,"
3415,I.,that will be the happiest fortune you can find.”
3416,I.,
3417,I.,"Fred took a few minutes to think of it. Then he said,--"
3418,I.,
3419,I.,"“I believe you have told me the truth, and set me on the right track. I"
3420,I.,"will go home again, and try to make a man of myself first, and a rich"
3421,I.,man afterward.”
3422,I.,
3423,I.,"“Before you start, perhaps you would like to come into my house and get"
3424,I.,"rested, and look at some pictures.”"
3425,I.,
3426,I.,Fred accepted the invitation. The lady of the house gave him a
3427,I.,"delicious lunch, and he spent an hour in the clergyman’s study, looking"
3428,I.,"over two or three portfolios of prints and drawings, which they"
3429,I.,"explained to him. Then he bade them good-bye, shouldered his bundle,"
3430,I.,"and started for home, having the good fortune to catch a long ride, and"
3431,I.,arriving just as I did.
3432,I.,
3433,I.,"“What I’ve learned,” said he, as he finished his story, “is, that you"
3434,I.,can get rich if you don’t care for anything else; but you’ve either
3435,I.,"got to work yourself to death for it, or else cheat somebody. You can"
3436,I.,"get it out of the ground by working, or you can get it out of men by"
3437,I.,cheating. But who wants to do either? I don’t. And I believe it isn’t
3438,I.,"much use being rich, any way.”"
3439,I.,
3440,I.,"Then I told Fred my adventures. “And what I’ve learned,” said I, “is,"
3441,I.,"that you can get rich without much trouble, if you’re willing to wait"
3442,I.,all your life for forests to grow and property to rise. But what’s the
3443,I.,"use of money to an old man or an old woman that’s blind and deaf, and"
3444,I.,"just ready to die? Or what good does it do a mean man, with a lot of"
3445,I.,loafers round him? It can’t make him a gentleman.”
3446,I.,
3447,I.,"And meditating upon this newly-acquired philosophy, Fred and I went to"
3448,I.,our homes.
3449,I.,
3450,I.,"“Mother,” said I, “I’ve got back.”"
3451,I.,
3452,I.,"“Yes, my son, I expected you about this time.”"
3453,I.,
3454,I.,"“But I haven’t found a fortune, nor brought your camel’s-hair shawl.”"
3455,I.,
3456,I.,"“It’s just as well,” said she; “for I haven’t anything else that would"
3457,I.,be suitable to wear with it.”

3468,BY E. F.,
3469,BY E. F.,"Floris shut up her book, and looked at mamma. “Mamma, I wish we could"
3470,BY E. F.,be s’prised Christmas!”
3471,BY E. F.,
3472,BY E. F.,“Surprised.” It was a moment before mamma understood. “It is somewhat
3473,BY E. F.,"difficult,” she said then, “to surprise little girls who feel at"
3474,BY E. F.,"liberty to go to mamma’s drawers at any time, and to untie all the"
3475,BY E. F.,packages when the delivery-man comes. In a small house like this people
3476,BY E. F.,have to help surprise themselves.”
3477,BY E. F.,
3478,BY E. F.,“Who wants to help surprise theirselves!” exclaimed little Katy. “You
3479,BY E. F.,"ought to be cunning, mamma, and hide things; a ‘truly’ hide--you"
3480,BY E. F.,know--and not just in bureau drawers.”
3481,BY E. F.,
3482,BY E. F.,"“_That’s_ not what I mean at all, Katy,” said Floris. “Mamma, I mean"
3483,BY E. F.,"a _surprise_, and not our Christmas presents. Of course, Katy and I"
3484,BY E. F.,"know what them’ll be, or _most_ know. It’ll be our new hats, or some"
3485,BY E. F.,"aprons, or something we’d had to have any way, and just one of the"
3486,BY E. F.,"every-day Christmas presents besides; a book, or a horn of candy. I"
3487,BY E. F.,"most know mine’ll be a silver thimble this year, ’cause I lost my old"
3488,BY E. F.,"one, and I heard you tell papa that Katy’d better have a workbox, so’s"
3489,BY E. F.,"to s’courage her to learn sewing more. Now, see ’f ’tain’t so.”"
3490,BY E. F.,
3491,BY E. F.,"Mamma sat before her little daughters, her guilt confessed in her looks."
3492,BY E. F.,
3493,BY E. F.,"“Not that we blame you, mamma,” added Floris, kindly. “I’m old ’nough"
3494,BY E. F.,"now to know that if Santa Klaus brings us anything, he comes round"
3495,BY E. F.,"beforehand, and gets every cent they cost out of papa--great Santa"
3496,BY E. F.,"Klaus, that is!”"
3497,BY E. F.,
3498,BY E. F.,"“But what did you mean by a surprise, Floris?”"
3499,BY E. F.,
3500,BY E. F.,"“O, I d’no, quite,” answered Floris. “But I thought I sh’d like to have"
3501,BY E. F.,something happen that never had before; something planned for me ’n’
3502,BY E. F.,"Katy that we didn’t know a breath about, and there was no chance of"
3503,BY E. F.,"prying into, so that ’twould honestly s’prise us. I never was s’prised"
3504,BY E. F.,"in my life yet, mamma. I always found out some way.”"
3505,BY E. F.,
3506,BY E. F.,"Mrs. Dewey smiled. She went out to prepare dinner, and nothing more"
3507,BY E. F.,was said; and Miss Floris took up her book with a sigh.
3508,BY E. F.,
3509,BY E. F.,"But at night, while she was buttoning the two white night-dresses,"
3510,BY E. F.,"Mrs. Dewey returned to the subject. “My little daughters, if you will"
3511,BY E. F.,"keep out of the kitchen to-morrow, all day, I think I can promise that"
3512,BY E. F.,something very strange and delightful shall happen on Christmas.”
3513,BY E. F.,
3514,BY E. F.,"Four little feet jumped right up and down, two little faces flew up"
3515,BY E. F.,"in her own, four little hands caught hold of her, four bright eyes"
3516,BY E. F.,"transfixed her--indeed, they came pretty near having the secret right"
3517,BY E. F.,out of her on the spot.
3518,BY E. F.,
3519,BY E. F.,"“O, mamma! What _is_ it?”"
3520,BY E. F.,
3521,BY E. F.,"“You must be very anxious to be ‘truly s’prised,’” remarked mamma."
3522,BY E. F.,
3523,BY E. F.,Floris saw the point. She subsided at once. She smiled at mamma with
3524,BY E. F.,the first elder-daughter smile that had ever crossed the bright
3525,BY E. F.,child-face.
3526,BY E. F.,
3527,BY E. F.,"“I guess I _shall_ be ‘truly s’prised’ if we _are_ s’prised,” she said,"
3528,BY E. F.,"with a funny little grimace, as she laid her head on the pillow."
3529,BY E. F.,
3530,BY E. F.,"“Now, remember, it is to be a ‘truly keep-out,’” warned Mrs. Dewey."
3531,BY E. F.,“You are not to enter the kitchen at all--not once all day to-morrow.”
3532,BY E. F.,
3533,BY E. F.,"“Why, surely, mamma Dewey, you are not to do anything towa’ds it before"
3534,BY E. F.,"breakfast,” reasoned little Katy."
3535,BY E. F.,
3536,BY E. F.,“I shall at least notice whether I am obeyed.”
3537,BY E. F.,
3538,BY E. F.,“What’ll happen if we don’t?” inquired Katy.
3539,BY E. F.,
3540,BY E. F.,"“Nothing’ll happen then,” said mamma, quietly."
3541,BY E. F.,
3542,BY E. F.,"The little voices said no more, and mamma went down stairs. They said"
3543,BY E. F.,"not a single word more, because the little Deweys were so constructed"
3544,BY E. F.,that had there not been a standing command that they should not speak
3545,BY E. F.,"after mamma closed the door, their little pink tongues would have run"
3546,BY E. F.,"all night; but they squeezed each other’s hands very tightly, and also"
3547,BY E. F.,remained awake somewhat longer than usual.
3548,BY E. F.,
3549,BY E. F.,Mrs. Dewey smiled next morning to see her daughters seated at their
3550,BY E. F.,lessons in that part of the sitting-room furthest from the door
3551,BY E. F.,that opened into the hall and thus into the kitchen. They never
3552,BY E. F.,once directly referred to last night’s conversation; but they were
3553,BY E. F.,"extremely civil to her personally, most charmingly civil, obedient, and"
3554,BY E. F.,"thoughtful. Indeed, Katy’s little round shingled head would bob out"
3555,BY E. F.,into the hall almost every time mamma’s step was heard. “You must let
3556,BY E. F.,"me bring you anything I can, mamma--anything I can, ’thout going into"
3557,BY E. F.,"the kitchen, I mean.”"
3558,BY E. F.,
3559,BY E. F.,"But, to Katy’s disappointment, mamma wished no assistance. Floris"
3560,BY E. F.,"offered to go down town, if mamma needed. But mamma wished nothing that"
3561,BY E. F.,"Floris could do. However, to their delight, they saw the delivery-man,"
3562,BY E. F.,"when he came, taking down lots of orders in his book. “Would it be"
3563,BY E. F.,w’ong to listen in the hall?” Katy whispered. “’Cause I could hear
3564,BY E. F.,"everything she told him, ’f I was a-mind to.”"
3565,BY E. F.,
3566,BY E. F.,Floris told her it would be very wrong.
3567,BY E. F.,
3568,BY E. F.,"The elder little girl studied, and played, and sang, and amused her"
3569,BY E. F.,"doll all the morning, and refused to listen to any pleasant sound she"
3570,BY E. F.,"heard from the kitchen. She shut her little nose, also, against a"
3571,BY E. F.,sudden whiff of deliciousness as some door opened. She even went to the
3572,BY E. F.,"well, and brought hard water for her room, because the rain water would"
3573,BY E. F.,have taken her near the forbidden regions.
3574,BY E. F.,
3575,BY E. F.,But little Katy was as restless as a bee. She had a thousand errands
3576,BY E. F.,"through the hall. When Floris reprimanded her, she said she didn’t"
3577,BY E. F.,"’tend to go a-near the kitchen door. Floris looked out often; but, at"
3578,BY E. F.,"last, the little one settled on the hall stairs with her paint-box, and"
3579,BY E. F.,the elder sister felt at rest.
3580,BY E. F.,
3581,BY E. F.,But even to her it finally grew a long forenoon. Before ten o’clock she
3582,BY E. F.,found herself infected with the same restlessness. Then the various
3583,BY E. F.,"sounds which she heard distracted her, such busy sounds--she would, at"
3584,BY E. F.,"last, have given almost anything to know what was going on out there."
3585,BY E. F.,
3586,BY E. F.,"The mantel clock was just striking eleven when the hall door unclosed,"
3587,BY E. F.,and Katy’s plump little person partially appeared.
3588,BY E. F.,
3589,BY E. F.,"“Come here, quick, quick! or she’ll be back. _I’ve found out, Flory!_”"
3590,BY E. F.,
3591,BY E. F.,"“O, _have_ you--Why, Katy Dewey!” Floris over-turned the music-stool"
3592,BY E. F.,"as she ran. Katy, her head turned listeningly toward the kitchen door,"
3593,BY E. F.,blindly crowded a spoonful of something into her mouth.
3594,BY E. F.,
3595,BY E. F.,"“There! isn’t that ’licious good? O, Floris, such things as I have"
3596,BY E. F.,"seen out there!--the box of raisins is down on the table, and all her"
3597,BY E. F.,"extrach Lubin bottles. I couldn’t stay to look much; but, Floris,"
3598,BY E. F.,"there’s twelve of the most beautiful mince patties--O, the most"
3599,BY E. F.,"beautiful! all iced, and ‘Merry Christmas,’ in pink sand, on every one,"
3600,BY E. F.,and there’s twelve more in the iron ready to fill--_wasn’t_ that I gave
3601,BY E. F.,you _crammed_ with raisins!”
3602,BY E. F.,
3603,BY E. F.,"Floris’s eyes danced. “Kit Dewey, I’ll bet we’re going to have a"
3604,BY E. F.,"Christmas party--a party of little boys and girls! What else was there,"
3605,BY E. F.,do tell me!”
3606,BY E. F.,
3607,BY E. F.,"“O, I d’no; there was heaps of raisins--and, _mebbe_, there was ice"
3608,BY E. F.,cream;” suddenly remembering Floris’s fondness for that delectable.
3609,BY E. F.,
3610,BY E. F.,Floris knew better than that; but still her eyes danced. Suddenly they
3611,BY E. F.,"heard the back kitchen door, and, as suddenly, Floris turned white."
3612,BY E. F.,"“The mince-spoon, Katy! You’ve brought the mince-spoon! Mamma’ll know!”"
3613,BY E. F.,
3614,BY E. F.,Katy’s little mouth dropped open.
3615,BY E. F.,
3616,BY E. F.,“Quick! She’s coming this way!”
3617,BY E. F.,
3618,BY E. F.,"Floris softly got into the sitting-room, so did Katy."
3619,BY E. F.,
3620,BY E. F.,“Where is the spoon?” hurriedly whispered the elder girl.
3621,BY E. F.,
3622,BY E. F.,"“I stuffed it under the stair carpet, where that rod was up.”"
3623,BY E. F.,
3624,BY E. F.,They could hear mamma coming through the hall. But she came only part
3625,BY E. F.,"way. After a pause, she returned to the kitchen."
3626,BY E. F.,
3627,BY E. F.,"“Katy, what if she’s found it?”"
3628,BY E. F.,
3629,BY E. F.,“She couldn’t.”
3630,BY E. F.,
3631,BY E. F.,They stole out into the hall. The spoon was gone!
3632,BY E. F.,
3633,BY E. F.,"“O, Katy! I’ll bet you left it sticking out!” said Floris, and burst"
3634,BY E. F.,into tears. Katy did the same. With one accord they ascended the stairs
3635,BY E. F.,to their room.
3636,BY E. F.,
3637,BY E. F.,"When, with red eyes, they came down to dinner, they found mamma in"
3638,BY E. F.,the dining-room as placid as usual. The kitchen door was wide open.
3639,BY E. F.,After dinner Floris was requested to wipe the dishes. Her work took
3640,BY E. F.,"her into every part of the kitchen domains, and her red eyes peered"
3641,BY E. F.,about sharply; but nothing unusual was to be seen--not one trace of the
3642,BY E. F.,"beautiful patties, not a raisin-stem, even!"
3643,BY E. F.,
3644,BY E. F.,"Christmas day came and went. Floris had her silver thimble, and Katy"
3645,BY E. F.,her work-box. The dinner table was in the usual holiday trim. But
3646,BY E. F.,"the little frosted pies, with the pink greetings, were not brought"
3647,BY E. F.,"forward--no, and not one word was said concerning them, not even by"
3648,BY E. F.,mamma’s eyes.
3649,BY E. F.,
3650,BY E. F.,[Illustration]
3651,BY E. F.,
3652,BY E. F.,"At night they cried softly in their little white bed, after mamma had"
3653,BY E. F.,"gone down. “And, Floris, I ’member now, there was something else, under"
3654,BY E. F.,"a white cloth, like a plate of kisses, I thought,” sobbed Katy, her wet"
3655,BY E. F.,little face pressed into the pillows; “and I shall always think she was
3656,BY E. F.,"going to make fruitcake, for there was citron all cut up, and there was"
3657,BY E. F.,almonds--”
3658,BY E. F.,
3659,BY E. F.,"“Don’t, Katy! I don’t want to hear it! I _can’t_ hear it!” said"
3660,BY E. F.,"Floris, in a thick voice; “and don’t let us disobey mamma more by"
3661,BY E. F.,talking.”
3662,BY E. F.,
3663,BY E. F.,"But what did become of the beautiful, frosted, pink-lettered little"
3664,BY E. F.,pies--would you like to know?
3665,BY E. F.,
3666,BY E. F.,Floris and Katy cannot tell you; for never yet have mamma and her
3667,BY E. F.,little daughters exchanged a word upon the subject--but I think _I_
3668,BY E. F.,"can. At least I was told that a factory-weaver’s family, where there"
3669,BY E. F.,"were several little girls, had the most lovely of patties, and kisses,"
3670,BY E. F.,and sugar-plums sent them for their Christmas dinner last year.

3680,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Unless I take a long half mile circle, my daily walk to the post-office"

3683,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"_sauer-kraut_ and Limburg cheese, a restaurant steamy with Frenchy"

3687,BY ELLA FARMAN.,

3693,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3694,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Well, one morning I was going down town in the greatest hurry. I was"
3695,BY ELLA FARMAN.,trying to walk so fast that I needn’t breathe once going by the Dutch
3696,BY ELLA FARMAN.,groceries; and I was almost to the open space which looks away off to
3697,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the sparkling river, and the distant park, and the forenoon sun,--I"
3698,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"always take a good, long, sweet breath there, coming and going,--when"
3699,BY ELLA FARMAN.,my eye was caught by a remarkable group across the street.
3700,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3701,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Yes, during the night, evidently, while the town was asleep, there had"
3702,BY ELLA FARMAN.,been an arrival--strangers direct from the Sunny South.
3703,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3704,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"And there the remarkable-looking strangers sat, in a row, along the"
3705,BY ELLA FARMAN.,narrow step of one of the mysterious buildings I have alluded to. They
3706,BY ELLA FARMAN.,were sunning themselves with all the delightful carelessness of the
3707,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"experienced traveler. Though, evidently, they had been presented with"
3708,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the liberty of the city, it was just as evident that they didn’t care a"
3709,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"fig for sightseeing--not a fig, either, for the inhabitants. All they"
3710,BY ELLA FARMAN.,asked of our town was its sunshine. They had selected the spot where
3711,BY ELLA FARMAN.,they could get the most of it. Through the open space opposite the sun
3712,BY ELLA FARMAN.,streamed broadly; and the side of a weather-colored building is _so_
3713,BY ELLA FARMAN.,warm!
3714,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3715,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"What a picture of _dolce far niente_, of “sweet-do-nothing,” it was! I"
3716,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"stopped, hung my parasol over my shoulder,--there was a little too much"
3717,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sunshine for me,--and gazed at it."
3718,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3719,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“O, how you do love it! You bask like animals! That fullness of"
3720,BY ELLA FARMAN.,enjoyment is denied to us white-skins. What a visible absorption of
3721,BY ELLA FARMAN.,luster and heat! You are the true lotus-eaters!”
3722,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3723,BY ELLA FARMAN.,The umber-colored creatures--I suppose they are as much warmer for
3724,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"being brown, as any brown surface is warmer than a white one. I never"
3725,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"did see sunshine drank, and absorbed, and enjoyed as that was. It was a"
3726,BY ELLA FARMAN.,bit of Egypt and the Nile life. I could not bear to go on.
3727,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3728,BY ELLA FARMAN.,[Illustration]
3729,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3730,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Finally, I crossed the street to them. Not one of them stirred. The"
3731,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"eldest brother was standing, leaning against the building. He turned"
3732,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"one eye on me, and kept it there. At his feet lay a bulging, ragged"
3733,BY ELLA FARMAN.,satchel. Evidently he was the protector.
3734,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3735,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"The elder sister, with hands tucked snugly under her folded arms,"
3736,BY ELLA FARMAN.,winked and blinked at me dozily. The little boy with the Nubian lips
3737,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"was sound asleep,--a baby Osiris,--his chubby hands hiding together"
3738,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"between his knees for greater warmth. The youngest sister, wrapped in"
3739,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"an old woolen shawl, was the only uncomfortable one of the lot. There"
3740,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"was no doze nor dream in her eyes yet--poor thing, _she_ was cold!"
3741,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3742,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I didn’t believe they had had anywhere to lay their heads during the
3743,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"night. Liberty of a city, to one kind of new arrivals, means just"
3744,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"that, you know. Sundry crumbs indicated an absence of the conventional"
3745,BY ELLA FARMAN.,breakfast table. Poor little darkies!
3746,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3747,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Children,” I said, like a benevolently-disposed city marshal, “you"

3752,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“I ’low we ain’t, Jim!” The big sister said this without any diminution"

3755,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“It’s powerful cold comin’ up fru the norf, mistis. I _mus’_ let ’em"

3758,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Up through the north! Pray, where are you going?”"

3762,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“I ex-pect, I ex-pect--”"
3763,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3764,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“You _spec_, Jim! You allers spectin’! Mistis, we’s _free_--we kin go"
3765,BY ELLA FARMAN.,anywhars!”
3766,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3767,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I suspect there had been a great deal of long-suffering on the part of
3768,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Jim. He burst out like flame from a smoldering fire,--"
3769,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3770,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“_Anywhars!_ That’s what ails niggas! Freedom means _anywhars_ to ’em,"
3771,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and so they’re nuffin’ nor nobody. You vagabon’, Rose Moncton, you"
3772,BY ELLA FARMAN.,_kin’t_ go anywhars much longer--not ’long o’ me!”
3773,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3774,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“O, you white folksy Jim! I ’low this trompin’ was yer own plan. When"
3775,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"you finds a town whar it’s any show of warm, I’ll hang up my things"
3776,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and stay, and not afore--ye hyar that! I ’low I won’t see Peyty and Kit"
3777,BY ELLA FARMAN.,a-freezin’!”
3778,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3779,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"She scowled at me, she actually did, as if I froze her with my pale"
3780,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"face and cool leaf-green dress, and kept the sun off her, talking with"
3781,BY ELLA FARMAN.,that “white folksy Jim.”
3782,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3783,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I fancied Jim was hoping I would say something more to them. I fancied
3784,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"he, at least, was in great need of a friend’s advice."
3785,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3786,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“Where did you come from?” I asked him. But the other head of the
3787,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"family answered,--"
3788,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3789,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“Come from nuff sight warmer place than we’s goin’ anywhars.”
3790,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3791,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Rose is allers techy when she’s cold, mistis,” Jim apologized. “Ole"
3792,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Maum Phillis used fer to say as Rose’s temper goose-pimpled when the
3793,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cold air struck it. We kim from Charleston, mistis. We’s speckin’ to"
3794,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"work out some land for ourselves, and hev a home. We kim up norf to git"
3795,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"wages, so as we kin all help at it. I’d like to stop hyar, mistis.”"
3796,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3797,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Hyar! I ’low we’s goin’ soufard when we gits from dis yer, you Jim,”"
3798,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sniffed “Rose Moncton,” her face up to the sunshine."
3799,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3800,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Poor Jim looked care-worn. I dare say my face was tolerably
3801,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sympathetic. It felt so, at least."
3802,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3803,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Mistis,” the fellow said, “she’s kep us tackin’ souf an’ norf, souf"
3804,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"an’ norf, all dis yer week, or we’d been somewhars. She don’t like de"
3805,BY ELLA FARMAN.,looks of no town _yet_. We’s slep’ roun’ in sheds six weeks now. I gits
3806,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sawin’ an’ choppin’, an’ sich, to do once a day, while dey warms up in"
3807,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"de sun, an’ eats a bite. Den up we gits, an’ tromps on. We’s got on so"
3808,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"fur, but Rose ain’t clar at all yit whar we’ll stop. Mistis, whar is de"
3809,BY ELLA FARMAN.,warmest place _you_ knows on?”
3810,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3811,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I thought better and better of myself as the heavy-faced fellow thus
3812,BY ELLA FARMAN.,appealed to me. I felt flattered by his confidence in me. I always feel
3813,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"flattered when a strange kitty follows me, or the birdies hop near for"
3814,BY ELLA FARMAN.,my crumbs. But I will confess that no human vagabond had ever before so
3815,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"skillfully touched the soft place in my heart. Poor, dusky wanderer!"
3816,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"he looked so hungry, he looked so worn-out, too, as a head of a family"
3817,BY ELLA FARMAN.,will when the other head pulls the other way.
3818,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3819,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Well, Jim, the warmest place I know of is in my kitchen. I left a"
3820,BY ELLA FARMAN.,rousing fire there ten minutes ago. You all stay here until I come
3821,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"back, which will be in about seven minutes; then you shall go home"
3822,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"with me, and I will give you a good hot dinner. You may stay all"
3823,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"night, if you like, and perhaps I can advise you. You will be rested,"
3824,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"at the least, for a fresh start.”"
3825,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3826,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Rose Moncton lifted her listless head, and looked in my face. “Laws!”"
3827,BY ELLA FARMAN.,said she. “Laws!” said she again.
3828,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3829,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Jim pulled his forelock to me, vailed the flash in his warm umbery eyes"
3830,BY ELLA FARMAN.,with a timely wink of the heavy lids. He composed himself at once into
3831,BY ELLA FARMAN.,a waiting attitude.
3832,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3833,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I heard another “Laws!” as I hastened away. “That young mistis is done
3834,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"crazy. She’ll nebber kim back hyar, ’pend on dat!” Such was Rose’s"
3835,BY ELLA FARMAN.,opinion of me.
3836,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3837,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I opened my ears for Jim’s. But Jim made no reply.
3838,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3839,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Father and mother had gone out of town for two days. Our hired girl had
3840,BY ELLA FARMAN.,left. I really was “mistis” of the premises. If I chose to gather in a
3841,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"circle of shivering little “niggas” around my kitchen stove, and heat"
3842,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"that stove red-hot, there was nobody to say I better not."
3843,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3844,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"I was back in five minutes, instead of seven. Jim stood straight up on"
3845,BY ELLA FARMAN.,his feet the moment he discovered me coming. Rose showed some faint
3846,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"signs of life and interest. “’Clar, now, mistis! Kim along, den, Jim,"
3847,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and see ye look to that there verlise. Hyar, you Kit!” She managed to"
3848,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"rouse her sister with her foot, still keeping her hands warmly hidden,"
3849,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and her face to the sun.
3850,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3851,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But the other head took the little ones actively in charge. “Come,"
3852,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Peyty, boy! come, Kit! we’s gwine now!”"
3853,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3854,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Peyty opened his eyes--how starry they were! “O, we goin’, mo’? Jim, I"
3855,BY ELLA FARMAN.,don’t want to go no mo’!”
3856,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3857,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Ain’t gwine clar thar no, Peyty, boy; come, Kit--only to a house to"
3858,BY ELLA FARMAN.,warm the Peyty boy--come Kit!”
3859,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3860,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Kit was coming fast enough. But Peyty had to be taken by the arm and
3861,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"pulled up. Then he stepped slowly, the tears coming. The movement"
3862,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"revealed great swollen welts, where his stiff, tattered, leathern shoes"
3863,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"had chafed and worn into the fat, black little legs. “Is dat ar Mistis"
3864,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Nelly?” he asked, opening his eyes, wonderingly, at the white lady."
3865,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3866,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Rose had got up now. A sudden quiver ran over her face. “No, Peyty."
3867,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Mist’ Nelly’s dead, you know. Wish we’s back to Mas’r Moncton’s, and"
3868,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Mist’ Nelly libbin’, an’ Linkum sojers dead afore dey cum!”"
3869,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3870,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"There was a long sigh from everybody, even from Jim. But he drew in his"
3871,BY ELLA FARMAN.,lips tightly the next moment. “Some niggas nebber was worf freein’.
3872,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Come along, Peyty, boy--ready, mistis.”"
3873,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3874,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I walked slowly along at the head of the strangers from the south.
3875,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Little feet were so sore, Peyty couldn’t walk fast. Kit’s big woman’s"
3876,BY ELLA FARMAN.,size shoes were so stiff she could only shuffle along. Jim’s toes were
3877,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"protruding, and I fancied he and Rose were as foot-sore as the little"
3878,BY ELLA FARMAN.,ones. I dare say people looked and wondered; but I am not ashamed to be
3879,BY ELLA FARMAN.,seen with any kind of children.
3880,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3881,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"I took them around to the back door, into the kitchen, which I had"
3882,BY ELLA FARMAN.,found unendurable while baking my bread and pies. The heated air rushed
3883,BY ELLA FARMAN.,out against my face as I opened the door. It was a delicious May-day;
3884,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"but the procession behind me, entering, proceeded direct to the stove,"
3885,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and surrounded it in winter fashion, holding their hands out to the"
3886,BY ELLA FARMAN.,heat. Even from Jim I heard a soft sigh of satisfaction.
3887,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3888,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Poor, shivering children of the tropics! I drew up the shades. There"
3889,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"were no outer blinds, and the sun streamed in freely."
3890,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3891,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“There, now. Warm yourselves, and take your own time for it. Put in"
3892,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"wood, Jim, and keep as much fire as you like. I am going to my room to"
3893,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"rest for an hour. Be sure that you don’t go off, for I wish you to stay"
3894,BY ELLA FARMAN.,here until you are thoroughly rested. I have plenty of wood for you to
3895,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"saw, Jim.”"
3896,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3897,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"I brought out a pan of cookies. I set them on the table. “Here, Rose,"
3898,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"see that Peyty and Kit have all they want. When I come down, I’ll get"
3899,BY ELLA FARMAN.,you some dinner.”
3900,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3901,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"The poor children in stories, and in real life, too, for that matter,"
3902,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"always get only bread and butter--dear me, poor dears! When I undertake"
3903,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"a romance for these waifs in real life, or story, I always give them"
3904,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cookies--cookies, sweet, golden, and crusty, with sifted sugar."
3905,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3906,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"I left them all, even to Jim, looking over into the pan. My! rich,"
3907,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sugary jumbles, and plummy queen’s cakes? When I saw their eyes"
3908,BY ELLA FARMAN.,dance--no sleep in those eyes now--I was glad it wasn’t simply
3909,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"wholesome sandwiches and plain fried cakes, as somebody at my elbow"
3910,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"says now it ought to have been. I would have set out a picnic table,"
3911,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"with ice-cream and candies, for those wretched little “niggas,” if I"
3912,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"could! I nodded to them, and went away. It is so nice, after you have"
3913,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"made a child happy, to add some unmistakable sign that it is quite"
3914,BY ELLA FARMAN.,welcome to the happiness!
3915,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3916,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I knew there was nothing which they could steal. I expected they
3917,BY ELLA FARMAN.,would explore the pantry. I judged them by some of my little white
3918,BY ELLA FARMAN.,friends. But the silver was locked up. China and glass would hardly be
3919,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"available. If, after they had stuffed themselves with those cookies,"
3920,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"they could want cold meat, and bread and butter, I surely shouldn’t"
3921,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"begrudge it. Then I thought of my own especial lemon tart, which stood"
3922,BY ELLA FARMAN.,cooling on the shelf before the window; but I was not going back to
3923,BY ELLA FARMAN.,insult that manly Jim Moncton by removing it.
3924,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3925,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Just as I was slipping on my dressing-gown up in my own cool, quiet"
3926,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"chamber, I caught a faint sound of the outside door of the kitchen."
3927,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Something like a shriek, or a scream, followed. Then there was an"
3928,BY ELLA FARMAN.,unmistakable and mighty overturning of chairs. I rushed down. At the
3929,BY ELLA FARMAN.,very least I expected to see my romantic “Rose Moncton” with her hands
3930,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"clenched in brother Jim’s kinky hair. With loosened tresses, without"
3931,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"belt or collar, I appeared on the scene."
3932,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3933,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"What did I see? Why, I saw Phillis, Mrs. Jack Graham’s black cook, with"
3934,BY ELLA FARMAN.,every one of my little “niggas” in her arms--heads of the family and
3935,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"all! There they were, sobbing and laughing together, the portly Phillis"
3936,BY ELLA FARMAN.,the loudest of the whole. One of Mrs. Jack’s favorite china bowls lay
3937,BY ELLA FARMAN.,in fragments on the floor.
3938,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3939,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Phillis called out hysterically as she saw me. Jim discovered me the
3940,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"same moment. He detached himself, went up to the window, and bowed his"
3941,BY ELLA FARMAN.,head down upon the sash. I saw the tears roll down his cheek and drop.
3942,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3943,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Laws, Miss Carry! dese my ole mas’r’s niggers! dey’s Mas’r Moncton’s"
3944,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"little nigs, ebery one! dey’s runned roun’ under my feet in Mas’r"
3945,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Moncton’s kitchen many a day down in ole Carline--bress em souls!” She
3946,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"hugged them again, and sobbed afresh, The children clung to the old"
3947,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cook’s neck, and waist, and arms like so many helpless, frightened"
3948,BY ELLA FARMAN.,black kittens.
3949,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3950,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Phillis at last recovered her dignity. She pointed them to their
3951,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"chairs. She picked up the pieces of china in her apron. “Done gone,"
3952,BY ELLA FARMAN.,anyhow--dese pickaninnies gib ole Phillis sich a turn! It mose like
3953,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"seein’ Mas’r Moncton an’ Miss Nelly demselves. Whar you git ’em, Miss"
3954,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Carry?”
3955,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3956,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I told her.
3957,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3958,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Bress your heart, Miss Carry! Len’ me a cup, and git me some yeast,"
3959,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and I’ll bring Mistis Graham ober, an’ I’ll be boun’, when she sees dat"
3960,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ar lubly little Peyty, she’ll hire him to--to--to--lor! she’ll hire him"
3961,BY ELLA FARMAN.,to look into his diamint eyes.”
3962,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3963,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I know she herself kissed tears out of more than one pair of “diamint
3964,BY ELLA FARMAN.,eyes” while I was getting the yeast. I heard her.
3965,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3966,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“O, Maum Phillis!” I heard Jim say. “You think we’ll hire out roun’"
3967,BY ELLA FARMAN.,hyar?”
3968,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3969,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“_Could_ we, Maum Phillis?” pleaded Rose, her voice soft and warm now."
3970,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“We’s done tired out. I’m clean ready to drop down in my tracks long
3971,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"this yer blessed stove, and nebber stir anywhars!”"
3972,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3973,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Bress you, chilluns! You _hev_ tromped like sojers, clar from"
3974,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ole Carline! Spec it seems like home, findin’ one of de old place"
3975,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"hands--Phillis knows. Dar, dar! don’t take on so. Miss Carry, she’ll"
3976,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"bunk you down somewhar it’s warm, and thar you stay an’ rest dem feet."
3977,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"I’ll send my mistis ober, and dey two’ll pervide fer ye on dis yer"
3978,BY ELLA FARMAN.,street; dis yer one ob de Lord’s own streets.”
3979,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3980,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Well, do you think Mistis Graham and Mistis Carry dishonored Maum"
3981,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Phillis’s faith in them?
3982,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3983,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"No, indeed! The family found homes on “de Lord’s own street.” Jam is"
3984,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"coachman at Squire Lee’s. Peyty is at the same place, taken in at first"
3985,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"for his sweet disposition, and “diamint eyes,” I suspect. He is now a"
3986,BY ELLA FARMAN.,favorite table-waiter.
3987,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3988,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Kit is Maum Phillis’s right-hand woman. Rose is our own hired girl. She
3989,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"is somewhat given to sleepiness, and to idling in sunny windows, and to"
3990,BY ELLA FARMAN.,scorching her shoes and aprons against the stove of a winter’s evening.
3991,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But, on the whole, she is a good servant; and we have built her a"
3992,BY ELLA FARMAN.,bedroom out of the kitchen.
3993,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
3994,BY ELLA FARMAN.,I have never regretted crossing the street to speak to the strangers

4126,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4127,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4128,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"How artful the wind was that cold March morning, hiding away every now"
4129,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and then, pretending to be quite gone, only to rush out with a fearful"
4130,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,howl at such unexpected moments that Carl was nearly blown off his feet
4131,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,each time.
4132,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4133,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"But he struggled bravely forward, bending his head to the blast,"
4134,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and holding his brimless hat on with one hand, while he carried his"
4135,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,battered tin pail in the other.
4136,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4137,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,There was not a gleam of fire in the wretched room he had just left;
4138,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and Tony and Lena, his little sisters, wrapped in the old piece of"
4139,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"carpet that served them for a blanket, were _almost_ crying with hunger"
4140,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,and with cold.
4141,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4142,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"They would have cried outright if Carl had not kissed them, and said,"
4143,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Never mind, young uns--wait till I can give you each a reg’lar bang-up"
4144,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"lace hankercher to cry on,--_then_ you may cry as much as you please.”"
4145,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4146,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Father and mother had died within a week of each other, when February’s"
4147,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"snows were upon the ground, leaving these three poor children without"
4148,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,money and without friends--a bad way for even grown-ups to be left.
4149,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4150,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"So Carl, poor boy, found himself, at ten years of age, the head of a"
4151,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,family.
4152,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4153,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,Of course he became a newsboy.
4154,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4155,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Almost all heads of families ten years and under, become newsboys."
4156,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4157,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,Twenty-five cents given him by an old woman who sold apples and
4158,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"peanuts, and who, by the way, was not much better off than he was"
4159,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"himself, started him in business."
4160,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4161,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"But the business, I am sorry to say, scarcely paid the rent, leaving"
4162,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"nothing for clothing, food and fire, three very necessary things,--be a"
4163,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,home ever so humble.
4164,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4165,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"So every morning, almost as soon as the day dawned--and I can tell"
4166,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,you day dawns very quickly in a room where the window hasn’t a scrap
4167,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,of shade or curtain--before he went down town for his stock of morning
4168,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"papers, Carl started out to bring home the family fuel."
4169,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4170,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,This consisted of whatever sticks and bits of wood he could find lying
4171,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"about the streets, and whatever cinders and pieces of coal he could"
4172,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,pick from the ash-barrels and boxes.
4173,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4174,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"If the weather was at all mild, Tony, the eldest sister, and the"
4175,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"housekeeper, went with him, and helped him fill the old pail."
4176,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4177,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"She carried a forlorn-looking basket, that seemed ashamed of the old"
4178,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"piece of rope that served for its handle, and stopped on her way home"
4179,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"at several houses, where the servant girls had taken a fancy to the"
4180,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"gray-eyed, shy little thing, to get the family marketing."
4181,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4182,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"But alas! very _very_ often the supply fell far short of the demand,"
4183,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"for the winter had been a very severe one, and everybody had such a"
4184,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"number of calls from all sorts of needy people, that they could afford"
4185,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,to give but little to each one.
4186,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4187,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"This particular March morning Carl went out alone, wondering as he went"
4188,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,when “the fortune” was going to “turn up.”
4189,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4190,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"For these poor children, shut out from dolls, fairy-books, and all"
4191,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"things that make childhood merry and bright, used to while away many an"
4192,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"hour, talking of “a fortune” which the brother had prophesied would one"
4193,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,day be found in the ashes.
4194,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4195,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,At different times this dream took different shapes.
4196,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4197,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Sometimes it was a pocket-book, oh! so fat with greenbacks, sometimes"
4198,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"a purse of gold, sometimes “a diamint ring:” but, whatever it should"
4199,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"prove to be, Carl was convinced, “felt it in his bones,” he said, it"
4200,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"_would_ be found, and found hidden among the cinders."
4201,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4202,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Once he had brought home a silver fork, “scooped,” as he called it in"
4203,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"newsboy’s slang, from an ash-heap in an open lot."
4204,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4205,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,On this fork the family had lived for three days.
4206,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4207,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Once he rescued a doll, which _would_ have been _lovely_ if it had"
4208,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"had a head; and at various times there were scraps of ribbon, lace"
4209,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and silk, all of which served to strengthen the belief that something"
4210,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,wonderful must “turn up” at last.
4211,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4212,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Cricky! how that old wind does holler,” said Carl to himself, as he"
4213,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"toiled along, “an’ it cuts right through me, my jacket’s so thin an’"
4214,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"torn--I’d mend it myself if I only knew how, and somebody’d lend me a"
4215,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,needle and thread.
4216,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4217,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“Don’t I wish I’d find the fortune this morning!
4218,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4219,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“I dreamt of it last night--dreamt it was a bar of gold, long as my"
4220,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"arm, and precious thick, too."
4221,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4222,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“Guess I’ll go to that big bar’l afore them orful high flat
4223,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,houses--that’s _allus_ full of cinders.
4224,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4225,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“It’s lucky for us them big bugs don’t sift their ashes! _We_ wouldn’t
4226,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"have no fire if they did,--that’s what’s the matter.”"
4227,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4228,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"So he made his way to the “big bar’l,” hoping no one had been there"
4229,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"before him, and, leaning over without looking, put his cold, red hand"
4230,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"into the ashes, but he drew it out again in a hurry, for, cold as _it_"
4231,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"was, it had touched something colder."
4232,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4233,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Hello!” cried Carl, “what’s that? It don’t feel ’zactly like the bar"
4234,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"of gold,” and, dropping on his knees, he peeped in."
4235,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4236,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"A dirty little, shaggy, once-white dog raised a pair of soft, dark,"
4237,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,wistful eyes to his face.
4238,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4239,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Why! I’m blessed,” said Carl, in great surprise, “if it ain’t a dog."
4240,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Poor little beggar! that was his nose I felt, an’ wasn’t it cold?”"
4241,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4242,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“I s’pose he’s got in among the ashes to keep warm; wot pooty eyes
4243,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"he’s got, just like that woman’s wot give me a ten cent stamp for the"
4244,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"_Tribune_ the other day, and wouldn’t take no change. Poor old feller!"
4245,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,Are you lost?”
4246,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4247,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"The dog had risen to its feet, and still looking pleadingly at Carl,"
4248,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,commenced wagging its tail in a friendly manner.
4249,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4250,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Oh! you want me to take you home,” continued Carl. “I can’t ’cause"
4251,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"I dunno where you live, and _my_ family eats all they can git"
4252,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"theirselves--they’re awful pigs, they are,” and he laughed softly, “an’"
4253,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,couldn’t board a dog nohow.”
4254,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4255,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"But the dog kept on wagging his tail, and as soon as Carl ceased"
4256,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"speaking, as though grateful for even a few kind words, it licked the"
4257,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,cold hand that rested on the side of the barrel.
4258,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4259,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,That dog--kiss won the poor boy’s heart completely. “You _shall_
4260,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"go with me,” he cried impulsively. “Jest come out of that barrel"
4261,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"till I fill this pail with cinders, and then we’ll be off. He kin"
4262,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"have the bones _we_ can’t crack with our teeth ennyhow,” he said to"
4263,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"himself,--not a very cheerful prospect, it must be confessed, for the"
4264,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,boarder.
4265,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4266,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"The dog, as though he understood every word, jumped from the box, and"
4267,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,seated himself on the icy pavement to wait for his new landlord and
4268,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,master.
4269,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4270,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"In a few moments the pail was full, and the boy turned toward his home,"
4271,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"running as fast as he could, with the dog trotting along by his side."
4272,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4273,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“See wot I foun’ in the ashes,” he cried, bounding into the room."
4274,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“Here’s the fortune alive an’ kickin’. Wot you think of it?”
4275,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4276,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Oh, wot a funny fortune!” said Tony, and “Wot a funny fortune!”"
4277,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,repeated little Lena.
4278,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4279,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“It’s kinder queer,--the pocket-book an’ the dimint ring a-turnin’ into"
4280,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"a dog!” Tony continued. “But no matter, if we can’t buy nothin’ with"
4281,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"him, we can love him, poor little feller!”"
4282,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4283,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“Poor ’ittle feller!” repeated Lina. “He nicer than dollie ’ithout a
4284,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"head, ennyhow. _We_ can lub him.”"
4285,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4286,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“An’ now, Carl,” said the housekeeper, “you make the fire, an’ I’ll run"
4287,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"to market, for it’s most time you went after your papers.”"
4288,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4289,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"And away she sped, to return in a few minutes with five or six cold"
4290,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"potatoes, a few crusts of bread, and one bone, with very little"
4291,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,meat--and that gristle--clinging to it.
4292,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4293,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,And this bone--think if you can of a greater act of self-denial and
4294,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,charity--the children decided with one accord should be given to
4295,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Cinders,” as they had named the dog on the spot."
4296,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4297,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"That night, after Carl had sold his papers, and come home tired but"
4298,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"hopeful, for he had made thirty cents clear profit to save toward the"
4299,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"rent, they all huddled together, with doggie in the midst of them,"
4300,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,around the old iron furnace that held their tiny fire.
4301,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4302,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Presently the Head of the Family began whistling a merry tune, which"
4303,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,was a great favorite with the newsboys.
4304,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4305,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,Imagine the astonishment of the children when Cinders pricked up his
4306,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"ears, rose on his hind legs, and, after gravely walking across the room"
4307,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"once, began to walk round and round, keeping perfect time to the music!"
4308,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4309,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Hurrah! hurrah!” shouted Carl, his eyes sparkling. “Look at that! look"
4310,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"at that! Tony, it _’tis_ the fortune after all! an’ I _did_ find it in"
4311,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,the ash-box!”
4312,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4313,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Why, wot do you mean, Bub?” cried Tony, almost as excited as her"
4314,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"brother. “Wot do you mean, an’ ware’s ‘the fortune?’”"
4315,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4316,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Why there, right afore your eyes. I mean Cinders is one o’ them orful"
4317,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,smart hundred-dollar dogs wot does tricks. He’s bin lost by that circus
4318,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"wot went away night afore last, an’ he’s bin lost a-purpose to make my"
4319,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"dreams come true! I’ll take him out the fust fine day, an’ we’ll bring"
4320,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,home lots of stamps. You see if we don’t!”
4321,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4322,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“_I’ll_ sell the papers,” said Tony, by this time _quite_ as excited as"
4323,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"her brother; “I kin do it, Carl. ‘’Ere’s the mornin’ Herald, Sun, Times"
4324,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"an’ _Tri_-bune!’” imitating the shrill cry of the newsboy, and doing"
4325,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"it very well, too, “an’ the fellers’ll be good to me, ’cos I’m your"
4326,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"sister, an’ they like you.”"
4327,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4328,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“You’re a brick, Tony!” said Carl, “an’ for sich a small brick the"
4329,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,brickiest brick I ever knowed; but I kin sell ’em myself in the
4330,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"mornin’, an’ you kin take ’em in the afternoon, for that’s the"
4331,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,time Cinders an’ me must perform. ‘Monseer Carlosky an’ his werry
4332,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"talented dog Cinders, son of the well-known French performing poodle"
4333,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Cinderella.’ How’s that, Tony? O I’ve read all about ’em on the circus"
4334,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"bills, and that’s the way they do it. Yes, you’ll have to take the"
4335,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"papers in the afternoon, cos then’s when the swell boys an’ gals is"
4336,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"home from school,--’cept Saturdays, then we’ll be out most all day.”"
4337,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4338,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Dance more, Tinders, dance more!” here broke in little Lena; but"
4339,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Cinders stood looking at his master, evidently waiting for the music."
4340,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4341,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,So Carl commenced whistling--did I tell you he whistled like a
4342,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"bird?--and Cinders once more marched gravely across the room, and then"
4343,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,began waltzing again in the most comical manner.
4344,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4345,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,He had evidently been trained to perform his tricks just twice; for
4346,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"when the music ceased _this_ time he proceeded to stand on his head,"
4347,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and then sitting up on his hind legs, he nodded politely to the"
4348,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"audience, and held out one of his paws, as much as to say, “Now pay if"
4349,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,you please.”
4350,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4351,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"The poor children forgot hunger and cold in their delight, and that"
4352,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"miserable room resounded to more innocent, merry laughter that night"
4353,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"than it had heard for many long years, perhaps ever before."
4354,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4355,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,Cinders got another bone for his supper--the others had nothing--and
4356,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"then they all went to bed, if lying on the bare floor, with nothing for"
4357,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"a pillow can be called going to bed, and dreamed of “the fortune” found"
4358,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,at last in the ashes.
4359,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4360,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"The next afternoon, which fortunately was a fine one, for March having"
4361,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“come in like a lion was preparing to go out like a lamb,” Carl came"
4362,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"racing up the crazy stairs, taking two steps at a time, and, tossing a"
4363,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"bundle of evening papers to Tony, he whistled to Cinders, and away they"
4364,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,went.
4365,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4366,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Poor Carl looked shabby enough, with his toes sticking out of a pair of"
4367,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,old shoes--a part of the treasures “scooped” from the ash-heap--and not
4368,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"mates at that, one being as much too large as the other was too small,"
4369,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,his tattered jacket and his brimless hat.
4370,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4371,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,But Cinders followed him as faithfully as though he had been clad in a
4372,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,costly suit of the very latest style.
4373,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4374,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Turning into a handsome, quiet street, Carl stopped at last before"
4375,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,a house where three or four rosy-cheeked children were flattening
4376,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"their noses against the panes of the parlor windows, trying to see a"
4377,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,doll which another rosy-cheeked child was holding up at a window just
4378,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,opposite.
4379,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4380,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Now Cinders, ole feller!” said Carl, while his heart beat fast, “do"
4381,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,your best. BONES!” and he began to whistle.
4382,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4383,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"At the first note Cinders stood up on his hind legs, at the second he"
4384,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,took his first step forward.
4385,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4386,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,At the beginning of the fourth bar the waltz began; and by this time
4387,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,the rosy-cheeked children had lost all interest in the doll over the
4388,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"way, and were all shouting and calling “Mamma!” and the cook and"
4389,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,chambermaid had made their appearance at the area gate.
4390,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4391,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"The march and waltz having been gone through with twice, Cinders"
4392,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"stood on his head--“shure,” said the cook, “I couldn’t do it betther"
4393,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"myself”--tumbled quickly to his feet again, nodded affably once to the"
4394,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"right, once to the left, and once to the front of him, and held out his"
4395,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,right paw.
4396,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4397,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“He’s the cliverest baste ever _I_ seen,” said the chambermaid, “so"
4398,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"he is!” and she threw a five cent piece in Carl’s old hat; and, at"
4399,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"the same moment the window was opened, and out flew a perfect shower"
4400,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"of pennies, while the little girl across the way kept shouting, “Come"
4401,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"here, ragged little boy! Come here, funny doggie! Oh, _why_ don’t you"
4402,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,come here?”
4403,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4404,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"And, making his best bow to his first audience, Carl went over to the"
4405,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"doll’s house, and was received by the whole family, including grandpa"
4406,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"and grandma, with great delight and laughter, and was rewarded at the"
4407,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"end of his entertainment with much applause, three oranges, and a new"
4408,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,ten cent stamp.
4409,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4410,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,That afternoon Cinders earned one dollar and three cents for his
4411,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,little master; and I can’t describe to you the joy that reigned in
4412,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"that small bare room when Carl, in honor of his debut as “Monseer"
4413,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Carlosky” brought in, and spread out on a newspaper on the floor, a"
4414,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"wonderful feast! Real loaf of bread, bought at the baker’s, bottle"
4415,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"of sarsaparilla at the grocer’s, and peanuts, apples, and a hunk of"
4416,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,some extraordinary candy from the old woman who kept a stand at the
4417,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"corner, and who had started Carl as a newsboy. She also received her"
4418,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"twenty-five cents again, with five cents added by way of interest."
4419,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4420,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"“Why! didn’t they look when they see me a-orderin’ things, and payin’"
4421,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"for ’em on the spot!” said “Monseer,” with honest pride, as he carved"
4422,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,the loaf with an old jackknife.
4423,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4424,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"As for Cinders, no meatless bone, but half a pound of delicious liver,"
4425,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"did that remarkable dog receive, and more kisses on his cold, black"
4426,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,nose than he knew what to do with.
4427,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4428,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"After that, as the weather grew finer and finer, and the days longer,"
4429,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Carl and his dog wandered farther and farther, and earned more and"
4430,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"more money every day, until the little sisters rejoiced in new shoes,"
4431,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"hats and dresses, and the housekeeper had a splendid basket--not very"
4432,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"large, of course--with a handle that any basket could be proud of, and"
4433,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"actually _did_ go to market, fair and square, and no make believe about"
4434,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,it.
4435,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4436,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"And Carl presented himself with a brand-new suit of clothes, from the"
4437,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"second-hand shop next door, including shoes that were made for each"
4438,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"other, and a hat with a brim."
4439,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4440,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,By-and-by the cheerless room was exchanged for a pleasanter one; and
4441,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"the story of the fair-haired Head of the Family, and the fortune"
4442,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"he found in the ashes, took wings, and returned to him laden with"
4443,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,blessings.
4444,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4445,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"And five years from that bleak March morning, when Cinder looked up"
4446,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"so pleadingly in the boy’s, face, Carl found himself a clerk in the"
4447,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"counting-room of a generous, kind-hearted merchant."
4448,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4449,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,“A boy who worked so hard and so patiently to take care of his little
4450,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"sisters,” this gentleman said to his wife, “and who was ready to share"
4451,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"his scanty meals with a vagrant dog, _must_ be a good boy, and good"
4452,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,boys make good men.”
4453,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4454,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"And Tony and Lena, both grown to be bright, healthy, merry girls,"
4455,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"befriended by many good women, were going to school, taking care of the"
4456,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"house, earning a little in odd moments by helping the seamstress who"
4457,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"lived on the floor below, and still looking up with love and respect to"
4458,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,the Head of the Family.
4459,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4460,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"Cinders, petted and beloved by all, performed in public no more,"
4461,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"but spent most of his time lying by the fire in winter, and on the"
4462,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"door-step in summer, waiting and listening for the step of his master."
4463,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4464,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,So you see Carl was right.
4465,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4466,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,He _did_ find his fortune among the ashes.
4467,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,
4468,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,"But would it have proved a fortune had he been a cruel, selfish,"
4469,BY MADGE ELLIOT.,hard-hearted boy?

4501,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"gentlemen of the jury,” he continued, mounting a garden-chair, and"
4502,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"making the most absurd gestures, “was declared free and independent,"
4503,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,and its brave citizens determined not to drink tea unless they chose
4504,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"to, and our cousins from the other side of the Atlantic went marching"
4505,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,home to the tune the old cow died on.”
4506,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4507,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,“What tune was that?” asked Caddy.
4508,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4509,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Gentlemen of the jury,” said Tom, “I’m astonished to find such"

4511,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"memorable tune was and still is, as _Your Honor_ well knows, Yankee"
4512,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Doodle;” and the orator, descending from the chair, commenced whistling"
4513,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,that famous melody.
4514,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4515,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Well, then,” said Caddy, after a moment’s thought, “if a Centinal is"
4516,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"something about a hundred years old, Aunt Patience is one, for she’s a"
4517,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,hundred years old to-morrow--she told me so--and she feels real bad
4518,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"’cause she can’t go to the green to see the fire-works, on ’count of"

4522,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4523,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“‘The poor-house looms,’ does it?” said Tom laughing; and then he stuck"
4524,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"his hands in his pockets, and hummed “Hail Columbia” in a thoughtful"
4525,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,manner.
4526,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4527,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“I say, Frank,” he called out at last, going up on the porch, and"
4528,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"poking his head in at a window, “what are you doing?”"
4529,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4530,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“‘The king was in the parlor, counting out his money,’”"

4534,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“How much, king?”"
4535,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4536,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Twenty--thirty--thirty-five,” said Frank, “one dollar and thirty-five"

4538,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4539,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Two, fifteen. Come out here, I want to tell you something.”"

4541,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Frank, who was two years younger than Tom appeared."
4542,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4543,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“What’s up?” he asked, throwing himself into the hammock which hung"
4544,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"from the roof of the porch, and swinging lazily."
4545,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4546,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Would it break your heart, and smash the fellows generally, if we"

4548,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,fuss we’ve made about it?”
4549,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4550,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“_What?_” asked Frank, in a tone of surprise, assuming a sitting"
4551,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,position so suddenly that the hammock--hammocks are treacherous
4552,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"things--gave a sudden lurch, and landed him on the floor."
4553,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4554,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,Tom’s laughter woke all the echoes around.
4555,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4556,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Forgive these tears,” he said, as he wiped his eyes, “and now to"
4557,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"business. You know not, perhaps, my gentle brother, that we have a"
4558,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"centenarian, or as Caddy says, a centinal among us?”"
4559,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4560,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“A centinal?” said Frank, stretching himself out on the floor where he"
4561,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,had fallen.
4562,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4563,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“A centenarian, or centinal, whichever you choose, most noble kinsman,"
4564,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,and she lives on the outskirts of this town. Her name--a most admirable
4565,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,one--is Patience. Her granddaughter’s--another admirable one--Faith.
4566,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4567,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,“Patience has the rheumatism. Faith has no shoes. They want to see
4568,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"some fire-works, and hear some Fourth of July--being centinals they"
4569,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,naturally would.
4570,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4571,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“What say you? Shall we and our faithful clan, instead of swelling the"
4572,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"ranks of the militia on the green, march to the humble cottage behind"
4573,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"the hill, and gladden the hearts of old Patience and young Faith with a"
4574,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,pyr-o-tech-nic display?”
4575,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4576,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Good!” said Frank, who always followed the lead of his elder brother."
4577,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4578,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,And “Good!” echoed Caddy; “but don’t spend all your money for
4579,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"fire-works. Give some to Aunt Patience, ’cause she’s the only centinal"
4580,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,we’ve got.”
4581,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4582,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“And she’ll never be another,” said Tom,"
4583,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4584,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“‘While the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,"
4585,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.’”
4586,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4587,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,So on the evening of the Fourth the people of Tomstown were somewhat
4588,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,astonished to see the young Centennial Guards march down the principal
4589,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"street, pass the green, where extensive preparations for festivities"
4590,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"had been made, and keep on up the hill until, beginning to descend on"
4591,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"the other side, they were lost to sight."
4592,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4593,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,At the head marched Frank with his drum. Caddy came directly behind him
4594,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"with a bunch of brilliant flowers. The others carried flags, Chinese"
4595,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"lanterns, and boxes of fire-works, while Captain Tom flew here and"
4596,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"there and everywhere, trying to keep--an almost hopeless task--the"
4597,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,mischievous company in something like order.
4598,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4599,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,“Where away?” shouted Uncle Al--an old sailor home for the holiday--as
4600,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,the guards passed his door.
4601,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4602,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“To Aunt Patience--our own special Centennial,” Frank shouted back with"
4603,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,a tremendous roll of the drum.
4604,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4605,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Uncle Al, always ready for fun, pipe in mouth, fell in line, waving his"
4606,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"tarpaulin on the end of a stick, and Ex, his yellow dog, and Ander, his"
4607,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"black one, followed after, grinning and wagging their tails."
4608,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4609,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Then the butcher’s boy, and his chum the baker’s boy, who were"
4610,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"going by, turned and joined the procession, and away they all went,"
4611,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"hurrahing, laughing and drumming, to the door of the very small cottage."
4612,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4613,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Bless my heart!” said Aunt Patience, who was sitting in a wooden"
4614,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"arm-chair on the stoop, and who, hearing faintly, poor, dear, deaf old"
4615,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"soul, the noise of the approaching “guards,” had been thinking the"
4616,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"frogs croaked much louder than usual, “what’s this?”"
4617,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4618,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"And bare-footed, brown-eyed Faith came out with wonder written all over"
4619,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,her pretty face.
4620,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4621,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,“Three cheers for our special Centennial!” shouted the boys; and they
4622,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"gave three with a will, as Caddy placed her flowers in the old woman’s"
4623,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,hand.
4624,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4625,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,“Now for the pyr-o-tech-nic display!” commanded Captain Tom; and for
4626,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"nearly an hour Roman candles fizzed, blue-lights popped, torpedoes"
4627,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"cracked, pin-wheels whizzed, and fire-crackers banged."
4628,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4629,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,Old Patience said it was worth living a hundred years to see.
4630,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4631,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"And as the last fire-work went up a rocket and came down a stick,"
4632,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"the gallant company formed in single file, and, marching past Aunt"
4633,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Patience, each member bade her “good-night,” and dropped some money in"
4634,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,her lap.
4635,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4636,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"As for Uncle Al--that generous, jolly, warm-hearted old sailor, his"
4637,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"gift was three old-fashioned silver dollars; one for himself, one for"
4638,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Ex, and one for Ander."
4639,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4640,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“No one should think,” he said, “that _his_ dogs were mean dogs.”"
4641,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,
4642,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"Then away they all went again, hurrahing, shouting, and drumming like"

4724,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4725,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Granny stopped punching her clothes, came out of the steam, and sat"
4726,BY MARY D. BRINE.,down to laugh at the new man of business.
4727,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4728,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Chub’s round face glowed with honest determination, and his roly-poly"

4730,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4731,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Yes, _ma’am_! I’m a-goin fur a bootblack, and I’m goin’ to buy an"

4734,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Where you goin’ ter git yer box and brushes, hey, Chub?” asked Granny,"
4735,BY MARY D. BRINE.,renewing her attack upon the wash-boiler and its contents.
4736,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4737,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"The boy’s countenance fell, and visions of oranges faded slowly and"
4738,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"reluctantly from his eyes. Suddenly, however, he remembered his friend"
4739,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Sim Hardy, who frequently gave him the uneaten end of a banana, and"
4740,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"now and then part of a stick of licorice, for which favors Chub had"
4741,BY MARY D. BRINE.,yielded in return a large share of his warm little heart.
4742,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4743,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Sim’ll get me a box, ’thout it’s costin’ anythin’. Maybe he’ll hook"
4744,BY MARY D. BRINE.,one fur a little chap like me.”
4745,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4746,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Granny rested from her labors and turned a stern face upon the boy.
4747,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4748,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Thomas Brown, never dare you lift a finger of yourn to touch what’s"
4749,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"been stole. Remember who’s watchin’ ye all the time, and don’t go fur"
4750,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"to sile the family name of Brown. If yer do, I’ll trounce yer well for"

4752,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4753,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"[Illustration: “GRANNY, I’AM GOIN’ INTER BUSINESS, LIKE OTHER MEN.”]"
4754,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4755,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It was probably the last awful threat that awed Chub into obedience,"
4756,BY MARY D. BRINE.,for he gave no more thought to Sim’s way of getting a machine for
4757,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"him, but tried to think of another plan."
4758,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4759,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It wasn’t long, however, before his friends among the bootblacks raised"
4760,BY MARY D. BRINE.,a sum between them and presented Chub with the necessary capital with
4761,BY MARY D. BRINE.,which to begin business in earnest. And to granny’s delight her boy
4762,BY MARY D. BRINE.,started off one fine morning regularly equipped for his first battle
4763,BY MARY D. BRINE.,for daily bread--and an orange.
4764,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4765,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"For a long time the little, six-years-old bootblack sat on the Astor"
4766,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"House steps awaiting custom. But big boys somehow grabbed all the jobs,"
4767,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and nobody noticed little Chub, nor heard his weak cry, “Shine yer up"
4768,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"fur ten cents! Want a shine, sir?”"
4769,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4770,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"So when night came, the little fellow shouldered his box and went home,"
4771,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"minus his orange, and with pockets as empty as when he started from"
4772,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"home. He cried a little, to be sure, and granny comforted him with"
4773,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"kisses, and put him to bed tenderly. For nearly a week things worked"
4774,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"very badly for Chub. Business didn’t prosper, and sitting all day in"
4775,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the hot sun made the little fellow sick of trying to be a man and do
4776,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"business. He couldn’t somehow make the thing work, and Sim Hardy, the"
4777,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"friend who would have taught him, was busy on another route, and so"
4778,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Chub sat swinging his little bare feet all day, with nothing to do but"
4779,BY MARY D. BRINE.,watch the sky and wish he could fly up to “that other world” where he
4780,BY MARY D. BRINE.,didn’t believe the “angels would let him go so long without a job.”
4781,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4782,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"One night he went home with two ten cent stamps in his pocket, and a"
4783,BY MARY D. BRINE.,prouder boy never lived. But granny’s anxious eyes saw an unusual flush
4784,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"on the boy’s cheeks, and the little hands felt dry and hot. And that"
4785,BY MARY D. BRINE.,night the boy was restless and talked in his sleep.
4786,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4787,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It had been a fearfully hot day, and granny feared the child was"
4788,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"suffering from sunstroke. So she kept ice on his head, and with part of"
4789,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the newly-earned money bought some medicine which quieted Chub and gave
4790,BY MARY D. BRINE.,him an hour’s sweet sleep just before sunrise.
4791,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4792,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Then he opened his blue eyes and told granny about a dream in which he
4793,BY MARY D. BRINE.,had seen a beautiful angel peep out of a little window in the sky and
4794,BY MARY D. BRINE.,look all about as if searching for something. And presently Chub heard
4795,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"a voice say, “Oh, there’s little Chub! I’ve found him.” Then, as he"
4796,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"looked up to see who had called his name from the clouds, the window"
4797,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"opened wide, and the angel spread beautiful white wings, as white as"
4798,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"snow, and fluttered gently down with arms opened lovingly towards"
4799,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Chub, who dreamed he was sitting with his box all that time on the"
4800,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Astor House steps. But just before she reached him he woke up, and,"
4801,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"lo and behold, all the angel his waking eyes saw was dear old granny,"
4802,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"who stood with a cooling drink beside the bed, and fanned away the"
4803,BY MARY D. BRINE.,tormenting flies.
4804,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4805,BY MARY D. BRINE.,So Chub told his dream. Granny wiped her eyes with the corner of her
4806,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"apron, and hugged her boy closer."
4807,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4808,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"[Illustration: “WANT A SHINE, SIR?”]"
4809,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4810,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“The angels can’t have ye yet, Tommy,” she said. “Yer granny’s boy, and"
4811,BY MARY D. BRINE.,this wurrld is good enuff fur ye this long while yet.”
4812,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4813,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Chub felt better the next day, and went out to his day’s business with"
4814,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"a stout little heart, and eyes full of sunbeams. Some of the sunshine"
4815,BY MARY D. BRINE.,of the day crept out of the little room with him when he left granny
4816,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"alone over her wash-tubs, but she knew when he returned at night he"
4817,BY MARY D. BRINE.,would bring it all back again. So she scrubbed and rubbed and boiled
4818,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and punched her clothes, until the room resembled cloud-land, and the"
4819,BY MARY D. BRINE.,white clothes hanging on lines shone out of the mist like the white
4820,BY MARY D. BRINE.,wings Chub had talked about.

4825,BY MARY D. BRINE.,at all.”
4826,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4827,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"A big sigh shook Chub’s breast as he muttered this, wiping the"
4828,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"perspiration from his face, and settling the torn hat more comfortably"
4829,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"on his curly head. He slid down from his seat, and stood on the edge of"
4830,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"the sidewalk a minute, waiting a chance to cross."
4831,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4832,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Hark! what a swift galloping of hoofs on the cobble-stones! Down the
4833,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"street, the closely-crowded street, dashed a runaway horse, dragging"
4834,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"the light buggy, whose owner had just vacated it. Everybody scampered"
4835,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"right and left in the first moment of terror, but a wee child,"
4836,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"frightened from its nurse’s hand, stands directly in the path of the"
4837,BY MARY D. BRINE.,swift-coming animal.
4838,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4839,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Impulsively Chub, the boy of six years, the brave little business man,"
4840,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"flings his blacking-box directly at the head of the runaway horse, and"
4841,BY MARY D. BRINE.,as fast as his short legs can carry him he rushes for the child whose
4842,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"life is in peril. In one instant the horse, startled by the well-aimed"
4843,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"blow, turns aside, and then plunges on despite the efforts of strong"
4844,BY MARY D. BRINE.,arms to stop him.
4845,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4846,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"That instant spared the little girl, but Chub’s box had opened the"
4847,BY MARY D. BRINE.,sky-window for him--poor little fellow--for over his brave little
4848,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"figure, crushing the life from his braver heart, passed the animal"
4849,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"which had jumped on one side when the box struck him, and directly in"
4850,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Chub’s line.
4851,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4852,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"They lifted him tenderly, and laid him on the broad step which had"
4853,BY MARY D. BRINE.,been the only business office Chub had owned. But only once the blue
4854,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"eyes opened, and then they sought the blue sky above, and even strong"
4855,BY MARY D. BRINE.,men felt tears in their eyes when faintly and gaspingly the dying boy
4856,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"cried, “Oh, angel! angel! here’s little Chub a-waitin’ fur yer; don’t"
4857,BY MARY D. BRINE.,ye see him?”
4858,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4859,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Then upward reached the small, brown arms, and downward fluttered the"
4860,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"white lids, which were raised never on earth again, not even when"
4861,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"granny’s tears covered the round, white face, and her arms clasped"
4862,BY MARY D. BRINE.,close the little roly-poly figure which had suddenly grown so stiff and
4863,BY MARY D. BRINE.,helpless.
4864,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
4865,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Up to “that other world,” through the “sky-window,” the white-winged"

4879,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Not the identical one that slept under the haystack, while the cows"
4880,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"trampled the corn; no, indeed, he was quite too wide awake for that!"
4881,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Our little Boy Blue had another name; but he was seldom called by it,"
4882,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,and did not much like it when he was. For when he heard people say
4883,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“John Allison Ware!” he knew that he was in mischief, and justice was"
4884,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,about to be meted unto him.
4885,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4886,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Why was he called little Boy Blue? Because, when he was a tiny baby,"
4887,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"his eyes were so very blue--“real ultramarine,” Aunt Sue said; but baby"
4888,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"only wrinkled his nose at the long word, and mamma smiled."
4889,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4890,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"However, the eyes kept their wonderful color as the baby grew up, so"
4891,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"the name was kept, too."
4892,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4893,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Boy Blue had four sisters: three older, one younger, than himself. He"
4894,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"used, sometimes, to wish for a brother, but mostly he was too busy to"
4895,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,worry over trifles. He had so much to do the days were not long enough.
4896,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4897,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,He had to work in his garden; it was about as large as a
4898,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"pocket-handkerchief, but it required a great deal of care. He had"
4899,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"to feed the kitty, help shell the peas for dinner, ride on the"
4900,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"saw-horse, and be an ice-man, a strawberry-seller, a coal-heaver and a"
4901,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"fish-monger, all with only the aid of his wheelbarrow."
4902,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4903,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Above all, he had to help Jotham."
4904,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4905,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"What Jotham would have done without his help I cannot tell. With it, he"
4906,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"kept the garden in order, mended the broken tools, made sleds, swings,"
4907,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"skipping-ropes, carts and baby-houses for the five little Wares."
4908,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4909,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"If Jotham could not have got along without Boy Blue, I am sure the"
4910,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,little Wares would have sadly missed Jotham.
4911,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4912,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"One day Jotham was making a sled for Elsie. It was June, and people do"
4913,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,not usually wish to slide on the daisies and clover; but Jotham liked
4914,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"to get things finished early. I suppose he knew, too, that when Elsie’s"
4915,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"sled was done he would have to make one a-piece for Lill, for Dora, for"
4916,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Boy Blue, and for little Tot; so, perhaps, he thought from June to"
4917,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,December was not too long time for so much work.
4918,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4919,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"The sled was ready to be painted; and blue paint, in a nice little"
4920,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"bucket, with a small brush in it, was waiting for the sled. Boy Blue"
4921,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,stood by helping.
4922,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4923,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Just then somebody called Jotham into the house.
4924,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4925,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“I might paint a little until he comes back,” thought Boy Blue. “Don’t"
4926,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"fink I’d better, maybe. Elsie said blue stripes; ’haps I shouldn’t get"
4927,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,them even. H’m!”
4928,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4929,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"The blue eyes twinkled, and the funny little mouth was puckered in a"
4930,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"round, rosy button as their owner considered the matter."
4931,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4932,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“I might practice, first,” said Boy Blue."
4933,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4934,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,So he tugged the paint-bucket down from the bench; he slopped a little
4935,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"over, too. It did not fall on his trowsers; they were short, and"
4936,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,fastened at the knee with three buttons; the blue splashes were on the
4937,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"white stockings below the trowsers, and Boy Blue saw them."
4938,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4939,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“But _they_ will wash,” said he to himself."
4940,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4941,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Then Boy Blue and the paint-bucket walked off behind the tool-house;
4942,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"that was a good place to practice, because the clapboards were so"
4943,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"smooth, and of a nice gray color, on which the blue paint showed"
4944,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,beautifully.
4945,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4946,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“I’ll make five stripes, ’cause I’m most five years old,” thought Boy"
4947,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Blue.
4948,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4949,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"The first were crooked, and he had to make five more; they-were"
4950,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"too long, so he made some shorter ones. Soon all the side of the"
4951,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"tool-house, as high as his short arm could reach, was painted in blue"
4952,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,stripes.
4953,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4954,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“If I only had a ladder!” mused Boy Blue. “Fink I’d better get one.”
4955,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4956,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"He trudged into the shed, still carrying the paint-bucket; it was not"
4957,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"so full now as when Jotham left it, and did not slop much."
4958,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4959,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"There was no ladder in the shed, so he went on into the barn."

4964,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4965,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“I’m busy now, Piggy White,” said Boy Blue, looking over the side of"
4966,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"the pen. “I’m painting. Oh my! Piggy White, you’d look just beautiful"
4967,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,if you only had some blue stripes!”
4968,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4969,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"Piggy White was a young pig, quite clean and pretty; the little Wares"
4970,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"made a pet of him. He had a fresh straw bed every night, and Jotham"
4971,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,took a deal of care to keep his house tidy. He was so accustomed to
4972,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,visits from the children he only gently grunted in reply to Boy Blue’s

4975,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,The next thing seen of that small lad he had climbed over and was as
4976,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,busy over Piggy White as he had been on the tool-house. Piggy liked to
4977,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"have his back rubbed, and was very quiet while Boy Blue painted a long"
4978,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,stripe down his spine and shorter ones across his sides.
4979,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4980,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“Piggy White, _if_ you wig your tail so I fink I’ll scold. I want to"

4982,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4983,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"By this time there was not much paint in the bucket, but there was"
4984,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"a great deal on Boy Blue’s hands, on his stockings, on the short"
4985,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"trowsers, and on the front of his little blouse."
4986,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4987,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“H’m!” said Boy Blue, suddenly looking up. “I fink--Jotham--I fink I’ve"

4989,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4990,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“The land of liberty!” said Jotham, looking down. “You’re _blue_, sure"
4991,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,enough.”
4992,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4993,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Then he picked up the little workman and carried him into the house.
4994,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4995,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"When mamma had been out and looked at the tool-house and Piggy White,"
4996,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"and had come in and looked at Boy Blue, she said what she had said"
4997,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,about five hundred times:
4998,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
4999,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“I don’t know what I _shall_ do with you!”
5000,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5001,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,But she did. For she told Nurse Norah to give him a bath.
5002,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5003,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"When he had been scrubbed and rubbed and dried, and stood very red and"
5004,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"warm to have his hair brushed, he sobbed:"
5005,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5006,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“Somebody didn’t ought to look after me better!”
5007,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5008,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“Sure, ’twould take a paycock’s eyes, and more, to look after sich a"

5010,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,said Norah.
5011,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5012,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"The organ-man carried a monkey, and the monkey carried a tambourine,"
5013,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,with which he played such pranks the little Wares fell off the steps
5014,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"one after another in fits of laughter, and Boy Blue decided at once to"
5015,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,buy that monkey if he could. So when the organ-man went away Boy Blue
5016,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"followed. Only Tot saw him go, for the others were running back to the"
5017,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,nursery to see if the dolls were awake. And Tot could not make people
5018,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"understand what her little, lisping tongue meant to say."
5019,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5020,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,It grew late and later; it was almost dark. Boy Blue did not come home.
5021,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,They began to wonder; they began to be anxious; they began to look for
5022,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"him. They called his name everywhere. They shouted, “Little Boy Blue!"
5023,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Boy Blu-u-u-e! Blu-u-u-ue!”
5024,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5025,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,He did not come. They thought what if he should never come back!
5026,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5027,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,Mamma cried.
5028,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5029,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“Somebody has stolen him!” said Norah.
5030,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5031,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“He is drowned!”
5032,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5033,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“He is run over!”
5034,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5035,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“He is--”
5036,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5037,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“_Here_ he is!”
5038,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5039,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"So he was! They had looked everywhere and inquired of everybody, and"
5040,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,given up in despair. Papa and Jotham had gone to get help in searching
5041,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,for him. Mamma was in distress. And there little Boy Blue came walking
5042,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,into the house himself!
5043,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5044,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“Where have you been?” cried the sisters.
5045,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5046,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"He had followed the monkey until he was tired, had come back unseen,"
5047,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"had climbed into the hammock in the orchard, and had been asleep there"
5048,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,ever since.
5049,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5050,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“And we just crazed about ye, ye bad boy!” said Norah, while mamma"
5051,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,hugged him.
5052,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5053,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,"“You needn’t fink _I’d_ get lost,” said Boy Blue, proudly. “_I_ don’t"
5054,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,do such fings. I want my supper!”
5055,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5056,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,He had it. But at our house we still keep asking this question:
5057,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,
5058,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,“What _shall_ we do
5059,BY C. A. GOODENOW.,With little Boy Blue?”

5067,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5068,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5069,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby Tatman was a little Yankee fellow, but he looked like an Italian"
5070,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"boy, with his tangly brown hair, and his soft, simple dark eyes. He"
5071,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,was very fond of water-melons; but he was very much afraid of ghosts;
5072,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and in his simple heart he believed everything that was told him, and"
5073,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,thereby hangs a tale.
5074,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5075,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"There was a man, whom all the neighbors knew as Uncle Ben, who had some"
5076,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,very fine water-melons--which Bobby knew all about--for they were only
5077,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,about a mile from Bobby’s father’s house.
5078,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5079,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"These were the nearest water-melons that Bobby knew of, and he used to"
5080,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"go over occasionally, with his friend James Scott, to look at them,"
5081,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,and see how they were coming on. Both Bobby and his friend grew much
5082,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"interested in the melons, as they were ripening, and Bobby wondered why"
5083,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"his father did not raise water-melons, too. This was not a large patch,"
5084,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and it was in a sunny nook of Uncle Ben’s farm, out of sight from his"
5085,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,house.
5086,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5087,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It wouldn’t be stealing to take water-melons,” remarked Bobby’s friend"
5088,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"one day, as the two were sitting on the fence alongside the little"
5089,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,patch. “It wouldn’t be any more stealing than picking off corn to
5090,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"roast, when we go a-fishing, would be stealing, as I can see.”"
5091,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5092,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I don’t know as it would be,” Bobby admitted, musingly. “I _should_"
5093,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,like that old big fellow! Uncle Ben says that’s a _mountain-sweet_. But
5094,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"it would _almost_ be stealing to take that one, sure! and Uncle Ben"
5095,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"would miss it the first thing, too.”"
5096,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5097,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I s’pose he would,” said James, “and then there’d be a row. It won’t"
5098,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"do to take that one. I tell you what, Bobby, we won’t take any of ’em"
5099,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"now, but we’ll come to-night, after dark, and then there won’t be any"
5100,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,danger of anybody’s seeing us. Of course it won’t be stealing; but
5101,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Uncle Ben’s just mean enough to make a row about it, I s’pose, if he"
5102,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,should happen to find it out.”
5103,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5104,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I guess he would,” said Bobby. “I shouldn’t want to have him see us,"
5105,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,anyhow.”
5106,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5107,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"And so, not to run any risk, they concluded to wait."
5108,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5109,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"When it was night they came again, and sat together upon the same"
5110,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"fence, listening for a time for sounds of any others who might be"
5111,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"approaching, before they got down to select their melons. All was"
5112,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"still, and, feeling secure from detection, they got down and began to"
5113,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,search among the vines. They could tell by rapping upon the melons
5114,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"which the ripe ones were, and it was not long till they had made their"
5115,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"selection, and were scudding away, each with a melon almost as large as"
5116,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"he could carry, along the fence towards Uncle Ben’s corn-field, which"
5117,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,was still farther from his house.
5118,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5119,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"When they got to the corn-field they felt safe, and, as the melons"
5120,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"were heavy, they concluded to eat one before going further. So they"
5121,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"sat down in a nook of the fence--a Virginia rail-fence, as we used to"
5122,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,call that kind--and Bobby took out a knife that he thought a great deal
5123,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"of--because his Aunt Hannah had given it him, and it had his initials"
5124,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,on a little silver plate set in the handle--and in a moment more they
5125,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,were eating and praising the delicious melon.
5126,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5127,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Of course ’tain’t stealing,” said James Scott, as Bobby again brought"
5128,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,up that question. “Uncle Ben always does have better water-melons than
5129,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"anybody else, and he can’t expect to have ’em _all_ to himself. What’s"
5130,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the use of living in a free country, if you can’t have a water-melon"
5131,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,once in a while? Help yourself. Bobby--but don’t eat too near the rind.”
5132,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5133,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby helped himself,--though he could not help thinking all the time"
5134,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"that it was to Uncle Ben’s water-melon,--and the boys filled up,"
5135,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"gradually, till they could hold no more. Then each had a great shell"
5136,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"that would have almost floated him, had he felt like going to sea in"
5137,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"it, and the question was, what to do with them."
5138,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5139,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Let’s tuck ’em under the bottom rail,” said James; “they won’t be"
5140,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,noticed there.”
5141,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5142,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"So they tucked them under the lower rail--a broad, flat rail that"
5143,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,seemed to have been made on purpose to cover them--and then they both
5144,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,got straight up on their feet to stretch themselves. In the same
5145,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"instant they both started suddenly, and took to their heels."
5146,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5147,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,They ran till they were out of breath; and James Scott got a long way
5148,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,ahead of his friend Bobby. But Bobby came up with James before he
5149,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"started again, and asked, as soon as he could get breath enough, “_Was"
5150,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,it Uncle Ben?_”
5151,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5152,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It must have been him, or his ghost,” was the reply. “Did you see his"
5153,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"legs, Bobby?”"
5154,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5155,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“No. Did you?”
5156,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5157,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It didn’t look as if he had any. He was a queer-looking chap, anyhow.”"
5158,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5159,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“I wonder if he’s coming?” And Bobby seemed almost ready to start
5160,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,again. “Do you s’pose he knew us?”
5161,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5162,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Shouldn’t wonder if he did. But, if ’twas Uncle Ben, he’d know he"
5163,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"couldn’t catch us. He must have been there all the time. I say, Bobby,"
5164,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,I’m afraid we’ll hear about this.”
5165,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5166,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I don’t see how he happened to be right there! Oh, dear! I left my"
5167,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"knife, too!”"
5168,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5169,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“I guess if t’was Uncle Ben he’ll take care of that. Of course he’ll
5170,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"know who it belongs to. If he gets that knife, he hadn’t oughter say"
5171,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,anything about the water-melon. It’s worth more’n both on ’em.”
5172,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5173,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I know it. Don’t you suppose it _was_ Uncle Ben’s _ghost_, after all?"
5174,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,I wish it was!”
5175,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5176,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It couldn’t have been, unless he’s died since noon, you know. He"
5177,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,looked well enough then. Do you s’pose it would be of any use to go
5178,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"back, Bobby?”"
5179,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5180,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“No, indeed! I’d rather go home. I wish I had my knife, though. I"
5181,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,wonder why he didn’t speak?”
5182,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5183,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“That’s what _I_ don’t understand. I should have thought he would just
5184,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"said something, before we got out of hearing.”"
5185,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5186,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Like as not it wasn’t him, after all.”"
5187,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5188,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Like as not it wasn’t, Bobby. S’posing we go back.”"
5189,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5190,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I’m going home,” was Bobby’s reply. “I don’t believe it pays to steal"
5191,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"water-melons, anyway.”"
5192,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5193,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“’Twasn’t stealing, Bobby!--no such thing! Of course anybody’s a right"
5194,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"to take a water-melon. Uncle Ben had no business to raise ’em, if folks"
5195,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,had got to steal ’em before they could eat ’em!”
5196,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5197,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“That’s so,” groaned Bobby. “I shouldn’t have thought he’d have planted"
5198,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,them.”
5199,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5200,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"And so, groaning in spirit, Bobby went home. He had lost his knife, and"
5201,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,everybody would know next day that he had been stealing water-melons.
5202,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He couldn’t help thinking that the folks would call it _stealing_,"
5203,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,after all.
5204,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5205,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,What to do he didn’t know; but he must go home at all events. He was
5206,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"never out very late, and when he went in his mother asked him where he"
5207,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,had been. He said he had been over to James Scott’s.
5208,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5209,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I don’t like to have you over there so much, Bobby,” said his mother."
5210,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“I am afraid James Scott is not a very good boy.”
5211,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5212,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby’s face was flushed, and he seemed very tired, so his mother told"
5213,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"him he had better go to bed. He was glad enough to go, but he lay a"
5214,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"long time thinking of his knife and the water-melons, and of Uncle Ben"
5215,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"standing there by the fence, before he went to sleep."
5216,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5217,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby slept in the attic, up under the roof. There was another bed in"
5218,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the same attic for the hired man. There were also a great many things
5219,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"for which there was no room anywhere else,--large chests, piles of"
5220,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"bedding, and things that had got past use."
5221,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5222,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Bobby got to sleep at last; but he awoke in the night--something
5223,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"unusual for him--after the moon had risen, and was giving just light"
5224,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"enough to show things in the room very dimly. He opened his eyes, and"
5225,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,almost the first object he saw caused his heart to beat very quickly.
5226,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Somebody was sitting upon one of those large chests. It was a dim and
5227,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"indistinct form, but it looked ghostly white in the moonlight, and"
5228,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby could not help feeling afraid. He had never seen a ghost, fairly,"
5229,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,but he began to think now that he had one in his room.
5230,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5231,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby lay and watched that ghost, feeling warm and cold by turns, till"
5232,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,at last he was sure it was beginning to look like Uncle Ben. The wind
5233,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"had begun to blow, and to move the branches of the old elm outside,"
5234,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,thus causing the moonlight to flicker fitfully in the room. It seemed
5235,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"as if it must be Uncle Ben! Bobby could see him laugh, though he could"
5236,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,not hear a sound except the sighing wind and the swaying branches of
5237,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the old elm, mingling dolefully with the snoring of the hired man."
5238,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5239,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"The ghost laughed and shook his head by turns, and pointed his finger"
5240,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"at Bobby, as if to say, “_I’ve marked you!_”"
5241,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5242,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby began to imagine that Uncle Ben had been run over by a cart, or"
5243,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"killed in some way that very afternoon, and that his ghost was really"
5244,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"there. He was almost glad it was so, for he could endure the ghost,"
5245,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"disagreeable as he felt his presence to be, much better than meet Uncle"
5246,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Ben alive, with that knife in his possession."
5247,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5248,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"So he shivered, and sweat, and reasoned himself more firmly into the"
5249,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,belief that it was Uncle Ben’s ghost that was sitting on the chest. He
5250,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"was glad of it, for now he could go in the morning and find his knife,"
5251,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,and hide that other water-melon before anyone else should pass that
5252,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,way. Still the presence of the ghost was very disagreeable to him; and
5253,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,at last he ventured to go and get into the other bed with the hired
5254,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"man, rather than lie longer alone."
5255,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5256,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"The hired man stopped snoring, turned over, woke up, and asked Bobby"
5257,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,what was the matter.
5258,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5259,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“There’s somebody up here,” said Bobby, ashamed to own that it was a"
5260,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,ghost.
5261,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5262,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“Who? where?” and the hired man sat up and looked around.
5263,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5264,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“On that chest,” said Bobby. “Don’t you see him?”"
5265,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5266,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Ye--yes; I see him.” And, as if afraid to speak again, the hired man"
5267,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,watched the blinking countenance of the stranger closely.
5268,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5269,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"After a moment he got out of bed carefully, saying in a whisper as he"
5270,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,did so:
5271,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5272,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“How long has he been there, Bobby?”"
5273,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5274,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Ever so long,” was Bobby’s reply. “Ain’t it a ghost?”"
5275,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5276,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I guess so. I’ll find out, at all events,” and the bold fellow moved"
5277,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,carefully towards it.
5278,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5279,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He approached on tiptoe till he could almost touch it, and then he"
5280,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,stopped.
5281,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5282,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It’s a ghost, Bobby,” said he, “sure enough; but I’ll fix him!”"
5283,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5284,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He just drew back one arm, and planted a prodigious blow right in the"
5285,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,ghost’s stomach; and you ought to have seen that ghost jump!
5286,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5287,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"It went almost out of the window at one leap; but fell short, on the"
5288,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"floor, and lay as if dead. The hired man went boldly back and got into"
5289,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"bed, remarking:"
5290,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5291,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“That’s one of the ghosts we read about, Bobby; I guess he won’t"
5292,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,trouble _us_ any more!”
5293,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5294,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Bobby did not quite understand it. He began to think that Uncle Ben
5295,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"might be still living; but he went to sleep again, at last, and the"
5296,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"next time he awoke it was morning. It was daylight, and the hired,"
5297,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"man had gone down-stairs. He looked for the ghost. There he lay, sure"
5298,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"enough, very quiet on the floor, but, after all, it was only a bag of"
5299,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,feathers!
5300,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5301,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"So Bobby felt sure he would have to meet Uncle Ben, and that everybody"
5302,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"would know all about it; and he felt very miserable all day, waiting"
5303,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"for him to come. He did not go near James Scott, for he felt that it"
5304,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,was largely owing to him that he had got into trouble. It wasn’t at all
5305,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,likely that he could or would help him out of it. He wanted dreadfully
5306,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"to go and look for his knife, but would no more have done that than"
5307,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"he would have gone and drowned himself. Indeed, he did think rather"
5308,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"seriously of doing the last; but, being a good swimmer, he supposed the"
5309,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"probabilities would be against his sinking; and besides, he still had a"
5310,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,regard for the feelings of his mother.
5311,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5312,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"It was a miserably long day, but after all Uncle Ben did not come. What"
5313,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"could it mean? Bobby did not know, but he went to bed and slept better"
5314,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the next night. And the next day his fears began to wear away. It was
5315,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"night again, and still Uncle Ben had not come."

5317,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"The third morning Bobby was almost himself again. He was resolved, now,"
5318,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,to go and look for his knife. It must be that Uncle Ben had not found
5319,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"it. If he had, he would certainly have made it known before this. He"
5320,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"was quite sure, too, that Uncle Ben could not have known who those two"
5321,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"boys were. So he went, with a lightened heart, early in the day, to"
5322,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,look for his knife.
5323,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5324,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Of course he took a roundabout way, that he might keep as far from"
5325,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Uncle Ben’s house as possible. Judge of his surprise and relief when he
5326,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"saw, on coming in sight of the spot, not Uncle Ben, but a dilapidated"
5327,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"_scarecrow_. It stood leaning against the fence, where, having served"
5328,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"its time, Uncle Ben had probably left it, neglected and forgotten."
5329,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Being arrayed in one of Uncle Ben’s old coats, it did have a strange"
5330,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,resemblance to the old man himself.
5331,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5332,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“It’s all right, after all,” thought Bobby, and he hurried confidently"
5333,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,forward to pick up his knife. But imagine now the surprise and fright
5334,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,that came into Bobby’s soft eyes when he found that his knife was not
5335,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"there! Neither the knife, the water-melon, _nor the water-melon rinds_!"
5336,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,All were gone.
5337,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5338,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Without stopping long, Bobby turned to retrace his steps. But as he"
5339,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,did so some one called to him. It was Uncle Ben; and he stopped again
5340,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,and stood mute.
5341,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5342,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I’ve been waiting to see ye, Bobby,” said the old man, coming up. “I"
5343,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"reckoned you’d come for your knife, and I thought you’d rather see me"
5344,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,here than have me bring it home to ye. Of course I knew you’d been
5345,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"here, when I found this, but it wasn’t likely you’d come alone. I’m"
5346,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"sorry you’ve been in bad company, Bobby. Your father and mother think"
5347,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"you’re a good boy, and I don’t want them to think any other way. Of"
5348,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"course _you_ don’t want them to think any other way, either, do you,"
5349,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Bobby?” And the old man looked kindly down into the soft eyes.
5350,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5351,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Bobby made out to say that he did not.
5352,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5353,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“That’s the reason, Bobby, why I didn’t bring the knife home. I thought"
5354,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"I’d better give it to ye here. Now take it, and don’t for the world"
5355,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,ever say a word to anybody how you lost it. And I want ye to come down
5356,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"to the melon-patch with me, for I’m going to send a nice mountain-sweet"
5357,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,over to your mother.”
5358,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5359,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Bobby took his knife, and followed Uncle Ben, unable to utter a word."
5360,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"As they went along, the old man talked to him of his corn and his"
5361,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"pumpkins, just as if there was no reason in the world why he and Bobby"
5362,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,should not be on the best of terms. He seemed to have quite forgotten
5363,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,that Bobby had ever stolen anything from him. Arrived at the patch he
5364,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"picked off one of the finest melons, as large as the boy could carry,"
5365,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and, after a little more talk, sent him with it to his mother."
5366,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
5367,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"And so, after all, Bobby’s heart never felt lighter than it did that"
5368,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"morning, after he had left Uncle Ben. He had at last found words to"
5369,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"thank him, and to say that he was very sorry for what he had done, but"
5370,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"scarce more. But that was all Uncle Ben wanted; and, so long as he"
5371,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"lived, after that, he had no truer friend among the neighbor’s boys"
5372,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,than Bobby Tatman.

5603,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,BY HOLME MAXWELL.
5604,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5605,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Felice was a servant. She was just twenty years old, but she was like a"
5606,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"child in our land. She talked a little, soft, broken English; our words"
5607,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"were very, very hard for her fine, pretty Italian lips to manage. She"
5608,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"was tall, and extremely refined and delicate; every one admits this"
5609,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"now, but her little girl-mistress saw it at a glance, as Felice came in"
5610,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"behind papa, pausing, tall and slender, with her exquisite brown hair"
5611,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"and brown eyes, to be addressed."
5612,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5613,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Here is your mistress,” said the papa to Felice, indicating the young"
5614,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"girl dressed in white. “She is the little woman of the house, and will"
5615,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,tell you about your duties.”
5616,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5617,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Felice bowed like a tall lily, as the “mistress,” so much younger and"
5618,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"so much smaller than herself, came forward, slowly and with irregular"
5619,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"steps, leaning upon a fairy sort of cane. “You are pretty, pretty,"
5620,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"pretty--pretty as I could ask for,” said the young girl."
5621,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5622,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Felice was not accustomed to be taken by her mistresses with two
5623,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"tender, white hands, and called “Pretty, pretty, pretty.” A soft color"
5624,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"came into her pale, clear cheeks, and her eyes grew liquid as she bent"
5625,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,over the little girl without speaking. But when the little girl turned
5626,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"away, looking so quaint in her stylish white dress, as she leaned upon"
5627,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"her little cane, Felice instinctively followed her. She placed the"
5628,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"velvet hassock under her feet as she sat down, and slipped the cane"
5629,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,into the “rest” attached to the small lounging-chair.
5630,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5631,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Can you make a bed nicely, Pretty?” said the little girl."
5632,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5633,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Yes, mees,” answered Felice."
5634,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5635,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Can you put the room nicely, Pretty?”"
5636,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5637,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Yes, mees.”"
5638,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5639,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“And do birds and flowers and gold-fish prosper with you, Pretty?”"
5640,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5641,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“I cannot tell you, mees.”"
5642,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5643,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“Can you sew nicely?”
5644,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5645,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Mees say _nicely_--no, alas! I work not with the needle, none, in four"
5646,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,year.”
5647,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5648,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Well, then, can you read,--our English books? you know,--and a long"
5649,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"while at a time? Pray, don’t say no.”"
5650,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5651,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Alas, mees, I know not to read the Ingleese, none. Ah, mees, I think"
5652,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,now to my heart this is one meestake. You wish not me. You wish not one
5653,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,chambermaid.”
5654,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5655,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“You cannot know what I wish, my Pretty.” But the little mistress’s"
5656,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,face was downcast and clouded. From under her sunny eyelashes she
5657,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"studied the long, slender, folded hands of poor “Pretty.” They were"
5658,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"browned and hardened with rougher labors than hair-dressing, and"
5659,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"embroidering, the mending of laces, or the tending of flowers."
5660,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5661,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"She pointed at last to a door across the hall. “Your room, Pretty. Have"
5662,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,your things brought up.”
5663,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5664,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“_Felice_,” corrected the soft Italian lips."
5665,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5666,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“No, _Pretty_,” persisted the little mistress, with a lovely smile."
5667,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5668,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,This little girl of fourteen--Lulu Redfern--was mistress of many
5669,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"things: of a brown-stone mansion, of her papa, and of his immense"
5670,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,wealth. She was almost like a fairy in her willfulness and in her
5671,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,power. Why might she not change her servant’s name if she chose?
5672,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5673,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"While “Pretty” was gone, Mr. Redfern came back. “Papa,” said the"
5674,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"mistress, “of what were you thinking? Pretty does not sew, does not"
5675,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"understand flowers and pets, does not read, does not even dress hair!”"
5676,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5677,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Don’t she?” said papa, crestfallen. “Why, she looks as if she did.”"
5678,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5679,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Papa, did you ask at all?”"
5680,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5681,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“No,” confessed papa, “I did not. I supposed, of course, she could;"
5682,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"else why did she apply. Can’t she be of any use, my birdie?”"
5683,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5684,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“I don’t see how, papa.”"
5685,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5686,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Well, then, we shall have to send her away, I suppose. I fancied she"
5687,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,would be quite the person you would like to have about you--she is so
5688,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"different from that fluttering, nervous French Adele. But you certainly"
5689,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,do not need another mere chambermaid.”
5690,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5691,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Yet, papa, I cannot have her go, now that she has come. Can’t I keep"
5692,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"her, papa, to look at? She won’t cost so much as a Sevres vase.”"
5693,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5694,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Felice, with her droopy face and soft steps, was passing. She had a"
5695,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"small satchel in one hand, and in the other--what do you suppose?"
5696,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5697,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"A violin-case, little, black, old."
5698,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5699,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“Whew!” said papa to himself. “That’s queer luggage.” But Miss Redfern
5700,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,did not see the queer luggage.
5701,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5702,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"So “Pretty” staid, on the footing of a Sevres vase; and drooped over"
5703,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"and about her little mistress like a beautiful lily wherever she went,"
5704,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,and that was nearly all she could do for many days.
5705,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5706,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Now, this little girl, who could have everything almost, could not"
5707,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,have everything quite. She loved music beyond all things else; but on
5708,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,account of her little lame feet she could not play. The grand piano was
5709,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,for the guests. Rare players used to come and play for her; and none of
5710,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"the music ever seemed to depart from the house, so that all the rooms"
5711,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"were haunted by divine harmonies. When Lulu lay awake at night, kept"
5712,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"awake by pain, the wondrous strains played themselves again at her ear,"
5713,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"and the sweet, pure young soul took wings to itself, and swept away and"
5714,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"away among lovely scenes, until lameness and pain and a thwarted life"
5715,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,were quite forgotten.
5716,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5717,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"It was one night, about a week after Felice came. She had lifted her"
5718,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"mistress into bed, and had said, “I wish you a most lofely good night,"
5719,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Mees Looloo,” and had gone. It was not a “most lofely” night. “Mees"
5720,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Looloo’s” little feet were throbbing with pain worse than ever before;
5721,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,but about midnight she was growing hushed and serene. There were wafts
5722,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"and breathings of Mendelssohn, and Wagner, and Mozart, and Beethoven"
5723,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"all about her; and she was falling asleep, when, suddenly, a fine,"
5724,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"sweet, joyous, living strain pierced through the dreamy songs and"
5725,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,harmonies.
5726,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5727,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Lulu lifted her head. She knew in a moment that _this_ was real
5728,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"music. Enchanting as were her dreams by both night and day, no one"
5729,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,so clear-headed as the little mistress. She had sat and listened too
5730,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"often for coming and going feet, for closing doors, to be mistaken as"
5731,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,to the source of any sound. This midnight music came from “Pretty’s”
5732,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"room; and she who loved reed, and pipe, and horn, and string so well,"
5733,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,knew that it was the rarest violin-music.
5734,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5735,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,It was entrancingly sweet. Air after air entirely unknown to the
5736,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,little music lover floated out on the still midnight. Poor little Miss
5737,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Redfern! She buried her face in her pillows and sobbed in an ecstasy of
5738,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"happiness. “Now I know what it is so pure, so high, that I see in my"
5739,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Pretty’s face. It is that which is in the faces of all the artists that
5740,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,come here. My Pretty is no servant. Papa said that she looked as if she
5741,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,could do all these things--papa felt she was an artist. Papa could not
5742,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"help bring her, I could not help keep her,--O, my own Pretty!”"
5743,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5744,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"By and by the music ceased; and, listening, Lulu heard the violin"
5745,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,deposited in the box.
5746,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5747,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"She looked bright as a bird when her maid came to lift her to the bath,"
5748,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"next morning. “Ah, Mees Looloo, I wish you a lofely good morning.”"
5749,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5750,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“It is both lovely and good, dear Pretty,” said the child-mistress,"
5751,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,stooping to kiss the long artist fingers busy with her sleeve-buttons.
5752,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“I understand these fingers now.”
5753,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5754,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Haf you not always understood their mooch slow ways, Mees Looloo?”"
5755,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5756,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Mees Looloo” clasped the two strong, nervous hands close to her"
5757,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,breast. “Pretty! I know what they were made for; they are the
5758,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,musician’s hands. I heard you last night. I heard a violin in your
5759,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"room. How could you have it here, Pretty, and not bring it out when I"
5760,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,am often so tired and need to be soothed?”
5761,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5762,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“O, Mees Looloo, I haf not thought. I haf played when I could not haf"
5763,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"sleep to mine eyes, and haf thought of Etalee.”"
5764,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5765,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Then Lulu heard the simple story. It was the violin belonging to
5766,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Felice’s father, and Felice had handled it from her babyhood. She had"
5767,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,brought it to America and had carried it from place to place with her.
5768,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,Nobody had cared; nobody had questioned the poor young chambermaid.
5769,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5770,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,But “Mees Looloo” cared. “Pretty” brought the violin as simply as if
5771,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"bidden to bring a flower or a book. It was old, dark, rich--mellow in"
5772,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,its hues as in its tones.
5773,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5774,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“May papa come up?”
5775,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5776,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,[Illustration]
5777,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5778,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“I haf always lofed to please you, mees,” said “Pretty.” “But I haf"
5779,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,nevaire learn moosic. I haf none other but vary old moosic.”
5780,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5781,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"There were, indeed, some old, yellow sheets of foreign music lying in"
5782,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,the bottom of the case; but Felice did not take them out. “I know in my
5783,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,heart this moosic--father’s lofely moosic.”
5784,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5785,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"She lifted the instrument to her bosom. She laid her clear, dark cheek"
5786,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"against it lovingly, in the unconscious fashion of the true lovers of"
5787,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"the violin; her fingers, long, supple, dark, sounded the chords; the"
5788,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"bow gleamed and glanced as it sought the strings; and, bending over it,"
5789,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“Pretty’s” young face paled and flushed gloriously, as the father’s"
5790,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“lofely moosic” stirred her two listeners to tears.
5791,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5792,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,The child mistress talked to papa in a very excited manner as he bore
5793,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"her away on his shoulder to the breakfast-room. Papa listened, papa"
5794,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"thought, and, finally, papa assented."
5795,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5796,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“I think so, dear. She is worth it! There are only you and I to spend"
5797,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"the money, and why shall we not do as we like, birdie?”"
5798,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5799,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,So little lame Miss Redfern was to be a Patron of Music. That was
5800,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,almost as good as to be a musician.
5801,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5802,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,“Pretty” could refuse nothing to her dear little mistress. In her
5803,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"loving simplicity she did as she was bidden, even to the trying on of"
5804,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,one handsome dress after another when she was taken to the fine shops.
5805,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"And at night, after the hair-dresser was done with the soft curls of"
5806,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"her brown hair, and she stood before the mirror in her lace frills and"
5807,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"silk dress, she simply said in her soft, limited English, “You have"
5808,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"made me mose lofely, Mees Looloo.”"
5809,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5810,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"In the evening, when the invited guests--bearded and spectacled men,"
5811,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"and fine and gracious women--were gathered down in the gardens below,"
5812,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"among the lighted trees and the fountains and the arbors, the tall,"
5813,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,simple “Pretty” obeyed her mistress again without a question. Lifting
5814,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"her violin to her bosom, she came out upon the balcony, and played"
5815,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,once more the old Italian music. With bared heads and silent lips the
5816,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,company of musicians stood to listen.
5817,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5818,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Soft bravos, fluttering handkerchiefs, showers of fresh flowers,"
5819,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"greeted simple “Pretty.” They thought her some new star, and this her"
5820,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,private _début_.
5821,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5822,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,What was their surprise to hear it was the little Miss Redfern’s maid
5823,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,whom they had thus quietly been brought to see and pass judgment upon!
5824,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"But, gracefully, nay generously, they acknowledged her as thoroughly"
5825,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,worth the musical education Mr. Redfern and his daughter were planning
5826,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,to bestow.
5827,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5828,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"To simple “Pretty” herself, simple with all the honesty and"
5829,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"unconsciousness of true genius, the great plan was not at all too"
5830,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"strange, nor too great. If one had offered her beauty or pleasure in"
5831,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"another shape, she might have drawn back from the gift--but not from"
5832,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,music. It did not seem to surprise her that she was going back to the
5833,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"Old World, and not as a steerage passenger, but dressed in costly"
5834,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"robes, and under the care of friends, to study with the great masters"
5835,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,of music.
5836,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,
5837,BY HOLME MAXWELL.,"“I will come back, dear Mees Looloo, and sing to you and the kind papa"

5855,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"The clock in the warm, bright kitchen was striking nine; not nine"
5856,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"in the morning, but nine in the evening, which is a very different"
5857,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"thing, as the old clock seemed to know, for it counted off the chime"
5858,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"with a soft, sleepy roll, as if bent upon making the least possible"
5859,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,disturbance.
5860,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5861,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,Dolly put the cookies into the deep tin box that had held thousands
5862,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"of such dainties in its day, set the lid a-tilt upon the edge, gave a"
5863,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,glance of satisfaction at the great loaves peeping out from the white
5864,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"cloth that covered them, the row of pies on the shelf below, and the"
5865,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"plump chickens trussed up sociably on the platter, and then came out"
5866,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"from the pantry, and shut the door upon the savory smells. Dolly was"
5867,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"not a beauty, but she had a clear, fresh face, and was full of health"
5868,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"and vigor and content. She was a model housekeeper, too, as the old"
5869,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"clock could have testified, and this was the first time it had been"
5870,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,called upon to countenance such irregular doings as the turning of
5871,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"night into day. But this was the night before Thanksgiving, and when"
5872,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"one is cook, chambermaid, housekeeper, and mistress of the manse,"
5873,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,she certainly has a right to regulate her own days in spite of the
5874,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,almanac-man.
5875,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5876,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Yes, and nurse besides; for on the lounge lay Dolly’s mother, not"
5877,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"exactly sick, but weak from a long fever that had left her ankles so"
5878,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,swollen and painful that she could not walk a step without assistance.
5879,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Bess and Johnny had been away through it all, but now their father had"

5890,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,sleepily at Dolly.
5891,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5892,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“All but the candy, and that’ll not take long,” said Dolly cheerily."
5893,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5894,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“For pity’s sake, do let the candy go; the children are just as well"
5895,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,off without it.”
5896,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5897,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Oh, but I promised Johnny I’d have some for him, and it wouldn’t seem"
5898,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"like Thanksgiving without it. The nuts are all cracked, and I’ll sit"
5899,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"here and pick out the goodies while the molasses boils,” and Dolly"
5900,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"whisked out the clean iron skillet, and poured the molasses in so"
5901,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,quickly her mother could only say: “You’ll kill yourself working so
5902,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"hard, and what good do you think that will do the children?”"
5903,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5904,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Choog! choog!” said the molasses in its hurry to get out of the jug,"
5905,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,and Dolly smiled as she coaxed it to make less haste and more speed.
5906,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5907,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“I’m tough as a pine knot,” she said, merrily; “but if I were really"
5908,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"going to die I should like to have the children say, ‘She always tried"
5909,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"to help us have good times, and the very last night she was here she"
5910,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,made us some candy.’”
5911,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5912,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,There was a foolish little moisture in Dolly’s eyes as she dropped into
5913,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the low-cushioned chair, the same old creaky chair in which her mother"
5914,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"had rocked her when she was a baby, and in which she herself had rocked"
5915,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Bess and Johnny scores of times. She was very tired, now that she came"
5916,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"to sit down and think about it, and her little speech wakened a sort of"
5917,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,pathetic pity for herself. She even began to fancy what they would all
5918,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"do without her, but just at that point the molasses made a sudden rush"
5919,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"for the top of the skillet, and put an end to her musing."
5920,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5921,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,Mrs. Marshall roused up a little also.
5922,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5923,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,“It seems so strange to have Thanksgiving come without a flake of snow!
5924,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Joel says it is as dry as midsummer, too. I never feel easy about the"
5925,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,stacks until there’s a good fall of snow.”
5926,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5927,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Joel is very careful,” suggested Dolly, “and father plowed a good"
5928,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,strip around the stacks before he went away.”
5929,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5930,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Yes, I know. But what good would a few furrows do against a prairie"
5931,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,fire such a time as this?”
5932,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5933,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,“Then we’ll hope the Lord’ll not let a fire start in such a time as
5934,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"this,” and Dolly seized her boiling syrup at the precise moment of"
5935,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"crispiness, poured it over the plump white kernels spread thickly in"
5936,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the shallow pans, and set the whole to cool in the back kitchen."
5937,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5938,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"When everything was tidy, and Dolly was ready to help her mother to"
5939,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"bed, the old clock ventured to remark, in the same soft purr as before,"
5940,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,that it only lacked two hours to midnight; to which Dolly smilingly
5941,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,answered that Thanksgiving only came once a year.
5942,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5943,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“How the colts stamp,” said Dolly. “I wonder if Joel could have"
5944,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,forgotten to water them before he went home.”
5945,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5946,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Joel ought not to have gone home,” said her mother. “It isn’t right"
5947,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,for two lone women to be left with no neighbors within a mile. Are you
5948,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"sure the fire is all right, Dolly? seems to me there’s a smoky smell in"
5949,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,here.”
5950,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5951,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“It’s the molasses, I dropped a little on the stove; but I’ll go out"
5952,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"and see that all is right after you are in bed, and then we shall both"
5953,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,feel better.”
5954,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5955,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Dolly went without her lamp, and as she passed the hall window she"
5956,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"caught sight of a dull red glow, down against the dark horizon. In"
5957,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"another instant she stood outside, her rosy color all blanched at sight"
5958,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"of the fire sweeping down the prairie on those swift, terrible wings of"
5959,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,the west wind. For an instant she was dizzy and confused with terror at
5960,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the thought of her utter helplessness, then, as if a voice had repeated"
5961,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"it to her, she recalled the verse she had read that morning, “_What"
5962,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee_,” and, with a silent prayer for"
5963,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"help, she went back to her mother."
5964,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5965,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“The prairie is on fire,” she said, trying to speak quietly."
5966,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5967,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Her mother sprang from the bed, and sank down, almost fainting, from"
5968,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,pain.
5969,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5970,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“O Dolly!” she gasped, “we shall die here all alone.”"
5971,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5972,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“I’ll make a good fight, first,” said Dolly, bravely. “I must go and"
5973,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"do what I can, and you must wait here and _pray_. Only perhaps you had"
5974,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"better get your clothes on again, in case of the worst.”"
5975,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5976,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Dolly threw some heavy shawls upon the bed, placed her mother’s clothes"
5977,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"within reach, hugged her once, and rushed away. In two minutes more she"
5978,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"had put on Joel’s boots, tied up her curly head in an old comforter,"
5979,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,and buttoned herself into her father’s coat. She was ready to fight
5980,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"fire, and she knew just how to do it. But first the colts must be"
5981,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,taken from the low thatched stable that would be sure to blaze at the
5982,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,first spark. Already they were growing restless with the strong smell
5983,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"of smoke, and that strange intuition of danger which horses seem to"
5984,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"possess. Dolly had some difficulty in leading them out, and then she"
5985,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"hardly knew what to do with them, for she knew well enough they would"
5986,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,go scouring off when the fire came near. She was a quick-witted little
5987,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"woman, however, and she soon had the colts in the back kitchen, tied"
5988,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,fast to the old carpet loom. Then she filled the tubs and pails with
5989,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"water, and set them along the line of the buildings, cut some heavy"
5990,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"branches of hemlock, and brought out the horse-blankets and dipped them"
5991,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,in water.
5992,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
5993,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"The house, behind its clump of evergreens, might possibly escape, but"
5994,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"there seemed little chance for the low barn, the granary, and the"
5995,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"immense stacks of hay, yet in them lay their hopes for a year, and"
5996,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,Dolly determined not to give them up without a desperate struggle.
5997,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"She scarcely dared look at the fire, but she saw once how a brighter"
5998,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,light leaped up as the flames caught a barn or a stack of hay in the
5999,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,distance. As rapidly as possible she broadened the circle about the
6000,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"line of buildings, lighting the thick grass with one hand, and dashing"
6001,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"out the flame with the other, when it threatened to go beyond her"
6002,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,control. She felt almost guilty as she saw the blaze she had kindled
6003,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"go sweeping away towards the east, carrying the same terror to others"
6004,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"which was rapidly coming down upon her, but it was her only chance of"
6005,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"escape, and there was not another house between them and the river. She"
6006,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"worked on in desperation as the air grew thick with smoke, and at last"
6007,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,she could hear the roar and crackle when the flames swept the great
6008,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"corn-field, fairly leaping along the rows of dry stalks. It was almost"
6009,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"upon her, and she ran back within her burned circle, and waited for"
6010,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,doom.
6011,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6012,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Her hands were blistered, her eye-lashes were burned off, but she did"
6013,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"not know it. She only watched, with every nerve tense and throbbing, to"
6014,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"see if the fire would leap the line. It died down a little in spots,"
6015,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"crept sullenly along the edge, as if loth to go by, flamed up here and"
6016,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"there at a bunch of tall weeds, then, with a sudden puff, the wind"
6017,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,lodged a whirling handful of cinders at the foot of the great straw
6018,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,stack!
6019,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6020,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Dolly sprang at it like a tiger, tearing away the burning straw, and"
6021,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,striking right and left with the wet blanket. Then a little blaze crept
6022,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"under the fence, and she beat the life out of it in a breath. Another"
6023,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"whirl of cinders upon the roof of the stable, but they fell black and"
6024,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"harmless. Then another blaze running along the edge of the shed, but"
6025,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the water was ready for it; and Dolly, with eyes everywhere, ran, and"
6026,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"beat, and trampled, until at last the fire veered away to the south,"
6027,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,and left the little homestead safe in the midst of a blackened waste.
6028,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6029,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Dolly walked back and forth, around the stacks and the buildings,"
6030,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"whipping out the smallest sparks, and then turned towards the house in"
6031,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,a stupor of exhaustion. She wanted to lie right down on the warm ground
6032,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"by the side of the straw pile, and go to sleep, but she had enough"
6033,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"sense left to reach the house, and make her way to her mother’s room."
6034,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6035,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“We’re all right, mother,” she said in a husky voice, “the fire has"
6036,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"gone by;” and dropping upon the bed, smoke, dirt, boots, and all, she"
6037,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"sank into a heavy sleep. Her mother tried in vain to rouse her, so she"
6038,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"dragged the shawls over her, and watched anxiously for morning. But as"
6039,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the gray light began to reveal Dolly’s face, she was terrified at its"
6040,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"ghastly whiteness, intensified by the soot and smoke which begrimed it."
6041,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"She tried again to rouse her, but Dolly lay in a stupor, and she could"
6042,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,only clasp her hands and pray for help. She crept painfully from the
6043,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"bed, and was trying to drag herself to the door, when Joel rode up on"
6044,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"horseback, with his wife behind him. She was a stout, red-cheeked young"
6045,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"woman, and, springing off without waiting for help, ran to the back"
6046,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"kitchen, where there were sounds of some one stirring."
6047,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6048,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Miss Dolly splittin’ kindlin’s, I’ll be bound! Joel’s jest that"
6049,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"shiftless not to think on’t. My gracious Peter!” she exclaimed, as she"
6050,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"suddenly opened the door, and found herself confronted by one of the"
6051,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,colts.
6052,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6053,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"She left Joel to settle matters with the colts, and made her way to"
6054,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Mrs. Marshall and Dolly, carrying the poor lady back to bed in her"
6055,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"strong arms, as if she had been a baby."
6056,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6057,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Don’t you worry about Dolly, ma’am,” she said, confidently, “she’ll"
6058,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"sleep it off, and come out all right, and I’ll just take off my things"
6059,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"and do for you. I can stop as well as not; our house was burned up, and"
6060,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"we just managed to save ourselves, so you see I ain’t got a smitch o’"
6061,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,work to do for myself.”
6062,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6063,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Your house burned! Oh, Sarah, how hard that is for you and Joel,” said"
6064,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,Mrs. Marshall.
6065,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6066,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Yes’m, it’s a kind of a pity, and I’d got the nicest kind of a chicken"
6067,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,pie ready for Thanksgivin’. We never see the fire till it was jest
6068,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"ketchin’ holt of us, and then we got on the colt and raced it down the"
6069,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"gully to Dickerman’s pond ahead of the fire. We just made a go of it,"
6070,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"and set there till mornin’. Says I, ‘Joel, it’s Thanksgivin’ day; be ye"
6071,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"right down thankful?’ And Joel he looked at me and says, kind o’ solemn"
6072,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"like, ‘_Yes, I be!_’ And so be I, ’cause we might ’a been burned in our"
6073,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"bed, leastways I might, if Dolly hadn’t been so considerin’ as to let"
6074,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,Joel come home.”
6075,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6076,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Sarah had been all the time tugging at Dolly, pulling off boots and"
6077,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"coat, and undoing her scorched hair. She bathed her face and hands, and"
6078,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"lifted her upon the pillow, but Mrs. Marshall’s terror only increased"
6079,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"at seeing Dolly remain perfectly passive, never opening her eyes,"
6080,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,and allowing Sarah to lift her as if she were dead. Hour after hour
6081,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"she slept on, only when Sarah raised her on her vigorous arm, and fed"
6082,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"her with chicken broth, forcing it patiently into the closed mouth,"
6083,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"until at last a little color crept into the pallid face, and the sleep"
6084,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"was not so death-like. But even at nine o’clock, when the travelers"
6085,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"arrived, Dolly gave them a doubtful recognition. She smiled faintly at"
6086,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"the children’s kisses, stared for an instant at her father’s anxious"
6087,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"face, and then went on dozing and muttering. Bess stole in and out on"
6088,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"tiptoe, the tears dropping down on her pet kitten, and Johnny blundered"
6089,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,about with his mouth full of delicious candy his very heart dissolving
6090,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,with grief and gratitude.
6091,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6092,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"Dolly talked about the candy, and Johnny was impressed with the idea"
6093,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"that she wanted some, and actually made an attempt to administer"
6094,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"a small chunk, but he was not very successful, and Dolly kept on"
6095,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,muttering: “The very last night she was here she made them some candy;
6096,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,the very last night; the very last night; but they couldn’t find it;
6097,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,they never could find it; the fire came and burnt them all up; the very
6098,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,last night; the--very--last--night.”
6099,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6100,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"If there had been a doctor at hand, Sarah would have given up her"
6101,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"patient to a course of brain fever, with proper deference; but as"
6102,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,there was none within twenty miles she was compelled to persevere with
6103,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"her sensible applications of water, friction, and chicken broth, and"
6104,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,in a couple of days she had the satisfaction of seeing Dolly laugh in
6105,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"quite a natural fashion at Joel’s story of the gray colt, which was"
6106,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,taken from the kitchen with one foot firmly bedded in a pan of molasses
6107,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,candy.
6108,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6109,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“’Twasn’t all stepped on,” said Johnny, “and I saved you a chunk. I’m"
6110,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"awful glad you made it, ’cause nobody ’tended to Thanksgiving very"
6111,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,much.”
6112,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6113,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“I’m glad I made it,” said Dolly, “for I should not have seen the fire"
6114,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,in time if I had gone to bed earlier. I remember something foolish
6115,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"about its being my last night,” and Dolly smiled doubtfully at her"
6116,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"mother, not feeling quite sure what she had said, and what she had only"
6117,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,thought.
6118,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6119,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“It was not foolish at all, dear,” said her mother, kissing the"
6120,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"scorched fingers. “Nothing better could be said of any life, than that"
6121,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,it was a sacrifice for others.”
6122,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,
6123,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"“Shet yer eyes, Dolly, and never mind about yer last days,” said Sarah,"
6124,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,"decidedly; “you won’t see ’em this fifty year, if things is managed"
6125,BY EMILY HUNTINGTON MILLER.,anyway reasonable.”

6137,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6138,BY ELLA FARMAN.,And who do you suppose rang at the Doll Doctor’s door one Saturday.
6139,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6140,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Two noticeable personages, I assure you."
6141,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6142,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Three or four lovely phaetons were drawn up before the house; the
6143,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"drawing-room was open; and pretty faces, set in brown, and black, and"
6144,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"yellow hair, and crowned with flowery hats, were looking out until"
6145,BY ELLA FARMAN.,every one of Miss Chatty’s windows seemed like a painting thronged with
6146,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cherubs; small ladies, gloved and parasolled, and draped _à la mode_,"
6147,BY ELLA FARMAN.,were coming and going up and down the front steps; and Miss Teresa Drew
6148,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"was just stepping from the beautiful family carriage, that had its"
6149,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"coachman, and its footmen, and its crested panels, and her tall French"
6150,BY ELLA FARMAN.,maid was behind her with a doll and a doll’s maid in her arms--but all
6151,BY ELLA FARMAN.,the gay show didn’t begin to attract the attention that was universally
6152,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"bestowed, the moment they appeared in sight, upon the two queer little"
6153,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"beings who came across the street, unattended and on foot, right up to"
6154,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty’s gate.
6155,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6156,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But, you see, _they_ were gotten up in their very, very best. I am not"
6157,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"a fashion writer, my dears, and I couldn’t begin to tell you, so that"
6158,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"you would have a clear idea, how Miss Teresa Drew was dressed; but I"
6159,BY ELLA FARMAN.,must try to give you the _tout ensemble_ of these two new children.
6160,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“_Tout ensemble_,” my Wide Awakes, is one of those French phrases that"
6161,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"mean so much, and are so handy, but which take so many of our English"
6162,BY ELLA FARMAN.,words in the translation; a little miss of my acquaintance renders it
6163,BY ELLA FARMAN.,as “the _all-over-ness_ of a person.” The costume of these children had
6164,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"a peculiar _all-over-ness_. Their shawls, a pair of ragged and worn"
6165,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"broches, enveloped them to the throat and dragged after them; and the"
6166,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"effect over short dresses and bare legs was striking; and the shawls,"
6167,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"in both cases, were surmounted by old straw hats which looked, for all"
6168,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the world, like two much-battered toadstools."
6169,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6170,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Miss Chatty happened to see them coming up to the door, all her"
6171,BY ELLA FARMAN.,richly-dressed little people drawing aside to let them pass; and
6172,BY ELLA FARMAN.,she dropped her order-book and made her way through her _à-la-mode_
6173,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cherubs, and answered the door-bell herself."
6174,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6175,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Be you the Doll Doctor, mem?” asked the elder of the children."
6176,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6177,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty intimated that she was.
6178,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6179,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“They told us as wot you lived here, mem, and as how you could put"
6180,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the wust cases together.” Opening her shawl, she drew forth a bundle,"
6181,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and, dropping upon one knee, undid it deftly. She was self-possessed"
6182,BY ELLA FARMAN.,in spite of her bare feet; but Miss Chatty was much embarrassed. The
6183,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"children, evidently, were street Arabs, and she hesitated, from various"
6184,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"reasons, to ask them in among her little girls; but neither had she the"
6185,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"heart to dismiss them; besides, she was, withal, considerably curious"
6186,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and amused. The hands busy with the bundle were very hard, and very"
6187,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"tanned; the face, all intent upon the knot of the string, was strangely"
6188,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"quaint and mature,--indeed, the utter absence of childish timidity and"
6189,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"embarrassment was perhaps the chief reason why Miss Chatty hesitated,"
6190,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"with such a dear, funny, soft-hearted manner, in her treatment of these"
6191,BY ELLA FARMAN.,new patrons.
6192,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6193,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Finally the knot was untied. A couple of dolls’ heads were displayed,"
6194,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"very much curtailed as to nose, badly rubbed as to their black china"
6195,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"curls, and sadly crackled as to their cheeks, as cheeks will after long"
6196,BY ELLA FARMAN.,painting.
6197,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6198,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“There, mem, Nib and me, us found these in an ash bar’l one day,” said"
6199,BY ELLA FARMAN.,the girl. “But jest heads hain’t much to hug; and Nib and me’s got
6200,BY ELLA FARMAN.,nither time nor patterns for bodies; and wen us heard as wot there
6201,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"was a Doll Doctor, us done ’thout a breckfus mornin’s, and saved up"
6202,BY ELLA FARMAN.,fer ter buy ther cloth an’ ther waddink. Ther cloth is ter cut out
6203,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ther bodies, and ther waddink is ter stuff ’em--Nib an’ me don’t like"
6204,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"sawdust--waddink won’t go ter run out ’f ther’s a rip. An’, mem, Nib"
6205,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"an’ me, us hopes as they’ll be done a-Saturdy. An’ here, mem, is wot"
6206,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"us hopes’ll make a dress for ’em both. An’ here, mem, is ther thread"
6207,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ter sew it. An’ this here, mem, in this little paper, is some adgink"
6208,BY ELLA FARMAN.,for ter trim ther things. An’ us is werry pertic’ler ’bout its bein’
6209,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"a-Saturdy, mem, as Sundy gits ter be a-lonesum with nothink ter do."
6210,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Hain’t Sundy a-lonesum, Nib?”"
6211,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6212,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“You bet!” affirmed Nib.
6213,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6214,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"All the cherubs, haloed with the pretty hair and crowned with the"
6215,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"flowery hats, and Miss Chatty, too, would, doubtless, have been very"
6216,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"much shocked had Nib’s voice not been like a little flute, and the"
6217,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"eyes she lifted, like two great big violets, and the teeth she showed,"
6218,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"beautifully white. But when lips and lids closed again, she was as"
6219,BY ELLA FARMAN.,homely as the other; and then everybody _was_ shocked at what they had
6220,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"heard, the cherubs looking at each other, and the Doll Doctor’s face"
6221,BY ELLA FARMAN.,becoming much suffused as she received the young rag-pickers’ spoils.
6222,BY ELLA FARMAN.,But she could not send them away. She shuddered at the old calico.
6223,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Still she respectfully took it.
6224,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6225,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Us want’s ’em as tall as this, jest about,” continued Meg, showing"
6226,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty a strip of paper. “Us thinks that’s the purtiest size for a
6227,BY ELLA FARMAN.,doll.”
6228,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6229,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Miss Chatty was scarce able to speak even now; for the audacity, the"
6230,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"simplicity, and the perfect good faith of the rag-baby “order” was"
6231,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"as paralyzing as it was funny. She was a dear, honest Christian, but"
6232,BY ELLA FARMAN.,she couldn’t think quite what to do with her new customers much more
6233,BY ELLA FARMAN.,readily than would Sexton Brown had Nib and Meg gone into Grace Church
6234,BY ELLA FARMAN.,on Sunday. It was well for Sexton Brown that Nib and Meg had never
6235,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"heard that God the Father was preached at Grace Church, or they might"
6236,BY ELLA FARMAN.,have gone in.
6237,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6238,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Meg, at last, seemed struck by the silence of the Doll Doctor. “Mem,”"
6239,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"said she, hastily, “don’t you go fer ter be afeard us won’t pay. Us has"
6240,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"got ther money saved up--hain’t us, Nib?”"
6241,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6242,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“I’m not afraid, not at all,” said Miss Chatty. “And they will be done"
6243,BY ELLA FARMAN.,on Friday. Come for them on that day. I am always extremely busy on
6244,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Saturday.”
6245,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6246,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"At that Meg looked much pleased. “Mem, ’f you do do us a nice job, an’"
6247,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"so prompt-like, ther’s lots of girls us knows as’ll get you ter fix"
6248,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ther dolls. Us girls thet sells things hain’t got no time fer nothink,"
6249,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and us couldn’t go fer ter sew and cut out if us had!”
6250,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6251,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Evidently not. Nib and Meg, under the shawls, were picturesque with"
6252,BY ELLA FARMAN.,tatters.
6253,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6254,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Us wants our dolls tidy and lovesome, mem,” she added, caressingly"
6255,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"touching the white cotton in Miss Chatty’s hand, and feasting her"
6256,BY ELLA FARMAN.,eyes upon its whiteness perceptibly. Miss Chatty saw it; and she saw
6257,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"something else at the same moment,--direful gaps and rents about the"
6258,BY ELLA FARMAN.,childish waist betraying that there was sad lack of “whiteness” for
6259,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"little Meg’s own wear,--poor Meg! that wanted her dolly “tidy and"
6260,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"lovesome,” feasting upon the one shred of wholesome white cloth,--Miss"
6261,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Chatty knew the little girl’s soul to be clean by that token; and if
6262,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"she had halted in her treatment before, she took the little ones right"
6263,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"into her heart now, which was a much lovelier place than her parlor."
6264,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6265,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Don’t you think, mem, as ther’s likely to be adgink for all ther"
6266,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"underclothes, cos us’d get more ef ther wasn’t.”"
6267,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6268,BY ELLA FARMAN.,[Illustration]
6269,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6270,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty was sure there would be plenty; and Nib and Meg went down
6271,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the steps and away, at their leisure. “My! wasn’t them thar swell"
6272,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"girls!” said little Nib, all aloud. “But I didn’t care; did you, Meg?"
6273,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"An’ I seed derlicious dolls in ther,--I’ll bet ourn’ll have flouncers,"
6274,BY ELLA FARMAN.,or sumthink.”
6275,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6276,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Miss Chatty, hearing, resolved there should, at least, be “sumthink.”"
6277,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6278,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Her little ladies all were looking at her as she re-entered the
6279,BY ELLA FARMAN.,drawing-room. They were ready to burst forth into a breeze of fun
6280,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and ridicule, or to be very sorry,--just which way their dear Doll"
6281,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Doctor gave the cue. She laid the bundle on the shelf, the pink calico"
6282,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"by itself in a bit of paper, and wrote down the order. “Poor little"
6283,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"waifs,” she sighed. “Think of it, children, how hard they try to be"
6284,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"like other folks, and how much they seem to wish for something to love!”"
6285,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6286,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"There was a little hush, until Teresa Drew spoke. “I never thought of"
6287,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"it, but I wonder what street-children do do for dolls!”"
6288,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6289,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“Madame ought not to have to touch objects from the barrel of the
6290,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"ashes; it is very mooch disgoosted,” said Teresa’s French maid. She"
6291,BY ELLA FARMAN.,stooped and whispered to her little mistress. The child directly took
6292,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"out her purse, and laid a shining half eagle on the table by Miss"
6293,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Chatty’s hand.
6294,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6295,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Please buy them both a nice, well-dressed doll, with plenty of"
6296,BY ELLA FARMAN.,’adgink’ on the clothes. Who would think they could care for lace! We
6297,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"must tell mamma that, Hortense.”"
6298,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6299,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty kissed her kind little customer. All her little ladies were
6300,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"pleased if she shook hands when they came, and very happy indeed if"
6301,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"she twined a curl over her finger, or re-tied a sash,--for she had the"
6302,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"dearest and daintiest of mother-ways. “My dear,” she said, “I think"
6303,BY ELLA FARMAN.,the little girls would feel tenderest toward the very dollies they
6304,BY ELLA FARMAN.,have worked so hard to get. But I should like to buy clothing for the
6305,BY ELLA FARMAN.,children themselves with your gold piece.”
6306,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6307,BY ELLA FARMAN.,The idea roused a creditable little _furore_ of benevolence among the
6308,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"children. Every tiny pocket-book came open, and although there was no"
6309,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"more gold, Miss Chatty soon became the treasurer of a respectable fund"
6310,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"for the benefit of Meg and Nib, whom several now remembered to have"
6311,BY ELLA FARMAN.,seen as rag-pickers and match-girls.
6312,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6313,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Indeed, there was so much generous talk about Meg and Nib that when"
6314,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Miss Chatty went to bed she dreamed a very long and very nice dream.
6315,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6316,BY ELLA FARMAN.,In this dream all the pavements in the city were fringed with
6317,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"toadstools, and the stems were little girls, each with a doll in her"
6318,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"arms, and they were all on their way to her house to be mended. When"
6319,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"all had arrived, a tall, white angel came, and stood in the door and"
6320,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"looked in. And she said, “Behold, I am she that weepeth over the woes"
6321,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"of children. I sit upon a cloud over this city. To-night, on the"
6322,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"evening air, I listened for the noise of crying and quarreling, and,"
6323,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"instead, I heard laughter, and playing, and lullabies. The thanks of"
6324,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"one that weeps are sweeter than all others. Take my blessing, O giver"
6325,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"of dolls, because you have learned that a little girl, to be good, must"
6326,BY ELLA FARMAN.,have something to love.”
6327,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6328,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Then the children sang “bye-low-baby-bye” in soft tones; and after
6329,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"they were through singing, they sat and nodded deliciously,--children,"
6330,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"dolls, and she, too; and all this while the Angel of the Children’s"
6331,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Woes sat in their midst on a canopied coach that had a coachman, and a"
6332,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"footman, and a French maid, and rested from her tearful labors--indeed"
6333,BY ELLA FARMAN.,her eyes grew every moment of a most bright and smiling azure; and
6334,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"while she was resting, on a loom of silver she wove edging until there"
6335,BY ELLA FARMAN.,was a great plenty to have trimmed all the dolls in the world.
6336,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6337,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"It was quite a pleasant dream, in fact; and Miss Chatty woke with her"
6338,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"heart all soft, and young, and warm, and it staid so all day Sunday."
6339,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6340,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"After breakfast, Monday morning, she put on her holland gloves and went"
6341,BY ELLA FARMAN.,out to dig around her roses. She desired the circle of dark loam about
6342,BY ELLA FARMAN.,her trees to be exactly and truly round. So she found it necessary to
6343,BY ELLA FARMAN.,do her own digging.
6344,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6345,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"As she set her foot on the spade, a little voice she knew called from"
6346,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the bottom of the garden. “Please, Miss Chatty, were there a great many"
6347,BY ELLA FARMAN.,nice dolls brought Saturday?”
6348,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6349,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"And another little voice continued, “May we go and see them?”"
6350,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6351,BY ELLA FARMAN.,It was Sylvey Morgan and Teddy. They were looking over the broken
6352,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"paling of the garden fence, their little faces twinkling with smiles"
6353,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and sunshine.
6354,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6355,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Yes, birdies. You may go up through the basement, and I will step over"
6356,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and see Mintie.”
6357,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6358,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"The children flew to the gate and up to the house, for you must know"
6359,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"that it was very nice, indeed, to go up to Miss Chatty’s parlors and"
6360,BY ELLA FARMAN.,look at the beautiful dolls all by themselves. They well knew they
6361,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“mustn’t touch;” and Miss Chatty was well assured they wouldn’t.
6362,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6363,BY ELLA FARMAN.,She picked some clove pinks and went over to the house of the children.
6364,BY ELLA FARMAN.,It was a small cottage in vines fronting a back street. She went around
6365,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"to the sitting-room, where, by the window, sat a young girl with a"
6366,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"poor little pinched-up face. A cane, gayly painted, and adorned with"
6367,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"a flowing ribbon bow, leaned against the window, and told the girl’s"
6368,BY ELLA FARMAN.,story.
6369,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6370,BY ELLA FARMAN.,The room was very plain only about this corner. This nook had a bird
6371,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"cage and a hanging basket of ivy in the window; Mintie’s chair, with"
6372,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"its gay cushion, stood on a Persian mat; there was a little window"
6373,BY ELLA FARMAN.,garden growing on the ledge; and on the elbow stand was a globe with
6374,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"gold fish, while opposite hung some pretty water colors. Mintie’s hair"
6375,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"was tied back with a rose-pink bow, and her wrapper was a marvelous web"
6376,BY ELLA FARMAN.,of roses and posies. Altogether the endeavor to surround poor Mintie
6377,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Morgan with brightness and beauty was very evident.
6378,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6379,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But Mintie herself looked peevish, and as if never anything in the"
6380,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"world had been done for her. It was plain she was no nice, ideal"
6381,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"invalid, but a girl whom to take care of would be a great trial."
6382,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6383,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"She did smile, however, as she took Miss Chatty’s clove pinks. “You"
6384,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"always bring enough, and plenty of grass and leaves, so that there is a"
6385,BY ELLA FARMAN.,chance to try a bouquet. I believe you do it that I may fuss with them
6386,BY ELLA FARMAN.,half the forenoon if I like.”
6387,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6388,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Miss Chatty colored a trifle at being detected. “Well, that is nothing"
6389,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"against me, I hope, Mintie. How do you feel to-day?”"
6390,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6391,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“O, good-for-nothing, and all tired out just to think it is Monday"
6392,BY ELLA FARMAN.,morning instead of Saturday night.”
6393,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6394,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“I do wish you had something pleasant to occupy yourself with,” said"
6395,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Miss Chatty, sympathetically, instead of whipping out the little sermon"
6396,BY ELLA FARMAN.,on contentment. She had always thought she wouldn’t thank anybody to
6397,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"preach contentment to her, had she been broken-backed and with no feet"
6398,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"to speak of, like Mintie."
6399,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6400,BY ELLA FARMAN.,“Isn’t there anything you can do?”
6401,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6402,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Of course there isn’t,” said Mintie. “I want something pretty if I"
6403,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"have anything, work which will make me forget I am in this chair. I"
6404,BY ELLA FARMAN.,won’t sew the children’s clothes. Father and mother should contrive
6405,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"that I was amused. And if you felt so very bad for me, Miss Chatty, I"
6406,BY ELLA FARMAN.,guess you would have offered to let me dress some of them dolls before
6407,BY ELLA FARMAN.,now!”
6408,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6409,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“So I might, I should think myself,” said Miss Chatty, startled into"
6410,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"saying a very unwise thing; for, of course, a ten-dollar doll wasn’t to"
6411,BY ELLA FARMAN.,be put in careless fingers.
6412,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6413,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“But, of course,” continued Mintie, fretfully, “you don’t have more"
6414,BY ELLA FARMAN.,than you can do yourself.”
6415,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6416,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“No,” said Miss Chatty, much relieved, “I don’t. But, poor little"
6417,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Mintie, you ought to have something nice to do!”"
6418,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6419,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"“Well, you need all the money, and I shouldn’t like to work, even at"
6420,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"anything pretty, unless I was paid. I don’t wish to talk about work at"
6421,BY ELLA FARMAN.,all unless that is understood. You needn’t ever bring anything here to
6422,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"do just to amuse me.” And Mintie looked,--only think of a young girl"
6423,BY ELLA FARMAN.,looking as ugly as pictures of misers that you have seen!
6424,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6425,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"As for Miss Chatty, she blushed clear up to her eyes. “My dear child!”"
6426,BY ELLA FARMAN.,she exclaimed. “How could you think I should be unjust!”
6427,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6428,BY ELLA FARMAN.,And then she went and stood in the door. The dear little old maid was
6429,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"dreadfully ashamed, and a trifle indignant, too, over Mintie’s bad"
6430,BY ELLA FARMAN.,manners and selfishness. But after a moment she reflected that probably
6431,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"the poor girl had no pocket-money at all, and couldn’t get any either;"
6432,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and she recollected also that it had been said that physical deformity
6433,BY ELLA FARMAN.,often produced spiritual crookedness and halting. She tried to think of
6434,BY ELLA FARMAN.,some way to help her. She thought of offering Nib’s and Meg’s dolls to
6435,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"make and clothe; but no, Mintie wished to handle only beautiful things."
6436,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6437,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"All at once her dream came up before her, as pleasant as in her sleep,"
6438,BY ELLA FARMAN.,and it seemed to turn inside out and reveal its meaning.
6439,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6440,BY ELLA FARMAN.,She went back and kissed Mintie. Then she went home and kissed Sylvey
6441,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and Teddy and sent them away. After that she made herself ready, and"
6442,BY ELLA FARMAN.,went upon another eccentric little journey among her wealthy friends.
6443,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6444,BY ELLA FARMAN.,It is said that Miss Chatty talked a deal of beautiful and flowery
6445,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"nonsense at every house where she called, all about the influence upon"
6446,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"poor children of a flower to watch, or a bird to tend, or a lovely doll"
6447,BY ELLA FARMAN.,to love. She told everybody that she was going to send a missionary in
6448,BY ELLA FARMAN.,the shape of a pretty doll to every ragged and dirty child in the city.
6449,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6450,BY ELLA FARMAN.,They laughed at the idea of the doll-mission; but as she begged at
6451,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"most places for nothing more than “pieces,”--bits of silk and bright"
6452,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"woolens, remnants of ribbons and laces, the natural leavings of"
6453,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"dressmaking, of which there is always plenty at every house,--Miss"
6454,BY ELLA FARMAN.,Chatty did not render herself very obnoxious.
6455,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6456,BY ELLA FARMAN.,But at three or four houses there was far more weighty talk; and from
6457,BY ELLA FARMAN.,them Miss Chatty took away considerable money. Then she went down upon
6458,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Vesey Street, and one of her friends among the merchants gave her a"
6459,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"roll of bleached muslin, and the same good man also gave her a card of"
6460,BY ELLA FARMAN.,edging in the name of his little daughter. She then went down farther
6461,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"still, to Bleecker Street, where a jolly young importer of cheap toys"
6462,BY ELLA FARMAN.,sold her a gross of china dolls at cost.
6463,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6464,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"Tuesday, all day, she cut patterns of skirts, and polonaises, and"
6465,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"basques, and fichus, and walking jackets, all as fanciful as possible,"
6466,BY ELLA FARMAN.,bearing in mind the temper of her seamstress.
6467,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6468,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"On Wednesday she went over to Mintie, carrying the bundles and her own"
6469,BY ELLA FARMAN.,walnut cutting board.
6470,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6471,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"And when Mintie had looked at the great army of curly-pated dolls,"
6472,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"with their naked little kid bodies, every one of them wearing the same"
6473,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"rosy smile, and had laid all the lustrous silky velvets to her cheek,"
6474,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"and had sheened the silks over her knee, and had delighted with the"
6475,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"laces and the iris ribbons, she did smile, the first sunny smile of"
6476,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"her blighted life, I do believe; and she said she should be very, very"
6477,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"happy, and that she should dress no two dolls alike; and she never"
6478,BY ELLA FARMAN.,mentioned her wages at all.
6479,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6480,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But after Miss Chatty had unfolded her plan, and told her how well"
6481,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"she was to be paid, Mintie became cross again. She said after the"
6482,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"dolls were done it was a shame for ragged children to have them, and"
6483,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"they would have to be taken from her house to be distributed, for she"
6484,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"couldn’t, and wouldn’t, bear the sight of such creatures!"
6485,BY ELLA FARMAN.,
6486,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"But in what manner the Doll Mission was organized, and how the lovely"
6487,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"missionaries did their work, and whether the Angel really stopped"
6488,BY ELLA FARMAN.,"weeping, will make another long story; and it will be still more"
6489,BY ELLA FARMAN.,beautiful than this and the other.

6503,BY E. F.,"One year Mrs. Dumpling was ill all the summer, and there was nobody"
6504,BY E. F.,"much to tend the kitchen garden, except Dimple."
6505,BY E. F.,
6506,BY E. F.,"Dimple was extremely sturdy, but being shorter than the spade, he could"
6507,BY E. F.,"not use the spade at all; and he was so very much shorter than a hoe,"
6508,BY E. F.,"that the hoe kicked, and generally hit Dimple on the nose; and before"
6509,BY E. F.,"summer was out he was so much shorter than the weeds, that when he"
6510,BY E. F.,"went to pull them, the weeds felt quite at liberty to turn about and"
6511,BY E. F.,"pull him; they’d hang back and pull, and pull, until they got Dimple"
6512,BY E. F.,"all excited and puffing, and then they’d suddenly let go his little"
6513,BY E. F.,"hands, and down would go Dimple on the ground, over on his back, pulled"
6514,BY E. F.,"right off his little roots,--his little feet, I mean,--while the weeds"
6515,BY E. F.,"would just swing, and nod, and shake with laughter, and then they would"
6516,BY E. F.,"grow--oh, _how_ they would grow! A little rough pulling at one, if you"
6517,BY E. F.,"don’t get pulled clear off your feet and out of your place, is so very"
6518,BY E. F.,good for anybody.
6519,BY E. F.,
6520,BY E. F.,"Dimple finally gave up the weeds, and tended the vegetables only. He"
6521,BY E. F.,"cultivated them with a stick, scratching along the roots, and making"
6522,BY E. F.,the soil black and loose. One day he sat under a shady row of tall
6523,BY E. F.,"mustard-weeds, and scratched along a line of some feathery green stuff"
6524,BY E. F.,"his mamma had sowed. He sat poking the dirt, and thinking what a pretty"
6525,BY E. F.,"green plants turned as the dirt was stirred, when suddenly, poking away"
6526,BY E. F.,"a big stone, he saw something white, and round, and wrinkled, just like"
6527,BY E. F.,"a head,--an old man’s bald head!"
6528,BY E. F.,
6529,BY E. F.,"“Why,” said Dimple, “who’s here?”"
6530,BY E. F.,
6531,BY E. F.,"He dug a little, and he came to some sleepy old eyes, all shut, and"
6532,BY E. F.,"wrinkled, and peevish."
6533,BY E. F.,
6534,BY E. F.,“Why-ee!” said Dimple. “It _is_ somebody!”
6535,BY E. F.,
6536,BY E. F.,"He dug and dug, and he came to a nose,--an awful big nose."
6537,BY E. F.,
6538,BY E. F.,“Why-ee!” said Dimple. “It’s a Roman nose. I fink it is a grandpa.”
6539,BY E. F.,
6540,BY E. F.,"He dug a little mite more, and there were some moustaches growing right"
6541,BY E. F.,"out of the big nose. He pulled and pulled with his two forefingers, and"
6542,BY E. F.,"loosened them up, and all at once they flopped out of the dirt; and"
6543,BY E. F.,they were two long waxed moustaches.
6544,BY E. F.,
6545,BY E. F.,"Dimple was so surprised he said nothing this time, but dug away, almost"
6546,BY E. F.,"scared. Pretty soon he found a mouth, a large funny mouth, close up"
6547,BY E. F.,"under the nose, and the mouth was dreadful live and quirky."
6548,BY E. F.,
6549,BY E. F.,"“Why-ee-ee!” said Dimple. “I fink it _is_ somebody, and he’s waking up!”"
6550,BY E. F.,
6551,BY E. F.,"For now the eyes did seem to twinkle, and the little bare skull to wink"
6552,BY E. F.,and move its wrinkles up and down.
6553,BY E. F.,
6554,BY E. F.,"Dimple dug away again, and found a chin and some straggling beard."
6555,BY E. F.,
6556,BY E. F.,"“I fink what it is now,” said Dimple. “Mamma readed about him yes’day."
6557,BY E. F.,"He lives down in the mines. He’s a Kobold, and he wants to get out.”"
6558,BY E. F.,
6559,BY E. F.,"It was so bad to be stuck fast in the dirt, Dimple dug now just as hard"
6560,BY E. F.,as he could. The little old man himself didn’t help at all to loosen up
6561,BY E. F.,"his two long, slim legs. Finally Dimple, with a mighty effort, and by"
6562,BY E. F.,"shutting both eyes hard, pulled them out, and he tumbled over on his"
6563,BY E. F.,"back, and the little old man tumbled over on _his_ back, and lay like"
6564,BY E. F.,one dead.
6565,BY E. F.,
6566,BY E. F.,Then Dimple saw he had no arms. “Dee-me!” said he. “I be’eve he started
6567,BY E. F.,"to bring up some gold, and the other Kobolds ran after him and cut off"
6568,BY E. F.,his arms. Dee-me! I fink what if he has got up so far and beed-ed to
6569,BY E. F.,deff!”
6570,BY E. F.,
6571,BY E. F.,"Dimple scampered in, and his face was so white, and his story so wild,"
6572,BY E. F.,that Mrs. Dumpling managed to walk up into the garden.
6573,BY E. F.,
6574,BY E. F.,"Dimple took her to the place; the little old man was there, sure"
6575,BY E. F.,"enough. Mrs. Dumpling saw him herself, in a glimmering dazed kind of"
6576,BY E. F.,"way, for just one moment,--his twinkling eyes, his bald skull, his"
6577,BY E. F.,"Roman nose, his long moustaches, and his straggling beard."
6578,BY E. F.,
6579,BY E. F.,Then she sat down on the grass and laughed.
6580,BY E. F.,
6581,BY E. F.,She picked him up; and the moment she touched him there was an awful
6582,BY E. F.,"transformation. Even Dimple saw it was only a parsnip,--a pronged,"
6583,BY E. F.,"ill-shaped, tough old parsnip."
6584,BY E. F.,
6585,BY E. F.,But that night something happened which Dimple never forgot. The old
6586,BY E. F.,Parsnip-Man came to his bed and spoke to him. But I regret to say that
6587,BY E. F.,he used many large words which Dimple could not understand.
6588,BY E. F.,
6589,BY E. F.,"“Kind sir,” said he, “naturally we are a fine and shapely race,--we,"
6590,BY E. F.,and our cousins the Beets and the Carrots and the Salsify. If we
6591,BY E. F.,"are brought up, as every new generation ought to be, with tender"
6592,BY E. F.,"surroundings, and kept out of the company of stones and clods and"
6593,BY E. F.,"weeds, we have a dear promise that many of us shall be placed on the"
6594,BY E. F.,"dinner-table when children eat, and be changed into rosy cheeks, and"
6595,BY E. F.,"white arms, and handsome young bodies, and live a long, merry life"
6596,BY E. F.,above ground in the sunshine. But if we are neglected by those upon
6597,BY E. F.,"whom we are dependent, we are changed underground, and become horrid"
6598,BY E. F.,"old fellows, with ugly faces; and when we are pulled up, we are carted"
6599,BY E. F.,away and fed to cattle.
6600,BY E. F.,
6601,BY E. F.,“_Do you know what it must be to be fed to cattle?_” he roared.
6602,BY E. F.,
6603,BY E. F.,"And then, after a moment, he smiled mournfully. “A word to the wise,”"
6604,BY E. F.,"he said. The low, pleading tone floated all about Dimple like a"
6605,BY E. F.,"cool, green leaf. When he looked up to ask what the “Word” was, the"
6606,BY E. F.,Parsnip-Man had disappeared.
6607,BY E. F.,
6608,BY E. F.,Dimple told his mamma in the morning. Mamma knew the “Word” very well.
6609,BY E. F.,"She said it was too bad, and she would have the parsnip-bed hoed that"
6610,BY E. F.,very day.

6618,BY SALOME.,
6619,BY SALOME.,
6620,BY SALOME.,"Little Dorr Eastman always wore his sword--in the daytime, I mean. He"
6621,BY SALOME.,"would have liked to wear it at night--indeed, he tried it once; but"
6622,BY SALOME.,"as the belt was indispensable, and that was exceedingly rasping and"
6623,BY SALOME.,"uncomfortable with a night-gown, and as he often rolled upon the sword"
6624,BY SALOME.,"itself, and the sword, being hard, hurt his soft, plump side, and his"
6625,BY SALOME.,"soft, plump limbs, he gave it up, regretfully, since it was Dorr’s"
6626,BY SALOME.,belief that “real truly” soldiers always slept with their “arms” on.
6627,BY SALOME.,"And Dorr “knew”--for was not his brother Dick a colonel, and his father"
6628,BY SALOME.,"a general, and his grandfather a general?"
6629,BY SALOME.,
6630,BY SALOME.,"But, then, they had been at West Point, and got toughened. After he"
6631,BY SALOME.,"grew up and had been at West Point, and had undergone discipline,"
6632,BY SALOME.,"doubtless a belt would not be uncomfortable in bed, and a sword could"
6633,BY SALOME.,be worn with a night-gown!
6634,BY SALOME.,
6635,BY SALOME.,The fancy-store in the village where Dorr’s papa owned a summer
6636,BY SALOME.,"mansion, drove a flourishing trade during the season in gilt papers,"
6637,BY SALOME.,"and mill-boards, and tinsels; for, once a week, at least, the young"
6638,BY SALOME.,"soldier fashioned new stripes and epaulets; one day being a sergeant,"
6639,BY SALOME.,"on the next a major; and then, for days together, commander-in-chief"
6640,BY SALOME.,"U. S. A., during which space mamma, and Trudie, and Soph addressed him"
6641,BY SALOME.,as His Excellency. Every stick which he could hew into the shape of
6642,BY SALOME.,"a horse’s head, became a gallant charger, until mamma’s hall was one"
6643,BY SALOME.,"long, vast stable; mamma blew a whistle for _reveillé_; and the embryo"
6644,BY SALOME.,"cadet thought nothing of turning out at five in the morning, and"
6645,BY SALOME.,"splashing into a cold tub, especially on picnic mornings. But Dorr said"
6646,BY SALOME.,he was hardening for West Point and glorious campaigns.
6647,BY SALOME.,
6648,BY SALOME.,"[Illustration: “HOLD YOUR HAND, NOW.”]"
6649,BY SALOME.,
6650,BY SALOME.,"His greatest anxiety was concerning these campaigns. “Mamma,” he said"
6651,BY SALOME.,"to her one day, “I fears there’s no use in me growing up!”"
6652,BY SALOME.,
6653,BY SALOME.,"“Why, Your Excellency? It grieves me to hear that,” said mamma."
6654,BY SALOME.,
6655,BY SALOME.,"“’Cause everybody will be fighted out before that, mamma. Colonel Dick"
6656,BY SALOME.,"says they settle things now, and not fight.”"
6657,BY SALOME.,
6658,BY SALOME.,"“Well, my little son, there will always be men who must wear swords,"
6659,BY SALOME.,"to make people afraid, so that they will think it is the safer way to"
6660,BY SALOME.,"settle without a war. My little Dorr shall be one of those men, and"
6661,BY SALOME.,a great share of the time he will be home on furlough and stay with
6662,BY SALOME.,mamma. Won’t he like that?”
6663,BY SALOME.,
6664,BY SALOME.,"“No, he wouldn’t!” cried Dorr, stoutly, swelling up after the manner of"
6665,BY SALOME.,"colonels and generals. After a turn or two across the room, he came"
6666,BY SALOME.,"back to his mamma’s knee. “It’s likely, though, there’ll be Injuns."
6667,BY SALOME.,"There always was Injuns in this land, Trudie says, and if they’s lasted"
6668,BY SALOME.,"s’long, it’s likely they’ll last s’long as I live; and Dick says"
6669,BY SALOME.,there’ll be always war s’long as there’s Injuns!”
6670,BY SALOME.,
6671,BY SALOME.,"“O! my little blue-eyed Dorr,” said mamma, “wouldn’t you care to be"
6672,BY SALOME.,scalped?”
6673,BY SALOME.,
6674,BY SALOME.,“Why’d I care?” answered Dorr. “Wouldn’t my ‘feet be to the foe’?”
6675,BY SALOME.,
6676,BY SALOME.,Mamma could not but laugh at her stern little man; and then she thought
6677,BY SALOME.,he had better go with the girls in the garden.
6678,BY SALOME.,
6679,BY SALOME.,And there he was not a moment too soon. The sacred inclosure was
6680,BY SALOME.,"already invaded by a ruthless hand--a fat, yellowish-black little hand,"
6681,BY SALOME.,"which was thrust through the paling, evidently after one of Soph’s"
6682,BY SALOME.,treasures--the beautiful rose-pink dwarf dahlia.
6683,BY SALOME.,
6684,BY SALOME.,Dorr saw it. “Soph! Soph! he’s breaking off your new Mex’can Lilliput
6685,BY SALOME.,"dahlia!” and headlong went Sergeant Dorr toward the fence; but, half"
6686,BY SALOME.,"way there, he tripped in the tall asters, and crushed dozens of mamma’s"
6687,BY SALOME.,choice autumn blooms as he fell.
6688,BY SALOME.,
6689,BY SALOME.,Soph and Trudie both came running down the gravel. The boy behind the
6690,BY SALOME.,"paling also ran, or would, had not the fat arm been thrust in too far;"
6691,BY SALOME.,"for, turning it in haste, it stuck fast, and now held him Sergeant"
6692,BY SALOME.,Dorr’s prisoner.
6693,BY SALOME.,
6694,BY SALOME.,"His fall had made Sergeant Dorr very mad; and, picking himself up, he"
6695,BY SALOME.,drove toward the paling in hot haste. “You flower-thief! them’s Soph’s
6696,BY SALOME.,"flowers! You clear out of this, or I’ll shoot you with my sword!”"
6697,BY SALOME.,
6698,BY SALOME.,"And the sword was brandished; and as Roly-poly couldn’t “clear out,”"
6699,BY SALOME.,"much as he wished, he staid, his hand still clasping the stalk of the"
6700,BY SALOME.,"“Mex’can Lilliput,” which he seemed unable to let go. Seeing that, down"
6701,BY SALOME.,"came Dorr’s wooden sword upon the arm! It was a sturdy stroke, too, so"
6702,BY SALOME.,"sturdy that the sword bounded and flew over on the other side, where an"
6703,BY SALOME.,"angry little bare black foot kicked it far out into the road, while the"
6704,BY SALOME.,owner of the foot howled with pain.
6705,BY SALOME.,
6706,BY SALOME.,“Dorr Eastman!” cried Trudie.
6707,BY SALOME.,
6708,BY SALOME.,"“You cruel, cruel boy!” cried Soph."
6709,BY SALOME.,
6710,BY SALOME.,"“He no bus’ness with your flowers, then!” said Dorr, crowding back an"
6711,BY SALOME.,angry whimper.
6712,BY SALOME.,
6713,BY SALOME.,"“I’ve a mind to shake you!” said Trudie. But, instead, she went to the"
6714,BY SALOME.,"fence where the little bow-legged mulatto, still howling, was trying to"
6715,BY SALOME.,get free.
6716,BY SALOME.,
6717,BY SALOME.,"“Little boy,” said she, “I’m sorry; but it is wrong to steal!”"
6718,BY SALOME.,
6719,BY SALOME.,"“But we done got no flowers of our own,” said he; “and besides, I"
6720,BY SALOME.,"hain’t broke it. O, dear, where’s mammy? I hain’t gooine to stay"
6721,BY SALOME.,hyer--don’t! don’t!” He howled louder than ever as Trudie took his arm.
6722,BY SALOME.,
6723,BY SALOME.,"“Hush up, simpleton! I’m only going to get you out.” With a firm grasp"
6724,BY SALOME.,"she turned his arm where he might draw it back. “There, I’ll let you"
6725,BY SALOME.,"out now, if you will stand still a moment after I let go.”"
6726,BY SALOME.,
6727,BY SALOME.,"The boy sobbed mightily, but stood still. “Stand there till I tell you"
6728,BY SALOME.,"to go,” commanded Trudie. Then she broke one of her own flowers for"
6729,BY SALOME.,"him, and also went into her pocket. “Hold your hand, now,” said she."
6730,BY SALOME.,
6731,BY SALOME.,"Sobbing, and with hidden face, the small ragamuffin held up his hand,"
6732,BY SALOME.,and Trudie poured into it a stream of pennies and candies. “The
6733,BY SALOME.,"flower,” said she, “is because you like pretty things. The rest is to"
6734,BY SALOME.,pay you for being struck.”
6735,BY SALOME.,
6736,BY SALOME.,The tawny little hand dashed the “pay” to the ground. “I can’t be paid
6737,BY SALOME.,"for being struck!” he cried, baring his tearful eyes, and gleaming with"
6738,BY SALOME.,them at the “sergeant.”
6739,BY SALOME.,
6740,BY SALOME.,"“What’s all this?” asked mamma, coming down the walk."
6741,BY SALOME.,
6742,BY SALOME.,"Hearing the story, she went outside, and bared the beaten arm. There"
6743,BY SALOME.,"was a frightful lump on the soft, black baby flesh. She looked up at"
6744,BY SALOME.,"her little soldier ruefully, and he ran off."
6745,BY SALOME.,
6746,BY SALOME.,"She took the child in, and bathed the bruise with camphor, picked him"
6747,BY SALOME.,"a gorgeous bouquet, and sent him home with various admonitions and"
6748,BY SALOME.,tendernesses. Then she waited for Dorr to come.
6749,BY SALOME.,
6750,BY SALOME.,"By and by he came. He was still without his sword. He rushed to her, as"
6751,BY SALOME.,"she turned at the sound of the little footstep, and tumbled into her"
6752,BY SALOME.,arms head first.
6753,BY SALOME.,
6754,BY SALOME.,"“Mamma,” he said, “I have martial-courted myself! I runned after him,"
6755,BY SALOME.,but he wouldn’t strike me. Then I thought what you said ’bout ‘kisses
6756,BY SALOME.,"for blows,’ but he wouldn’t kiss me; but I know’d there should be a"
6757,BY SALOME.,"kiss somewheres, ’cause ’twas your kind of a battle, not papa’s; so I"
6758,BY SALOME.,"gave him my sword, and asked him to come to play--and--well, mamma, I"
6759,BY SALOME.,haven’t got any sword no more!”
6760,BY SALOME.,
6761,BY SALOME.,"The little heart heaved; but mamma hugged him close, and shed a glad"
6762,BY SALOME.,tear to think her teaching had had its effect as well as papa’s.
6763,BY SALOME.,
6764,BY SALOME.,[Illustration: HE TUMBLED INTO HER ARMS HEAD FIRST.]
6765,BY SALOME.,
6766,BY SALOME.,"“My kind of battles are very hard, much harder to be fought than"

6825,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,she felt rather amused.
6826,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6827,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Bridget gave him a somewhat unfriendly stare as he entered the
6828,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,kitchen. She never could understand why a lady like Miss May should
6829,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,take fancies “to beggars and that sort of trash.” Dr. May looked rather
6830,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"serious about it, and wished her mother had lived, or that aunt Helen"
6831,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,knew how to interest her in other people. He saw quite enough of the
6832,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,misery and wretchedness of the world without having his pretty young
6833,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,daughter breaking her heart over it.
6834,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6835,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Come and warm yourself, Tim. Bridget, where are those cracked and"
6836,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,checked dishes and old tins I picked out the other day? And there are
6837,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"some chairs down cellar. O, and those old comfortables I laid away.”"
6838,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6839,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Sure, miss, I was goin’ to ask you if I mightn’t give the dishes to my"
6840,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"cousin, Ann Flynn, who is to be married on Sunday night. They’d be a"
6841,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,godsend to her.”
6842,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6843,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“We’ll divide them;” and Miss May smiled.
6844,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6845,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Bridget very unwillingly opened the closet door. The idea of giving
6846,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,china dishes to a beggar! She grudged everything that could go to a
6847,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“cousin.”
6848,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6849,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Miss May picked out two cups and saucers, four plates, two bowls, and"
6850,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"several miscellaneous articles, including a block-tin tea-pot and two"
6851,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,or three dilapidated tin pails.
6852,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6853,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Miss May! Why, we’ll feel as grand as kings!” and the eyes were"
6854,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,lustrous with gratitude.
6855,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6856,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Here’s a basket to pack them in. Bridget, give him a little tea and"
6857,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"sugar, and some of the cold meat left yesterday. I’ll run up stairs and"
6858,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,find some bed-clothes.”
6859,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6860,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"She came back laden. Tim’s face glowed to its utmost capacity, which"
6861,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"was large, seeing that he had been out in the cold all the morning."
6862,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6863,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“There, I haven’t any table, but all these will help. You are sure your"
6864,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"partner, as you call him, is a trusty fellow?”"
6865,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6866,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“He’s good as gold, though he hain’t no legs worth speakin’ of. He used"
6867,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"to sell papers on the cars, but he stumbled one day, ’nd had one cut"
6868,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"off, and t’other hurt. His father used to keep him round beggin’, but"
6869,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,he’s bound to have nice times now along o’ me. If you could hear him
6870,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"sing, Miss May--it’s like a bird hangin’ out a winder. When the weather"
6871,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"comes warm he kin sell apples and flowers, and sich. I’ll have a little"
6872,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,spare capital bimeby to start him with. An’ it’ll be next to havin’
6873,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"folks of one’s very own. I never had any, you see. Not that I’d want a"
6874,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"father like Jerry’s. Poor little chap, he’s had rough times, what with"
6875,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,the beatin’ and the starvin’.”
6876,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6877,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Miss May winked a tear out of her blue eyes. How ready these street
6878,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Arabs were to stand by one another! Would anybody in her “set” take in
6879,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,a poor brother unhesitatingly?
6880,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6881,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim was grateful from the very depths of his soul, and it was no mean"
6882,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"one. He bundled the articles in a great pack, and shouldered them,"
6883,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"chairs and all, and drew his rough sleeve across his eyes, while his"
6884,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,good-bye had a very husky sound.
6885,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6886,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,If Miss May could have heard the rejoicing!
6887,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6888,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"And yet it was a miserable little room, up three flights of stairs,"
6889,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,with only one window looking into a rear house. Their bedstead had been
6890,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"made of dry goods boxes, and when they covered it with her clean chintz"
6891,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"comfortable, and arrayed their closet shelves with the dishes, leaving"
6892,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"the door open so they could feast their eyes on their new possessions,"
6893,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,they could not resist giving three cheers; and Tim was actually coaxed
6894,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"into dancing a breakdown, while Jerry clapped “Finnegan’s Wake” with"
6895,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,his thin hands on the one good knee he had left. It was a blustering
6896,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"March day, but they two had a delightfully warm room and a feast. What"
6897,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,amused them most of all was beautiful Miss May’s idea that Tim was
6898,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,going to be married.
6899,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6900,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Tim,” said Jerry solemnly, when their laugh had ended, “I don’t know"
6901,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"how girls feel about such poor cripples as you and me, but my opinion"
6902,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,is that my mammy would have been glad enough to had a husband with the
6903,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"great, tender heart you’ve got. Poor mammy! I’m glad she’s in heaven"
6904,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"along of the angels, and I’m glad she don’t know about my legs. God"
6905,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"wouldn’t tell her when she was so happy--would He, Tim?”"
6906,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6907,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“No, He wouldn’t,” said Tim over a great lump in his throat."
6908,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6909,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,There never were such happy days in the life of either as those that
6910,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"followed. Jerry cooked, kept accounts, washed, ironed, and mended,"
6911,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,and as the days grew warmer began to do quite a thriving business in
6912,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"button-hole bouquets, standing on the corner as the men went up town."
6913,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Now and then he sold popular photographs on commission, or a lot of"
6914,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,choice bananas.
6915,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6916,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim was brisk and active, and caught up all manner of odd jobs. Now and"
6917,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,then he saw Miss May. Once he sent Jerry with a bouquet of flowers.
6918,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6919,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“I wanted you to see him, Miss May,” he said afterward, hanging around"
6920,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"until he caught sight of her. “He don’t look pale and peaked, as he did"
6921,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"when we first set up. It’s good livin’, you see, and no beatin’s. And"
6922,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,we have just the jolliest times you ever heard of. He don’t want me to
6923,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,call him anything but pardner. I do believe that ere little chap would
6924,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,give his life for me.”
6925,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6926,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Tim, how good you are!” she cried. “You shame richer and wiser"
6927,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,people. It is very noble to take that poor little boy by the hand and
6928,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,love and protect him.”
6929,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6930,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Noble!” echoed Tim, pulling his forelock and coloring through the tan"
6931,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"and grime. “Why, Miss May, he’s a sight of help and comfort to me;"
6932,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"better’n any wife would be, ’cause, you see, no woman who’d take me"
6933,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,ever’d be half so good.”
6934,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6935,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Tim,” she said, opening her dainty Russia leather pocket-book, “I want"
6936,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"to add a little mite to your happiness. I am going to the country soon,"
6937,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"for the whole summer. I want you to take this, and spend it just as I"
6938,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,tell you. You and Jerry must go on some nice excursion; there will be
6939,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"plenty of them presently. Get a good dinner, and take all the delight"
6940,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"you can, and remember to tell me all about it afterward.”"
6941,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6942,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Miss May, you are too good for anybody’s folks! Indeed, I’ll tell"
6943,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,you every word. And can I come again next winter to shovel snow and do
6944,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,chores?”
6945,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6946,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Yes, indeed. I shall be glad to have you. God bless you and your"
6947,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"partner, poor, brave little soul. I shall think of you often.”"
6948,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6949,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“I never see an angel ’xcept the ones in the picters with wings, but I"
6950,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"know Miss May is one,” said Tim to himself."
6951,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6952,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Tim and his partner counted their money that night. Business had been
6953,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,flourishing of late.
6954,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6955,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“There’s twenty-one dollars that we’ve saved up free and clear, and the"
6956,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"lady’s five. Tim, you had better put it in the bank;” and Jerry’s eyes"
6957,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,sparkled feverishly.
6958,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6959,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“I’d have to hide the bank book then;” and Tim chuckled. “Think of
6960,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"havin’ a bank account! Why, we’d feel a’most like Astor, or the old"
6961,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Commodore.”
6962,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6963,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“But I wish you would, Tim. I’m afraid to have so much in the house."
6964,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,It will be something against winter when business is dull. Now we’re
6965,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"making plenty to live on. Won’t you, Tim?”"
6966,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6967,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“To be sure I will--to-morrow. And we’ll hide the book in that same
6968,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,chink in the floor. No one would think of looking there. And we’ll have
6969,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"a rousin’ time on some ’xcursion. We’ll choose one with a brass band,"
6970,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,and have a little dance in one corner by ourselves. There isn’t the
6971,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,beat of Miss May in this whole world.”
6972,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6973,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“She’s good, but then she’s rich, you know. Five dollars doesn’t look"
6974,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"so large to her as it does to you and me. But, Tim, I love you better"
6975,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,than a hundred Miss Mays.”
6976,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6977,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim chuckled and winked hard, but said never a word."
6978,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6979,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"He was off early in the morning, as he had an important job on hand."
6980,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Jerry would have dinner all ready at noon, and he would put on his"
6981,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“store clothes” and go down to the bank like any other swell. My eyes!
6982,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Weren’t they in clover?
6983,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6984,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Tim could not get home until three; but he had earned two dollars since
6985,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"morning. They each had a key to the door, and finding it locked, Tim"
6986,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,drew out his. Jerry had gone to business; afternoons were his time.
6987,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,There was no dinner set out on the table and covered with a napkin. A
6988,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,curious chill of something like neglect went to Tim’s warm heart; but
6989,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"he whistled it away, found a bite of cold meat and some oatmeal. Then"
6990,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,he decided he would run over on Broadway and tell Jerry of his good
6991,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,luck. It was too late to think of going to the bank.
6992,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6993,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"No little chap sat on the well-known corner. Tim walked up a block,"
6994,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"down again, and studied the cross street sharply. Had he sold out and"
6995,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,gone home? Or may be he had taken the money to the bank! Tim ran home
6996,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"again. Yes, that was it. The money was gone."
6997,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
6998,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,He waited and waited. Somehow he did not feel a bit jolly; but he
6999,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,boiled the kettle and laid the supper. No Jerry yet. What had become of
7000,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,him? Had he put on his best suit?
7001,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7002,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"They had made a clothes-press out of a dry goods box, and Tim went to"
7003,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"inspect it. Why--Jerry’s shelf was entirely empty. Shirts, stockings,"
7004,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"yes, everything, even to his old every-day suit, gone. Tim dropped on"
7005,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"the floor, and hid his face in his hands. Had Jerry--"
7006,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7007,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"It was funny, but Tim squared off and gave the box a thump that bruised"
7008,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,his knuckles. It seemed to him that the box had breathed a suspicion
7009,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"that Jerry had stolen the money and run away. Then he kicked it, and"
7010,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"sat down and cried as if his heart would break. His pardner, little"
7011,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Jerry, a thief! No, he would never, never believe it."
7012,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7013,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"He sat up till midnight, and it seemed to him there had never been such"
7014,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,loneliness since the world began. Then the next morning he made some
7015,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,inquiries. Their two nearest neighbors were washerwomen. Both had been
7016,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,out all day. No one had seen Jerry.
7017,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7018,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,If Jerry’s father were not in prison--but he had been sent up in
7019,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"February for a year, and here it was only the last of June. Or if there"
7020,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,had been any evil companions hanging around; but Jerry and every scrap
7021,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"of his belongings, as well as the money, had surely disappeared."
7022,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7023,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"There was no gay excursion for Tim. He brooded over his desertion, and"
7024,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"grew morose, began to save his money again, and shut himself up like"
7025,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"a hermit. The poor, crippled boy that he had taken to his heart, that"
7026,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,he had warmed and fed! Ah! it was very bitter. Perhaps not even his
7027,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,beautiful Miss May would care to remember him.
7028,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7029,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,So he did not go near her. Autumn came on apace. One dreary November
7030,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"day, when he could find nothing to do, he turned homeward, weary and"
7031,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"heart-sick. Ah, if there was only a cheery voice to welcome him!"
7032,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7033,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Some one stood by his door, a lady in dainty attire. Some one caught"
7034,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"his arm, and cried,--"
7035,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7036,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Tim, I’m so glad you have come! I have been waiting almost an hour."
7037,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim, I’ve found little Jerry, and he is dying; but he asks for you"
7038,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,constantly. Come right away. Don’t lose a moment.”
7039,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7040,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Jerry!” in a sort of dazed way, as if he but half understood. “Little"
7041,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Jerry--my pardner? O, Miss May--no, you can’t mean it--dying?”"
7042,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7043,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Yes. Hurry, Tim. I’ve waited so long already!”"
7044,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7045,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"They walked down the stairs, scudded through the streets to a horse"
7046,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"car. It seemed to Tim as if they rode an hour. Then they alighted, and"
7047,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,a short walk brought them to a decent looking tenement house. Up one
7048,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"flight of stairs, and the door opened."
7049,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7050,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“Is it Tim?” asked a weak voice.
7051,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7052,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim threw himself on his knees by the bedside, and kissed the sweet,"
7053,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,wan face with the tenderness of a mother. For some minutes only sobs
7054,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,were heard.
7055,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7056,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“You told him, Miss May?”"
7057,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7058,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“No, Jerry. We hurried so there was no chance. But I will tell him"
7059,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,every word.”
7060,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7061,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Tim, you didn’t think I was a thief? It broke my heart to go. It"
7062,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"was father. He got out some way, and had been watching us. He came that"
7063,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"night when we were so happy counting our money, but he didn’t dare"
7064,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"offer to take me away then. The next morning he walked in with a paper,"
7065,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"which he said was a warrant for me, and that if I dared to say a word"
7066,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,he’d send me to the Refuge. I picked up my things--I was so afraid of
7067,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"him--and then he wanted the money, and swore if I didn’t get it he’d"
7068,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,murder me. I told him I wouldn’t; so he tied my hands and bound my
7069,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"mouth, lest I should scream, and then he hunted everywhere; and O, Tim,"
7070,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"he found it! He took me right out of the city with him to a vile den,"
7071,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,where they wanted to make a thief of me.”
7072,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7073,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Jerry, dear, don’t talk; it takes away all your strength. God knows"
7074,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,I never could have a hard thought of you now;” and Tim broke down.
7075,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7076,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“Just a little. I couldn’t get back to you. They watched me, and beat"
7077,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,me until I was sore and stiff; and there I staid until only a fortnight
7078,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"ago, when one night I gave them the slip. I wanted to come back and"
7079,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"tell you how it was, but the way was so far, and I was so tired, so"
7080,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"tired! Then I fell down in the street, and a good woman picked me up"
7081,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"and brought me in here, where it’s so nice and clean, Tim, and such a"
7082,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,quiet place to die in! And then I don’t seem to remember much until
7083,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"yesterday, when Miss May came in, and this morning, when she brought"
7084,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"her father. And then I wanted to see you, to tell you--Tim, if I could"
7085,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"live and earn the money--you were so good to me--so good. Tim, if you"
7086,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,could hold me in your arms again! Miss May said I would find mammy in
7087,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"heaven; that God cared for poor little boys. Does He, Tim? I like you"
7088,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,to tell me. And will you come and let me be your pardner again? Is it
7089,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"very far? Kiss me, Tim. You know now I wasn’t a thief. Miss May sang"
7090,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,something yesterday about opening the starry gates--”
7091,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7092,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“At the portals Jesus waits;
7093,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"All the heavenly host, begin;"
7094,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Open wide the starry gates,"
7095,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Let the little traveller in,”"
7096,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7097,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,sang the sweet voice over a tremulous sob.
7098,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7099,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Closer clung the thin arms, and the cool cheek was pressed against"
7100,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Tim’s, hot with burning tears. The little hands that had kept their"
7101,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"house tidy, and prepared the simple meals, lay limp and useless. The"
7102,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"eyes could not see any more, but the lips smiled and murmured a few"
7103,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"incoherent words, soft, sweet, and then an awesome silence. The little"
7104,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,waif Jerry had gone over the river.
7105,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7106,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Miss May,” cried Tim, “they _will_ take him in--won’t they? For,"
7107,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"you see, the poor little chap didn’t have a square chance in this"
7108,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"world! He’s been kicked and cuffed about, and had to go on crutches,"
7109,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"an’ been half starved many a time, but he wouldn’t lie nor steal for"
7110,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"all that. He ought to be happy somewheres. O, Jerry! Jerry! I loved you"
7111,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,so! And you was true to the last!”
7112,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7113,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“They will take him in,” Miss May says, with solemn tenderness. And"
7114,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"presently she unclasps the arms that are wound around Jerry’s neck,"
7115,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"lays the poor hands straight, and leads Tim over by the window. He"
7116,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"looks at her with dumb, questioning eyes, as if he would fain have her"
7117,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,fathom the mystery that he knows so little about. She brushes away some

7119,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7120,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,Presently Tim comes back and kisses the cold lips and stares at the
7121,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,strange beauty overspreading the wan face.
7122,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7123,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“O, Miss May,” he cries, “do you suppose I could ever earn enough to"
7124,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"pay for his being buried in some country place, where there’d be a few"
7125,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,flowers and a tree growing over him? I’d work all my life long. For
7126,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,he’d like it so. I can’t bear to think of having him carried away--”
7127,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7128,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"“No,” she says, with a shiver. “I will see about it, Tim.” Then she"
7129,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"gives a few orders to the woman, and goes away, leaving Tim with his"
7130,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,“pardner.”
7131,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,
7132,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"Dr. May shook his head at his daughter at first, and said it was folly;"
7133,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"but two days after he had him buried in a pretty rural cemetery, with a"
7134,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,white marble slab above his head containing two words--“Tim’s Partner.”
7135,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"And Tim, who takes care of the doctor’s horse now, and does odd chores,"
7136,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,"pauses occasionally and says to Miss May, “There never can be anybody"
7137,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,quite like Jerry to me again. Over in the other country we’ll be
7138,BY AMANDA M. DOUGLAS.,pardners forever.”

7152,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,little lighter.”
7153,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7154,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"The same was uttered by a pair of cherry lips, opening below a pair of"
7155,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"laughing eyes, which were parted from the cherry lips by a cherry nose."
7156,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,The nose was cherry because it stuck out from the face so round and
7157,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"plump that the sun, which had been around painting cherries just this"
7158,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"time of the year, threw a glance at it and said, “There’s another!” and"
7159,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,gave it a good strong stroke with his brush. This little accident made
7160,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the whole face look funny; for, like most people who do their work in a"
7161,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"hurry, the sun had dipped up so much paint, and dashed it at the nose"
7162,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"so carelessly, that it had hit ever so many other places--a spot on the"
7163,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"chin, a daub on the cheeks, and a streak on the forehead."
7164,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7165,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,Now there is some excuse for the sun; for while everybody knows that
7166,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,boys never will stand still long enough to have their faces properly
7167,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"attended to, everybody, little and big, and not only that, but every"
7168,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"tree and flower and blade of grass, keeps dancing and whirling about,"
7169,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,while the sun is trying to fix it.
7170,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7171,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,The result is just what you would expect--apples with one red cheek and
7172,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"one white one, blackberries with three colors on the same stem, so that"
7173,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the boys can always quote the old riddle, “blackberries are red when"
7174,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"they’re green,” and cherries that make half your pail-full, “not fit to"
7175,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"eat,” according to your mother, and speckled little fellows, just like"
7176,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,this one.
7177,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7178,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,On this particular morning there was great excitement in the towzley
7179,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,head that popped up to make the lucid remark above quoted. His big
7180,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,sister did not dream that little Wide Awake took it all literally when
7181,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"she said, “Don’t get up the first time the rooster crows.”"
7182,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7183,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"She forgot that childhood’s sweetest trait is trust, and she was"
7184,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,startled to remember it when she heard the precious little fellow’s
7185,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,sweet voice twitter out in the faint dawn:
7186,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7187,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Et, ittie ootie, I dettie ut ’en it det e ittie iter.”"
7188,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7189,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,Long before the sun had fairly got his paints mixed for another dash at
7190,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the fruit and the children, Strut crowed again."
7191,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7192,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Was Wide Awake asleep? Asleep, indeed! Up went the head again, and this"
7193,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"time two flying heels followed, and the bright voice sang again:"
7194,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7195,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“’E ootie c’ows, an’ _a’aw_ ’e do’s.”"
7196,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7197,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,He meant to say:
7198,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7199,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“The rooster crows, and away he goes,” meaning his little self."
7200,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7201,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Little brother, it isn’t time to get up for an hour. Hop into bed"
7202,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"again,” called out Sister Laura."
7203,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7204,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“’Ou ed e _’econ’_ tine,” said a sorrowful, drooping little voice."
7205,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7206,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Go to sleep--that’s a good boy!” was the answer, and Laura set the"
7207,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,copy for him by going off instantly herself.
7208,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7209,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"But Wide Awake had not won his name without deserving it, and he passed"
7210,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,a long and lonesome hour trying to amuse himself with nothing.
7211,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7212,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Finally, dressing-time came. When he reached the kitchen, all was as"
7213,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,busy as a coming picnic could make it. Dinah was flying from cellar to
7214,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"pantry, and from pantry to oven. As soon as he got to the back stairs"
7215,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"door-way, Wide Awake spied something wrong high up on Dinah’s back."
7216,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7217,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Attieilly on ou olly,” he cried out."
7218,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7219,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Keep still, Allie; don’t boffer me screaming,” said Dinah."
7220,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7221,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“_Attieilly on ou olly_,” said he, coming close to her, and pointing,"
7222,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,and pulling her dress.
7223,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7224,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Go ’long, I tell you!” said she. “I’ll tell your sister, and you won’t"
7225,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,get no cake.”
7226,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7227,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,Allie reluctantly stepped back a little; but he spoke volumes of
7228,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"anxiety, had any one been looking."
7229,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7230,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,No one was.
7231,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7232,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Oh! what’s dat on my neck?” screamed out Dinah, in a minute. “Oh-h-h!”"
7233,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7234,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Allie _tole_ Dine attieilly on ou olly,” said Allie, as Dinah’s cries"
7235,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"brought Laura, who picked off from Dinah’s neck an immense caterpillar,"
7236,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,which the patient little fellow had been compelled to watch in its
7237,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,upward journey from the shoulder where he first espied it.
7238,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7239,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"At length the preparations were fairly finished, the horses were at"
7240,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the door, Allie’s eyes were dancing almost out of his head with joy,"
7241,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the refreshments were all packed in, and, almost in the midst of the"
7242,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"baskets a stool was set for Allie, and his happy little self deposited"
7243,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"upon it. The rest were finally seated, and the picnickers move off for"
7244,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,Dudley’s woods.
7245,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7246,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Everybody talked and laughed together; and Allie sang to himself, with"
7247,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,no fear of being heard. Presently he seized an end of his sister’s
7248,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"shawl, and shouted with all his might:"
7249,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7250,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Doos, Laula, doos!”"
7251,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7252,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Yes, dear, Laula knows.”"
7253,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7254,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“_My_ doos, Laula! my _doos_ ober dare.”"
7255,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7256,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Yes, dear, never mind,” was the answer."
7257,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7258,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Ve’er min’ _doos_, Laula?” said the voice, anxiously."
7259,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7260,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“No, never mind, we’ll see another.”"
7261,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7262,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Where is the feather on your hat, child?” asked Laura, when they had"
7263,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,ridden two miles farther.
7264,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7265,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Doos _dawn_, Laula; ’ou ed no min’ my doos.”"
7266,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7267,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Dear me! that was what he called his feather,--his goose,” said she."
7268,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“I might have remembered.”
7269,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7270,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Laula, Allie’s feets feel ’et.”"
7271,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7272,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Wet, child? I guess not,” said Laura, and chatted on."
7273,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7274,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"They were nearing the woods as she spoke, and soon the loaded carriages"
7275,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,turned into a wood so uninviting and full of underbrush that you looked
7276,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,again all over the party to see if they appeared crazy from anything
7277,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,but gay spirits.
7278,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7279,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"No, they were sane, no doubt; and there must be an explanation for such"
7280,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"a choice. The explanation was, that it was not choice at all, it was"
7281,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"circumstance which guided them. Twenty-five years ago that very day,"
7282,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"a party of four young married people, with their older children, had"
7283,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"come to this wood to pick blackberries, which grew in great abundance"
7284,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,upon its borders. It was half a frolic; but still it was no accident
7285,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,that sent them home with forty shining black quarts to enjoy by their
7286,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"firesides. The next year they went again, and the next, and the next;"
7287,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"and every year the company grew larger. But, strange to say, as it grew"
7288,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"larger the quarts grew smaller, and finally, somehow or other, “the"
7289,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,blackberries are not worth picking this year;” or “the blackberries
7290,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"are all dried up this year,” became the continual complaint when the"
7291,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,excursionists returned home with emptier and emptier baskets.
7292,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7293,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,But the “Blackberry Party” grew as thick as its namesake fruit had been
7294,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"of old, and now, for twenty-five years, fathers and mothers, sons and"
7295,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"daughters, grandchildren and neighbors, gathered to the time-honored"
7296,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"festival. To be sure, every year more of the elders stayed behind,"
7297,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"because they missed one and another who were there “last year,” and"
7298,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,life’s merriment was checked for them forever until they should follow.
7299,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7300,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"But new ones had come to take the lead, and the merry scenes went on in"
7301,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,the gnarled old forest. It was a strange fact that in all these years
7302,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,the day on which the picnic occurred had never been stormy. A glorious
7303,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"succession of bright days had spanned the quarter of a century, and it"
7304,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,was taken as a sign that heaven smiled peculiarly upon the innocent joy
7305,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,which the day was sure to bring.
7306,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7307,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"This was the quarter centennial, and the procession had picked up"
7308,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"little Allie, as “big enough to go this year.” And so little Allie was"
7309,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"very happy, although, in spite of Sister Laura’s assurance, he _did_"
7310,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,think that his feet were “’et.”
7311,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7312,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Laura thought so too, in a minute; for she lifted a can that had once"
7313,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"held six quarts from the “morning’s milking,” and found “only a stingy"
7314,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"little pint or so,” left."
7315,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7316,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Allie’s feet _us_ ’et, Laula,” said the voice, which did not dream"
7317,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,that it sounded like the silver trumpet of an unheeded angel.
7318,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7319,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Fisk an’ Tarlo ginkin auty, Laula,” said Allie once more."
7320,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7321,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Carlo naughty! drive him away. But he won’t bite Allie.”
7322,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7323,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“No, _’e bite auty_, ’pring auty.”"
7324,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7325,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Never mind,--he won’t hurt you. Carlo is a good doggie.”"
7326,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7327,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Go ’way, there! What are you doing, you scamps! I declare! Frisk and"
7328,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,Carlo have been drinking half that spring water!”
7329,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7330,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Allie tole Laula.”
7331,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7332,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,But Laula was bemoaning the loss; for the spring was almost a mile
7333,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"away, and this wood was provided with no modern conveniences."
7334,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7335,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"The cask of ice-water was too precious to be used for cooking purposes,"
7336,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,and away trudged the youths for another bucket-full.
7337,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7338,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,This weakened the effective force of the dinner getters materially;
7339,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"for, under the pretense of picking the traditional blackberries, nearly"
7340,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"all the party, in couples or in groups, had strayed off to parts"
7341,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"unseen. The remaining ones were lighting a lively fire, and going"
7342,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"through various manœuvres before it, and a certain odor therefrom said"
7343,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"plainly, “You don’t often get better coffee than I come from.”"
7344,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7345,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Allie, meantime, was roaming about unnoticed. He gained an immense"
7346,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,amount of information in this leisure hour.
7347,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7348,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Presently Laura called out, “I have got the lemons ready; bring me that"
7349,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,box of sugar.”
7350,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7351,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"The box was brought, a ten-pound one, and full to the brim."
7352,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7353,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Laula, don’ pu’ dat! Dat au ’alt, Laula!”"
7354,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7355,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Allie doesn’t like to see his pet sugar thrown away in such a big
7356,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"hole,” said she, gayly, as she emptied the box into the oaken cask."
7357,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Run for the ice-water, I hear them coming from all directions.”"
7358,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7359,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Great white lumps of ice, pure cold water,--in they went, and Laura"
7360,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,stirred violently with her monstrous ladle.
7361,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7362,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Allie shall have the first taste,” said she, “to show him that his"
7363,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,dear sugar is not wasted.”
7364,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7365,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Allie don’ wan’! Allie know e au ’alt.”
7366,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7367,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“All spoilt? No, dear, just see how nice it is!”"
7368,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7369,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Laula pu’ in ’_alt_,” said he, again. “Laula ta’!”"
7370,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7371,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Laula did “ta’,” then; and she dropped the cup with a scream of horror."
7372,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"For, besides the fact that ten pounds of salt in any combination do not"
7373,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"help to make either a refreshing or a thirst-allaying drink, here were"
7374,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"five dozen fine lemons, and many quarts of ice-water, a hopeless loss."
7375,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7376,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“How could that stupid Dinah bring the salt instead of the sugar?” she
7377,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"muttered, as soon as vexation would allow her to speak at all."
7378,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7379,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"One by one the party dropped in, and the first cry was for lemonade,"
7380,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Laura’s famous manufacture.” More famous than it ever had been it
7381,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"became immediately, and, amid the general din of exclamations no one"
7382,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,heard Allie say:
7383,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7384,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Allie knew. Allie _tole_ Laula ’bout _’alt_!”
7385,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7386,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Then was felt, with greater cruelty, the absence of milk for the"
7387,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"fragrant coffee; and the delicious cake, and sandwiches, and ham, and"
7388,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"turkey, and tarts, and pastry, were but half enjoyed."
7389,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7390,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"It was with a heavy heart that poor Laura packed up the dishes, and"
7391,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"laid away more untouched food, than usual."
7392,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7393,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,A row of lemon and berry pies had been set upon one of the benches; and
7394,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"somebody, to keep the insects out, had thrown a table-cloth upon them."
7395,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"Along came two lovers, whose visions were only fairy-like, and who were"
7396,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,in that state of mind when it made no difference where they rested or
7397,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"went, so that they rested or went together. With their eyes entirely"
7398,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"occupied in gazing at one another, they wandered up to the temporary"
7399,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,cupboard.
7400,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7401,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,A little voice close by fairly screamed out:
7402,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7403,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,“Don’ ’it on ’e bys! Don’t ’it on ’e bys!”
7404,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7405,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"A vague smile into his earnest face was all the reply he received, and"
7406,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"down sat the pair, too full of a fond trust in themselves to remember"
7407,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,to doubt anything created.
7408,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7409,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Oh! oh! oh! oh!” resounded all about them, and an instant later their"
7410,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"own “oh” mingled in the chorus, as the groan of broken crockery rose on"
7411,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"the air, and table-cloth and drapery were pronounced a ruin."
7412,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7413,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“’Ou ’at wite on ’e bys,” said a voice which was not needed to confirm"
7414,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,the fact.
7415,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7416,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,At length the light of the twenty-fifth glorious day began to steal in
7417,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,long darting lines among the foliage that had been a shelter from its
7418,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"rays all day. As the company assembled, it was found to have been an"
7419,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"unusually bad year for blackberries, though why it should have been the"
7420,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,most imaginative did not venture to suggest.
7421,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7422,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,As they started homeward Laura said:
7423,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7424,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Now sit right still, Allie, for fear you should fall out, for we shall"
7425,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,go very fast indeed.”
7426,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7427,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"There was little need for the warning, as Allie was well wedged down in"
7428,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"front, and well wrapped up in an extra shawl of Laura’s, because she"
7429,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,forgot to bring his little overcoat.
7430,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7431,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"But by-and-by the whip worked quietly out of its broken holder, and no"
7432,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"eyes but the two bright, observant eyes in the littlest head saw that"
7433,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,in a minute it must fall.
7434,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7435,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"The little fellow tried to dart forward, but the great shawl held him"
7436,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,too securely.
7437,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,
7438,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"“Sit still, Allie,” said Laura."

7448,BY HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON.,"The long procession halted, wondering what had happened to the first"

7477,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BABY.,
7478,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.
7479,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7480,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7481,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,The Tutchy children were all mad.
7482,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7483,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"I don’t mean they had lost their senses and required strait-jackets,"
7484,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,but they certainly did need something to smooth the frowns from their
7485,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,brows and the pouts from their lips.
7486,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7487,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,The Tutchy children were pretty children--when they weren’t mad--with
7488,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"bright blue eyes, much the color of some of their grandmother’s"
7489,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"centennial dinner-plates, and auburn hair that looked as though it"
7490,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"would, on the slightest provocation, turn red."
7491,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7492,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"There were nine of them, Susie, Willie, Robbie, Lizzie, Nellie, Annie,"
7493,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Sallie, Maud and Baby."
7494,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7495,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Quite enough for such a little woman as Mrs. Tutchy to look after.
7496,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7497,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Captain Tutchy was away--he was away about half the time with his ship
7498,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“The Treasure”--named, he said, after his wife--and Mrs. Tutchy had"
7499,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,just received a letter from him saying he could not be home for the
7500,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Christmas holidays, and so the children must wait for their presents"
7501,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"and their party until he came, “and you may expect me, my dear,” the"
7502,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"letter ended, “the second day of the New Year.”"
7503,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7504,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,And this is why the Tutchy children were mad.
7505,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7506,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"They said nothing until mamma, hearing baby cry, went out of the room."
7507,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Then they began:
7508,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7509,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“What will Christmas be without papa?” said Lizzie. “Who’s to laugh,"
7510,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,I’d like to know? Papa does most of the laughing.”
7511,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7512,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“I shan’t, for one!” said Willie."
7513,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7514,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Nor I,” said Robbie."
7515,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7516,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“There won’t be a bit of fun getting up early on Christmas morning,”"
7517,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"said Nellie. “No boxes to open, and no stockings to empty!”"
7518,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7519,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“_I’ll_ not hang up my stocking, and I’ll not get up early, either--so"
7520,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,there now!” said Annie.
7521,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7522,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Why? won’t Santa Claus come at all?” asked Sallie and Maud, in one"
7523,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,breath.
7524,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7525,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Yes, I s’pose he’ll come,” answered Annie, “but he won’t bring such"
7526,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"nice things as he does when papa’s home. He’s a very, very old friend"
7527,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,of papa’s.”
7528,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7529,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“No party! Just think of it!” said Susie. “’Twon’t seem like Christmas.”
7530,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7531,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“And the captain,” said Robbie, who was fond of giving the captain his"
7532,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"title, “isn’t coming back till the day school begins. He never did such"
7533,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"a thing before, and _I_ think it’s real mean!”"
7534,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7535,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“Great old holidays!” said Lizzie.
7536,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7537,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“_I’m_ mad!” said Susie, who, by-the-by, was the eldest of them all."
7538,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7539,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“So are we all of us!” said the others in chorus.
7540,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7541,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Just then Mrs. Tutchy came into the room with Baby in her arms, and in"
7542,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Baby’s arms was a funny, broken-nosed doll."
7543,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7544,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Baby was the sweetest, dearest little thing that ever played"
7545,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“patty-cake” or said “goo.”
7546,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7547,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Her eyes were so blue that you thought of violets, blue-bells, and"
7548,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"summer skies, the moment you saw them, and then gave it up, for there"
7549,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"was nothing quite as blue as they were, and her silken hair lay all"
7550,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"over her pretty, round head in tiny rings just the size and color of"
7551,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,mamma’s wedding-ring.
7552,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7553,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Mrs. Tutchy looked both surprised and sad when she saw eight frowns and
7554,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"pouts--perhaps I should say seven, as wee Maud’s almost disappeared"
7555,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,when she looked up at her mother--instead of eight smiles.
7556,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7557,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"But she pretended not to notice the sixteen unlovely things, and said,"
7558,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"in a pleasant voice, “Baby is ready for a ride. I have wrapped her up"
7559,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"warmly. Get her hood, Susie, and, Willie and Robbie, fasten her little"
7560,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,wagon on your new sled. You may all go for a walk--I don’t remember
7561,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,such a fine 24th of December for years--but I shall expect you home in
7562,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"an hour, and whatever you do, take good care of Baby.”"
7563,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7564,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Now if the Tutchy children had not been mad they would have jumped up
7565,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,and down and shouted and half-smothered Baby with hugs and kisses; but
7566,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"being mad, they went silently about--their silence, to tell the truth,"
7567,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"would have been considered noise by a small, quiet family--preparing"
7568,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,for their walk.
7569,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7570,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"And when they were ready, if Maud had not set them the example, they"
7571,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,would have actually forgotten to kiss mamma “good-by.” Dear me! how mad
7572,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,they were!
7573,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7574,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Off they started in a funereal manner, Susie and Maud ahead, the other"
7575,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"girls following two by two, and the boys dragging Baby, still holding"
7576,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"the broken-nosed doll, in her little wagon on the sled, bringing up the"
7577,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,rear.
7578,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7579,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,Baby crowed and cooed and prattled to her dollie--there never was a
7580,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,jollier baby in the whole world--but still Will and Bobbie frowned and
7581,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,pouted.
7582,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7583,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“I wish we didn’t have to lug Baby everywhere,” at last said Willie."
7584,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7585,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“So do I,” said Robbie."
7586,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7587,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"They had never thought, much less said such a thing before, but then"
7588,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,they had never been quite as mad before.
7589,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7590,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Suddenly the sound of a drum was heard, then the shrill blasts of horns"
7591,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"and the ear-piercing strains of a fife, and they could see a crowd"
7592,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,gathering in the distance.
7593,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7594,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Hurry up!” called Susie, who had remarkably sharp eyes, “there’s some"
7595,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"men on horseback dressed awful funny!” and away she ran, dragging Maud"
7596,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"by the hand, and away went Nellie, Lizzie, Annie and Sallie after her"
7597,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,as fast as they could go.
7598,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7599,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“We can’t run with Baby,” said Willie, “and we’ll miss all the fun!”"
7600,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7601,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Too bad!” said Robbie, with two frowns rolled into one. “But I say,"
7602,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Will, let’s go anyhow.”"
7603,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7604,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Pshaw! there won’t be anything to see by the time _we_ get there,”"
7605,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,said Will.
7606,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7607,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“I don’t mean to take Baby,” said Robbie. “We’ll leave her by the door"
7608,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,of this empty house. Nothing can happen to her before we come back.”
7609,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7610,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“That’s so,” said Will, “we won’t be gone a minute;” and they lifted"
7611,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"the sled, wagon and all, up the two steps that led to the door, and,"
7612,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"before Baby knew what they were about, they were off."
7613,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7614,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"The other children were already two blocks away, but the boys soon"
7615,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"overtook them, and another block brought them to the spot where the"
7616,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,crowd was gathered.
7617,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7618,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"The frowns and pouts, for the time being, disappeared, and the Tutchys"
7619,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,laughed long and loud at the antics of the queer-looking figures who
7620,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"were parading about with a patch-work banner inscribed, “Old Original"
7621,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Santa Claus Guards,” when suddenly Susie turned around, and with"
7622,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,frightened eyes cried out:
7623,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7624,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Why Will,--Robbie, where’s Baby?”"
7625,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7626,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Will hung his head, but Robbie, assuming a careless air, replied:"
7627,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7628,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“The captain’s youngest daughter? O! she’s safe. We couldn’t bring her
7629,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"and run after you too, and so we left her.”"
7630,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7631,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"But Susie waited to hear no more. “Show me where!” she said, and they"
7632,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,all started back again on a much faster run than that with which they
7633,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,had followed “The Old Original Santa Claus Guards.”
7634,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7635,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,The “house to let” was quickly reached.
7636,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7637,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,No sled--no wagon--no broken-nosed doll--no BABY was there!
7638,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7639,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"And now indeed the frowns and pouts took flight, and tears and sobs"
7640,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,came in their stead.
7641,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7642,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“O dear! O dear!” cried the Tutchy children, “what shall we do?”"
7643,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7644,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Then they ran hither and thither, asking every one they met:"
7645,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7646,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“Have you seen a baby in a little wagon on a sled?”
7647,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7648,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“A beautiful baby, with blue eyes?”"
7649,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7650,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“A broken-nosed baby--O, no, no, no! a _lovely_ baby with a"
7651,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,broken-nosed doll?”
7652,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7653,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“A sweet baby, with golden curls?”"
7654,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7655,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“A baby named ‘Snow-drop’ and ‘Diamond’ and ‘Bird’ and ‘Plum’?”
7656,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7657,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"No one had seen her, and sadly the procession took up the line of march"
7658,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,for home.
7659,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7660,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"How they told their mamma they never knew, but when the tale was done"
7661,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"she gave one great gasp, and tore out of the house like a wild woman,"
7662,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"with no hat on her head, and nothing but a small shawl about her."
7663,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7664,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“I must go too,” said Susie, and she flew after the poor distracted"
7665,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"mother, while the seven other children sat down on the floor and cried."
7666,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7667,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“O! how wicked we have been,” said Lizzie, “to say that to-morrow"
7668,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"wouldn’t be a merry Christmas, when we had such a darling, beautiful"
7669,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,baby!”
7670,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7671,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“And dear papa coming home in a few days!” sobbed Nellie.
7672,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7673,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“And mamma so good and sweet!” said Sallie.
7674,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7675,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,“And all of us such very nice chilluns!” said Maud.
7676,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7677,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Willie and Robbie said nothing, but buried their faces in their hands,"
7678,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,and wept softly.
7679,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7680,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,[Illustration: “I SEE DIS YERE BABY A-SETTIN’ ON A SLED.”]
7681,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7682,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"The sun went down, and back came mamma and Susie, hollow-eyed and pale,"
7683,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,but no Baby.
7684,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7685,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Not one of the children thought of stockings, or presents, or parties,"
7686,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"or Christmas itself, that wretched Christmas Eve, but they clustered in"
7687,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"silence, real silence this time, about their mother, until one by one"
7688,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,they fell asleep.
7689,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7690,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"But Mrs. Tutchy sat with dry, wide-opened eyes, listening--listening"
7691,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"all night long, until the joyous morning chimes rang out upon the"
7692,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"clear, frosty air."
7693,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7694,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"As they ceased, the sharp ringing of the street door-bell echoed"
7695,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,through the quiet house.
7696,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7697,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Dropping wee Maud from her lap, where she had slept for several hours,"
7698,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"the poor little woman, her heart beating loud and fast, hastened with"
7699,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,trembling steps to the door and flung it open.
7700,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7701,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"There stood a tall, straight negro woman, with a gaudy turban on her"
7702,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"head, a small boy, much darker than herself, clinging to her skirts"
7703,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"with one hand, and yes--O, thanks to the good God--holding the rope of"
7704,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"the boys’ sled with the other, baby in her arms!"
7705,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7706,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Almost as wild with joy as she had been with sorrow, the mother"
7707,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"snatched her darling, and covered her with kisses."
7708,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7709,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Come in, come in,” she cried, in her old, pleasant voice, the tired"
7710,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"gone out of her face, and her eyes shining bright with happiness."
7711,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7712,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"Up jumped the Tutchy children from all corners of the room, and such a"
7713,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"hurrahing and shouting of “Merry Christmas,” and kissing of Baby never"

7715,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7716,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“An’ now, yo’ Abraham Ulysses, yo’ jess tell the lady yo’ information,”"
7717,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"said the woman to the grinning boy, pulling her dress out of his hand,"
7718,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,and pushing him forward.
7719,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7720,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Needn’t push so,” said Abraham Ulysses, rolling his eyes about in the"
7721,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"most wonderful manner for a moment, and then fixing them solemnly on"

7723,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,
7724,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“I war a-goin’ along, an’ da’ war a drum down da’--I’s goin’ to have a"

7764,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,of an eye Mary Ann Johnson was several dollars richer than when she
7765,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,entered the room.

7767,BY MAGARET EYTINGE.,"“Thank you a million of times!” repeated the children; and Will, after"

7795,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"little time to ourselves without a little snip like you taggin’ after,"
7796,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,an’ listenin’ to every word we say; so you go right straight back this
7797,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,minute!”
7798,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7799,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Little Effie Maylie Marsh (called “Ef May” for short) turned her round
7800,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"blue eyes for a moment full upon her sister, and then, without word"
7801,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"or sign, trotted composedly along in that sister’s wake, serenely"
7802,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,oblivious of the fact that she was the one too many in the little
7803,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"party that had started, joyful at the prospect of a whole afternoon’s"
7804,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"confidential chat, for the blackberry patch over the hill, when poor Ef"
7805,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,May as usual intruded her roly-poly presence just when she was least
7806,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,wanted.
7807,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7808,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Did Mother know that you came?”
7809,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7810,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Sister Anne looked and spoke with all the dignity that her twelve years
7811,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"was capable of, but the intruder never flinched."
7812,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7813,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Yes, she did. _I_ said lemme go pick blackberry with the other girls,"
7814,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,an’ _she_ said”--
7815,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7816,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“What?”
7817,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7818,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Yes, if they don’t pro_ject_.”"
7819,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7820,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Both girls laughed, for Ef May was famous for her conversational"
7821,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"blunders, and good-natured Lotty whispered under the shelter of her"
7822,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,sunbonnet:
7823,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7824,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Let her go, she won’t do any harm.”"
7825,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7826,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Yes she will. She’ll hear every single word we say and tell Gus of it
7827,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"just as quick as she gets home. _I_ know her, of old.”"
7828,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7829,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Poor Anne had had bitter experiences of her little sister’s quickness
7830,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"of hearing and equal quickness in repeating whatever she had heard, and"
7831,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,she was far too shrewd to trust her on this occasion. But how to get
7832,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"rid of the dear little nuisance--ah, that was the rub!"
7833,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7834,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“May,” she whispered mysteriously, and Ef May pricked up her ears and"
7835,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"looked curious. “If you’ll go home now, like a good girl, you shall"
7836,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"(put your ear closer, so Lotty won’t hear) go to _Mrs. White’s party_,"
7837,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,to-night.”
7838,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7839,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Ef May had often heard older people talk about parties, and in her"
7840,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"inquisitive little soul she had longed many a time, to know more about"
7841,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"them, and especially to see with her own eyes what they were like; and"
7842,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,now she stood with her great blue eyes wide open like a pair of very
7843,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"early morning glories, and a little flush of excitement deepened the"
7844,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"roses on her plump cheeks, as Anne continued in her most seductive"
7845,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,tones:
7846,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7847,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Now, run right along, there’s a darling! and I’ll get you ready, my"
7848,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"own self, and see that you have a”--"
7849,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7850,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Rockaway?” suggested Lotty, in a voice that sounded suspiciously"
7851,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"hoarse, to which Anne replied, with an air of lofty disdain that,--"
7852,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7853,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Ef May had outgrown such babyish ways long ago, and would go to the"
7854,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,party as other folks did.”
7855,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7856,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Ef May was a very old bird for one of her age, and this “chaff” between"
7857,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,the two girls did strike her as a little suspicious. Perhaps there was
7858,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"some hidden flaw in this magnificent offer, and jerking her little"
7859,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"yellow curly head one side like a shrewd canary, she fixed one round,"
7860,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,bright eye full upon her sister’s face as she asked solemnly:
7861,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7862,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Now, Anne Marsh,--‘honest an’ true, black an’ blue,’ can I go to Mrs."
7863,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"White’s party, this very night?”"
7864,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7865,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Yes, you shall, if I have to go with you myself.”"
7866,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7867,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Ef May was satisfied; even Lotty’s half suppressed giggle passed
7868,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"unobserved, and her face shone with happy anticipation as turning her"
7869,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,chubby feet homeward she smiled her parting salutation:
7870,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7871,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Good-by,--I’ll go home an’ _’repair_ myself for the party.”"
7872,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7873,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"The girls laughed, but Lotty said rather regretfully:"
7874,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7875,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“It was kinder too bad to _fool_ the little thing so. What will you say
7876,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,to her when night comes?”
7877,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7878,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Oh, I’ll coax her up, somehow--make her doll a new hat, maybe.”"
7879,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7880,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,And thus dismissing poor Ef May and her forthcoming disappointment from
7881,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"their minds the two girls walked gaily on, laughing and chatting in"
7882,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"their pleasant school-girl fashion, as they gathered the rich purple"
7883,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"berries, heedless of scratched hands and stained finger tips, while"
7884,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"they listened to the partridge drumming in the cedars overhead, or"
7885,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the social chatter of that provident little householder the squirrel,"
7886,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"who, perched upon some convenient bough out of possible reach of their"
7887,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"longing fingers, discoursed in the choicest squirrel language of his"
7888,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,way of preserving acorns and beechnuts by a receipt handed down from
7889,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,squirrel forefathers as far back as the days of Noah--a receipt that
7890,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,never had failed and never would.
7891,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7892,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"It was after sunset when, with full baskets and tired steps, they"
7893,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"walked up the lane that led to Anne’s home, both starting guiltily as"
7894,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,they caught sight of Ef May’s little figure seated in the doorway with
7895,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,her bowl of bread and milk and her blue eyes turned wistfully upon them
7896,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,as they came slowly up the clover-bordered path.
7897,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7898,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“I was in hopes she’d be asleep,” muttered Anne with an uncomfortable"
7899,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,feeling at the heart as she saw the joyfully significant nod with which
7900,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"her little sister greeted her, and hastily bestowing a generous handful"
7901,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"of the delicious fruit upon her, she said, with an effort to appear"
7902,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,natural and at ease:
7903,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7904,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“See what a lot of nice, ripe blackberries I brought you!”"
7905,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7906,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"The little girl smiled, but she shook her head with an air of happy"
7907,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,importance.
7908,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7909,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“I’ll put ’em away for my breakfast,” she whispered. “I must save my"
7910,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"appetite for _to-night_, you know.”"
7911,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7912,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Anne could have cried with a relish.
7913,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7914,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Oh, Ef May,” she began penitently, “I’m afraid I’ve done wrong in"
7915,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,telling you--”
7916,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7917,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Come, Anne! Come right in! Supper is waiting for you,” called their"
7918,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"mother, and the confession was postponed until they should be alone"
7919,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"again; but when that time came, and, after her usual custom Anne took"
7920,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the little one to her room to undress and put her to bed, the sight"
7921,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,of the child’s happy expectant face forced back the words that she
7922,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,would have spoken and made her feel that she could not yet confess the
7923,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,deception.
7924,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7925,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“You must curl my hair real pretty, now. I _do_ wish,” with a sigh,"
7926,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“that mamma would let me wear her _waterwig_.”
7927,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7928,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"And the bright eyes shone like stars, as she thus gave the signal for"
7929,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the preparations to commence; and Anne obeyed, patiently brushing out"
7930,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the tangled locks and curling them one by one over her fingers, while"
7931,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,she listened to the excited chatter of her little charge and vaguely
7932,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,wondered how long it would be possible for those dreadfully wide awake
7933,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"eyes to keep open. She was as long about her task as possible, but the"
7934,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the last curl was finished at last, and Effie asked eagerly:"
7935,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7936,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“What dress are you going to put on me?”
7937,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7938,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,By this time poor Anne was fairly desperate.
7939,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7940,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“I forgot to tell you,” she said with a sudden determination to carry"
7941,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"out the joke to the end, “that this is a queer party, something like"
7942,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the ‘sheet and pillow case balls,’ that you’ve heard of,--and everybody"
7943,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,goes to this in----in their nightgowns.”
7944,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7945,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Ef May looked up sharply.
7946,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7947,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“What’s that for?” she asked with a suspicious look at her sister’s
7948,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,guilty face.
7949,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7950,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Because--well, I guess its because its the fashion.”"
7951,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7952,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Ef May pondered the subject for a moment, and then her brow cleared:"
7953,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7954,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“I’ll wear my very bestest one, then, with the _tuckered out_ yoke an’"
7955,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"_Humbug_ trimming,” she said, complacently, “an’ my corals outside.”"
7956,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7957,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Anne obeyed without a word, and the little lady surveyed herself in the"
7958,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,glass with a smile of intense satisfaction.
7959,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7960,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Ain’t it most time to go?” she asked, and Anne detecting, as she"
7961,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"thought, just the ghost of a yawn in the tone, replied briskly:"
7962,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7963,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Oh no, not for some time yet. Come and sit in my lap,--there lay your"
7964,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"head on my shoulder, ea-sy, so as not to tumble the curls, and I’ll"
7965,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"sing, ‘Tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate,’ so you won’t get tired of"
7966,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,waiting you know.”

7969,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7970,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"The little girl was nothing loth to accept her sister’s offer, for in"
7971,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,spite of her exertions to keep herself awake the heavy eyelids would
7972,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"droop, the curly head press more heavily, and the lively, chattering"
7973,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,little tongue grow slower and more indistinct in its utterances until
7974,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,at last it was silent altogether; not even the tiniest line of blue
7975,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"parted the golden lashes, the dimples settled undisturbed into their"
7976,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,old places about the rosy mouth while only the faintest breath of a
7977,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,sigh answered to Anne’s good-night kiss as she softly laid her precious
7978,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"burden down among the snowy pillows of her own little bed, and stole"
7979,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"away, with the secret resolve in her heart that never again, by word"
7980,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"or act, would she deceive the innocent little sister who trusted so"
7981,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,implicitly in her truth and honor.

7984,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7985,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"It _was_ a funny party, and Ef May looked about her in astonishment"
7986,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"as a servant in dressing gown and night-cap, announced in a sleepy"
7987,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,sing-song tone:
7988,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7989,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Miss Ef May Marsh?”
7990,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7991,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Mrs. White, a heavy-eyed lady in an elaborately embroidered and ruffled"
7992,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"night-dress, gave her hand a little languid shake, and asked, in a"
7993,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"faint, die-away voice:"
7994,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7995,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“How do you rest, my dear?”"
7996,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
7997,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Very well, ma’am, generally, ’cept when I eat too much cake for my"
7998,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,supper.”
7999,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8000,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,At this Mrs. White nodded intelligently.
8001,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8002,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“’S that you, Ef May?” murmured a voice at her elbow, and there was"
8003,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Tommy Bliss, his brown curls all in a tangle, and--oh, horrible! in a"
8004,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,yellow flannel night-gown with _legs_. Such a figure as he was with his
8005,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"short body all the way of a bigness, and his little yellow straddling"
8006,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,legs like an old-fashioned brass andiron.
8007,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8008,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Ef May turned away and pretended not to see him, while she remarked"
8009,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,with an air of kindly condescension to a little girl near her:
8010,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8011,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“It’s _impressively_ warm here.”
8012,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8013,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Kick the clo’es off, then.”"
8014,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8015,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,There was a refreshing briskness in the tones that went straight to Ef
8016,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,May’s heart and she “took to” the stranger on the spot.
8017,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8018,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Who is that old gentleman with such a big tassel in his night-cap?”
8019,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8020,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,The little girl rubbed her eyes and looked in the direction indicated.
8021,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8022,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Oh, that’s old Dr. Opiamus. He gives all the babies paragoric, and the"
8023,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"old folks laudanum, so that they can die and not know it.”"
8024,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8025,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Ef May shuddered. There was something in the idea that even to her
8026,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,childish fancy was horrible.
8027,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8028,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Don’t you want another blanket?” asked her new friend; but Ef May
8029,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,shook her head.
8030,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8031,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“I hear some music?” she exclaimed, and just then began the funniest"
8032,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,medley of sound that was ever heard:
8033,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8034,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"First, a low, soft, half-frightened strain as of some wandering"
8035,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,night-bird calling to his mate to set her glow-worm lamp in the window
8036,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"to light him home; then the quick, cheery note of the cricket chimed"
8037,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,in; the owl’s solemn “too-whit! too-whit! too-whoo!” broke in at
8038,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,stately intervals; and the “rain-call” of the loon burst forth like a
8039,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"wild, weird laugh in the midst of the softer sounds, until the dancers,"
8040,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"who had tried in vain to keep time with the strange music, faltered,"
8041,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"hesitated, and at last stopped entirely, and dropped off to sleep upon"
8042,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the couches and easy chairs with which the rooms were filled, to a low,"
8043,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,monotonous march that sounded exactly like the patter of raindrops upon
8044,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,the roof.
8045,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8046,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"The costumes were a study, and Ef May who strange to say didn’t feel at"
8047,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"all sleepy herself, found it rare fun to watch them."
8048,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8049,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"There were old ladies, who minus their false fronts, teeth, and"
8050,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"spectacles, would never have been recognized by their most intimate"
8051,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"friends, in “calf’s-head” night-caps tied tightly under their chins,"
8052,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"short night-gowns with wide, crimped ruffles at neck and wrists, and"
8053,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,blue flannel petticoats just short enough to show the felt slippers
8054,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"beneath; young ladies, whose wealth of curls, braids and puffs had many"
8055,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"a time excited the admiration and envy of their less fortunate sisters,"
8056,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"appeared here, looking like picked chickens, their luxuriant tresses"
8057,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"packed away in a drawer, their flounces, and ruffles, and panniers, and"
8058,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"overskirts, all safe in the closet, their jewelry and their smiles laid"
8059,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"aside together, and they nodded indifferently to stately gentlemen in"
8060,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"tasselled night-caps and gorgeous dressing gowns, or frowned aside upon"
8061,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"the boys, who, in all sorts of night gear, bobbed about in the most"
8062,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"desirable nooks and corners, disturbing everybody with their clumsy"
8063,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,ways and sleepy drollery.
8064,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8065,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"In short, taken as a whole, a comical looking set they were,--and"
8066,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,_so_ stupid! Ef May felt somewhat hurt and a good deal offended when
8067,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,even her new friend dropped off into a doze instead of listening to
8068,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"her questions, and she was only too glad when a good looking young"
8069,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,gentleman with a pen behind his ear and a roll of manuscript sticking
8070,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"out of the pocket of his dressing gown, walked leisurely up to her and"
8071,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,began talking in a queer rambling fashion about the people around them.
8072,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8073,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“What makes some of the sleepiest folks groan and grumble so, all the"
8074,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"time?” asked the little girl curiously, and her companion laughed, a"
8075,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"queer, dreamy sort of a laugh, as he replied:"
8076,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8077,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“Oh, those are the ones that came here on nightmares,--that sort of"
8078,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"riding always makes people restless, it’s worse than a hobby for that!”"
8079,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8080,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"He spoke the last words with a sudden fierceness that startled her, but"
8081,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"he didn’t seem to notice her frightened face for he kept on talking, in"
8082,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,that steady but far off tone:
8083,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8084,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Do you see that man there with his face all twisted up into a knot?
8085,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"That’s the head master of the Boys’ Grammar School,--he ate toasted"
8086,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"cheese for his supper and he’s having a hard night of it,--no doubt the"
8087,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"_boys_ will have _a hard time of it_, to-morrow.”"
8088,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8089,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Ef May thought of brother Gus’ careless scholarship, and trembled."
8090,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8091,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“There’s a little girl that told a lie to her mother,--hear her moan"
8092,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"and sob! She will confess her fault and ask to be forgiven, in the"
8093,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"morning, I think.”"
8094,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8095,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,Ef May silently took the lesson to heart.
8096,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8097,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,“Do you see that old fellow in the corner? How he grasps with his hands
8098,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"and mutters, and now he is trying to call ‘murder!’ He has spent all"
8099,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"his life hoarding up riches, and now, sleeping or waking, he lives"
8100,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,in constant terror of losing his gold that he will neither spend for
8101,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,himself or others.”
8102,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8103,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“But here,” and the speaker pointed to a corner near at hand, where"
8104,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"rolled up into a round yellow ball, was the figure of Johnny Staples,"
8105,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"sound asleep in the velvety depths of an easy chair, his good-natured,"
8106,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"honest little face, calm and peaceful, with not a cloud of suffering,"
8107,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,remorse or fear to mar its innocent beauty.
8108,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8109,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“But here,” he repeated, “is one who will find in our friend’s party"
8110,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,the refreshment and rest that only health and innocence can reasonably
8111,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,expect.”
8112,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8113,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"Just then the company showed signs of a general breaking up, and the"
8114,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"assembled guests gave such a loud, unanimous _snore_ that Ef May"
8115,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"started up, terrified half out of her senses; and pulling vigorously at"
8116,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"her sleeping sister’s sleeve, she cried out with a burst of angry tears:"
8117,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8118,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"“It’s a nasty, mean old party, any how! They snore, an’ talk in their"
8119,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,"sleep, an’ make up faces, an’--I won’t go again, _so_, there!”"
8120,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,
8121,BY MRS. H. G. ROWE.,But she _did_ for all that.

8132,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.
8133,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8134,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8135,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Of course Queer Church is on Queer Street, in the town of Manoa. And"
8136,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,all good boys and girls who study geography know just where Manoa ought
8137,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,to be.
8138,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8139,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"The Rev. Mr. Thingumbob is the minister, and among the principal"
8140,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"attendants are Mr. So-and-So, Mr. What’s-his-Name, Mr. Jigmaree, Mr."
8141,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"You-Know-Who, Mrs. Grundy, Mr. Tom Collins, the Misses Glubberson, Mr."
8142,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"What-d’ye-Callum, that distinguished foreign family the Van Danks,"
8143,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Mr. William Patterson, Mrs. Partington, and Mr. Gradgrind. You have"
8144,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"possibly heard of some of these persons before. Besides, there is quite"
8145,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"a congregation, and there is also a very big number of little people,"
8146,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,aged all the way from five to fifteen.
8147,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8148,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Where there are so many of them it naturally follows that they have a
8149,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,large number of things their own way. But probably my story would not
8150,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,have been written if a little girl called True Gravelines hadn’t come
8151,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"to town. “True” is short for Gertrude, which was her name."
8152,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8153,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,True had been taken from the Orphan Asylum by Mrs. Potiphar. And
8154,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"because she loved the little lady, Mrs. Potiphar had her taught and"
8155,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"trained as her own daughter, and even Mrs. Grundy said that she"
8156,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"was charming, and the Glubberson girls--who were old maids and not"
8157,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,handsome--allowed that she would make a fine woman.
8158,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8159,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Finally True came across the story of “Goody-Two-Shoes,” which that"
8160,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"great big child of an Oliver Goldsmith told so sweetly, and she had"
8161,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,some new ideas. One of them was that she would like to make some
8162,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,changes in Queer Church.
8163,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8164,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,So she got all the boys and girls together after school and proposed
8165,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"her plan. Now True was tall for her age, with dark eyes, and beautiful"
8166,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"rich brown hair. And she wore lovely dresses, and _such_ kid slippers,"
8167,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,and _such_ a splendid real gold chain with a true and genuine watch
8168,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,that ticked and kept time. So of course she had matters a good deal in
8169,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,her own hands.
8170,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8171,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,The “chatter meeting” (as she called it) was held in the summer-house
8172,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"that cost ten thousand dollars, and that stood among Mrs. Potiphar’s"
8173,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,roses in the side garden back of the lawn. And it resolved to send a
8174,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,committee to wait on Mr. Thingumbob--for Queer Church was the only
8175,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"church in Manoa, and they all went there on Sundays."
8176,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8177,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,They weren’t a bit afraid of him--not they! He had lots of boys and
8178,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"girls of his own, and one of them had such rosy cheeks that he looked"
8179,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,as though the angel had forgotten to bring him to the front door and
8180,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"had stuck him in the apple-tree, whence, when he was ready to be"
8181,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"picked, his father had taken him down."
8182,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8183,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"To be sure True was the head of the delegation, and it started off,"
8184,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"twenty strong, on Saturday morning. How the people at the Manse opened"
8185,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"their eyes as the troop came in, just as grave as you please, and"
8186,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"asking to be shown up to the study. Well, so did the minister when he"
8187,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"saw them. He laid down his pen and he said: “How do you do, gentlemen"
8188,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"and ladies! Pray be seated!” So they all sat down wherever they could,"
8189,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,and waited for True to begin.
8190,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8191,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"“Mr. Thingumbob,” she said, “why can’t we be somebodies in church, too?”"
8192,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8193,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"“I don’t know, my dear. Aren’t you somebodies now?”"
8194,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8195,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"“O-dear-bless-me-no,” says True, all in a breath."
8196,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8197,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"“Well, what would you like to do?” asked Mr. Thingumbob."
8198,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8199,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"“Why, we’d just like to have one week all to ourselves in the church,"
8200,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"and one Sunday all to ourselves, to have sermons, and sing hymns, and"
8201,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,all such things.”
8202,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8203,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,The pastor looked very queer--just like his church. Now _that_ had in
8204,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,it everything to make a church pleasant--but it was all for big people.
8205,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Said he “True, I guess I’ll try it. You stay here with me and let the"
8206,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,rest of these youngsters go.”
8207,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8208,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"So the black-eyed ten-year-older stayed and talked and planned, and"
8209,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"then how they laughed, and then they talked some more and laughed some"
8210,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"more, and then it was dinner-time. And away went True."
8211,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8212,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"On Sunday morning in that beautiful autumn weather, Mr."
8213,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Thingumbob--who did pretty much as _he_ pleased too told the church
8214,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,about it. All that week the children were to have it their own way.
8215,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Nobody was to do anything but the children. As a special favor to
8216,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,himself he wanted to have _them_ do just as they pleased all that week
8217,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"and next Sunday, and he’d be responsible."
8218,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8219,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,When I first heard the story I thought the children and he must have
8220,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"loved each a great deal, for him to make such an offer. And I guess"
8221,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,they did.
8222,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8223,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Let’s see. Monday was his reception evening and he wanted nobody to
8224,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"come but the children. So they all came, and played big people, and"
8225,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"asked about his health and how he enjoyed his summer vacation, and"
8226,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"talked of business, and said their children (doll-children you know)"
8227,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"had the measles and the whooping-cough, and what luck they had in"
8228,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,shooting (with a bow-gun) and how they hoped he’d call soon and all
8229,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"that. Such a time! How funny it did seem, too."
8230,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8231,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"And then there was Tuesday evening, and Mr. Thingumbob had a literary"
8232,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"circle who met in the church parlor. So all the children went, and"
8233,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,all the big people were to have stayed away--but _I_ know some who
8234,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"_peeked_. And Mr. Thingumbob told them about the little boy, Tom"
8235,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Chatterton, up in St. Mary Radcliffe church, and the boxes with the old"
8236,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"papers, and how this small chap wrote poetry and how he pretended to"
8237,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"copy it from the old papers, and how great learned men went to words"
8238,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,over it and some said ‘He did’ and some said ‘He didn’t’ and some
8239,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"called him a ‘forger’ and some called him a ‘genius,’ and how he got"
8240,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"tired of it all, and how he took a drink of arsenic and water and died"
8241,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,when he was hardly grown to be a man.--For that was just what the big
8242,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,folks expected to talk about.
8243,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8244,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"And then there was Wednesday evening, and that was Prayer-meeting."
8245,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And the big grown-up people all stayed away and the little folks all
8246,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,came. How they did sing! And what a pleasant talk they had _that_
8247,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,night too--about the little Boy that heard the doctors and asked them
8248,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,questions until his mother thought he had run away and got lost. And
8249,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Mr. Thingumbob sat right down in the middle of them and they got all
8250,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,around him and he was the only big man there was there.
8251,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8252,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And then there was Thursday night--when the church people used to go
8253,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,to their Mission Chapel and help the poor people to sing and pray
8254,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,and find out how they did and what they wanted. So they all went
8255,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"together--all the larger children of Queer church, that is--and saw the"
8256,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,mission people. And True Gravelines felt so badly for a poor little
8257,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,girl that she gave her her warm gloves. And Tommy What’s-his-name let
8258,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,another fellow have his brand-new jack-knife because he hadn’t got any
8259,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,at all of his own. And there wasn’t one of them that didn’t give the
8260,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Mission people pennies, or promise things to them, like the big folks."
8261,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8262,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And on Friday afternoon they had a sewing-society and the girls came
8263,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"and sewed--dear, dear, what sewing it was!--and they brought lunch"
8264,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"along and the boys came to tea, and it was just like a pic-nic. And Mr."
8265,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Thingumbob was there too. And afterwards they played “Hy-Spy” in the
8266,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"church up-stairs, down the aisles and in the galleries and back of the"
8267,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"organ--and True Gravelines, for real and certain, hid under the pulpit!"
8268,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And then they set back all the chairs in the Sunday-school room and
8269,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,played “Fox and Geese” and “Thread the Needle” and ever so many other
8270,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,things that I don’t know the names of--only I _do_ know that they were
8271,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"bound to act all the while like gentlemen and ladies, and they surely"
8272,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,did.
8273,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8274,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And then came Saturday and they forgot all about being big men and
8275,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"women, and went off to play and let Mr. Thingumbob alone so he could"
8276,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"_write_ his sermon. But he said he didn’t want to write his sermon,"
8277,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"he wanted to _talk_ it, and he asked True what he should talk about."
8278,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And she told him she wanted to hear about the little girl that was
8279,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,sick and died and that Some One took by the hand and made her well.
8280,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"So he said he would, and he promised to use real short weenty-teenty"
8281,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"words--“Because” said True, “there’s some that’s only little bits of"
8282,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,things and _they_ won’t understand.”
8283,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8284,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And then Sunday came. And all the big people took back seats. And all
8285,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"the little people went in to play big people, and opened their bibles"
8286,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"and their hymn-books, and stood up, and sat down, and sang, and leaned"
8287,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"their heads forward in prayer-time, and did just what they saw their"
8288,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"papas and mammas do. And one boy, Peter Gradgrind, he went to sleep,"
8289,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,because he said that was the way his father did. And Mr. Thingumbob
8290,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,laughed when he heard that.
8291,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8292,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"And that was a real short service. It was all there, every bit of it."
8293,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,But the sermon was only a quarter of an hour long and all the rest was
8294,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,in the same proportion.
8295,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8296,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,When it came time for Sunday school they all went. And the biggest one
8297,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,in each class taught the others. And by this time they had all got to
8298,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,be so good that they were trying to be big folks in earnest. And there
8299,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,was Tom Collins Jr. for Superintendent and _he_ tried his best. And
8300,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,True played the tunes on the cabinet organ. And you never did see how
8301,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,well it all went!
8302,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8303,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Weren’t they tired when night came! But out they came again--that is
8304,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,the bigger ones did--and then Mr. Thingumbob talked to them about

8306,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,but I don’t think they will forget it--for it was about a Boy who did
8307,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"what his father and mother wanted him to do, who learned his father’s"
8308,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"business and worked to help the family along, who always did good to"
8309,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"others, who tried to be a boy and yet to do like grown-up folks all the"
8310,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,while. And by this time all the boys and girls knew how it seemed to
8311,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"play at big people, and make calls, and hear sermons, and do good."
8312,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8313,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Then, they all went to bed and slept like tops."
8314,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8315,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And they talk there to this day about it. And isn’t it funny?--the
8316,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,Queer Church people actually have fixed some of the seats in front
8317,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"low enough for the little folks, and they are very proud to see them"
8318,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,sitting there like small men and women. And every now and then Queer
8319,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Church has a sermon in short words, and a prayer-meeting where the"
8320,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"children swarm on Mr. Thingumbob’s chair, and a sewing-club of little"
8321,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"girls--O, and ever so many strange nice things for children, that came"
8322,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,of that week of playing at big people.
8323,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8324,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,And when you ask the folks there “What does Mrs. Grundy say?” and “How
8325,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,does Mr. Gradgrind take it?” what do you think they answer?
8326,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,
8327,BY REV. S. W. DUFFIELD.,"Why, they just say “We don’t care. We want the children to grow up to"

8340,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Cousin Joe had been sitting half asleep over a book in the library,"
8341,BY STANLEY WOOD.,when all at once the door opened just a little and a row of eyes peeped
8342,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"in at him, the eyes beginning somewhere near the top of the door and"
8343,BY STANLEY WOOD.,ending pretty close to the bottom. There were just five of these eyes;
8344,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"the one nearest the top being large and of a lovely soft brown color,"
8345,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"the next one gray, the next one brown, the next blue, and the last one"
8346,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"away down towards the bottom, a mischievous brown."
8347,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8348,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Peep!” said a voice, which matched the mischievous brown eye, and a"
8349,BY STANLEY WOOD.,fat little hand was thrust in through the crack.
8350,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8351,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“May we come in?” asked a soft voice, which sounded near the top of the"
8352,BY STANLEY WOOD.,door.
8353,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8354,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Certainly,” said Joe, shutting his book and trying to look as though"
8355,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"he had not been half asleep over it. The door opened, and the cousins"
8356,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"marched in. First came Bryant, a chubby five-year-old, with sturdy"
8357,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"legs, a large head, yellow hair and brown eyes full of mischief, next"
8358,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"to him Leefee, seven years old, slight of figure, a little lady with"
8359,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"light hair and sky-blue eyes; then Adale, ten years old, her brown hair"
8360,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"flying and her brown eyes dancing; after her Maud, only fourteen, but"
8361,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"quite a young lady for all that, with serious gray eyes, and last of"
8362,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"all, Cora, a slender young woman of seventeen with soft brown hair and"
8363,BY STANLEY WOOD.,eyes.
8364,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8365,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Ladies and gentleman,” said cousin Joe, when they all stood before"
8366,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"him, “to what do I owe the honor of this visit?”"
8367,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8368,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Your Royal Highness,” replied Maud, who had read one of Sir Walter"
8369,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Scott’s novels, “we have a humble petition to present, in which--”"
8370,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8371,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“My top’s broked,” interrupted Bryant, suddenly."
8372,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8373,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“And we want you to tell us a story,” said Adale with eagerness."
8374,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8375,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Have you learned your lessons, Adale?” asked cousin Joe, very solemnly."
8376,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8377,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Oh yes, indeed.”"
8378,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8379,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“Where is Terra del Fuego?”
8380,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8381,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“But cousin, I study geography only five days in the week; you can’t"
8382,BY STANLEY WOOD.,expect me to know where Terra del Fuego is on Saturday.”
8383,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8384,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Really, I hadn’t thought of that.”"
8385,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8386,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“And you’ll tell us a story?” said Leefee.
8387,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8388,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“One we haven’t heard before,” suggested Adale."
8389,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8390,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“My top’s broked,” said Bryant with much emphasis."
8391,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8392,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Friends,” said cousin Joe, “the demand for new stories is in great"
8393,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"excess of the supply. When I finished telling you my last story,"
8394,BY STANLEY WOOD.,Adale there remarked that she had read that story in WIDE AWAKE. Now
8395,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"there’s a moral in that remark of Adale’s, for when my friends and"
8396,BY STANLEY WOOD.,fellow-citizens have grown old enough to read stories they are too old
8397,BY STANLEY WOOD.,for me to tell them to.”
8398,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8399,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Oh, cousin!”"
8400,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8401,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“But, I’ll compromise with you; instead of a story I’ll give you a"
8402,BY STANLEY WOOD.,drawing-lesson.”
8403,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8404,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“I get drawing-lessons enough at school,” said Adale."
8405,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8406,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“I didn’t know you could draw, cousin Joe,” said Clara."
8407,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8408,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“I can’t; and that’s the beauty of my system. The teacher doesn’t need
8409,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"to know anything about drawing, and the students never learn anything.”"
8410,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8411,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“How absurd!” said Cora.
8412,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8413,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“How curious!” said Maud.
8414,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8415,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“How pleasant!” said Adale.
8416,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8417,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“How funny!” said Leefee.
8418,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8419,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“My top’s broked,” said Bryant."
8420,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8421,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“The class will come to order,” said cousin Joe."
8422,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8423,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Then they all gathered around the library-table, and each one was"
8424,BY STANLEY WOOD.,provided with a pencil and a bit of paper.
8425,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8426,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Students of the Fun-and-Frolic Art School,” said Joe, “we have met for"
8427,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"mutual deterioration in art. As you all ought to know, but no doubt"
8428,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"many of you do not, Sir Edward Landseer was a great artist in dogs,"
8429,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Rosa Bonheur is a great artist in horses and kine, but we unitedly"
8430,BY STANLEY WOOD.,will be great artists in--pigs.”
8431,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8432,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“Pigs?”
8433,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8434,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Yes, ladies and gentleman, I repeat it--PIGS! Is there anyone in the"
8435,BY STANLEY WOOD.,class who can draw a pig?”
8436,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8437,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“I can draw one, such as the boys draw on their slates at school,” said"
8438,BY STANLEY WOOD.,Adale.
8439,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8440,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Please draw one then,” said cousin Joe. In a moment Adale had"
8441,BY STANLEY WOOD.,accomplished the task and handed him the result.
8442,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8443,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“This,” said Joe, as he held it up in view of the class, “this is"
8444,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8445,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: THE CONVENTIONAL PIG.]
8446,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8447,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“You see it doesn’t look like a pig, but every boy knows it is intended"
8448,BY STANLEY WOOD.,to represent a pig. If it looked a good deal more like a pig he might
8449,BY STANLEY WOOD.,not recognize it. Thus conventional politeness does not resemble real
8450,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"politeness, yet everybody knows what it is intended to represent. There"
8451,BY STANLEY WOOD.,is a moral in that remark somewhere--if you can find it--and now we’ll
8452,BY STANLEY WOOD.,go on with the lesson. The first thing you must do in order to become
8453,BY STANLEY WOOD.,an artist in my school is to _shut your eyes_.”
8454,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8455,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“Shut our eyes!”
8456,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8457,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Why, cousin,” said Cora, “I thought all artists had to keep their eyes"
8458,BY STANLEY WOOD.,especially wide open.”
8459,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8460,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“There are some who do not,” said cousin Joe, sententiously."
8461,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8462,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“I’ve seen people shut _one_ eye and look at pictures through their
8463,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"hand with the other--so,” said Adale, making a fist of her little hand"
8464,BY STANLEY WOOD.,and peeping through it.
8465,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8466,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Those people were _connoisseurs_,” said Joe; “we are artists and must"
8467,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"shut _both_ eyes, Cora; will you begin? Shut your eyes, place your"
8468,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"pencil on the paper, and draw the outlines of a pig as nearly as you"
8469,BY STANLEY WOOD.,can.”
8470,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8471,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“But, cousin Joe, isn’t this a play for little girls, not"
8472,BY STANLEY WOOD.,for--well--proper young ladies?”
8473,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8474,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Very well, Miss Cora; we’ll begin with Leefee then.”"
8475,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8476,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Little Miss Leefee seized her pencil eagerly, and shutting her eyes"
8477,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"uncommonly close, drew this:"
8478,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8479,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: THIS IS A PIG.]
8480,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8481,BY STANLEY WOOD.,How the rest did laugh at poor Leefee!
8482,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8483,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“You’ll have to write under it, ‘This is a pig,’” said Adale."
8484,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8485,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“And I will do it too,” said Leefee, and she did so, as you can see by"
8486,BY STANLEY WOOD.,the picture.
8487,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8488,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“It’s your turn now, Adale,” said Joe."
8489,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8490,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“This will be a conventional pig, like my other one,” said Adale,"
8491,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"laughing as she shut her eyes. When she had finished her drawing,"
8492,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"all confessed, amidst great laughter, that it was not at all a"
8493,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“conventional pig;” so Adale wrote under her production:
8494,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8495,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: “THIS IS AN UNCONVENTIONAL PIG.”]
8496,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8497,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“It looks more like a tapir than a pig,” said Leefee, mindful of"
8498,BY STANLEY WOOD.,Adale’s criticism on her effort.
8499,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8500,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Well, isn’t a tapir a kind of unconventional pig?” replied the artist."
8501,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8502,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Your pigs are all too long,” said Maud; “you don’t make them fat"
8503,BY STANLEY WOOD.,enough.”
8504,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8505,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“You can be guided by your own criticism, for you come next after"
8506,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Adale,” said cousin Joe, merrily."
8507,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8508,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"Maud drew her pig with great care. “There!” said she, as she displayed"
8509,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"the result of her labors, “what do you think of that?”"
8510,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8511,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: MAUD’S FAT PIG.]
8512,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8513,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“Oh what a funny rabbit!” exclaimed Adale.
8514,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8515,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“It’s more like a rat,” said Leefee."
8516,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8517,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“It _must_ be a pig,” said Maud firmly, “I’m drawing pigs.”"
8518,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8519,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"In the mean time Miss Cora, who had declined to enter into such"
8520,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"childish sport, had been closely observed by Adale. Suddenly that"
8521,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"versatile young lady seized Cora’s paper before she could prevent it,"
8522,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"and exclaiming with a triumphant flourish, “Cora’s pig! Oh, _do_ look"
8523,BY STANLEY WOOD.,at Cora’s pig!” she displayed this:
8524,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8525,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: CORA’S FEROCIOUS PIG.]
8526,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8527,BY STANLEY WOOD.,Cora blushingly acknowledged that she had been induced by the
8528,BY STANLEY WOOD.,enthusiasm of the others to try and improve on their efforts.
8529,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8530,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“What a fierce-looking quadruped,” said Maud."
8531,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8532,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Yes; I have called it my ferocious pig,” replied Cora, evidently"
8533,BY STANLEY WOOD.,greatly enjoying her production.
8534,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8535,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Ladies and gentleman of the Fun-and-frolic Art School,” said"
8536,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"cousin Joe, oratorically, “your incapacity has exceeded my highest"
8537,BY STANLEY WOOD.,expectations. Your efforts to draw the lineaments of the domestic
8538,BY STANLEY WOOD.,animal known as the pig having exceeded in grotesqueness and falseness
8539,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"to nature the efforts of many more experienced artists, I am naturally"
8540,BY STANLEY WOOD.,very much gratified. I now have the honor to announce to you that
8541,BY STANLEY WOOD.,‘school’s out.’”
8542,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8543,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Oh not yet, cousin.”"
8544,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8545,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“Not yet?”
8546,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8547,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“No; _you_ must draw a pig,” said Maud."
8548,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8549,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“You must draw a pig,” said Adale."
8550,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8551,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“You must draw a pig,” said Leefee."
8552,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8553,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“My top’s broked,” said Bryant."
8554,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8555,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Necessity knows no law,” said cousin Joe."
8556,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8557,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Bring me my pencil now, my hand feels skilful, and the shadows lift"
8558,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"from my waked spirit airily and swift,” and with an air of vast"
8559,BY STANLEY WOOD.,importance he began to execute his task. The little cousins were
8560,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"so fearful that he would take a sly peep at his work, that they"
8561,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"blindfolded him, and his production was received with shouts of"
8562,BY STANLEY WOOD.,laughter. When they took off his muffler he saw this:

8564,BY STANLEY WOOD.,[Illustration: THE ACEPHALOUS OR ONE-EYED PIG.]
8565,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8566,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“_Oh_ what a bad pig,” said Cora."

8570,BY STANLEY WOOD.,"“Oh what a _bad_ pig,” said Adale."

8573,BY STANLEY WOOD.,
8574,BY STANLEY WOOD.,“My top--”

8586,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"In 1776, the eastern end of Long Island was over-run with the English"

8588,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,everything was at the mercy of the wicked Hessians.

8602,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,winning words of consolation were often heard in the house of the sick
8603,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"and afflicted. Eight sturdy boys, and one little sweet, timid flower"
8604,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"of a daughter, blessed this good couple, and made their home one of"

8606,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8607,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Edmund, the oldest son, was a handsome, manly lad of eighteen. Beneath"
8608,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"his broad-brimmed hat, his quiet “thee” and “thou,” beat a fiery and"
8609,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,fearless heart that often broke through the mild Quaker training and
8610,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"made him, notwithstanding his peace principles, a leader among his"
8611,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,fellows.
8612,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8613,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"One day, as he sat in the barn, quietly enjoying his noonday rest, a"

8616,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"“Come, youngster, make haste and stir yourself. Go and help my driver"

8637,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,house and told Mrs. Pattison that “a Britisher was going to kill her
8638,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Edmund.” She rushed to the barn, begged the soldier to stop, pleaded"

8644,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,swore he would kill him instantly.

8646,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,“You dare not!” said Edmund firmly; “and I will report you to your

8648,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8649,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"The fierce and defiant look really awed the trooper, and he mounted"

8660,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,The gentle Mrs. Pattison expected to see her boy at once shot down like

8666,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"“You have no right to lay a finger upon that boy, who is a"
8667,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,non-combatant.”

8669,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,The man did not move.
8670,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8671,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Then Farmer Pattison turned toward the road, saying he would ride and"

8673,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8674,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Upon this the horseman, thinking it best for him to see his master"
8675,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"first, drove the spurs into his horse and galloped away, uttering vows"
8676,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,of vengeance.
8677,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8678,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,The little boy who had alarmed Mrs. Pattison was a lad of
8679,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"fourteen,--the son of a neighbor who was in Washington’s army."
8680,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8681,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Sitting one day under the trees, with the little Pattisons, talking"
8682,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"indignantly of the “British thieves,” he saw a light-horseman ride up"
8683,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,toward a farm-house just across the pond. He guessed at once what the
8684,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"man was after. He tried to signal the farmer, but in vain."
8685,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8686,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"“They are pressing horses,” cried Charlie; “they always ride that way"
8687,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,when stealing horses.”

8692,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8693,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Running as fast as he could to the barn, he leaped on to his back, and"

8695,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8696,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"The red-coat saw him, and, putting his spurs into his horse, rising in"

8698,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8699,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,Charlie’s mother rushed to the door. She saw her little son galloping
8700,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,towards the woods with his murderous enemy close upon his heels. Her
8701,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"heart beat fearfully, and she gave one great cry of prayer as her brave"
8702,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"little boy dashed into the thick woods, and out of sight, still hotly"
8703,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,pursued by the soldier.
8704,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8705,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,The trees were close-set and the branches low. Charlie laid down along
8706,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"the horse’s neck to escape being swept off. He cheered on, with low"
8707,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"cries, the wild colt, who stretched himself full length at every leap."
8708,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8709,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"With streaming mane, glaring eyes, distended nostrils, he plunged"
8710,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"onward. Charlie heard the dead dry boughs crackling behind, and the"
8711,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"snorting of the soldier’s horse, so near was his fierce pursuer. On, on"
8712,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Fleetwood dashed, bearing his little master from one piece of woods to"
8713,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"another, till the forest became dense and dark. He had now gained some"
8714,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"on the soldier; and, seeing ahead a tangled, marshy thicket, Charlie"
8715,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,rode right into its midst.
8716,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8717,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,Here he stood five hours without moving.
8718,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8719,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"The soldier, so much heavier with his horse, dared not venture into the"
8720,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"swamp. He rode round and round, seeking for some firm spot of entrance."
8721,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Sometimes he did come very near; but every time sinking into the wet,"
8722,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,springy bog he was obliged to give it up; he could not even get a shot
8723,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"at the boy, the brush was so thick, Fleetwood instinctively still as a"
8724,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"mouse, and finally, with loud oaths, he rode off."
8725,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8726,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"But the lad and the colt still stood there hour after hour, not knowing"
8727,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"whether they might venture out; but at nightfall his mother, who had"
8728,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"been watching all the while, with tears and prayers, saw her dear boy"
8729,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,cautiously peeping through the edge of the woods. By signs she let
8730,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"him know that the danger was past, and, riding up to the house, he"
8731,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"dismounted. Then, leaning against his beautiful colt, his own bright,"
8732,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"golden curls mingling with Fleetwood’s ebon mane, the plucky little"
8733,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,fellow told his adventures to the eager group.
8734,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8735,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"The Quaker neighbors in this vicinity had at last been driven, by the"
8736,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"outrages of the hostile troops, to use some means of defense. They"
8737,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"agreed that, whenever a house should be attacked, the family would fire"
8738,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"a gun, which would be answered by firing from other houses, and so the"
8739,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,neighborhood become aroused.
8740,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8741,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,But Farmer Pattison so abhorred the use of a gun that he would have
8742,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"none in his house. He procured a conch-shell which, when well blown,"
8743,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,could be heard a great way.
8744,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8745,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"One night, while Charlie’s family were all soundly sleeping, and,"
8746,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"without, the clear November air was unstirred by a breath of wind,"
8747,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,suddenly the grum report of the conch boomed in at the windows and
8748,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,alarmed the whole house.

8750,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,[Illustration]
8751,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8752,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Wakened so unceremoniously, all thought it was a gun; but no one could"
8753,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,tell whence it came. The venerable grandfather knelt in prayer; the
8754,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"sick English officer, staring at the house, ordered his two guards to"
8755,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"prepare for defence; the mother sat trembling, while the two little"
8756,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"girls, Grace and Marcia, hid their faces in their mother’s night-dress."
8757,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8758,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"But our Charlie was brave. He loaded the old firearm, and, going"
8759,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"down to the piazza blazed away, loading and firing, to frighten away"
8760,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,the unseen foe. Through the still air could be heard the guns of the
8761,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"neighbors, all aroused to defend their homes."
8762,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8763,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"But no burning building could be seen, nor were there any shouts or"

8765,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8766,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"The alarm subsided, but for the rest of the night the little family sat"
8767,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,anxious and waited for the dawn. In the morning they learned the cause
8768,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"of the alarm. It seems that at noon, the day before, the Pattison boys"
8769,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"were trying their lungs on the conch, calling the hired men to dinner."
8770,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8771,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Little Joseph stood by, waiting his turn, but it didn’t come. Dinner"
8772,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"was ready, and the shell was put away on the shelf over the kitchen"
8773,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"door. The little fellow’s disappointment was great, and that night he"
8774,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"dreamed of robbers, of English soldiers and burning houses. He dreamed"
8775,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,that he must blow the shell.
8776,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,
8777,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"Up he jumped, ran down stairs, and through two rooms, still asleep,"
8778,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"and, standing in a chair, got the conch from the shelf. Going to the"
8779,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"back door he blew it lustily, and aroused the whole family. They rushed"
8780,BY C. H. WOODMAN.,"down-stairs in great alarm, and there stood the little boy, bareheaded"

8792,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Not long ago, while I was waiting for the cars at a street corner, I"
8793,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,heard two men talking together. The one was a young fellow of nineteen
8794,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"or so, a big, tall youth, whose appearance would have been pleasing had"
8795,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"he not worn, in addition to a general air of discouragement, that look"
8796,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"of being on the down-hill road, which, once seen, is unmistakable."
8797,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8798,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"His clothes were sufficiently good in quality, but they seemed never"
8799,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to have known the clothes-brush, his coat lacked four or five buttons,"
8800,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"for which three pins were a very inadequate substitute, and he had an"
8801,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,aspect generally of having forgotten the use of soap and water.
8802,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8803,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Perhaps all this might not have been his fault. It is possible he had
8804,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"no womankind belonging to him, though I don’t hold that an excuse for"
8805,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"missing buttons, and his work might have been such as bred fluffiness"
8806,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and griminess, but no man’s work obliges him to slouch when off duty,"

8808,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8809,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The other man was a brisk, middle-aged person, whom I take to have been"
8810,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"a worker in iron in one way or another. He had on his working-dress,"
8811,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and his hands were black, but the blackness in his case was a mere"
8812,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"outside necessity, and went no farther than the surface. He looked"
8813,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"bright and sensible, and it was in a pleasant voice that he asked the"
8814,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,younger man:
8815,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8816,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Well, Jim, got a place?”"
8817,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8818,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Jim gave a weary, discouraged sigh, and shifted from one foot to the"

8823,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Why?”
8824,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8825,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Oh,” returned Jim, in a forlorn manner, “what’s the use? I work all"
8826,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the week, and when Saturday night comes, there’s just five dollars."
8827,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"What’s that? Why, it’s _just nothing_.”"
8828,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8829,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“No, it ain’t,” replied the senior, laying a kindly hand on the other’s"
8830,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,shoulder. “It’s _just five dollars better than nothing_. Put it that
8831,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"way, Jim.”"
8832,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
8833,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Well, now, that’s so,” said Jim, brightening up wonderfully after a"
8834,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"minute’s thought. “It does make it seem different, don’t it?” And he"

8851,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“‘_Jack and Jill went up the hill_,’” piped Bud’s shrill voice from the"
8852,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,hayloft in the barn where she was hunting eggs. “‘_To fetch a pail of
8853,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"water. Jack fell down and broke his crown, And Jill_----’”"
8854,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8855,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,If Bud’s own name had been Jill she could not have come “tumbling
8856,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"after,” any more speedily than she did. A board tilted, her foot"
8857,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"slipped, and in a moment she was sitting on the floor below."
8858,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Fortunately a quantity of hay had fallen with her, so there was no"
8859,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,broken crown or other crushed bones; but her dignity was considerably
8860,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"jarred, and glancing around to see whether any one had witnessed the"
8861,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"mishap, she discovered Kip looking out toward the road from a door at"
8862,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the farther end of the building.
8863,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8864,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Kip Crail! what makes you stand there for?” she demanded, severely."
8865,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8866,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I’m a-watching my minister,” answered Kip slowly."
8867,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8868,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"It is not every boy who owns a minister all by himself, but Kip spoke"
8869,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,as if nobody else had any claim upon this one; and as he seemed to
8870,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"have noticed neither her tone nor her downfall, Bud regained her"
8871,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"chubby feet, shook the hay from her yellow curls, and going to Kip’s"
8872,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"side looked curiously after the slightly grey-haired man, in clothing"
8873,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"somewhat worn, who was quietly picking his way along the road."
8874,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Her blue eyes discerned nothing remarkable, and she turned away"
8875,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,disappointed.
8876,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8877,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“Ho! Why he’s everybody’s minister; he a’n’t yours.”
8878,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8879,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Kip knew better than that. Did not he remember who always knew him,"
8880,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"and stopped to shake hands and say “How do you do, Christopher?”--a"
8881,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,name that made him feel nearly as big as anybody. And who always asked
8882,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,after his mother? And did not forget when he told him little Bob was
8883,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,sick? The people in the house hitched up their sleek horses and nice
8884,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"carriage, and drove two miles to the city church every Sunday; but Kip,"
8885,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"with freckled face shining from soap, head wet and combed till not a"
8886,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"hair could stir from its place, and red hands thrust into his pockets,"
8887,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,trudged whistling over the hill to the little frame church where most
8888,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,of the people from the straggling villages and the neighboring farms
8889,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,gathered.
8890,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8891,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“So he is my minister,” said Kip stoutly as he considered the matter."
8892,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8893,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"He would have liked to share the honor that day, however, with the"
8894,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,inmates of the large comfortable farm-house; for they were really
8895,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the most prosperous family in the village, while he, only a distant"
8896,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"relative, was “chore boy and gener’ly useful” as he phrased it. And"
8897,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,there was to be a “donation party” at his minister’s home that very
8898,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,evening.
8899,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8900,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“If they’d just give something handsome!” he said to Nancy the “hired
8901,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"girl,” who was busy in the kitchen."
8902,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8903,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“They won’t never think of it no more’n they will of flyin’,” replied"
8904,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Nancy, dextrously turning a flapjack, and the subject also, by"
8905,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,requesting Kip to “run for an armful of wood.”
8906,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8907,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Somebody always wanted wood or water, or something from the cellar, or"
8908,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"something from the attic, whenever Kip was in sight. But he scarcely"
8909,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"thought of the constant calls that morning, so full was he of other"
8910,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"thoughts. Nancy might dispose of the question carelessly, but he could"
8911,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"not. He was connected with the house, and he felt that the honor of the"
8912,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"house was involved. Beside, he wanted his minister well treated and he"
8913,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,knew--few knew better than Kip--how sorely the “something handsome”
8914,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,was needed in the shabby little parsonage. He did not mean they should
8915,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“never think of it” as Nancy had said! he would remind them by bringing
8916,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,up the subject naturally and innocently in some way.
8917,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8918,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"So he lingered in the room a few minutes after breakfast, while Mrs."
8919,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Mitchel was gathering up the dishes, and Mr. Mitchel consulting the"
8920,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"almanac. He coughed once or twice, and then, staring straight out of"
8921,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the window, observed as follows:"
8922,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8923,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“There goes our big rooster! He’s most as big as a turkey, a’n’t he,"
8924,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Aunt Ann? Turkeys always make me think of Thanksgivings, Christmases,"
8925,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Donations and such things--oh yes! there _is_ going to be a donation
8926,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,down to the minister’s to-night!”
8927,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8928,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Kip considered that very delicately and neatly done!
8929,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8930,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Eh? what?” said Mrs. Mitchel, paying no attention except to the last"
8931,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,sentence.
8932,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8933,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“Who’s going to have a donation?”
8934,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8935,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Down to the minister’s,” repeated Kip. “Everybody’ll take ’em things,"
8936,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"you know--flour and potatoes and wood--something handsome, I hope--the"
8937,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,folks that can ’ford to.”
8938,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8939,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,That was another masterly hint. Kip chuckled to himself at his success
8940,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,in managing his self-appointed task but his spirits sank with Mr.
8941,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Mitchel’s first words.
8942,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8943,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Well, now, I don’t know as I approve of that way. The folks here can"
8944,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,do as they please--it’s no affair of mine--but seems to me it’s better
8945,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"to pay a man a decent salary, and let him buy his own things.”"
8946,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8947,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Don’t know as _I_ ’prove of that way either,” soliloquized Kip"
8948,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,indignantly when he found himself alone behind the wood-pile. “Don’t
8949,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"know as I ’prove of folks giving me their old clothes,” looking down"
8950,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,at his patched knees. “Seems to me ’twould be better to pay me decent
8951,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"wages and let me buy my own clothes. But seein’ they don’t, these"
8952,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,trousers are better’n none; and I guess if Uncle Ralph had a sick wife
8953,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,and three or four children he’d think a donation party was a good deal
8954,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,better’n nothing.”
8955,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8956,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Ideas that found their way into the brain under Kip’s thatch of light
8957,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"hair were sure to stay, and the cows, the chickens, and the wood-pile"
8958,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,heard numerous orations that morning--all upon one subject.
8959,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8960,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Now if I owned all these things, do you s’pose I’d go off to the big"
8961,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"city church every Sunday, and wouldn’t go down now and then to see what"
8962,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"was a-doin’ for the poor folks round here? And when I went, don’t you"
8963,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"s’pose I’d see how his coat was gettin’ shinier and shinier, and her"
8964,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"cloak fadeder, and all the new clothes they have is their old ones made"
8965,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"over? A boy don’t like that kind of dressin’-up partic’lar well, and"
8966,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,how do you s’pose my minister feels? Don’t you b’lieve I’d know when
8967,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"she got sick, how the bundles from the grocery-store was smaller and"
8968,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,fewer ’count of the bottles that had to be paid for and the doctor’s
8969,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,bill? And wouldn’t I hear the tremble in his voice when he prays for
8970,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,them that has ‘heavy burdens to carry?’ Just wait till I’m a man and
8971,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,see!”
8972,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8973,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Old Brindle looked at him meditatively, and one pert little bantam"
8974,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"mounted the fence and crowed with enthusiasm, but no member of"
8975,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the barn-yard offered any suggestions; and going to a little nook
8976,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"behind the manger, Kip drew forth his own offering for the important"
8977,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"evening--a little bracket-shelf, clumsily designed and roughly whittled"
8978,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"out, but nevertheless the work of many a precious half-hour. He looked"
8979,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,at it rather doubtfully. It did not altogether satisfy even his limited
8980,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,conceptions of beauty.
8981,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8982,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“But then if you keep it kind of in the shade, and look at it sort"
8983,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"o’sideways--so--it does pretty well,” he said, scrutinizing it with one"
8984,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"eye closed. “I guess Mis’ Clay will, seein’ she’s had to look sharp for"
8985,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the best side o’things so long.”
8986,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8987,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,But how he did wish the others would send something--“something that
8988,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"would count,” as he said. He was down on the ground gathering up a"
8989,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,basketful of chips when one of the well-kept horses and the light
8990,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,wagon passed out of the yard and down the lane bearing Mr. Mitchel away
8991,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,to the town. A host of brilliant possibilities suddenly trooped through
8992,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Kip’s thoughts as he watched the vehicle out of sight. His wish grew
8993,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,into something deeper and stronger.
8994,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8995,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“Oh please _do_ make him think and bring back something nice for them!”
8996,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,he murmured.
8997,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
8998,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Bud, who had a fashion of appearing in the most unexpected times and"
8999,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"places, looked at him wonderingly from around a corner of the wood-pile."
9000,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9001,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“What makes you do that for?” she asked solemnly.
9002,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9003,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“’Cause,” answered Kip briefly, with a flush rising to his freckled"
9004,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"cheeks. “I don’t care,” he whispered to himself. “The minister’s folks"
9005,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"are good and care for other folks, and it’s ’bout time somebody was"
9006,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,takin’ care of them.”
9007,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9008,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Bud did not quite accept the lucid explanation given her. She seated
9009,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,herself on a log and pondered the subject until she reached a
9010,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"conclusion that she considered satisfactory; and after that, though"
9011,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"she said nothing about it, she watched quite as eagerly and much more"
9012,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,expectantly for her father’s return than did Kip.
9013,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9014,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,There certainly was something new and unusual in the light wagon when
9015,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,at last it drove up to the door again. Both children discovered that
9016,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"at once--Bud from the window, Kip from the piazza--a great, easy,"
9017,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,luxurious arm-chair. Mr. Mitchel lifted it out and carried it into the
9018,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,house.
9019,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9020,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“See here! What do you think of that?” he said to his wife
9021,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,triumphantly. “I happened into a furniture store where they were
9022,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,auctioning everything off and I got this at such a bargain that I took
9023,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,it in a hurry. Isn’t that as comfortable a chair as you ever saw? Just
9024,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,try it.”
9025,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9026,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Mrs. Mitchel examined and admired; Nancy who came to the kitchen door
9027,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,exclaimed and interjected; and the household generally bestowed such
9028,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,unqualified commendation that Mr. Mitchel’s gratification increased.
9029,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9030,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I think I know a good thing when I see it,” he declared, “and this"
9031,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,couldn’t be bought anywhere else for that money. Nothing in the world
9032,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the matter with it either, not a flaw about it except”--showing where"
9033,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the back could be lowered to make it more of a reclining chair--“this
9034,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,spring works a little hard. But a cabinet-maker could fix that in a few
9035,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"moments, and we’ll have it done right away. Kip!” as the boy passed the"
9036,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"door--“Kip, could you take this down to the parson’s this afternoon? I"
9037,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,want it to go at once.”
9038,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9039,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Kip could scarcely believe his ears. “Yes _sir_!” he said with his eyes
9040,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"fairly dancing. “You mean to send it to him, uncle Ralph? guess I can"
9041,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,take it!”
9042,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9043,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,He never called his minister “the parson”--it scarcely sounded
9044,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,respectful enough--but of course he knew who was meant and he was
9045,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,far too happy for any criticising thought. That handsome easy chair!
9046,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Wouldn’t the very sight of it rest poor tired Mrs. Clay? Kip could see
9047,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,just how her pale face would look leaned back against the cushions.
9048,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9049,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,[Illustration: “AND JILL CAME TUMBLING AFTER.”]
9050,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9051,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“It’s pretty heavy for you to carry so far though,” Mr. Mitchel was"
9052,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,saying when Kip recalled his wandering wits far enough to understand.
9053,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“’Jim could take it in the wagon perhaps”--
9054,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9055,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I might put it in the hand-cart and wheel it over,” interposed Kip"
9056,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"with a sudden inspiration. He could bear no delay, and he wanted to"
9057,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,take it himself.
9058,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9059,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Mr. Mitchel commended that suggestion as “not a bad notion on Kip’s
9060,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,part.”
9061,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9062,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“And what shall I tell him, uncle Ralph?”"
9063,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9064,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Tell him--why, he’ll understand; he can see for himself. Tell him I"
9065,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"sent it, and he’ll know what to do with it, I suppose.”"
9066,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9067,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Kip supposed so too. He waited for no further directions, but made"
9068,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"a partial toilet very expeditiously, and was soon safely out on the"
9069,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,road with his treasure. To say that he was pleased and proud is a
9070,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,very faint description of his feelings. He trundled that hand-cart by
9071,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"no out-of-the-way route, and he was not long alone; the village boys"
9072,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,hailed him:
9073,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9074,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Hello, Kip! What you got there?”"
9075,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9076,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“It’s our folks’ present to the minister,” answered Kip grandly, and"
9077,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,one after another the admiring boys fell into line until the chair
9078,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,formed the center of a triumphal procession. The village soon knew of
9079,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the gift, as the village always did know of everything that happened"
9080,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"within its limits, and Kip had the satisfaction of being stopped"
9081,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"several times, and of hearing that Mr. Mitchel had done “the handsome"
9082,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"thing,” and that the chair was “out-and-out nice.”"
9083,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9084,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"So, in a beatific state, he reached the gate of the little parsonage."
9085,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,There was no lack of assistance. Every urchin was anxious to share at
9086,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"least the reflected glory of helping to carry it, and it was borne to"
9087,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the house very much as a party of ants bear off a lump of sugar--by
9088,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"swarming all over it. The minister came to the door, the body-guard"
9089,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"fell back, and Kip presented his prize."
9090,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9091,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Here’s something that Uncle Ralph sent you, sir; he bought it in town"
9092,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"to-day. He said tell you he sent it, and he guessed you’d know what to"
9093,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"do with it,” he said with shining eyes."
9094,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9095,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"The minister’s eyes shone too, and then grew dim. This was so"
9096,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"unexpected, and it meant so much to him! It had sometimes seemed hard"
9097,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"to that kindly, tender heart that the one of all the village who could"
9098,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"have done most, had never manifested any interest in his work for those"
9099,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,poor people--had not lifted with even a finger the burden of care and
9100,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"sacrifice, or shown any disposition to aid or encourage. But there"
9101,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,must have been sympathy after all. This was a generous gift in its
9102,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"luxuriousness--a thoughtful one, for it was for the dear invalid. He"
9103,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,opened a door near him and said softly:
9104,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9105,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Rachel, look here!”"
9106,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9107,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"How he had wanted just such an easy, restful cushioned niche for the"
9108,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,worn slight form! The boys could not understand what it was to him in
9109,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,itself and in what it represented--“Only his voice had a tremble in it
9110,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"like when he prays,” Kip said to himself on his homeward way."
9111,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9112,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,However he hated “fixed up company” in general he would not for
9113,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"anything miss the gathering at the parsonage that evening, and wood and"
9114,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"water, cows and kindlings must be looked after early. So it happened"
9115,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,he did not speak with Mr. Mitchel again until nightfall. Then that
9116,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,gentleman bethought him of his commission.
9117,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9118,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Ah, Kip, carried the chair safely, did you?”"
9119,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9120,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“Yes sir.”
9121,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9122,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Well, what did he say to it?”"
9123,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9124,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I wish you’d seen him, uncle Ralph!” said Kip radiantly. “Not, as he"
9125,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"said much either, only something ’bout he didn’t know how to thank"
9126,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,you--”
9127,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9128,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“How to thank me?” repeated Mr. Mitchel in amazement. “Why should he?
9129,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"He isn’t so short of work as all that, is he?”"
9130,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9131,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Short of work, uncle Ralph!” It was Kip’s turn to open wide eyes"
9132,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"of astonishment. “I should think not, with all his preachin’ and"
9133,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Sunday-school and poor folks! I don’t s’pose he thought he’d have time
9134,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"to sit in it much himself; but Mrs. Clay, she’s sick--”"
9135,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9136,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“What have the Clays to do with it?” demanded Mr. Mitchel with clouding
9137,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,brow and a dawning suspicion of something wrong. “I told you to take it
9138,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,to Mr. Parsons--the cabinet-maker’s--to have that spring fixed.”
9139,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9140,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Kip saw it all then, but he wished the floor would quietly open and"
9141,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"drop him into the cellar, or that he could fly through the roof. He"
9142,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and his face flushed and paled."
9143,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9144,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I--thought--you said the parson’s,” he stammered. “I s’posed ’twas for"
9145,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the minister’s donation, and so--”"
9146,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9147,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“You took it there?” Mr. Mitchel completed the sentence. “Now how in
9148,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,the world--”
9149,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9150,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"But it was too much to be borne. Kip waited for nothing more, but"
9151,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"rushed from the house, and if in the shadow of the friendly wood-pile"
9152,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"he leaned his head against the rough sticks and cried, there was no one"
9153,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,to see.
9154,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9155,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“They may fix it up any way they please,” he said. “I can’t do it! I"
9156,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,can’t and I wont!”
9157,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9158,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,A little later he stood by the old gate watching the great yellow moon
9159,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"come up, and digging his red fists into his eyes now and then to wipe"
9160,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"away some stray tears of shame, indignation and grief that still"
9161,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"gathered there. This was not a very nice world anyhow, he decided with"
9162,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,a queer aching spot at his heart. Almost it seemed as if he had asked
9163,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,for bread and received a stone--a sharp heavy stone at that.
9164,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9165,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Indoors Mr. Mitchel had expressed very distinctly his opinion of the
9166,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"carelessness and obtuseness that could have caused such a blunder, and"
9167,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"the “awkwardness of the whole thing,” and in no little vexation was"
9168,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,trying to find some means of remedy.
9169,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9170,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“I might write a note and explain, but then--I declare it’s the most"
9171,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,awkward disagreeable thing I ever knew! Such a stupid blunder.”
9172,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9173,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Papa,” interposed the slow, wondering voice of Bud, “I didn’t know"
9174,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,there could be any mistakes up there.”
9175,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9176,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Up where, child?”"
9177,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9178,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“In heaven. Kip prayed you’d bring something for his minister--’cause
9179,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"I heard him--behind the wood-pile,” said Bud with slow emphasis. “I"
9180,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"thought that made the chair come. I’m most sure ’twasn’t any mistake,"
9181,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,papa.”
9182,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9183,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Mr. Mitchel pushed aside pen and paper, put on his hat and walked out."
9184,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,He really did not know the best way out of the difficulty. It was very
9185,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"vexatious, and in his perplexity he journeyed towards the parsonage."
9186,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,When he came in sight of the house he paused. What did he intend to do?
9187,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Go there when others were making their offerings, and explain that he"
9188,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"had not wished to show any friendship or appreciation, and wanted to"
9189,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,take back what had been proffered through mistake? Certainly not! He
9190,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"turned, but at that moment some one joined him."
9191,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9192,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Ah, Mr. Mitchel! Just going in? That was a generous gift of"
9193,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,yours--exactly the thing for poor Mrs. Clay.”
9194,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9195,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Others came with similar comment. There was no chance to say anything,"
9196,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"and scarcely knowing why or how, Mr. Mitchel found himself in the"
9197,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"well-filled room, saw the sweet, pale face, with its smile of welcome"
9198,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"for all, looking out from the cushions of the new chair, and felt the"
9199,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,quick warm grateful clasp of the minister’s hand. Something in look and
9200,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"clasp and murmured words brought a sudden throb to Mr. Mitchel’s heart,"
9201,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,a moisture to his eye.
9202,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9203,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"Then, before he had time to recover from his bewilderment, some one"
9204,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"had called on him to “make a few remarks,” and others echoed the"
9205,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"request, and he found himself pushed forward to the front and heard"
9206,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"his own voice saying, “How much cause all had to value Mr. Clay’s work"
9207,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"in the village,” and expressing the hope that he might “enjoy these"
9208,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"simple offerings as tokens of esteem and friendship.” Aye, and he"
9209,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"meant it too, for catching the spirit of those around him, and swiftly"
9210,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,comprehending more of the good man’s life and work than he had ever
9211,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"done before, he only regretted that he had not sent the offering of his"
9212,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,own free will and pleasure.
9213,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9214,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"He found an opportunity, however, to whisper to Kip who had slipped in"
9215,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,later with very sober face--a face that brightened at sight of him.
9216,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9217,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,“It’s all right. Don’t say a word to anybody about it.”
9218,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9219,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"He had a pleasant evening despite a feeling of strangeness about it,"
9220,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,and on his homeward way muttered something to himself about “a blessed
9221,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"blunder.” What he told at home Kip did not know, but when the boy"
9222,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"arrived, a little later, Bud, wide-awake and listening for his step,"
9223,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,raised her yellow head from its pillow and called:
9224,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9225,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,"“Ke--ip! it all comed out right, didn’t it?”"
9226,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,
9227,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,Kip thought it had. He was sure of it afterward when he saw the
9228,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,friendship that from that night began between the Mitchels and “his
9229,BY KATE W. HAMILTON.,minister.”

9245,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9246,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,“Then you don’t believe _me_?” asked Mrs. Turner rather severely. “I
9247,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"wish I had never seen that boy! I’m sure I have done my best by him,"
9248,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"and been a mother to him. And now he’s turned out bad, everybody blames"
9249,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"me for it. Father says, if he has done it, it is my fault for tempting"
9250,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,him; Nelly has nearly cried her eyes out about it; and everybody seems
9251,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,to think it is more wicked to lose a spoon than to steal it--I declare

9253,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9254,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Well, he’s been a good, honest boy ever since he came here--a real"

9257,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,shaking her head.
9258,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9259,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I don’t know about jerks,” answered Mrs. Turner, “but I do know that,"
9260,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"as soon as I had done cleaning that spoon, I put it back in the case,"
9261,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"and as I was a-going to put it away, Jim comes in to get a pail, and"
9262,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"says he, ‘ain’t it a pretty little box!’ and says I: ‘yes, but what’s"
9263,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"in it is prettier.’ Then I smelt my bread a-burning, and I put down the"
9264,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"case right here,” said Mrs. Turner striking the corner of her kitchen"
9265,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"table, “and I ran to see to my bread, and when I came back Jim was"
9266,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"gone, and my spoon was gone too. And I don’t suppose it walked off"

9268,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9269,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Of course it didn’t,” said Mrs. Martin; “but some one else might have"

9271,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9272,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I’d like to know where that somewhere is, then,” said Mrs. Turner; “I"
9273,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"have looked high and low and turned the house upside-down for a week,"
9274,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,and I haven’t seen any spoon yet. And nobody could come in without my
9275,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,seeing them because the front door was locked and so was the kitchen
9276,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"door, and anybody who came in or went out had to go through the back"
9277,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"kitchen where I was. I saw Jim go out with his pail, but I didn’t"
9278,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,suspect anything then--why should I? And it isn’t the spoon I mind so
9279,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"much, it’s the trouble, and the idea of that boy that had been treated"
9280,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,like one of the family--but I won’t say anymore about it. I’ll send him
9281,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"back to New York, and”--"
9282,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9283,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No, don’t do that! I guess I’ll take him,” said Mrs. Martin. “He"
9284,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"hasn’t any home to go to, and if you send him back, there’s no telling"
9285,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,what will become of him. Where is he?”
9286,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9287,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I guess he is sulking about the place somewhere,” said Mrs. Turner."
9288,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“He said he hadn’t done it, and now he won’t say another word. I’ll"
9289,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,call him if you really want him.”
9290,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9291,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin said she really wanted him, and Mrs. Turner, stepping out"
9292,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"on the kitchen porch, called out, “Jim, Jim!”"
9293,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9294,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"There was no answer, but pretty soon a boy walked across the yard"
9295,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"toward the house, and stopped near the porch."
9296,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9297,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"He was a boy about twelve years old, tall of his age and rather thin,"
9298,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"and with a round, honest face, which looked very pleasant when he was"
9299,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"happy, but which was at that moment very much clouded."
9300,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9301,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I’ll speak to him by myself, if you don’t mind,” said Mrs. Martin,"
9302,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,shutting the door and seating herself on the porch step.
9303,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9304,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Come here, my boy,” said she kindly, while her homely face looked"
9305,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,almost beautiful with goodness. “I don’t believe you are a bad boy; I
9306,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"think it’s all a mistake, and it will come out all right some day. I am"
9307,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"going to take you home with me, if you will come.”"
9308,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9309,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim’s brown eyes brightened, but he answered, not very gratefully,"
9310,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Thank you, but I’d better go away from here--they all believe I took"
9311,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,it.”
9312,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9313,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No, they don’t; I don’t for one. You had better stay and behave like a"
9314,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"good, honest lad, and I’ll be a true friend to you. Besides, we mustn’t"
9315,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,run away from our troubles! you know they are sent to make us good and
9316,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"strong, don’t you see, my boy?”"
9317,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9318,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Having finished her little sermon, Mrs. Martin got up and gave Jim a"
9319,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,motherly hug and a kiss. And poor Jim “broke down” as he would have
9320,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"called it. But it was a breaking down that did him a world of good, and"
9321,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,made a new boy of him.
9322,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9323,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“There, there,” said Mrs. Martin, “now go and get your things, and we"
9324,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,will go home.”
9325,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9326,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Jim went up-stairs quietly to the little attic room that had been
9327,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,his own for two years. He made a small bundle of his old clothes. He
9328,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,wouldn’t take the new ones. “They was my friends when they got them for
9329,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"me,” he said to himself, “but now they ain’t my friends any more, and"
9330,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,them clothes don’t belong to me now.”
9331,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9332,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim’s grammar was not perfect, but he meant well, and in his heart he"
9333,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,was very sorry to leave the friends who had been so kind to him during
9334,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,two happy years.
9335,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9336,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"As he turned to go down-stairs, he heard a noise in the hall, not far"
9337,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"from him, and he saw Nellie Turner who seemed to be waiting for him."
9338,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Oh! Jim,” she said, and could not say more, because she began to cry."
9339,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9340,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Poor little Nelly had been breaking her heart about Jim’s trouble. She
9341,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"was a nice little girl ten years old, with bright yellow curls, pink"
9342,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"cheeks, and blue eyes; but now the pink of her cheeks had run into her"
9343,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"eyes, and she did not look as pretty as usual. But Jim thought she was"
9344,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"beautiful, and her red eyes were a great comfort to him."
9345,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9346,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"At last he spoke, “Good-by, Nelly; I am going away.”"
9347,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9348,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I know it,” said Nelly, “but, Jim, I don’t believe you are bad, and"
9349,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"you will be good, won’t you?”"
9350,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9351,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Yes, I will,” said Jim. Then he left Nelly crying on the stairs, and"
9352,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,went quickly to the porch where Mrs. Martin was waiting for him.
9353,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9354,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Well, good-by, Jim,” said Mrs. Turner. “I hope you’ll be a good boy."
9355,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Remember I have been kind to you.”
9356,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9357,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Yes’m, thank you,” said Jim, rather coldly. He wanted to see “Father,”"
9358,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,but Mr. Turner had taken himself out of the way.
9359,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9360,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"While Mrs. Martin was walking home with her little friend, and talking"
9361,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"to him to cheer him up, they heard something running after them, and"
9362,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim said, “Here is Spot, what shall I do? I am afraid I can’t make him"
9363,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,go back.”
9364,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9365,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Well, we’ll take him home, too,” said Mrs. Martin. “I like dogs,"
9366,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,they are such faithful friends; they don’t care if people are pretty
9367,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"or ugly, rich or poor, good or bad, they just love them, and stick to"
9368,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"them. Yes, we will take Spot, and make him happy.”"
9369,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9370,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"This remark made two people very happy. Jim brightened up, and laughed;"
9371,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"and Spot, who had kept his tail between his legs in a most respectful"
9372,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"and entreating manner, now began to wag it joyfully, and showed his"
9373,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"love by nearly knocking down Mrs. Martin, to let her know that he"
9374,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"understood what she had said, and approved of it."
9375,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9376,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Spot had been given to Jim by one of his school-mates, and Jim was very"
9377,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,proud of his only piece of personal property. Spot was a white dog with
9378,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"a great many black spots all over him, and he was not exactly a beauty,"
9379,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"but he was the best, lovingest, naughtiest, and most ridiculous young"
9380,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"dog that ever adorned this world. He was always stealing bones, and"
9381,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"old boots and shoes, and burying them in secret places as if they had"
9382,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"been treasures, and no one had the heart to scold him much, because he"
9383,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"looked so repentant and as if he would never, no never, do it again as"
9384,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,long as he lived.
9385,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9386,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Since the silver spoon had disappeared, Spot had been very unhappy;"
9387,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,people seemed to give him all the benefit of their disturbed tempers.
9388,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Turner spoke crossly to him, and would not let him stay in the"
9389,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,kitchen; Mr. Turner had slyly kicked him several times; Nelly cried
9390,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"over him when he wanted to play, and Jim only patted his head, and"
9391,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"said, “poor Spot, poor Spot!” by which he meant, “poor Jim, poor"
9392,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim!” But now Spot felt that a good time was coming, and he rejoiced"
9393,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"beforehand, like a sensible dog."
9394,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9395,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"And, in truth, a pretty good time did come. Jim was not entirely happy,"
9396,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"because he could not prove his innocence, but he found that no one had"
9397,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,been told of his supposed guilt.
9398,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9399,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Mrs. Turner had not said a word about her missing spoon to any one.
9400,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I will give him another chance to begin right,” she had said to her"
9401,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"husband. And Mr. Turner had replied, “I don’t believe he took it any"
9402,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,more than I did; so what’s the good of making a fuss about nothing?”
9403,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9404,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"No fuss had been made; but Mrs. Turner had said to her little daughter,"
9405,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"when she started for school the morning after Jim’s departure, “Nelly,"
9406,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,you must be careful not to say a single word to anybody about Jim. But
9407,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"I don’t want you to ask him to come here, and it’s just as well for you"
9408,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,not to play with him much.”
9409,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9410,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“It is too bad,” said Nelly. But she was an obedient little girl, and"
9411,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"the first time Jim came to school, when she saw that he hardly dared to"
9412,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,look at her she thought that it would be better to tell him the truth.
9413,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9414,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,[Illustration: OPINIONS DIFFER RESPECTING JIM.]
9415,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9416,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"So at recess she called him, and asked him to go with her on the road,"
9417,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,where no one would hear them; then she said:
9418,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9419,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Jim, I want to tell you something. Mamma told me I must not ask you to"
9420,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"come to the farm any more, and that I must not play with you much, and"
9421,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"so I won’t do it. But I like you just the same, and I will give you an"
9422,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,apple every day to say we are friends.”
9423,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9424,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Nelly was as good as her word. Every morning, at recess, she gave Jim a"
9425,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"small red and yellow “lady-apple,” which she had rubbed hard to make it"
9426,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"shine, and which was one of the two apples her father gave her when she"
9427,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"went to school; and the “lady-apples” were all kept for her, because"
9428,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"she said they were so good and so pretty--“just like my little girl,”"
9429,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Mr. Turner said.
9430,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9431,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,And what do you suppose Jim did with his apples?
9432,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9433,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Eat them. No, not he!"
9434,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9435,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Every time Nelly gave him an apple, he put it in his pocket and took"
9436,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"it home. Then in the evening before going to bed, he made a hole in"
9437,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"it--the apple, not in the bed--and strung it on a piece of twine which"
9438,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,hung from a nail in the window-sash in his little room.
9439,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9440,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"The poor apples got brown, and wrinkled, and dry, but they were very"
9441,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"precious to Jim, but every one of them said to him, as plain as an"
9442,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,apple can speak: “I like you just the same.”
9443,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9444,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,And so the winter passed away quietly. Mrs. Martin became very fond of
9445,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Jim; she said he was so smart and so handy about the house she didn’t
9446,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"know what she would do without him, and she didn’t think boys were any"
9447,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,trouble at all.
9448,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9449,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"But, alas, how little we know what may happen!"
9450,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9451,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Spring had come, and house-cleaning had come with it. Mrs. Martin had a"
9452,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,nice “best-room” which she never used except for half an hour on Sunday
9453,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"afternoons during the summer, and which was always as clean as clean"
9454,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"can be. But in Spring, it had to be made cleaner, if possible; summer"
9455,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,could not come till that was done.
9456,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9457,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"So the carpet was taken up, shaken, and put down again, and as Jim had"
9458,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"helped in the shaking, Mrs. Martin kindly invited him to come in, and"
9459,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,admire the room.
9460,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9461,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,“What a pretty room it is!” said Jim; “why don’t you live in it?”
9462,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9463,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Because it would wear out the carpet, and it is more comfortable in"
9464,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,the sitting-room;” answered Mrs. Martin. Then she showed him a few
9465,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"books, boxes, and other works of art which were spread out on the big"
9466,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"round table, and Jim admired everything."
9467,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9468,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Among Mrs. Martin’s treasures, there was a brown morocco “Keepsake,”"
9469,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"containing a pair of scissors, a silver thimble, and a needle-case."
9470,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,It had belonged to Mrs. Martin’s little daughter who had died several
9471,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"years before, and when Mrs. Martin went into the best-room on Sunday"
9472,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"afternoons she always opened the “Keepsake,” and thought of the little"
9473,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"hands that had played with it, long ago. And now as a reward of merit,"
9474,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,she showed it to Jim.
9475,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9476,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,“It is the prettiest thing I ever saw!” said Jim; “when I am rich I
9477,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,will give Nellie Turner one just like it.”
9478,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9479,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“She will have to wait some time, I guess,” said Mrs. Martin, laughing."
9480,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9481,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Then they looked at the pictures of George Washington shaking hands
9482,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"with nobody, and of his wife, looking very sweet and handsome."
9483,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9484,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“You are so great at stringing up things, Jimmy,” said Mrs. Martin"
9485,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"with a funny look, “I want you to hang up these pictures for me, will"
9486,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,you?”
9487,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9488,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“I will,” said Jim, blushing a little as he thought of his string of"
9489,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,apples; “I will do it next Saturday.”
9490,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9491,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Jim kept his promise. The pictures were hung in the best light and made
9492,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"the room look so much prettier, that even Spot, who had been a silent"
9493,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"observer, could keep still no longer, and barked his approbation. Then"
9494,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"the blinds and windows were closed, the door locked, and the best-room"
9495,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,was left to quiet and darkness.
9496,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9497,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"The next day being Sunday, Mrs. Martin paid her usual afternoon visit"
9498,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"to the best-room. She admired the pictures a little while, then she"
9499,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,went to the round table to take up the Keepsake; but the Keepsake was
9500,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,not there.
9501,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9502,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"She looked all over the table and under it, behind every chair and"
9503,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"in every corner, but she did not find it. “I wonder where it can be?"
9504,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Perhaps I took it to the sitting-room without thinking,” said Mrs."
9505,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Martin to herself.
9506,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9507,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"She went back to the sitting-room and looked everywhere, but found no"
9508,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,Keepsake. Then she sat down in her rocking-chair and tried to think
9509,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"about something else, but could only say to herself: “I wonder where it"
9510,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,is!”
9511,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9512,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim came into the room with a new Sunday-school book, which he began to"
9513,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"read. Mrs. Martin looked at him while he read, but for some reason she"
9514,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,did not say anything to him about the Keepsake.
9515,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9516,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"The next morning she put off her washing, and as soon as Jim had gone"
9517,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,to school she began to search the whole house; but no Keepsake did she
9518,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,find.
9519,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9520,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“It can’t be, it can’t be,” she said with tears in her eyes; “but I"
9521,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,_must_ look in his room--perhaps he took it up to look at--he said it
9522,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,was so pretty.”
9523,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9524,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin went up to Jim’s room, but found nothing there except his"
9525,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"clothes, the apples, and a few little treasures such as boys have."
9526,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9527,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Then she fell on her knees by Jim’s bed, and cried with all her heart."
9528,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No, I won’t believe it till I have to,” she said at last. “Poor boy;"
9529,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"it’s hard on him and he has been so good, too! But I must speak to him"
9530,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"about it, and if he has done wrong I must try to be patient with him.”"
9531,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9532,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"When Jim came home from school in the afternoon, Mrs. Martin called him"
9533,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"into the sitting-room. “Come here, Jim,” she said; “I want to speak to"
9534,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,you.”
9535,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9536,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"She had said it very kindly, but there was something in her voice that"
9537,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,made Jim feel a little queer.
9538,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9539,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"He came in and stood before her, and she said to him: “Jim do you know"
9540,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,what has become of that pretty Keepsake I showed you the other day? I
9541,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"can’t find it anywhere, and I have looked and looked.”"
9542,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9543,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,[Illustration: “I LIKE YOU JUST THE SAME! I LIKE YOU JUST THE SAME!”]
9544,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9545,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No,” said Jim boldly, “I havn’t seen it since. I hope it isn’t lost.”"
9546,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Then he stopped, and his face blushed crimson. There was something in"
9547,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin’s eyes, as well as in her voice, that reminded him of his"
9548,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,trouble about the silver-spoon.
9549,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9550,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,“Oh! you don’t think”--he cried out.
9551,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9552,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,But he could say no more--Mrs. Martin had him in her arms the next
9553,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,moment.
9554,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9555,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No, I _don’t_ think,” she said, “I don’t, my boy! not for the world I"
9556,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"wouldn’t! only I can’t find it, and--and--”"
9557,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9558,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Let me look for it,” said Jim."
9559,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9560,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"They looked again together, but with no success. That night there were"
9561,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"two heavy hearts in the quiet little house, and the next morning there"
9562,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,were two pair of red eyes at the breakfast table.
9563,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9564,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“You must not grieve so, Jim,” said Mrs. Martin. “I hope it will all"
9565,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"come out right; we must try to bear it well, and go to work as if"
9566,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,nothing had happened.”
9567,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9568,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"But she could not follow her own advice, and the washing remained"
9569,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,undone.
9570,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9571,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim did not go to school, and spent his time looking everywhere in the"
9572,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"orchard and in the garden, while Spot followed him, wondering what was"
9573,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,the matter.
9574,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9575,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"No one had any appetite for dinner, and after trying in vain to eat a"
9576,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"potato, Jim went up to his room."
9577,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9578,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin tried to sit still, and sew, but she could not bear it"
9579,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"long; and when she heard the children coming from school, she went to"
9580,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,the gate to look at them; they were so happy that it seemed to do her
9581,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,good.
9582,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9583,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Is Jimmy sick?” asked little Nelly, stopping on her way."
9584,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9585,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“No,” said Mrs. Martin; “but he’s been busy, and couldn’t go to school.”"
9586,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9587,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Nelly wanted to send him a nice russet apple she had kept for him, but"
9588,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,she did not quite dare to do it because Mrs. Martin looked so sober.
9589,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9590,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim heard her voice from his room, but he did not dare to show himself."
9591,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“She won’t like me just the same when she hears of this,” he thought;"
9592,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,and he felt as if he had not a friend in the world. “I would give my
9593,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"head to find that thing,” he said; “she don’t believe I took it, but"
9594,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"she believes it too; I shall have to go away from here, and I don’t"
9595,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"care what becomes of me, anyway.”"
9596,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9597,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin stood at the gate a little while watching the children,"
9598,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,then she went to the garden to look at her hot-beds--two large pine
9599,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"boxes in which lettuce, radishes, and tomatoes were doing their best to"
9600,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,grow fast and green.
9601,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9602,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"When she came near the beds, she saw Spot stretched on the ground,"
9603,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"enjoying an old bone, as she thought."
9604,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9605,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“This won’t do, Spot,” she said; “I don’t want you to bring your bones"
9606,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,here. Go away!”
9607,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9608,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Spot did not seem to mind her at all, so she came a little nearer to"
9609,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,make a personal impression upon him with the toe of her shoe.
9610,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9611,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Spot growled, and turned away his head a little, and as he did so, a"
9612,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,little silver thimble fell out of the old bone and rolled upon the
9613,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,ground.
9614,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9615,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“My Keepsake!” exclaimed Mrs. Martin. And, as she said afterward, she"
9616,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,was so taken by surprise you could have knocked her down with a feather.
9617,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9618,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,She waited half a minute to get her breath when she picked up the
9619,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"thimble and ran toward the house, calling with all her might: “Jim,"
9620,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim, here it is! here, come!”"
9621,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9622,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Jim never remembered how he got down stairs, but there he was staring"
9623,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"at the thimble, and so happy that he couldn’t even begin to say a word."
9624,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9625,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Mrs. Martin was just explaining to him: “you see it was Spot, and the"
9626,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"bone, and the hot-bed fell out of it, and I knew it was not you”--when,"
9627,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"they heard a big voice calling from the road: “Jim, Jim, come out here"
9628,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,quick!”
9629,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9630,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"They looked round, and saw farmer Turner running as fast as such a fat"
9631,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"man could run, and waving something shiny over his head."
9632,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9633,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"“Here it is!” he said, “here is that blessed spoon! I was a-plowing"
9634,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"in a corner of the orchard, when I turned up a soft stone made of red"
9635,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"morocco, with a silver spoon in it. Didn’t I tell you so? I never"
9636,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,believed it. Hallo! what’s the matter?”
9637,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9638,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,The matter was a most wonderful scramble. Mrs. Turner and little Nelly
9639,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"had run across lots, and here they were, talking, and laughing, and"
9640,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"crying. Everybody hugged everybody else, and everybody was so glad"
9641,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"she was so sorry, or so sorry she was so glad--farmer Turner vowed he"
9642,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,couldn’t tell which it was most.
9643,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9644,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"At last they made out that they were all very glad, and Mrs. Martin"
9645,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"invited them all to stay to tea. They accepted the invitation, and such"
9646,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,a tea-party never took place anywhere--not even in Boston--for the
9647,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"company had joy as well as hot biscuits, and happiness as well as cake."
9648,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9649,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"Spot was scolded and forgiven, and wagged his tail so hard that it is a"
9650,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,wonder it didn’t come off.
9651,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9652,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"As for Jim, he got kisses enough that evening to last him for a"
9653,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,lifetime.
9654,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9655,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"This is the true end to a true story, but not the last end by any means."
9656,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,
9657,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"For Jim is now a “boy” twenty-one years old, and Nelly “likes him just"
9658,BY GRANDMERE JULIE.,"the same,” only a great deal more."

9669,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.
9670,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9671,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9672,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"In the December of 1752, Roger Lippett was a boy of ten years, and"
9673,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Dan,” his dog, was six months old and had to be taught to swim. To"
9674,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"this pleasing duty Roger addressed himself whenever he had a chance,"
9675,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and the only draw-back was that his mother would allow no wet dog upon
9676,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"her sanded floor, and as Roger had to be wherever Dan was, he had often"
9677,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,a tedious time in waiting for such a very curly dog to get dry.
9678,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9679,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"But this Sunday afternoon the two had taken a long walk after the swim,"
9680,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and when they came back Dan was dry and uncommonly clean and white.
9681,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9682,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,In the little parlor Roger found the usual Sunday company. In an
9683,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"arm-chair on one side of the fireplace sat Simon Mitchels, the"
9684,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"school-master; opposite to him, on a three-legged stool, was Caleb"
9685,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Dawe, the parish clerk, and on the settle, in front of the fire, was"
9686,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Roger’s cousin, old Forbes the miller, and short Daniel Green, the"
9687,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"sexton. His mother sat in her high-backed chair by the window, and"
9688,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Phœbe Rogers’ younger sister was near her playing gleefully with a
9689,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,kitten.
9690,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9691,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“Christmas!” said Caleb; “there’ll be no Christmas! What between the
9692,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"New Way and the Old Way, we’ll all go astray. It is a popish innovation"
9693,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"at the best, and if King George knew his duty, he’d put his foot on it.”"
9694,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9695,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Nonsense!” said Simon, testily; “when a thing is wrong, ’tis wrong,"
9696,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"and if you mean to make it right, you must not mind a little temporary"
9697,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"trouble. King George knows that just as well as any one, and so do you!"
9698,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,If you wanted a new roof on your house you would first have to take the
9699,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,old one off.”
9700,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9701,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Not Caleb,” said old Forbes. “Caleb ’d patch the old one until it was"
9702,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,new-made over.”
9703,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9704,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Yes,” replied Simon, “that is just what we have been doing with the"
9705,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"year--patching and patching. Now here comes King George, and says,"
9706,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"‘Look here, this is 1752, and if we are ever going to have a decent"
9707,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"regular year with the proper number of days in it, ’tis time we were"
9708,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,about it.’ But you people who patch roofs object because it alters the
9709,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"dates for one year a day or two. Thanks be to the King, however, he has"
9710,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the power.”
9711,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9712,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“Alters the dates a day or two!” repeated Caleb. “You yourself said the
9713,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,New Way would take eleven days out of the year.”
9714,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9715,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Only this year,” Simon replied; “afterward it will be all right. It is"
9716,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,but to bring the first of January in the right place.”
9717,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9718,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“It was right enough,” persisted Caleb. “And I say no one, king or no"
9719,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"king, has any right to take eleven days away from the English people.”"
9720,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9721,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Then Mistress Margery Lippett spoke:
9722,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9723,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“For my part,” she said, “I think the New Way unchristian. Mistress"
9724,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Duncan, you know, has a fine crowing little boy, and when the squire"
9725,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"asked how old he was, she told him--’twas but a day so ago--three"
9726,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"months and two weeks; and he laughed, and told her she would have to"
9727,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"take the two weeks off. Now _that_ I call unchristian, and not dealing"
9728,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,justly with the child.”
9729,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9730,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"At this the school-master laughed, and taking his pipe out of his"
9731,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"mouth, and pushing his velvet skull-cap a little farther back, he"
9732,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,replied:
9733,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9734,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“They were both right, Mistress Margery. Both of them. The mother"
9735,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,counts by weeks--very good--the squire by the proper calendar. One
9736,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"makes the child three months and two weeks, and she is right; the other"
9737,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"deducts eleven days to fit the calendar, and he, too, is right.”"
9738,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9739,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Out with it,” cried Caleb; “out with such a calendar! Why, the whole"
9740,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"realm will be in confusion. None of us will ever know how old we are,"
9741,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"or when the church-days are due; but I doubt if, in spite of it all,"
9742,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the Pope’s new calendar doesn’t keep the squire’s rent-day straight.
9743,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,They’ll look out for that.”
9744,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9745,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I suppose,” said Simon, “you all think the year was created when the"
9746,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,world was?”
9747,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9748,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Of course it was,” said Mistress Margery; “didn’t He make the day and"
9749,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the night, and do you suppose He would have passed the year over?”"
9750,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9751,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“You are about right,” said Simon; “but the trouble is we are just"
9752,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"finding out what His year is? See here, Roger,” and he turned his head"
9753,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to the boy, “do you know how many different kinds of years we can"
9754,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,reckon?”
9755,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9756,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Not I, master,” said Roger."
9757,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9758,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Well, I’ll tell you. Suppose you wanted a measure of time answering"
9759,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to a year, you might reckon from the time the apples blow to when they"
9760,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"blow again, but if a frost or a blight seize them, you’d be out with"
9761,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"your count, wouldn’t you?”"
9762,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9763,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Truly,” said Mistress Margery, who delighted to see how well Roger"
9764,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,understood his learned master.
9765,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9766,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Well, then,” resumed the teacher, “you would soon find that if you"
9767,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"wanted a regular, unchangeable guide, one unaffected by seasons, by"
9768,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"droughts, heats, or hostile winds, you would look to the skies. You"
9769,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"would, perhaps, if you were wise enough, and had observed--you would"
9770,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,single out some special star; you would take close notice of its
9771,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"position, note its changes, then you would say, ‘When that comes back"
9772,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to the very spot where it was when I began to watch it, that time I"
9773,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,shall count as my year.’ Do you follow me?”
9774,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9775,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That I do,” said Roger."
9776,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9777,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That, then, is one way in which a year was once calculated, and the"
9778,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,star chosen gave three hundred and sixty-five days for a year.”
9779,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9780,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Now that is a calendar, true and unchangeable, and correct beyond what"
9781,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"a Pope can make,” said Caleb."
9782,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9783,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That, Roger,” said Simon, taking no notice of Caleb, “is called a"
9784,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Sidereal year. Now, come you here, Phœbe, and tell me what is a Lunar"
9785,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,year?”
9786,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9787,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“A year of moons,” said Phœbe, her bright eyes dancing."
9788,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9789,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“You have the making of a scholar in you,” said Simon; “’tis a pity you"
9790,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,are a girl. A Lunar year _is_ a year of twelve moons. This Lunar year
9791,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"has but three hundred and fifty-four days, still it served the purposes"
9792,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"of the Chaldeans, the Persians, and Jews."
9793,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9794,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Then there was the Solar year, calculated by the sun; and it and"
9795,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the Lunar year agreed so badly that every three years another lunar
9796,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,month had to be counted in to keep the one from running away from the
9797,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"other. Now, I suppose you all think,” looking at the group around the"
9798,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"fireside, “that all these years began the first of January and ended"
9799,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the thirty-first of December?”
9800,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9801,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“It is but just that they should,” said old Forbes, Caleb disdaining to"
9802,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,speak.
9803,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9804,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“But _they didn’t_,” said Simon. “The Jews began their year in March;"
9805,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"in Greece it began in June, and certain Eastern Christians began theirs"
9806,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,in August.”
9807,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9808,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That isn’t England,” said Caleb, in a tone of contempt."
9809,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9810,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Truly not,” said Simon; “but the English year used to begin the"
9811,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"twenty-fifth of December, until the coronation of William the"
9812,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Conqueror--when was that, Phœbe?”"
9813,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9814,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“In 1066,” said Phœbe, smoothing her teacher’s ruffles with the air of"
9815,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,a petted and privileged child.
9816,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9817,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“It was January the first, 1066,” resumed Simon; “and it was judged so"
9818,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,important an event that it was ordered that ever after _the year should
9819,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,begin on that day_. But I can tell you worse than that of England.
9820,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"There are places in England to-day, where they reckon their year from"
9821,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the twenty-fifth of March!
9822,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9823,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“But long before William’s time,” he continued, “the Romans had ideas,"
9824,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and they thought it wise to straighten up the year for their own use.
9825,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"So Julius Cæsar--when did he begin to reign, Phœbe?”"
9826,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9827,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I don’t know,” said she."
9828,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9829,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“In 63, B. C.” said Roger, eagerly."
9830,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9831,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“No, that was Cæsar Augustus, and we are coming to him. Julius Cæsar"
9832,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"lived before that, and he arranged the years so that all the even"
9833,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"numbers among the months, except February, had thirty days, and all the"
9834,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,odd ones thirty-one. Do you understand that?”
9835,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9836,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Not I,” said Phœbe, frankly."
9837,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9838,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“January is the first month; it is not an even number?”
9839,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9840,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“No,” said Phœbe."
9841,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9842,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“March is the third month, and so is not an even number?”"
9843,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9844,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“No,” said Phœbe again."
9845,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9846,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“They each then, being odd, had thirty-one days, while May and July,"
9847,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"and the other even months, except February, had thirty days. That was"
9848,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"all very easy, and the length of the year seemed settled; but when"
9849,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Cæsar Augustus came on the throne he was not satisfied. ‘What,’ said"
9850,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"he, ‘shall Julius Cæsar in his month of July have thirty-one days, and"
9851,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"I, in my month of August, have but thirty!’ And so he at once made"
9852,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,August longer.”
9853,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9854,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“He was very foolish,” said Phœbe. “I was born in February, wasn’t I,"
9855,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"mother? and _I_ don’t care because Roger was born in December, when"
9856,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,there are more days.”
9857,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9858,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“But you are not a Cæsar,” replied her teacher. “At any rate this Cæsar"
9859,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"made the year all wrong again; and in 1582 Gregory, who was Pope, set"
9860,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to work to help matters. He had to drop some days, I believe, in the"
9861,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"first year just as we are going to now. The French and Italian people,"
9862,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"and some others, were wise enough to see this improvement at once, and"
9863,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"they adopted Pope Gregory’s year; but we, for nearly two hundred years"
9864,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"more, have been getting along with the old way, and our new year comes"
9865,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"ahead of almost everybody else’s, and those who travel get their dates"
9866,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,badly mixed.”
9867,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9868,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Surely,” said Roger, “it _would_ be best to have the same year the"
9869,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,world over.”
9870,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9871,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“So King George thinks,” said Simon; “but Caleb here says not, and"
9872,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"quarrels because eleven days have to be dropped out of this one year,"
9873,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"so that for all aftertime the years, months, and days, will go on in an"
9874,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"even, regular and seemly manner.”"
9875,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9876,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“And I rightly object,” replied Caleb; “and when the proper"
9877,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Christmas-day comes I shall keep it, and no king, no pope, and no"
9878,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Julius Cæsar, _nobody_, shall ever make me change the blessed day for"
9879,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,any other falsely called by its name.” And Caleb put his hands to his
9880,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"three-legged stool, and lifting it and himself at the same moment,"
9881,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,brought it down with a bang.
9882,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9883,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Well, we can’t go wrong about Christmas-day,” said Mistress Margery,"
9884,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“if we but follow the blooming of the Glastonbury Thorn.”
9885,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9886,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That we cannot,” answered old Forbes. “For hundreds and hundreds of"
9887,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"years, long before popes or calendars were thought of, that Thorn has"
9888,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"bloomed every Christmas Eve, and not only the one at Glastonbury, but"
9889,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,every sacred slip cut from it and planted has remembered the birthday
9890,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,of The Child _and never failed to blossom_!”
9891,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9892,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That is all superstition,” said Simon; “the plant naturally blossoms"
9893,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,twice a year--that is all.”
9894,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9895,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Indeed that is not all,” cried Mistress Margery. “I was born and"
9896,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"raised at Quainton, but seven miles from here, and there, as you all"
9897,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"know, is a fine tree grown from a Glastonbury slip, and many’s the time"
9898,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"when, with the whole village, have I gone out to see the blooming.”"
9899,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9900,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“And when did it bloom, mother?” asked Phœbe."
9901,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9902,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Always on Christmas Eve. The blossoms were snow white, and by"
9903,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Christmas night they were gone.”
9904,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9905,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“But, mother,” said Roger, “why is the Glastonbury tree the best, if"
9906,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,this at Quainton blooms as well?”
9907,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9908,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Because it was the first one planted, of course,” said Mistress"
9909,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Margery; “I know no other reason.”
9910,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9911,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Phœbe saw the little smile upon Simon’s face, and taking his coat"
9912,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"lappets in both hands, she bent her pretty little head in front of his,"
9913,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and said:
9914,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9915,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Tell us, master.”"
9916,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9917,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“You think,” he answered, “that I must know all the old wives’ stories?"
9918,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Well, I will tell you this one. Joseph of Arimathea, you know, gave his"
9919,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,sepulchre to receive the body of the Lord. Into it the blessed angels
9920,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"went, and out from it, upon the third day, came the Risen Saviour."
9921,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"From that hour, until the one in which he saw the Lord return unto"
9922,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the skies, Joseph followed Him, and then all Palestine became to him"
9923,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,empty and weary. There were people who doubted the resurrection; people
9924,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,who said that Joseph himself was one who aided in a deception; and
9925,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"so, tired of it all, he took his staff in hand and wandered until he"
9926,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"came to England, and to Glastonbury. On Christmas-day he climbed the"
9927,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"hill where the old, old church now stands, and here, in sign that his"
9928,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"wanderings were over, he planted his staff. At once it rooted, it shot"
9929,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"forth leaves, it blossomed, and the scent of the milk-white flowers"
9930,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,filled the air. From that time to the days when Charles and Cromwell
9931,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"fought, it has blossomed on Christmas Eve; but then it was cut down by"
9932,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"some impious hand, yet still all the slips, the twigs, which had been"
9933,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"cut off by pilgrims, have kept the sacred birthday; and as your mother"
9934,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"says, the one in Quainton can as well as the other decide between the"
9935,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Old calendar and the New.”
9936,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9937,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I am glad to hear thee say so,” exclaimed Mistress Margery, with"
9938,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"brightening eyes, “and if you choose to journey with us when next we go"
9939,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to Quainton, you are heartily welcome to our company, and I’ll bespeak"
9940,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"thee a honest welcome from my sister who, like my Phœbe here, has a"
9941,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,strong leaning toward learning.”
9942,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9943,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Nay,” said the school-master, looking a little ashamed of himself; “I"
9944,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,but told the story to amuse the child. The plant is merely a sort of
9945,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"hawthorn from Aleppo, and regularly blooms twice in the year, if the"
9946,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,weather be but mild.”
9947,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9948,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,But although Mistress Margery was much disappointed that he had no
9949,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"desire to go to Quainton, she found both Roger and Phœbe bent upon"
9950,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,witnessing the Christmas blooming.
9951,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9952,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I don’t know,” said she, lightly, “but that between the Old Way, and"
9953,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the New, the Thorn will be confused, and not know when it should bloom.”"
9954,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9955,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“It will not bloom on your new Christmas, take my word for that,” said"
9956,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Forbes; “and if the children will wait until the true day comes, I"
9957,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"myself will take them along, for I have a mind to see it myself.”"
9958,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9959,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“But, cousin Forbes,” said Phœbe, “it _may_ bloom on the new day.”"
9960,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9961,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,The little people had their way. On the morning of the twenty-fourth
9962,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"of December, by the New Style, but the thirteenth by Caleb’s count,"
9963,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Roger and Phœbe started off, mounted on their mother’s own steady"
9964,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"white horse, Phœbe behind her brother, with the bag containing their"
9965,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"holiday clothes, while to Roger was given their lunch, and a bottle"
9966,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"of blackberry wine for their aunt, with whom they were to lodge in"
9967,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Quainton.
9968,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9969,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"The morning was cold and bleak, but the children rode merrily on. It"
9970,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"was the first time they had been trusted alone on such an expedition,"
9971,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and Phœbe at once proposed that they should play that Roger was a
9972,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"wandering knight, and she one of the fair, distressed damsels who were"
9973,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,always met by knights when on their travels.
9974,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9975,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I would,” said Roger, “if you could find another knight to whom I"
9976,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"could give battle, but it is rather tame to be pacing along here with"
9977,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"you behind me, and no danger ahead.”"
9978,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9979,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I wish then,” said Phœbe, “that mother had not wanted cousin Forbes’"
9980,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"horse, for, perhaps, he would have lent it to us, and then, with such a"
9981,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"horse, we could have been a knight and a lady out hawking, and I would"
9982,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,have given you a race.”
9983,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9984,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“That would have been a rarely good plan,” said Roger, looking up the"
9985,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"level road, “and I do not like to lose it. Ho, lady,” he cried, looking"
9986,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"behind him, “thy father is in pursuit!” And clapping both feet to the"
9987,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"sides of the horse, he put him to his speed."
9988,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9989,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Oh, Roger! oh, sir Knight!” exclaimed Phœbe, “my hood--if I could but"
9990,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,tie it!”
9991,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9992,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“I cannot wait for hoods,” said the knight, in a stern voice; “when we"
9993,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"reach my castle thou shalt have twenty-two, and a crown beside.”"
9994,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
9995,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"The lady would not have doubted this for the world, but she"
9996,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"nevertheless loosened one hand, clinging desperately to her protector"
9997,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"with the other, and pulled off the hood, held it, and clutched her"
9998,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"knight who, with cries of “on Selim, on!” urged poor old Dobbin to his"
9999,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,best.
10000,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10001,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"There was, indeed, a clatter of horses’ hoofs behind, and with it a"
10002,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"loud cry, Phœbe turned her head."
10003,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10004,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Oh, sir Knight!” she cried with very short breath; “my father _is_"
10005,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"near at hand! Hasten, oh, hasten!”"
10006,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10007,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"And sure enough, some one was! He was short and stout, and looked"
10008,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,much more like a butcher’s boy than a gentle lady’s father; and he
10009,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"was certainly in pursuit, and he called again and again, but the only"
10010,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,effect was to make the flying knight more vigorously kick the sides of
10011,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"his horse, and more vehemently push on. But as fortune would have it"
10012,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the father’s horse was the swiftest, and in spite of the knight’s best"
10013,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,efforts he was down along-side.
10014,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10015,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“What do you mean?” he exclaimed, “by racing off in this way! If I"
10016,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,didn’t know that was Mistress Margery Lippett’s horse I would have let
10017,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"you go on, seeing that you haven’t sense enough to know he has lost a"
10018,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,shoe.”
10019,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10020,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,At this Roger quickly stopped his steed.
10021,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10022,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Which one?” he exclaimed--“Here Phœbe, I must get down--the hind foot"
10023,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,shoe is gone.”
10024,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10025,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,[Illustration: ON THE ROAD ONCE MORE.]
10026,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10027,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Oh, Roger,” cried Phœbe, “what would mother say! She is so careful of"
10028,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Dobbin, and she charged us to take heed of him; and Roger, _must_ we go"
10029,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"home, do you think?”"
10030,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10031,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Of course not,” replied Roger, “and see here Dick,” for he now"
10032,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"recognized his pursuer, “cannot you tell me where to find a blacksmith?”"
10033,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10034,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“There is one at Torrey,” said Dick, “a mile down that road. It is the"
10035,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"nearest place, but it will take you out of your way, if you are going"
10036,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"to the Blooming as am I, who must be off, or my master will take my"
10037,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,ears in pay for my tarrying.”
10038,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10039,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"It was easy enough to find the blacksmith’s shop, but the blacksmith"
10040,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"was not there, although he would soon be back, his wife said. Roger"
10041,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"tied his horse, and then he and Phœbe wandered about until he declared"
10042,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"it was lunch time; so they came back, and were about to eat their lunch"
10043,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"by the stile, when the smith’s wife saw them, and calling them into her"
10044,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"kitchen, spread a table for them, and added a cold pie and some milk to"
10045,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,their repast.
10046,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10047,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"But still the man did not come, and Roger waited in great impatience."
10048,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"He was almost ready to start off again for Quainton, but Phœbe was so"
10049,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,sure that the penalty of injuring Dobbin would be the never trusting
10050,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"of them alone again, that he was afraid to risk it. Then there came a"
10051,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"man with two horses to be shod, and he waited and scolded and stamped"
10052,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"his feet, and then the blacksmith came, but he at once attended to the"
10053,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"man, and so Dobbin had to wait. But at last Dobbin was shod, and Roger"
10054,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"mounted, and then the blacksmith lifted Phœbe up."
10055,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10056,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“Where are you going?” said the smith.
10057,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10058,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“To Quainton,” replied Roger; “we are going to see the Blooming.”"
10059,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10060,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Why, so are we,” said the man. “It is late for you children to be on"
10061,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the road. If I had known all this I would have shod your horse first.
10062,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,You had better wait for us.”
10063,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10064,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Oh, no,” replied Phœbe, “we have first to go to our aunt’s. It would"
10065,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,frighten her greatly to have us come so late.”
10066,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10067,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Roger looked down the road. It was certainly late in the afternoon, but"
10068,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the road was direct, and so he said good-by, and off old Dobbin trotted."
10069,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10070,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,It now seemed as if the mile out of the way had stretched itself to
10071,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"two, and it was fast growing dark when they reached a mile-stone three"
10072,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,miles from Quainton. Little Phœbe was certain they should be lost
10073,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,riding on in the dark; but not so Roger.
10074,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10075,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“There is no fear of that,” said he stoutly, “we will meet others"
10076,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,going.”
10077,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10078,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,And Roger was right. The nearer they got to Quainton the greater became
10079,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the throng of people, and they were one and all going to the Blooming."
10080,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10081,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"They came from the lanes, from over the fields, out of every hamlet,"
10082,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,from every road. They were in wagons; they were on foot and on
10083,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"horse-back; two old ladies were in a sedan-chair, and at last they"
10084,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"overtook an old man carried like “a lady to London,” by two great sons."
10085,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"As it grew dark and darker, and no stars came out to brighten the sky,"
10086,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"wandering lights began to shine forth and torches, candles, lanterns,"
10087,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,gleamed out on the roadside and flickered in the bushes and among the
10088,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,trees. There was in every group much talking and discussion; and it was
10089,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"easy to be seen that most of the people were of Caleb’s opinion, and"
10090,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,doubted the new way of arranging the year; but it was equally clear
10091,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,that they meant the slip from the Glastonbury thorn to decide the
10092,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,matter for them.
10093,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10094,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Roger kept close behind a travelling-carriage which was attended by two
10095,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"horsemen carrying torches, and greatly to his joy it went into Quainton"
10096,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and passed directly by his aunt’s home.
10097,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10098,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“There is no use in stopping,” cried Phœbe, as the house came in sight,"
10099,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“it is all shut up and dark, and aunt Katherine has surely gone with"
10100,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,the others.”
10101,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10102,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"This was so likely to be the case that Roger urged on his horse, and"
10103,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,again overtook the carriage. When they reached the field in which the
10104,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Thorn-tree stood it was already filled with flickering, moving lights,"
10105,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and was all astir with people and voices.
10106,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10107,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Roger jumped down, lifted Phœbe, and then tying Dobbin to an oak"
10108,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"sapling which still rustled with dried and brown leaves, he turned to"
10109,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"his sister and, hand in hand, they hastened to where the Thorn was"
10110,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"growing, and around which stood a large group."
10111,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10112,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"The tree was bare, leafless, and looked as if dead."
10113,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10114,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“If that blooms to-night,” said a woman, “’twill be a miracle.”"
10115,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10116,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“It is always a miracle,” said a grave and sober-looking man by her"
10117,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,side.
10118,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10119,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Phœbe held closely to her brother’s hand; but the scene was too
10120,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"wonderful to promise much talking on her part. The darkness, the dim"
10121,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"and shadowy trees and bushes, the tramping of unseen horses, the"
10122,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"confusion of voices, the laughing and complaining of children, the"
10123,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"moving lights, the thronging people, and in the centre of it all a ring"
10124,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"of light and a dense group around the tree, made a wonderful picture."
10125,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10126,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Nearer and nearer the people pressed, the parish beadle in advance,"
10127,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"with his watch in his hand, a man by his side swinging his lantern so"
10128,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,that the light would fall directly upon it. Many eyes were bent on it.
10129,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10130,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"It grew late, and the crowd became silent, gathering closer around the"
10131,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,tree.
10132,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10133,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“Twenty minutes of twelve--a quarter of twelve--five minutes of
10134,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,twelve!” proclaimed the beadle.
10135,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10136,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"The tree was still bare, and gave no signs of bloom."
10137,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10138,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“_Twelve o’clock!_”
10139,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10140,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"And off in the distance pealed the bells, ushering in King George’s"
10141,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Christmas.
10142,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10143,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,The torches flared upon the tree; the people in the rear of the crowd
10144,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,stood on tiptoe and craned their necks to see the milk-white bloom.
10145,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10146,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,But the tree was silent and bare!
10147,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10148,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,King George could not be right.
10149,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10150,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,The next day aunt Katherine came out of the room where she was putting
10151,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,her bed linen away in the lavender-scented press.
10152,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10153,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“The church-bells have done ringing,” she said. “Run, children, and see"
10154,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,if any one has gone.”
10155,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10156,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"Off flew Phœbe with Roger after her, and when she reached the"
10157,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"church-yard, the only person she saw was Marian Leesh, a neighbor’s"
10158,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"child, looking over the wall at the minister and the clerk who were"
10159,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,standing by the door. When the clergyman saw Phœbe he came toward her.
10160,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10161,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Child,” he said, “what is the meaning of this? Is it possible that the"
10162,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,people refuse to keep the Christmas-day? Where is your family?”
10163,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10164,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“We do not belong here,” said Phœbe; “we came to see the Blooming. We"
10165,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"are at aunt Katherine’s, and she is looking over her linen press.”"
10166,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10167,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,The minister frowned.
10168,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10169,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,“And the rest of the people?”
10170,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10171,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“They are all at work,” cried Roger, coming up; “the cooper has his"
10172,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"shop open, and the mercer is selling, and they have all put away the"
10173,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"cakes and the mistletoe, and there is to be no Christmas until the true"
10174,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,day comes.”
10175,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10176,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“Nonsense!” cried the minister. “Jacob, bring me my hat!” and without"
10177,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,taking off his gown he strode down into the village.
10178,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10179,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"But it was all in vain; the minister talked and scolded, but the people"
10180,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,went on with their work. They would not go to church; they would not
10181,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,sing their carols nor hang holly and mistletoe boughs.
10182,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10183,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"“This New Way might do for lords and ladies,” they said, “but as for"
10184,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"them the Christmas kept by their fathers, and marked by the blooming of"
10185,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the Thorn, was their Christmas,” and so the sexton closed the church,"
10186,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,and the discomfited minister went home; and he was the only person in
10187,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Quainton who that day ate a Christmas dinner.
10188,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10189,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"When the news came to London and to the court of how these people,"
10190,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"and others in different villages, refused to adopt the New Style, the"
10191,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,little fat king and his lords and ladies laughed; but they soon found
10192,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"it was a serious matter, and so it was ordered that the churches should"
10193,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,be opened also on “old Christmas” and sermons preached on that day
10194,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,wherever the people wished them. And thus it was that our sixth of
10195,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"January, known as “Twelfth Night,” “little,” or “old Christmas,” came"
10196,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,to be a holiday.
10197,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10198,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,But Roger and Phœbe spent one year of their lives without a Christmas.
10199,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"They returned home upon the twenty-sixth, and found that there the New"
10200,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,Christmas had been kept; and as they could not go back to Quainton when
10201,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"the Old Christmas came, they missed it altogether."
10202,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,
10203,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,As for the Thorn-tree! Who can tell whether it still blooms? In the
10204,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"chronicles which tell of the Glastonbury bush, and of the Quainton"
10205,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,"excitement, there is no mention made of its after blooming; and the"
10206,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,chances are Phœbe’s mother was a true prophet when she said it was
10207,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,possible that between the Old Style and the New Style the Thorn would
10208,BY LOUISE STOCKTON.,become confused and bloom no more for any Christmas-day.

10221,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"peeping behind a large ash-barrel, and, with wide-open eyes, uttered"
10222,BY MARY D. BRINE.,this exclamation. So early that only a few enterprising milkmen and
10223,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"extra smart market-men were about the street, and nobody but Midget had"
10224,BY MARY D. BRINE.,heard the feeble cry which startled her and led to an inquisitive peep
10225,BY MARY D. BRINE.,behind the barrel.
10226,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10227,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It was in an alley-way where piles of rubbish, all sorts of odds and"
10228,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"ends, and much that was impure and disagreeable, had it all their own"
10229,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"way from dawn till night, that Midget was standing this chilly morning."
10230,BY MARY D. BRINE.,And “O my sakes!” escaped her lips once again before she ventured to
10231,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"stop staring and begin work. No wonder she stared, for on the ground,"
10232,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"surrounded by bits of broken crockery and discarded ale-bottles,"
10233,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"half-choked with the dust of ashes, and carelessly wrapped in a"
10234,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"dilapidated old shawl, a baby was lying, stretching little thin arms"
10235,BY MARY D. BRINE.,helplessly into the narrow space between the high brick wall and the
10236,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"barrel, and testifying by feeble wails its need of timely assistance."
10237,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Midget was so shocked and surprised at first that she could only give
10238,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"vent to her favorite exclamation as above, but presently her small"
10239,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"shoulder was pressed against the barrel, and after much tugging and"
10240,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"some hard breathing it was shoved aside, and Midget had her arms around"
10241,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the forlorn and neglected baby in a moment.
10242,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10243,BY MARY D. BRINE.,It was just at that part of the fall season when early mornings and
10244,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"evenings are chilly and suggestive of shivers, and baby, who might have"
10245,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"been all night on the ground, was blue with cold and quite savage with"
10246,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"hunger. Midget’s shawl, ragged almost as that which was wrapped about"
10247,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"the baby, was made to do double duty, as she folded the little waif in"
10248,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"her arms, and realized the important fact that she was holding a real,"
10249,BY MARY D. BRINE.,live baby.
10250,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10251,BY MARY D. BRINE.,It was not possible to carry a bundle of wood and baby at the same
10252,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"time, so the bundle which was to help grandma get her cup of tea was"
10253,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"unceremoniously dropped, and the little girl hurried home with her"
10254,BY MARY D. BRINE.,new-found treasure.
10255,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10256,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"While she is hastening over the pavements, her blue eyes dancing with"
10257,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"joy and excitement, we may learn something concerning her and her"
10258,BY MARY D. BRINE.,rather uncomfortable home.
10259,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10260,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget lived with her grandmother, who was both father and mother to"
10261,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the little thing who had never known the care or love of either parent.
10262,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Her father had never, in his best days, been much of a man, and when,"
10263,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"soon after his wife’s death, _he_ was accidentally killed in the"
10264,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"factory where he worked, poor little Midget was left totally unprovided"
10265,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"for, and quite dependent, in her babyhood, upon grandma, who at least"
10266,BY MARY D. BRINE.,was able to pay the small monthly rent of the cellar home to which
10267,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget was taken. The child, because of her small size, had earned"
10268,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"from neighbors the nickname “Midget,” and had reached the age of eight"
10269,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"years, still answering to the title, and almost forgetting her real"
10270,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"name was Maggie. A wild, wilful, and not far from naughty little girl"
10271,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"she was, but her heart was kindly disposed, and held a world of good"
10272,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"intentions and affectionate thoughts, that somehow nobody, not even"
10273,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"grandma, could often get a sight of. She didn’t understand why there"
10274,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"was not a little sister with whom she might play all day, instead of"
10275,BY MARY D. BRINE.,having to go out early in the morning to pick up sticks and chips for
10276,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the fire which cooked their scanty meals.
10277,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10278,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Midget much preferred a game of “ring around a rosy” with the other
10279,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"children, properly called “Les Miserables,” who swarmed about the side"
10280,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"street where she had lived so long, than to work for her daily bread"
10281,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and blue milk, according to granny’s directions. And poor old granny"
10282,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"herself, possessing not much of the virtue called patience, was called"
10283,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"upon by her idea of training a child the way she should go, to give"
10284,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"little Midget many a “cuff on the ear,” and a shaking which roused all"
10285,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"that was naughty in the lassie’s heart, and made the blue eyes snap"
10286,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"very angrily. As for school, Midget had no time for education, but in"
10287,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"some way, she, with several other children, had learned their letters,"
10288,BY MARY D. BRINE.,and could spell cat and dog as well as any school girl. During the day
10289,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"she earned a little by selling papers on the street, and yet I’m sorry"
10290,BY MARY D. BRINE.,to say most of her pennies went in sticks of candy down her little
10291,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"throat, unknown to granny. “If I only had a little sister,” she would"
10292,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"think, excusing herself, “if granny would only buy babies, as other"
10293,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"women do, why I’d be as good as anything, and help her take care of it!"
10294,BY MARY D. BRINE.,I would!”
10295,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10296,BY MARY D. BRINE.,[Illustration: “EH! WHAT’S THAT?”]
10297,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10298,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"But granny _didn’t_ buy babies, and Midget still hated work, and"
10299,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"sometimes there were clouds and sometimes sunshine, and on this very"
10300,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"morning when Midget found the baby she had been saucy to grandma, and"
10301,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"grandma had boxed the little ears, and so it had begun a _very_ cloudy"
10302,BY MARY D. BRINE.,day indeed.
10303,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10304,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"But we must return to Midget, who, ere this, has reached home."
10305,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10306,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"How glad she was, and at the same time how frightened, poor little"
10307,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget! What should she do with the baby, that was the question; and"
10308,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"when at last the cellar was reached, and Midget laid her burden in"
10309,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"grandma’s lap, she asked the question over again."
10310,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10311,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Eh! what’s this?” asked the old woman, lifting her hands and brows"
10312,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"together, while baby, who, in all its life of eighteen months had never"
10313,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"beheld such a queer thing as granny’s broad-frilled cap, opened its"
10314,BY MARY D. BRINE.,mouth and screamed a terrified answer.
10315,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10316,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“’Tain’t only a baby, granny,” exclaimed Midget, patting the wee"
10317,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"stranger’s hands, and trembling lest her grandmother should rise and"
10318,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"drop it. “Only nothin’ but just a baby, and I’m so glad I found it,"
10319,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"ain’t you, granny? ’Cause you see it’s a kind of sister, you know, and"
10320,BY MARY D. BRINE.,you won’t have to buy one.”
10321,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10322,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“Glad?” repeated the old woman, “that I ain’t!” But the rather snappish"
10323,BY MARY D. BRINE.,answer was quite out of keeping with the impulsive kiss laid on the
10324,BY MARY D. BRINE.,little one’s velvety cheek. Midget brightened when she saw granny do
10325,BY MARY D. BRINE.,that.
10326,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10327,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“I say, do you think it’s got any mamma, granny?” she asked."
10328,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10329,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"“_Did_ have, most likely, but reckon her ma wa’n’t good for much,” was"
10330,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"the reply, while the baby, amused by Midget, began to laugh."
10331,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10332,BY MARY D. BRINE.,“I shouldn’t have thought any mother would chuck her baby behind a
10333,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"barrel,” said Midget, thoughtfully. Then she began to plead with her"
10334,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"grandmother that it might be allowed to stay with them, promising such"
10335,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"wonderful things, and such care of it, that granny, who loved babies,"
10336,BY MARY D. BRINE.,and didn’t really know but what a reward might be offered for the
10337,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"child, at last yielded, and promised to keep it at least a few days."
10338,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"And Midget, delighted beyond measure, seemed to feel two years older as"
10339,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"she rocked the little stranger to sleep, and laid it in her own little"
10340,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"straw bed. “I was a stranger and ye took me in,” kept somehow repeating"
10341,BY MARY D. BRINE.,itself in granny’s mind all that day. She had read it in her Bible long
10342,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"ago, and had heard it from the pulpit once, but never before had it"
10343,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"come back so forcibly as to-day. “Well! well! The Lord will provide, I"
10344,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"dare say. And goodness knows, if he don’t, the child will starve along"
10345,BY MARY D. BRINE.,with Midget and her old granny.”
10346,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10347,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"No advertisement appeared in reference to the lost baby, and at the end"
10348,BY MARY D. BRINE.,of a week the little one had grown so dear to the two who had taken her
10349,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"in, that granny decided to keep her “a _little_ longer.”"
10350,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10351,BY MARY D. BRINE.,But what had come over Midget? The frowsy head began to look smooth
10352,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"as the clustering curls would permit, the little, active body, always"
10353,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"bent upon mischief, had busied itself in new ways, and began to look"
10354,BY MARY D. BRINE.,tidy and neat as the unavoidable rags would allow. Hands and face were
10355,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"clean as soap and water could make them, and Midget actually kept her"
10356,BY MARY D. BRINE.,boots laced since baby’s advent into the family. Granny also noticed
10357,BY MARY D. BRINE.,that Midget grumbled less at having to go out in the early dawn for
10358,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"sticks,--in fact, the grumbling in course of time ceased altogether;"
10359,BY MARY D. BRINE.,for Midget was bent upon fattening the baby and making it grow. And how
10360,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"could a baby grow fat unless she kept it nice and warm, and gave it"
10361,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"plenty of food? Granny’s cup of tea would not do for baby, but Midget"
10362,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"drank cold water most of the time, and baby had the blue milk all to"
10363,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"her hungry, healthy little self."
10364,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10365,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"By-and-by, after the little one had been in her new home about three"
10366,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"weeks, and all the children had kissed it and admired it to their"
10367,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"hearts’ content, and all the old crones of the neighborhood had"
10368,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"speculated as to how granny would be able to provide for it, Midget"
10369,BY MARY D. BRINE.,found pleasant work to do in selling cut flowers on the street for a
10370,BY MARY D. BRINE.,florist near by. Such an important little Midget had never before been
10371,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"heard of in that neighborhood, and it was wonderful how long it had"
10372,BY MARY D. BRINE.,been since granny had found it necessary to punish her. No more saucy
10373,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"words, or frowns on the child-face, because there was baby always"
10374,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"watching her little Midget-mamma with wide eyes, and once, just once,"
10375,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Midget saw the baby kick out its tiny foot just as she had naughtily
10376,BY MARY D. BRINE.,kicked a little playmate who ventured to provoke her anger. And as
10377,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget was determined _her_ baby should excel all others, of course"
10378,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"she was careful of her influence. Then, too, she continued to be neat"
10379,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and tidy, lest the baby might turn her sweet face away when a kiss was"
10380,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"wanted, and that would almost have broken Midget’s heart."
10381,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10382,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"The mornings were daily growing colder, and our little girl’s shawl"
10383,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"grew no thicker or warmer, sad to say, as she started early each day"
10384,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"for the flower-stand on Broadway. But Midget kept up a brave heart,"
10385,BY MARY D. BRINE.,and was glad for the little custom she found. How closely she stuck
10386,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"to business, and how patiently she looked forward to the hour when,"
10387,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"released from duty, she would scamper home for a frolic with baby, we"
10388,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"have neither time nor space to describe minutely, but we may say that"
10389,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"with this new happiness in her heart, and with the importance of taking"
10390,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"good care of her baby constantly in her mind, no wonder our little"
10391,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget grew gentle and good, and found the sunshine oftener than she"
10392,BY MARY D. BRINE.,used to.
10393,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10394,BY MARY D. BRINE.,[Illustration: “MIDGET AND HER BABY.”]
10395,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10396,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"And all this time the wee stranger grew pretty and strong, and granny"
10397,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"began to fear lest somebody should claim this bright treasure, which"
10398,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"made the old cellar so happy a place, despite its scanty furniture and"
10399,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"lack of home comfort. But nobody came for it, and finally the winter"
10400,BY MARY D. BRINE.,had slipped by and spring made its appearance.
10401,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10402,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget had laid up a few dollars--think of it, children who read this,"
10403,BY MARY D. BRINE.,a few dollars! probably the sum that some of you spend in candy and
10404,BY MARY D. BRINE.,toys during one day and think nothing of--for a new dress for baby
10405,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and some trifles for granny and herself. She was eight years old, old"
10406,BY MARY D. BRINE.,enough to feel very grand and important when planning her shopping
10407,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"expedition; and indeed, the little girl sadly needed something to wear,"
10408,BY MARY D. BRINE.,if she would still make herself bright and attractive to baby.
10409,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10410,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"When the days grew warm she used to take her baby to the flower-stand,"
10411,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and people passing paused often, as well to admire this bright little"
10412,BY MARY D. BRINE.,nurse and her charge as to purchase the dainty blossoms offered for
10413,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"sale. Then in an hour or so granny would come for the baby, and, taking"
10414,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"her home, leave the small flower vender free to attend to business."
10415,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10416,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Didn’t Midget get tired of selling her flowers all day on the street?
10417,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"O yes, very tired; but the day’s hard work only made her evenings"
10418,BY MARY D. BRINE.,merrier; and the bed-time frolics with baby made Midget grow fat from
10419,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"laughing, if the old adage is true, “Laugh and grow fat.” There had"
10420,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"been so many bright days, in Midget’s opinion, since baby came; that"
10421,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the little girl quite forgot that there were such thing as clouds.
10422,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"And so one day, when she went home, it gave her a dreadful shock to"
10423,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"find poor old granny faint and ill upon the low bed, and two of the"
10424,BY MARY D. BRINE.,neighbors watching beside her.
10425,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10426,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget looked around. Where was her baby? There was granny, so white,"
10427,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and grown so suddenly older than Midget had ever noticed before, but"
10428,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"baby was crying in the arms of a girl-neighbor, who had volunteered to"
10429,BY MARY D. BRINE.,“kape the spalpeen quiet” till Midget’s return.
10430,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10431,BY MARY D. BRINE.,It didn’t take our little mother a minute to secure within her own
10432,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"tender arms the frightened baby, and then Midget sat patiently down"
10433,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"beside granny, who neither stirred nor opened her dim eyes until"
10434,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"midnight. If I had time I could tell you how, after days of watching"
10435,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and sadness, grandma made Midget understand that her sickness could not"
10436,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"be cured on earth. But the end came, after all, too suddenly for little"
10437,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget’s comprehension, and when the kind neighbors had laid the old"
10438,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"woman away, to rest forever from labor, our little heroine had only her"
10439,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"laughing, crowing baby to comfort and cheer her."
10440,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10441,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"She went to live with a kind woman who had known granny for years, and"
10442,BY MARY D. BRINE.,was but little better off in worldly goods than the old grandmother had
10443,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"been. Still, Midget could not starve; and she and her baby were made"
10444,BY MARY D. BRINE.,welcome in the new home. And after that she took the little one with
10445,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"her to the flower-stand, and brought her home at noon herself each day"
10446,BY MARY D. BRINE.,for two weeks.
10447,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10448,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"And then another thing happened, which, for a brief time, almost broke"
10449,BY MARY D. BRINE.,the child’s heart.
10450,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10451,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It was a beautiful day late in the summer, and baby, a big, fat girl,"
10452,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"was crowing and laughing in Midget’s lap, when a gentleman paused to"
10453,BY MARY D. BRINE.,buy flowers. While Midget was giving him change baby reached out her
10454,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"hand to touch the gentleman’s cane, and he looked at the baby face"
10455,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"first with indifference, then more earnestly, and finally with a"
10456,BY MARY D. BRINE.,startled look on his own face which puzzled Midget.
10457,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10458,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Then he questioned her about the child, and asked if it had, under the"
10459,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"soft golden curls, on the back of the neck, a small red mark."
10460,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10461,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget innocently replied: “O, I’ve seen it whenever I’ve dressed my"
10462,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"baby; why, sir?”"
10463,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10464,BY MARY D. BRINE.,Poor little Midget! Little she knew that with her own lips she was
10465,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"giving away her baby, for the gentleman, raising the curls that fell"
10466,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"about the fat little neck, saw himself the mark which gave him back his"
10467,BY MARY D. BRINE.,own lost child.
10468,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10469,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"It would be too long a story to relate how, just as he and his wife,"
10470,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"so long ago, were going on board a European steamer, followed by nurse"
10471,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"and baby, the nurse, carrying out a well-laid plot, slipped behind and"
10472,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"sold for a large sum (promised) her little charge to an accomplice, who"
10473,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"hoped to claim the reward which he thought would be offered, when, too"
10474,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"late, the child’s loss was discovered; and, from that day until now,"
10475,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"both parents had mourned for their baby. The nurse, failing to receive"
10476,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"her promised share of money, worried and frightened the accomplice"
10477,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"until he deserted the baby, and when the nurse would have sought it,"
10478,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"Midget had taken her treasure home. The reward was offered, but, as it"
10479,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"happened, granny had not seen it, and thus the child of aristocratic"
10480,BY MARY D. BRINE.,birth became indebted for life to Midget’s care.
10481,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10482,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"All this the gentleman explained afterwards to Midget, after he had"
10483,BY MARY D. BRINE.,bidden her return to the florist her flowers and come with him. And
10484,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"then, in the presence of baby May’s mother Midget told her story, with"
10485,BY MARY D. BRINE.,many sobs and tears.
10486,BY MARY D. BRINE.,
10487,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"But the sunshine was coming to our heroine again,--the clouds were only"

10489,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"the services of faithful Midget, as nurse for the baby she loved, and"
10490,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"took both baby and Midget away to the beautiful country-house, where"
10491,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"were birds and flowers and hanging leaves and grasses, which made the"
10492,BY MARY D. BRINE.,"fall so cheery a season as it never had been for Midget before--why,"

10495,BY MARY D. BRINE.,dismal streets and old cellars and she a poor little flower-merchant

10511,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"There was one pet, secret fault which was the delight of Tot Sheldon’s"
10512,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"heart, and that was the eating, at night, after going to bed of such"
10513,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,goodies as she could previously lay her mischievous little hands on.
10514,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10515,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,Anything whatever to eat between the five o’clock P. M. supper and
10516,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,the seven o’clock A. M. breakfast was a forbidden luxury to the
10517,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Sheldon children, for their good parents considered it altogether an"
10518,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,unwholesome habit for little ones to give their stomachs work for
10519,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the night. It was only adults, in their opinion, who might indulge"
10520,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"themselves in rosy-cheeked apples, tempting nuts, or other dainties,"
10521,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"in the long winter evenings, with impunity. To be sure, these little"
10522,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"treats, seeming doubly delicious to the watering mouths of the children"
10523,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"because forbidden them, were only brought forth after the clock had"
10524,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"struck eight--the bed-hour of the youthful Sheldons, but, by some"
10525,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"mysterious instinct which children often possess, they knew well enough"
10526,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the night custom of their elders, and were ambitious to grow up, that"
10527,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"they, too, might not go to bed hungry."
10528,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10529,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"For it was not seldom the case that they were, notwithstanding their"
10530,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"hearty suppers of bread and milk, and such other food as was supposed"
10531,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"to be harmless to the youthful digestion, really hungry before they"
10532,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,fell to sleep.
10533,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10534,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Little Tot, however, had a special antipathy to hunger, either real or"
10535,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"imaginary, and a similar love, as has been said, for secret nocturnal"
10536,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"feasts. The other children being boys, Tot had a cunning little"
10537,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"bed-room all to herself, and so could indulge her eccentric appetite"
10538,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"without much fear of disturbance. To be sure, she often felt certain"
10539,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"guilty qualms of conscience, when her mother would look into her room"
10540,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"to kiss her good-night, and she feigned sleep, while clutching tightly"
10541,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,her prize beneath her pillow. Crumbs of gingerbread or cracker would
10542,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"have betrayed her the next day, but Tot had been brought up to take"
10543,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,care of her own mite of a room.
10544,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10545,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,She wasn’t afraid of nightmares. Not Tot! She had eaten too many
10546,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"stolen suppers, and passed through the ordeal unharmed, to be afraid"
10547,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"of any such bugbears, as she termed them. Neither of illness, for"
10548,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,she considered her little stomach to be quite equal to that of any

10553,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,way to Tot’s chamber. But one night it was a whole pint of roasted
10554,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,chestnuts which her uncle Harry had given her as he met her coming from
10555,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"school, and which she had hoarded away, beneath the snowy sheets of her"

10557,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10558,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"For once Tot Sheldon was not unwilling to go to bed, a most remarkable"
10559,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"occurrence. She said her good-nights with such cheerfulness, and"
10560,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"started off with such alacrity that, unmindful of the many bed-times"
10561,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"when the contrary had been true of her behavior, Mr. Sheldon said"
10562,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"something, in a satisfied tone, about “the good effect of early"

10564,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10565,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Chestnuts were Tot’s special delight,--and _roasted_ chestnuts!"
10566,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10567,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"How she longed to get at them, that she might release the mealy meat,"
10568,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"white and fine almost as flour, from the bursting brown shells, and"
10569,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"revel in the peculiar, delicious flavor which she knew and loved so"
10570,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,well!
10571,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10572,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Having undressed and ensconced herself in her cosey little bed, she"
10573,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,waited with impatience for her mother’s nightly visit. She daren’t eat
10574,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"any of the nuts before, for fear something of the nutty aroma might be"
10575,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,in her breath.
10576,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10577,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But she forgot that roasted chestnuts have a fragrance of their own,"
10578,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"even while yet in their shells, and she trembled with fear least she"
10579,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"should lose her treasures, when her mother, after kissing her, said"
10580,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,kindly:
10581,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10582,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“You haven’t been eating chestnuts, have you, Tot? It seems as though I"
10583,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,smelled them.”
10584,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10585,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“No, marm,” replied naughty, trembling Tot."
10586,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10587,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“That’s right, for you’d be sure to have dreadful nightmares,” said"
10588,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Mrs. Sheldon, as she bade her child good-night, and closed the door,"
10589,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,distrusting the evidence of her own keen sense of smell.
10590,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10591,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Well, anyway,” said Tot to herself, as her mother’s footsteps died"
10592,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"away, “I hadn’t eaten any, so I didn’t tell a lie.”"
10593,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10594,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"She thought the matter over a moment, thinking of the nightmares of"
10595,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"which she had been so often told, and half resolving to be so good a"
10596,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,girl as not to eat any of the nuts; but in the midst of her resolution
10597,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"her hand strayed beneath her pillow, and into a paper-bag, and came out"
10598,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"with a splendid great chestnut, which she had no sooner tasted than she"
10599,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"sat up in bed, and with the bag in her lap began a feast."
10600,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10601,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"The room was not very dark, for the light from the hall burner streamed"
10602,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"through the transom over her door; and, if it had been pitch dark, Tot"
10603,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"had no fear of it, for she had never been frightened with any of the"
10604,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"silly, wicked stories often told to children."
10605,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10606,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,So she crunched away on the delicious nuts until they were about half
10607,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"gone, and then stopped suddenly with a sense of fear lest she had eaten"
10608,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"too many, rolled the bag carefully about the rest, put them under her"
10609,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"pillow, and soon dozed off to sleep."
10610,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10611,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But she didn’t sleep as soundly as usual, and woke up sometime in the"
10612,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"night, when the hall-light had been put out, and it was perfectly dark."
10613,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Her hand was tightly grasping the bag of nuts, and as she didn’t go at"
10614,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"once to sleep, she thought she would try just one more,--which resulted"
10615,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"in her again sitting up in bed, and finishing the pint of roasted"
10616,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,chestnuts in the dark.
10617,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10618,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"[Illustration: “SHE SAT UP IN BED, AND BEGAN A FEAST.”]"
10619,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10620,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"That was a fearful infliction for Tot’s little stomach, strong as it"
10621,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"was naturally, and although she didn’t have any nightmares--that she"
10622,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"could remember, at least--she woke reluctantly in the morning, to a"
10623,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"sense that Bridget was knocking loudly on her door, and telling her"
10624,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"that breakfast was over, and it was very late."
10625,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10626,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"At first she felt obstinate, and declared that she wouldn’t get up,"
10627,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,but would go to sleep again; then a sudden guilty consciousness of the
10628,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,paper-bag full of the husks of a pint of chestnuts came to her mind;
10629,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,and the fear least somebody should come into the room and discover them
10630,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,made her turn hastily out of bed and begin to dress.
10631,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10632,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But, as the old saying goes, she got out “the wrong side of the bed”"
10633,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"that morning, and everything was troublesome. Never had Tot experienced"
10634,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"so much trouble with every article of clothing, with her ablutions,"
10635,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,with her hair; and at last she nearly left the room without her bag of
10636,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"shells, which she had laid on a chair while making the bed, which she"
10637,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"dared not leave unmade, although there was no time, this morning, for"
10638,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,it to air first.
10639,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10640,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But cramming the shells into her pocket, together with her"
10641,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"pocket-handkerchief, Tot started down-stairs, regardless of such faults"
10642,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"in her toilet, as that her petticoat was wrong side out, her dress"
10643,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"buttoned “up garret and down cellar,” her hair parted almost as much"
10644,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"on the side as a boy’s, while her curls, usually so pretty, were mere"
10645,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,stringlets.
10646,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10647,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"When she reached the sitting-room, the clock pointed to quarter before"
10648,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"nine, and as there was no time for her to eat the breakfast which had"
10649,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"been saved for her, she threw on her sack and hat, seized her books,"
10650,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,and started for school.
10651,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10652,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,The rule of the school was that each pupil must be in his or her seat
10653,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"at five minutes before nine, and as Tot was one of the best scholars,"
10654,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"and very ambitious, she was disgusted to find that all kinds of street"
10655,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,obstructions concurred to belate her.
10656,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10657,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,She came within a hair’s breadth of being run over by one desperate
10658,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"driver, and was only rescued by a brave policeman who pulled her from"
10659,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the tangle of horses and teams, but he hurt her arm severely by his"
10660,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"grasp. Indeed, poor Tot afterward found it was black and blue."
10661,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10662,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,Then she fell down in the mud and made a sorry looking spectacle of
10663,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,both herself and her books.
10664,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10665,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"So that when she arrived at school, only to find the doors closed for"
10666,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the morning prayer, she was about as thoroughly cross as could well be"
10667,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,imagined.
10668,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10669,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"A reproof from her teacher, who was vexed that his best pupil should"
10670,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"set such an example of tardiness, exasperated Tot into an ugly"
10671,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,obstinate resolve to say nothing of the accidents by which she was
10672,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"belated. So she took her seat without a word, and looked for her French"
10673,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"grammar, to study the lesson which was soon to be called for."
10674,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10675,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But she couldn’t find it, and then she remembered laying it apart from"
10676,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the other books, the previous evening, and that it was thus left at"
10677,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,home.
10678,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10679,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Too angry still with the teacher, whom she had always before liked, to"
10680,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"tell him of the blunder, Tot turned to her desk-mate and broke another"
10681,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"rule, by asking the loan of the French grammar which the latter was not"
10682,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,using.
10683,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10684,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,But the master’s eye was on her.
10685,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10686,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Miss Sheldon, you were whispering! Take a misdemeanor!”"
10687,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10688,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Tot did not answer, and choked down the rising sobs. A “misdemeanor”"
10689,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"was the blackest of black marks, and never before had she received one."
10690,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10691,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Some of her friends among the pupils looked at her sympathizingly, but"
10692,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"there were those who, always envious of the more studious and obedient"
10693,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"of their number, showed their spiteful delight at her fall."
10694,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10695,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Of course she failed in her French, and lost her high place in the"
10696,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"class, and finally, when a stinging and almost unjust rebuke came from"
10697,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"the teacher, poor Tot could stand it no longer, and bursting into tears"
10698,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"she hastily pulled her handkerchief from her pocket, when, with it, out"
10699,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,flew the forgotten chestnut-shells all over the room!
10700,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10701,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Into the master’s very face and eyes they went, and he, half blinded,"
10702,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"and not fully realizing how it happened, told Tot that she needn’t stay"
10703,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,at school any longer unless she could behave better.
10704,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10705,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Out of temper from the beginning, angered beyond measure at what she"
10706,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"considered injustice, and maddened still more by the shout of laughter"
10707,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"that went up from the school at the episode of the nut-shells, Tot"
10708,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,defiantly replied:
10709,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10710,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Then I’ll go home, and never enter this hateful old place again as"

10712,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10713,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Miss Sheldon, you will repent this. Miss Mayfair will accompany you"

10716,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,to-night.”
10717,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10718,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"With flushed face and quickly beating heart, Tot left the school-room,"
10719,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"put on her things, and started for home."
10720,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10721,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Had not her companion been with her, it is possible that she would have"

10723,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10724,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"It was a little strange that Nettie Mayfair, her own particular friend,"
10725,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"should have been selected as her companion. But so it was, and, as soon"
10726,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"as they were out of the building, Nettie exclaimed in friendly but"
10727,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,annoyed tones:
10728,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10729,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Why, Tot Sheldon, how _could_ you!”"
10730,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10731,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“_I!_” repeated Tot, her anger rising toward the very one to whom she"
10732,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"had meant to pour out all her griefs, “how could _I_? Why, I didn’t do"
10733,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,anything--it was all that mean old Mr. Stimpson! I never saw such an
10734,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,abominable man in my life!”
10735,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10736,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Oh, Tot!” began Nettie indignantly, “you know he has always been as"
10737,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,good as--”
10738,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10739,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“No, he hasn’t either, Net Mayfair--and if you stand up for him, you’re"
10740,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"just as bad as he, a mean hateful girl--_so_!”"
10741,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10742,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“I should think you’d be ashamed of yourself, you spiteful girl,” cried"
10743,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Nettie, “I don’t see how I ever came to like you.”"
10744,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10745,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“And _I_ never did like _you_” retorted Tot, “though I was fool enough"
10746,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,to think I did! I’ll never speak to you again!”
10747,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10748,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Nor I to you, so long as I live!” was Nettie’s reply."
10749,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10750,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Arrived at home at last, the message and accompanying discharge from"
10751,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Mr. Stimpson was read by Mrs. Sheldon, who, full of sorrow and almost"
10752,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"in tears, told her daughter to go to her chamber and remain till her"

10755,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10756,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"The key was turned that made Tot a prisoner in her own little bed-room,"
10757,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,and here she remained through the long hours of the day without hearing
10758,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,a word or a step near her door. No voice came to her longing ears from
10759,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"parent or brother; no food to eat, and no books to read,--nothing to do"
10760,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,but to think.
10761,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10762,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,What a condition was she in indeed! Discharged in disgrace from the
10763,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,school she loved; under the lasting ban of the displeasure of the
10764,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,master she had always so much respected; the friendship with her own
10765,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Nettie utterly broken; and a prisoner in her room, utterly uncertain"

10767,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10768,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"The twilight darkened, and night came on. The hall gas was not lit, and"

10770,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10771,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"At last, fearing and trembling, poor little Tot undressed and crept"

10774,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10775,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"But at last she slept so soundly, that she was only awakened by her"

10778,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10779,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Why, Tot, my darling, what is the matter? Why are you so flushed and"

10785,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10786,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Bless the child! I don’t wonder you were restless! Why, you’ve been"

10790,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"The laugh had left her mother’s voice, and it was sad but yet tender,"
10791,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,when Tot exclaimed in surprise:
10792,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10793,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Last night! wasn’t it night before last? What day is this, mamma?”"
10794,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10795,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Tuesday, of course,--what do you mean?”"
10796,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10797,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“I thought it was Wednesday, and oh! such dreadful things happened"
10798,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"yesterday!” and Tot threw herself on her mother’s bosom, and burst into"
10799,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,sobs.
10800,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10801,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Oh--I see, my dear,” said Mrs. Sheldon, tenderly stroking her child’s"
10802,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"tumbled curls, “_you’ve had your nightmare!_ But don’t cry, for nothing"
10803,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"really dreadful has happened, except that I’m afraid my little girl"
10804,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,told her mother a wrong story last night.”
10805,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10806,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"“Oh, no, I didn’t, mamma--or, at least I thought I didn’t; for I hadn’t"
10807,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"eaten a single nut when you asked me, but ate them afterwards;--but,"
10808,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"oh! I’ll never do it again in the world, if you’ll forgive me.”"
10809,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10810,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"The forgiveness was freely granted, when the story of a day’s troubles"
10811,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"which had been crowded into an hour’s disturbed slumber, had been"
10812,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"related, and Tot in the neatest of toilets and with the freshest curls,"
10813,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"ate her breakfast, and, without forgetting to take her French grammar,"
10814,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,went off to school. She could hardly get it out of her head all day
10815,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"long, that she was in disgrace, but her lessons went off well, Mr."
10816,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Stimpson was as kind as ever, and Nettie Mayfair was as loving as a"
10817,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,bosom-friend could possibly be.
10818,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10819,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,Tot’s strong digestive organs had done the heavy work assigned them by
10820,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"their reckless little mistress, but they had given her a foretaste of"
10821,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"what might happen in reality, were she to grow dyspeptic and miserable,"
10822,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"through abusing them. In her unrest, she had turned over her pillow to"
10823,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"find a cool spot for her head, and spilt the shells from their bag into"
10824,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,the bed.
10825,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,
10826,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"One good lesson was taught by the nightmare, however, to the mother as"
10827,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"well as the child, for thereafter, some light refreshment, as a slice"
10828,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"of light plain cake and a glass of milk, was allowed each child of the"
10829,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,"Sheldon family, an hour before he or she went to bed, and thus the"
10830,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,temptation to recur to her old habit never overcame Tot’s resolution to
10831,BY LILY J. CHUTE.,eat no more private lunches.

10842,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10843,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"First, there was Tom Doddles; and he was a bother. Grandma said so,"
10844,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"when she found him snugly curled up in her favorite arm-chair, grandpa"
10845,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"stumbled over him in the doorway, and sister Caroline declared that"
10846,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,“the little plague _shouldn’t_ go with her when she went to take her
10847,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"music lessons.” Don’t imagine that Tom Doddles cared for music; O, not"
10848,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"at all; he plainly said so when he heard any, by a series of howls, and"
10849,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"little, jerky barks."
10850,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10851,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"But he liked to drive out in the phaeton, and stand up with his"
10852,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"fore-paws on the dash-board, and look at the horse, with the most"
10853,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,solemn air imaginable.
10854,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10855,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"That is, he would do so for a short distance, until thinking,"
10856,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"doubtless, that the wise traveler should improve all opportunities, he"
10857,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,would dash down and away for a nearer inspection of bird or butterfly.
10858,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"And once he had too much curiosity about a bee; after that, he thought"
10859,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"bees were rather disagreeable, and quite ignored their society."
10860,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10861,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"And you see, scrambling through sand-heaps, and splashing through"
10862,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"mud-puddles, was apt to disarrange his toilet. And he didn’t care in"
10863,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"the least, but would jump back again in a social manner, that was very"
10864,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,distressing to Caroline.
10865,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10866,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,She did not like to have her clean frocks “mussed” and disfigured by
10867,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"mud, and ever so many little black and white hairs."
10868,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10869,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"But what could she do? What would you do, if you lived in the country,"
10870,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,and your little sister had a little pet dog that wanted to go to town
10871,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,whenever you did? Would you let him go? And if he stood up on his hind
10872,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"legs, as straight as a soldier, and begged, “jess as hard,” as his"
10873,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"little mistress said, while she kissed and coaxed for him, could you"
10874,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,refuse?
10875,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10876,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"Caroline could not, for a long time; but one day she drove off, leaving"
10877,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"Lulu and Tom Doddles wailing together, while she flourished the whip to"
10878,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,keep him at a distance.
10879,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10880,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"His non-attendance was such a relief and comfort generally, that she"
10881,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,decided to leave him at home in future; and for several weeks poor
10882,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,Tommy supplicated in vain.
10883,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10884,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"At last, when the phaeton and little gray pony came around to the door,"
10885,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,Tom was invisible.
10886,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10887,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,Cad laughed as she took the reins.
10888,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10889,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"“Why, Tom has given it up,” she said, “poor little fellow! How he"
10890,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"did enjoy going; but he was a nuisance, and I’m glad if he’s learned"
10891,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,better.”
10892,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10893,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"“Come, Fannie,” to the friend who was going with her, and away they"
10894,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"went, as gayly as if there were no little dogs breaking their hearts at"
10895,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,home.
10896,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10897,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"However, that day, _the_ little dog was otherwise engaged. You’ll"
10898,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"laugh to hear that when they were about two miles from home, the merry"
10899,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,"chatter of the girls was broken by a tiny, smothered bow-wow, very much"
10900,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,like a suppressed sneeze in church.
10901,BY MARY STANDISH ROBINSON.,
10902,“O!”,“O!”
10903,“O!”,
10904,“O!”,“What is that?” chorused the girls.
10905,“O!”,
10906,“O!”,"Then Cad jumped, and almost let the gray pony have his own way."
10907,“O!”,
10908,“O!”,For something under the seat was tickling her; and before she could
10909,“O!”,"look for the cause, out popped the head of Thomas Doddles, Esq., who"
10910,“O!”,"proceeded to look serenely about him, as if conscious of a success that"
10911,“O!”,no one could dispute.
10912,“O!”,
10913,“O!”,"“The cunning darling!” said Fannie, laughing so that she could not sit"
10914,“O!”,up straight.
10915,“O!”,
10916,“O!”,“O you scamp!” cried Cad. “I’d throw him away if ’twere not for Luly.”
10917,“O!”,
10918,“O!”,"“Now sir!” said she, addressing him with great severity, “_don’t you"
10919,“O!”,dare_ to jump out of this carriage to-day.”
10920,“O!”,
10921,“O!”,But you’ll not be surprised to learn that he did so the very next
10922,“O!”,"moment. How could he help it, when a chipmunk chattered a challenge for"
10923,“O!”,a race to the nearest tree?
10924,“O!”,
10925,“O!”,"Tom lost, and nearly dislocated his neck by looking up so much, and"
10926,“O!”,barking at the same time.
10927,“O!”,
10928,“O!”,"As for the chipmunk, not a walnut cared he; and what he chippered back"
10929,“O!”,might mean:
10930,“O!”,
10931,“O!”,"“You’re smart, Mr. Dog, but, smart as you are you can’t catch me!”"
10932,“O!”,
10933,“O!”,"Well, Tom Doddles was a bother! But he was a cunning one, and between"
10934,“O!”,the scoldings and the pettings that he received he was as spoiled as a
10935,“O!”,doggie could be.
10936,“O!”,
10937,“O!”,But we all felt bad when a careless man shot him by mistake.
10938,“O!”,
10939,“O!”,"And Lulu mourned so much that Aunt Sarah, after talking with mamma and"
10940,“O!”,"grandma, went away one afternoon, and returned at night with a large"
10941,“O!”,"box, about which she was as mysterious as a fairy godmother."
10942,“O!”,
10943,“O!”,Lulu knew from experience that Aunt Sarah’s mysteries always meant
10944,“O!”,something delightful; and after a little teasing about what _was_ in
10945,“O!”,"the big wooden box, she put two kisses on auntie’s cheek, and said she"
10946,“O!”,"would go to bed, and “find it all out in a dream.”"
10947,“O!”,
10948,“O!”,"But she didn’t, after all. She was awakened the next morning by a smart"
10949,“O!”,"little tap that was _not_ a kiss, on her own round, pinkie-pearly cheek."
10950,“O!”,
10951,“O!”,And there was such a queer little munchy noise going on!
10952,“O!”,
10953,“O!”,"The blue eyes opened; languidly at first, but they were wide and bright"
10954,“O!”,"in an instant, for there was something curious for them to see. First,"
10955,“O!”,"a heap of walnuts lying on her bed. Where did _they_ come from? Then,"
10956,“O!”,"sitting up in the midst of them, and working away like a complete"
10957,“O!”,"little nut-cracker, was the most charming gray squirrel that anybody"
10958,“O!”,ever saw.
10959,“O!”,
10960,“O!”,"“O!” exclaimed Lulu. “Why!! Where _did_ you come from, Beauty?”"
10961,“O!”,
10962,“O!”,"For all answer, Gray-Coat tossed her an empty walnut-shell, and cracked"
10963,“O!”,"an uncommonly large one on the spot, just to show her how well he could"
10964,“O!”,do it.
10965,“O!”,
10966,“O!”,Lulu picked up a piece of shell from the pillow. “That’s what struck me
10967,“O!”,"on the cheek,” she said, jumping up. “I know now! he was in Aunt Saty’s"
10968,“O!”,"box, and I guess he’s all mine. Where’s auntie? Where _is_ mamma?"
10969,“O!”,
10970,“O!”,"“O! O! O! What is this here? A little silver house, true’s I live.”"
10971,“O!”,
10972,“O!”,"By this time the little girl was dancing around the room, as if she"
10973,“O!”,"were practising for a ballet performance. Grandma, mamma and Aunt Sarah"
10974,“O!”,"appeared in the door-way, and grandpa peeped in, too."
10975,“O!”,
10976,“O!”,“What’s going on here?” asked he.
10977,“O!”,
10978,“O!”,"“O, I never!” said Lulu, hugging first one and then the other. “I know"
10979,“O!”,"all ’bout it, auntie. _You_ did it, an’ I think he’s lovely, an’ what’s"
10980,“O!”,"his name, an’ he’s mine for always, ain’t he?”"
10981,“O!”,
10982,“O!”,"“His name is Dick,” said auntie."
10983,“O!”,
10984,“O!”,"“Dickon Gray,” suggested mamma, “and I hope that Pussy will not eat"
10985,“O!”,him.”
10986,“O!”,
10987,“O!”,"“We must watch him,” said grandma."
10988,“O!”,
10989,“O!”,"And they did, very carefully at first. But surely, that squirrel and"
10990,“O!”,cat were predestined friends; for they would frolic and play together
10991,“O!”,like two kittens.
10992,“O!”,
10993,“O!”,And when puss was in extra good humor she would treat Dickon to a ride
10994,“O!”,on her back.
10995,“O!”,
10996,“O!”,"“Arrah,” said Robert, the hired man, “an’ did ye iver say the loike o’"
10997,“O!”,"that, now? It bates the li-in an’ the lamb, I’m thinkin’.”"
10998,“O!”,
10999,“O!”,"Yes, and puss evidently had much respect for Dick’s judgment; because,"
11000,“O!”,upon her return from market she often brought a tender mouse-steak for
11001,“O!”,his inspection.
11002,“O!”,
11003,“O!”,I suppose you would like to know if Dickon lived in his little house?
11004,“O!”,"It was of tin, and so new and bright that it did look like silver. He"
11005,“O!”,"had a nice bed made of cotton wool, in the upper story. But did he"
11006,“O!”,sleep in it? Well--sometimes. One morning he was not there; and after
11007,“O!”,much vain searching Lulu was sure that he was dead--had run away--been
11008,“O!”,stolen--the cat had eaten him.
11009,“O!”,
11010,“O!”,"And she was dolefully sobbing for each separate fate, when Robert"
11011,“O!”,"opened the kitchen door and said, “Ah, come ’ere now, Miss Luly! an’"
11012,“O!”,ye’ll laugh a laugh as big as Tim Toole’s.”
11013,“O!”,
11014,“O!”,"Robert was a favorite with Lulu, and she followed him up-stairs into"
11015,“O!”,"the grain-chamber, sobbing and sighing as she went."
11016,“O!”,
11017,“O!”,"He swung her up in his strong arms, over the great oat-bin, with, “An’"
11018,“O!”,"only say there, now, Miss Luly!”"
11019,“O!”,
11020,“O!”,"And then, how she _did_ laugh! for there was the darling, eating his"
11021,“O!”,"way out of the oats, as if his very life depended upon it."
11022,“O!”,
11023,“O!”,"Didn’t she hug him, though! He was so tame that she could handle and"
11024,“O!”,fondle him without fear of being bitten; but this time her joy made her
11025,“O!”,"squeeze him _so_ close that he suddenly darted up, and sliced a tiny"
11026,“O!”,bit of skin from the tip of her saucy little nose.
11027,“O!”,
11028,“O!”,"“Euh!” cried Lulu, “mamma! Dick’s bit my nose! I ’fraid he’s all"
11029,“O!”,spoiled it! What _shall_ I do?”
11030,“O!”,
11031,“O!”,"Mamma was frightened, I assure you, and ran to examine her little girl."
11032,“O!”,
11033,“O!”,Dick repented the moment he did this naughty thing; and tucked his head
11034,“O!”,under Lulu’s arm while he trembled violently.
11035,“O!”,
11036,“O!”,"“It’s nothing serious, but he must be whipped,” said mamma."
11037,“O!”,
11038,“O!”,"“O no! please don’t whip him,” said Lulu. “His little heart beats so"
11039,“O!”,fas’ now I’m ’fraid ’twill break.”
11040,“O!”,
11041,“O!”,"“’Twas only a love-pat,” said grandpa, “I guess he didn’t mean to.”"
11042,“O!”,
11043,“O!”,"“He’ll bite harder next time if he is not properly punished,” said"
11044,“O!”,"mamma, firmly, and she shut him in his cage, and gave him three or four"
11045,“O!”,strokes with a small switch. Then he was left alone in disgrace.
11046,“O!”,
11047,“O!”,"But it was not long before Lulu stole in, and gave him a lump of sugar"
11048,“O!”,that she had coaxed from grandma.
11049,“O!”,
11050,“O!”,"“Don’t you mind it, Dicky,” said she, kissing him through the"
11051,“O!”,"prison-bars. “I love you just as much’s ever, and to-morrow you shall"
11052,“O!”,come out again.”
11053,“O!”,
11054,“O!”,"Dick nibbled part of the sugar, and slyly tucked away the rest in a"
11055,“O!”,corner. I dare say he was thinking of next winter; just as housekeepers
11056,“O!”,are when they put up the sweetmeats that we all like so well.
11057,“O!”,
11058,“O!”,"Then he remembered that he had a carriage at command, and bowled away"
11059,“O!”,"in his wheel at a rapid pace; only he never arrived anywhere, you know,"
11060,“O!”,and that must have puzzled him sorely.
11061,“O!”,
11062,“O!”,"So Lulu went on loving him more and more every day, until Tom Doddles"
11063,“O!”,was almost forgotten.
11064,“O!”,
11065,“O!”,"Dolls were neglected, and sometimes abused; for was not Miss Patty"
11066,“O!”,"Primrose (who only a year ago had been “the beautifulest darling”),"
11067,“O!”,"found lying on the hard, cold floor, with her clothing in wild disorder?"
11068,“O!”,
11069,“O!”,Lulu well knew that Miss Patty had been snugly tucked up in a
11070,“O!”,"cradle-bed, and put by on a high shelf. How came she down there in this"
11071,“O!”,plight?
11072,“O!”,
11073,“O!”,"Lulu looked up at the cradle, and saw a pair of very bright, sprite-y"
11074,“O!”,"eyes peering out of it. Behold! Master Dick had turned out poor dolly,"
11075,“O!”,"and was lying flat on his stomach in the little bed, using his own"
11076,“O!”,silver-gray tail for a blanket.
11077,“O!”,
11078,“O!”,It grieves me; but as a faithful historian I must relate that a sad day
11079,“O!”,"finally came, when dear Dickon was missing; and alas! this time, he"
11080,“O!”,could not be found.
11081,“O!”,
11082,“O!”,There was no clue to his fate.
11083,“O!”,
11084,“O!”,Perhaps the voices of the woods had called him back to his early home.
11085,“O!”,Perhaps he had been enticed away.
11086,“O!”,
11087,“O!”,"No one knew, but in a few days they realized that he had gone “for"
11088,“O!”,"always,” as Lulu said, and they spoke of getting another one for her."
11089,“O!”,
11090,“O!”,But she did not want it.
11091,“O!”,
11092,“O!”,"“I would rather ’member my own p’ecious Dicky,” she said, “than to have"
11093,“O!”,"fifty ‘other ones,’ They could never be the same, and would only make"
11094,“O!”,me think that p’r’aps he was mis’able somewhere while they was havin’ a
11095,“O!”,good time.”

11141,BY L. J. L.,"whispered, as she was about to leave the room, that it would be well"
11142,BY L. J. L.,"to put the empty stocking out of sight, and thus hide from others the"
11143,BY L. J. L.,evidence of her disappointment.
11144,BY L. J. L.,
11145,BY L. J. L.,But the moment she laid her hand upon it for this purpose she
11146,BY L. J. L.,discovered that she had been laboring under a great mistake. It was
11147,BY L. J. L.,not empty. Concealed in a fold of the upper part was a sealed envelope
11148,BY L. J. L.,"directed to Miss Janet Dunstan, and beside it a neat package wrapped in"
11149,BY L. J. L.,"tissue-paper which, when unrolled, she found to contain five ten-dollar"
11150,BY L. J. L.,bills!
11151,BY L. J. L.,
11152,BY L. J. L.,What could it mean? Could so much money be really hers?
11153,BY L. J. L.,
11154,BY L. J. L.,For a little while Janet was too much bewildered to think of the note
11155,BY L. J. L.,"in her hand as a probable explanation, but presently she caught sight"
11156,BY L. J. L.,"of it, and with a little laugh at her own stupidity she opened it and"
11157,BY L. J. L.,"found in Grandpa’s hand-writing the quaintest, queerest epistle it had"
11158,BY L. J. L.,ever been hers to receive.
11159,BY L. J. L.,
11160,BY L. J. L.,"It began with “Respected Granddaughter,” and then with a profusion of"
11161,BY L. J. L.,"big words and complimentary phrases, went on to relate how a number"
11162,BY L. J. L.,"of her worshipful friends, consisting of father, mother, uncle Tim,"
11163,BY L. J. L.,grandma and himself had gathered themselves together at an appointed
11164,BY L. J. L.,place to deliberate upon the matter of Christmas gifts; and being thus
11165,BY L. J. L.,in “solemn conclave assembled” that which should be done for her had
11166,BY L. J. L.,"received due attention, and it had been the unanimous decision in view"
11167,BY L. J. L.,"of the fact of her having attained the dignity of fifteen years, that"
11168,BY L. J. L.,it was time to cease filling her stockings with toys and confections;
11169,BY L. J. L.,"and, as it proved somewhat difficult to decide what other offerings"
11170,BY L. J. L.,"might be most acceptable, they had finally come to the conclusion to"
11171,BY L. J. L.,"act upon a suggestion made by uncle Tim, which was to give nothing but"
11172,BY L. J. L.,"money, with which she could procure such things as would best suit"
11173,BY L. J. L.,"her taste: therefore, in the accompanying package she would please"
11174,BY L. J. L.,find fifty dollars--ten dollars from each; and hoping this would prove
11175,BY L. J. L.,"entirely satisfactory, he had the honor to subscribe himself her humble"
11176,BY L. J. L.,"servant, etc., etc., etc."
11177,BY L. J. L.,
11178,BY L. J. L.,Janet laughed. Knowing well grandpa’s propensity for joking she saw the
11179,BY L. J. L.,sly fun with which all these stilted phrases had been indited; but when
11180,BY L. J. L.,"she again looked upon the money in her hand, her eyes filled with tears"
11181,BY L. J. L.,"at the thought of the confidence in her, on the part of her relatives,"
11182,BY L. J. L.,which so generous a gift signified.
11183,BY L. J. L.,
11184,BY L. J. L.,"For none of them were wealthy, although in fairly comfortable"
11185,BY L. J. L.,"circumstances, and she knew so large an amount of money would never"
11186,BY L. J. L.,have been placed at her disposal had they not been tolerably sure that
11187,BY L. J. L.,"it would not be foolishly expended. And, then and there, she resolved"
11188,BY L. J. L.,they should see that their confidence had not been misplaced. Not one
11189,BY L. J. L.,dollar would she use until there had been discovered some good purpose
11190,BY L. J. L.,to which the whole could be devoted.
11191,BY L. J. L.,
11192,BY L. J. L.,But the discovering of such a purpose proved more difficult than
11193,BY L. J. L.,"was anticipated; partly, because she knew without being told, that"
11194,BY L. J. L.,it was not expected the money would be used for clothing or for any
11195,BY L. J. L.,of those necessary things such as her parents had been in the habit
11196,BY L. J. L.,of providing; and she labored under a great disinclination to ask
11197,BY L. J. L.,"advice in the matter, having an instinctive feeling that the money was"
11198,BY L. J. L.,"given her as a sort of test, which stimulated her to be equal to the"
11199,BY L. J. L.,emergency alone.
11200,BY L. J. L.,
11201,BY L. J. L.,"A week elapsed, and the opening day of the winter term of school"
11202,BY L. J. L.,arrived with the question no nearer a settlement than on Christmas
11203,BY L. J. L.,"morning, except that she had come to the determination to find, if"
11204,BY L. J. L.,"possible, some method of investing her money, by which, while serving"
11205,BY L. J. L.,"some useful purpose to others as well as herself, it should be made to"
11206,BY L. J. L.,yield something of interest in return.
11207,BY L. J. L.,
11208,BY L. J. L.,This denoted both a benevolent and practical turn of mind; and as if
11209,BY L. J. L.,"only waiting such a conclusion, a plan whereby this possibly might all"
11210,BY L. J. L.,be accomplished was that day suggested to her in a remark made by one
11211,BY L. J. L.,of her school-mates which she chanced to overhear.
11212,BY L. J. L.,
11213,BY L. J. L.,"“Oh, how I wish,” said one little girl to another, “some one here would"
11214,BY L. J. L.,keep books to lend as they do in cities. My auntie writes she has the
11215,BY L. J. L.,reading of all the books she desires by simply paying two cents a day
11216,BY L. J. L.,for their use.”
11217,BY L. J. L.,
11218,BY L. J. L.,"Janet started as the thought flashed across her mind that, perhaps,"
11219,BY L. J. L.,here was something she could do; and she wondered how many books
11220,BY L. J. L.,"fifty dollars would buy, and if she would be capable of managing a"
11221,BY L. J. L.,circulating library of this kind.
11222,BY L. J. L.,
11223,BY L. J. L.,The more she thought about it the more pleasing seemed the idea; and
11224,BY L. J. L.,"when Saturday came, bringing a respite from school duties, as was her"
11225,BY L. J. L.,"wont with all matters of importance, she went to talk it over with"
11226,BY L. J. L.,grandpa and get his opinion.
11227,BY L. J. L.,
11228,BY L. J. L.,"Without preamble or delay, waiting only to exchange greetings, she"
11229,BY L. J. L.,plunged directly into her subject by saying:
11230,BY L. J. L.,
11231,BY L. J. L.,"“Grandpa, I have decided that I would like to open a circulating"
11232,BY L. J. L.,library with my money. Do you think I have enough?”
11233,BY L. J. L.,
11234,BY L. J. L.,"Evidently grandpa was not a little surprised, as well as amused, for he"
11235,BY L. J. L.,seemed for a moment to be struggling between a desire to both whistle
11236,BY L. J. L.,"and laugh, although he actually did neither; but, giving Janet a"
11237,BY L. J. L.,quizzical look over his spectacles he said:
11238,BY L. J. L.,
11239,BY L. J. L.,"“Oho! and so you propose to devote your means to charitable purposes,"
11240,BY L. J. L.,do you?”
11241,BY L. J. L.,
11242,BY L. J. L.,"“No, I don’t mean to do anything of the kind,” answered Janet; “I"
11243,BY L. J. L.,propose to have pay for lending my books.”
11244,BY L. J. L.,
11245,BY L. J. L.,Then grandpa did laugh and whistle too. But Janet did not allow herself
11246,BY L. J. L.,"to be disturbed, well knowing that she was sure of his sympathy and"
11247,BY L. J. L.,"attention when he should have his laugh out; and directly, as she"
11248,BY L. J. L.,"expected, he became quite grave, and asked her what had put such an"
11249,BY L. J. L.,idea into her head.
11250,BY L. J. L.,
11251,BY L. J. L.,"Then, as she was confident he would, he listened most kindly while she"
11252,BY L. J. L.,told him all that had been in her mind from the moment of receiving her
11253,BY L. J. L.,"gift, and of how the little girl’s remark had seemed to indicate a way"
11254,BY L. J. L.,"by which she could do not only that which she so much desired, but also"
11255,BY L. J. L.,to gratify a wish she had herself often felt--a wish for more fresh
11256,BY L. J. L.,reading matter than it had been at all times convenient to procure. For
11257,BY L. J. L.,"she thought, could she purchase a small number of volumes and lend them"
11258,BY L. J. L.,"in the manner suggested, that perhaps these might yield a sufficient"
11259,BY L. J. L.,return to enable her to get such others as might from time to time be
11260,BY L. J. L.,desired.
11261,BY L. J. L.,
11262,BY L. J. L.,A look of pleased interest gradually stole over grandpa’s face as Janet
11263,BY L. J. L.,"told her plan, and when she had finished he took his spectacles in his"
11264,BY L. J. L.,"hand, and while balancing them on his forefinger, remarked:"
11265,BY L. J. L.,
11266,BY L. J. L.,"“Why, Janet, you bid fair to become a capital business woman! This is"
11267,BY L. J. L.,not a bad project for a fifteen-year-old head!”
11268,BY L. J. L.,
11269,BY L. J. L.,"“But what do you think, grandpa?--can I make it work?” queried Janet"
11270,BY L. J. L.,"impatiently, too intent upon her purpose to care for compliments."
11271,BY L. J. L.,
11272,BY L. J. L.,Grandpa deliberated a few moments and then replied:
11273,BY L. J. L.,
11274,BY L. J. L.,"“Yes, Janet, I believe your idea is a practicable one, providing you"
11275,BY L. J. L.,are willing to begin in a small way.”
11276,BY L. J. L.,
11277,BY L. J. L.,[Illustration: GRANDPA HIGHLY APPROVES OF JANET.]
11278,BY L. J. L.,
11279,BY L. J. L.,"This Janet expected, as a matter of course, for she well knew fifty"
11280,BY L. J. L.,dollars could not be made to buy a great number of books; but
11281,BY L. J. L.,"thinking there might be more in grandpa’s remark than appeared, she"
11282,BY L. J. L.,asked him to explain.
11283,BY L. J. L.,
11284,BY L. J. L.,"“Why,” said he, “inasmuch as your means will not admit of many books,"
11285,BY L. J. L.,it seems to me that it would be advisable to restrict the variety to
11286,BY L. J. L.,"only such as may be suited to a single class of readers; for instance,"
11287,BY L. J. L.,to young people like yourself.”
11288,BY L. J. L.,
11289,BY L. J. L.,Janet’s eyes sparkled as she clapped her hands and said:
11290,BY L. J. L.,
11291,BY L. J. L.,“I like that. So it shall be; and we will call it the Boys’ and Girls’
11292,BY L. J. L.,Library.”
11293,BY L. J. L.,
11294,BY L. J. L.,"The project approved and a name chosen, what further remained to be"
11295,BY L. J. L.,"done seemed comparatively easy. At least so Janet thought; for grandpa,"
11296,BY L. J. L.,"thoroughly pleased with the idea, very cheerfully offered to assume"
11297,BY L. J. L.,"the entire care of bringing the library into working order, after which"
11298,BY L. J. L.,it was understood the whole management would rest upon Janet.
11299,BY L. J. L.,
11300,BY L. J. L.,It would occupy too much space to enter into all the details of how
11301,BY L. J. L.,this was finally brought about--of the letters written to distant
11302,BY L. J. L.,booksellers and the answers received; of the catalogues he and Janet
11303,BY L. J. L.,looked over together and their discussions in regard to the merits of
11304,BY L. J. L.,different authors--therefore we will omit all this and come at once
11305,BY L. J. L.,to the completed work as it stood when ready to hand over to Janet’s
11306,BY L. J. L.,charge.
11307,BY L. J. L.,
11308,BY L. J. L.,At first father and mother had been somewhat doubtful of her scheme;
11309,BY L. J. L.,but upon learning that it met with grandpa’s approval they concluded
11310,BY L. J. L.,to allow it a fair trial. They saw that to insure the harmonious
11311,BY L. J. L.,"working of the library, there were two important things to be secured"
11312,BY L. J. L.,"at the outset: That patrons should have perfect freedom to come and go,"
11313,BY L. J. L.,and still not be allowed to intrude upon the quiet or privacy of the
11314,BY L. J. L.,household; and with this end in view they caused a tiny room at the end
11315,BY L. J. L.,"of the hall, which had an outside door of its own, to be fitted up and"
11316,BY L. J. L.,set apart for the exclusive use of the library.
11317,BY L. J. L.,
11318,BY L. J. L.,"Across one side of the room was placed a row of low shelves where,"
11319,BY L. J. L.,"after being carefully numbered, the books were neatly arranged, but"
11320,BY L. J. L.,"leaving when all was done considerable unoccupied space which, grandpa"
11321,BY L. J. L.,"said, was for growth should the venture prove a success."
11322,BY L. J. L.,
11323,BY L. J. L.,"Before the window stood a small table holding pens, ink, and"
11324,BY L. J. L.,"record-book, with which, and two chairs, the furniture of the room was"
11325,BY L. J. L.,complete.
11326,BY L. J. L.,
11327,BY L. J. L.,"The main feature of the room, of course, was the books; and,"
11328,BY L. J. L.,considering that these had all come before the public long after
11329,BY L. J. L.,"grandpa had ceased to be personally interested in youthful literature,"
11330,BY L. J. L.,it seemed almost a mystery how he had been able to make his selections
11331,BY L. J. L.,with such admirable taste and judgment. But this was soon accounted for
11332,BY L. J. L.,by the fact that he had been governed in his choice by the standing of
11333,BY L. J. L.,publishing houses and the approval of critics of established taste and
11334,BY L. J. L.,ability. Only such as were thus vouched for were allowed a place in
11335,BY L. J. L.,the collection. When all were shelved there were thirty-five volumes
11336,BY L. J. L.,"in strong cloth covers, including stories for both boys and girls,"
11337,BY L. J. L.,"biographies, travels, etc., and one which would be classed under no"
11338,BY L. J. L.,"general head, bearing the funny title “Behaving.”"
11339,BY L. J. L.,
11340,BY L. J. L.,"These cost on an average $1.20 each, and were all the works of standard"
11341,BY L. J. L.,"authors, such as Mrs. Whitney, Miss Muloch, Miss Alcott, Miss Yonge,"
11342,BY L. J. L.,"Miss Jewett, T. B. Aldrich, J. T. Trowbridge, with others of equal"
11343,BY L. J. L.,"merit. One novel feature of this library must not be omitted, which was"
11344,BY L. J. L.,"a tiny microscope intended to accompany a book entitled, “Evenings with"
11345,BY L. J. L.,"the Microscope,” indicating that grandpa meant this library to be a"
11346,BY L. J. L.,means of profit as well as pleasure to the young people of the village.
11347,BY L. J. L.,
11348,BY L. J. L.,"The cost of the books and microscope amounted to forty-four dollars,"
11349,BY L. J. L.,"leaving six dollars, which were invested in a subscription to two"
11350,BY L. J. L.,"monthly magazines, one a four-dollar monthly, suited to mature minds,"
11351,BY L. J. L.,"and one copy of WIDE AWAKE, which took the remaining two. The magazines"
11352,BY L. J. L.,"were Janet’s own suggestions, in order that every young person should"
11353,BY L. J. L.,be sure to find in the library something to please the individual taste.
11354,BY L. J. L.,
11355,BY L. J. L.,Grandpa thought it advisable to burden the working of the library with
11356,BY L. J. L.,"as few rules as possible, and after careful deliberation he decided"
11357,BY L. J. L.,"upon three which, if strictly adhered to, he thought would be quite"
11358,BY L. J. L.,sufficient.
11359,BY L. J. L.,
11360,BY L. J. L.,"_First_, The library was to be open to the public on three days of each"
11361,BY L. J. L.,"week between the hours of four and six, P.M., _and at no other time_."
11362,BY L. J. L.,Not even for the accommodation of some special friend were books to be
11363,BY L. J. L.,either taken from or returned to the library at irregular hours.
11364,BY L. J. L.,
11365,BY L. J. L.,"_Second_, Borrowers of books were to pay for their use at the rate of"
11366,BY L. J. L.,two cents per day; and were to make good any damage received at their
11367,BY L. J. L.,"hands; and last but by no means least, no running accounts were to be"
11368,BY L. J. L.,"allowed. Every book was to be paid for when returned, otherwise the"
11369,BY L. J. L.,delinquent person was to be denied another until the indebtedness was
11370,BY L. J. L.,cancelled.
11371,BY L. J. L.,
11372,BY L. J. L.,"Grandpa’s idea in this was not so much to prevent loss, as to instil"
11373,BY L. J. L.,into the minds of Janet and her friends correct business habits.
11374,BY L. J. L.,
11375,BY L. J. L.,"He reasoned, very correctly, that if a person contracted the habit of"
11376,BY L. J. L.,incurring debt in youth it would be very likely to follow him through
11377,BY L. J. L.,"life; therefore, even in so small a matter as this he thought it wisest"
11378,BY L. J. L.,and best to be careful and exact.
11379,BY L. J. L.,
11380,BY L. J. L.,"Everything being in readiness, Janet announced her project by"
11381,BY L. J. L.,"distributing among her schoolmates a few neatly written notices,"
11382,BY L. J. L.,"containing a statement of her plan of lending books, and the rules to"
11383,BY L. J. L.,"be observed, and then in a few courteous words invited patronage."
11384,BY L. J. L.,
11385,BY L. J. L.,Such a commotion as this simple announcement created! The questions
11386,BY L. J. L.,and explanations which arose from all sides were something to be
11387,BY L. J. L.,remembered: “Whatever had made her think of such a thing? Could any one
11388,BY L. J. L.,have a book that wished? and must every one pay? Surely she would make
11389,BY L. J. L.,"exceptions in favor of her dearest, dearest friends?” until poor Janet"
11390,BY L. J. L.,was fairly bewildered.
11391,BY L. J. L.,
11392,BY L. J. L.,"But she finally succeeded in making them understand all about it,"
11393,BY L. J. L.,and why it would be necessary to conduct the library with strict
11394,BY L. J. L.,impartiality by showing them how unjust it would be to favor one above
11395,BY L. J. L.,another.
11396,BY L. J. L.,
11397,BY L. J. L.,Two or three of her most intimate friends were at first a little
11398,BY L. J. L.,inclined to feel themselves personally aggrieved at this; but their
11399,BY L. J. L.,"better judgment soon convinced them of their error, and on the day of"
11400,BY L. J. L.,opening these were the very first to present themselves.
11401,BY L. J. L.,
11402,BY L. J. L.,"The eagerness with which others followed, and the number of books taken"
11403,BY L. J. L.,on this day proved that Janet’s venture had met with sufficient favor
11404,BY L. J. L.,to warrant its success.
11405,BY L. J. L.,
11406,BY L. J. L.,"And Janet proved a good manager, too. When the hour for opening the"
11407,BY L. J. L.,"library arrived, she took her place by the table before the open"
11408,BY L. J. L.,"record-book, and as fast as each one made a choice of a book she wrote"
11409,BY L. J. L.,"under the proper date its number and the name of the taker, leaving"
11410,BY L. J. L.,"on the same line a blank space where the date of return, and amount"
11411,BY L. J. L.,"received for use, was to be daily recorded."
11412,BY L. J. L.,
11413,BY L. J. L.,Both magazines and fully two-thirds of the books were taken on this
11414,BY L. J. L.,"first day; but, as was to be expected, this was rather above the"
11415,BY L. J. L.,average on succeeding days. Still the demand for books continued fair
11416,BY L. J. L.,"throughout the winter, and also through the spring and summer months,"
11417,BY L. J. L.,one set of readers succeeding another until there was scarcely a house
11418,BY L. J. L.,in the village where one or more books from Janet’s little library had
11419,BY L. J. L.,not found its way.
11420,BY L. J. L.,
11421,BY L. J. L.,"And wherever they went they carried a good influence with them,"
11422,BY L. J. L.,one which tarried and before long became manifest in several
11423,BY L. J. L.,"different ways. For, besides being bright and interesting, affording"
11424,BY L. J. L.,"entertainment of a high order, there was not one which did not teach"
11425,BY L. J. L.,"some useful lesson, inculcate some pure and noble sentiment, or show"
11426,BY L. J. L.,the beauty and desirability of brave and unselfish purposes.
11427,BY L. J. L.,
11428,BY L. J. L.,And so these few good books became a refining and inspiring element in
11429,BY L. J. L.,"the young society of this retired, humdrum little village, such as had"
11430,BY L. J. L.,"never been felt there before, and from which the young people profited"
11431,BY L. J. L.,to a surprising degree.
11432,BY L. J. L.,
11433,BY L. J. L.,"Throughout the entire school this good influence was especially felt,"
11434,BY L. J. L.,"helping the boys to grow more manly and courteous, the girls to become"
11435,BY L. J. L.,"gentle and more attentive to their studies, while yet sacrificing"
11436,BY L. J. L.,nothing of their accustomed jollity but its rudeness and carelessness.
11437,BY L. J. L.,
11438,BY L. J. L.,"The boys and girls were not, to all appearances, conscious of the"
11439,BY L. J. L.,"change in themselves, nor had they been would many have recognized its"
11440,BY L. J. L.,source; but their elders were not slow to discover the little leaven at
11441,BY L. J. L.,"work in their midst, nor to benefit by the suggestion of a duty owed to"
11442,BY L. J. L.,"themselves and families which this contained, as the unusual number"
11443,BY L. J. L.,of subscribers to some of our best periodical literature the following
11444,BY L. J. L.,year amply testified.
11445,BY L. J. L.,
11446,BY L. J. L.,"As the year was about drawing to a close, grandpa looked over Janet’s"
11447,BY L. J. L.,record-book to ascertain what had been the measure of the pecuniary
11448,BY L. J. L.,reward of the enterprise; and this is what he learned: The different
11449,BY L. J. L.,"patrons of the library numbered nearly one hundred, a few having read"
11450,BY L. J. L.,"every one of the books, while others had taken not more than one or"
11451,BY L. J. L.,two. But of the thirty-five books each and every one had been out
11452,BY L. J. L.,"several times, and as some had proved greater favorites than others,"
11453,BY L. J. L.,grandpa made a general average of time upon the whole of _one hundred
11454,BY L. J. L.,"days each_--equal to thirty-five hundred days--which, at two cents per"
11455,BY L. J. L.,"day, had brought a return of seventy dollars. The magazines, evidently,"
11456,BY L. J. L.,"had been the greatest favorites of all, as the record showed that they"
11457,BY L. J. L.,"had been out fully three-fourths of the time, and had earned a trifle"
11458,BY L. J. L.,over ten dollars.
11459,BY L. J. L.,
11460,BY L. J. L.,"This, added to the earnings of the bound books, made the nice sum of"
11461,BY L. J. L.,eighty dollars in something less than one year--thirty dollars over and
11462,BY L. J. L.,"above the original investment--while not one book was lost, nor one so"
11463,BY L. J. L.,badly worn that it would not do good service some time longer.
11464,BY L. J. L.,
11465,BY L. J. L.,To say that grandpa was delighted at this showing would be but a feeble
11466,BY L. J. L.,expression of his feelings; and when the facts in regard to the success
11467,BY L. J. L.,"of her undertaking were laid before Janet’s friends, they were so well"
11468,BY L. J. L.,pleased that their united judgment was in favor of a continuance of the
11469,BY L. J. L.,"work, advising that she withdraw the thirty dollars profit and put this"
11470,BY L. J. L.,"amount out on interest, while the original sum should be reinvested in"
11471,BY L. J. L.,new books.
11472,BY L. J. L.,
11473,BY L. J. L.,This was quite in accordance with her own wishes; and as the year had
11474,BY L. J. L.,"been prolific of cheap editions of old and standard works, as well as"
11475,BY L. J. L.,"of many new ones, she was enabled to increase her stock to over one"
11476,BY L. J. L.,"hundred choice volumes suited to both old and young readers, naturally"
11477,BY L. J. L.,increasing the number of her patrons and adding greatly to the
11478,BY L. J. L.,popularity of the little library. And although only about one-fourth
11479,BY L. J. L.,"of the second year has elapsed, the people of the village are already"
11480,BY L. J. L.,beginning to look upon Janet’s library as one of the permanent and
11481,BY L. J. L.,"praiseworthy institutions of the town, many talking confidently of"
11482,BY L. J. L.,a time in the near future when it shall comprise many hundreds of

11493,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"I had just sat down to my dinner, Christmas Day, when there was a"
11494,BY A. W. LYMAN.,distant shout down the street; then another still nearer. The policeman
11495,BY A. W. LYMAN.,on the corner sounded his rattle for reinforcements; there was the
11496,BY A. W. LYMAN.,sharp clatter of hoofs on the paving stones; two pistol shots in quick
11497,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"succession, and the confused murmur of many voices. I rushed to the"
11498,BY A. W. LYMAN.,window in time to see an excited crowd gathered about a prostrate and
11499,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"wounded steer, a fugitive from a passing drove of Texas cattle. There"
11500,BY A. W. LYMAN.,was little damage done by his mad flight; the old newsman on the corner
11501,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"was knocked down and sustained trifling injuries, and the excitement"
11502,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"was soon over. The wounded animal was taken away in a wagon, and I"
11503,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"resumed my dinner, with my mind on the Texas steer. “Poor fellow!” I"
11504,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"mused, “you have a long, hard journey of it from Texas to roast beef!”"
11505,BY A. W. LYMAN.,and I began mentally to follow him in his successive steps.
11506,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11507,BY A. W. LYMAN.,From the peculiar figure which I saw on his flank as he lay in
11508,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"the street, I could trace him back through two thousand miles of"
11509,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"wanderings, down to the ranche of Col. Mifflin Kennedy, where he was"
11510,BY A. W. LYMAN.,born.
11511,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11512,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"There are three or four larger ranches in Texas, but Kennedy’s is a"
11513,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"model in its way, and a brief description of it will give an idea"
11514,BY A. W. LYMAN.,of the manner in which stock-growing is carried on here. Kennedy’s
11515,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"ranche is a peninsula, comprising more than one hundred thousand acres"
11516,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"of land, projecting into the gulf between the Neuces and Rio Grande"
11517,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"rivers. On three sides of this tract are the waters of the gulf, so"
11518,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"that all the owner had to do was to build a fence on the land side, and"
11519,BY A. W. LYMAN.,his farm was enclosed. But this was not so easy a task as one might
11520,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"think, for this fence of stout planks is thirty-one miles long. At"
11521,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"intervals of three miles along the fence are little villages, groups"
11522,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"of houses for the herders, stables for their horses, and pens for the"
11523,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"stock. Within the enclosure roam about forty thousand cattle, ranging"
11524,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"in size from young calves to three-year-olds, and perhaps as many more"
11525,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"horses, sheep and goats."
11526,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11527,BY A. W. LYMAN.,I should guess that our steer began his first experience with life
11528,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"at Kennedy’s, on an early spring day. A spring day in March, the"
11529,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"very thought of which makes you shiver, is in Texas a season of bud"
11530,BY A. W. LYMAN.,and blossom and singing birds. The new grass is thrusting its bright
11531,BY A. W. LYMAN.,green blades up through the brown and faded tufts of last year’s dead
11532,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"verdure, the trees are unfolding their leaves and the broad prairies"
11533,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"are white and blue and purple by turns, with the early wild flowers"
11534,BY A. W. LYMAN.,which grow in beds miles in extent.

11538,BY A. W. LYMAN.,The little calf has enjoyed a happy existence of a few days amid scenes
11539,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"like this, when his first sorrow comes--an experience much like that"
11540,BY A. W. LYMAN.,of the baby with vaccination. This is the branding process which he
11541,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"must undergo, a hot iron being placed against his flank, which burns"
11542,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"off the hair, and imprints upon the tender hide a mark--a sort of"
11543,BY A. W. LYMAN.,monogram--which he never outgrows--and which serves to distinguish him
11544,BY A. W. LYMAN.,forever from the cattle of other ranches. In Texas every stock-grower
11545,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"has his own peculiar brand, which is registered with the proper"
11546,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"official, and no person is permitted to use that mark besides himself."
11547,BY A. W. LYMAN.,By this means cattle that wander away or are stolen can be singled out
11548,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"wherever found, as you see I recognized our wanderer in New York."
11549,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11550,BY A. W. LYMAN.,After the branding the calf is turned loose to make his living on the
11551,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"plains, and for two or three years he leads a life of absolute freedom."
11552,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"He rapidly grows tall, gaunt, uncouth and belligerent, and by the time"
11553,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"he is a full-fledged steer, what with his immensely long horns, shaggy"
11554,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"hair, and wild-rolling eyes, he is a fierce-looking fellow. I have a"
11555,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"pair of horns taken from a steer in Western Texas, which measure more"
11556,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"than five feet across from tip to tip, and this is not a remarkably"
11557,BY A. W. LYMAN.,large measurement.
11558,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11559,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"When our steer is not more than three years old, he enters upon another"
11560,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"stage of his existence, which for him ends ingloriously, in a few"
11561,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"months, in a Northern slaughter-house. Some spring day, such as I have"
11562,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"described, the cattle-buyer appears, and the steer changes owners."
11563,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11564,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"The collecting and assorting of the herds for the drive Northward, on"
11565,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"the fenced ranches in the settled portions of the State, are easily"
11566,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"accomplished; but in the grazing regions further west, where the cattle"
11567,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"roam without limit, this work is both difficult and perilous. The"
11568,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"cattle in these remote regions are mostly bought by a class of bold,"
11569,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"daring men, of long experience on the frontier, known as “out-riders,”"
11570,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"who buy and collect the cattle from the stock-raiser, and sell them to"
11571,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the speculators from the north.
11572,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11573,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"The outrider fills his saddle-bags, and most likely a belt which"
11574,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"he wears around his waist, with gold coin to the amount of tens of"
11575,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"thousands of dollars, for in the section of country he visits there"
11576,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"are no banks; and, taking a few trusty companions, all well mounted"
11577,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"and armed, sets out on his long journey, beset by constant danger from"
11578,BY A. W. LYMAN.,lurking Indians and white outlaws who infest this wild country.
11579,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11580,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"The stock-grower who has lived remote from the settlements, perhaps"
11581,BY A. W. LYMAN.,seeing no human being except the owner of a neighboring ranche for a
11582,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"year, looks upon the “outrider’s” visit as an event in his existence."

11584,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"He is a most hospitable host, and for several days after his guest’s"
11585,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"arrival no business is thought of, and a season of feasting, riding and"
11586,BY A. W. LYMAN.,hunting is observed. When this is over they begin their negotiations.
11587,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11588,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"The herds are scanned over to get some idea of their condition, but"
11589,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the cattle are not carefully counted and weighed as stock is in the
11590,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"North. The herds are simply sold “as they run.” That is, the owner"
11591,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"looks through his book to see how many cattle he has branded, and the"
11592,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"“outrider” pays him so much for his brand, which entitles the buyer to"
11593,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"all the cattle that he can find in scouring the prairies, which bear"
11594,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the purchased mark.
11595,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11596,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"There is considerable sport and a great deal of hard, rough riding in"
11597,BY A. W. LYMAN.,getting the wild herds together and assorting them. It is in this work
11598,BY A. W. LYMAN.,that the splendid horsemanship and wonderful skill with the lasso or

11610,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11611,BY A. W. LYMAN.,There are few incidents to enliven the wearisome weeks that follow. The

11616,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"For days and days human habitations are lost sight of, and the droves"

11618,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"quite alone, either--I came near forgetting that bright and cheerful"
11619,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"companion of the drove, the cow-bird, a brown little fellow about the"
11620,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"size of the well-known chipping-sparrow, or “chippy,” as the boys call"

11622,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"gleefully on a tall, swaying weed, the next perching saucily on the"
11623,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"tip of a steer’s horns, perhaps at night roosting complacently on his"

11634,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"Although, as I have said, there are few incidents to interrupt the"

11636,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"experiences. In former years Indian attacks were not infrequent, and"
11637,BY A. W. LYMAN.,many a brave band of herders has been surrounded and killed by the
11638,BY A. W. LYMAN.,savages whose hunting-grounds were encroached upon by the droves. There
11639,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"is always danger, too, of stampedes in the herds, caused either by the"
11640,BY A. W. LYMAN.,terrific thunder-storms and tornadoes which burst upon the great plains
11641,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"without warning, or by the “cattle thieves,”--bands of white, Indian,"
11642,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"or half-breed outlaws, who live by stealing stray cattle from the"
11643,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"herds, and sell them or kill them for their hides. Having in his early"
11644,BY A. W. LYMAN.,life encountered one or more of the devastating prairie fires which
11645,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"sweep over the great, dry pastures almost every fall, the slightest"
11646,BY A. W. LYMAN.,smell of smoke or sight of flame will plunge the steer into a panic of
11647,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"fright, and this well-known circumstance is turned to advantage by the"

11649,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11650,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"Getting some distance to windward of a herd on a dark night, the rogues"

11653,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"gives the alarm, ten thousand pairs of horns are reared aloft in air,"
11654,BY A. W. LYMAN.,and one united snort of terror is heard. Before the herders can mount

11658,BY A. W. LYMAN.,with a noise like the roll of distant thunder. They scatter beyond hope
11659,BY A. W. LYMAN.,of recovery. In the confusion following upon the heels of the stampede
11660,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the thieves succeed in driving off scores and sometimes hundreds of the

11665,BY A. W. LYMAN.,There are other incidents that I could narrate of amusing and exciting
11666,BY A. W. LYMAN.,adventures during the drive. One episode I now recall of my first trip
11667,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"over the great cattle trail, was the encountering of a large herd of"
11668,BY A. W. LYMAN.,buffaloes which became intermingled with our cattle just after we
11669,BY A. W. LYMAN.,crossed the Arkansas River in Southern Kansas. The buffaloes became
11670,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"so bewildered that they marched along with the cattle, and the young"
11671,BY A. W. LYMAN.,Texans enjoyed rare sport for two days in lassoing them. We had a
11672,BY A. W. LYMAN.,welcome variety in our scanty bill of fare by the addition of tongue
11673,BY A. W. LYMAN.,and other choice tid-bits to our larder.
11674,BY A. W. LYMAN.,
11675,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"As the railroads are neared the drive becomes more and more tiresome,"
11676,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"and the Texas herders, longing for the wider freedom of the plains,"
11677,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"are not sorry to have it end. But the steer, if he could peep into the"
11678,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"future, would be sorry to have the journey brought to a close, for with"
11679,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"the railroad the romance of his career is over, and the last two weeks"
11680,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"of his life are full of hunger, thirst and suffering. The great droves"
11681,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"are divided into small herds, and distributed among the hundreds of"
11682,BY A. W. LYMAN.,stock pens. After a rest of a few days the last journey is begun. With
11683,BY A. W. LYMAN.,eighteen or twenty of his companions the steer is taken from the pens
11684,BY A. W. LYMAN.,and stowed away in the cattle-car--a sort of gigantic coop on wheels.
11685,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"There is neither room to turn around nor to lie down, so closely are"
11686,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the poor fellows wedged in. Now and then a steer contrives to get
11687,BY A. W. LYMAN.,down on his knees at the risk of being trampled under the feet of his
11688,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"neighbors, but he gains little rest in this way."

11690,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"The cattle trains run slowly, and from ten or twelve days are occupied"

11692,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"hundred miles the trains are stopped and the cattle are taken off,"
11693,BY A. W. LYMAN.,placed in pens and fed and watered. After a rest of twenty-four hours
11694,BY A. W. LYMAN.,the journey is again resumed. During the continuous runs of three
11695,BY A. W. LYMAN.,hundred miles--about thirty hours in time--the poor creatures are
11696,BY A. W. LYMAN.,"without food or drink, and their suffering, especially in warm weather,"

11723,CATTLE.”],humane men have for years been studying the question of live stock
11724,CATTLE.”],"transportation, and some day not long distant means will be found to"
11725,CATTLE.”],lessen the sufferings of the steer in his railroad trip to New York.
11726,CATTLE.”],Even no less a personage than a United States Senator has devoted many
11727,CATTLE.”],"years to this subject, and I am not sure but more real fame will attach"
11728,CATTLE.”],to the name of the Hon. John B. McPherson of New Jersey for a recent
11729,CATTLE.”],invention to relieve suffering cattle than he will earn in the Senate
11730,CATTLE.”],Chamber; at any rate he is entitled to everlasting gratitude from all
11731,CATTLE.”],the sons and daughters of Bos.
11732,CATTLE.”],
11733,CATTLE.”],The invention to which I refer is a simple arrangement for feeding and
11734,CATTLE.”],"watering stock on the cars, and consists of a trough for water which"
11735,CATTLE.”],revolves on a pivot so as to be readily cleaned and inverted when not
11736,CATTLE.”],"in use; and a folding rack for hay, which can be shut up out of the way"
11737,CATTLE.”],when empty. Experiments with Mr. McPherson’s invention have proved its
11738,CATTLE.”],"usefulness, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company will soon have two"
11739,CATTLE.”],hundred cars built with his improvement. With a well-filled rack before
11740,CATTLE.”],"him, and fresh water always within reach, the steer will be able to get"
11741,CATTLE.”],"through the journey with a tolerable degree of comfort, even though he"
11742,CATTLE.”],is without a bed to lie upon.
11743,CATTLE.”],
11744,CATTLE.”],"The cattle-yards in our large cities, acres of small, square pens,"
11745,CATTLE.”],"ranged in long rows, with narrow lanes between, are familiar and not"
11746,CATTLE.”],"particularly inviting places, and, luckily for the steer, his life"
11747,CATTLE.”],there is short. Landed from the cars he is driven into one of the small
11748,CATTLE.”],"pens with about thirty others, where he stays for a day or two without"
11749,CATTLE.”],"experiencing any new incident in his life, except that he is poked and"
11750,CATTLE.”],yelled at by any number of beef-buyers who want to learn his condition.
11751,CATTLE.”],Poor fellow! It makes little difference what condition he may be
11752,CATTLE.”],"in, for there are a million mouths to feed in the city over there,"
11753,CATTLE.”],"and three thousand miles across the blue ocean yonder, those pursy"
11754,CATTLE.”],Englishmen are calling for “American beef!”
11755,CATTLE.”],
11756,CATTLE.”],"About the second morning after his railroad journey is finished, and"
11757,CATTLE.”],"our steer is in the Jersey stock pens, a dirty-looking old ferry-boat"
11758,CATTLE.”],runs up alongside the wharf. The gates are opened and the cattle go
11759,CATTLE.”],"rushing pell-mell on deck, where they find themselves in pens similar"
11760,CATTLE.”],to those they have just left. Twenty minutes steaming up and across the
11761,CATTLE.”],"Hudson River, and the steamer ties up at the Thirty-fourth Street dock"
11762,CATTLE.”],in New York.
11763,CATTLE.”],
11764,CATTLE.”],"Manhattan Market, where the cattle are going, is that large brick"
11765,CATTLE.”],building nearly two blocks away from the river. The river-front and the
11766,CATTLE.”],broad avenue between the landing and the market are crowded with piles
11767,CATTLE.”],"of freight, and heavily-loaded trucks, and we instinctively wonder how"
11768,CATTLE.”],the timid and frightened cattle can ever be driven through such jam and
11769,CATTLE.”],confusion. At many of the landings this work has been attended with the
11770,CATTLE.”],"greatest difficulty; accidents have been of frequent occurrence, and"
11771,CATTLE.”],"many cattle have escaped and rushed madly through the crowded streets,"

11776,CATTLE.”],But the cattle dealers have overcome this obstacle just as the
11777,CATTLE.”],railroads conquer the mountains and rocks--by tunneling. As the cattle
11778,CATTLE.”],"come from the boat they pass under an archway, and find themselves"
11779,CATTLE.”],"in an underground passage, a long tunnel dug many feet underneath"
11780,CATTLE.”],buildings and streets. The further end of the tunnel opens in the
11781,CATTLE.”],"abattoir, or slaughter-house, and the cattle come out face to face"
11782,CATTLE.”],"with fate in the shape of a hundred butchers, who stand with gleaming"
11783,CATTLE.”],"knives awaiting their victims. The cattle are driven forward. Overhead,"
11784,CATTLE.”],"fastened to strong cross-beams, is a windlass, around which a rope is"
11785,CATTLE.”],coiled. A stout iron hook hanging from the end of the rope is seized
11786,CATTLE.”],"by one of the butchers, who deftly catches it around the hind leg of"
11787,CATTLE.”],"a steer. The windlass is turned, and in a trice the poor fellow is"
11788,CATTLE.”],"swinging in mid-air, head downward. A huge tin pan is slipped under"
11789,CATTLE.”],"his head, and a long knife, keen-edged as a razor, is drawn across his"
11790,CATTLE.”],"throat. The life-blood gushes out in a dark stream, and in less time"
11791,CATTLE.”],"than it takes to tell it our steer ceases to exist, and becomes beef."
11792,CATTLE.”],
11793,CATTLE.”],We shall not have time to watch the process of cutting up and the

11795,CATTLE.”],into the hands of the man with the hook until he is hung up two halves
11796,CATTLE.”],"of beef occupies eleven minutes, and on a trial of skill between the"
11797,CATTLE.”],butchers the work has been done in eight minutes. But this is a small
11798,CATTLE.”],part of the work. The pan of blood has to be taken to the tanks in
11799,CATTLE.”],"the adjoining room, where it is dried and made into a fertilizer to"
11800,CATTLE.”],enrich the earth; the horns are saved for the comb manufacturer; the
11801,CATTLE.”],large bones in the head are sent to the button factory; the hide to a
11802,CATTLE.”],tannery; the hoofs to the glue and gelatine makers. The tripe man comes
11803,CATTLE.”],"around for the stomach; one man buys all the tongues, and another has a"
11804,CATTLE.”],"contract for all the tails; and so on, until every scrap is disposed of."
11805,CATTLE.”],
11806,CATTLE.”],If we visit the abattoir on a cold day we shall see perhaps three

11808,CATTLE.”],weather we shall have to take a peep into one of those gigantic
11809,CATTLE.”],"refrigerators yonder, each of which holds three hundred cattle. The"
11810,CATTLE.”],meat is suspended from hooks over a vast bed of ice which keeps the air
11811,CATTLE.”],at a temperature of thirty-eight degrees. Similar refrigerators have
11812,CATTLE.”],"been built recently in the holds of vessels, and with forty tons of ice"
11813,CATTLE.”],three hundred beeves have been safely transported to Liverpool and sold

11815,CATTLE.”],
11816,CATTLE.”],"Around the door, as we pass out, is a group of pale, hollow-faced men,"

11876,BY M. E. W. S.,
11877,BY M. E. W. S.,"“You shoot it, grandma!”"
11878,BY M. E. W. S.,
11879,BY M. E. W. S.,"“I don’t know how to shoot--and, well--I am afraid of a gun, because I"
11880,BY M. E. W. S.,"am a woman!” said Mrs. Luke, who was known in all the mining region as"
11881,BY M. E. W. S.,"“Granny Luke”--more because she called herself so, than because anybody"
11882,BY M. E. W. S.,else gave her that title.
11883,BY M. E. W. S.,
11884,BY M. E. W. S.,"She was an “old country” woman who, having lost her children, was left"
11885,BY M. E. W. S.,with a number of young grandchildren to bring up. Fate had wafted her
11886,BY M. E. W. S.,"to the lead mines in Iowa, down by one of which she had settled in a"
11887,BY M. E. W. S.,"log cabin, and had picked up a living by boarding the miners, attending"
11888,BY M. E. W. S.,"to them in sickness, and by sending her eldest, Tim, down the shaft"
11889,BY M. E. W. S.,"with the miners’ dinners. A lead mine is worked far under ground, from"
11890,BY M. E. W. S.,a shaft which is sunk like a bucket in a well. Tim was not afraid to
11891,BY M. E. W. S.,"go down this bucket, nor to crawl on his hands and knees far into"
11892,BY M. E. W. S.,"Yorkshire Tom’s lead, with a tallow candle in his cap, to carry the"
11893,BY M. E. W. S.,"miner his dinner; nor did he dread an occasional rattlesnake, who,"
11894,BY M. E. W. S.,"coiled at the mouth of the cave, would often ring his deadly rattle"
11895,BY M. E. W. S.,"at the boy. No, Tim was inured to danger, and he knew how to give the"
11896,BY M. E. W. S.,"rattlesnake a good tap over his ugly head with a stick, and silence his"
11897,BY M. E. W. S.,hiss forever; and he knew how to measure and guard against the equally
11898,BY M. E. W. S.,"poisonous air, in some parts of the mine, by the uncertain flame of his"
11899,BY M. E. W. S.,candle.
11900,BY M. E. W. S.,
11901,BY M. E. W. S.,But he could not “_shoot the creature_.” Love made him a coward.
11902,BY M. E. W. S.,
11903,BY M. E. W. S.,"For the “creature” was a beautiful fawn, the loveliest, soft eyed,"
11904,BY M. E. W. S.,"tender pet that ever lived, whom Tim had trained and fed and educated,"
11905,BY M. E. W. S.,and brought in from the prairie when the fawn was a baby. Some hunters
11906,BY M. E. W. S.,"had shot the pretty doe, the fawn’s mother, and Tim had educated the"
11907,BY M. E. W. S.,orphan.
11908,BY M. E. W. S.,
11909,BY M. E. W. S.,Granny Luke had a little garden where she raised with her own hands a
11910,BY M. E. W. S.,"few vegetables, highly prized by the miners. The fawn had shown a great"
11911,BY M. E. W. S.,"appreciation of early cabbage sprouts, green peas, beet tops and other"
11912,BY M. E. W. S.,"succulent green things. No bars could keep him out, and no ropes could"
11913,BY M. E. W. S.,"tie this gentle robber. He would jump over everything, and he nibbled"
11914,BY M. E. W. S.,so neatly and judiciously that Granny Luke’s garden had been ruined
11915,BY M. E. W. S.,"several times, and now her really long-suffering patience was at an"
11916,BY M. E. W. S.,end.

11918,BY M. E. W. S.,"“No early peas and no late peas, no corn, no squash, no lettuce, no"

11922,BY M. E. W. S.,
11923,BY M. E. W. S.,"She loved Primrose, too--as Tim had named the pretty fawn, whom he"
11924,BY M. E. W. S.,"found deserted, lying on a bed of those yellow flowers which grow in"
11925,BY M. E. W. S.,"tufts on the prairie. Primrose had tears in his big eyes, and was"
11926,BY M. E. W. S.,"crying for his mother just like a human baby, when Tim found him and"
11927,BY M. E. W. S.,brought him home in his arms. Granny Luke had fed him with warm milk

11929,BY M. E. W. S.,"tender age; but those days were past, and Primrose was growing every"
11930,BY M. E. W. S.,"day to be a buck of promise; and although he was tame enough to them,"
11931,BY M. E. W. S.,his moral nature could not be cultivated to know that while it was
11932,BY M. E. W. S.,"proper to eat green boughs and the coarse grass of the prairie, it was"

11935,BY M. E. W. S.,"Granny Luke gardened like a German woman, and sowed her water-cresses"

11943,BY M. E. W. S.,"to greet Tim, when he crawled up out of the well-like bucket and from"
11944,BY M. E. W. S.,"the cold, dark mine into the sun, and ready to offer him the warm"
11945,BY M. E. W. S.,"friendship of his own well-furred neck, as the poor boy threw an arm"
11946,BY M. E. W. S.,"around his four-footed friend, and the twain sat down, to an out door"

11948,BY M. E. W. S.,
11949,BY M. E. W. S.,"And now his grandma wished him to shoot this intimate, dear, beautiful"

11956,BY M. E. W. S.,
11957,BY M. E. W. S.,Poor Tim shuddered. Granny Luke’s sensibilities had been blunted by
11958,BY M. E. W. S.,"time, and hard work and poverty. She had been doing very well in her"
11959,BY M. E. W. S.,affairs--thanks to the friendship of the General Superintendent of
11960,BY M. E. W. S.,"the mines, an old-country friend of her’s; and as he appreciated her"
11961,BY M. E. W. S.,"excellent cooking, and fresh vegetables, she occasionally gave him and"
11962,BY M. E. W. S.,his fellow officers a good dinner. Primrose was to be offered up to
11963,BY M. E. W. S.,"two passions--revenge and avarice--for as he ate her spinach, he must"
11964,BY M. E. W. S.,therefore be eaten.
11965,BY M. E. W. S.,
11966,BY M. E. W. S.,"The group was standing outside the cabin door, Tim leaning irresolutely"
11967,BY M. E. W. S.,"on his gun; Granny Luke, her arms akimbo, looking at him; and Primrose,"
11968,BY M. E. W. S.,"as beautiful as only a fawn can be, was calmly nibbling the lower"
11969,BY M. E. W. S.,branches of a tree. Animals are better off than we are; they never
11970,BY M. E. W. S.,suffer from anxiety. So Primrose had no possible idea that those
11971,BY M. E. W. S.,branches might be the last which he would ever munch. He looked up at
11972,BY M. E. W. S.,Mrs. Luke and her grandson and gave a friendly “_neigh!_”
11973,BY M. E. W. S.,
11974,BY M. E. W. S.,"This upset Tim, and he burst out a-crying: “I can’t shoot him!"
11975,BY M. E. W. S.,Granny--and I won’t!”
11976,BY M. E. W. S.,
11977,BY M. E. W. S.,"There came round the corner of the house a slow, massive tread. It was"

11979,BY M. E. W. S.,
11980,BY M. E. W. S.,"“What’s all this! what’s all this!” said the man, catching Mrs. Luke’s"

11982,BY M. E. W. S.,
11983,BY M. E. W. S.,"“The boy is disobedient, and refuses to shoot Primrose,” said the stern"

11985,BY M. E. W. S.,
11986,BY M. E. W. S.,"Yorkshire Tom was a patient man, and he staid a half hour to listen to"
11987,BY M. E. W. S.,the ins and outs of this curious case. He liked Tim and had felt his

11989,BY M. E. W. S.,"his cap, came creeping through the dark alleys bringing him a dinner,"
11990,BY M. E. W. S.,and staying to chat awhile of the bright upper earth.
11991,BY M. E. W. S.,
11992,BY M. E. W. S.,"“Now, Dame, thee’s a little hard on the young un! ain’t thee!” said"

11999,BY M. E. W. S.,"It was ten o’clock, of a moonlight night, when Tim came wearily home,"
12000,BY M. E. W. S.,"with a saddle of venison on his back. Although he was weary, he looked"
12001,BY M. E. W. S.,"bright, and his cheeks very red--perhaps from the exercise."

12003,BY M. E. W. S.,"“A large, plump saddle!” said his grandmother, “I had no idea Primrose"

12005,BY M. E. W. S.,"for the General--why, boy, you look feverish. I must give you some"
12006,BY M. E. W. S.,"peppermint tea! So Yorkshire Tom did it, did he? Well, Tim, you tell"

12016,BY M. E. W. S.,"cooking, and did not hesitate to utter a few words of praise over her"
12017,BY M. E. W. S.,departed Primrose! We often think of virtues in our friends after they

12026,BY M. E. W. S.,"But Granny Luke missed the fawn more and more, and she saw her spinach"

12029,BY M. E. W. S.,"her grandchildren left her for their tasks, and no Primrose came to"

12031,BY M. E. W. S.,
12032,BY M. E. W. S.,"She awoke one day feeling rather unwell, and as she was tying her cap"
12033,BY M. E. W. S.,"over her gray hairs, which were her crown of glory, she saw a little"

12035,BY M. E. W. S.,
12036,BY M. E. W. S.,"It frightened her; not because she cared for the little snake, but"
12037,BY M. E. W. S.,because the miners believe it an evil omen if a snake crawls into a

12041,BY M. E. W. S.,
12042,BY M. E. W. S.,"However, she drove the snake away, and went about her household tasks."
12043,BY M. E. W. S.,Tim was sent off with the miners’ breakfast--her other grandchildren
12044,BY M. E. W. S.,were fed and sent out to pick out the shining bits of metal from a heap

12046,BY M. E. W. S.,"week’s washing. She had got about half through when she, fairly tired,"
12047,BY M. E. W. S.,"let the soap fall, rubbed her arms dry, and thought she would look at"
12048,BY M. E. W. S.,her spinach and see how it was growing.
12049,BY M. E. W. S.,
12050,BY M. E. W. S.,“Oh! gracious goodness!” what did she see?

12056,BY M. E. W. S.,“I knew it! I knew it!” said Granny Luke. “I knew when I saw that

12060,BY M. E. W. S.,Granny Luke’s courage was all gone. Primrose was dead--and she had

12110,PART I.,
12111,PART I.,Billy used to read Sir Walter Scott’s poems when he was not much larger
12112,PART I.,"than the book, his sisters say. From Sir Walter he received the idea"
12113,PART I.,that there is no such thing as a hero without his steed and hounds.
12114,PART I.,"Although Billy did not aim at being a hero exactly, he by no means"
12115,PART I.,called himself a coward; and he considered a horse and dog as necessary
12116,PART I.,"to a daring, manly fellow as to a regular hero."
12117,PART I.,
12118,PART I.,The horse Billy confidently expected to own when he should come into
12119,PART I.,long-tailed coats and moustaches. He knew the high price of a good
12120,PART I.,"article, and was willing to wait; but a “trusty hound,” which he could"
12121,PART I.,"have for the asking, he wanted at once. All the boys belonging to his"
12122,PART I.,"little clan either owned, or had some time owned, a dog; and when the"
12123,PART I.,huntsmen set out for the chase (in pursuit of such noble game as nuts
12124,PART I.,"or apples, birds’ eggs or nests) the dogs followed their masters."
12125,PART I.,Those who were not followed had tales to tell--either of mysterious
12126,PART I.,strangers who had lurked about the premises and enticed their dogs away
12127,PART I.,"on account of their immense market value, or of bloody street fights in"
12128,PART I.,which their brave ones had perished. Each boy except Billy had had his
12129,PART I.,"experience, and if not the present possessor of a hound, could boast"
12130,PART I.,the noble pedigree or gallant death of one departed.
12131,PART I.,
12132,PART I.,"But it was not altogether Sir Walter, nor an ambition to be the owner"
12133,PART I.,"of a high-born warrior, which made Billy long for a dog; he was born"
12134,PART I.,"with a love for them as certain people are born with a love for babies,"
12135,PART I.,and he had many fancies about his hound which were not of a bold and
12136,PART I.,bloody nature. He pictured him affectionate and gentle. He pictured him
12137,PART I.,comfortably dozing by the fire on winter evenings; sharing a corner of
12138,PART I.,his room at night; sharing his last crust should changing fortunes make
12139,PART I.,"them paupers--always faithful, tender and true, a friend to be relied"
12140,PART I.,upon though other friends might fail.
12141,PART I.,
12142,PART I.,[Illustration]
12143,PART I.,
12144,PART I.,Unfortunately he did not inherit his tastes from his father. That
12145,PART I.,"gentleman disliked the canine race in proportion as Billy liked it, and"
12146,PART I.,"although an indulgent parent generally, would not listen to Billy’s"
12147,PART I.,"petitions for a dog. Occasionally, however, Billy received such a"
12148,PART I.,"tempting offer that he was emboldened to renew his pleas, and one day,"
12149,PART I.,"unable to resist the fascination of a fierce little black-and-tan,"
12150,PART I.,began:
12151,PART I.,
12152,PART I.,"“Father, there’s a dog----”"
12153,PART I.,
12154,PART I.,"“Once for all,” interrupted his father, rather noisily, “I say,"
12155,PART I.,"no! Don’t mention that subject to me again, sir! Anything that is"
12156,PART I.,"reasonable, from a parrot to a monkey, I’ll consider. But you are not"
12157,PART I.,"to mention dogs to me again, sir!”"
12158,PART I.,
12159,PART I.,"“You know papa was bitten once, dear,” said his sister, as the door"
12160,PART I.,closed after their angry sire. “You really ought not to tease him. Why
12161,PART I.,"won’t you try and be contented with a dear little kitten, or a canary?”"
12162,PART I.,
12163,PART I.,"“I’d as soon pet a rattlesnake as a kitten,” said Billy; “one is as"
12164,PART I.,mean and sly as the other. And that canary of yours--it’s got just
12165,PART I.,about as much soul as a lump of sugar.”
12166,PART I.,
12167,PART I.,“How would you like a goat? Goats are big and fierce----”
12168,PART I.,
12169,PART I.,"“A goat is a brute,” said Billy. “As for the dog that bit father, you"
12170,PART I.,know it was a bull--the only variety of dog that has any treachery in
12171,PART I.,its blood. I don’t ask to own a bull-dog. But a goat! Do you s’pose
12172,PART I.,Byron could ever have said this about a goat?” (Billy had spoken the
12173,PART I.,"poem at school, and proceeded to declaim):"
12174,PART I.,
12175,PART I.,"“In life the firmest friend,"
12176,PART I.,"The first to welcome, foremost to defend;"
12177,PART I.,Whose honest heart is still his master’s own;
12178,PART I.,"Who labors, fights, lives, breathes for him alone!”"
12179,PART I.,
12180,PART I.,"“I’ll have a dog, or nothing,” he concluded."
12181,PART I.,
12182,PART I.,"“He has his father’s will,” sighed his mother, as he left the room."
12183,PART I.,
12184,PART I.,A few weeks later Billy was rambling home. He had been sent with a
12185,PART I.,dish to an invalid; and between the fear of spilling its contents and
12186,PART I.,the attention he must pay to his steps had had a wretched time; so on
12187,PART I.,the way home he was thoroughly enjoying liberty. Hands were free to
12188,PART I.,"shy stones at balky and rickety horses, and feet were free to roam and"
12189,PART I.,"linger where they listed. He was a long time on that homeward journey,"
12190,PART I.,and only reached the graveyard at half-past four.
12191,PART I.,
12192,PART I.,Billy had been known to quicken his footsteps when passing the
12193,PART I.,graveyard by moonlight; and it is said that once when the sky was dark
12194,PART I.,"above and the night dark beneath, he ran quite around the corner, where"
12195,PART I.,he sauntered and whistled indifferently. But there was no occasion for
12196,PART I.,running to-day. Neither moonlight nor darkness brooded over the graves;
12197,PART I.,"the white stones were dazzling in the sunshine, and the blades of grass"
12198,PART I.,twinkled like so many little stars; birds hopped fearlessly over the
12199,PART I.,"graves, not changing their gay tunes nor lowering their loud voices out"
12200,PART I.,of respect to the place; and altogether the graveyard looked so cheery
12201,PART I.,and tempting in the afternoon sunshine that Billy stepped over the
12202,PART I.,stile.
12203,PART I.,
12204,PART I.,"There was a general scattering of birds, butterflies, chipmunks and"
12205,PART I.,"squirrels, each of these inferior creatures being warned by a voice"
12206,PART I.,in its little breast to flee. A noble dog would have needed no such
12207,PART I.,"warning, but would have approached Billy as an equal, assured of the"
12208,PART I.,reception to which his rank entitled him.
12209,PART I.,
12210,PART I.,"Having sole possession of the premises, Billy strolled about with a"
12211,PART I.,"sovereign air. He pulled off his cap and turned up his face, letting"
12212,PART I.,the sunshine warm his cheeks to red and his yellow hair to gold. He
12213,PART I.,"surveyed the sky with some interest, as there was quite a variety of"
12214,PART I.,"colors to-day, which pleased him better than the ordinary white and"
12215,PART I.,blue that in his opinion too much resembled milk and water. He cut a
12216,PART I.,"willow stick for a whistle, and examined names and dates as he passed"
12217,PART I.,"the tombstones. Arriving at the grave of a boy who had died at his age,"
12218,PART I.,"he sat down, took out his knife, and as he worked whistled cheerily"
12219,PART I.,above the little fellow whose whistling days were over. By and by an
12220,PART I.,occasional chipmunk or squirrel ventured out in search of nuts; and at
12221,PART I.,last a reckless kitten came within throwing distance. It would have
12222,PART I.,been sad for the kitten had the soil been sterile and stony; but in
12223,PART I.,that grassy region there was nothing to throw except the knife and the
12224,PART I.,"stick in the boy’s hands. The knife could by no means be spared, so"
12225,PART I.,away went the whistle with the coward cat before it. As the whistle
12226,PART I.,"was not to be found after a hunt in the thick grass, Billy resumed his"
12227,PART I.,rambles.
12228,PART I.,
12229,PART I.,This brought him back to the stile in course of time; and he lifted
12230,PART I.,a foot to go over when he was stopped by a faint cry. He paused just
12231,PART I.,"as he stood, one foot on the stile and one on the ground, listening"
12232,PART I.,breathlessly; for his educated ear knew the animal by its voice. Faint
12233,PART I.,as the tones were they were unmistakable puppy tones. No kitten’s
12234,PART I.,"fretty “me-ouw,” no squirrel’s soulless “chir-chir,” was there; it was"
12235,PART I.,"the noble voice of a puppy, though so faint and far that Billy could"
12236,PART I.,"not at once detect its source. He listened until the cry came again,"
12237,PART I.,"prolonged and piteous. It was a puppy in distress, a little baby dog in"
12238,PART I.,need of championship! who so ready in the wide world as he to espouse
12239,PART I.,its cause! His knightly soul thrilled with pity as he ran eagerly
12240,PART I.,"about, led hither and thither by the repeated cries. He grew wild as"
12241,PART I.,he could not find the puppy behind a tree or tombstone or anywhere in
12242,PART I.,the grass; and it was not until a second voice came to his aid that
12243,PART I.,"he ran in the right direction. The second voice was loud and angry,"
12244,PART I.,and provoked the first to shriller efforts. Puppies at war! Now Billy
12245,PART I.,"was doubly anxious to find them, for he could see the fun as well as"
12246,PART I.,support the under dog. He had decided by this time that they were near
12247,PART I.,the fence which separated the graveyard from the barley field; and
12248,PART I.,"as he ran thither a third cry broke upon his ears, then a fourth, a"
12249,PART I.,fifth--till voices innumerable seemed to join the chorus.
12250,PART I.,
12251,PART I.,"“A dozen, as I’m alive!” said Billy; and by this time he had an"
12252,PART I.,"opportunity to count them, though it was by no means easy to count all"
12253,PART I.,"the big heads and little feet which he found struggling, pushing and"
12254,PART I.,climbing in the old tin pan between the fence and a walnut tree. He
12255,PART I.,"bent above the moving mass, and after various attempts learned that"
12256,PART I.,"their number was seven. In regard to eyes, total blindness indicated"
12257,PART I.,"extreme youth. And as to the cause of their complaint, it was evident"
12258,PART I.,"that they had been abandoned in their ignorance and helplessness, and"
12259,PART I.,were in need of food.
12260,PART I.,
12261,PART I.,Billy gazed into the pan with emotions of pride and compassion; the
12262,PART I.,pride of a discoverer and possessor; the compassion of a heart always
12263,PART I.,"sensitive to canine grief, but moved to its depths by this spectacle of"
12264,PART I.,blind and orphaned infant woe. Seven little wails proceeding from seven
12265,PART I.,"hungry mouths, fourteen little paws groping and struggling towards"
12266,PART I.,escape from suffering whose cause was hardly comprehended--the sight
12267,PART I.,might rouse a stouter heart than Billy’s.
12268,PART I.,
12269,PART I.,"“They’re a prize,” thought he, viewing the enormous heads and wee paws,"
12270,PART I.,"critically. “They look like rare ones--Irish setters, perhaps. Bob"
12271,PART I.,would know. He’s up on those things.”
12272,PART I.,
12273,PART I.,Bob might also make some helpful suggestions in regard to the puppies’
12274,PART I.,future; for Billy could not take them home; he could not leave them to
12275,PART I.,"starve, and he was far from willing to distribute among his friends"
12276,PART I.,"the orphans whom he had rescued from untimely graves, and towards whom"
12277,PART I.,his heart was beating with such tender interest.
12278,PART I.,
12279,PART I.,"In his dilemma he left the puppies, to consult with Bob; and as he ran"
12280,PART I.,"away, looked in vain for the mother dog."
12281,PART I.,
12282,PART I.,"“It would never do to let them starve,” said Bob; “but we must give"
12283,PART I.,the mother a fair chance. If she isn’t back by seven we can conclude
12284,PART I.,"they’re abandoned, and they shall have a home in my barn, for the"
12285,PART I.,present.”
12286,PART I.,
12287,PART I.,"Having met at seven, Bob and Billy hastened to the graveyard. No mother"
12288,PART I.,"dog could be seen as they approached the stile, and a chorus of loud"
12289,PART I.,wails informed them that she had not returned. They were soon kneeling
12290,PART I.,"by the pan, criticising forms and faces; at the same time observing"
12291,PART I.,with deepest pity how the little mouths told their misery and the weary
12292,PART I.,paws strove to escape from it.
12293,PART I.,
12294,PART I.,[Illustration: BILLY EXPERIENCES UNSPEAKABLE HAPPINESS.]
12295,PART I.,
12296,PART I.,"“I should judge you were a pointer by your nose,” said Bob, addressing"
12297,PART I.,the only puppy who could be said to have an attempt at the feature.
12298,PART I.,"“This may be a Newfoundland,” referring to one whose nose they would"
12299,PART I.,not have discovered but for the end of a wee pair of nostrils. “They’re
12300,PART I.,"a splendid lot, poor babies! It’s a clear case of desertion, Billy. We"
12301,PART I.,mustn’t leave them here without food another moment.”
12302,PART I.,
12303,PART I.,Billy lifted the rusty old pan and clasped it tenderly against his
12304,PART I.,"jacket. Then they stepped briskly towards the stile, for the graveyard"
12305,PART I.,was by no means the tempting place it had been two hours ago.
12306,PART I.,
12307,PART I.,"“Keep an eye out for my father,” said Billy. “They make such a noise"
12308,PART I.,they may get us into trouble.”
12309,PART I.,
12310,PART I.,"But by sometimes crossing streets and turning corners suddenly,"
12311,PART I.,"sometimes running and sometimes dodging, they succeeded in reaching the"
12312,PART I.,barn without encountering friend or acquaintance who would betray them.
12313,PART I.,
12314,PART I.,“Take them in and make them at home on the hay while I go for their
12315,PART I.,"supper,” said Bob."
12316,PART I.,
12317,PART I.,At the barn door Billy and the puppies were received by no less a
12318,PART I.,"person than Timothy, the coachman, who had consented to give the"
12319,PART I.,orphans a temporary asylum. He also bent gravely and critically over
12320,PART I.,the pan; but his verdict did not agree with Bob’s.
12321,PART I.,
12322,PART I.,"“Mongrel, very mongrel,” said Timothy, shaking his head."
12323,PART I.,
12324,PART I.,The fact that they belonged to his own humble rank in life may possibly
12325,PART I.,have increased his sympathy; but it is certain that no orphaned
12326,PART I.,kittens could have roused such emotions of pity in his manly breast.
12327,PART I.,"He had a corner ready, cushioned with hay; and they were soon rubbing"
12328,PART I.,against something better adapted to their tender sides than cold tin.
12329,PART I.,"But though they nestled in the hay as if they liked it, their wails"
12330,PART I.,"continued, and they soon began to toddle about in search of food. When"
12331,PART I.,"Bob came bringing it, however, Timothy shook his head and said:"
12332,PART I.,
12333,PART I.,"“Ten chances to one against touching a drop, Billy. I’ve known ’em to"
12334,PART I.,die rather than drink it out of a saucer at that age.”
12335,PART I.,
12336,PART I.,"A vision of seven little puppies wailing and toddling to their doom,"
12337,PART I.,"of seven cold, stiff forms, seven green graves in a row, clouded"
12338,PART I.,"Billy’s fancy for a moment. But no, he would not accept such dark"
12339,PART I.,possibilities. The puppies must be tenderly persuaded what was for
12340,PART I.,their good; and canine reason must triumph over mere brute prejudice.
12341,PART I.,
12342,PART I.,"But, alas, for Billy’s faith in canine intelligence--no sooner were"
12343,PART I.,the little noses introduced to the saucer than wails broke forth with
12344,PART I.,tenfold energy. One after another they struggled from his hands and
12345,PART I.,"toddled away, until the seventh sat afar in the hay, with milky nose"
12346,PART I.,and empty stomach protesting against the insult it had received.
12347,PART I.,
12348,PART I.,Billy was sorely tried and disappointed; but he considered their youth
12349,PART I.,and blindness; he reflected that even human intelligence fears what it
12350,PART I.,"cannot see, and that it becomes one to have much patience with blind"
12351,PART I.,"puppy babies. So he captured them again, individually, and repeated the"
12352,PART I.,"process several times, until each, in spite of kicks and screams, had"
12353,PART I.,been compelled to sniff or lap up a few drops. He did not rest till the
12354,PART I.,saucer was emptied; and by that time Timothy thought they had probably
12355,PART I.,"taken enough to preserve life through the night, though not enough to"
12356,PART I.,make them comfortable and hush their wails.
12357,PART I.,
12358,PART I.,"Billy went home with the wails still in his ears. You may be sure,"
12359,PART I.,"however, that it was not of seven weak, blind, crying infants that he"
12360,PART I.,"dreamed; but of seven gallant hounds full-statured, noses cold and keen"
12361,PART I.,"of scent, heads erect and proud--for faith and hope are brave at the"
12362,PART I.,age of twelve.
12363,PART I.,
12364,PART I.,"But like other dreams which faith and hope have dreamed at night,"
12365,PART I.,Billy’s fled at dawn. One-seventh of it at least could never come
12366,PART I.,true. One-seventh of it was found stiff and still in the hay; and was
12367,PART I.,speedily borne to a lonely little grave beneath the apple tree.
12368,PART I.,
12369,PART I.,"“What did I tell you?” said Timothy. “They’ll all be dead afore night,"
12370,PART I.,"sooner’n drink from a saucer. You’d best drown ’em, Billy, and put ’em"
12371,PART I.,out o’ misery.”
12372,PART I.,
12373,PART I.,But Billy vowed he would never drown them; that he wouldn’t hesitate
12374,PART I.,if they were kittens; but he’d as soon drown a baby as a puppy. He
12375,PART I.,was going to raise the six! No pains should be spared to rear a round
12376,PART I.,half-dozen. Number Seven was the obstinate member of the family anyway.
12377,PART I.,Billy knew him by the spot on his right ear; and didn’t he remember how
12378,PART I.,much harder he kicked than the other six last night? Drown them! Never!
12379,PART I.,
12380,PART I.,"An expression, not of disappointment, might have been observed on"
12381,PART I.,"Timothy’s face; although he shook his head, saying:"
12382,PART I.,
12383,PART I.,"“Mongrel, very mongrel, Billy. It’s my advice to drown ’em.”"
12384,PART I.,
12385,PART I.,"That head shook frequently during the day; indeed, whenever Timothy"
12386,PART I.,appeared in the barn door to see how Bob and Billy were succeeding.
12387,PART I.,They were not to be discouraged by head-shakings; but were rather
12388,PART I.,"provoked to greater efforts, as perhaps, Timothy intended. Hopes"
12389,PART I.,"prevailed over fears until evening, when it became only too evident"
12390,PART I.,that a pair of the puppies toddled more and more feebly as the shadows
12391,PART I.,"fell. Applications of milk to their nostrils, force, and even mild"
12392,PART I.,"persuasion, so annoyed them that it seemed true kindness to let them"
12393,PART I.,depart in peace. They were allowed therefore to toddle into a secluded
12394,PART I.,"corner, where they lay down together, and from which they toddled out"
12395,PART I.,no more.
12396,PART I.,
12397,PART I.,"“It’s better so,” said Timothy. “They ain’t got nothing to go a-huntin’"
12398,PART I.,"and cryin’ for now. If they ain’t found what they wanted by this time,"
12399,PART I.,they don’t know the difference.”
12400,PART I.,
12401,PART I.,"It was said with quite a softening of Timothy’s big voice, as he gently"
12402,PART I.,"lifted them for the burial. Billy and Bob sat apart, silent and abject,"
12403,PART I.,their hands in their pockets and scowls upon their brows. But they rose
12404,PART I.,"and followed Timothy as he advanced to the cemetery, bearing a puppy in"
12405,PART I.,"each hand. Few remarks were made until they were returning to the barn,"
12406,PART I.,when Bob said:
12407,PART I.,
12408,PART I.,"“Brace up, Billy. Four’s a better number than seven. You would"
12409,PART I.,have found seven a big family on your hands. I’ve always noticed a
12410,PART I.,difference in their constitutions. Those two never had as much strength
12411,PART I.,as the others.”
12412,PART I.,
12413,PART I.,"“Do you think the others will come on?” Billy asked, timidly."
12414,PART I.,
12415,PART I.,"“I do,” said Bob. “They’re robust compared to the others; and they’ve"
12416,PART I.,eaten quite a lot to-day. I shouldn’t wonder if their eyes would be
12417,PART I.,open by morning.”
12418,PART I.,
12419,PART I.,"Billy was only too glad to hope again, and went home to dream of a"
12420,PART I.,"gallant quartette, in spite of Timothy’s parting words:"
12421,PART I.,
12422,PART I.,"“Very mongrel, Billy, and no constitution. The sooner you put an end to"
12423,PART I.,"’em, the better for all parties.”"
12424,PART I.,
12425,PART I.,"Timothy having spoken, went immediately to the kitchen, where he"
12426,PART I.,"confided to cook the whole tragic tale, and said he had heard how"
12427,PART I.,oatmeal porridge was nourishing for young puppies; “and suppose you
12428,PART I.,"make us a little, Eliza, with not too much oatmeal and a plenty of"
12429,PART I.,"milk, so ’s ’t’ll go down easy.”"
12430,PART I.,
12431,PART I.,"Later, Timothy might have been seen, by the light of a lantern,"
12432,PART I.,"kneeling upon the hay, feeding the puppies porridge, which he promised"
12433,PART I.,"would give them “sound sleep with something on their stomachs,” and"
12434,PART I.,save them perhaps from being dead puppies in the morning.
12435,PART I.,
12436,PART I.,"Although Billy dreamed his brave dreams of an unbroken quartette, still"
12437,PART I.,he stepped into the barn with some anxiety the next morning. But the
12438,PART I.,oatmeal porridge had proved popular; the puppies took it with little
12439,PART I.,"urging, and even learned to smell their way into its neighborhood. It"
12440,PART I.,did not make them strong and sprightly; it did not open their eyes;
12441,PART I.,"but it kept them from dying, and surely this was not a small thing to"
12442,PART I.,accomplish. The very fact that three days went by and no death occurred
12443,PART I.,"in the family, encouraged them all to hope that a stronger tide of life"
12444,PART I.,"would soon set in, forcing eyes open and making legs frisky. But when"
12445,PART I.,"three other days had dragged along, Timothy, in a moment of impatience"
12446,PART I.,declared that their eyes would never open.
12447,PART I.,
12448,PART I.,"“A blind dog is sure no good,” said he; “and mongrel as they are,"
12449,PART I.,"you’ll drop ’em in the river, if you take my advice, Billy.”"
12450,PART I.,
12451,PART I.,[Illustration: NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE MONGREL.]
12452,PART I.,
12453,PART I.,Nevertheless he went to Eliza and said: “Why not try a little juice of
12454,PART I.,"the beef? Meat, as all know, is the food for grown dogs. Why not the"
12455,PART I.,juice of the meat for young dogs without teeth to chew the solid? I’ll
12456,PART I.,"step around to the butcher’s, Eliza.”"
12457,PART I.,
12458,PART I.,He returned from the butcher’s with a pound of chopped beef. Eliza put
12459,PART I.,the water to it; and early the next morning Timothy might again have
12460,PART I.,been seen kneeling on the hay. He endeavored to persuade the puppies
12461,PART I.,that his cup had invigorating properties and a cure for blindness; and
12462,PART I.,"urged them as they loved life and desired to view the face of nature,"
12463,PART I.,"to partake. But, alas, once more for canine reason! One after another"
12464,PART I.,"they sniffed, spit, sputtered, wailed and retreated."
12465,PART I.,
12466,PART I.,"“You’re a mongrel, brutish set,” said Timothy, in righteous"
12467,PART I.,indignation; “and I’ll be blowed if you’re worth saving!”
12468,PART I.,
12469,PART I.,"But before he could leave them to their fate, either his words, or a"
12470,PART I.,"sudden instinct of self-preservation, turned one of the retreating"
12471,PART I.,puppies straight about. Timothy was not inclined to offer any
12472,PART I.,assistance and run the risk of another disappointment. But when it
12473,PART I.,became evident that the puppy was trying to smell his way to the
12474,PART I.,"beef-tea, he put the cup under his nose, and was rewarded by seeing a"
12475,PART I.,small pink tongue come out for a taste. One taste led to another and
12476,PART I.,"another, until the little fellow had breakfasted bravely, and Timothy"
12477,PART I.,was so rejoiced that he tried the obstinate three again. But his
12478,PART I.,"efforts were vain; and he fastened all his hopes on the good puppy,"
12479,PART I.,whose conduct he hastened to report to Bob and Billy.
12480,PART I.,
12481,PART I.,[Illustration: THE BEEF-TEA PREVAILS.]
12482,PART I.,
12483,PART I.,Now whether medical science will allow any direct connection between
12484,PART I.,"beef-tea and the eyes, we do not know, but it is certain that when"
12485,PART I.,Billy entered the barn two hours later he was startled by a bright
12486,PART I.,gaze. If a pair of stars had fallen from the sky to gaze at him out
12487,PART I.,"of that corner, he could hardly have been more amazed than to discover"
12488,PART I.,that the bright objects were the eyes of a dog--of his little dog.
12489,PART I.,
12490,PART I.,“Bob! Timothy!” he screamed. But before they could arrive he had
12491,PART I.,bounded towards the puppy and lifted him up. Seated upon Billy’s hands
12492,PART I.,he held his head erect and looked at his master with (the foolish
12493,PART I.,master fancied) affectionate recognition.
12494,PART I.,
12495,PART I.,"“It’s the beef-tea!” said Timothy, who had by this time arrived."
12496,PART I.,
12497,PART I.,"“And thanks to you, old friend,” said Billy. “He’ll live now, Tim. Do"
12498,PART I.,you s’pose he’d change the world that’s to be taken a good look at for
12499,PART I.,a hole in the ground? Not he!”
12500,PART I.,
12501,PART I.,“You’re right!” said Timothy. “We must make these blind fellows take
12502,PART I.,some of the eye-opener and get a look at the world before it’s too
12503,PART I.,late.”
12504,PART I.,
12505,PART I.,They were all so encouraged by that pair of bright eyes that they
12506,PART I.,labored patiently with the three blind brothers; but though they still
12507,PART I.,"partook of oatmeal porridge freely, they could never be induced to"
12508,PART I.,imbibe more than an occasional drop of beef-tea; and instead of waxing
12509,PART I.,"fat and active on oatmeal, they waned daily."
12510,PART I.,
12511,PART I.,All the love which Billy had divided among seven was given to the
12512,PART I.,quartette; and so a greater portion was blighted when the next puppy
12513,PART I.,died.
12514,PART I.,
12515,PART I.,"“It makes me think of the ‘ten little Injuns,’ the way they drop off"
12516,PART I.,"one after another,” said Billy, as they laid him away from the sunshine"
12517,PART I.,which he had never seen.
12518,PART I.,
12519,PART I.,So the love of four fell to three; and though Billy was very proud
12520,PART I.,"of the puppy who ate beef-tea, who was learning to walk firmly and"
12521,PART I.,"briskly, he was equally as tender of the less fortunate brothers. It is"
12522,PART I.,true that on entering the barn one morning he forgot them for a moment
12523,PART I.,"as the other trotted towards him and laid--yes, actually rubbed!--his"
12524,PART I.,"nose in his hand. But he recovered from the glad surprise directly, and"
12525,PART I.,"looked over at the bed in the corner. Still asleep, the lazy fellows!"
12526,PART I.,"He tossed some hay at them, which caused a languid paw to appear; then"
12527,PART I.,"a head stirred, and another until the little soft heap had shaken"
12528,PART I.,"itself apart and separated into two puppies, who faced about and looked"
12529,PART I.,"at each other. Yes, for the first and last time, they celebrated their"
12530,PART I.,awakening after the usual fashion of opening the eyes.
12531,PART I.,
12532,PART I.,“Hurrah!” shouted Billy.

12552,PART II.,"But it was his last hurrah; for puppies, like people, view the world"
12553,PART II.,"through their own eyes, and where their brother had seen, approved, and"
12554,PART II.,"desired, they gazed quite indifferently. Bob and Billy carried them"
12555,PART II.,out-doors for a broader view of life; but could not persuade them that
12556,PART II.,sunshine and verdure were more to be desired than two snug little beds
12557,PART II.,"underground. Better death, with no good Puppy-land to go to; better"
12558,PART II.,"an end of all things, than life with its ups and downs, its roses and"
12559,PART II.,"thorns, the uncertain joys and certain ills that puppy flesh is heir"
12560,PART II.,to--such seemed their reflections as they gazed upon the world with
12561,PART II.,"languid, melancholy eyes. They shunned their brother’s gay society;"
12562,PART II.,they refused food and wailed with hunger; they partook of a little and
12563,PART II.,"wailed with pain; one died in the evening, yawning and stretching; the"
12564,PART II.,"other in the morning, kicking and squealing; two new graves were dug"
12565,PART II.,under the apple-tree: and one puppy fell heir to the love of six.
12566,PART II.,
12567,PART II.,"“I wouldn’t care so much if they hadn’t opened their eyes,” said Billy;"
12568,PART II.,"“but I thought they were sure to live then. It’s discouraging, I"
12569,PART II.,"declare; I’m afraid it’s going to end like the ten little Injuns, ‘And"
12570,PART II.,then there were none.’”
12571,PART II.,
12572,PART II.,"“No, it won’t,” said Bob. “We’ll raise this fellow.”"
12573,PART II.,
12574,PART II.,"“Yes,” said Timothy, “he’s going to live.” When Timothy spoke so"
12575,PART II.,positively one could afford to hope.
12576,PART II.,
12577,PART II.,"“Do you hear?” said Billy, capturing the lively puppy, who was behaving"
12578,PART II.,"like anything but a mourner after the funeral. “We have hopes of you,"
12579,PART II.,"sir; and beware how you disappoint us. See what obstinacy has done, and"
12580,PART II.,take warning by your brothers. I advise you to make the most of all the
12581,PART II.,"life you’ll ever get, for it isn’t soul that gives you such a knowing"
12582,PART II.,look. There is nothing behind those eyes but brains; and brains die out
12583,PART II.,"as much as bodies, sir. Bob,” he exclaimed, “see him look at me. Don’t"
12584,PART II.,tell me he doesn’t understand!”
12585,PART II.,
12586,PART II.,"“I wouldn’t risk such an opinion,” said Bob. “They say that eyes"
12587,PART II.,are the windows of the mind. Now that he’s got his windows open why
12588,PART II.,shouldn’t you take looks back and forth.”
12589,PART II.,
12590,PART II.,"“Pretty good,” said Billy. “Duke has spied out the fact, somewhere,"
12591,PART II.,that I’m his master.”
12592,PART II.,
12593,PART II.,"They had named him, in contempt of Timothy, and in anticipation of the"
12594,PART II.,rank which was expected to assert itself with his growth.
12595,PART II.,
12596,PART II.,"“He certainly makes a difference between you and the rest of us,” said"
12597,PART II.,Bob.
12598,PART II.,
12599,PART II.,The difference became more marked each day. In no one’s hand did Duke
12600,PART II.,rub his little nose so often as in his master’s; no one else’s cheeks
12601,PART II.,"were licked so affectionately. It was Billy that he trotted after, and"
12602,PART II.,"squealed for, when the big gate separated them and his master’s face"
12603,PART II.,was set towards home. These signs of preference were very flattering
12604,PART II.,"to Billy, but also caused him pangs, for the fonder he became of the"
12605,PART II.,"dog, the more he feared to lose him. Although he increased rapidly in"
12606,PART II.,"bulk, strength, vivacity and intelligence, it was a long time before"
12607,PART II.,"Billy could cease to be alarmed if he appeared languid, over-slept,"
12608,PART II.,"or ate lightly. However, he developed at last into such a sturdy"
12609,PART II.,fellow that anxiety on his account was absurd. All lingering doubts as
12610,PART II.,"to his loyalty, also, came to an end, for Billy had feared that his"
12611,PART II.,best affections might be won over to the master who fed him. But Duke
12612,PART II.,"knew his own master, and did not seem disposed to inquire why he was"
12613,PART II.,banished from his table.
12614,PART II.,
12615,PART II.,[Illustration: AFTER HIS MASTER.]
12616,PART II.,
12617,PART II.,The devotion of “Bob’s dog” to Billy was a constant source of surprise
12618,PART II.,to the boys who had not heard the secret of the mastership. Wherever
12619,PART II.,"Billy went, the dog was sure to go--unless ordered to the contrary, for"
12620,PART II.,"whatever Billy ordered, the dog was sure to do. His absolute obedience,"
12621,PART II.,"rather than natural talent, made him the accomplished fellow which he"
12622,PART II.,"became. Billy’s will was his dog’s will, and so great was the patience"
12623,PART II.,of both teacher and scholar that in course of time there was hardly
12624,PART II.,"a dog in town so skilled as Duke in leaping, vaulting, fetching and"
12625,PART II.,"carrying, so at home on land and water--whether summoned to scour a"
12626,PART II.,"field, explore a bush, stem a tide, or save a boy from drowning."
12627,PART II.,
12628,PART II.,"Assured, then, of his life and loyalty, proud of his character and his"
12629,PART II.,"accomplishments, Billy had but two things to regret: that Duke was a"
12630,PART II.,plebeian and an exile.
12631,PART II.,
12632,PART II.,"He had grown to full size, and neither developed into pointer, spaniel"
12633,PART II.,"nor mastiff; into setter, Irish or English; into hound, fox, blood or"
12634,PART II.,"grey. Indeed, he had not the positive traits which would admit him into"
12635,PART II.,"any family, however humble. Duke was hopelessly “mongrel.”"
12636,PART II.,
12637,PART II.,"Considering his stubby paws, blunt nose, ungainly shape and indefinite"
12638,PART II.,"color on the one hand, and on the other his intelligence, good-humor,"
12639,PART II.,"honor and fidelity, Billy could not but learn a gradual lesson on the"
12640,PART II.,"folly of judging from appearances. Never, he reflected, was canine"
12641,PART II.,"exterior more plebeian, canine character more noble. So, though"
12642,PART II.,"something of an aristocrat by nature, radical principles slowly worked"
12643,PART II.,"in Billy’s mind, until one day, at Timothy’s suggestion that he should"
12644,PART II.,"change Duke’s name, he was prepared to answer:"
12645,PART II.,
12646,PART II.,[Illustration: HE WAS A FAMOUS VAULTER.]
12647,PART II.,
12648,PART II.,"“No, sir! I believe people ought to rank according to their actions."
12649,PART II.,"What difference does it make how you happen to look, or what family"
12650,PART II.,"you happen to be born into, if you’re a good fellow? My dog and I are"
12651,PART II.,"Americans, and we’ll stand by our principles, and take rank according"
12652,PART II.,"to the way we behave; won’t we, old fellow? I claim that he’s a duke in"
12653,PART II.,"character, Tim; and he’s handsome enough to suit me. I wouldn’t have a"
12654,PART II.,spot on him changed now.”
12655,PART II.,
12656,PART II.,"To which plebeian Timothy, with an approving smile, replied:"
12657,PART II.,
12658,PART II.,"“There’s no danger of his getting stolen, neither, Billy, for the price"
12659,PART II.,he’d fetch in market; no more’n he’ll get shot or poisoned for his bad
12660,PART II.,temper.”
12661,PART II.,
12662,PART II.,"“No great loss without some small gain,” said Billy. “I’m satisfied,"
12663,PART II.,"except for one thing, Tim.”"
12664,PART II.,
12665,PART II.,That one remaining cause of dissatisfaction Timothy appreciated. He
12666,PART II.,knew that Billy would never be contented to have the dog which he had
12667,PART II.,"saved from death, reared and educated an exile from his home; and,"
12668,PART II.,"though he and Bob would have missed Duke from their table, they made"
12669,PART II.,various plans for getting him admitted to Billy’s.
12670,PART II.,
12671,PART II.,"“I was screwing up my courage to lay the case before father,” said"
12672,PART II.,"Billy, “when out he came with something about that ugly little dog of"
12673,PART II.,Bob’s that he’d seen around our house. He warned me not to encourage
12674,PART II.,"him--but I can tell you it’s hard work to keep Duke away, though he’s"
12675,PART II.,"such an obedient fellow, and the cook never feeds him.”"
12676,PART II.,
12677,PART II.,"“Billy,” said Bob, “he’ll have to save your father’s life. That’s the"
12678,PART II.,way the enemies in books always get into favor. Can’t you have him pull
12679,PART II.,him out of the water one of these windy days?”
12680,PART II.,
12681,PART II.,"“That’s not such a bad suggestion,” said Billy; “the best you’ve made"
12682,PART II.,"yet. What do you think, Duke? Could you swim a mile and pull him"
12683,PART II.,"ashore? I believe he’s equal to it, Bob; and you know father’s always"
12684,PART II.,"tipping over. He generally rights himself, to be sure; but he may"
12685,PART II.,be glad of a little assistance some time. I’ll keep Duke trained on
12686,PART II.,"bringing logs ashore, and we’ll be on the lookout windy mornings; for"
12687,PART II.,father never misses a breeze.”
12688,PART II.,
12689,PART II.,But many a windy morning a dog and his master saw a stout gentleman set
12690,PART II.,sail in a frail bark on a crafty sea; many a morning they roamed the
12691,PART II.,"beach, practicing on drowning logs, as they watched the wind sport with"
12692,PART II.,"a distant sail; and however the sail might swell and veer, and lie over"
12693,PART II.,"toward the waves, it always came erect and stately into port, while a"
12694,PART II.,stout gentleman stepped safely ashore.
12695,PART II.,
12696,PART II.,"“The winds are against us, Duke,” said Billy. “There’s no use in"
12697,PART II.,fooling around the shore any longer. I’m going to make a bold strike
12698,PART II.,"to-day; and if father won’t listen to reason, we’ll just have to give"
12699,PART II.,it up--unless we run away and live together. What do you say to that?”
12700,PART II.,
12701,PART II.,Duke replied by a series of barks which Billy understood to signify
12702,PART II.,assent.
12703,PART II.,
12704,PART II.,"“We’ll try father first,” said Billy."
12705,PART II.,
12706,PART II.,He waited till his father was in his after-dinner mood. He followed him
12707,PART II.,"from the dining-room to the piazza, watched his chair go back on two"
12708,PART II.,"legs, his feet go up on the railing, his cigar take its place in his"
12709,PART II.,"teeth, the smoke curl and climb, the newspaper turn and turn, and still"
12710,PART II.,the courage of the boy on the steps did not rise to the occasion. It
12711,PART II.,"was not until the chair came down on four feet, and the stump of cigar"
12712,PART II.,"dropped over the railing, that Billy ventured to speak:"
12713,PART II.,
12714,PART II.,“Father!”
12715,PART II.,
12716,PART II.,"He looked so well pleased with life as he walked, portly and smiling,"
12717,PART II.,"towards his hat, that Billy thought now, if ever, he would be willing"
12718,PART II.,to please his son.
12719,PART II.,
12720,PART II.,Hats of various shapes and degrees hung upon the rack. There was the
12721,PART II.,broad-brimmed straw in which Judge Jenks appeared the country squire;
12722,PART II.,there was the little cloth cap in which he rode the waves a gallant
12723,PART II.,mariner; there was the soft felt which suited rough-and-ready moods;
12724,PART II.,"there was the second-best beaver; and there was the best beaver, known"
12725,PART II.,to Billy and his sisters as the “Pet and Pride.”
12726,PART II.,
12727,PART II.,The choice to-day fell on the “Pet and Pride.”
12728,PART II.,
12729,PART II.,“Good luck!” thought Billy. “I can get anything out of him when he’s
12730,PART II.,petting that hat.”
12731,PART II.,
12732,PART II.,"“Well, my son,” said papa, holding the hat in one hand and passing the"
12733,PART II.,"other caressingly around and around the crown, until the fur lay in"
12734,PART II.,silkiest smoothness.
12735,PART II.,
12736,PART II.,"But Billy waited until the hat was on, and papa surveyed the result"
12737,PART II.,"in the mirror. It gave him an elegant judicial aspect, and was vastly"
12738,PART II.,becoming beyond a doubt.
12739,PART II.,
12740,PART II.,"“Now’s my time,” thought Billy."
12741,PART II.,
12742,PART II.,"“Father,” said he, “I’d like to have a little talk with you--a little"
12743,PART II.,discussion on a certain subject.”
12744,PART II.,
12745,PART II.,“What is it?” said papa. “The Greenback movement? Or have you been
12746,PART II.,"catching Communism from Pat? What is it, Billy? Have you got the"
12747,PART II.,questions of the day settled for us? Which shall it be: hard or soft
12748,PART II.,"money, free-trade or the tariff?”"
12749,PART II.,
12750,PART II.,"“I’m not just up on those matters, sir,” said Billy. “It’s a different"
12751,PART II.,subject.”
12752,PART II.,
12753,PART II.,"“Well,” said papa, giving the “Pet and Pride” a parting glance, ere he"
12754,PART II.,"walked to the door, “well, Billy, what is it?”"
12755,PART II.,
12756,PART II.,"“It’s--it’s--dogs, sir,” said Billy, meekly."
12757,PART II.,
12758,PART II.,Stern and cold grew the beaming face beneath the “Pet and Pride.”
12759,PART II.,Aversion was in the tones which repeated Billy’s word “_Dogs!_”
12760,PART II.,
12761,PART II.,“And what have you to say on this subject?” inquired his father; “that
12762,PART II.,"they are faithful, trusty beasts? I tell you they are treacherous and"
12763,PART II.,villainous; that you wish to own one for no reason but that they are
12764,PART II.,odious to your father and you are determined to have your own way! I
12765,PART II.,"reply better than you deserve, and offer you once more a goat, or a"
12766,PART II.,pair of them.”
12767,PART II.,
12768,PART II.,"“Thanks. It’s a dog or nothing, sir,” said Billy."
12769,PART II.,
12770,PART II.,"“As you please,” said his father. “But understand that this subject"
12771,PART II.,"is not to come up again. Nothing could induce me to have a snarling,"
12772,PART II.,"snapping, vicious, treacherous cur on the premises; and you are never"
12773,PART II.,"to mention dogs to me again, sir.”"
12774,PART II.,
12775,PART II.,Billy stalked out of one gate and his father out of another.
12776,PART II.,
12777,PART II.,"“He has the Jenks will,” reflected his father, not without an emotion"
12778,PART II.,"of pride. “A dog or nothing, indeed!”"
12779,PART II.,
12780,PART II.,But the Jenks will did not support Billy very bravely as he walked on
12781,PART II.,"towards Bob’s; and by the time he reached the gate, anger, pride and"
12782,PART II.,"all harsh, inspiring feelings had given place to sadness. Bob told"
12783,PART II.,Timothy afterwards that he had never seen Billy so nearly “floored.” He
12784,PART II.,did not need to ask the result of his interview; but proposed that he
12785,PART II.,"should accompany him to the post-office, whither he was hastening with"
12786,PART II.,a letter.
12787,PART II.,
12788,PART II.,The wind which had lured Billy to the shore in the morning still rose
12789,PART II.,"in fitful gusts, playing tricks with all detached objects, greatly to"
12790,PART II.,the delight of Duke who ran in pursuit of every flying thing.
12791,PART II.,
12792,PART II.,Billy’s eyes followed the dog gloomily.
12793,PART II.,
12794,PART II.,“If it wasn’t for that leg of father’s that got bitten thirty years
12795,PART II.,"ago!” he said. “Speaking of angels, there goes father now. Hold on to"
12796,PART II.,"your hat, Bob.”"
12797,PART II.,
12798,PART II.,Each boy seized his hat as a sudden gust came sweeping down the street.
12799,PART II.,"But papa, who had appeared in view a block ahead of them, walked calmly"
12800,PART II.,"on, as if assured that no impertinent breeze would dare molest the “Pet"
12801,PART II.,and Pride.” He was so confident and careless that the wind could not
12802,PART II.,"resist taking him down a little, and lifting the hat whirled it about"
12803,PART II.,his head.
12804,PART II.,
12805,PART II.,"The uncovered judge put forth his hand, but the movement was too grave"
12806,PART II.,"and deliberate; the wind wished to play tag, and it takes two to play"
12807,PART II.,"at that game, so the judge must be taught how. As the deliberate hand"
12808,PART II.,"almost reached the hat, off skipped the wind with it, compelling the"
12809,PART II.,judge with a stately skip to follow. But he could be taught even
12810,PART II.,"swifter motions than those; a second time he almost reached the hat,"
12811,PART II.,"and it moved on with a hop and a whirl; while he, with something like"
12812,PART II.,"a hop and a whirl, moved after. But still the hat, so near his hand,"
12813,PART II.,was not in it. His indignation rose. He could not allow matters to
12814,PART II.,proceed after this unruly fashion. With a plunge he pounced on his
12815,PART II.,"property--when, lo! it lay across the ditch in the dust of the road,"
12816,PART II.,while his tormentor laughed at him!
12817,PART II.,
12818,PART II.,"But no, it was not the wind that laughed after all, though it seemed"
12819,PART II.,quite human enough to do so--the shrill tones proceeded from three
12820,PART II.,open mouths on the corner. How dare those ragged urchins lift up their
12821,PART II.,"voices in derision of a Judge of the Supreme Court! Better, perhaps,"
12822,PART II.,to lose the hat than gratify them by pursuing it. But it was his “Pet
12823,PART II.,"and Pride”--by no means an inexpensive affair; a city hat, only to be"
12824,PART II.,replaced by a day’s journey; and then he might never find such an easy
12825,PART II.,fit again.
12826,PART II.,
12827,PART II.,"After two or three somersets the hat stood still, unhurt, except for a"
12828,PART II.,"little dust. The wind fell as suddenly as it had risen, and the judge"
12829,PART II.,was enabled to recover his property without sacrificing his dignity. At
12830,PART II.,least so he flattered himself as he walked at his usual gait over the
12831,PART II.,"ditch, into the road. He had not calculated on another gust; and when"
12832,PART II.,"the hat was actually snatched almost out of his grasp again, rather"
12833,PART II.,than become the sport of those rascals on the corner he decided to let
12834,PART II.,"it go, and run the risk of getting it at the next ebb of the wind."
12835,PART II.,
12836,PART II.,"He was turning away when he happened to see near the corner a big,"
12837,PART II.,"black mud-puddle, lying in wait for unwary victims of the wind. If the"
12838,PART II.,wind and water had conspired to tease him they could not have succeeded
12839,PART II.,"better. While the hat was blown directly towards the puddle, the water"
12840,PART II.,was at the same time lashed upward to show him how black and muddy it
12841,PART II.,"was, how totally destructive to hats."
12842,PART II.,
12843,PART II.,He felt tempted to pursue the “Pet and Pride” at a flying gait; but as
12844,PART II.,"he paused to consider the boys on the corner, the mud-puddle lost its"
12845,PART II.,terrors in a new object which appeared upon the scene. This was nothing
12846,PART II.,less than a dog that came galloping after the hat with almost the speed
12847,PART II.,of the wind. Better that the “Pet and Pride” should be drowned in the
12848,PART II.,"muddiest depths than become a puppy’s plaything, thought the judge. It"
12849,PART II.,was too late for him to rescue it by this time. The hat was doomed to
12850,PART II.,"the dog or the water--the water he sincerely hoped, as he prepared to"
12851,PART II.,seek the nearest store where a covering for his head could be found.
12852,PART II.,
12853,PART II.,But as he was turning away he observed that the chances were in the
12854,PART II.,dog’s favor. It was wonderful to see those four little paws fly over
12855,PART II.,"the ground. They were gaining on the wind, no doubt about it. Gaining,"
12856,PART II.,gaining--till the race was so close that one must wait a moment and see
12857,PART II.,"it out. “Ah, the rascal has it! No, you little scamp, you’re beaten!"
12858,PART II.,"You didn’t count on that gust, sir!”"
12859,PART II.,
12860,PART II.,"But as the judge so soliloquized, a familiar voice behind him shouted,"
12861,PART II.,"“Fly, Duke, fly!” With a leap those four winged feet overtook the"
12862,PART II.,"gust; and there stood the dog at the edge of the mud-puddle, carefully"
12863,PART II.,holding the “Pet and Pride” in his teeth.
12864,PART II.,
12865,PART II.,The judge recognized that “ugly little dog of Bob’s” at the same time
12866,PART II.,that he recognized his son’s voice; and presently he discovered that
12867,PART II.,"the race had been run not for his torment, nor for mere amusement, but"
12868,PART II.,for the purpose of rescuing and restoring his property.
12869,PART II.,
12870,PART II.,"“Well, well,” said the judge, as Duke trotted up and presented the hat"
12871,PART II.,"to him; “well, well, Bob, you’ve a fine dog, sir; a gentlemanly fellow,"
12872,PART II.,"upon my word. You’ve trained him well, Bob. He does you credit, he does"
12873,PART II.,indeed.”
12874,PART II.,
12875,PART II.,"Bob rapped Billy with his elbow, as much as to say, “Here’s your golden"
12876,PART II.,opportunity; speak up!”
12877,PART II.,
12878,PART II.,"“He’s mine, sir,” Billy blurted out."
12879,PART II.,
12880,PART II.,"“_Yours!_” said the judge, removing his hand from the canine head he"
12881,PART II.,was actually condescending to pat; “_yours!_”
12882,PART II.,
12883,PART II.,Encouraged by another rap Billy continued:
12884,PART II.,
12885,PART II.,"“You can’t say that he’s ever given you any trouble, father. He’s never"
12886,PART II.,eaten a mouthful at home.”
12887,PART II.,
12888,PART II.,"“What do you think of such deception, sir?” said his father. “Do you"
12889,PART II.,mean to tell me that you have been boarding him out?”
12890,PART II.,
12891,PART II.,"“No, sir; he lives on charity. Bob supports him.”"
12892,PART II.,
12893,PART II.,"“Charity!” said his father. “What do you mean, sir?”"
12894,PART II.,
12895,PART II.,"But as he dusted the “Pet and Pride,” caressing it as of old, he took"
12896,PART II.,"a kindly peep at the little head by his knee, and gave it one more pat"
12897,PART II.,before moving away.
12898,PART II.,
12899,PART II.,"“You’re all right, old boy,” said Bob. “You’ve had your chance; that"
12900,PART II.,"wind did you a good turn, after all. It doesn’t sound quite so fine to"
12901,PART II.,"say Duke saved his hat as his life, but it amounts to the same in the"
12902,PART II.,"end. Just keep cool, Billy, and you’re all right.”"
12903,PART II.,
12904,PART II.,"It was not very easy to keep cool, however. Billy hoped and watched and"
12905,PART II.,waited a whole day before the subject of dogs was mentioned again.
12906,PART II.,
12907,PART II.,"“Where did you get him?” asked his father, as the smoke began to curl"
12908,PART II.,from his after-dinner cigar.
12909,PART II.,
12910,PART II.,"“Him?” said Billy, confusedly. “Oh, Duke? I found him in the graveyard,"
12911,PART II.,"with six more. The mother had left them, and I couldn’t let them"
12912,PART II.,"die--though the rest did, after all. But we succeeded in raising Duke;"
12913,PART II.,"and I couldn’t part with him after all that, sir.”"
12914,PART II.,
12915,PART II.,"“Don’t attempt to excuse your obstinacy,” said his father, inwardly"
12916,PART II.,"commenting on “that Jenks will.” “He’s a trained animal, I see. That is"
12917,PART II.,where the time has gone which should have been devoted to Latin. A very
12918,PART II.,"bad report that last, sir. Is he anything of a mouser?”"
12919,PART II.,
12920,PART II.,“Splendid!” said Billy.
12921,PART II.,
12922,PART II.,"Nothing more was said until the “Pet and Pride,” after the usual amount"
12923,PART II.,"of caressing, was surveyed in the mirror--then tender memories prompted"
12924,PART II.,"papa to say, gruffly:"
12925,PART II.,
12926,PART II.,“He is not to live on charity like a beggar. Shut him up in the
12927,PART II.,"store-room, if he’s good for anything, and let him have it out with the"
12928,PART II.,"rats. But keep him away from me, sir. Let him be fed in the basement,"
12929,PART II.,but let him understand that he is not to come above ground where I can
12930,PART II.,see him; and remember that he is on trial--distinctly on trial.”
12931,PART II.,
12932,PART II.,[Illustration: WITH DUKE’S COMPLIMENTS.]
12933,PART II.,
12934,PART II.,"The glad news was at once conveyed to Duke, Bob and Timothy; and Billy"
12935,PART II.,"was a happy boy--for a few days. Like other mortals of whom we hear,"
12936,PART II.,having gained much he wished to gain more. He was not satisfied that
12937,PART II.,Duke had conquered the rats and won the servants’ affections. He wished
12938,PART II.,his higher accomplishments to shine in higher circles. He wanted his
12939,PART II.,dog admitted to the full privileges of citizenship. He longed to
12940,PART II.,"introduce him to his own room on the second floor, and he found stern"
12941,PART II.,discipline necessary to keep him from the first floor.
12942,PART II.,
12943,PART II.,"Having investigated the kitchen, Duke felt a natural curiosity as to"
12944,PART II.,"the parlor, and he was often caught on the top stair, peeping into the"
12945,PART II.,"hall. Billy’s sisters called him up, but could not make him disobey his"
12946,PART II.,"master. However he might stretch his neck, wag, cry and peer wistfully,"
12947,PART II.,he could not be tempted to put a paw on the hall floor.
12948,PART II.,
12949,PART II.,"“Where did he learn obedience?” said the judge one day, after observing"
12950,PART II.,his daughters’ vain attempts. “Certainly not of his master. But perhaps
12951,PART II.,"you know the secret, Billy, and can give it to me to try on my son. I"
12952,PART II.,should like to see if there’s anything to be done with that will of
12953,PART II.,his.”
12954,PART II.,
12955,PART II.,"“Duke has never had any teacher but me, sir,” said Billy. “Shall I"
12956,PART II.,forbid his coming on the stairs?”
12957,PART II.,
12958,PART II.,"“Come up here,” said the judge, snapping his fingers towards Duke."
12959,PART II.,“Let’s see what you think of this hall before we send you down.”
12960,PART II.,
12961,PART II.,But to his surprise the dog did not obey.
12962,PART II.,
12963,PART II.,"“Come!” said Billy; and at the word he leaped toward his master,"
12964,PART II.,then looked about for some means of expressing gratitude. Spying a
12965,PART II.,"newspaper, and newspapers and elderly gentlemen being associated in his"
12966,PART II.,"mind, he fetched it and presented it to the judge. The next noon he was"
12967,PART II.,summoned again. By that time he had discovered that the newspaper was
12968,PART II.,"taken with the cigar, and no sooner saw the one produced than he ran"
12969,PART II.,in search of the other. After a few days it happened that the judge
12970,PART II.,dropped all responsibility in regard to his paper. He took his cigar
12971,PART II.,"and sat down, assured that wherever the paper might be, to what remote"
12972,PART II.,corner of the house any careless member of the family might have taken
12973,PART II.,"it, that knowing little dog would find it for him."
12974,PART II.,
12975,PART II.,[Illustration: THE CIRCUS.]
12976,PART II.,
12977,PART II.,"Having proved that he was a useful member of society, Billy wished Duke"
12978,PART II.,"to display his higher accomplishments, and one day introduced to the"
12979,PART II.,dining-room what was known down-stairs as the Circus. Judge Jenks was
12980,PART II.,"greatly entertained, and the next day undertook to be circus-manager"
12981,PART II.,himself. He succeeded so well that it became an after-dinner custom for
12982,PART II.,"Duke to speak, leap and dance at his bidding. It was funny to see the"
12983,PART II.,"portly gentleman whistling sprightly airs, with the greatest gravity"
12984,PART II.,"of countenance, while the little dog, with countenance as grave, spun"
12985,PART II.,"around on two feet, wholly intent upon keeping time to the tune. He"
12986,PART II.,"would become a lion, monkey, or squirrel at command, but the last was"
12987,PART II.,"his favorite character, as it involved nuts, which he must sit upright"
12988,PART II.,and nibble. After his fondness for almonds was discovered Billy noticed
12989,PART II.,that they were seldom missing from dessert without being called for.
12990,PART II.,By many little indications he was persuaded that Duke’s merits had
12991,PART II.,"overcome his father’s prejudices. But after all Duke was only a dog,"
12992,PART II.,with faults as well as virtues; and while he was still on trial Billy
12993,PART II.,could not help fearing that some mischievous prank might end the trial
12994,PART II.,"unfavorably. He waited many days, hoping that his father would declare"
12995,PART II.,the probation ended; but at last there came a day when Duke gave a
12996,PART II.,table-cloth a shaking which brought the judge’s favorite meerschaum
12997,PART II.,pipe to ruin. Billy considered the misfortune fatal.
12998,PART II.,
12999,PART II.,[Illustration: NOTHING COULD BE WORSE THAN THIS.]
13000,PART II.,
13001,PART II.,"“It’s come at last. All’s up with us,” he thought, as he administered"
13002,PART II.,the punishment customary for such offences. But what was his surprise
13003,PART II.,"to hear his father say, sternly:"
13004,PART II.,
13005,PART II.,"“That will do; that will do, sir! Who left the pipe on the table? You"
13006,PART II.,had better find out and save some of your blows for the chief offender.
13007,PART II.,How would you fare if I should deal out justice to you at that rate?
13008,PART II.,"Dogs will be dogs, sir; and Duke’s none the worse for an occasional"
13009,PART II.,overflow of spirits.”
13010,PART II.,
13011,PART II.,"“Thank you, father, for defending my dog,” said Billy, warmly. “I was"
13012,PART II.,afraid it might end in my having to part with him.”
13013,PART II.,
13014,PART II.,“Part with him?” said his father. “A very good suggestion. The best
13015,PART II.,thing you can do. I advise you to part with him by all means. I should
13016,PART II.,recommend an elderly gentleman who has learned to temper justice with
13017,PART II.,"mercy; one who needs a cheerful, young companion, competent and"

13357,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"not to get their food, or defend themselves against their natural"
13358,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"enemies, as bears do, but for the _pleasure_ of killing. Besides they"
13359,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"kill each other; and that, you know, bears very seldom do.”"

13361,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"“But we kill lambs and calves, mamma dear,” said one little bear,"

13363,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,
13364,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"“That was for your natural food,” said Mamma Bear, beaming upon him"
13365,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"fondly. “The most intelligent animals are those which, like bears, eat"
13366,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,both meat and vegetables. Men are _almost_ as intelligent as we are;

13373,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"“Let boys delight to scold and fight,"
13374,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,For ’tis their nature to;
13375,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,Let naughty children scratch and bite--
13376,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,All human beings do.

13379,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,Your angry passions rise;
13380,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,Your little paws were never made
13381,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,To tear each other’s eyes.”
13382,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,
13383,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"When the little bears could recite this perfectly, they went to sleep"
13384,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"with their paws around each other’s necks, resolving that they would"
13385,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,"never, never quarrel, for fear that they might sometime get to be as"
13386,BY KATE LAWRENCE.,bad as boys and girls; and their mamma could not but feel grateful that

13394,JACK HORNER.,
13395,JACK HORNER.,Almost every child has been early taught to repeat the lines:
13396,JACK HORNER.,
13397,JACK HORNER.,“Little Jack Horner
13398,JACK HORNER.,"Sat in the corner,"
13399,JACK HORNER.,Eating a Christmas pie;
13400,JACK HORNER.,"He put in his thumb,"
13401,JACK HORNER.,"And pulled out a plum,"
13402,JACK HORNER.,"And said, ‘What a brave boy am I!’”"
13403,JACK HORNER.,
13404,JACK HORNER.,"And Jack has generally been regarded as a nice, fat little boy, who,"
13405,JACK HORNER.,"having pleased his mother by his good conduct, has been rewarded by a"
13406,JACK HORNER.,pie of his own. And we have thought of him as sitting quietly in the
13407,JACK HORNER.,"chimney-corner, enjoying his pie; and when he pulled out that plum,"
13408,JACK HORNER.,wondering if it were full of plums.
13409,JACK HORNER.,
13410,JACK HORNER.,"But among the many “investigations” of the present day, it appears that"
13411,JACK HORNER.,"Jack Horner, though a boy, was a “defaulter” to a serious amount, and"
13412,JACK HORNER.,the plum which he pulled out of his pie cost the life of another.
13413,JACK HORNER.,
13414,JACK HORNER.,"A tradition which had its rise in the county of Somersetshire, England,"
13415,JACK HORNER.,"has at last found a place in history, and seems to be looked upon as"
13416,JACK HORNER.,reliable.
13417,JACK HORNER.,
13418,JACK HORNER.,"During the imperious reign of Henry VIII., he procured by an act of"
13419,JACK HORNER.,"Parliament the abolishment of several hundred monasteries, and a court"
13420,JACK HORNER.,"was established for the management of their revenues and their silver,"
13421,JACK HORNER.,all of which he ordered granted for his benefit.
13422,JACK HORNER.,
13423,JACK HORNER.,"When this act came in force, at the monastery at Wells it was"
13424,JACK HORNER.,"determined by the abbot that the title-deeds of the abbey estates, and"
13425,JACK HORNER.,"the valuable grange attached, should not be confiscated by the king,"
13426,JACK HORNER.,but sent to the commissioners at London.
13427,JACK HORNER.,
13428,JACK HORNER.,"The abbot, wishing for some safe method of conveying them, finally hit"
13429,JACK HORNER.,"upon this curious device. To avoid their being taken, he thought the"
13430,JACK HORNER.,"safest method would be to put them in a pie, which should be sent as a"
13431,JACK HORNER.,"present to one of the commissioners. The trustiest messenger, and one"
13432,JACK HORNER.,"little likely to excite suspicion, was a boy named Jack Horner, the son"
13433,JACK HORNER.,"of poor parents, living in the neighborhood of the monastery. He set"
13434,JACK HORNER.,out on foot carrying the pie.
13435,JACK HORNER.,
13436,JACK HORNER.,"It was a tiresome journey, and the road probably had few attractions,"
13437,JACK HORNER.,"so, selecting a comfortable corner on the wayside, Jack sat down to"
13438,JACK HORNER.,"rest. Like most boys on such occasions, he began to think of something"
13439,JACK HORNER.,"to eat; and, having no well-filled bag to go to, he thought he might"
13440,JACK HORNER.,"take a little from the inside of the pie, and it would never be missed."
13441,JACK HORNER.,
13442,JACK HORNER.,"So, “he put in his thumb,” when to his astonishment he found only"
13443,JACK HORNER.,"papers. This was poor satisfaction to the hungry lad, but he had wit"
13444,JACK HORNER.,"enough to conclude that papers sent in such a manner must be valuable,"
13445,JACK HORNER.,"so he determined to pocket one, which he did, and pursued his journey."
13446,JACK HORNER.,
13447,JACK HORNER.,"Upon delivering the pie, it was at once discovered that the chief deed"
13448,JACK HORNER.,"was missing, and, as it was thought the abbot had withheld it, an order"
13449,JACK HORNER.,"was at once sent for his execution, for not the slightest suspicion"
13450,JACK HORNER.,seems to have fallen upon Jack.
13451,JACK HORNER.,
13452,JACK HORNER.,"Years after, the paper was found in the possession of Jack’s family,"
13453,JACK HORNER.,"which, being the deed to abbey estates, was a “plum” of some value."
13454,JACK HORNER.,
13455,JACK HORNER.,1. Tell in your own words the meaning of the rhyme of “Little Jack
13456,JACK HORNER.,Horner.”

13470,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Wide awakes, you have not heard of the boy Lolly Dinks that was,"
13471,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,and is--a boy mitey in body and mighty in mind. He knows himself as
13472,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"the son and ruler of Mr. Dinks, a mild, pleasant man, who tears his"
13473,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,shirt collar in two of mornings when his slippers are in the very
13474,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"place he put them, and he can’t find them, and who sits up of nights"
13475,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"making books out of other people’s thoughts, and calls it a Literary"
13476,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Avocation! _I_ call it st--al--ng. What _I_ write comes from my own
13477,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,mind and Lolly’s.
13478,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13479,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Now, as always, the business of my life is to amuse Lolly. Lots of"
13480,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"oat-meal, beef-tea, little pills, have I taken to keep me up so that"
13481,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,I might make a successful business. For a time I supposed that I was
13482,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"teaching him; but I wasn’t, he was teaching me, and from that he went"
13483,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,on till I found he governed me. _Did_ you ever hear anything like
13484,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"this--me, Mrs. Dinks, his mother, minding Lolly Dinks? Somebody has to"
13485,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"mind me, and as Mr. Dinks will not read this, I confess I make _him_"
13486,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,mind.
13487,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13488,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"And I thought myself so clever,--that I was packing, cramming the cells"
13489,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"of Lolly’s brain with useful in-for-ma-tion, as full as the cells of"
13490,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"a bee-hive with honey. I did it at all hours, and made a nuisance of"
13491,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,myself under all circumstances. I’d go on this way: Suppose it a winter
13492,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"morning, and breakfast-time. Lolly and I are waiting for the bell to"
13493,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,ring.
13494,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13495,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Lolly,” say I, “little Jack Frost came in last night by the window"
13496,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,panes; don’t you long to hear about little Jack?” and my voice is sweet
13497,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,as a sugar lump.
13498,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13499,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“No, marmy, I want some beefsteak. I smell it;” and Lolly gives so loud"
13500,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"a sniff that I have to raise my voice, and thereby lose some of its"
13501,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,sweetness.
13502,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13503,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“It is strange so many things should have Jack tied to them,” I"

13505,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13506,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Tom Bower,” breaks in Lolly, “has a toy he calls Jack-in-a-box; nasty"
13507,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"thing, it jumps. I want my egg boiled so hard that this poker couldn’t"
13508,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"smash it,” and he gives the fender such a bang that my nerves go"
13509,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"ting-a-ling like a cracked bell,--not like poor Ophelia’s sweet bells,"
13510,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"jangled, out of tune. But duty requires me to go on, for must not my"
13511,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Lolly understand something of great Nature’s laws? With sternness I

13513,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13514,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“There is, also, Jack-a-dandy, Jack-ass, Jack-a-napes, Jack Ketch, the"

13523,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Where is that boy?” asked papa Dinks, coming from behind his newspaper."
13524,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13525,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"A moment afterward we heard him singing in the breakfast-room, “Spring,"

13529,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“The childhood,” says Milton, “shows the man, as morning shows the"

13531,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"true, what will Lolly’s bump of reverence be when he has grown to be a"
13532,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,man? Where shall a bank be found rich enough for him to draw the money
13533,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"he must have? And how many persons will be hired to find his garters,"
13534,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"his hat, his knife, his book? I never could abear Paradise Lost, and"
13535,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,I don’t wonder that the angel with the flaming sword kept Adam and
13536,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Eve out of the garden, for Adam and Eve were a poky pair, after all,"
13537,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"and could never have raised vegetables; that is, according to Milton."
13538,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"As a man, will this said Lolly domineer over his kind, and exact his"
13539,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,rights? He thinks it hard that children should not have the privilege
13540,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"of scolding parents, when the parents are so old and the children so"
13541,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"young; and why shouldn’t he contradict, when he is contradicted; he"
13542,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,knows just as well as any old Dinks knows?
13543,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13544,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Lolly is not a nice hero for a story, but what can I do? He is all the"
13545,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Lolly Dinks I have,--a “poor thing, but mine own.” And if I can’t make"
13546,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"the best of him, I must make the worst; it is “live and Dinks live”"
13547,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"with me. All is, Wide Awakes, try to help him with his poor traits;"
13548,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"that is, not make use of them on your own account."
13549,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13550,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Outside his family circle, which is compact though narrow, my Lolly"
13551,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,has the reputation of a “perfect gentleman.” Our friends and neighbors
13552,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"invite him to dinner and to lunch. Then they tell how good, how"
13553,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"refined, how sweet his manners, how gentle! And this young Dinks hears"
13554,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,it all; does he believe so? Why not? He is to these people as he
13555,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"appears; but when I try to present to their view an interior picture,"
13556,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"one I am somewhat familiar with, they return a pitying smile, and"
13557,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"believe in their hearts that I am describing _myself_, or, at any"
13558,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"rate, that I am solely to blame for all his shortcomings. I even bring"
13559,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"up absolute facts. I say, “This morning, when I offered Lolly five"
13560,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"cents, he tossed away, because I would not give him ten cents.” Or,"
13561,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Yesterday, because I refused to go on the beach in a gale of wind to"
13562,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"sail his boat, Lolly said, ‘You never do anything for me; you sit in"
13563,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"your chair and read and read, and I think you are real mean.’” This,"
13564,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"too, when I had trudged a mile into the woods with him, and lugged home"
13565,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"a pile of bushes, flowers, and grasses. It is of no use; I am in the"
13566,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"minority; they sympathize with him, not with me. I must hold my peace,"
13567,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"but I will ask myself the question, so long as I have the spirit of"
13568,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"a woman,--not Pilate’s,--whether old people or young people tell the"
13569,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"truth; but, is it the young people or the old people who lie?"
13570,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13571,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Whatever Lolly’s aspects are, life is a constant surprise and delight"
13572,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"to him. He walks daily among wonders, as Emerson says. Well, as I have"
13573,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"said before, this Master Dinks got into the habit of instructing me."
13574,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,His style was more imperative and curt than mine. Here is a sample:--
13575,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13576,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,“Do you wish to know?
13577,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Listen, Marmy."
13578,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Shall I tell you?”
13579,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13580,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Of course I have got to know. His lesson begins: “Suppose, Mrs. Marmy,"
13581,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"that the moon, being tired of her white color, should wish to borrow a"
13582,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"few yellow rays from the sun,--where would she find postage stamps to"
13583,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,get it at the sun post office?”
13584,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13585,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"This terrible conundrum floors me, and I sit dismayed."
13586,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13587,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,“Get ’em from the next rainbow!” he shrieks.
13588,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13589,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“My Lolly,” I reply, solemnly, “I see you understand the eternal"
13590,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,fitness of things.”
13591,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13592,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"And then in his turn he is posed, and falls back into his simple child"
13593,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"ways. He twists himself up into my lap, and rubs his head against my"
13594,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"shoulder, and says, for the hundredth time,--"
13595,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13596,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Tell me what you used to do, mother, dear.”"
13597,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13598,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,He kisses me; but I must own there is an “ancient and fish-like smell”
13599,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"about him, which comes from his fondness for catching minnows, and"
13600,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,other small deer of the sea. Still it goes for a kiss.
13601,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13602,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,A short tale follows.
13603,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13604,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Cola Meggs and Sailor Studd were two dogs, whose acquaintance I made"
13605,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"in my childhood. One was mouse-colored, and the other was white, with"
13606,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"large black patches; both were large. They hated cats, they hunted"
13607,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,cats. In the underpinning of our house was a hole where the broken
13608,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,crockery was thrown. I used to crawl through this hole to get dishes
13609,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"for my family’s table; very odd-shaped dishes, kind of three-cornered"
13610,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,things they were. The cats hid in this dark place when Cola and Sailor
13611,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"were on the war-path, and made themselves very unpleasant. So much so"
13612,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,that I was often obliged to sit on the doorstep while the battle raged
13613,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,between cats and dogs. Then I knew what it meant by reigning cats and
13614,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"dogs. One day I sat on the cold, cold doorstep till I grew numb, but my"
13615,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,brain was on fire. I composed a poem.
13616,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13617,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,“So Cola Meggs and Sailor Studd
13618,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Had a fight and fell in mud.
13619,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Won’t I hang them onto pegs,"
13620,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Even though they have 8 legs.”
13621,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,(The cat was killed.)
13622,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13623,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Marmy,” said Lolly, with dignity, “will you please read me Jules"
13624,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Verne’s story ‘Round the World.’”
13625,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13626,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Ah me, the mitey part of my Lolly Dinks had flown into the past, where"
13627,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,so many little children lie in the amber of a mother’s memory.
13628,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13629,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,He reminds me of the apple blossom and the apple; both are perfect in
13630,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"their way, and in the latter the nub of the blossom, from which the"
13631,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"fruit comes, remains. But this does not make me opposed to apple trees;"
13632,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"I am not like the man who said he was fond of apples, but he did not"
13633,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,approve of the cultivation of the apple tree. I am willing that they
13634,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"should grow as crooked as they like, and lay their dark arms about"
13635,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Tennyson’s fields, and his white kine glimmer as they please."
13636,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13637,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,I also made it one branch of my Dinks amusing business to print some
13638,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,of my talks with Lolly. Mr. Gill made a book for me; not the Mr. Gill
13639,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"whose teeth Wordsworth has given an immortal chatter to, but a Boston"
13640,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,Gill. I thought some mothers might find a soothing syrup in the book
13641,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,for their Dinks boys. I know one little girl liked it so much that in
13642,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,reading it she fell out of bed and bumped her head dreadfully. A boy
13643,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"found it in a circulating library, but his mother carried it back the"
13644,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"next day. She could see neither rhyme nor reason in it, and the boy"
13645,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"cried, because he said he was afraid there was only one Lolly Dinks"
13646,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"mother in the world; if there was, he was sure he could be as bad as"
13647,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Lolly Dinks, too."
13648,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13649,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,What to do next about Lolly? Some wise person talks to me about the
13650,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,transition periods; meantime am I to submit to having all my moral
13651,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"corns trod upon, and to watch the growth of his incipient corns? So far"
13652,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"he has had everything, from Noah’s ark to a schooner-rigged boat, from"
13653,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,a paint box to a set of croquet. He has had all that money can buy; but
13654,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,I have a curious feeling that now he needs something that money cannot
13655,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,buy. I hope this confession will not bring down upon my weak head any
13656,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"dogmatic, cut-and-dried mamma. I am not at home to her. I have gone"
13657,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,out: business calls me yonder. Perhaps my own Lolly will tell me what
13658,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"to do next. With all his restlessness and perversity, I see how the"
13659,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"sense of beauty develops in his mind, and that somehow he begins to"
13660,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,perceive the harmony of goodness; that to be selfish gives him a kind
13661,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,of creepy shame.
13662,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13663,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"“Our Father in heaven,” he said, one day. “Where is the Mother?”"
13664,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,
13665,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"Will he see our life better, more clearly, than Mrs. Dinks, his mother,"
13666,BY ELIZABETH STODDARD.,"or Mr. Dinks, his father? We are waiting to learn."

13776,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13777,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"I know a little black-eyed boy, with tight curls all over his head. He"
13778,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,is very sweet and pleasant when things go right; but he has days when
13779,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"everything seems to go wrong, and then he is called Cross-Patch. His"
13780,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"other name is Frank. When these days come round, everybody wishes it"
13781,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,was night.
13782,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13783,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"Cross-Patch comes down to breakfast with a red nose and a snuffle, and"

13785,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13786,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"Papa hears him coming, and says, “Falling barometer, heavy showers,"

13790,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"As Cross-Patch comes into the room and bangs the door, Tom, his big"
13791,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"brother, exclaims, “Indicative mood!” and Susie, who goes to the"
13792,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"High School, laughs and says, “Objective case, and _dis_-agrees with"

13812,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13813,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"Then they all laugh, and Cross-Patch gets worse and worse. He sits"
13814,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"down at the table, and takes a baked potato; it is hot, and burns his"
13815,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"fingers; so he pushes his plate away very hard, and upsets a glass of"
13816,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"milk, and has to be sent up stairs. He puts an apple in his pocket, and"
13817,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,goes off to school without any breakfast. On the way a big bad boy
13818,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"takes the apple away from him, just as he is going to take his first"

13820,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13821,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,At school things are no better. The hardest word in the spelling lesson
13822,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"is t-h-r-o-u-g-h, _through_, and of course the teacher gives him"
13823,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"that word to spell, and he sticks in the middle of it, and can’t get"
13824,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,_through_.
13825,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13826,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"Then comes the multiplication table, and the teacher asks him “nine"
13827,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"times four,” and he answers, “sixty-three.” The crosswise has got into"
13828,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"his brain, and he keeps on saying “sixty-three” till he thinks it is"
13829,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"right; and then he is very cross when he is told to learn his lesson,"
13830,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,and stay after school to recite it.
13831,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13832,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,As he goes home he wishes he could meet the man that made the spelling
13833,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"book, and the other man that made the multiplication table, so that he"
13834,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"might knock them both down, and jump on them with all his might a long"
13835,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"time; but, as he doesn’t see them anywhere, he thinks he will play ball."
13836,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,
13837,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"He plays that the front gate is the spelling-book man, and that the"
13838,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"lantern post is the man that made the multiplication table, and he"
13839,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"sends the ball, first at one, and then at the other, with great fury."
13840,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"At last, in a very wild throw, Cross-Patch hits the multiplication"
13841,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,man--I mean the lantern post--on the head. The pieces come rattling
13842,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"down on the sidewalk, and this dreadful noise frightens away all the"
13843,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"crossness. Frank runs into the house to his mamma, and tells her how"
13844,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"sorry he is, and begs her to tell papa all about it, and gives her all"
13845,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,the money in his little savings bank to pay for the broken lantern.
13846,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,Then mamma asks him if he is sure that Cross-Patch has gone away
13847,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"entirely, and he cries a great shower of tears, and says, “Yes, mamma,"
13848,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"every inch of him!” and mamma gives Frank some supper, and puts him to"
13849,BY MRS. EMILY SHAW FARMAN.,"bed, and tells him to pray to the good angels to drive Cross-Patch very"

13871,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"The other roosters in the barn-yard talked the matter o’er,"
13872,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,The little upstart really was becoming quite a bore.
13873,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,At last a handsome game-cock volunteered to take the case;
13874,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"“It’s time,” he said, “the creature should be taught to know his"

13878,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,And hardly had these sentiments escaped the noble bird

13880,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,
13881,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,The handsome game-cock’s feathers glistened golden in the light;
13882,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"Loud cried the tiny rooster in his coat of snowy white,"

13884,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"“We’ve all a right here,” mild replied the owner of the spurs."
13885,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"Oh, then the Bantam tiptoed round: “What’s that I heard you say?"
13886,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,I’m Chanticleer Grandissimo!”--ah! in the dust he lay.
13887,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"Above him stood the game-cock like a giant in his might,"
13888,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,And round him all the other fowls rejoicing in his fright.
13889,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,
13890,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"And while he still lay, giddy, with his dainty claws in air,"
13891,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"He was forced to hear a lecture from the other, then and there;"
13892,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"And, greatly to the credit of the silly little bird,"
13893,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,He changed his manner afterward and heeded every word.
13894,BY CLARA LOUISE BURNHAM.,"“My name is Cock-a-doodle Small,” he meekly learned to say,"

13918,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"He wasn’t a pretty boy, for his nose turned up at every thing, and"
13919,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"the corners of his mouth turned down, and he was always crying for"
13920,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"something he didn’t possess. He had a tooth come once, but instead of"
13921,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"being glad that he had something to eat with, he cried all the time"
13922,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,till he got two more teeth; and even then he wasn’t satisfied and he
13923,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,had to have twenty more; such a simple boy as he was!
13924,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,
13925,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"He had nice little white dresses, but he didn’t like them and cried"
13926,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"for pants and a jacket; and when he got those he wasn’t contented, but"
13927,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,wanted some pockets! Just think what an unreasonable boy! They used to
13928,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"put him to bed at six o’clock, but a boy down town didn’t go to bed"
13929,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"till eight, so he cried to sit up till eight; and when they had let him"
13930,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"do so, was he content? Oh, no! he fussed until they had to allow him to"
13931,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,go to bed only when the rest of the folks went. Only see what a silly

13933,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,
13934,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"They always gave him bread and milk for his supper, and sometimes"
13935,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,strawberries and jelly; but he saw that his aunt had sponge cake and
13936,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"his uncle warmed-up potatoes, and he thought he must have them too, so"
13937,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,he cried into his mug and daubed his chin with jelly until they had to
13938,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,give _him_ cake and potatoes too. What a greedy boy!
13939,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,
13940,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"His father gave him a pretty boat with white sails, and a flag on top,"
13941,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"and he used to pump the sink full of water and sail the boat in it, but"
13942,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"once he saw a pond, and then he cried to go and sail his boat on that,"
13943,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,and when they took him there the pond wasn’t big enough! What could
13944,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,they do with that boy? He had a rocking-horse at Christmas and he rode
13945,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"on it as much as a week without complaining, but one day he discovered"
13946,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,that his horse wouldn’t go ahead any--only up and down--and he got mad
13947,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"at it and pulled out its tail, and then cried for a real horse that"
13948,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"would kick and go. But they couldn’t keep on giving him all he wanted,"
13949,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,this funny boy!
13950,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,
13951,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"He used to read out of a picture-book about “Jane and John,” and “the"

13953,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"long words in it which he couldn’t understand, and he teased and teased"
13954,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,until he got somebody to tell him all about it. What an absurd boy he

13957,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"Once a little lady gave him a daisy to wear in his button-hole, but he"

13959,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"was named. His father took him to an Art Exhibition, and he saw a big"
13960,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"picture of horses and men, but he couldn’t admire it quietly, but had"
13961,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,to feel of it and find out how it was done; and before he would consent
13962,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,to go home his father was obliged to buy him a paint pot and a brush;
13963,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,and he spent a whole week trying to paint a horse on one of the barn
13964,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"doors--and what a horse! and what a boy! Well, finally he was too big"
13965,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"to learn at home, (as he already knew more than anyone else in the"
13966,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"house) and they sent him away to the academy where he studied, like"
13967,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,the rest of the boys--but when he found out that there were some books
13968,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"that the other boys didn’t study, then he insisted on learning _those_"
13969,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"lessons, and he studied Turkish and Chinese and the Wealth of Nations,"
13970,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,this wise boy who was no longer contented with doing only what others
13971,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,could do!
13972,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,
13973,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"He never played base ball or cricket, or rowed on the river; these"

13975,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"preferred to walk in the woods and pull bugs to pieces, write letters"
13976,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,for the newspapers and talk in debating societies. Thus he was
13977,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"different from other boys, and that suited him--but still he didn’t"
13978,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"feel satisfied yet, this restless boy! and he never did get satisfied"
13979,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"in all his life, because it was impossible for him to be, though he"
13980,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,"became rich and was sent to Congress and even ran for the Presidency,"
13981,BY HARRIETTE R. SHATTUCK.,with six or eight other boys. And I suppose if he had been chosen

13999,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,the Po frequently relieving the sameness. The engine now shoots into
14000,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"this tunnel, now into that, either of which, from its length, the"
14001,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"inexperienced traveller might mistake for “the grand.” When, however,"
14002,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"the approach of the latter was near, there was no misjudging the signs."
14003,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,The lights overhead were newly arranged; there was a general quick-step
14004,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"on the top of the car; and, too late to draw back, we were, willing or"
14005,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"unwilling, propelled into “chaos.”"
14006,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
14007,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Entering these depths a seriousness takes possession of one similar
14008,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,to that which affects a passenger for the first time crossing the
14009,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Suspension Bridge at Niagara Falls. The air seems stupefying, and were"

14011,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,were any oxygen in the atmosphere.

14013,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Subterranean apartments were occasionally seen at the right and left.
14014,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"In one instance several persons, perhaps the mountain kings, though by"
14015,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"no means, in royal robes, appeared to be lunching. The glare of their"
14016,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"lights was dismal. These rooms, or dens, were invariably near the"

14021,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"As everything seems to be rushing to destruction, reflections are"
14022,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,a natural consequence during this ride of nearly a half hour. It
14023,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,takes but very few minutes to “retrospect” (any word is right in a
14024,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"tunnel) one’s whole life. It is surprising too, how thick and fast the"
14025,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"short-comings present themselves, especially those of childhood. Indeed"
14026,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"I did not get beyond the first dozen years of my youth, yet they were"
14027,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,countless. One of these transgressions out of which in later years I
14028,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"had had much enjoyment on the review, came to me very significantly"
14029,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,in the tunnel and I grew very sober over it. Now that I am safely at
14030,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Modane and know that I will _never_ take the route through the “Alpine
14031,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Bore” again, I transcribe a confession of the above in the form of the"
14032,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
14033,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
14034,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,STORY OF THE CLOCK.
14035,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14036,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"My real name was so short that I was called Nancy, “for long.” I"
14037,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,was the fourth child in a very large family. The three elder were a
14038,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"brother and two sisters. The first, very quick at books and figures,"
14039,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"finished his education at an early age, and seemed to me about as old"
14040,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"and dignified as my father. My sisters, Sarah and Mary, were exemplary"
14041,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"in school and out. The former, at eight, read Virgil; painted “Our"
14042,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,Mother’s Grave” at eleven--’twas an imaginary grave judging from the
14043,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"happy children standing by; wrote rhymes for all the albums, printed"
14044,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,verses on card-board and kept on living. Mary read every book she
14045,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,could find; had a prize at six years of age for digesting “Rollins’
14046,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Ancient History;” had great mathematical talent, and though she sighed"
14047,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"in her fourteenth year that she had grown old, yet continues to add to"
14048,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"her age, being one of the oldest professors in a flourishing college."
14049,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14050,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"With such precedences, it is not strange that my parents were"
14051,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,astonished when their fourth child developed other and less exaggerated
14052,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"traits, with no inclination to be moulded. Within ten months of my"
14053,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"eighth year, my teacher, who had previously dealt with Sarah and"
14054,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Mary with great success, made the following remark to me: “If thou"
14055,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"wilt learn to answer all those questions in astronomy,” passing her"
14056,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"pencil lightly over two pages in _Wilkin’s Elements_, “before next"
14057,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"seventh day, I’ll give thee two cents and a nice note to thy parents”"
14058,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"(my father was a scientific man, and my mother a prime mover in our"
14059,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,education).
14060,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14061,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"“Two cents” did seem quite a temptation, but the lesson I concluded"
14062,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,not to get. “I worked wiser than I knew.” I may have wanted a “two
14063,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"cents” many a time since, but I never was sorry about that. Spelling,"
14064,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"arithmetic, grammar, geography, history and reading, though they were"
14065,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"the Peter-Parley edition, seemed about enough food for a child that"
14066,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"was hungering and thirsting for a doll like Judith Collin’s, and for"
14067,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,capacity to outrun the neighboring boys. To be sure the recitation in
14068,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"concert, where the names of the asteroids, only four in number (instead"
14069,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"of a million and four) were brought out by some of us, as “vesper,”"
14070,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"“pallid,” “you know,” and “serious” showed that we did not confine"
14071,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,ourselves too closely to the book.
14072,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14073,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Seventh-day afternoon was a holiday, and on one of these occasions"
14074,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I was sent to stay with my grandmother, as my mother and my maiden"
14075,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,aunt (the latter lived with my grandmother) were going to Polpis
14076,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"to a corn-pudding party. I was too troublesome to be left at home,"
14077,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"therefore, two birds were to be killed with one stone."
14078,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14079,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,Now I had for a long time desired to be left alone with my lame and
14080,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"deaf grandmother and the Tall Clock, especially the Tall Clock. I went,"
14081,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"therefore, to her old house on Plover street in a calm and lovely frame"
14082,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,of mind and helped get my aunt ready for the ride.
14083,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14084,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,’Twas a cold day though September; and after she took her seat in
14085,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"the flag-chair tied into the cart, I conceived the notion to add my"
14086,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,grandmother’s best “heppy” to the wraps which they had already put
14087,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,into the calash. I always had wanted a chance at that camphor-trunk;
14088,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"and the above cloak, too nice to be worn, lay in the bottom underneath"
14089,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,a mighty weight of neatly-folded articles of winter raiment. It came
14090,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,out with a “long pull” and many a “strong pull” and I got to the door
14091,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"with the head of it, while the whole length of this precious bright"
14092,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"coating was dragging on the floor. But the cart had started, and when"
14093,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"my aunt looked back, I was flourishing this “heppy” to see the wind"
14094,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,fill it.
14095,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14096,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I returned to the room, restored the article to the chest quite snugly,"
14097,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,leaving one corner hanging out and that I stuffed in afterwards and
14098,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,jumped upon the cover of the trunk so that it shut. Very demurely I
14099,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"sat down before the open fire by my grandmother’s easy chair, rocking"
14100,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"furiously, watching my own face in the bright andirons, whose convex"
14101,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"surfaces reflected first a “small Nancy” far off, then as I rocked"
14102,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"forward, a large and distorted figure. My rapid motions made such rapid"
14103,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"caricatures that I remained absorbed and attentive. My grandmother,"
14104,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"not seeing the cause of my content, decided (as she told my mother"
14105,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"afterwards), “that the child was sick, or becoming regenerated.” Happy"
14106,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,illusion!
14107,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14108,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"At last, my grandmother got to nodding and I sprang to my"
14109,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,long-contemplated work.
14110,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14111,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Putting a cricket into one of the best rush-bottom chairs, I climbed to"
14112,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"the Clock; took off the frame, glass and all, from its head, placing"
14113,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,it noiselessly on the floor; opened the tall door in the body of the
14114,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"clock; drew out and unhung the pendulum--the striking weight, whose"
14115,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"string was broken, was made all right and put for the time being on the"
14116,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,table. Then the “moon and stars” which had been fixed for a quarter of
14117,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"a century, were made to spin; the “days of the month” refused to pass"
14118,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"in review without a squeak that must be remedied, so I flew into the"
14119,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,closet to get some sweet oil which was goose-grease; but shutting the
14120,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,closet-door I roused my grandmother.
14121,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14122,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I quietly went at the old rocking again, the bottle of goose-grease"
14123,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"in my pocket, which I feared might melt and I should lose the"
14124,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,material--the bottle was already low.
14125,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14126,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Fortunately my grandmother began napping again, and I resumed my task."
14127,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,Applying the oil with a bird’s wing was lavish process--the wheels
14128,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,moved easily; the hands became quite slippy; the moon “rose and set” to
14129,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"order; the days of the month glided thirty times a minute, and I was"
14130,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,just using a pin to prove the material of the dial when my grandmother
14131,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"turned her head, at the same time reaching for her cane (the emergency"
14132,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,had been foreseen and special care had I taken that the cane should not
14133,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,be forthcoming). “Nancy! Nancy! is thee crazy?”
14134,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14135,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"Thinking to strengthen this idea, I jumped into the clock and held the"
14136,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,door fast; but finally thinking ’twas cowardly not to face it I jumped
14137,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"out again, up into the chair, saying, “I am mending this old clock;”"
14138,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"and notwithstanding her remonstrances, continued my work putting back"
14139,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"the various pieces. When I was afraid of “giving out and giving up,”"
14140,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,I decided I would just answer her back once and say “I wont.” The
14141,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"wickedness would certainly discourage her beyond a hope, and then I"
14142,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,could finish.
14143,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14144,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"So I put the moon on, staring full; in putting on the hands I got, I"
14145,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"thought, sufficiently worked up to venture my prepared reply to her"
14146,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,repeated “get down!”
14147,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14148,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I accordingly approached my grandmother, stopping some feet from her;"
14149,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"bent my body half-over, my long red hair covering my eyes, and my head"
14150,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"suiting its action to my earnestness, and in a decided rebellious tone,"
14151,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I spelled, “I W-O-N-T;” but accidently giving myself a turn on my heel"
14152,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I fell to the floor, with the pronunciation still unexpressed."
14153,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14154,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I quickly rose, though I saw stars without any “two cents,” and"
14155,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"returned to, and finished my work. I had just put the last touch on"
14156,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,when I heard the wheels. How I dreaded my aunt’s appearance! As she
14157,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,entered the door I was found “demurely rocking” to the pictures in the
14158,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,andirons.
14159,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14160,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"My aunt thought I did not seem natural, and kissed me as being “too"
14161,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"good, perhaps, to be well.” My grandmother tried to speak, but I"
14162,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,interrupted:
14163,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14164,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"“I must go home without my tea. I am not afraid of the dark, and I"
14165,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,better go.”
14166,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14167,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"This was another proof of indisposition to the aunt. I left the house,"
14168,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"kissing as I thought, my grandmother into silence; but as I looked"
14169,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,back I saw she could not utter a word without laughing at the aunt’s
14170,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"anxiety, and so had to put off the narration till after my departure."
14171,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14172,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,I went home about as fast as possible; desired to go to bed
14173,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"immediately--never went before without being sent, and then not in a"
14174,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"very good mood. My mother followed me with a talk of “herb tea,” and as"
14175,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"I thought I must have some “end to the farce,” I agreed that a little"
14176,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"might do me good. My mother consequently brought me, I do believe, a"
14177,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"“Scripture measure” pint of bitter tea, which I hurriedly drank, as I"
14178,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"knew my sisters had already started for my grandmother’s, to see how I"
14179,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"had been through the afternoon. When they returned, though I heard the"
14180,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"laughing and talking in the sitting-room below, I was, to all intents"
14181,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"and purposes, sound asleep and snoring."
14182,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14183,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"No allusion was ever made to my demeanor. I went to school as usual,"
14184,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,and told the school-girls that I had had such a good time at my aunt’s
14185,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,the day before that I would never go there again “as long as I lived.”
14186,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,
14187,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,My grandmother and aunt died long ago. For years I had no reason to
14188,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"believe that my afternoon’s tragedy was known to any one. But once,"
14189,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"not long since, speaking of that clock, I said, “I’m glad it did not"
14190,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,"descend to me;” when a friend replied, with a very knowing look, “So is"
14191,STORY OF THE CLOCK.,your grandmother!”

14205,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14206,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14207,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,Sid’s mother had a way of telling him stories just before he went to
14208,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"bed, and Sid loved bed-time more than any other hour in the day. I"
14209,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,couldn’t begin to tell you all he had learned in this way nor all the
14210,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,places he had been to. When people travel in strange countries they
14211,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,have to have a guide who knows the fine roads and wonderful places to
14212,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,be seen in that part of the world. Now Sid was a little traveller just
14213,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,setting out on a very long journey and it was a very fortunate thing
14214,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,for him that he had his mother as a guide.
14215,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14216,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"When night was coming on and it was getting dark out of doors, the open"
14217,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,wood fire was lighted in the back parlor; and then in the glow which
14218,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"made everything in the room look so queer, with his hand in hers, Sid’s"
14219,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,mother took him off to other lands and even to the Moon.
14220,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14221,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"One night, not long ago, as Sid sat looking into the fire with his head"
14222,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"against his mother’s knee, she said:"
14223,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14224,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Come, Sid, let’s go to Greece and take a ride on a Centaur.”"
14225,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14226,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,Nothing could have pleased Sid more. He hadn’t the slightest idea what
14227,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"a Centaur was, but he loved to ride, and it made very little difference"
14228,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,to him what he rode on.
14229,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14230,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Besides he was tired to-night and didn’t feel like walking; so, with"
14231,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"his eyes half shut, and feeling very, very comfortable, Sid waited for"
14232,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,the Centaur to take him off.
14233,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14234,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Well,” said his mother, in a voice that was always very sweet to him;"
14235,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“there’s a little country in Greece called Thessaly, and it’s full"
14236,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"of caves, and beautiful valleys as well. In one of the caves lived a"
14237,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Centaur named Chiron. He had the body of a horse, but instead of a"
14238,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,horse’s neck and head he had the head and shoulders and body of a man
14239,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,down to the waist. He was a very old and wise Centaur and although he
14240,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,lived in a cave he loved the open air on the high mountains.”
14241,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14242,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,How much longer Sid’s mother talked I don’t know. Although she did not
14243,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"notice it, Sid was gone. He had been carried off by a Centaur. While he"
14244,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,was looking into the fire and wondering what made the coals take such
14245,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,queer shapes he heard a strange noise outside. It wasn’t exactly the
14246,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"neighing of a horse and it was not exactly the voice of a man, but it"
14247,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,was something between the two.
14248,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14249,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“That’s very funny,” said Sid to himself; “wonder what it is!”"
14250,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14251,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,In a moment or two he heard it again and it sounded a great deal
14252,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,nearer than before. Then there was a sharp canter down the road and the
14253,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,clatter of hoofs past the windows. Sid’s mother did not seem to pay
14254,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"any attention to the noise, but she had stopped talking--at least Sid"
14255,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"thought she had, and he got up very quietly, stepped out into the hall"
14256,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and went to the side door. There wasn’t any moon but the stars were
14257,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"shining brightly and there, going round and round the circle of grass"
14258,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"under the apple trees, Sid saw a splendid black horse. As it came round"
14259,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,again to the place where he stood Sid saw that it was not a horse after
14260,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"all, for above its forelegs it had the head and body of a man."
14261,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14262,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,It was a Centaur. Sid had never seen one before and he was sure nobody
14263,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,in that neighborhood owned one. Where it had come from he hadn’t the
14264,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"slightest idea, and if it hadn’t been for the apple trees and the"
14265,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"great, dark church beyond he would have believed he was dreaming."
14266,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14267,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"The Centaur cantered around two or three trees more and then, without"
14268,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"saying a word, as he passed Sid, stretched out his arms, caught the"
14269,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"boy, put him on his back and was off like a racer. No boy ever had such"
14270,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,a ride before and I don’t know that any one ever will again.
14271,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14272,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,No sooner had the Centaur struck the road than he broke into a gallop
14273,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and went thundering along through the night as if a thousand witches
14274,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,or some other horrible creatures were chasing him. His hoofs rang on
14275,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,the hard ground and struck sparks of fire out of the stones along the
14276,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"way. On and on they flew, past houses and orchards and ponds over"
14277,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,which a white mist lay like a soft night dress. They leaped the tall
14278,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,gates without so much as dropping a penny for the keeper who was fast
14279,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"asleep in the little house, and they rushed over bridges as if there"
14280,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,were no notices about fast driving posted up at either end. Faster and
14281,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,faster they flew along until fences and trees and barns were all mixed
14282,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,up together and Sid couldn’t tell one from the other. He thought the
14283,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Centaur couldn’t go any faster, but he was mistaken, for he broke into"
14284,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,a dead run and then such going! It took Sid’s breath away. Every thing
14285,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,vanished and there wasn’t any thing left in the world but himself and
14286,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,the Centaur and the wind that was trying its best to blow him off.
14287,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,There wasn’t any noise either. It was just one tremendous rush. It was
14288,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,like the flight of an arrow that goes straight through the air from
14289,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,the moment it leaves the bow till the moment it strikes the mark and
14290,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,there’s hardly a breath between.
14291,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14292,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"How long the ride was I don’t know for Sid never could tell, but after"
14293,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"a time the Centaur began to slacken speed, broke into a gallop, then"
14294,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,into a gentle trot and finally stopped short. His broad flanks were
14295,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"steaming and he was wet from hoof to hoof, but he did not seem to mind"
14296,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,it.
14297,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14298,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Sid had been a little frightened at first, and you must admit that it"
14299,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,was rather alarming to be picked up and carried off like the wind by
14300,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,a Centaur--but he was a brave boy and soon forgot every thing but the
14301,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,splendid ride he was taking. As soon as the Centaur stopped he slipped
14302,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,down and stood on the ground.
14303,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14304,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,Although it was night the air was so soft and pure and the stars shone
14305,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,so brightly through it that he could see it was a strange country.
14306,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,There were hills every where but they were green and although it was
14307,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,wild it looked beautiful as far as he could see.
14308,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14309,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,The Centaur stretched himself on the ground and Sid saw that although
14310,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,his face was very queer it was quite intelligent. He seemed to be
14311,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,waiting to rest himself. Sid wanted very much to talk with him but he
14312,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,wasn’t sure that he ought to and he didn’t know exactly what to say.
14313,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,There was so much of the horse about the Centaur that Sid couldn’t make
14314,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,up his mind whether he really was a horse or a man.
14315,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14316,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,The Centaur paid no attention to the boy for a long time but finally he
14317,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,turned to him and said:
14318,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14319,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Well, how did you like it?”"
14320,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14321,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"The voice was queer, there was no doubt about that. It made him think"
14322,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"of a horse, but the words were human. The Centaur could speak good"
14323,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"English, there was no doubt about that either."
14324,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14325,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“It was just splendid,” Sid answered. “What made you come for me?”"
14326,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14327,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Why,” replied the Centaur, speaking slowly as if it were not easy for"
14328,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,him to talk; “I knew you could ride and I was sent for you.”
14329,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14330,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,Sid couldn’t understand why he could ride easier than any other boy.
14331,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,“Can’t everybody ride?” he asked in a quick way he has when he is
14332,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,interested in anything.
14333,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14334,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Oh, bless you, no,” said the Centaur; “very few indeed; it all depends"
14335,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"on your mind. Most boys wouldn’t have seen me, much less kept on my"
14336,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,back.”
14337,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14338,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Sid thought that was very queer, but he asked no more questions about"
14339,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,it. He didn’t feel very well acquainted yet.
14340,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14341,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,“Who sent you for me?” he continued at last.
14342,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14343,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Chiron sent me,” answered the Centaur getting on his legs, “and we"
14344,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,must be off.”
14345,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14346,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,He put Sid on his back as before and started on a gentle canter. They
14347,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,were on the side of a mountain with here and there olive trees and
14348,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,pines.
14349,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14350,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,“Where are we?” asked Sid after a moment.
14351,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14352,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,“Is this Thes--Thes--?”
14353,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14354,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Yes,” said the Centaur; “it’s Thessaly.”"
14355,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14356,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,“Where am I going?”
14357,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14358,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“You are going to school,” replied the Centaur."
14359,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14360,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,That rather surprised Sid and didn’t entirely please him. He thought
14361,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"he had enough of school by daylight without going at night too, but he"
14362,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"said nothing, thinking it certainly must be a new kind of school if"
14363,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"they had to send so far for scholars, and wondering whether his father,"
14364,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"who was a minister, would be able to pay the bills."
14365,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14366,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,The road which the Centaur took led them around the mountain and
14367,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,presently they came out into a little level space in the side of the
14368,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,mountain and in front of a cave. In the middle of this grassy place a
14369,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Centaur was lying on his side, and around him were ten or more young"
14370,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"men stretched full length on the ground and leaning on their elbows, in"
14371,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,a half circle.
14372,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14373,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,Sid slid down to the ground and slipped into the little group without
14374,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"being noticed. The Centaur in the middle was very old, so old that he"
14375,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,looked as if he had been alive for centuries; and he had a very wise
14376,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and beautiful face.
14377,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14378,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,The young men were the most splendid fellows Sid had ever seen. They
14379,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"had beautiful forms and noble heads and fine, bright faces, and they"
14380,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"had magnificent arms and chests. They looked like heroes, and I think"
14381,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,most of them were.
14382,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14383,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,This was the school and a very queer school it certainly was. Sid was
14384,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,eight years old and went to a Kindergarten where he had books and
14385,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,blocks and all kinds of things and here they hadn’t so much as a scrap
14386,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"of paper. He was inclined to think it must be a poor affair, but he"
14387,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,thought he would wait until he had heard some of the recitations before
14388,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,he made up his mind. That was the queerest thing of all--there weren’t
14389,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"any recitations. No books, no desks, no black-boards, no recitations!"
14390,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"well, it certainly was a funny school. There wasn’t even a roll called."
14391,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,If there had been Sid would have heard some strange names. That great
14392,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"splendid fellow at the end of the line, with his curly hair all in"
14393,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"confusion about his noble head, was called Hercules, and the next"
14394,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"was Achilles and the next Theseus and then came Castor and Pollux,"
14395,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and Ulysses and Meleager and Æsculapius and others whose names I have
14396,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,forgotten.
14397,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14398,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,While Sid was thinking about these things the old Centaur began to
14399,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,talk. His voice was very low and very sweet and somehow it made Sid
14400,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,feel that the teacher had seen everything there was to be seen in the
14401,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,world and knew everything there was to be known. School was evidently
14402,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,going to begin.
14403,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14404,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“I have told you,” said the Centaur, very slowly, “about the Gods and"
14405,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,the old times when the world was young. I have told of heroes and of
14406,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"the great things they did. I have taught you music which the Gods love,"
14407,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and medicine which is useful for men. I have told you how to be strong
14408,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and high-minded and noble. I have taught you to be brave and true that
14409,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,you may do great things for yourself and the world. By day I have made
14410,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"your bodies firm and sinewy, and at night I made you think of the Gods"
14411,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,who live beyond the stars. What shall I tell you now?”
14412,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14413,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Nobody spoke for a minute and then Ulysses, who had a very wise face"
14414,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"for one so young, said: “Tell us of yourself, oh, Chiron.”"
14415,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14416,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,This seemed to please everybody and all the scholars repeated the words:
14417,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14418,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Tell us of yourself, oh, Chiron.”"
14419,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14420,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“The Centaurs,” began Chiron after a little while, “were born long"
14421,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,before men came into the world. It was a rough place then and needed
14422,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,somebody stronger than men to live in it. So the Gods made us with the
14423,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,strength and swiftness of the animals and yet with some of the thoughts
14424,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"and feelings of men. And we lived in caves and ran through the valleys,"
14425,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,and leaped across the rushing streams and climbed the mountains. And
14426,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,we learned many things about the world and made it easier for men when
14427,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,they came. I think we were sent to do what animals couldn’t do and that
14428,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"now you are come and grown strong to conquer even the animals, our work"
14429,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,is done and we must soon die.”
14430,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14431,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"Just then a little bell rang. At first Sid thought school must be out,"
14432,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,but the bell sounded very familiar to him. In fact it was the cuckoo
14433,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,clock in the front parlor striking nine.
14434,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,
14435,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,"“Bless me, Sid,” said his mother; “you ought to have been in bed an"
14436,BY HAMILTON W. MABIE.,hour ago.”

14444,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14445,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Effie had been playing with her dolls one cold December morning, and"
14446,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Lill had been reading, until both were tired. But it stormed too hard"
14447,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"to go out, and, as Mrs. Pelerine had said they need not do anything"
14448,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"for two hours, their little jaws might have been dislocated by yawning"
14449,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"before they would as much as pick up a pin. Presently Lill said,"
14450,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Effie, shall I tell you a story.”"
14451,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14452,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“O yes! do!” said Effie, and she climbed up by Lill in the large"
14453,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"rocking-chair in front of the grate. She kept very still, for she knew"
14454,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Lill’s stories were not to be interrupted by a sound, or even a motion."
14455,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"The first thing Lill did was to fix her eyes on the fire, and rock"
14456,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"backward and forward quite hard for a little while, and then she said,"
14457,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Now I am going to tell you about my _thought travels_, and they are"
14458,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"apt to be a little queerer, but O! ever so much nicer, than the other"
14459,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],kind!”
14460,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14461,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],[Illustration]
14462,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14463,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],As Lill’s stories usually had a formal introduction she began: “Once
14464,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"upon a time, when I was taking a walk through the great field beyond"
14465,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"the orchard, I went way on, ’round where the path turns behind the"
14466,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"hill. And after I had walked a little way, I came to a high wall--built"
14467,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],right up into the sky. At first I thought I had discovered the ‘ends of
14468,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"the earth,’ or perhaps I had somehow come to the great wall of China."
14469,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"But after walking a long way I came to a large gate, and over it was"
14470,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"printed in beautiful gold letters, ‘SANTA CLAUS LAND,’ and the letters"
14471,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],were large enough for a baby to read!”
14472,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14473,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],How large that might be Lill did not stop to explain.
14474,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14475,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“But the gate was shut tight,” she continued, “and though I knocked and"
14476,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"knocked and knocked, as hard as I could, nobody came to open it. I was"
14477,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"dreadfully disappointed, because I felt as if Santa Claus must live"
14478,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"here all of the year except when he went out to pay Christmas visits,"
14479,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"and it would be so lovely to see him in his own home, you know. But"
14480,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"what was I to do? The gate was entirely too high to climb over, and"
14481,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],there wasn’t even a crack to peek through!”
14482,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14483,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],[Illustration: “LITTLE BAREFOOT CHILDREN RAN OFF WITH THEM.”]
14484,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14485,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Here Lill paused, and Effie drew a long breath, and looked greatly"
14486,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],disappointed. Then Lill went on:
14487,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14488,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“But you see, as I was poking about, I pressed a bell-spring, and"
14489,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"in a moment--jingle, jingle, jingle, the bells went ringing far and"
14490,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"near, with such a merry sound as was never heard before. While they"
14491,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],were still ringing the gate slowly opened and I walked in. I didn’t
14492,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"even stop to inquire if Santa Claus was at home, for I forgot all about"
14493,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"myself and my manners, it was so lovely. First there was a small paved"
14494,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],square like a court; it was surrounded by rows and rows of dark green
14495,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"trees, with several avenues opening between them."
14496,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14497,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“In the centre of the court was a beautiful marble fountain, with"
14498,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],streams of sugar plums and bon-bons tumbling out of it. Funny-looking
14499,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"little men were filling cornucopias at the fountain, and pretty little"
14500,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"barefoot children, with chubby hands and dimpled shoulders, took them"
14501,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"as soon as they were filled, and ran off with them. They were all too"
14502,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"much occupied to speak to me, but as I came up to the fountain one of"
14503,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"the funny little fellows gave me a cornucopia, and I marched on with"
14504,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],the babies.
14505,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14506,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“We went down one of the avenues, which would have been very dark"
14507,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],only it was splendidly lighted up with Christmas candles. I saw the
14508,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"babies were slyly eating a candy or two, so I tasted mine, and they"
14509,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],were delicious--the real Christmas kind. After we had gone a little
14510,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"way, the trees were smaller and not so close together, and here"
14511,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],there were other funny little fellows who were climbing up on ladders
14512,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],and tying toys and bon-bons to the trees. The children stopped and
14513,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"delivered their packages, but I walked on, for there was something"
14514,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],in the distance that I was curious to see. I could see that it was a
14515,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"large garden, that looked as if it might be well cared for, and had"
14516,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],many things growing in it. But even in the distance it didn’t look
14517,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"natural, and when I reached it I found it was a very uncommon kind"
14518,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"of a garden indeed. I could scarcely believe my eyes, but there were"
14519,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"dolls and donkeys and drays and cars and croquet coming up in long,"
14520,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"straight rows, and ever so many other things beside. In one place the"
14521,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],wooden dolls had only just started; their funny little heads were just
14522,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"above ground, and I thought they looked very much surprised at their"
14523,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"surroundings. Farther on were china dolls, that looked quite grown up,"
14524,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],and I suppose were ready to pull; and a gardener was hoeing a row of
14525,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"soldiers that didn’t look in a very healthy condition, or as if they"
14526,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],had done very well.
14527,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14528,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“The gardener looked familiar, I thought, and as I approached him he"
14529,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"stopped work and, leaning on his hoe he said, ‘How do you do, Lilian? I"
14530,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],am very glad to see you.’
14531,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14532,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“The moment he raised his face I knew it was Santa Claus, for he looked"
14533,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],exactly like the portrait we have of him. You can easily believe I was
14534,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"glad then! I ran and put both of my hands in his, fairly shouting that"
14535,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],I was so glad to find him.
14536,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14537,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],“He laughed and said:
14538,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14539,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘Why, I am generally to be found here or hereabouts, for I work in the"
14540,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],grounds every day.’
14541,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14542,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“And I laughed too, because his laugh sounded so funny; like the brook"
14543,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"going over stones, and the wind up in the trees. Two or three times,"
14544,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"when I thought he had done he would burst out again, laughing the"
14545,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"vowels in this way: ‘Ha, ha, ha, ha! He, he, he, he, he! Hi, hi, hi,"
14546,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"hi, hi! Ho, ho, ho, h-o-oo!’”"
14547,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14548,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Lill did it very well, and Effie laughed till the tears came to her"
14549,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"eyes; and she could quite believe Lill when she said, “It grew to be"
14550,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"so funny that I couldn’t stand, but fell over into one of the little"
14551,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],chairs that were growing in a bed just beyond the soldiers.
14552,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14553,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“When Santa Claus saw that he stopped suddenly, saying:"
14554,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14555,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘There, that will do. I take a hearty laugh every day, for the sake of"
14556,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],digestion.’
14557,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14558,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Then he added, in a whisper, ‘That is the reason I live so long and"
14559,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],don’t grow old. I’ve been the same age ever since the chroniclers began
14560,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"to take notes, and those who are best able to judge think I’ll continue"
14561,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],to be this way for about one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six
14562,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"years longer,--they probably took a new observation at the Centennial,"
14563,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],and they know exactly.’
14564,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14565,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“I was greatly delighted to hear this, and I told him so. He nodded"
14566,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"and winked and said it was ‘all right,’ and then asked if I’d like to"
14567,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"see the place. I said I would, so he threw down the hoe with a sigh,"
14568,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"saying, ‘I don’t believe I shall have more than half a crop of soldiers"
14569,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"this season. They came up well, but the arms and legs seem to be weak."
14570,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"When I get to town I’ll have to send out some girls with glue pots, to"

14573,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“The town was at some distance, and our path took us by flower-beds"
14574,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"where some exquisite little toys were growing, and a hot-bed where"
14575,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],new varieties were being prop--_propagated_. Pretty soon we came to a
14576,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"plantation of young trees, with rattles, and rubber balls, and ivory"
14577,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"rings growing on the branches, and as we went past they rang and"
14578,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],bounded about in the merriest sort of a way.
14579,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14580,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘There’s a nice growth,’ said Santa Claus, and it _was_ a nice growth"
14581,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],for babies; but just beyond I saw something so perfectly splendid that
14582,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],I didn’t care about the plantation.”
14583,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14584,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Well,” said Lill impressively, seeing that Effie was sufficiently"
14585,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"expectant, “it was a lovely grove. The trees were large, with long"
14586,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"drooping branches, and the branches were just loaded with dolls’"
14587,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"clothes. There were elegant silk dresses, with lovely sashes of every"
14588,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],color--”
14589,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14590,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],Just here Effie couldn’t help saying “O!” for she had a weakness for
14591,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"sashes. Lill looked stern, and put a warning hand over her mouth, and"
14592,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],went on.
14593,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14594,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“There was everything that the most fashionable doll could want,"
14595,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"growing in the greatest profusion. Some of the clothes had fallen,"
14596,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"and there were funny-looking girls picking them up, and packing them"
14597,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"in trunks and boxes. ‘These are all ripe,’ said Santa Claus, stopping"
14598,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"to shake a tree, and the clothes came tumbling down so fast that the"
14599,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"workers were busier than ever. The grove was on a hill, so that we"
14600,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],had a beautiful view of the country. First there was a park filled
14601,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"with reindeer, and beyond that was the town, and at one side a large"
14602,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],farm-yard filled with animals of all sorts.”

14605,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14606,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],“But as Santa Claus seemed in a hurry I did not stop long to look.
14607,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Our path led through the park, and we stopped to call ‘Prancer’ and"
14608,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"‘Dancer’ and ‘Donder’ and ‘Blitzen,’ and Santa Claus fed them with"
14609,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],lumps of sugar from his pocket. He pointed out ‘Comet’ and ‘Cupid’ in a
14610,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],distant part of the park; ‘Dasher’ and ‘Vixen’ were nowhere to be seen.
14611,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14612,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Here I found most of the houses were Swiss cottages, but there were"
14613,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"some fine churches and public buildings, all of beautifully illustrated"
14614,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"building blocks, and we stopped for a moment at a long depot, in which"
14615,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],a locomotive was just _smashing up_.
14616,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14617,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],“Santa Claus’ house stood in the middle of the town. It was an
14618,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"old-fashioned looking house, very broad and low, with an enormous"
14619,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"chimney. There was a wide step in front of the door, shaded by a"
14620,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"fig-tree and grape-vine, and morning-glories and scarlet beans"
14621,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],clambered by the side of the latticed windows; and there were great
14622,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"round rose-bushes, with great, round roses, on either side of the walk"
14623,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],leading to the door.”
14624,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14625,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“O! it must have smelled like a party,” said Effie, and then subsided,"
14626,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],as she remembered that she was interrupting.
14627,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14628,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Inside, the house was just cozy and comfortable, a real grandfatherly"
14629,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"sort of a place. A big chair was drawn up in front of the window, and a"
14630,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],big book was open on a table in front of the chair. A great pack half
14631,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"made up was on the floor, and Santa Claus stopped to add a few things"
14632,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"from his pocket. Then he went to the kitchen, and brought me a lunch of"
14633,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"milk and strawberries and cookies, for he said I must be tired after my"
14634,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],long walk.
14635,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14636,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“After I had rested a little while, he said if I liked I might go with"
14637,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],him to the observatory. But just as we were starting a funny little
14638,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],fellow stopped at the door with a wheelbarrow full of boxes of dishes.
14639,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],After Santa Claus had taken the boxes out and put them in the pack he
14640,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"said slowly,--"
14641,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14642,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],“‘Let me see!’
14643,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14644,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“He laid his finger beside his nose as he said it, and looked at me"
14645,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"attentively, as if I were a sum in addition, and he was adding me up."
14646,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"I guess I must have come out right, for he looked satisfied, and said"
14647,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"I’d better go to the mine first, and then join him in the observatory."
14648,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Now I am afraid he was not exactly polite not to go with me himself,”"
14649,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"added Lill, gravely, “but then he apologized by saying he had some work"
14650,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"to do. So I followed the little fellow with the wheelbarrow, and we"
14651,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"soon came to what looked like the entrance of a cave, but I suppose it"
14652,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],was the mine. I followed my guide to the interior without stopping to
14653,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],look at the boxes and piles of dishes outside. Here I found other funny
14654,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"little people, busily at work with picks and shovels, taking out wooden"
14655,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"dishes from the bottom of the cave, and china and glass from the top"
14656,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"and sides, for the dishes hung down just like stalactites in Mammoth"

14658,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14659,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Here Lill opened the book she had been reading, and showed Effie a"
14660,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],picture of the stalactites.
14661,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14662,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“It was so curious and so pretty that I should have remained longer,”"
14663,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"said Lill, “only I remembered the observatory and Santa Claus."
14664,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14665,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“When I went outside I heard his voice calling out, ‘Lilian! Lilian!’"
14666,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"It sounded a great way off, and yet somehow it seemed to fill the air"
14667,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"just as the wind does. I only had to look for a moment, for very near"
14668,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],by was a high tower. I wonder I did not see it before; but in these
14669,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],queer countries you are sure to see something new every time you look
14670,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"about. Santa Claus was standing up at a window near the top, and I"
14671,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],ran to the entrance and commenced climbing the stairs. It was a long
14672,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"journey, and I was quite out of breath when I came to the end of it."
14673,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"But here there was such a cozy, luxurious little room, full of stuffed"
14674,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"chairs and lounges, bird cages and flowers in the windows, and pictures"
14675,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"on the wall, that it was delightful to rest. There was a lady sitting"
14676,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"by a golden desk, writing in a large book, and Santa Claus was looking"
14677,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"through a great telescope, and every once in a while he stopped and put"
14678,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],his ear to a large speaking-tube. While I was resting he went on with
14679,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],his observations.”

14686,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],“‘Two bad ones for Isaac Clappertongue; he’ll drive his mother to the

14694,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘And give Ruth Olive ten, for she is a peace-maker’”"
14695,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14696,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Just then he happened to look at me and saw I was rested, so"
14697,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],he politely asked what I thought of the country. I said it was
14698,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"magnificent. He said he was sorry I didn’t stop in the green-house,"
14699,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],where he had wax dolls and other delicate things growing. I was very
14700,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"sorry about that, and then I said I thought he must be very happy to"
14701,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],own so many delightful things.
14702,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14703,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘Of course I’m happy,’ said Santa Claus, and then he sighed. ‘But it"
14704,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],is an awful responsibility to reward so many children according to
14705,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"their deserts. For I take these observations every day, and I know who"
14706,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],is good and who is bad.’
14707,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14708,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“I was glad he told me about this, and now, if he would only tell me"
14709,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"what time of day he took the observations, I would have obtained really"
14710,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],valuable information. So I stood up and made my best courtesy and
14711,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"said,--"
14712,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14713,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘Please, sir, would you tell me what time of day you usually look?’"
14714,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14715,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘O,’ he answered, carelessly, ‘any time from seven in the morning till"
14716,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],ten at night. I am not a bit particular about time. I often go without
14717,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],my own meals in order to make a record of table manners. For instance:
14718,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"last evening I saw you turn your spoon over in your mouth, and that’s"
14719,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],very unmannerly for a girl nearly fourteen.’
14720,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14721,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘O, I didn’t know _you_ were looking,’ said I, very much ashamed;"
14722,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"‘and I’ll never do it again,’ I promised."
14723,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14724,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“Then he said I might look through the telescope, and I looked right"
14725,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"down into our house. There was mother very busy and very tired, and all"
14726,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"of the children teasing. It was queer, for I was there, too, and the"
14727,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"_bad-est_ of any. Pretty soon I ran to a quiet corner with a book, and"
14728,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"in a few minutes mamma had to leave her work and call, ‘Lilian, Lilian,"
14729,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],it’s time for you to practise.’
14730,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14731,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“‘Yes, mamma,’ I answered, ‘I’ll come right away.’"
14732,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14733,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"“As soon as I said this Santa Claus whistled for ‘Comet’ and ‘Cupid,’"
14734,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"and they came tearing up the tower. He put me in a tiny sleigh, and"
14735,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"away we went, over great snow-banks of clouds, and before I had time"
14736,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"to think I was landed in the big chair, and mamma was calling ‘Lilian,"
14737,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"Lilian, it’s time for you to practise,’ just as she is doing now, and I"

14741,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14742,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],Effie sank back in the chair to think. She wished Lill had found out
14743,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa"

14746,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],
14747,BY ELLIS TOWNE.],"But when she asked about some of them afterwards, Lill said she didn’t"

14761,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14762,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14763,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Why don’t you write a story, Tom?” said Jim."
14764,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14765,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Can’t,” said I; “never did such a thing in my life.”"
14766,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14767,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,You see the beginning of it all was Jim’s coming home for a three
14768,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,months’ leave. Jim’s in the navy and just home from Japan. So he came
14769,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"to see us, and so I broke my leg. When we came home from school we had"
14770,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"planned no end of larks for the vacation, what with the Christmas tree"
14771,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"and sleighing and skating and coasting, and making candy over to Aunt"
14772,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Lewes’, and going into Boston to Pinafore and having Charlotte-russe at"
14773,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Parker’s, and all the rest."
14774,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14775,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"So the first thing I did the very night after we got home, was to fall"
14776,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"through a bad place in the stable floor and break my leg, and Will said"
14777,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,it was lucky it wasn’t one of the horses. Of course that finished my
14778,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"fun, for I could not go anywhere with the rest, but just had to lie"
14779,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,there with my leg in splints; and though of course I had my presents
14780,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"just the same, I was mad all the vacation."
14781,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14782,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"It wasn’t any great fun, you’d better believe, to lie on a lounge and"
14783,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,stick in the house and see Will going everywhere and having no end of
14784,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,jolly times every day.
14785,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14786,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Then when the Saturday came for him to go back to Dr. Thomas’s and
14787,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"leave me behind, and I thought of seeing all the fellows and hearing"
14788,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"what they had for presents and all that, I concluded that if I’d been"
14789,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,well I’d have been glad for once in my life even to go back to school.
14790,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"It wasn’t that I didn’t have enough done for me either, for mother and"
14791,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Jennie, the cook, almost cured me of ever liking cream cakes and jam"
14792,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"again, by the heaps of it they gave me. Nell made me more neckties than"
14793,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"I can wear in ten years, and played backgammon by the hour. Father"
14794,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"brought me a new book from the city nearly every night, and Jim told"
14795,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,me more stories--“yarns” he called them--and he and I made the most
14796,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,complete man-of-war that ever was seen in these parts. So you can see
14797,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"that I was not neglected, but I tell you there’s nothing like being"
14798,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,well and having two whole legs to stand on. I’d got pretty tired of
14799,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"reading and jig-sawing and painting, and one afternoon I’d been"
14800,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"telling them about the time we broke Bob Richards in at school, and"
14801,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,says Jim:
14802,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14803,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Tom, old fellow,” says he, “why don’t you write a story. Write it all"
14804,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"out, and send it to WIDE AWAKE; you never know what you can do till you"
14805,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"try,” says he."
14806,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14807,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"I thought I couldn’t at first, but the next day Jim had to drive over"
14808,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"to Medford, and Nell had to go too to match mother’s gray dress and"
14809,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"get some red ribbons for the dog. They both went off, and mother had a"
14810,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"caller down stairs, so I was left all alone, and that’s how I came to"
14811,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,write about it anyway.
14812,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14813,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,You see our fellows have always had a fashion of giving the new boys a
14814,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“breaking in.” The thing began by just doubling up the bed clothes, or"
14815,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"sewing up the fellow’s sleeves, and then they got to ducking them and"
14816,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"scaring them with ghosts, and when at last they pumped on little Fred"
14817,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Harris and frightened him into brain fever, Dr. Thomas forbade anything"
14818,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,more of the sort.
14819,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14820,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Now when Dr. Thomas says anything he has a way of meaning it, so we"
14821,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,fellows were surprised enough when one day Jeff Ryder came into the gym
14822,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"where we were having a circus, and said: “I tell you what let’s do!"
14823,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Let’s give Bob Richards a regular breaking in!”
14824,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14825,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Yes I would, Jeff,” said Harry Thorndike, in the odd, quiet way he had"
14826,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"with him. Harry Thorndike was our head boy, and entered Harvard last"
14827,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"summer. “Yes, I would,” says he, “and get sent home for a month; it"
14828,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,would be no end of fun. I would.”
14829,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14830,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Of course we boys all looked at Jeff when Harry spoke in that way, to"
14831,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"see if he didn’t feel cheap, but he didn’t, a bit."
14832,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14833,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“I’ll take all the blame,” says he, “and I’ll risk being sent home.”"
14834,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14835,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"So then he told us all about his plan, and we thought it was a jolly"
14836,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,good one too.
14837,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14838,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Bob Richards was a new fellow; only been there four weeks; and when he
14839,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,first came we thought he was a regular moon-calf. He was rather small
14840,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"of his age and had a kind of pinched, half-starved look, as if he’d"
14841,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,never had a good square meal from soup clear through to pudding in
14842,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"his life. He was homesick and lonesome too, and we got into the way"
14843,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"of calling him “baby” and “sissy,” but he never seemed to mind a bit,"
14844,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"but would always help a fellow with his lessons just the same, and was"
14845,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,first-class in any game.
14846,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14847,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"One day Ralph Bixby, the bully of the school, said something about"
14848,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Richard’s mother, and I just wish you could have seen that little"
14849,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,fellow fire up.
14850,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14851,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“You say what you like about me,” says he, “but don’t you say anything"
14852,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"about my mother; it won’t be best for you, Bixby.”"
14853,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14854,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Do you want to fight?” says Bixby, bristling up like a turkey cock."
14855,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14856,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“It is not fighting I am after,” says Richards, very quietly, “but I"
14857,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,can fight if there is need of it.”
14858,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14859,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"But Bixby said he wouldn’t fight with an underclass man, and then"
14860,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,went off and told Dr. Thomas that little Richards had been offering
14861,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"to fight. We all liked little Richards, for he was clear grit right"
14862,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,through and no mistake. So when Jeff told us his plan we all agreed to
14863,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,it and there weren’t more than half a dozen of us fellows that knew
14864,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"about it, and we didn’t have to go and tell everyone about it either,"
14865,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,as girls would.

14869,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"At last the term was ended, and we were going home next day; that is,"
14870,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"all we fellows who had any homes to go to, or any invitations to"
14871,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"visit. But Bob Richards, he didn’t have any place to go because his"
14872,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"mother was poor and lived way down in Machias, and it was too far away."
14873,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,So most boys would have been ugly about it and envious of the other
14874,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"boys, but Richards wasn’t a bit. Will and I were though, one winter"
14875,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"when all our people were away in Germany, and we had to stay at the"
14876,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,school or else go to Aunt Jocelyn’s. We don’t like very well to go to
14877,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Aunt Jocelyn’s, for she always has cold meat and rice pudding without"
14878,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"any plums, and says that she likes to see boys sober and useful. She"
14879,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,gave Will and me dictionaries for Christmas presents. So we’d rather
14880,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,go most anywhere than to Aunt Jocelyn’s. But we were mad though to
14881,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"think we had to stay at the school, and Will told one of the fellows"
14882,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,that he’d punch him if he didn’t stop looking so glad.
14883,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14884,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Little Richards you would have thought was going himself, he looked so"
14885,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"glad and happy, and rushed about up and down stairs into all the rooms,"
14886,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"helping the fellows pack and cord their trunks, strap up their valises,"
14887,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"and directing cards for their boxes, and you’d have thought he was"
14888,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,going himself sure enough.
14889,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14890,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Don’t you wish you were going home, Richards?” said Ned Smith. He is"
14891,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"one of those fellows who are always saying things they ought not to,"
14892,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,though not meaning to be hateful. He’d do no end of things for a fellow
14893,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"who was sick, and then like as not tell him something that would make"
14894,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,him sicker than ever. So he couldn’t think of anything better to say
14895,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,than to ask little Richards if he didn’t wish he was going home.
14896,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14897,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Why, yes,” said Bob, in the bright, quick way he had with him; “why,"
14898,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"yes, of course I wish I was going home, but if I can’t I can’t, so"
14899,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,there’s an end to it. Besides I’m going home next summer; it’ll only be
14900,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,twenty-five weeks.”
14901,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14902,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Just to think of his speaking of it in that chipper way, as if he’d"
14903,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,said twenty-five minutes instead of weeks.
14904,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14905,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"The packing was all done after a while, and we were ready for an early"
14906,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"start next morning. We had eaten our last supper, beef-steak and fried"
14907,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,potatoes--we always have a sort of extra good supper the last night
14908,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,of the term. Then after supper we had a good time in Mrs. Thomas’ own
14909,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"room, with her two babies and her cousin who played the piano for us,"
14910,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,and by ten o’clock we were all in our rooms and the house got still.
14911,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14912,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,It was eleven o’clock when we heard three mews and a scratch like a
14913,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"cat, which was Jeff Ryder’s signal; he could have opened the door and"
14914,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"come in just as well, but he was always very fond of giving all kinds"
14915,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,of signs.
14916,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14917,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,We opened the door and there were Hal Thorndike and the two Everett
14918,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,boys and Jeff. Will and I had a room alone. We came out and joined them
14919,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"and went up stairs trying to keep still, though Will would giggle, and"
14920,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,he and Jeff had a scuffle on the landing about which should go in and
14921,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,get Bob out of bed.
14922,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14923,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,At last Harry Thorndike settled it by telling them both to go. They had
14924,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,masks that Jeff and I made of black cloth with holes cut through for
14925,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,the eyes and mouth.
14926,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14927,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"So they went in and waked up Bob, and said in a horrid, scarey sort of"
14928,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"way, “Unhappy mortal! prepare to suffer your doom! Arise and proceed to"
14929,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,the hall of judgment!”
14930,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14931,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"He wasn’t more than half awake, but he was clear pluck, and he came out"
14932,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,shivering with cold and with a blanket round his shoulders.
14933,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14934,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"The boys had blindfolded him, and they led him round and round till"
14935,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"he was pretty well mixed up, and then they took him to the Hall of"
14936,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Judgment, which was Harry Thorndike’s room."
14937,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14938,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,The two younger boys staid with him while we older ones fell to work
14939,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,like beavers in Bob’s room.
14940,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14941,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"We had a hard time though you’d better believe, trying to keep quiet,"
14942,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,for the fellows would forget every now and then and speak or laugh out
14943,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"loud. We had Archibald, the school janitor, up to help us, and we made"
14944,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,quick work of what we had to do I can tell you.
14945,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14946,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"To begin with, his room was just the forlornest place that ever you"
14947,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"saw, and no mistake! We furnish our own rooms at Dr. Thomas’, and we"
14948,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,always try to fix them up rather gorgeous. Our mothers and sisters
14949,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,are always sending us gimcracks to make our dens kind of gay. Then
14950,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"if fellows happen to have any girl friends you know, they are always"
14951,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"sending them tidies and such trash for philopene presents, and though"
14952,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"we don’t much care to have the things round under feet, somehow if one"
14953,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"fellow has them, all the rest wants them too."
14954,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14955,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"But I just wish you could have seen little Richards’ room! the barest,"
14956,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"coldest place! There was no carpet, only a common sort of rug before"
14957,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"the little old stove, that was so wheezy and full of cracks that it"
14958,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"would not do much but smoke anyway. There was a bedstead, and his study"
14959,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"table with his books on it. There was a picture of his mother, and"
14960,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"one of his sister--rather pretty she was too, with smiling eyes like"
14961,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Richards’, and soft hair in little rings about her forehead and face."
14962,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Thorndike said that she would be very pretty when she was older--say
14963,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,seventeen. Mrs. Thomas’ cousin is sixteen and a half. Bob had put a
14964,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,little wreath of some kind round the two pictures. There was a plant
14965,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"too on the table. He brought it in his hand all the way from Machias,"
14966,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"with a brown paper bag over the top of it, and now it was just ready to"
14967,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,bloom.
14968,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
14969,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,The first thing we did was to bring in a big warm carpet all made and
14970,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"fitted to the room, and we spread it down, but didn’t nail it because"
14971,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,of the noise and because we thought he’d like to do it himself. Then
14972,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"we covered the old table and mantle with jolly, bright cloths. We"
14973,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,never could have picked them out in the world if it hadn’t been for
14974,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Mrs. Thomas’ cousin, the one who played on the piano for us. She is"
14975,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"rather nice for a girl, and sometimes wears little gold horse-shoes in"
14976,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"her ears. Jeff Ryder is going to marry her when he is twenty-one, but"
14977,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"nobody knows it yet, not even she. Jeff only told me one night when I"
14978,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,had a sore throat and he slept with me. So she helped us pick out the
14979,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"things, and gave us a tidy, and a pin-cushion the size of a bean bag."
14980,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Then we moved in a first-class stove, and Archibald set her up and"
14981,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,built a rouser of a fire in her. We put a pair of new blankets on the
14982,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"bed, and Jeff Ryder brought out a student’s lamp--one of the double"
14983,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,headers; the two Belknap boys--that means Will and me--gave a big easy
14984,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,chair to go beside the table; then the Everett boys gave a set of
14985,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"book shelves; and Dr. Thomas gave a box of books, as many as a dozen"
14986,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"I should think. We left these in the box, for Will and I always think"
14987,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,that half the fun of having presents is opening the bundles ourselves.
14988,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Harry Thorndike gave the stove and a little clock from his own room.
14989,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"We put the pin-cushion on the bureau, and the tidy on the chair, and"
14990,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"while we were standing there looking at it all, there came the very"
14991,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,softest kind of a step outside and there was the Doctor’s wife. She had
14992,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"a picture in her arms, one that I had seen a good many times in her own"
14993,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,sitting-room. It was quite a large picture of a woman with a sort of
14994,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,hood on her hair and a baby in her arms; both the woman and the baby
14995,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"had a kind of shiny hoop just above their heads in the air, looking as"
14996,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,if in a minute they’d drop down and make crowns. Will told me once that
14997,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"he thought it was a picture of Mrs. Thomas and the baby, but I think"
14998,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"not, though there was the same kind of look too on both their faces."
14999,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15000,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Hang this up, boys,” she said; “he is very fond of it, and I have had"
15001,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"it for a good many years. I’ve babies of my own now to look at, so we"
15002,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,will give this to Bob. Let us hang it over the mantle-piece.”
15003,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15004,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,There is something rather queer about the Doctor’s wife. It isn’t that
15005,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"she isn’t pretty, for she is; and it isn’t that she is odd or old, for"
15006,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"she is younger a good deal than the Doctor, and as kind and jolly as a"
15007,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"girl; but there is something queer about her, for I don’t know how many"
15008,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,fellows have said she seemed just like their mothers; and what I want
15009,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,to know is how in creation can she look and seem like the mothers of so
15010,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"many boys--dark and light, and homely and handsome, English, German,"
15011,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"American, and even one colored fellow said she made him think of his"
15012,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“mammy.” I think it must be a kind of motherish way which she has, that"
15013,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,makes us all feel so about her.
15014,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15015,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"She gave the picture to Hal Thorndike and he hung it up, and I tell you"
15016,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,the room did look just immense.
15017,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15018,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Then we went down stairs and brought Bob up again, and sat him down"
15019,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"in his new chair, and told him not to take off his blinder till he’d"
15020,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"counted three hundred, and then we all ran down into Will’s and my"
15021,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,room to wait and see what he would do. We rather expected to hear him
15022,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"shout, or tear round, or do something or other; but we counted three"
15023,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"hundred two or three times over, and not a sound came from his room."
15024,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15025,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,By and by Jeff said he was going up to see what the row was--which was
15026,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"only his way of speaking; for you couldn’t call it a row, could you,"
15027,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,when there wasn’t a sound to be heard!
15028,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15029,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Jeff didn’t come back, and then Will said he’d go and see where Jeff"
15030,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"was, so Hal said it was like Clever Alice and her cheeses that she sent"
15031,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"rolling down hill after each other; but at last the two boys came back,"
15032,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"not grinning at all, but solemn and long-faced enough."
15033,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15034,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“I guess he’s mad,” said Jeff; “anyhow he can’t be glad, for he’s"
15035,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,howling!” which was another of Jeff’s ways of speaking; for Bob
15036,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,certainly was not howling.
15037,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15038,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“I don’t see what he wants to act that way for,” said Will. “I bet I"
15039,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,wouldn’t if I had so many things given to me at once!”
15040,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15041,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“You can’t always tell,” said Hal. “It isn’t always a sign a fellow is"
15042,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,mad if he howls. I howled like a good one when my father came home from
15043,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"sea, when I was a little fellow, a good many years ago.”"
15044,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15045,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Let’s go up and see what’s the matter with him,” said I."
15046,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15047,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,“Let’s go to bed!” said Harry. “Don’t one of you young rats go near his
15048,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"room to-night, or I’ll report you to the Doctor!”"
15049,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15050,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"We all laughed, for of course we knew he’d never report us; he isn’t"
15051,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"that kind; but we minded what Hal said all the same, as everybody has"
15052,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"a way of doing, and we didn’t hear a sound more till morning, and the"
15053,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,gong waked us up.
15054,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15055,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,And then there was Archibald at the door to help with the trunks
15056,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"and boxes, and the lamps were lighted in the dining-room, and there"
15057,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"were fritters and syrup for breakfast, but they were too hot to eat."
15058,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,Then there was Jeff Ryder with a present for the Doctor’s wife’s
15059,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"cousin--some candy in a jolly, silver box, lined with blue silk (Jeff"
15060,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"will spend all his quarter’s money on one thing), and there in a dark"
15061,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"corner of the stairs was the cousin herself, with a little pink sack"
15062,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"on, crying about something, and Harry Thorndike was leaning on the"
15063,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"balusters saying, as I came along, “Why Anette, child, it’s only for"
15064,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"two weeks anyhow! Come, don’t send me off this way; can’t you wish me a"
15065,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,merry Christmas?”
15066,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15067,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Then they shouted that the big sleigh was ready, and I thought we were"
15068,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,going to get off without having to see Bob at all.
15069,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15070,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"So I rushed out through the hall and down the slippery steps, but there"
15071,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"was Bob before me, very white in the face, and with his eyes looking"
15072,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,more than ever like his sister’s.
15073,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15074,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,I tell you we fellows felt awful cheap; a sight cheaper than Bob did
15075,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"himself. Jeff Ryder whispered to me that he was going to bolt, but it"
15076,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,was no go. Bob stepped right in front of us.
15077,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15078,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“Boys,” said he; “boys, you must let me--if I only could tell you--if"
15079,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,you only knew--” and just then Hal Thorndike came along (the cousin had
15080,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,run away up-stairs) and set things right as he has a way of doing.
15081,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15082,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"“All right, youngster,” he said; “we know just what you want to say--no"
15083,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"one who looked at you could accuse you of being ungrateful. Let up now,"
15084,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"old fellow, don’t say a word more, but go up to my room and see if I"
15085,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,left my watch-key on the bureau.”
15086,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15087,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Bob ran off, and Harry said, “now cut for it, fellows!” says he; “hip,"
15088,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"vamoose, get, pile into the sleigh, or he’ll be back again, thanking"
15089,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,you worse than ever!”
15090,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15091,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"So in we jumped, the whip cracked, the bells jingled, and we gave three"
15092,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"cheers for the Doctor, and three more for his wife, and then we dashed"
15093,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,away.
15094,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15095,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"Of course, little Richards wrote to us, but a letter isn’t half so bad"
15096,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,as to have a fellow brace right up and thank you before your face and
15097,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"eyes. So we got out of it pretty well after all, didn’t we?"
15098,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,
15099,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"And this is all there is about “Bob’s ‘Breaking In,’” and not much of"
15100,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,a story either to write all out and send to a magazine. But you see Jim
15101,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,"told me to, and it was lonesome with Jim and Nell and mother gone, and"
15102,BY ELEANOR PUTNAM.,only the cat for company the whole afternoon.

15121,THE FIRST HUNT,
15122,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,BY J. H. WOODBURY.
15123,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15124,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15125,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Ephraim Bartlett’s first hunting adventure was of such a serio-comic
15126,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,nature that it seems really worth relating.
15127,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15128,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Ephraim’s father was a “selectman.” He had also been a captain of
15129,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"militia in his younger days, and therefore it happened that in speaking"
15130,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"of him everybody called him “The Captain.” He bore his honors meekly,"
15131,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"was a well-to-do farmer, and very much respected."
15132,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15133,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"It was town-meeting day--early in November,--when, of course the"
15134,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"captain had to go to the polls to look after the voting, and help count"
15135,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the votes. It was delightful Indian-summer weather, too; one of the"
15136,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"last of those soft hazy days in the late autumn, when there is such a"
15137,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,quiet beauty over the earth that it seems of heaven itself. When even
15138,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the winds forget to blow; and it seems, at times, as if all nature"
15139,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"were asleep. Then can be heard, in the edge of the distant forest, the"
15140,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"tapping of woodpeckers, the barking of squirrels, and the hoarse cries"
15141,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"of blue-jays, so distinctly does every slight sound reach you through"
15142,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the still atmosphere. It was on such a day that the captain and his
15143,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"hired man went to town-meeting, leaving Ephraim “the only man on the"
15144,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,farm.”
15145,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15146,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Now Ephraim had been all the fall longing for a hunt; but his father
15147,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"had not time to go hunting with him, and he thought Ephraim too"
15148,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"young to go alone. His father had no objection to his going alone,"
15149,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,if he would only go without a gun; but Ephraim could not see the
15150,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,use of hunting without a gun. He longed to get into the woods with
15151,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"his father’s old training gun, all alone. This old piece was rather"
15152,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"heavy for sporting purposes; but it was always kept in perfect order,"
15153,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"standing in a corner of the captain’s bed-room, behind his desk."
15154,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15155,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"So, after his father was gone, and while his mother was busied about"
15156,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the house, the temptation to take that gun was more than Ephraim could"
15157,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"withstand. Watching his opportunity, he first secured the powder-horn"
15158,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and shot-pouch out of the drawer where they were kept, and then he"
15159,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"took the musket, and bore it stealthily away behind the barn. He felt"
15160,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"in a hurry, and as if he were not doing quite right, and was not quite"
15161,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"easy in his mind, even after he had got the gun out of sight. He half"
15162,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"resolved to carry it back at once, but finally concluded that he could"
15163,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"return it just as well after he had had his hunt, and went to work to"
15164,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,load it.
15165,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15166,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Ephraim was not quite sure how the gun should be loaded; but the powder
15167,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"seemed the most essential thing, so he put a handful of that in first."
15168,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Then, without any wad between, as there should have been, he put in a"
15169,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"handful of shot; and they were large enough, he thought, to kill almost"
15170,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"anything. He put a very big wad on top of these, and rammed it hard"
15171,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"down with the iron ramrod. It was a flint-lock piece, and he knew that"
15172,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,powder would be needed in the pan; so he opened it to put some in. But
15173,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the pan was already filled; for in ramming down the charge the piece
15174,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,had primed itself.
15175,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15176,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"It was all right, Ephraim felt sure, and, keeping the barn between him"
15177,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and the house, he went towards the wood."
15178,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15179,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,It was a lonely old wood. I often went through it myself when I was a
15180,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"boy, and I know all about it. In the brightest day it would be dark"
15181,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and gloomy under some of those great, wide-spreading, low-branched"
15182,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,hemlocks. There were all kinds of wood there that are found in a New
15183,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"England forest; beech, birch, maple, oak, pine, hemlock and chestnut;"
15184,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and partridges, squirrels, rabbits, owls,--in fact, all sorts of small"
15185,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,game made it their home.
15186,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15187,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,With the gun on his shoulder Ephraim entered the woods and went
15188,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"trudging straight into it, as if all the game worth shooting were in"
15189,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the middle of it. He could hear the squirrels and blue-jays in the high
15190,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"branches overhead; but it was his first hunt, and he was resolved to"
15191,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,have something bigger.
15192,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15193,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"His progress was suddenly arrested, however, by the appearance of a"
15194,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"very sedate-looking bird, as large as a good-sized fowl, with a thick"
15195,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"muffler of feathers around its throat and shoulders, that sat perched"
15196,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"on a dead limb before him. The bird was facing him, and when he stopped"
15197,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"it stretched its neck downward, and turned its head to one side as if"
15198,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,to listen or observe his movements. Ephraim wondered why it did not fly
15199,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"away, but presently it occurred to him that it was an owl, and could"
15200,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,not see him.
15201,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15202,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Ah!” thought he, “you are just the fellow I’m looking for! Now just"
15203,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"stay where you are a minute, and I’ll fix you!”"
15204,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15205,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He had to find a rest before he could hold his gun steady, and then he"
15206,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,was sure to take good aim. But he had to draw so hard on the trigger
15207,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"that he closed his eyes, just as the gun went off; and when he opened"
15208,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,them again he was looking another way.
15209,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15210,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,The action of his piece seemed unaccountable. It had started backward
15211,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"so suddenly as to throw him over, and there was a pain in his shoulder"
15212,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"as if it had been hit. But he was sure he had killed the owl, and,"
15213,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"looking for it, he was again surprised to see it sailing noiselessly"
15214,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"away. It seemed in no great haste, and evidently had not started"
15215,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"without due reflection. It stopped, before going out of sight, and"
15216,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"remained perched on another dry limb, as if waiting for Ephraim to come"
15217,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,and shoot it again.
15218,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15219,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Without reflecting at all as to whether he would be any better off
15220,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"after shooting that owl, or whether it had not just as good a right"
15221,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"to live as he, Ephraim sprang up, seeing that there was a chance for"
15222,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"another shot, and made all haste to reload his piece."
15223,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15224,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He put the powder and shot in without any wad between, as"
15225,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"before--though not quite so much as at first,--for he thought he had"
15226,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"loaded a little too heavy. There was a pain in his shoulder yet, and he"
15227,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,did not care to be hit that way again. He rammed the charge down in a
15228,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"great hurry, looked in the pan to see if the priming was all right, and"
15229,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,then went softly towards the owl.
15230,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15231,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,When Ephraim got near the owl turned his head first to one side and
15232,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"then to the other, as if he suspected there was a boy in the woods,"
15233,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"somewhere; but he did not fly, and, nervous with haste, Ephraim found"
15234,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"another rest, and again took good aim."
15235,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15236,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Strange to say that gun hit him again. He even rolled upon the ground,"
15237,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,feeling as if he had got a double allowance of pain. Just as soon
15238,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"as he could think at all, he decided that he wouldn’t fire that gun"
15239,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"again. Of course he had killed the owl (a very reasonable supposition,"
15240,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"considering how hard the gun had hit him), and he guessed he wouldn’t"
15241,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,hunt any more that time.
15242,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15243,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,But when he looked for the owl he didn’t see him anywhere. Could it be
15244,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"that there hadn’t been any owl there? An optical illusion, he might"
15245,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"have thought, had he ever heard of such a thing. At any rate there was"
15246,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,no owl there. But he noticed something sticking in the limb where he
15247,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,thought the owl had been--and he kept his eyes on it for some time. It
15248,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,looked like the ramrod that belonged to his gun; but how in the world
15249,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,could that be?
15250,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15251,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"He looked at his gun, which was lying on the soft bed of leaves"
15252,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"where it had fallen, and then he felt sure it was the ramrod, for it"
15253,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,was gone. But how in the world?--He couldn’t understand it--till he
15254,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,happened to think that perhaps he didn’t take the ramrod out after
15255,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,loading.
15256,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15257,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“Ah! that’s it!” thought he. “But what am I going to do? It’s away up
15258,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,there and I can’t get it!” and then Ephraim began to wish he had left
15259,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the gun at home. The pain in his shoulder didn’t trouble him much
15260,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"then; his trouble was mostly in his mind, concerning his father and"
15261,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,that ramrod. How he could reconcile one to the loss of the other was
15262,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,more than he could tell.
15263,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15264,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"It was a very large tree, without a foot-hold or a finger-hold for a"
15265,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"long way up, and the ramrod was stuck in a large dead limb, ten feet"
15266,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,out. Ephraim saw at once that he never could get it; and he wished he
15267,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,hadn’t fired that last shot. Possibly he thought the owl was to blame;
15268,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,but whether he did or not there was no help for it. So after awhile he
15269,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"got up, and picked up his gun, and went slowly and sadly towards home."
15270,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15271,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,He had not decided upon any course in particular when he entered the
15272,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,house. It was one of those cases the explanation of which must be left
15273,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,largely to the circumstances of the moment.
15274,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15275,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,His mother met him with the gun in his hand.
15276,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15277,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Ephraim!” said she astonished, and too frightened to say more."
15278,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15279,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I’ve been hunting, mother,” said Ephraim, very demurely."
15280,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15281,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Hunting, my child? Merciful Father!”"
15282,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15283,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Father didn’t know, it, mother; and I don’t want you to tell him.”"
15284,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15285,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“My son! my son! is the gun loaded?”
15286,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15287,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Not now, mother. I fired it off.”"
15288,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15289,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“For pity’s sake, Ephraim! don’t ever take it out again.”"
15290,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15291,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“You won’t tell father, if I won’t take it again, will you, mother?”"
15292,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15293,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“You’ll promise me, Ephraim, that you will never take it again?”"
15294,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15295,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Yes, mother, if you won’t tell him.”"
15296,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15297,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Then put it where it belongs,--just as you found it. It’s a wonder you"
15298,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,didn’t get hurt.”
15299,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15300,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Ephraim might have said that he was a little hurt; for he had a sore
15301,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"and swollen shoulder; but he said nothing of that, nor of the ramrod;"
15302,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,but he tried to be as good a boy as he could all the rest of the day.
15303,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15304,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"The captain was late home that night, and did not notice anything"
15305,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"wrong; but the next day, while at his desk, his eyes fell upon his old"
15306,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"training-gun, and he saw that the ramrod was missing. He mused upon"
15307,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,it. Where could it be? He never lent that gun; nobody had had it out of
15308,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the house that he knew of. He went and asked his wife.
15309,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15310,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,Ephraim happened to be with his mother; and when his father asked about
15311,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,the ramrod he looked at her and she looked at him. One or the other of
15312,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"them must let the cat out, but which should it be?"
15313,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15314,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Do you know anything about the ramrod, Ephraim?” she asked."
15315,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15316,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I went a-hunting, father,” said Ephraim, looking down."
15317,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15318,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“A-hunting? Who--what--when? You have not been shooting that gun, have"
15319,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,you?”
15320,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15321,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Yes, sir.”"
15322,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15323,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“Goodness! Who loaded it?”
15324,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15325,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“I--did--sir.”
15326,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15327,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“And fired it off?”
15328,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15329,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“Yes, sir.”"
15330,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15331,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,“Did you kill anything?”
15332,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15333,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"“I--don’t know,--sir.”"
15334,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15335,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"After all, the captain couldn’t help laughing at this point, and as"
15336,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"soon as he did Ephraim felt better. He brightened up in a moment, and"
15337,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,made the best of his father’s good-nature by telling the whole story at
15338,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"once. He had forgotten to take the ramrod out, he said, and fired it at"
15339,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"the owl. He guessed the owl went off to die somewhere, for he didn’t"
15340,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,see him again; but the ramrod was up so high he couldn’t get it.
15341,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15342,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"The captain laughed; still, the view he took of the matter was an"
15343,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,unpleasantly serious one for Ephraim; who understood that if he should
15344,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,ever take that gun again in his father’s absence the consequences
15345,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"would be direful. The gun was no gun without a ramrod, in his father’s"
15346,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"trained eyes, so he at once set out, with Ephraim as guide, and the"
15347,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"hired man carrying a ladder, to recover it."
15348,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15349,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"Ephraim led them straight to the tree, and there the ramrod was, still"
15350,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"sticking in the limb. But the ladder proved too short, and they had"
15351,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"to go back without it. The next day they went again, with the longest"
15352,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,"ladder on the farm, and got the ramrod and carried it home."
15353,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,
15354,BY J. H. WOODBURY.,But Ephraim never fired it off again.

15374,BY S. K. B.,"as in fig. 1. Next paint the whites of the eyes with solid white, and"
15375,BY S. K. B.,the lips a bright vermilion. Then go over your outlines with black
15376,BY S. K. B.,"paint or India ink, filling the eyeball with black. Use water-color"

15381,BY S. K. B.,"necessary articles, you will cut a piece of bright-colored paper after"
15382,BY S. K. B.,"the fashion of fig. 2. If you please, you can decorate it with a heavy"
15383,BY S. K. B.,"line of black paint. Its pieces 1, 2, 3 and 4, are to be bent tightly"
15384,BY S. K. B.,"up at the dotted line, so as to receive a decided crease. Then each one"
15385,BY S. K. B.,"may be touched with stiff paste, slipped within the shell and fastened."
15386,BY S. K. B.,"Then the strip must be pasted together at A and B, drawing one end over"

15407,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"On the Capitoline Hill, in Rome, stands a church, twelve hundred years"
15408,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"old, called Ara Cœli. It is unpromising in its outward appearance, but"
15409,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,is rich in marbles and mosaics within.

15413,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"The most precious possession of this ancient church, however, is a"
15414,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,wooden doll called Il Santissimo Bambino--The Most Holy Infant. It is
15415,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"dressed like an Italian baby, and an Italian baby is dressed like a"
15416,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"mummy. We often see them in their mothers’ arms, so swathed that they"
15417,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,can no more move than a bundle without any baby inside of it. Their
15418,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,little legs must ache for the freedom of kicking. The dress of _the_
15419,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Bambino is very different from that of _a_ bambino after all, for it is"
15420,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"cloth of silver, and it sparkles all over with jewels which have been"
15421,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"presented to it, and it wears a golden crown upon its head."

15423,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"This is the history of this remarkable doll, as devout Roman Catholics"
15424,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,believe. You must judge for yourselves how much of it is truth and how
15425,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,much fable.

15427,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,They say this image of the infant Saviour was carved from olive-wood
15428,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"which grew upon the Mount of Olives, by a monk who lived in Palestine;"
15429,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"and, as he had no means of painting it with sufficient beauty, his"
15430,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,prayers prevailed upon St. Luke to come down from Heaven and color
15431,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,it for him. Then he sent it to Rome to be present at the Christmas
15432,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"festival. It was shipwrecked on the way, but finally came safely to"
15433,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"land, and was received with great reverence by the Franciscan monks,"
15434,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,who placed it in a shrine at Ara Cœli. It was soon found to have
15435,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"miraculous power to heal the sick, and was so often sent for to visit"
15436,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"them, that, at one time, it received more fees than any physician in"

15441,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,could get possession of this wonder-working image for herself and her
15442,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,friends.
15443,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15444,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,“She had another doll prepared of the same size and appearance as the
15445,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"‘Santissimo,’ and having feigned sickness and obtained permission to"
15446,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"have it left with her, she dressed the false image in its clothes, and"
15447,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"sent it back to Ara Cœli. The fraud was not discovered till night,"
15448,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,when the Franciscan monks were awakened by the most furious ringing
15449,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"of bells and by thundering knocks at the west door of the church,"
15450,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"and, hastening thither, could see nothing but a wee, naked, pink"
15451,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"foot peeping in from under the door; but when they opened the door,"
15452,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"without stood the little naked figure of the true Bambino of Ara Cœli,"
15453,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,shivering in the wind and rain. So the false baby was sent back in
15454,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"disgrace, and the real baby restored to its home, never to be trusted"
15455,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,away alone any more.”
15456,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15457,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,This marvelous escape is duly recorded in the Sacristy of the church
15458,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"where the Bambino safely dwells under lock and key all the year, except"
15459,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the time from Christmas to Epiphany, when it comes out to receive the"
15460,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,homage of the people.
15461,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15462,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,We went to see it last Christmas.
15463,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15464,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"As I told you, the church stands on one of the Seven Hills of the"
15465,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,Eternal City; it is approached by a flight of stone steps as wide as
15466,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,the building itself and as high as the hill. There were many beggars on
15467,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"these steps; some old and blind, others young and bright-eyed. Beside"
15468,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the beggars, there were people with tiny images of the Baby in the"
15469,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Manger, toy sheep, and pictures of the Bambino for sale."
15470,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15471,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"When we went into the church, we found one of the chapels fitted up"
15472,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,like a tableau. The chapels are something like large alcoves along
15473,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the sides of a church. Each is consecrated to some saint, and often"
15474,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,belongs to some particular family who have their weddings and funerals
15475,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,there.
15476,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15477,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,[Illustration: FAMILY OF ROMAN BEGGARS.]
15478,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15479,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,It was in the second chapel on the left that we found the scene
15480,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"represented. The Virgin Mary was dressed in a bright blue silk, adorned"
15481,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"with various jewels. In her lap lay the Bambino, about the size of a"
15482,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"baby six weeks old. I do not believe St. Luke painted its face, for"
15483,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,it was not half so well done as most of the wooden dolls we see. An
15484,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"artificial mule had his nose close to the baby’s head. Joseph sat near,"
15485,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,and in front the shepherds were kneeling. All these people were of
15486,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"life-size, made of wood, and dressed in real clothes. Beyond them was"
15487,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"to be seen a pretty landscape--sheep, covered with real wool, a girl"
15488,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,with a pitcher on her head coming down a path to a sparkling fountain
15489,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,of _glass_. In the distance was the town of Bethlehem. In mid-air
15490,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"hovered an angel, hung by a wire in his back from the ceiling. On"
15491,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"pasteboard screens, above the Virgin and Child were painted a crowd of"
15492,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"cherubs looking down, and in their midst God the Father--whom no one"
15493,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,hath seen nor can see--was represented in the likeness of a venerable
15494,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"man, spreading his hands in blessing over the group below."
15495,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15496,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,A great many little children were coming with the older people to look
15497,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"at all this, and talking, in their pretty Italian tongue, about the"
15498,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,“Bambino.”
15499,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15500,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Epiphany, as perhaps you know, is the day kept in memory of the visit"
15501,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,of the Wise Men whom the Star in the East guided to our Saviour’s
15502,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"cradle. On that day, Il Santissimo Bambino was to be carried with all"
15503,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,ceremony back to the Sacristy; so we went to see that.
15504,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15505,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,We were glad to find the Blessed Virgin had two nice silk dresses; she
15506,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"had changed from blue to red, and the Bambino was standing on her knee."
15507,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"The Shepherds had gone, and the Wise Men had come, all very gorgeous"
15508,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"in flowered brocade and cloth of gold, with crowns on their heads, and"
15509,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,pages to hold their trains.
15510,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15511,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,It was yet an hour or two before the “Procession of the Holy Cradle”
15512,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,would proceed; so we went out of the side door of the church to stray
15513,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,about the Capitoline Hill in the meanwhile.
15514,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15515,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"We went down the steps where Tiberias Gracchus, the friend of the"
15516,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"people, was killed, some two thousand years ago. That brought us into"
15517,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,a small square called Piazza di Campidoglio. It is surrounded on three
15518,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"sides by public buildings, and in front has a grand stairway leading"
15519,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,down to the street. It was in this very spot that Brutus made his
15520,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,famous speech after the assassination of Julius Cæsar. We crossed the
15521,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"square, went up some steps and through an archway."
15522,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15523,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"A company of little Romans were playing soldier there, and the small"
15524,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,drum-major made the walls of the capitol resound with his rattling
15525,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,music. That reminds me to tell you that Santa Claus does not visit
15526,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Italy; but an old woman, named Navona, comes instead. She may be his"
15527,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"wife, for aught I know; in fact, it seems quite likely, for she has a"
15528,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"way, just like his, of coming down the chimney, bringing gifts for the"
15529,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,good children and switches for the naughty. These must have been very
15530,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"good little boys, for every one of them seemed to have a new sword or"
15531,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,gun. Probably Navona has to keep the house while Santa Claus is away
15532,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"about his Christmas business, and that is the reason she does not reach"
15533,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"her small people here until the night before Epiphany, the 6th of"
15534,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,January.
15535,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15536,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"We went down a lane of poor houses, dodging the clothes which hung"
15537,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"drying over our heads, and came to a large green gate in the high"
15538,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"stone wall of a garden. We knocked, but no one answered. Presently a"
15539,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"black-eyed little boy came running to us, glad to earn two or three"
15540,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"sous by going to call the _custode_. While we wait for him to do so,"
15541,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,I must tell you why we wished to go through this green door. You have
15542,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"read, either in Latin or English, the story of Tarpæia, the Roman"
15543,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"maiden, who consented to show the Latin soldiers the way into the"
15544,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"citadel if they would give her what they wore on their left arms,"
15545,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"meaning their bracelets, and then the grim joke they played after she"
15546,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"had done her part, by throwing upon her their shields, which were also"
15547,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,“what they wore on their left arms.”
15548,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15549,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"It was to see the Tarpæian rock, where she led her country’s enemies"
15550,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"up, and where, later, traitors were hurled down, that we wished to"
15551,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"go through the gate. Presently the keeper came, a rosy young woman,"
15552,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"leading a little girl, who was feeling very rich over a new dolly she"
15553,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,was dangling by its arm.
15554,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15555,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"We were admitted to a small garden, where pretty pink roses were in"
15556,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"blossom, and the oranges were hanging on the trees, though the icicles"
15557,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"were fringing the fountain not far away. On the edge of the garden,"
15558,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"along the brow of the cliff, runs a thick wall of brown stone; we"
15559,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,leaned over it and looked down the steep rock which one assaulting
15560,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"party after another tried, in old times, to scale."
15561,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15562,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,It was on this side that the Gauls were trying to reach the citadel at
15563,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the time the geese saved the city. Do you know that for a long time,"
15564,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"annually, a dog was crucified on the capitol, and a goose carried in"
15565,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"triumph, because, on that occasion, the dogs failed to give the alarm"
15566,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,and the geese did it!
15567,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15568,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,We looked down on the roofs and into the courts of poor houses which
15569,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"have huddled close about the foot of the hill, but beyond them we"
15570,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"could look down into the Forum, where Virginia was stabbed, where"
15571,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Horatius hung up the spoil of the Curiatii, where the body of Julius"
15572,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Cæsar was burned, where the head of Cicero was cruelly exposed on the"
15573,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,very rostrum where had often been seen the triumph of his eloquence.
15574,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Opposite to us stood the Palatine Hill, a mass of crumbling palaces;"
15575,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"a little farther off rose the mighty wall of the Coliseum, where the"
15576,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"gladiators used to fight, and where so many Christian martyrs were"
15577,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"thrown to the wild beasts while tens of thousands of their fellow-men,"
15578,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"more cruel than lions, looked on, for sport."
15579,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15580,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Just at the roots of the Capitoline, close by, though out of sight, was"
15581,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the Mamertine Prison, where St. Paul, of whom the world was not worthy,"
15582,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,was once shut up in the dismal darkness of the dungeon.
15583,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15584,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"As we went from the garden back to the Piazza di Campidoglio, we"
15585,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,saw something unusual was going on in the palace on the left of the
15586,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,capital. In the door stood a guard in resplendent array of crimson
15587,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"and gold lace. Looking through the arched entrance, we could see in"
15588,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,the inner court an open carriage with driver and footman in livery of
15589,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,bright scarlet. Something of a crowd was gathering in the corridors.
15590,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"We stopped to learn what it was all about. An Italian woman answered,"
15591,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,“La Principessa Margarita!” and an English lady close by explained that
15592,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the Princess Margaret, wife of the crown prince, had come to distribute"
15593,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,prizes to the children of the public schools. Only invited guests could
15594,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"be present, but the people were waiting to see her come down. So we"
15595,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,joined the people and waited also.
15596,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15597,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,It was a long time and a pretty cold one. A brass band in the court
15598,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,cheered our spirits now and then. The fine span of the princess looked
15599,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"rather excited, at first, by the trumpets so close to their ears,"
15600,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,but they stood their ground bravely. If one of the scarlet footmen
15601,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"tightened a buckle, it raised our hopes that his mistress was coming;"
15602,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the other put a fresh cigar in his mouth, and they sank."
15603,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15604,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,[Illustration: THE EQUIPAGE OF THE BAMBINO.--Page 76.]
15605,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15606,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,Meantime the guard in the gold-laced crimson coat and yellow silk
15607,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,stockings paced up and down. At length there was a messenger from
15608,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,above; the royal carriage drove under the arch close to us. There was
15609,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"a rustle, and down came the princely lady, dressed in purple velvet,"
15610,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"with mauve feathers in her hat, a white veil drawn over her face, and"
15611,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"a large bouquet in her white-gloved hand--rather pretty, and very"
15612,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"graceful. Before entering her carriage, she turned to shake hands"
15613,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,with the ladies and gentlemen who had accompanied her. She was very
15614,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"complaisant, bowing low to them, and they still lower to her. Then"
15615,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"she bowed graciously to the crowd right and left, and they responded"
15616,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"gratefully. She smiled upon them, high and low, but there was a look in"
15617,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"her face, as it passed close to me, as if she was tired of smiling for"
15618,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,the public. She seated herself in the carriage; the lady-in-waiting
15619,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"took her place beside her, the gentleman-in-waiting threw over them the"
15620,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,carriage-robe of white ermine lined with light blue velvet and stepped
15621,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,in himself.
15622,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15623,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Then the equipage rolled off, the scarlet footmen getting up behind as"
15624,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"it started. This princess is very good and kind, greatly beloved by"
15625,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the people, and, as there is no queen, she is the first lady in the"
15626,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,kingdom. Her husband first and her little son next are heirs to the
15627,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,crown.
15628,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15629,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"This show being over, we hastened back to the church, fearing we had"
15630,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,missed the Bambino in our pursuit of the princess. But we were in good
15631,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"time. On the side of the church opposite the tableau was a small,"
15632,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"temporary platform. Little boys and girls were placed upon this, one"
15633,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"after the other, to speak short pieces or recite verses about the"
15634,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,Infant Christ. It was a kind of Sunday-school concert in Italian. The
15635,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,language is very sweet in a child’s mouth. There were a great many
15636,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"bright, black-eyed children in the church, and most of them seemed to"
15637,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"have brought their Christmas presents along with them, as if to show"
15638,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,them to the Bambino.
15639,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15640,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"There were ragged men in the crowd, and monks, and country-women with"
15641,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,handkerchiefs tied over their heads for bonnets. One of them who stood
15642,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,near me had her first finger covered with rings up to the last joint.
15643,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,That is their great ambition in the way of dress.
15644,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15645,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"At length the organ ceased playing, and the notes of a military band"
15646,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"were heard. Then we saw a banner moving slowly down one of the aisles,"
15647,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,followed by a train of lighted tapers. Over the heads of the people
15648,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,we could only see the banner and the lights; they passed down and
15649,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,paused to take the Bambino. Then they marched slowly all around the
15650,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,church--people falling on their knees as they passed by.
15651,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15652,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Out at the front door they went, and that sacred image was held high"
15653,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"aloft, so that all the people on the great stairway and in the square"
15654,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"below might get a sight of it, and be blessed. Then up the middle of"
15655,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"the church they came, to the high altar. This was our chance to see"
15656,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,them perfectly.
15657,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15658,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"First the banner, with an image of the Virgin on it, was borne by"
15659,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,a young priest dressed in a long black robe and a white short gown
15660,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,trimmed with lace; next came a long procession of men in ordinary
15661,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"dress, carrying long and large wax candles, which they had a"
15662,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,disagreeable habit or dripping as they went along.
15663,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15664,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"“Servants of great houses,” remarked a lady behind me."
15665,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15666,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"“They used to come themselves,” answered another."
15667,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,
15668,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"Then followed Franciscan monks in their brown copes, each with a"
15669,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"knotted rope for a girdle, and sandals only on his bare feet. After"
15670,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"these came the band of musicians, all little boys; and now approached,"
15671,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"with measured tread, three priests in rich robes of white brocade,"
15672,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"enriched with silver. The middle one, a tall, venerable-looking man,"
15673,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"with hoary hair and solemn countenance, held erect in his hands the"
15674,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"sacred dolly. As it passed, believers dropped upon their knees. When he"
15675,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,"reached the high altar, he reverently kissed its feet, and delivered it"
15676,IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.,to its custodian to be carried to the Sacristy!

15716,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15717,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Before I was to go, however, there was ever so much other New Year"
15718,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,delight to keep the time from seeming long. Father and Andrew were
15719,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"going down to the whip-factory in Dock square, to choose for Andrew the"
15720,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"longest-lashed toy-whip, with the gayest snapper and the handsomest"
15721,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"handle, that he could pick out there. And afterward they were going to"
15722,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"a great toy-shop, to buy me the wax doll I had been promised."
15723,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15724,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I did not care to choose my doll, as Andrew would choose his whip. I"
15725,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,had a kind of real little-mother feeling about that. I would rather
15726,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"have what came to me, what my father brought me. I wanted it to be mine"
15727,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"from the first minute I saw it, without any doubt, or any chance to"
15728,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"choose otherwise. If I had looked and hesitated among dozens of them,"
15729,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"and picked out one, I should always have felt as if I had left some"
15730,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"child behind that maybe ought to have been mine, and that I had not"
15731,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"quite _whole_ chosen any one. So I was content to stay with my mother,"
15732,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,and run down from her with the quarter and half dollars to the watchman
15733,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"and the carrier and the scavenger and the milkman, when they came with"
15734,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,their expectation of a little present. What dear old simple days those
15735,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"were, when we had a family regard for our milkman, our watchman, our"
15736,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,scavenger!

15738,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Meanwhile, I was to be dressed."
15739,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15740,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I had just got on my blue morocco slippers, that looked so funny with"
15741,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"my striped dark calico morning-frock, when the bell, that I thought I"
15742,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"had done answering with the silver fees, rang loudly again. Marcella,"
15743,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"our housemaid, called me from the foot of the nursery stairs."
15744,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15745,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“It’s somebody for you, Miss Emmeline,” she said, and I thought she"

15747,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"wallet father had filled for me, and ran down. But it was the tall"
15748,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,black servant from the Hunters. And he had in his hand a pretty paper
15749,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,box tied with a silk cord.
15750,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15751,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Mrs. Hunter’s compliments and love, miss, to you and to your ma; and"

15754,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15755,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I took the box, made a little courtesy to him, and said, “Please thank"
15756,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Mrs. Hunter, and say I wish her a happy New Year, and here’s a happy"
15757,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,New Year for you.” For I thought he couldn’t help seeing the silver
15758,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"quarter, and thinking it was for him; and father had told me to “use my"
15759,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"judgment,” and I certainly wanted to give it to him the minute I saw"
15760,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,he had come all the way with a present for me. Elizabeth and I liked
15761,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,Jefferson very much; he gave us macaroons and prunes and almonds from
15762,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"the pantry, and he swung us in the swing in the great drying-room. He"
15763,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"made me a fine bow, and thanked me, and said he should keep my quarter"
15764,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,for luck.
15765,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15766,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"So I ran up to my mother, and kissed her--for somehow whenever anything"
15767,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,pleasant came to me I always kissed my mother--and we opened the box.
15768,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"It was a beautiful blue silk braid net, with a long blue ribbon run"

15771,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“O, mother!” I cried, “it’s a _long_ ribbon, for flying ends!” I was so"
15772,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,glad; for I had no curls like Elizabeth’s and I thought flying ribbons
15773,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"would seem like them a little, and I had never worn any."
15774,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15775,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“It is very pretty,” said my mother; “but I think, dear, with your"

15777,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15778,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"She did not tell me that my face was narrow and my nose was long, and"
15779,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"that I couldn’t possibly look like Elizabeth Hunter, even with flying"

15782,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15783,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I was disappointed; too disappointed to say anything; and before I
15784,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"spoke, mother, who had put the net over my hair, and drawn the ribbon,"
15785,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"tied a butterfly bow with it over my left ear, and snipped the ends"
15786,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,into short dovetails with her small bright toilet scissors.
15787,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15788,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I choked a little in my throat, and the tears came into my eyes."
15789,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15790,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Did you care so much?” asked mother tenderly, and kissed me again."
15791,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“But it is a _great deal_ prettier for you so; trust me, dear.”"
15792,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15793,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I did not speak then, for I couldn’t; but I tried to swallow the choke"
15794,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"and the tears; mother who was always kind, had been so dearly kind"
15795,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"to me that day. And Andrew came running up the stairs just then, and"
15796,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"bounced in at the door; and there was my dear wax-baby in his arms, and"
15797,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I was a happy little mother; and what happy little mother, with her"

15799,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15800,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,The baby was dressed in a pretty white slip and a bib; and there was a

15803,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“There were dollies a good deal older, and some all grown up,” said"

15807,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"whence it trailed behind him, and cracked it gloriously with its yellow"

15809,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15810,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“O, And! Be careful! Give her right to me. Boys don’t know how to tend"

15813,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Guess I am! Brought her right straight along, and didn’t care a mite,"

15817,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15818,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I put my arms round his neck, and hugged him and the baby and the whip"
15819,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"all together; for my Andie always was a hero, and loved me. He brought"
15820,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"me my greatest gift pleasures, and my happiest surprises. Father"
15821,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"always took him into the plan, if Andie hadn’t already begged it for"
15822,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"me,--whenever there was one. I think our parents had that notion about"
15823,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"son and daughter, and what the little man and woman should be to each"
15824,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"other. Mother used to set me to do all the little cheery, comfortable"
15825,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,home-things for Andie. Andie brought me my wax doll when I was seven
15826,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"years old; he walked down to Jones’s, with father, the day he was"
15827,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"seventeen, and brought me home my real, gold watch. I always mended"
15828,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Andie’s stockings after I was old enough,--and quite little girls were"
15829,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,old enough in those days; and I made pan ginger-bread for his supper
15830,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,when he was coming home cold from coasting on the Common; and I read
15831,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,to him when he was sick with sore throat and saved money to fill his
15832,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,bag with white alleys when marble-time came round. Andie and I used to
15833,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"promise never to get married, but to keep house with each other when we"
15834,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,were grown up. I have never got married; but Andie has been lying in

15836,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15837,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,My mother hurried me a little now; for Marcella was ready.

15839,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"We walked down across the Common, Marcella and I; she was to leave me"

15842,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"pelisse with gray fur cape and border,--my quilted bonnet edged with"

15845,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I was perfectly happy till Mrs. Hunter unfastened my things by the

15853,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15854,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Why, where are the long ends?” she said. And then I immediately felt"
15855,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"as if all there was of me was that one little, short-chopped, butterfly"

15857,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15858,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Mother thought--” I began, and there stopped. My lips trembled a"

15860,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15861,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Mrs. Hunter looked sorry. “Was she _quite_ particular?” she asked,"
15862,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"after an instant. “Because I have another ribbon. Just for _to-day_,"
15863,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"perhaps, because you like to be like Lizzie? It would be a pity not"
15864,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"to please the child,” she said to Mrs. Marchand, her sister, who was"
15865,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"there. She was drawing the blue ribbon from her pretty round, carved"
15866,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"worktable, and she put out her hand to untie my little bow."
15867,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15868,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Then it came over me. I started back. “Please! No! Please not, Mrs."

15871,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15872,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I wouldn’t have had that bow with the dovetailed ends untied, that"

15874,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15875,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"A singular expression, I thought, passed between the faces of the two"

15877,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"me to her again, and kissed me. “You are a dear little thing,” she said"
15878,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"to me. “The little souls know best,” she said to her sister."
15879,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15880,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,“When the little souls are--” but Mrs. Marchand did not say what.
15881,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15882,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I wondered why Mrs. Hunter, while she praised me,--but it was not"

15884,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"pitied me so. I couldn’t think it was for the sake of the ribbon. No,"

15886,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15887,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"We had a beautiful time. Of course I had brought my baby, and I"

15896,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15897,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I was very happy. There was a hidden corner in my heart that kept
15898,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"warming up every now and then, as if mother and I had a secret"
15899,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"together, and we were whispering it to each other across the wide, cold"
15900,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,city. Elizabeth’s pretty hair and long blue ribbons flew this way and
15901,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,that in the merry play and running; and I noticed them just as I always
15902,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"had, and I knew that there was nothing pretty about my short, plain,"
15903,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"light-colored hair, and I _did_ think that flying ends would have been"
15904,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,a comfort if I could have had them in the first place; but there was
15905,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,something beyond comfort in the loyalty of wearing that butterfly bow
15906,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"which nobody need touch or try to change for me, since--because she"

15956,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,from this day forward as long as you and my wife shall live.” He
15957,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"fell, unpremeditatedly, into the words of the Solemn Service that had"
15958,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"been spoken over them; it was as if he had married us two, in our new"
15959,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"relation, to each other."
15960,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15961,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,He said to Andrew--“My boy knows what men owe to women; he and I must
15962,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,do our best and manliest for these two. We four are a family now.”
15963,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15964,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,The new wife stretched out a hand to each of us. She slipped her arm
15965,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"round me, and drew me to her side, while she held Andrew’s hand upon"
15966,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,her knee. The face that looked into mine was very wistful and kind; it
15967,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,almost seemed to beseech something of me. It asked leave to be loving.
15968,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15969,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,We children did not know what to say. I felt uneasy not to speak at
15970,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"all. I believe I smiled a little, shyly. Then I asked--"
15971,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15972,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“What shall I call you, please?”"
15973,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15974,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“What shall they call you, Lucy?” asked my father."
15975,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15976,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Call me ‘step-mamma,’” was the answer; and I think he was utterly"
15977,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,surprised.
15978,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15979,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“I will not take their mother’s name away,” she said. “I will not be"
15980,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"_instead_ of her. I will be called just what I want to be; a step, a"
15981,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"link, between her and them. I will try and do _for_ her what she would"
15982,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,have done if she had stayed.”
15983,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15984,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Then I think I’ll call you ‘For-mamma,’” said straight-spoken Andrew."
15985,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,“I think that will do very well.”
15986,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15987,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"We all laughed; and it relieved the feeling. “Thank you, Andrew,” said"
15988,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,our step-mamma. “That is a great help at the very beginning. I believe
15989,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,we shall understand each other.”
15990,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15991,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"For my part I only kissed her. By the way she kissed me back, I knew it"
15992,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,was her first act “for” my mother.
15993,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
15994,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"So we began to love her, and we called her “step-mamma.” People thought"
15995,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"it very odd, and we never explained it to them. We let our relation"
15996,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"explain itself. But _among_ ourselves, the familiar, privileged,"
15997,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,lovely name was “For-mamma.” That we kept this sign through so many
15998,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"years,--the years of our troublesome, probative childhood,--tells more"
15999,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,than any story of the years could tell.
16000,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16001,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I only wanted to say a little bit of what she was to me at seventeen;
16002,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"and how my mother’s very words came again to me through her, as by an"
16003,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,accepted mediation.
16004,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16005,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I went with her to a large party; my very first large grown-up party.
16006,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16007,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"My old friend, Elizabeth Hunter, was a bride this winter. I had been"
16008,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"bridesmaid at her wedding; that was the beginning of my coming out,"
16009,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,earlier than I should otherwise have done.
16010,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16011,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"What a plain little bridesmaid I had been, to what an exquisite vision"
16012,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"of a bride! I remember thinking as we, the bridal party, walked through"
16013,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"the long rooms, when all was gay, and ceremony was broken through at"
16014,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,supper-time--when the rooms rustled with the turning of the groups
16015,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,to look after her and the murmur went along about her beauty--“What
16016,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"difference ought it to make, that _she_ is the beauty, and that I can"
16017,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"never be,--so long as the beauty _is_ and we all feel it?” Yet the"
16018,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"strange difference was there, and the cross of my beauty-loving nature"
16019,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"was that I in my own being and movement, could never hold and represent"
16020,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,it.
16021,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16022,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I looked at myself when I had dressed for this large party. The lovely
16023,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,blue silk--the delicate lace--the white roses--they almost achieved
16024,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,prettiness enough of themselves; and I suppose I looked as nice as I
16025,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"could; but there were still the too prominent brows, the nose too big"
16026,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"for the eyes, the lips too easily parted over the teeth fine and white,"
16027,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"but contributing to the excess of profile, or middle-face, that had"
16028,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,made me call it Rocky-Mountain outline when I was a child.
16029,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16030,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I went down to my step-mamma’s room. She, in her ruby-colored satin,"
16031,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,was fairer at thirty-eight than I at seventeen. I sat watching her as
16032,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,she put pearl earrings into her ears.
16033,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16034,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“For-mamma,” I said, “I don’t believe I shall ever care much for"

16036,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,think it is only pretty people who can enjoy them much.”
16037,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16038,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"She laid down the second pearl hoop on the table, and came to me."
16039,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16040,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"“Emmie,” she said, “I know it is a hard thing for a woman who loves all"

16042,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"made you very beautiful, in mere features. But can’t you wear a plain"
16043,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"face awhile, because He has given it to you to wear, and trust to Him"
16044,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,to make it lovely in his way and season?”
16045,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16046,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"My step-mamma hardly ever said anything so direct as this to me, about"
16047,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"religion. She only lived her religion in a pleasant, comfortable,"
16048,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"unassuming way, and kept a light shining by which I saw--without her"
16049,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,flashing it upon me like a dark-lantern--into any little selfish
16050,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"or God-forgetful course of my own life. Now, these words came to"
16051,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"me--across ten years--the very words said to me in that same room, at"
16052,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,that same hour of night.... Why--it was the very night! We were going
16053,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,to a New Year’s party.
16054,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16055,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"A great heart-beat came up in my throat, and the tears pressed up"
16056,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"together into face and eyes, while I felt the kindling of my own look,"
16057,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,and saw what it must be by the answering color and the light in hers.
16058,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16059,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I put my hands out and reached them round her waist as she stood close
16060,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"to me in her beautiful glowing dress, under which a more beautiful"
16061,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"heart was glowing brighter. “I cannot tell you two apart, Mamma and"
16062,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,For-mamma!” I said.
16063,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16064,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,We went together to the party. For-mamma had to put her one pearl hoop
16065,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"in her pocket after she got there, for she had forgotten the other"
16066,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,on her dressing table. And what that party was to me I wonder if any
16067,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"grand, lovely, tender church-service ever was to anybody, more or"
16068,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,better!
16069,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16070,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I had a quiet time, compared to some girls who were always rushed"
16071,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"after, and rushing through the gay dances. I was politely asked, and I"
16072,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,did dance; but not every time; that was as it always was with me. But
16073,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,all the beauty and all the gladness in the whole room was mine; for it
16074,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"was all “the dear Lord’s,” and He was giving it as He would. “Passing"
16075,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"it round,” I couldn’t help thinking--was it irreverent, I wonder--as"
16076,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"the sweet, rich confections were passed round, that were meant, a"
16077,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"share in turn, for all. My turn would come. And for my plain, still,"
16078,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"Rocky-Mountain face that I was wearing now,--there was a secret between"
16079,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,me and some Heart that thought of me across whatever cold and emptiness
16080,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"of wintry way might seem to lie between, like that which had been when"
16081,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,in my childish disappointment I wore the simple bit of ribbon that “my

16086,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,There came a time when I had to give up other beauty. To recognise that
16087,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"it was not for me,--yet. Not in all this long, waiting world, as other"
16088,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,people have it. That was harder; yet it was all one. It seemed to me
16089,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,that some people were given at their birth a kind of ticket that opened
16090,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"to them all paradises; and that others were thrust forth, unaccredited,"
16091,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"into a life whose most beautiful doors would be shut, one after"

16095,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16096,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I had to content myself with a fate like my face; a plain pleasantness
16097,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"without great, wonderful delight. A Rocky-Mountain aspect of living,"
16098,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"that seemed hard and rough until I got into the heart of it, and let it"
16099,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"shut out the fair champaigns, and then it showed me its own depth, and"
16100,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"height, and glory."
16101,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16102,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"There was one long, heavy time when For-mamma and I were separated"
16103,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"for years. For-mamma was a widow, now; we four that had been a family"
16104,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"together were we two here and they two there; they _three_, in the"
16105,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"other home. And my grandmother, in her feeble, querulous, uncomfortable"
16106,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"old age, had nobody to come and live with her and “see her through,” as"
16107,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"she said. At nearly the same time, For-mamma’s sister died, and there"
16108,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,were five little children to be cared for. I thought she would never
16109,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"get away from that duty, though mine might see an end. But a new wife"
16110,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"came there after a good while, as For-mamma--I _hope_ it was as she"
16111,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"came--had come to us; and then grandmother died, and nobody could say"
16112,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,otherwise than that it was a release. I did not say so; I hate to hear
16113,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,people say that; it is so apt to mean a release for those who outlive.
16114,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"There are long dyings, and brief ones; when it is over, we go back to"
16115,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,the well time to measure our loss. Grandmother’s dying began almost
16116,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"twenty years before, when her nerves gave out, and her comfort in"
16117,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"living was over, and people began to lose patience with her. I looked"
16118,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"back to that time, and thought what a bright handsome woman, fond of"
16119,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"her own way but with such a fine capable way, I could recollect her."
16120,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16121,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,I had tried to do my duty; it was a piece of life that the same
16122,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,Love had put on me that I had learned--a little--to believe in as a
16123,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"mother’s; and now it was over--“through,” and For-mamma and I came"

16126,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"I suppose everybody thinks we are very fortunate people, and perfectly"

16128,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"that can be done with money, for ourselves and for others. I suppose"
16129,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,many persons think that my five years with Grandmother Cumberland were
16130,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,paid for in the fifty thousand dollars that she left me. I know that
16131,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"they were paid for as they went along, and as I found myself able and"

16133,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,
16134,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,For-mamma and I _are_ happy; I do not think we shall ever leave each
16135,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,other now so long as we both may live. I often think how my father

16138,BY MRS. A. D. T. WHITNEY.,"We have a lovely and dear home, and friends to fill it when we want"

16172,PART I.,We lived in that same Casa Guidi from whose windows Elizabeth Barrett
16173,PART I.,Browning’s poet-eyes saw what she afterward put into glowing verse.
16174,PART I.,"Casa Guidi is a great pile of graystone, a pile of many windows which"
16175,PART I.,"give upon the Via Maggio and a little piazza, as the squares in"
16176,PART I.,Florence are called. Consequently it is lighter and brighter than are
16177,PART I.,"many of the houses in Florence, where the streets are narrow and the"
16178,PART I.,houses lofty.
16179,PART I.,
16180,PART I.,"According to almost universal custom, Casa Guidi was divided into half"
16181,PART I.,"a dozen different apartments, occupied by as many families. Ours was"
16182,PART I.,"on the second floor, on the side of the house overlooking the piazza"
16183,PART I.,on which stood the church of San Felice. The pleasantest room in our
16184,PART I.,"apartment, as I thought, was a room in which I passed many hours of"
16185,PART I.,"an ailing childhood; a room which I christened “The Gallery,” because"
16186,PART I.,"it was long and narrow, and was hung with many cheerful pictures."
16187,PART I.,"It opened into a little boudoir at one end, and into the _salon_ at"
16188,PART I.,the other. The walls of gallery and boudoir were frescoed gayly with
16189,PART I.,"fruits, and flowers, and birds."
16190,PART I.,
16191,PART I.,"Here the sun streamed in all through the long, mild, Florentine"
16192,PART I.,"winters; here I would lie on my couch, and count the roses on the"
16193,PART I.,"walls, and the birds, and the apricots, and listen to the cries in"
16194,PART I.,"the streets; and, if a procession went by, hurry to the window and"
16195,PART I.,"watch it pass, and stay at the window until I was tired, when I would"
16196,PART I.,"totter back to my couch, and my day-dreams, and my drawing, and my"
16197,PART I.,"verse-making, and my attempts at studying."
16198,PART I.,
16199,PART I.,"I was fired with artist-ambitions at the age of ten; and what wonder,"
16200,PART I.,"surrounded as I was by artists living and dead, and by their immortal"
16201,PART I.,works. It seemed to me then that one _must_ put all one’s impressions
16202,PART I.,of sight and form into shape. But I did not develop well. Noses proved
16203,PART I.,"a stumbling-block, which I never overcame, to my attaining to eminence"
16204,PART I.,in figure-sketching.
16205,PART I.,
16206,PART I.,The picture that I admired most in those days was one of Judith holding
16207,PART I.,"up the gory head of Holofernes, in the Pitti Gallery of Paintings."
16208,PART I.,"I was seized with a longing to copy it, on my return from my first"
16209,PART I.,"visit to the Gallery. I seated myself, one evening, before a sheet"
16210,PART I.,"of drawing-paper, and I tried and tried; but the nose of Holofernes"
16211,PART I.,was too much for me. All that I could accomplish was something that
16212,PART I.,"resembled an enlarged interrogation mark, and recalled Chinese Art, as"
16213,PART I.,"illustrated on fans. I was disappointed, disgusted--but, above all,"
16214,PART I.,surprised: it was my first intimation that “to do” is not “as easy as
16215,PART I.,’tis to know what ’twere good to do.”
16216,PART I.,
16217,PART I.,"In the midst of my futile efforts, a broad-shouldered, bearded man"
16218,PART I.,"was announced, who, having shaken hands with the grown-ups, came and"
16219,PART I.,"seated himself beside the little girl, and her paint-box and pencils"
16220,PART I.,and care-worn face.
16221,PART I.,
16222,PART I.,"“O, Mr. Hart,” I cried, “do make this nose for me!”"
16223,PART I.,
16224,PART I.,"Whereupon he made it, giving me many valuable suggestions, meanwhile,"
16225,PART I.,"as to the effect produced by judicious shading. Still, I was"
16226,PART I.,discouraged. It was borne in upon me that this was not _my_ branch of
16227,PART I.,art.
16228,PART I.,
16229,PART I.,[Illustration: “POSING.”]
16230,PART I.,
16231,PART I.,"“Mr. Hart,” I said, “I think I would like to make noses _your_ way.”"
16232,PART I.,
16233,PART I.,"“Would you? Then you shall. Come to my studio to-morrow, and you shall"
16234,PART I.,"have some clay and a board, and try what you can do.”"
16235,PART I.,
16236,PART I.,So the next day I insisted upon availing myself of this invitation. Mr.
16237,PART I.,"Hart was then elaborating his machine for taking portraits in marble,"
16238,PART I.,in his studio in the upper part of the city. He had always several
16239,PART I.,"busts on hand, excellent likenesses. His workmen would be employed in"
16240,PART I.,"cutting out the marble, while he molded his original thought out of the"
16241,PART I.,plastic clay. There has always been a fascination to me in statuary.
16242,PART I.,Mr. Ruskin tells us that form appealed to the old Greeks more forcibly
16243,PART I.,"than color. That was in the youth of the race; possibly, the first"
16244,PART I.,"stage of art-development is an appreciation of form; in my case, I have"
16245,PART I.,"not passed into the maturer stage yet. The rounded proportions, curves,"
16246,PART I.,and reality of a statue appeal to me as no painting ever did.
16247,PART I.,
16248,PART I.,"Nevertheless, I made no greater progress in molding than in sketching."
16249,PART I.,I made my hands very sticky; I used up several pounds of clay; then I
16250,PART I.,relinquished my hopes of becoming a sculptor. I found it more to my
16251,PART I.,"taste to follow Mr. Hart around the rooms, to chatter with the workmen,"
16252,PART I.,to ask innumerable questions about the “Invention.”
16253,PART I.,
16254,PART I.,It has been suggested that it was to this Invention of Mr. Hart’s that
16255,PART I.,Mrs. Browning referred when she wrote of--
16256,PART I.,
16257,PART I.,"“Just a shadow on a wall,”"
16258,PART I.,
16259,PART I.,from which could be taken--
16260,PART I.,
16261,PART I.,"“The measure of a man,"
16262,PART I.,"Which is the measure of an angel, saith"
16263,PART I.,The apostle.”
16264,PART I.,
16265,PART I.,"Mr. Hart wore the apron and the cap that sculptors affect, as a"
16266,PART I.,"protection from the fine, white dust that the marble sheds; generally,"
16267,PART I.,"too, an ancient dressing-gown. Costumes in Bohemia, the native land of"
16268,PART I.,"artists, are apt to be unconventional."
16269,PART I.,
16270,PART I.,It was a most wondrous thing to me to watch the brown clay take shapes
16271,PART I.,and beauty under the sculptor’s touch. I can still see him fashioning
16272,PART I.,a wreath of grape-leaves around a Bacchante’s head; the leaves would
16273,PART I.,"grow beneath his hand, in all the details of tendrils, stems, veinings."
16274,PART I.,"It seemed to me he must be so happy, to live in this world of his"
16275,PART I.,"own creating. I hope that he was happy, the kindly man; he had the"
16276,PART I.,"patience and the enthusiasm of the genuine artist,--a patience that had"
16277,PART I.,enabled him to surmount serious obstacles before he reached his present
16278,PART I.,"position. Like Powers and Rheinhart, he began life as a stone-cutter."
16279,PART I.,I wonder what dreams of beauty those three men saw imprisoned in the
16280,PART I.,"unhewn stone, to which they longed to give shape, before Fate smiled on"
16281,PART I.,"them, and put them in the way of doing the best that in them lay!"
16282,PART I.,
16283,PART I.,[Illustration: AN ITALIAN GARDEN.]
16284,PART I.,
16285,PART I.,In spite of the fact that neither Painting nor Sculpture proved
16286,PART I.,"propitious, a great reverence and love of Art was born in me at this"
16287,PART I.,"time. Possibly a love and reverence all the more intense, because Art"
16288,PART I.,"became to me, individually, an unattainable thing. I remember passing"
16289,PART I.,"many hours, at this period, in what would certainly have been durance"
16290,PART I.,"vile, had I not been fired with a lofty ambition. Mr. Edwin White was"
16291,PART I.,sketching in a picture which called for two figures--an old man and
16292,PART I.,"a child. The old man was easily obtained, a beautiful professional"
16293,PART I.,model of advanced years; but the child was not so readily found. I was
16294,PART I.,filled with secret joy when it was suggested to me that I should be
16295,PART I.,the required model. I was enchanted when the permission was given me
16296,PART I.,to perform this important service. This was before the time of the
16297,PART I.,long illness to which I referred in the beginning of this paper. The
16298,PART I.,spending every morning for a week or so in Mr. White’s studio implied
16299,PART I.,the being excused from French verbs and Italian translations. What
16300,PART I.,"a happy life, I thought, to be a model! I envied the beautiful old"
16301,PART I.,patriarch with whom I was associated in this picture. Kneeling beside
16302,PART I.,"him, as I was instructed to do, I thought what bliss it would be to be"
16303,PART I.,"associated with him always, and to go about with him from studio to"
16304,PART I.,"studio, posing for pictures."
16305,PART I.,
16306,PART I.,There must be an inspiration for artists in the very air of Florence.
16307,PART I.,"The beautiful city is filled with memorials of the past, painted"
16308,PART I.,and carved by the masters passed away. I suppose that artists are
16309,PART I.,constantly aroused to the wish to do great things by the sight of what
16310,PART I.,"these others have accomplished. Then, too, the history of the past,"
16311,PART I.,"the religion of the past, are such realities in Florence. The artist"
16312,PART I.,"feels called upon to interpret them, not as dead fancies, but as facts."
16313,PART I.,"The mythology of the Greeks and Romans meets one at every turn. I, for"
16314,PART I.,"one, was as intimately acquainted with the family history of Venus, of"
16315,PART I.,"Ceres, of Pallas, of Persephone, as with that of Queen Elizabeth, of"
16316,PART I.,"Catherine de’ Medici, of Henrietta Maria. Nay, I was more intimate with"
16317,PART I.,the delightful elder set.
16318,PART I.,
16319,PART I.,"The heathen gods reigned sylvanly in the Boboli Gardens, and it was"
16320,PART I.,there that I formed a most intimate personal acquaintance with them.
16321,PART I.,"The Boboli Gardens are the gardens of the Pitti Palace, an immense,"
16322,PART I.,"unlovely pile, the memorial of the ambition of the Marquis Pitti, who"
16323,PART I.,reared it. He had vowed that he would build a palace large enough to
16324,PART I.,"hold in its court-yard the palace of his hated rival, the Marquis"
16325,PART I.,Strozzi. He was as good as his word; but in carrying out his designs he
16326,PART I.,"ruined his fortune. The vast palace, when completed, passed out of his"
16327,PART I.,"hands into those of the Medici, then the Dukes of Florence. Afterwards,"
16328,PART I.,it became the residence of the foreign rulers of Florence. When I
16329,PART I.,"remember the city, Austrian soldiers guarded the great gateway of the"
16330,PART I.,"Pitti, and marched up and down the court-yards; and the showy white"
16331,PART I.,uniforms of Austrian officers were conspicuous in the antechambers and
16332,PART I.,guard-rooms.
16333,PART I.,
16334,PART I.,"But behind the great palace, the fair Boboli Gardens spread away. There"
16335,PART I.,"was a statue of Ceres crowning a terrace, up to which climbed other"
16336,PART I.,"terraces--an amphitheatre of terraces, in truth, from a fish-pond in"
16337,PART I.,the centre--which commanded the city through which the Arno flowed.
16338,PART I.,Many a sunny day have we children--my sisters and I--sat at the base
16339,PART I.,"of this statue and gossiped about Ceres,--beautiful Mother Nature, and"
16340,PART I.,"her daughter, who was stolen from her by the Dark King. Further down,"
16341,PART I.,"on a lower slope, was a statue of Pallas, with her calm, resolute"
16342,PART I.,"face, her helmet, her spear, her owl. I remember that Millie, and Eva,"
16343,PART I.,"and I, were especially fond of this Pallas. I used to wonder why it"
16344,PART I.,was that men should ever have been votaries of Venus rather than of
16345,PART I.,"her. I have ceased to wonder at this, since then; but in those days I"
16346,PART I.,"especially criticised a statue of Venus, after the well-known Venus of"
16347,PART I.,"Canova, which impressed me as insipid. This statue stood hard by the"
16348,PART I.,"severe majesty of Pallas, white against a background of oleanders and"
16349,PART I.,laurestines.
16350,PART I.,
16351,PART I.,"Then there was a second fish-pond, in the center of which was an"
16352,PART I.,"orange-island, about which tritons and mermen and mermaids were"
16353,PART I.,"disposed. I can see their good-humored, gay--nay, some of them"
16354,PART I.,"were even _leering_--faces still. Soulless creatures these, we"
16355,PART I.,"were well aware, and so were sorry for them. The immortal gods, of"
16356,PART I.,"course, we credited with souls; but these--with the wood-nymphs, and"
16357,PART I.,"bacchantes, and satyrs, that we were apt to come upon all through the"
16358,PART I.,"garden,--these we classed as only on a level a trifle higher than that"
16359,PART I.,"of the trees, and brooks, into which some of them had been transformed"
16360,PART I.,in the course of the vicissitudes of their careers.
16361,PART I.,
16362,PART I.,Perhaps it is because the spirit of the old religion so took possession
16363,PART I.,"of me in that Italian garden, that to this day the woods, and the"
16364,PART I.,"dells, and the rocks, seem to me to be the embodied forms of living"
16365,PART I.,creatures. A Daphne waves her arms from the laurel tree; a Clytie
16366,PART I.,"forever turns to her sun-lover, in the sunflower."

16378,PART II.,
16379,PART II.,
16380,PART II.,The two public picture galleries of Florence--the Pitti and the
16381,PART II.,Uffizi--are on either side of the Arno. They are connected by a
16382,PART II.,"covered way, which runs along over the roofs of houses, and crosses"
16383,PART II.,"the jewelers’ bridge, so called because upon it are built the shops of"
16384,PART II.,"all the jewelers in town,--or so it would seem at first sight. At all"
16385,PART II.,"events, here are nothing but jewelers’ shops; small shops, such as I"
16386,PART II.,imagine the shops of the middle ages to have been. But in the narrow
16387,PART II.,"windows, and in the unostentatious show-cases, are displayed most"
16388,PART II.,"exquisite workmanship in Florentine mosaic, in turquoise, in malakite,"
16389,PART II.,exquisite as to the quality of the mosaic and the character of the
16390,PART II.,"designs in which the earrings, brooches, bracelets, were made up. As a"
16391,PART II.,"rule, however, the gold-work was inferior, and the settings were very"
16392,PART II.,"apt to come apart, and the pins to break and bend, after a very short"
16393,PART II.,wear.
16394,PART II.,
16395,PART II.,"Sauntering across this bridge, one passes, on his way to the Uffizi,"
16396,PART II.,"various shops in narrow streets, where the silks of Florentine"
16397,PART II.,"manufacture are displayed. Such pretty silks, dear girls, and so cheap!"
16398,PART II.,"For a mere song you may go dressed like the butterflies, in Florence,"
16399,PART II.,"clad in bright, sheeny raiment, spun by native worms out of native"
16400,PART II.,"mulberry leaves. Equally cheap are the cameos, and the coral, that are"
16401,PART II.,"brought here from neighboring Naples, and the turquoises, imported"
16402,PART II.,"directly from the Eastern market, and the mosaics, inlaid of precious"
16403,PART II.,stones in Florence herself.
16404,PART II.,
16405,PART II.,"So we come out upon the Piazza, or Square, of the Uffizi. The Uffizi"
16406,PART II.,"Palace itself is of irregular form, and inclosed by _loggiae_, or"
16407,PART II.,covered colonnades. In front of the palace stands the David of Michael
16408,PART II.,"Angelo, in its strong beauty. Michael Angelo said of this that “the"
16409,PART II.,only test for a statue is the light of a public square.” To this test
16410,PART II.,"the David has been subjected for over three hundred years, and still,"
16411,PART II.,"in the searching light of day, stand revealed the courage and the"
16412,PART II.,faith and the strength of the young man who went forth to do battle
16413,PART II.,"with the giant, “In the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the"
16414,PART II.,armies of Israel.” And who shall say to how many of us Michael Angelo
16415,PART II.,"does not preach, across the centuries, a sermon in stone, as we stand"
16416,PART II.,"before his David?--as we recall what Giants of Doubt, of Passion, of"
16417,PART II.,"Pride, we, too, are called upon to battle with in our day?"
16418,PART II.,
16419,PART II.,"In a square portico, or _loggia_, giving upon the Piazza, is a statue"
16420,PART II.,"of Perseus, another slayer of monsters, or, rather, a slayer of"
16421,PART II.,monsters in another realm. It was this Perseus to whom Pallas gave a
16422,PART II.,"mirror-shield of burnished brass, whom Mercury armed with an adamantine"
16423,PART II.,"scythe, giving him also wings on his feet. It was this Perseus who slew"
16424,PART II.,"the Gorgon Princess Medusa. In the statue, the fatal head of Medusa,"
16425,PART II.,"with its stony stare, is held aloft by the warrior, who is trampling"
16426,PART II.,"upon the headless trunk. This head had, in death as in life, the power"
16427,PART II.,"of turning many men to stone, and was thus made use of by Perseus"
16428,PART II.,against other enemies of his. The subject of the stony-eyed Gorgon
16429,PART II.,"possessed, apparently, a curious fascination for artists. There is a"
16430,PART II.,"famous head painted on wood by Leonardo da Vinci, besides this statue"
16431,PART II.,"by Benvenuto Cellini, in the Uffizi."
16432,PART II.,
16433,PART II.,"How, as a child, I used to puzzle over the strange fable in both statue"
16434,PART II.,"and picture! But, since then, I have had experience of Gorgon natures"
16435,PART II.,"in real life; natures that chilled and repressed, stupefied all with"
16436,PART II.,"whom they came in contact; and I wonder less at the fable, and I pass"
16437,PART II.,"the word on to you, that you may know, when unsympathetic surroundings"
16438,PART II.,"chill your heart and blunt your feelings, and subdue your better self,"
16439,PART II.,"that you are being haunted by Da Vinci’s very Medusa, by Gellini’s very"
16440,PART II.,"Medusa, snaky locks, fixed eyes, impassive deadness."
16441,PART II.,
16442,PART II.,[Illustration: MICHAEL ANGELO IN HIS STUDIO.]
16443,PART II.,
16444,PART II.,"Into the great Uffizi Palace: up the wide marble stairway, into the"
16445,PART II.,long gallery that opens into the immense suite of rooms hung with
16446,PART II.,"pictures; the gallery hung with pictures, too, and set with statues."
16447,PART II.,
16448,PART II.,How I wish I could make you see with my eyes! How I wish I could be
16449,PART II.,"to you something more than a mere traveler, telling what _I_ have"
16450,PART II.,"seen! That long corridor, windows on one side, statues and pictures"
16451,PART II.,"on the other, always seems to me like a nursery for love of art. At"
16452,PART II.,the far end are the quaint pictures of Giotto and Cimabue. Then the
16453,PART II.,"reverent, religious paintings of Fra Angelico. Oh, those sweet-faced,"
16454,PART II.,"golden-haired angels! Oh, the glimpse into the land seen by faith,"
16455,PART II.,"inhabited by shining ones! Oh, the radiance of those pictures! The gold"
16456,PART II.,"back-grounds, the bright faces, the happy effect of them! The artists"
16457,PART II.,"_believed_ them with all their souls, as Ruskin has said; so they"
16458,PART II.,painted pictures which recall the refrain of Bernard de Cluny’s Rhyme
16459,PART II.,"of the Celestial Country. Presently pictures by Perugino, Raphael’s"
16460,PART II.,"master, and--quite at the other end of the gallery--the portrait of"
16461,PART II.,"Raphael, painted by himself. This picture is on an easel, and stands"
16462,PART II.,"apart. Are you familiar with Raphael’s beautiful, calm, _young_ face?"
16463,PART II.,It is a face which has passed into a proverb for beauty and serenity.
16464,PART II.,A velvet cap is pushed off the pure brow; the hair is long and waving;
16465,PART II.,the eyes are large and dark and abstracted. I always stood before this
16466,PART II.,picture as before a shrine.
16467,PART II.,
16468,PART II.,All the way down the gallery are statues and busts. There are the
16469,PART II.,"Roman emperors, far more familiar to me through their counterfeit"
16470,PART II.,"presentments than through the pages of history. Augustus, Diocletian,"
16471,PART II.,"Trajan: to us girls they were studies in hair-dressing, if in nothing"
16472,PART II.,"else. Some of them with flowing locks, some with close, short curls,"
16473,PART II.,"some with hair parted in the middle and laid in long, smooth curls,"
16474,PART II.,"like a woman. Of such was Heliogabulus, and of such was Vitellius."
16475,PART II.,
16476,PART II.,One morning--soon after we came to Florence--we started off up on a
16477,PART II.,"quest--through the Uffizi--Millie, Eva and I, and our elders. The"
16478,PART II.,object of our quest was no less a goddess than she called of the Medici.
16479,PART II.,
16480,PART II.,"I remember that we wandered down the long gallery I have described, and"
16481,PART II.,"through room after room. It was the fancy of our mamma, and the uncle"
16482,PART II.,"who was taking care of us all, to find their way about for themselves."
16483,PART II.,"For instance: if we had been told that a certain picture, by a certain"
16484,PART II.,"master, was to be found in a certain palace, we roamed in and out"
16485,PART II.,around the other pictures until _the_ picture _revealed itself_ to
16486,PART II.,us. It was surprising how seldom we were deceived in this method
16487,PART II.,"of ours. We would pass by dozens of pictures by inferior artists,"
16488,PART II.,"completely unmoved; then, suddenly, a thrilling vision of beauty would"
16489,PART II.,"glow upon us, and we would acknowledge ourselves to be in a royal"
16490,PART II.,presence-chamber.
16491,PART II.,
16492,PART II.,[Illustration]
16493,PART II.,
16494,PART II.,Such a presence-chamber is the Tribune in the Uffizi palace. We came
16495,PART II.,"upon many marble Venuses before we arrived in this Tribune, a large,"
16496,PART II.,"octagon room, with a domed ceiling, blue, flecked with gold stars; but"
16497,PART II.,we passed them all by--until finally we entered the reverent stillness
16498,PART II.,which is kept about the Venus of Venuses. We recognized her at once.
16499,PART II.,"There she stood, in that silent room, the light subdued to a judicious"
16500,PART II.,"mellowness--beautiful with the fresh, smiling beauty of perpetual"
16501,PART II.,youth; beautiful with the same beauty that gladdened the heart of the
16502,PART II.,"Greek artist who carved her, hundreds of years ago; so many hundreds of"
16503,PART II.,"years that the marble has, in consequence, the rich cream-color of old"
16504,PART II.,ivory.
16505,PART II.,
16506,PART II.,"In this same Tribune hangs the portrait of a beautiful young woman,"
16507,PART II.,"called the Fornarina. Of her only this is known, that she was the"
16508,PART II.,"beloved of Raphael, and that she was the daughter of a baker in"
16509,PART II.,"Rome. Fornarina means little bakeress, or, perhaps _we_ should say,"
16510,PART II.,baker-girl. But _this_ Fornarina might be a princess. An “ox-eyed Juno”
16511,PART II.,"princess, dark and glowing, with a serene composure about her that one"
16512,PART II.,remembers as her most striking characteristic.
16513,PART II.,
16514,PART II.,Raphael’s lady-love. Millie and I knew more about her than was ever
16515,PART II.,"written in books. Not reliable gossip--gossip of our own invention, but"
16516,PART II.,gossip that delighted our hearts.
16517,PART II.,
16518,PART II.,"Other pictures by Raphael hang here, too. How distinctly I recall them."
16519,PART II.,How vivid are all the works of this great painter! The critics say that
16520,PART II.,"one who excelled in so many things, excelled also in _expression_. Yes."
16521,PART II.,It is this which gives to his pictures the distinctness of photographs
16522,PART II.,from life. They are dramatic. They take you at once into the spirit
16523,PART II.,"of the scene represented. They are full of soul, and herein lies the"
16524,PART II.,"great difference between Raphael’s works and those of other schools,"
16525,PART II.,"the Venetian, for instance. The painters of Venice aimed at effects of"
16526,PART II.,color; Raphael used color only in order to express a loftier thought.
16527,PART II.,
16528,PART II.,"Are you tired of the Uffizi? Come with me, for a few minutes, before we"
16529,PART II.,"go, into the Hall of Niobe. Words fail me to relate with what mingled"
16530,PART II.,"emotions of sympathy, distress and delight we children used to haunt"
16531,PART II.,"this hall, and examine each sculptured form in turn. The story goes"
16532,PART II.,"that Niobe incurred the displeasure of Diana and Apollo, who wreaked"
16533,PART II.,their vengeance upon the mother by killing her fourteen children.
16534,PART II.,"At the head of the hall stands Niobe, convulsed with grief, vainly"
16535,PART II.,"imploring the angry brother and sister to show compassion, and at the"
16536,PART II.,"same time protecting the youngest child, who is clinging to her. But"
16537,PART II.,we feel that both intercession and protection will be in vain. On
16538,PART II.,the other side of the hall are her sons and daughters. Some already
16539,PART II.,"pierced with arrows, stiff in death; some in the attitude of flight,"
16540,PART II.,some staggering to the ground. It is an easy matter for the imagination
16541,PART II.,"to picture the supreme moment when, bereft of all her children, the"
16542,PART II.,"mother’s heart breaks, and she is turned to stone. The legend relates"
16543,PART II.,that that stone wept tears. Nor was it a difficult matter for me to
16544,PART II.,"take this on faith. What is more, many is the time I have planted"
16545,PART II.,"myself before the very marble Niobe in the Uffizi, firmly expecting to"
16546,PART II.,see the tears flow down her cheeks.
16547,PART II.,
16548,PART II.,"So we come out upon the streets of Florence again. Fair Florence, the"
16549,PART II.,"narrow Arno dividing her, the purple Appennines shutting her in the"
16550,PART II.,"Arno’s fertile valley. Flower-women stop us on the streets, and offer"
16551,PART II.,us flowers. Flower-women who are not as pretty as they are wont to be
16552,PART II.,"at fancy-dress parties; they are apt to be heavy and middle-aged, in"
16553,PART II.,"fact, one of them, the handsomest of the band, has a scar on her face,"
16554,PART II.,and a tinge of romance attached to her name. It is whispered about
16555,PART II.,"that her lover’s dagger inflicted the scar, in a fit of jealousy. Once"
16556,PART II.,"I myself saw a look flash into her eyes, when something was said to"
16557,PART II.,"offend her by a passer-by on the street, which suggested the idea that"
16558,PART II.,she might have used her dagger in return. It was the look of a tiger
16559,PART II.,aroused. And after that I never quite lost sight of the smothered fire
16560,PART II.,in those black eyes of hers.
16561,PART II.,

16563,PART II.,
16564,PART II.,"I used to wonder why I saw so few pretty faces in Florence. Moreover,"
16565,PART II.,how lovely the American ladies always looked in contrast with the
16566,PART II.,"swarthy, heavy Tuscan women. As a rule, that is. Of course, there were"
16567,PART II.,plain Americans and handsome Tuscans; but our countrywomen certainly
16568,PART II.,"bear off the palm for delicacy of feature and coloring. Still, the"
16569,PART II.,"Tuscan peasant-girls make a fine show, with their broad flats of"
16570,PART II.,Leghorn straw; and when they are married they are invariably adorned
16571,PART II.,with strings of Roman pearls about their necks. So many rows of pearls
16572,PART II.,counts for so much worldly wealth.
16573,PART II.,
16574,PART II.,"I stroll on, stopping to look in at the picture stores, or coming to an"
16575,PART II.,enraptured pause before a cellar-way piled up with rare and fragrant
16576,PART II.,"flowers, such as one sees seldom out of Florence--the City of Flowers."

16586,PART III.,
16587,PART III.,
16588,PART III.,One summer we lived in a villa a short distance outside the gates
16589,PART III.,"of Florence. For Florence had gates in those days, and was a walled"
16590,PART III.,"city, kept by Austrian sentinels. That was the time of the Austrian"
16591,PART III.,"occupation. Since then, Solferino and Magenta have been fought, and"
16592,PART III.,"the treaty of Villafranca has been signed, and now, “Italy’s one, from"
16593,PART III.,mountain to sea!”--
16594,PART III.,
16595,PART III.,"“King Victor has Italy’s crown on his head,"
16596,PART III.,"And his flag takes all heaven with its white, green and red.”"
16597,PART III.,
16598,PART III.,"But then the Florentines bowed their necks under a hated foreign yoke,"
16599,PART III.,scowling when they dared at a retreating “maledetto Tedesco” (cursed
16600,PART III.,German).
16601,PART III.,
16602,PART III.,"The phrase “white, green and red” recalls to me the fire-balloons we"
16603,PART III.,"used to send up from our villa garden, on the summer nights of long"
16604,PART III.,"ago. We had, for our Italian tutor, an enthusiastic patriot, who had"
16605,PART III.,"fought in the Italian ranks in ’48, and who was looking forward to"
16606,PART III.,shouldering a musket soon again. It afforded him intense gratification
16607,PART III.,to send the national colors floating out over Florence. Our villa was
16608,PART III.,"built on a hill-side, commanding a fine view of the Val d’Arno, and"
16609,PART III.,"of the City of Flowers herself, domed, campaniled, spired. The longer"
16610,PART III.,"the voyages made by our balloons, the higher rose the spirits of our"
16611,PART III.,"Signor Vicenzo. He regarded these airy nothings, made by his own hands,"
16612,PART III.,"of tissue paper and alcohol, as omens of good or ill to his beloved"
16613,PART III.,country.
16614,PART III.,
16615,PART III.,"I suppose he was a fair type of his countrymen intensely dramatic,"
16616,PART III.,with a native facility of expression. One notices this facility
16617,PART III.,of expression among all classes. The Italians have an eloquent
16618,PART III.,"sign-language of their own, in which they are as proficient as in"
16619,PART III.,the language of spoken words. It is charming to see two neighbors
16620,PART III.,"communicating with each other across the street, without uttering"
16621,PART III.,"a syllable, by the means of animated gestures. It seems a natural"
16622,PART III.,sequence that they should be a people of artists.
16623,PART III.,
16624,PART III.,"Such long rambles as my sisters and I and our maid Assunta took,"
16625,PART III.,starting from the villa! Assunta was the daughter of a neighboring
16626,PART III.,"countryman of the better sort, who cultivated a grape vineyard and an"
16627,PART III.,"olive field, besides keeping a dairy. We had a way of happening by in"
16628,PART III.,the evening in time for a glass of warm milk. Assunta’s mother supplied
16629,PART III.,"our table with milk and butter daily, moreover; butter made into tiny"
16630,PART III.,"pats and done up daintily in grape leaves, never salted, by the way;"
16631,PART III.,"milk put up in flasks cased in straw, such as are also used for the"
16632,PART III.,"native wine. Was it the unfailing appetite of childhood, or was that"
16633,PART III.,milk and butter really superior to any I have ever tasted since? What
16634,PART III.,"charming breakfasts recur to me! _Semele_, as we called our baker’s"
16635,PART III.,rolls; a golden circle of butter on its own leaf; great figs bursting
16636,PART III.,with juicy sweetness; milk.
16637,PART III.,
16638,PART III.,"How good those figs used to taste for lunch, too, when we would pay a"
16639,PART III.,few _crazis_ for the privilege of helping ourselves to them off the
16640,PART III.,"fig-trees in some _podere_ (orchard, vineyard), inclosed in its own"
16641,PART III.,"stone wall, on which scarlet poppies waved in the golden sunlight,"
16642,PART III.,"beneath the blue, blue skies. Am I waxing descriptive and dull?"
16643,PART III.,"Well, dear girls, I wish you could have shared those days with me."
16644,PART III.,"Roaming about those hill-sides, my sisters and I peopled them with the"
16645,PART III.,"creatures of our own imaginations, as well as those of other people’s"
16646,PART III.,"imaginations, to say nothing of veritable historical characters. We"
16647,PART III.,read and re-read Roger’s _Italy_. Do you know that enchanting book? Can
16648,PART III.,"you say by heart, as Millie, Eva and I could, “Ginevra,” and “Luigi,”"
16649,PART III.,and “The Brides of Venice”? I wonder if I should like that poetry now?
16650,PART III.,"I _loved_ it then. Also, I date my knowledge of Byron to that same"
16651,PART III.,"epoch. We children devoured the descriptions in “Childe Harold,” and"
16652,PART III.,"absorbed “The Two Foscari,” which otherwise we would perhaps have never"
16653,PART III.,read. Byron was the poet of our fathers and mothers; but in these early
16654,PART III.,days dramatic and narrative poetry was more intelligible than the
16655,PART III.,"mysticism of Tennyson and the Brownings, so enchanting to me now."
16656,PART III.,
16657,PART III.,[Illustration: A CHRISTMAS TREE FESTIVAL.--]
16658,PART III.,
16659,PART III.,"One evening, some friends who occupied a neighboring villa invited"
16660,PART III.,mamma to be present at the reading of a manuscript poem by an American
16661,PART III.,"poet, Buchanan Read. I was permitted to go, too, and was fully alive to"
16662,PART III.,the dignity of the occasion. Mr. Read was making a reputation rapidly;
16663,PART III.,there was no telling what might be in store for him. The generous
16664,PART III.,"hand of brother artists in Florence all cheered him on his way, and"
16665,PART III.,accorded to him precisely that kind of sympathetic encouragement which
16666,PART III.,"his peculiar nature required. The group of interested, friendly faces"
16667,PART III.,"in the _salon_ at Villa Allori rises up before me as I write, on the"
16668,PART III.,"evening when Mr. Read, occupying a central position, read aloud, in his"
16669,PART III.,"charming, trained voice."
16670,PART III.,
16671,PART III.,"I remember that, in the pauses of the reading, Mr. Powers, who was"
16672,PART III.,"present, amused one or two children about him by drawing odd little"
16673,PART III.,"caricatures on a stray bit of note paper, which is, by the way, still"
16674,PART III.,in my possession. Doubtless Mr. Powers’ reputation rests upon his
16675,PART III.,"statues, not his caricatures; yet these particular ones have an immense"
16676,PART III.,"value for me, dashed off with a twinkle in the artist’s beautiful dark"
16677,PART III.,eyes.
16678,PART III.,
16679,PART III.,"There was also present on this occasion a beautiful young lady, for"
16680,PART III.,"whom Mr. Read had just written some birthday verses, which he read to"
16681,PART III.,"us, after having completed the reading of the larger manuscript. Those"
16682,PART III.,"birthday verses have haunted me ever since, and this, although I cannot"
16683,PART III.,recall a word of the more ambitious poem.
16684,PART III.,
16685,PART III.,Mr. Powers had lived for so many years in Florence that he was by
16686,PART III.,"right of that, if by no other right, the patriarch of the American"
16687,PART III.,"colony there. He and his large family were most intensely American,"
16688,PART III.,in spite of their long expatriation. His was emphatically an American
16689,PART III.,"_home_, as completely so as though the Arno and the Appenines had been,"
16690,PART III.,"instead, the Mississippi and the Alleghanies. This was no doubt due"
16691,PART III.,to the fact that Mrs. Powers was preëminently an American wife and
16692,PART III.,"mother, large-hearted and warm-hearted. She never forgot the household"
16693,PART III.,traditions of her youth. She baked mince-pies and pumpkin-pies at
16694,PART III.,"Christmas and Thanksgiving, and dispensed these bounties to her"
16695,PART III.,"countrymen with a lavish hand. Then, too, the Powers lived in a"
16696,PART III.,"_house_, and not in an _apartment_, or, as we say, on a flat. The"
16697,PART III.,"children ran up and down-stairs, and in and out their own yard, which"
16698,PART III.,"lay between the dwelling-house and the studio, just as American"
16699,PART III.,"children do. And in this genial, wholesome home an artist grew up in"
16700,PART III.,the second generation. A son of Mr. Powers is now making name and fame
16701,PART III.,for himself in his father’s profession.
16702,PART III.,
16703,PART III.,It has been said that the beautiful face of the eldest daughter of this
16704,PART III.,family is suggested in her father’s “Greek Slave.” I looked up to her
16705,PART III.,"then with the respect which a child feels for an elder girl, “a young"
16706,PART III.,"lady in society.” I can appreciate now and admire, even more than I did"
16707,PART III.,"then, the extreme simplicity and unconsciousness which so well accorded"
16708,PART III.,"with her grand, classic beauty. She was the good fairy at a Christmas"
16709,PART III.,"Tree Festival, to which all the American girls and boys in Florence"
16710,PART III.,"were bidden, on the twenty-fifth of December. We were all presented"
16711,PART III.,"with most exquisitely made _bonbonnieres_, chiefly of home manufacture."
16712,PART III.,We were feasted on doughnuts which brought tears to some of our eyes;
16713,PART III.,"dear American doughnuts, that _might_ have been fried in the land"
16714,PART III.,of the free. We had French candy _ad libitum_; but there was also on
16715,PART III.,"exhibition a pound or so of genuine American stick candy, such as we"
16716,PART III.,"see by the bushel in this country, and which had been brought over from"
16717,PART III.,"the United States by a friend recently arrived, at Mrs. Powers’ special"
16718,PART III.,request We examined this stick candy with patriotic enthusiasm. We ate
16719,PART III.,"little bits of it, and thought it infinitely better than our candied"
16720,PART III.,fruits and chocolate creams. Doubtless this little incident here
16721,PART III.,recalled will account for the fact that I always associate peppermint
16722,PART III.,stick candy with the flag of the Union. It is an unfortunate caprice
16723,PART III.,"of mind; but, nevertheless, the national stripes always rise before me"
16724,PART III.,when I see these red and white sticks.
16725,PART III.,
16726,PART III.,I am inclined to the belief that exiles make the best patriots. We
16727,PART III.,"American children stood up fiercely for our own native land, whenever"
16728,PART III.,the question as to national superiority arose between ourselves and
16729,PART III.,"English, French, or Italian children,--especially the English. With"
16730,PART III.,"these we fought the Revolutionary war all over again, hotly, if"
16731,PART III.,injudiciously. And I am confident that we had a personal and individual
16732,PART III.,"sense of superiority over them. No doubt we were endowed, even at that"
16733,PART III.,"early age, with the proverbial national conceit. Some one had told me"
16734,PART III.,"that every American was a sovereign, and that I was consequently a"
16735,PART III.,"princess in my own right. This became a conviction with me, and greatly"
16736,PART III.,increased my self-importance. How glorious to be the citizen of a
16737,PART III.,country of such magnificent gifts of citizenship!
16738,PART III.,
16739,PART III.,But to return to Mr. Powers. His statue of California was on exhibition
16740,PART III.,"at this time. This is, to my mind, the most noble and impressive of"
16741,PART III.,"his works. The strong, resolute face, of classic outlines, and of the"
16742,PART III.,"sterner type of beauty, bears a distinct resemblance to the sculptor’s"
16743,PART III.,"second daughter, although by no means a portrait. It has been told me"
16744,PART III.,"that one of the fathers of our American church, traveling in Italy,"
16745,PART III.,suggested an important alteration in this statue. California originally
16746,PART III.,"carried in her hand a bar, supposed to represent a bar of solid gold."
16747,PART III.,The idea occurred to the bishop that were this smooth bar--which might
16748,PART III.,"mean anything--made to represent a nugget of gold in the rough, the"
16749,PART III.,point of the story would be far more effectively told; and on this idea
16750,PART III.,"the bishop spoke. The sculptor was impressed directly, and with all the"
16751,PART III.,unaffected simplicity of real genius he thanked his critic for the
16752,PART III.,"hint. California now displays her symbolic nugget; and, moreover, about"
16753,PART III.,her head is designed a fillet of bits of ore in the rough.
16754,PART III.,
16755,PART III.,The America of Powers is another impressive and beautiful female form.
16756,PART III.,"A vision of the sculptor comes before my eyes, standing in front of"
16757,PART III.,"this statue, and talking it over with a party of visitors. Such a"
16758,PART III.,"beautiful, simple-mannered man--with his mild dark eyes and serene"
16759,PART III.,"face! He wore the usual blouse and linen apron, and the cap of the"
16760,PART III.,sculptor. He held his chisel in his hand as he conversed. Some of
16761,PART III.,his audience did not agree with him in the peculiar political views
16762,PART III.,"he held. But Mr. Powers would not argue, and what need? Had he not"
16763,PART III.,preached his sermon in stone and eloquently!

16801,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"horsewoman, she often joined her father in rural pastimes, shooting,"
16802,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"hunting etc. Being perfectly well, and of great mind, she acquired, as"
16803,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"do all the noble women of Europe, a thorough knowledge of the ancient"
16804,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,classics in their originals; also a familiarity with nearly every

16808,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"in English, is quite at home on German philosophy, notwithstanding her"
16809,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,devotion to the Catholic Church. A singularly attractive old lady is

16812,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,We have seen the likeness. It is pronounced perfect. She is very
16813,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"anxious for us to see his Holiness, and we certainly shall not leave"
16814,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Rome without so doing. The Baroness has an autograph note from Pio
16815,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Nono, which is a rare possession. This she displayed with far more"
16816,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,pride than was apparent upon showing her own handiwork. When the Holy

16855,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,the Monday Reception at the Vatican. On my way (and those who know
16856,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Rome as well as we do will know how much on the way) I took, as I do"
16857,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"upon all occasions, the Roman and Trajan forums, always walking when"
16858,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"practicable; by the above means, I am likely to become very familiar"

16863,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"see, one of those picturesque groups of Contadini and Contadine who"
16864,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"frequent the towns of Italy. There were, first the parents, dressed in"

16866,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"the long double pads, one scarlet and one white, hanging over her head"

16869,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"conceivable color simple and combined, yellow handkerchief thrown over"

16875,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Two boys in equally remarkable attire, and a baby that looked like a"
16876,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"butterfly, completed the domestic circle. They did not seem to mind my"
16877,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"gaze. The father continued his smoking, the mother her knitting, the"
16878,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"girls their hooking, the boys their listless lounging, and the baby its"
16879,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,play in the dust. There was a charm in the scene. One sight however
16880,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,(to be sure mine was an extended opportunity) is sufficient. A few
16881,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"steps beyond this gathering, I found photographs colored to represent"
16882,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"these vagrants, and at one store pictures of the very individuals--I"
16883,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"purchased specimens to take to America, a novelty the other side of the"
16884,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Atlantic.
16885,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16886,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"After an hour or two, I reached the American College, was met by the"
16887,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"students who very politely directed me to the Concièrge, and my name"
16888,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"was taken to the learned Father. The students all wore the long robe,"
16889,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,though speaking English.
16890,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16891,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Being a Quaker by birth, therefore educated to respect every man’s"
16892,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"religion, and to believe that every man respects mine, nevertheless I"
16893,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,felt misgivings incumbent upon the meeting of extremes. I was ushered
16894,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"into a large drawing-room and was examining the pictures, which"
16895,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"generally tell the character of the owner, when Mr. Chatard entered."
16896,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"As he asked me to be seated, I thought, as some one has expressed"
16897,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"it before me, “the whole world over, there are but two kinds of"
16898,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"people,--‘man and woman.’”"
16899,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16900,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,The youth of this college may thank their stars that America has given
16901,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"them one of her most learned and worthy sons, though the sect to which"
16902,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,his mother once belonged must deplore his loss.
16903,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16904,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"In conversation with this Reverend gentleman, I obtained the"
16905,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"requirements necessary to an introduction to the Pope, and was a"
16906,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,little surprised that he should question my willingness to conform to
16907,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"the same. It was however, explained. He had been much embarrassed by"
16908,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,the demeanor of some of the American women. Seeking the privilege of
16909,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"meeting the Pope in his own palace, where common courtesy and etiquette"
16910,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"naturally demand a deference to the Lord of the Manor, yet these"
16911,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"ladies, having previously guaranteed a compliance with the laws of"
16912,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"ceremony, after gaining admission refused to obey them."
16913,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16914,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Seeing the Pope was not, to me, a religious service and is not"
16915,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,generally so considered.
16916,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16917,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"My only fear was that my plain manners in their brusqueness, would have"
16918,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,the appearance of “omission.”
16919,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16920,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"But the requirements are simple. Bending the knee, as a physical"
16921,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"performance, was a source of anxiety. I at once called to mind the"
16922,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"great difficulty which, as a young girl, I had in the play:"
16923,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16924,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,“If I _had_ as many wives
16925,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"As the stars in the skies,” etc."
16926,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16927,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,Notwithstanding the person who had to kneel in the game had a large
16928,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"cushion to throw before her to receive the fall, I always shook the"
16929,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,house from the foundations when I went down. I can hear the pendants
16930,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"now, of a chandelier in a certain frame house in my native town ring"
16931,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"out my weight, as I flung the cushion in front of a boy that knew"
16932,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"“he was not the one,” and took to my knees. True, the Vatican is not"
16933,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"shaky in its underpinnnings, and faithful practice upon the floor of"
16934,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"my apartment in Bocca di Leone, I thought, would be productive of some"
16935,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"good. Quickly running through this train of reflection, and finally"
16936,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,trusting that the gathering would not be disturbed by any marked
16937,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"awkwardness, I returned home to await the tidings."
16938,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16939,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,_Monday Evening._ Have seen Pio Nono--have committed no enormity.
16940,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16941,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"According to directions, in black dress, black veil, _à la_ Spanish"
16942,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"lady, ungloved hands (what an appearance at a Presidential reception!)"
16943,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,we were attired. Took a carriage for the Vatican. Before we left home
16944,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"the padrona viewed us, pronounced us all right, and earnestly sought"
16945,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,the privilege of selecting a coach for us. She had an eye to style. Is
16946,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"it possible that she did not give us credit for the same “strength,”"
16947,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,and we traveling Americans? It is to be confessed that the horses were
16948,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,less like donkeys than otherwise might have been. Trying the knee the
16949,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"last thing before leaving the house, there was certainly reason for"
16950,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"encouragement, though still a lingering humility."
16951,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16952,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Our ride was subdued, but we reached St. Peter’s, passed through the"
16953,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"elegant halls of the Pope’s Palace, surpassed only by those of the"
16954,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Pitti at Florence in their gold and fresco, and were ushered into the"
16955,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,reception room of Pio Nono.
16956,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16957,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"This apartment, long and narrow, seemed more like a corridor than a"
16958,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"hall. Its beauties are described in various guide books, so that “they"
16959,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,who read can see.”
16960,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16961,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,We were the only Protestants. The other ladies were laden with
16962,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"magnificent rosaries, pictures, toys, ribbons, etc., for the Holy"
16963,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"Father’s blessing. Even I purchased one of the first, viz., a rosary,"
16964,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"to undergo the same ceremony, as a gift to a much-loved servant girl at"
16965,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,home.
16966,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16967,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,We sat here many minutes in quiet (inwardly longing to try the fall.)
16968,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,At length the Pope was led in. We forgot our trials. A countenance so
16969,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"benign, beaming with goodness, spread a cheer throughout the assembly."
16970,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"We took the floor naturally and involuntarily. Except in dress, he"
16971,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"might have been any old patriarch. The white robe, long and plain, gave"
16972,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,him rather the appearance of a matriarch.
16973,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16974,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,It chanced that his Holiness passed first up the right side of the
16975,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"hall. We sat _vis à vis_, so that we had the benefit of all that he"
16976,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"said before we came in turn. While addressing the right, who continue"
16977,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"on their knees, the left rise. As he turns to the latter they again"
16978,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"kneel, whereas those opposite change from this posture to the standing."
16979,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16980,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"The Pope talked now in French, now in Italian mostly in the former. As"
16981,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"he approached our party, we were introduced merely as Americans, but"
16982,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,our religion was stamped upon our brows. Turning kindly to my young
16983,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"daughter, who wore, as an ornament, a chain and cross, he said, as"
16984,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"if quite sure of the fact, “_You_ can wear your cross outside, as an"
16985,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"ornament; I am obliged to wear mine inside as a cross;” whereupon, with"
16986,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"a smile, he drew this emblem from his wide ribbon sash, showing her a"
16987,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"most elegant massive cross of gold and diamonds, probably the most"
16988,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"valuable one in the world. As he replaced this mark of devotion, his"
16989,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"countenance expressing a recognition of our Protestantism, perhaps a"
16990,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"pity for our future, placing his hand upon our heads, he passed on. The"
16991,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"blessing of a good old man, whatever his faith, can injure no one, and"
16992,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,"may not be without its efficacy, even though it rest upon a disciple of"
16993,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,George Fox.
16994,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,
16995,BY MRS. ALFRED MACY.,I shall never cease to be glad that I have seen Pio Nono.

17007,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Hello, girls! I say, hello!”"
17008,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17009,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,This polite salutation was addressed to two young girls who were
17010,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,standing at the parsonage gate in the little village of Valery’s
17011,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Corners. The taller of the two colored with vexation, and looked back"
17012,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,to the house as though she hoped no one had seen or heard.
17013,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17014,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The second answered in a clear, rather peculiar voice, “How do you do,"
17015,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Carlos?”
17016,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17017,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I say,” returned Carlos, “I was up to your place, and seen your folks"

17019,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17020,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I hope they were all well,” said the girl who had spoken before, while"

17023,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Well, no, they wasn’t, jest. I thought I’d tell you--”"

17025,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, what is it?” cried Fayette Locey, running out to the wagon, while"
17026,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her companion followed more slowly, looking rather annoyed than anxious."
17027,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17028,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, it ain’t nothing to be scared at, only Mr. Ford and Dick ain’t to"
17029,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"home. They’ve gone over to the cattle sale at Elmira, and young Mis’"
17030,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Ford she’s there alone, with only your aunt, and the hired man, and the"
17031,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,baby.”
17032,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17033,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Is the baby sick?” asked Fayette, troubled."

17036,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17037,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Will you be good enough to tell us at once what _is_ the matter?” said
17038,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen Ford, speaking for the first time with a sort of cold irritation"
17039,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and a certain dignity which Carlos, though it rather awed him, resented"
17040,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,as “stuck up.”
17041,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17042,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Ye see,” said Carlos, letting the reins hang loose over the backs of"
17043,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the two old farm horses, “I was a-going past your house this morning,"
17044,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and I knew you was down here, and I thought your folks might have"
17045,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,something to send.”
17046,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17047,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“You were very kind,” said Fayette; but Helen made no sign."
17048,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17049,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I see young Mis’ Ford, and she said the old lady was kind of ailin’,"
17050,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and the men folks being away, and no one but Hiram, she felt kind of"
17051,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,lonesome.”
17052,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17053,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Did she send you for us?” asked Helen.
17054,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17055,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“No, not jest. She said the old lady might be going to have one of her"
17056,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"bad spells, and as I was coming down to the corners I might tell you,"
17057,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and you could act your judgment, though she didn’t want to disappoint"
17058,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,you of your visit. I could see she was consid’rable anxious.”
17059,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17060,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Are you going back soon?” asked Fayette.
17061,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17062,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“’Bout half an hour or so. Tell ye what. I’ll call when I’ve done my
17063,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"arrands, and then you’ll have your minds made up.”"
17064,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17065,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, thank you, Carlos,” said Fayette, gratefully. “I wish you would.”"
17066,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17067,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen said nothing; but as they walked back to the house, she looked"
17068,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"perplexed and annoyed. “So provoking of Sue,” she broke out at last."
17069,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“If there was anything really the matter, why couldn’t she send a note?"
17070,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,But she is so nervous and fanciful.”
17071,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17072,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Sue’s not very strong, and you know Hiram is no one to depend upon. I"
17073,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,hope Mrs. Allison and Eleanor will be back before we go.”
17074,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17075,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“So you are going?” said Helen, as if the idea vexed her."
17076,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17077,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Why, Helen, I think one of us should go. If aunt had such an attack as"
17078,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"she had in the winter, what could Sue do?”"
17079,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17080,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I dare say it is only her fancy,” said Helen. “But you are as ready to"
17081,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"fancy things as she is, Fayette. If there were any reason for anxiety,”"
17082,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,she continued in the even tones which had contributed to establish
17083,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen Ford’s character as a “superior girl,”--“If there were any reason"
17084,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"for anxiety, don’t you suppose I should be as anxious about my mother"
17085,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"as you can be, who never saw her till you came to live with us three"
17086,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,months ago?”
17087,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17088,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,There was a covert sting in these words which Fayette felt and
17089,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"resented, but she held her tongue."
17090,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17091,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Then I don’t want to miss this lecture,” Helen resumed. “It is the"
17092,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"last of the set, and I feel it my duty to improve every opportunity"
17093,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,that is offered me.”
17094,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17095,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Fayette slightly raised her black eyebrows. She knew her cousin’s way
17096,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,of squaring her duty with her inclination.
17097,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17098,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I presume, too, that the boy has quite exaggerated the case. Persons"
17099,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"of that class always like to make a sensation, and I dare say Sue only"
17100,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,meant that mother had a little cold. She has such a habit of talking to
17101,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,all sorts of people as if they were her equals.”
17102,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17103,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Yes, I think Sue does rather look upon human beings as if they were"
17104,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her fellow-creatures,” said Fayette."
17105,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17106,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I don’t profess to understand sarcasm,” said Helen, setting her rather"
17107,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"thin lips very straight. “Papa and Dick will be at home to-morrow,"
17108,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and one night can make no very great difference to Sue. It would be a
17109,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,serious disadvantage to me to lose this lecture. I have the notes of
17110,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the whole set, and this is the last, and I should never be satisfied to"
17111,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,leave them in that unfinished state.”
17112,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17113,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“And suppose you were not satisfied? What then?” said Fayette.
17114,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17115,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"For a moment Helen had an odd sensation, as though some one had"
17116,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,suddenly lifted a curtain and given her a glimpse of an unsuspected
17117,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"near and unpleasing region; but the feeling passed, and left behind it"
17118,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,a sense of vexation with her cousin.
17119,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17120,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Persons who do not care for intellectual pleasures can never
17121,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"understand what they are to others,” said Helen, with a superior and"
17122,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"pitying smile, which provoked Fayette. “As the professor said last"
17123,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"night, it is the first duty of every one to develop his or her nature"
17124,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to its highest capacities, and to seize every opportunity for mental"
17125,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,enlargement.”
17126,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17127,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Fiddlesticks!” thought the irreverent Fayette; but she did not say it,"
17128,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and that at least was something.
17129,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17130,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Then it would not be polite to the Allisons to go off in this way, and"
17131,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"when company is coming to tea, too. Mr. Allison is gone, and the ladies"
17132,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,won’t be home till nearly tea time. How it would look to go off!”
17133,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17134,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“We could leave a message; and, Helen, if Sue were nervous and"
17135,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"fanciful,--and I don’t think she is,--it would only be one more reason"
17136,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"for not leaving her alone. I shall go,” concluded Fayette, with sudden"
17137,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,decision.
17138,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17139,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“You will do as you please, of course,” said Helen, coldly, but"
17140,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,secretly not ill pleased. “But it will look very strange.”
17141,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17142,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“I can’t help it. You can tell them all how it was;” and Fayette ran up
17143,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,stairs to pack up her things.
17144,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17145,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,She had hardly done so when Carlos came back. “I wish you joy of your
17146,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"companion,” said Helen to her cousin, with something very like a sneer."
17147,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17148,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I might easily have a worse one,” said Fayette, who liked the big,"
17149,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"simple young fellow. “One of us is enough to go, and it may as well be"
17150,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,I as you. I hope you’ll enjoy the evening. Remember me to Miss Fenton
17151,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and the others.”
17152,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17153,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,It was with a little pang that Fayette spoke. She had been quite as
17154,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"much interested in the lectures as her cousin, and she had found"
17155,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"herself very much at home with the Misses Fenton, the granddaughters of"
17156,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Mrs. Lyndon, at the Hickories."
17157,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17158,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Well, of course one is enough, and more than enough,” said Helen; “but"
17159,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"I suppose now you have alarmed yourself so, you will not be satisfied"
17160,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,to stay here. I shall come home with Mr. Allison Sunday. Good-bye.”
17161,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17162,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen went back to the house, and laid out her dress for the evening."

17164,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The party from the Hickories, and the stray professor, who had given"
17165,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"four lectures on geology in Valery’s Corners, were coming to tea at the"
17166,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Parsonage.
17167,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17168,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen had met the professor before, and had been complimented on the"
17169,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"interest she displayed in science, and she felt, as she said, that"
17170,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,she could not be satisfied without putting down the notes of the last
17171,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,lecture.
17172,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17173,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Helen was an intellectual girl--so said her teachers, and so she"
17174,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"believed. She liked to acquire facts, and rules, and classifications,"
17175,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"and dates, and range them all nicely away in her mind, as she put her"
17176,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"cuffs, and collars, and laces, and ribbons in her boxes; as she saved"
17177,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"odds and ends of silk and linen, and put them into labeled bags."
17178,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17179,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"As it pleased her to look over her drawers, and count up her"
17180,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"possessions, so she liked to review her stock of knowledge gained from"
17181,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"text-books, and say, “All this is _mine_.”"
17182,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17183,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,She told Mrs. Allison that her sister-in-law had sent a message by
17184,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Carlos, and that Fayette had gone home."
17185,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17186,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Sue is a little nervous sometimes,” said Helen, in her most superior"
17187,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,manner.
17188,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17189,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Helen’s evening was very successful. She was invited to the Hickories
17190,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"by Mrs. Lyndon. She talked to the professor. She took her notes, but"
17191,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"some way, even when she had neatly copied out the names of all the"
17192,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"saurians, she did not feel as well “satisfied” as she had expected."
17193,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17194,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,It was not till between seven and eight that evening that Carlos set
17195,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Fayette down at her uncle’s gate.
17196,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17197,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The roads were rough, and they had been a long time coming the nine"
17198,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"miles. Carlos lived at Scrub Hollow, a very forlorn hamlet, three miles"
17199,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,further away.
17200,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17201,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"It was a wild March night, with a loud-sounding wind rushing through"
17202,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the upper air. Fayette, as she stood at the gate a moment, and looked"
17203,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"out over the confused mass of rounded, rolling hills that formed the"
17204,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"dim landscape, felt lonely and half frightened."
17205,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17206,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Everything was so dim and gray, and seemed so full of mysterious sound!"
17207,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The low roar of increasing streams, the multiplied whisper and rustle"
17208,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"of the woods, made the world seem something different from the ordinary"
17209,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,daylight earth.
17210,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17211,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"She shook off the fancies that crowded upon her, and walked quickly up"
17212,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to the house, which stood at some distance from the road--a pile of"
17213,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"gray buildings, with sharp, many-angled roofs rising against the sky."
17214,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17215,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,A light shone from the “living-room” window.
17216,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17217,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Fayette opened the door, and was greeted by a cry of joy from young"
17218,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Mrs. Ford.
17219,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17220,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, Fayette! I’m so glad it’s you!” and there was an emphasis as, if"
17221,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,the speaker were rather glad it was not some one else.
17222,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17223,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I thought I’d come,” said Fayette, kissing her. “How’s aunt?”"
17224,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17225,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“I think she is pretty sick,” said Sue, lowering her voice. “She’s gone"
17226,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,to bed.”
17227,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17228,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“Have you sent Hiram for the doctor?”
17229,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17230,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Hiram has gone. I’m all alone. Word came over from Springville, just"
17231,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"after Carlos was here, that his father had broken his leg, and he had"
17232,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to go, of course.”"
17233,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17234,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“But why didn’t you tell him to send Dr. Ward over?”
17235,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17236,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Mother wouldn’t let me. You know how she hates to send for a doctor,"
17237,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and she thought she’d be better.”
17238,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17239,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"A voice from the next room called to know who was there, and Fayette"
17240,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,went in.
17241,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17242,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Mrs. Ford was in bed, her face drawn and pinched. A look of pain"
17243,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,crossed her features as her niece entered. There was disappointment in
17244,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her voice as she said,--"
17245,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17246,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Is that you, Fayette?”"
17247,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17248,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“Yes, aunt. I thought I’d come.”"
17249,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17250,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"There are women who, in Mrs. Ford’s place, would have been angry with"
17251,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the girl for doing what one dearer had left undone; but Mrs. Ford, if"
17252,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"she had such a feeling, was too just to visit it upon Fayette."
17253,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17254,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“You are a good child,” she said, with uncommon softness, but with a"
17255,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,sigh. “Don’t be troubled. I shall get over it by and by.”
17256,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17257,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,But Mrs. Ford did not get over it. The trouble was furious and intense
17258,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,neuralgia; not such as young ladies have when they suffer “awfully” in
17259,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the morning, and go to a party at night, but blinding, burning pain,"
17260,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"reducing the life power every minute, and threatening the heart."
17261,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17262,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Sue and Fayette tried in vain every remedy in their power. Even Mrs.
17263,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Ford’s favorite panacea of seven different herbs, steeped in spirits"
17264,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"with pepper and spice, utterly failed."
17265,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17266,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The patient grew worse and worse, and at midnight it was evident that,"
17267,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"unless help came speedily, her hours were numbered."
17268,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17269,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The farm was not on the high road, and their nearest neighbors were two"
17270,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"old maiden ladies, a mile away, neither of whom could have been of the"
17271,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,least use.
17272,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17273,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Scrub Hollow lay three miles to the south. A nurse might have been
17274,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"found there, but no physician. Springville, where Dr. Ward lived, was a"
17275,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,little further off in the opposite direction.
17276,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17277,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The road to Springville was rough and lonely, and lay over wind-swept"
17278,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"hill and through dark valley, by woods and swamps; for this portion of"
17279,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,the southern frontier is even now but thinly settled.
17280,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17281,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“What shall we do?” said poor Sue, wringing her hands. “What shall we"
17282,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,do?”
17283,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17284,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“There’s only one thing to do,” said Fayette, desperately. “I shall go"
17285,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,for the doctor.”
17286,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17287,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, Fayette! Walk all that way alone!”"
17288,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17289,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,“I shall ride Phœbe. I can saddle her myself. Father taught me how. I
17290,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"must go, Sue. I can’t let aunt lie here and die, and never try to save"
17291,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her. It’s hard to leave you alone, but it won’t take long. Baby hasn’t"
17292,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"waked up once. What a mercy! Don’t say a word, Sue: I must go.”"
17293,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17294,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, Fayette!” cried Sue, helplessly; but she made no further objection,"
17295,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and Mrs. Ford had not heard the hurried consultation.
17296,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17297,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Fayette would give herself no time to think. She was a nervous little
17298,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"thing, and she dreaded the long ride through the windy night more than"
17299,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,she had ever feared anything in her life.
17300,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17301,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"She was not a very daring rider, though at the little frontier post"
17302,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"where she had passed two years with her parents, her father had taught"
17303,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her to manage a horse with reasonable skill, and she had ridden many a"
17304,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,mile with him over the prairie.
17305,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17306,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"“O, if father were here now!” she said, a sob suddenly rising."
17307,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17308,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Then she was doubtful about her own power to manage Phœbe, the great"
17309,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"chestnut mare, the pride of her uncle’s heart, strong, swift, spirited"
17310,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,creature that she was.
17311,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17312,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"For two years Phœbe had borne away the prize at state and county fairs,"
17313,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,and the horse-racing world had tempted her owner in vain. Fayette had
17314,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"mounted her more than once, and ridden around the yard, and up and down"
17315,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the road, but always with some secret fears. She had never dared even"
17316,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to try a canter; and now to mount at “mirk midnight,” and go, as fast"
17317,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"as might be, off into the darkness alone on Phœbe’s back, seemed an"
17318,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,awful thing to poor Fayette.
17319,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17320,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"She knew that the mare was gentle, and she had often petted her, and"
17321,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"fed her, and led her to water. She did not much doubt but that Phœbe"
17322,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"would submit to be saddled and bridled by her hand, but still it was"
17323,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,with many a misgiving that she put on her hat and jacket. She did not
17324,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"take time to find her habit, and, lighting the lantern, went out to the"
17325,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,barn.
17326,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17327,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Phœbe was not lying down. Disturbed, perhaps, by the loud-blowing wind,"
17328,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"she was wide awake; and as Fayette entered with the light, she turned"
17329,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"her head with a low whinny, as though glad to see a friend."
17330,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17331,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,Fayette went into the stall in fear and trembling; but she loosened
17332,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"the halter, and led Phœbe out unresisting."
17333,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17334,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"The mare was so tall, and Fayette was so short, that she was obliged"
17335,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"to stand up on a box to slip on the bridle; to which Phœbe submitted,"
17336,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"turning her soft, intelligent eyes on the girl with mild, wondering"
17337,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"inquiry. The saddle was harder to manage, but Fayette strained at the"
17338,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"girth till her wrists ached, and hoped all was right."
17339,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17340,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Some faint encouragement came to her, as she saw how gently the mare"
17341,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"behaved. “O, Phœbe, darling,” said Fayette, “you will be good--I know"
17342,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,you will. You are the only one that can help us now.”
17343,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17344,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Petted Phœbe, used to caresses as a house cat, rubbed her dainty head"
17345,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"on Fayette’s shoulder, as if to reassure her."
17346,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17347,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Poor Fayette put up one brief wordless prayer for help and courage, and"
17348,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"then she led Phœbe out of the stable, mounted her by the aid of the"
17349,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"horse-block, and rode away into the night."
17350,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,
17351,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"Sue, watching forlorn, heard the mare’s hoofs beating fainter down the"
17352,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,"road; and relieved that at least Fayette had got off without accident,"
17353,BY CLARA F. GUERNSEY.,listened till the last sound died away on the wind.

17356,CHAPTER II.,CHAPTER II.
17357,CHAPTER II.,
17358,CHAPTER II.,"It was a wild March night. The wind blew loud and cold, though there"
17359,CHAPTER II.,"was in the air a faint breath of spring, and the brooks were coming"
17360,CHAPTER II.,down with fuller currents every hour to swell the Susquehanna. There
17361,CHAPTER II.,"had been heavy rains for the last few days, and the roads were deeply"
17362,CHAPTER II.,"gullied, and somewhat dangerous by night."
17363,CHAPTER II.,
17364,CHAPTER II.,"The wild, white moon, nearly at the full, was plunging swiftly through"
17365,CHAPTER II.,"heavy masses of gray cloud, that at times quite obscured her light, and"
17366,CHAPTER II.,"the solid shapes of hill and wood, and the sweeping, changing shadows"
17367,CHAPTER II.,were so mingled that it was hard to distinguish what was real earth
17368,CHAPTER II.,and what was but the effect of cloud and wind-blown moonshine. All the
17369,CHAPTER II.,twilight world seemed sound and motion.
17370,CHAPTER II.,
17371,CHAPTER II.,"Phœbe, as well as her rider, perhaps, felt some of the influences of"
17372,CHAPTER II.,"the time; for she snorted and turned her head homeward, as if minded"
17373,CHAPTER II.,to return to her warm stable; but she gave way to Fayette’s voice and
17374,CHAPTER II.,"hand, and, striking into a steady pace, picked her way down the steep"
17375,CHAPTER II.,and deeply-furrowed road as soberly as an old cart-horse.
17376,CHAPTER II.,
17377,CHAPTER II.,"The Ford farm-house lay half way up the side of a high hill, and the"
17378,CHAPTER II.,"farm extended into the valley below in pasture and meadow land. Here,"
17379,CHAPTER II.,"for a space, was a hard gravel road; and Fayette, yielding to the spur"
17380,CHAPTER II.,"of the moment, let Phœbe canter, which she was only too willing to do,"
17381,CHAPTER II.,"and was relieved to find how easily she kept her seat, and how gentle"
17382,CHAPTER II.,was the motion.
17383,CHAPTER II.,
17384,CHAPTER II.,"In a few minutes the bounds of the farm were passed, and Fayette’s"
17385,CHAPTER II.,"heart sank low as they drew near the roaring, sounding woods through"
17386,CHAPTER II.,"which the road lay. The trees stood up like a black wall, with one"
17387,CHAPTER II.,"blacker archway, into which the path ran, and was lost in the darkness"
17388,CHAPTER II.,beyond.
17389,CHAPTER II.,
17390,CHAPTER II.,"People who have never been allowed to hear the word “ghost,” who know"
17391,CHAPTER II.,"nothing of popular superstitions, who are strangers to ballad lore"
17392,CHAPTER II.,"and to Walter Scott, will, nevertheless, be often awed and sometimes"
17393,CHAPTER II.,"panic-struck by night, and darkness, and wind, and that power of the"
17394,CHAPTER II.,unseen which laughs Mr. Gradgrind himself to scorn.
17395,CHAPTER II.,
17396,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette, however, had not been properly brought up, according to Mr."
17397,CHAPTER II.,"Gradgrind’s system. She had read all sorts of wild tales, and listened"
17398,CHAPTER II.,"to them from the lips of a Scotch nurse. She knew many a ballad, and"
17399,CHAPTER II.,"many a bit of folk lore, and old paganism,--pleasant enough puppets for"
17400,CHAPTER II.,"imagination to play with under the sunshine, but which now rose up in a"
17401,CHAPTER II.,grim life-likeness quite too real.
17402,CHAPTER II.,
17403,CHAPTER II.,"The owls began to call from the shadows, and once and again came a"
17404,CHAPTER II.,"long, wild scream, which, in the darkness and wind, had an awful sound."
17405,CHAPTER II.,
17406,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette knew perfectly well that it was only a coon calling, but for"
17407,CHAPTER II.,all that it frightened her. There came over her that horrible feeling
17408,CHAPTER II.,which most people have experienced once in their lives at least--the
17409,CHAPTER II.,sense that some unseen pursuer is coming up behind. In a sudden spasm
17410,CHAPTER II.,"of terror, she very nearly gave way to the impulse that urged her to"
17411,CHAPTER II.,rush blindly on anywhere to escape the dread follower. Nerves and
17412,CHAPTER II.,"imagination were running wild; but Fayette, from her earliest years,"
17413,CHAPTER II.,had been trained to self-control and duty. She checked the panic that
17414,CHAPTER II.,"urged her to cry and scream for help. She used her reason, and forced"
17415,CHAPTER II.,"herself to look back and assure her senses that, so far as she could"
17416,CHAPTER II.,"see the dim track, she and Phœbe were the only living creatures there."
17417,CHAPTER II.,
17418,CHAPTER II.,"“I am doing what is right,” she said to herself. “God is here as much"
17419,CHAPTER II.,"as in my room at home. It is folly to fear things that are not real,"
17420,CHAPTER II.,"and as for living beings, not even a wolf could catch me on Phœbe.”"
17421,CHAPTER II.,
17422,CHAPTER II.,"Resolutely rousing her will, she grew more used to her situation, and,"
17423,CHAPTER II.,"more able to control her terrors, she sternly refused to give rein to"
17424,CHAPTER II.,"her frightened fancy. She drew a long breath, however, when once the"
17425,CHAPTER II.,"wood was passed and the road began to climb the opposing hill, behind"
17426,CHAPTER II.,"which, and across the creek, lay Springville. She thought of William"
17427,CHAPTER II.,"of Deloraine and his ride to Melrose, and smiled at the remembrance of"
17428,CHAPTER II.,that matter-of-fact hero.
17429,CHAPTER II.,
17430,CHAPTER II.,"“It’s a good thing, Phœbe, dear, that you and I have no deadly feud"
17431,CHAPTER II.,"with any one,” she said; and then she patted the mare and praised her,"
17432,CHAPTER II.,"and Phœbe, quickening her pace, broke into a gallop, and took the hill"
17433,CHAPTER II.,"road with long, sweeping strides that soon brought them to the summit."
17434,CHAPTER II.,
17435,CHAPTER II.,Fayette began to enjoy the swift motion and a sense of independence and
17436,CHAPTER II.,safety in Phœbe’s gentle compliance with her will; but at the hill-top
17437,CHAPTER II.,"she checked the pace, fearing a stumble down the deeply gullied hill,"
17438,CHAPTER II.,which was still sending rivulets to the creek. The amiable Phœbe chose
17439,CHAPTER II.,"to obey, and picked her way, careful both for herself and her rider."
17440,CHAPTER II.,
17441,CHAPTER II.,"Now rose a new voice on the wind. It was the sound of angry waters, a"
17442,CHAPTER II.,long roar rising louder from time to time.
17443,CHAPTER II.,
17444,CHAPTER II.,“How high the creek must be!” thought Fayette; and as the roar
17445,CHAPTER II.,"increased, she began to have a sort of fear of the bridge, which she"
17446,CHAPTER II.,knew must be crossed; but she classed the feeling with her ghostly
17447,CHAPTER II.,"terrors, and soon found herself drawing near the bridge, the noise of"
17448,CHAPTER II.,the water almost drowning that of the wind.
17449,CHAPTER II.,
17450,CHAPTER II.,"As she came to the bank, a heavy cloud came over the moon, involving"
17451,CHAPTER II.,the whole landscape in sudden and dense blackness; and at that instant
17452,CHAPTER II.,"Phœbe planted her feet like a rock, and refused to stir an inch."
17453,CHAPTER II.,
17454,CHAPTER II.,"In vain Fayette coaxed and urged, for she dared not strike, even if she"
17455,CHAPTER II.,had had a whip. Phœbe was immovable as a horse of bronze; but at last
17456,CHAPTER II.,"she began to pull at the bridle, as though she meant to turn homeward."
17457,CHAPTER II.,
17458,CHAPTER II.,"Just then the moon came out, and Fayette, looking eagerly forward, saw,"
17459,CHAPTER II.,"to her horror, that the bridge was gone. A post and rail only remained,"
17460,CHAPTER II.,and beyond was a chasm where the furious waters had not even left a
17461,CHAPTER II.,wreck behind.
17462,CHAPTER II.,
17463,CHAPTER II.,"Had Phœbe’s senses not been more acute than her own, two steps more"
17464,CHAPTER II.,would have plunged horse and rider into the flood.
17465,CHAPTER II.,
17466,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette turned sick, and felt as if she should fall from the saddle."
17467,CHAPTER II.,"She rallied, however, for she knew she must. Her senses came back in"
17468,CHAPTER II.,"thankfulness to God, and she confessed humbly enough to Phœbe that she"
17469,CHAPTER II.,"had known best; and Phœbe, looking over her shoulder, said, “I told you"
17470,CHAPTER II.,"so,” as plainly as a horse could."
17471,CHAPTER II.,
17472,CHAPTER II.,Fayette was at a loss. A mile further up the stream was another and
17473,CHAPTER II.,much better bridge than the rickety old plank structure that was
17474,CHAPTER II.,"missing; but to reach it she must turn back and make a long detour,"
17475,CHAPTER II.,"that would nearly double her journey, while every minute lessened the"
17476,CHAPTER II.,chances of the sufferer at home.
17477,CHAPTER II.,
17478,CHAPTER II.,[Illustration]
17479,CHAPTER II.,
17480,CHAPTER II.,She knew that just below the bridge was a ford easily passable in
17481,CHAPTER II.,"summer, and she remembered hearing her uncle say that once, when the"
17482,CHAPTER II.,"bridge was down, he had crossed this ford on horseback. It might be"
17483,CHAPTER II.,that even now she and Phœbe could make their way across.
17484,CHAPTER II.,
17485,CHAPTER II.,"A wagon track led down to the water’s edge, and Phœbe did not refuse"
17486,CHAPTER II.,"to follow this path to the stream’s edge, where Fayette checked her,"
17487,CHAPTER II.,afraid to face the passage.
17488,CHAPTER II.,
17489,CHAPTER II.,The creek was coming down ruffled before the wind into waves “crested
17490,CHAPTER II.,"with tawny foam,” and the “wan water” looked eerie and threatening."
17491,CHAPTER II.,
17492,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette refused to think of the water kelpie, who just then obtruded"
17493,CHAPTER II.,himself on her mind. She bent from the saddle and scanned the road.
17494,CHAPTER II.,
17495,CHAPTER II.,"Judging from the traces on the gravel, she thought that a wagon must"
17496,CHAPTER II.,"have passed not many hours before. Her courage rose, and she set her"
17497,CHAPTER II.,will to the task before her.
17498,CHAPTER II.,
17499,CHAPTER II.,"“If Phœbe thinks it safe, I’ll try it,” she said; and as the rein hung"
17500,CHAPTER II.,"loose, Phœbe stepped cautiously in. She seemed doubtful at first, but"
17501,CHAPTER II.,"she went on, and the water rose and rose."
17502,CHAPTER II.,
17503,CHAPTER II.,"The moon cast an uncertain, wavering light on the dancing stream; the"
17504,CHAPTER II.,"roar filled Fayette’s ears like a threatening voice; the waves, as"
17505,CHAPTER II.,"they plunged toward her, seemed hands raised to pull her down; and"
17506,CHAPTER II.,"still Phœbe stepped steadily on, and the stream came higher and higher."
17507,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette drew up her feet as far as she could, and glanced back to the"
17508,CHAPTER II.,"shore, half minded to turn; but it was now as far to one bank as to the"
17509,CHAPTER II.,other. The water touched her feet; it flowed over them.
17510,CHAPTER II.,
17511,CHAPTER II.,"The next instant she scarcely checked the shriek that rose to her lips,"
17512,CHAPTER II.,"for she felt that the mare no longer touched bottom, but was swimming"
17513,CHAPTER II.,for her life and her rider’s.
17514,CHAPTER II.,
17515,CHAPTER II.,At the real danger her ghostly terrors fled. With a sense of wonder she
17516,CHAPTER II.,"felt her mind grow calm, her courage rise, her senses wake to their"
17517,CHAPTER II.,work.
17518,CHAPTER II.,
17519,CHAPTER II.,"To her relief she saw that Phœbe had not lost her wits, but was keeping"
17520,CHAPTER II.,"straight across the creek. She let the mare take her own way, only"
17521,CHAPTER II.,helping her as far as she could by keeping her head in the way she
17522,CHAPTER II.,wished to go. She thought of nothing but the minute’s need; and of all
17523,CHAPTER II.,"the possibilities before her, the only fear that shaped itself in her"
17524,CHAPTER II.,mind was one for her horse.
17525,CHAPTER II.,
17526,CHAPTER II.,"The current was strong, but so was Phœbe, and her blood was up. She"
17527,CHAPTER II.,"snorted fiercely, as if angry with the force that crossed her will, and"
17528,CHAPTER II.,"putting out her strength, she breasted the storm gallantly."
17529,CHAPTER II.,
17530,CHAPTER II.,"It was but a minute, though it seemed an hour to Fayette, before she"
17531,CHAPTER II.,touched bottom.
17532,CHAPTER II.,
17533,CHAPTER II.,"The water sank rapidly, and she reached the shore but a little below"
17534,CHAPTER II.,the usual landing. The bank came down to the stream with a somewhat
17535,CHAPTER II.,"steep incline; but mountain-bred Phœbe planted her fore feet firmly,"
17536,CHAPTER II.,"scrambled cat-like up the incline, shook the clinging water from hide"
17537,CHAPTER II.,"and mane, and with a joyous whinny, rushed like an arrow on the track."
17538,CHAPTER II.,
17539,CHAPTER II.,"The way was plain before her, and in a minute or two more Fayette, with"
17540,CHAPTER II.,"some trouble, checked Phœbe’s gallop at Dr. Ward’s gate. A light was"
17541,CHAPTER II.,burning over the office door.
17542,CHAPTER II.,
17543,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette slipped from the saddle, but before she turned to the house,"
17544,CHAPTER II.,"she put her arms round Phœbe’s neck, and kissed the white star on her"
17545,CHAPTER II.,"forehead. As she ran up the walk, she felt, for the first time, that"
17546,CHAPTER II.,"she was wet nearly to her knees, and the wind made her shiver."
17547,CHAPTER II.,
17548,CHAPTER II.,"She rang the bell sharply, and to her relief the door was opened"
17549,CHAPTER II.,"directly by Dr. Ward himself, who had just come in."
17550,CHAPTER II.,
17551,CHAPTER II.,"Hurriedly, but clearly, Fayette told her story."
17552,CHAPTER II.,
17553,CHAPTER II.,"“Yes, I understand,” said Dr. Ward. “But, dear me,” he added, as the"
17554,CHAPTER II.,"light fell on her more clearly, “where have you been to get so wet?”"
17555,CHAPTER II.,
17556,CHAPTER II.,"“In the water,” said Fayette. “The creek is so high, and the bridge is"
17557,CHAPTER II.,down.”
17558,CHAPTER II.,
17559,CHAPTER II.,“Child! You did not ride that ford to-night?”
17560,CHAPTER II.,
17561,CHAPTER II.,"“Not all the way, sir. Phœbe swam.”"
17562,CHAPTER II.,
17563,CHAPTER II.,"“Phœbe, indeed! A pretty pair are you and Phœbe to race round the"
17564,CHAPTER II.,"country at midnight. Go to Mrs. Ward and get some dry clothes, while my"
17565,CHAPTER II.,man gets out the gig.”
17566,CHAPTER II.,
17567,CHAPTER II.,"“O, sir, please be quick.”"
17568,CHAPTER II.,
17569,CHAPTER II.,"“Yes, yes; only get off those wet things. Let Phœbe stay here till"
17570,CHAPTER II.,"to-morrow, for my old gig can’t swim the creek, whatever you and the"
17571,CHAPTER II.,mare can do. We must go by the upper bridge.”
17572,CHAPTER II.,
17573,CHAPTER II.,"Mrs. Ward, called out of bed, supplied Fayette with dry things, and"
17574,CHAPTER II.,"Phœbe was consigned to the doctor’s admiring colored man, to be well"
17575,CHAPTER II.,cared for before she took possession of her bed in the warm stable.
17576,CHAPTER II.,
17577,CHAPTER II.,"The doctor kept a trotter for emergencies, and in an hour and a half"
17578,CHAPTER II.,from the time she had left home Fayette came back.
17579,CHAPTER II.,
17580,CHAPTER II.,"Sue came to meet them, white and scared; and, as she came, Fayette"
17581,CHAPTER II.,"heard a cry of anguish, which she knew that nothing but the direst"
17582,CHAPTER II.,"extremity could have wrung from her strong, self-controlled aunt."
17583,CHAPTER II.,
17584,CHAPTER II.,"The doctor took out his ether flask and sponge, and hurried to the"
17585,CHAPTER II.,bedside.
17586,CHAPTER II.,
17587,CHAPTER II.,Before long the ministering spirit did its good office. The tortured
17588,CHAPTER II.,"nerves relaxed, and the patient slept."
17589,CHAPTER II.,
17590,CHAPTER II.,"Fayette put on her wrapper, and curled herself up on the sofa, leaving"
17591,CHAPTER II.,Sue and the doctor watching by the fire.
17592,CHAPTER II.,
17593,CHAPTER II.,When she woke it was broad daylight. All seemed quiet about the house.
17594,CHAPTER II.,"She stole across the floor, and looked into her aunt’s room. Mrs. Ford"
17595,CHAPTER II.,"was awake, and held out her hand."
17596,CHAPTER II.,
17597,CHAPTER II.,"“Is the pain gone, aunt?” asked Fayette, kissing her, and feeling a new"
17598,CHAPTER II.,love rising in her heart.
17599,CHAPTER II.,
17600,CHAPTER II.,"“Yes, child; but I am very weak.”"
17601,CHAPTER II.,
17602,CHAPTER II.,"“It was the ether saved your life, I really think,” said Fayette, to"
17603,CHAPTER II.,whom the past night seemed like a dream.
17604,CHAPTER II.,
17605,CHAPTER II.,"“No, my dear,” said Mrs. Ford. “It was you.”"

17698,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17699,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17700,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Nowadays nearly every school-room is furnished with a waste-paper
17701,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"basket, dust-pan and brush, with which the pupils are expected to keep"
17702,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the room tidy. But in the days when Patty Curtis went to school in the
17703,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"old brick school-house in Sagetown, such luxuries were unheard of, and"
17704,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the school-room during the greater part of the day was a haven for
17705,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"dirt--rather clean dirt it was, but it answered the definition which"
17706,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"says, “Dirt is matter out of place.”"
17707,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17708,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Certainly the school-room floor was no place for the scraps of paper
17709,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"over which Patty industriously scribbled with her stubby lead-pencil,"
17710,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,but it was there she dropped them without thought of wrong-doing or
17711,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,idea of further responsibility for her manuscript fragments. Cores of
17712,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"haws and crab-apples, and shells of “pig-nuts” found the same resting"
17713,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"place, and soiled slate-rags were in such abundance as would have"
17714,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"delighted the heart of any “old rag man;” during flower season, too, a"
17715,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,desk proudly adorned with fresh flowers in the morning meant a floor
17716,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"sadly strewed with wilted, trodden fragments in the afternoon, and over"
17717,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,all this litter was plentifully sprinkled the dust of the earth. Of
17718,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"this we are all supposed to be made, and it needs but little faith to"
17719,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"believe that children are made of it, when one sees, in a school-room,"
17720,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the quantity of it they can kick off their feet, and shake out of"
17721,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,their jackets and skirts.
17722,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17723,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,The services of a janitor were as unknown to the old school-house
17724,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"as were the basket, dust-pan and brush; the teacher was expected to"
17725,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"do the sweeping herself. This, Miss Kelsey, Patty’s new teacher one"
17726,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"spring term, found no pleasant ending to a hard day’s work. The desks"
17727,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"and seats were awkwardly constructed, and placed very close together;"
17728,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"if Miss Kelsey tried to sweep without looking under them, she found"
17729,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"she left more dirt than she swept out, and if she thrust both head"
17730,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"and broom under the seat, in order to see what she was doing, she was"
17731,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"sure to bump her head, and “jab” herself with the broom-handle, and in"
17732,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"either case she came out of the school-room tired and hot, and choked"
17733,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,with dust.
17734,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17735,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"It is not strange, then, that she had not done the sweeping many days"
17736,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,before she came to the conclusion:
17737,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17738,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“It is the children who make all this labor necessary, and it is but"
17739,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,right that they should do it themselves; they are little and active
17740,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,and could sweep under these troublesome seats more easily than I can;
17741,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"besides the girls will soon have such work to do at home, and their"
17742,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,mothers will be glad to have them learn to do it here.”
17743,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17744,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,So one evening when both hands on the little round clock pointed to
17745,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"IV., and thirty-six boys and girls were waiting the tap at the bell"
17746,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"that should dismiss them, Miss Kelsey spoke:"
17747,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17748,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,“I have decided to ask you children to do the sweeping for me
17749,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"hereafter, and I will choose two each evening from your names, as they"
17750,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"stand on my register, to do the work. To-night Sarah Adams and Aggie"
17751,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Bentley may sweep. There are two brooms, one girl can take the boys’"
17752,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"side and the other the girls’ side of the room, and you will soon"
17753,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,finish the sweeping.”
17754,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17755,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"For a moment each pupil eyed the dirty floor, and tried to decide"
17756,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,whether or not sweeping was a desirable piece of work. Sarah Adams very
17757,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"soon decided to her satisfaction that it was not, and she raised her"
17758,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,hand.
17759,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17760,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Well, Sarah?” said Miss Kelsey."
17761,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17762,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Please, Miss Kelsey, mother’s at a quiltin’ at Deacon Smith’s, and"
17763,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"she told me to come home as soon as school was out, and help Nancy get"

17765,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17766,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Sarah was the oldest girl in school, and Miss Kelsey knew that in"
17767,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"whatever she led the other children were sure to follow, but she did"
17768,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,not want to offend Mrs. Adams by refusing to allow Sarah to go home
17769,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"when school was dismissed, so she reluctantly said:"
17770,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17771,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Well, then, I suppose I will have to excuse you. Hattie Bitner may"
17772,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"take your place to-night, and you can sweep to-morrow night.”"
17773,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17774,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Up went Hattie’s hand as if worked by a spring. “Miss Kelsey, mother’s"
17775,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"making soap, and she told me to come home right away as soon as school"
17776,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,was out to tend the baby.”
17777,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17778,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"It was natural, though perhaps not wise, for Miss Kelsey to lose"
17779,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,patience at this point.
17780,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17781,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Then,” said she, “you may go immediately, and mind you run every step"
17782,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"of the way. Well, Patty Curtis, what is your mother doing that you"
17783,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,cannot stay to sweep?”
17784,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17785,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Now, Patty had been trying during all of the previous dialogue to think"
17786,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,if there was not something that her mother might possibly want her to
17787,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"do after school, by which she might escape the sweeping, but all in"
17788,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"vain, for Patty’s mother was one of the women who “never want children"
17789,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"bothering around about the work,” and as Patty was too conscientious to"
17790,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"invent an excuse, as some children would have done, she had no answer"
17791,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"for Miss Kelsey’s question except a rather sulky, “Nothing that I know"
17792,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"of, ma’am.”"
17793,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17794,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Then you and Aggie Bentley take the brooms when the others are gone,”"
17795,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"said Miss Kelsey, as she tapped the bell."
17796,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17797,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Aggie Bentley was one of the pleasantest little girls in the world;
17798,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"when appointed to sweep she did not think of trying to evade the duty,"
17799,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"it was enough for her that her teacher had asked her to do it, and"
17800,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,she took the broom so cheerfully and went to work with such a vim
17801,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"that Patty was shamed out of her unwillingness, and soon was swinging"
17802,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the broom as briskly and as awkwardly as was Aggie. Still it was not
17803,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"a pleasant task, and when she came out of the school-room, coughing,"
17804,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"sneezing, and wiping the dust out of her eyes, she found words for her"
17805,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,disgust:
17806,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17807,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,“Ugh! Nasty work! I’m glad there’s thirty-four more to sweep before it
17808,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"comes our turn again. Let’s see, thirty-four, two at a time, that’s"
17809,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"seventeen days. Nearly a month before we’ll have to sweep again, Aggie!”"
17810,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17811,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"But Patty was doomed to disappointment, for at the moment she was"
17812,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"making this clearly expressed calculation, Miss Kelsey was also giving"
17813,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the sweeping question serious thought.
17814,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17815,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,“It is going to be a hard matter to persuade these children to do
17816,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the sweeping,” thought she. “I suppose most of the mothers can find"
17817,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"something for them to do, and the little rogues who have always"
17818,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"loitered and played half an hour or more on their way home, will come"
17819,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"to-morrow with a fine assortment of excuses, all to the effect that"
17820,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,they must be at home immediately after school. I think I had better
17821,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,change the plan and make the sweeping a punishment for whispering.
17822,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,They will not care to tell their parents that they are detained for
17823,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"misdemeanors, and it will put a check on the whispering too.”"
17824,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17825,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,So the next morning as soon as school opened she told the pupils she
17826,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"should appoint to the sweeping, that night, the first two that she"
17827,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,should see whispering.
17828,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17829,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“O, my goodness gracious!” said thoughtless Flindy Jenkins to herself"
17830,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"in a loud whisper, “I’ll get caught sure.” And sure enough she did, for"
17831,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,down went her name in Miss Kelsey’s “black book.”
17832,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17833,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Whispering was Patty’s besetting sin, and on hearing Miss Kelsey’s"
17834,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"decision she buttoned up her mouth very tightly indeed, and resolved"
17835,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"not to open it again until some one else was caught, and she would no"
17836,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,doubt have kept this politic resolution had she not soon after spied
17837,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,little Biddy Maginnis in the act of whisking out of a knot-hole in the
17838,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"desk a bunch of violets that Patty had, a short time before, fastened"
17839,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,there. They were the first violets of the season and Biddy wanted to
17840,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"smell of them, but Patty did not like to have her treasures so roughly"
17841,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,handled and in the excitement of a moment forgot everything else.
17842,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17843,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Give those back here,” she said, fiercely, and almost aloud."
17844,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17845,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Patty Curtis,” said Miss Kelsey, as she wrote her name under that of"
17846,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Flindy Jenkins, “I am sorry to say that you will have to sweep again"
17847,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"to-night.” And Patty with a gasp of shame and surprise, sank back into"
17848,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,her seat with her rescued flowers.
17849,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17850,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“It’s too bad,” she said to herself as she heard the children around"
17851,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"her giggle, and in spite of her efforts the tears chased each other"
17852,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"down her cheeks, giving the pretty violets a salt bath. The tears"
17853,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"stopped after a while, but Patty did not recover from her vexation: she"
17854,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"sulked all day, and was sulky still when she took the broom in hand"
17855,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"after school. She would show Miss Kelsey, she thought in her naughty"
17856,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"little heart, that the school-room would look but precious little"
17857,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,better for her being kept to sweep it.
17858,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17859,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Flindy Jenkins was a poor companion for a little girl in such a frame
17860,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"of mind, and she really fell in with Patty’s suggestion that they sweep"
17861,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,so the school-room should “look like Biddy Maginnises’ house in the
17862,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Hollow;” and when Miss Kelsey came to school early the next morning
17863,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"she found the room looking worse, if possible, than if it had not been"
17864,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,swept at all.
17865,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17866,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,That afternoon Miss Kelsey sat at her desk thinking so intently about
17867,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the sweeping, that she did not see Aggie Bentley standing beside her"
17868,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,until the little girl spoke timidly:
17869,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17870,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Please, Miss Kelsey, may Patty Curtis and I go out and play a little"
17871,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,while? we have got all our lessons.”
17872,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17873,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Miss Kelsey glanced over to Patty and saw an eager face shadowed by
17874,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"a very doubting expression, for the little girl knew she deserved no"
17875,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,play-time after her conduct of the night before. So she was surprised
17876,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"to see Miss Kelsey’s face brighten, and to hear her give a cordial"
17877,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,consent. The truth was that Miss Kelsey had suddenly solved the
17878,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,problem that had been troubling her for several days. Offer as reward
17879,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"to the two that would sweep, a half hour’s extra recess when lessons"
17880,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,were learned! Why had she not thought of it before? for if there was
17881,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"anything more coveted than “reward cards,” it was these “half hours.”"
17882,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Before school closed she made a simple statement of her new plan, and"
17883,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,was amused to see what an electrifying effect it had upon the children;
17884,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,and when they were dismissed what a scramble there was for the brooms!
17885,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"if there had been thirty-six of these, thirty-six children would soon"
17886,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,have been sweeping away at the floor of the little school-room; as
17887,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"there were but two, great was the pulling and twisting they received,"
17888,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,and loud the uproar among those who wanted to use them. The trouble was
17889,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"soon settled by Miss Kelsey, who took possession of the brooms and said"
17890,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the two should sweep who came first in the morning.
17891,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17892,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Patty Curtis was now in luck, for the fact that her mother had nothing"
17893,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"for her to do at home, which had been such a draw-back to her before,"
17894,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,would be the greatest help now; she could come to the school-house as
17895,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"early as she liked while other little girls had to wash dishes, or rock"
17896,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"cradles, and the boys had wood to split and cows to drive to pasture."
17897,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17898,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"The next morning Patty was the first one at the school-house, and she"
17899,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"had nearly finished half the sweeping when Sarah Adams came, so she"
17900,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,and Sarah had the half hour play together. Sarah was two years older
17901,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"than Patty, and a very quarrelsome girl, and she and Patty succeeded"
17902,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,in quarelling so over the play-house they were building that neither
17903,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,little girl got much enjoyment from the reward of her labor.
17904,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17905,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"As Patty intended to sweep the next morning, and did not want Sarah"
17906,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"for a playmate, she lingered after school was dismissed to make"
17907,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,arrangements with Aggie Bentley to assist her. They agreed that Aggie
17908,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,was to prevail upon her indulgent mother to allow her to start for
17909,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,school as soon as she ate her breakfast. Patty was to go at the same
17910,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"time, and they would have the sweeping done before Sarah, or any one"
17911,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"else, should arrive."
17912,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17913,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,But when the two little girls went into the entry to get their
17914,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,sunbonnets they noticed that the brooms were gone from the corner where
17915,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,they always stood.
17916,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17917,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Perhaps they have been carried out of doors,” said Patty, and she"
17918,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"looked out on the steps and in various possible and impossible places,"
17919,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,but in vain; then she went into the house and told Miss Kelsey that the
17920,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"brooms were gone, and Miss Kelsey helped the little girls search. At"
17921,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,last they all gave up. Then the teacher spoke:
17922,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17923,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“I suspect, Patty, some of the pupils think you have done enough"
17924,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"sweeping for a while, and want to give you a rest, so have hidden the"
17925,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"brooms. Never mind, you will have many more chances to do the sweeping,"
17926,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,and besides you ought not to want all the half hours for yourself.”
17927,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17928,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,But this did not comfort Patty very much; you will see she was rather
17929,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"a selfish little girl, and she did want all the half hours, as well as"
17930,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"all other obtainable good things, for herself."
17931,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17932,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“It is that Sarah Adams who has hid them brooms,” she said to Aggie as"
17933,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"they walked home together, “and she has just done it for spite. I wish"
17934,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"I could think of some way to get ahead of her, but I can’t.”"
17935,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17936,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Well, we won’t have to go to school so early,” said Aggie; “you come"
17937,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,over to my house and we will have a nice play before the bell rings.”
17938,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17939,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Before dark, however, Patty had thought of a way to “get ahead” of"
17940,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"Sarah Adams. This was simply, to take a broom with her when she went to"
17941,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,school the next morning. But a lion in the form of Patty’s mother stood
17942,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,in the way of her getting a broom; Patty knew she would never allow one
17943,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,to be taken away from home; if Patty took one she must take it without
17944,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,permission. Now there were but two brooms in the house; one stood in
17945,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,the kitchen and was in such constant use that Patty knew it would be
17946,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,missed long before she could return it; the other was kept in the hall
17947,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"closet and was used once a week, in sweeping the parlor and “spare"
17948,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"room,” and the day before had been the regular sweeping day. This she"
17949,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"must take if she took either, altho’ she knew she should not, but she"
17950,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,did not allow herself time enough to think about it to be persuaded
17951,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"out of the notion; she took the broom from the closet, and in the"
17952,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,gathering darkness carried it to a hiding place between the wood shed
17953,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"and the pig-pen, and then went to bed to be tormented all night with"
17954,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,visions of her mother’s best broom:--an old beggar woman stole it away;
17955,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"a black witch mounted it, and rode to the moon, never to return; and"
17956,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"lastly, Sarah Adams found it, and knowing Patty intended sweeping with"
17957,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"it burned it up before her very eyes. Patty was glad when morning came,"
17958,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"and she hurried out to assure herself of the safety of the broom, as"
17959,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,soon as she was dressed. When she had eaten her breakfast she started
17960,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"to school with the broom, and stopped for Aggie Bentley. Aggie found an"
17961,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,old broom which her mother said she might take. They swept and dusted
17962,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the room in high glee, and Patty had perched herself upon one of the"
17963,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"front desks, and sat kicking her heels in triumph, when Sarah Adams and"
17964,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Hattie Bitner entered with the hidden brooms.
17965,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17966,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Needn’t mind sweeping this morning, girls,” said Patty; “and the next"
17967,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,time you hide brooms you’d better hide all in Sagetown.”
17968,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17969,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“I’ll pay you up, miss,” said Sarah, when she had recovered from her"
17970,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"astonishment, and she and Hattie threw down their brooms and left the"
17971,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,room in high wrath.
17972,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17973,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,Some way Patty did not enjoy her half hour play that morning; she was
17974,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,fearful that she might not be able to get her mother’s broom back into
17975,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the house without being discovered, and Sarah’s threat troubled her;"
17976,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,what means Sarah would take to get her into trouble she could not
17977,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,imagine.
17978,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17979,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"That evening as Patty sat at home, swinging back and forth in her"
17980,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"little rocking-chair, who should come to make her a visit but Sarah;"
17981,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,that hypocritical young woman was as smiling and as amiable as
17982,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"possible, but she declined all of Patty’s invitations to “go out and"
17983,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"play;” this made Patty uneasy, she wished Sarah would go home. Pretty"
17984,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"soon Patty’s mother came in and sat down, and Sarah immediately began"
17985,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,talking about school and Miss Kelsey’s plans for the sweeping. Patty
17986,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,grew still more uneasy and made another effort to get Sarah out of
17987,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"doors, but when Sarah said--"
17988,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17989,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,“My mother said she thought it was so queer that Mrs. Curtis should
17990,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,let Patty take a new broom from home to sweep that dirty school-house
17991,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"with,”--then Patty resigned herself to her fate."
17992,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17993,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,“Patty Curtis! you don’t mean to say that you took my best broom to
17994,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"the school-house,” said Mrs. Curtis, dropping her knitting in her"
17995,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,astonishment.
17996,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
17997,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Yes I did,” said Patty; “but I wouldn’t, if that mean thing there"
17998,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,hadn’t hid the brooms.”
17999,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18000,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“And I,” said Sarah, “wouldn’t have hid ’em, if you hadn’t been so"
18001,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,stingy as to want all the play-times yourself.”
18002,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18003,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“There, that will do for you both,” said Mrs. Curtis. “Patty, you may"
18004,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"get yourself a bowl of bread and milk for your supper, and go to bed"
18005,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,immediately.”
18006,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18007,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"This, Mrs. Curtis considered a very light punishment; it would have"
18008,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,been much heavier if her motherly indignation had not been a little
18009,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,stirred against Sarah for playing informer; but to Patty it was hard
18010,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"enough, for she had intended going out on the common with the girls,"
18011,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"late in the evening, for a game of “black man” by the light of the"
18012,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"rising moon; and as she eat her bread and milk, crying quietly to"
18013,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"herself, she heard Sarah’s taunting voice under the window:"
18014,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18015,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Don’t you wish you’d let me sweep, so you could play ‘black man’"
18016,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,to-night?”
18017,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18018,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"“Don’t care,” answered Patty; “I had a play when you didn’t, and I’ll"
18019,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,have another to-morrow.”
18020,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,
18021,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"So she did, and though Miss Kelsey interfered to prevent Patty from"
18022,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"having a monopoly of the sweeping, still she did it so often that"
18023,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"before the term closed she became a famous sweeper, and her mother"
18024,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,actually allowed her to take charge of the sweeping of the sitting-room
18025,BY MRS. M. L. EVANS.,"at home, and was not at all sorry that Miss Kelsey had proved such a"

18090,BY G. B. BARTLETT.,"must soon become a very popular and amusing pastime for old and young,"
18091,BY G. B. BARTLETT.,"for the appliances are very simple and any one can play it, while with"
18092,BY G. B. BARTLETT.,practice great skill will be developed. At present there is only one
18093,BY G. B. BARTLETT.,set of this game in America; but the readers of the WIDE AWAKE will
18094,BY G. B. BARTLETT.,need to try it but once to appreciate and enjoy it.

18098,BOGGIA.,
18099,BOGGIA.,"The game of Boggia requires one black ball, nine white balls, and nine"
18100,BOGGIA.,colored balls. Croquet balls will answer; but those of hard wood are
18101,BOGGIA.,"better, since they are heavier; still if made of light wood, melted"
18102,BOGGIA.,lead can be poured into holes made with a gimlet until they weigh about
18103,BOGGIA.,one-half pound each.
18104,BOGGIA.,
18105,BOGGIA.,"Any even number can play, from two to eighteen persons."
18106,BOGGIA.,
18107,BOGGIA.,The players are divided into two equal sides. The colored balls are
18108,BOGGIA.,"divided among the players of one side, and the white balls among the"
18109,BOGGIA.,players of the other side.
18110,BOGGIA.,
18111,BOGGIA.,At first the players choose by lot which shall have the first roll;
18112,BOGGIA.,but in all future games the side that wins has the first roll. To make
18113,BOGGIA.,"this choice, the leader of one side holds behind him a colored in one"
18114,BOGGIA.,"hand, and a white ball in the other; and the leader of the other side"
18115,BOGGIA.,"guesses, right or left. If he guesses the hand which holds the color of"
18116,BOGGIA.,"his own side he gains the right to begin the game; if not, the other"
18117,BOGGIA.,side begins. The leader first rolls the black ball on the lawn to such
18118,BOGGIA.,"a distance as he chooses, from a starting-line. Upon this starting-line"
18119,BOGGIA.,every player must place his right foot when he rolls; this line extends
18120,BOGGIA.,"across the lawn at least twenty feet, and the player can roll from any"
18121,BOGGIA.,"part of it, as it is often desirable to roll from different angles."
18122,BOGGIA.,
18123,BOGGIA.,"The leader then rolls a white ball, trying to have it stop as close as"
18124,BOGGIA.,possible to the black ball.
18125,BOGGIA.,
18126,BOGGIA.,The leader of the other side then rolls a colored ball; his object
18127,BOGGIA.,"being to come in closer, or to knock away either the black ball or the"
18128,BOGGIA.,white ball.
18129,BOGGIA.,
18130,BOGGIA.,The players of each side play alternately--a white and a color--and the
18131,BOGGIA.,"luck constantly changes; for as, at the close of the game, all balls of"
18132,BOGGIA.,one side count which are nearer to the black than any ball of the other
18133,BOGGIA.,"side, a lucky roll may change the whole result by coming in closer, or"
18134,BOGGIA.,"by knocking away either black, white, or colored balls."
18135,BOGGIA.,
18136,BOGGIA.,"Great skill can be used, as, if the ball is too swift, it goes beyond"
18137,BOGGIA.,"all the balls unless it hits and scatters them; if too light, it fails"
18138,BOGGIA.,to come in near the black. Great excitement always attends the last
18139,BOGGIA.,"roll, as a good player who knows the ground can often change the whole"
18140,BOGGIA.,"aspect of the game for the advantage of his own side, and a careless"
18141,BOGGIA.,one often throws the game into the hands of the opposite by knocking
18142,BOGGIA.,away the balls belonging to his own side.
18143,BOGGIA.,

18164,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Bang, _bang_, _bang!_ went Philip Sullivan’s hammer, as he pounded on"
18165,BY MARY DENSEL.,his sled “Chain Lightning.” “Chain Lightning” had needed mending ever
18166,BY MARY DENSEL.,"since last winter, but Phil had concluded not to touch it till “just"
18167,BY MARY DENSEL.,before the snow came.”
18168,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18169,BY MARY DENSEL.,“Never do to-day what you can put off until to-morrow.”
18170,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18171,BY MARY DENSEL.,The consequence was that the north wind suddenly puffed up a midnight
18172,BY MARY DENSEL.,"storm, and Master Phil was awakened one morning by the shouts of the"
18173,BY MARY DENSEL.,"six Dyke boys, who were coasting merrily down “Sullivan Hill.”"
18174,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18175,BY MARY DENSEL.,Phil was out of bed in a twinkling. Ten o’clock found him still working
18176,BY MARY DENSEL.,"fiercely on “Chain Lightning,” his glue-pot simmering before the fire"
18177,BY MARY DENSEL.,in company with his father’s best chisel and his mother’s machine
18178,BY MARY DENSEL.,oil-can.
18179,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18180,BY MARY DENSEL.,The shouts of the Dyke boys still resounded; and not only their
18181,BY MARY DENSEL.,jubilation but that of forty more coasters drove Phil nearly frantic.
18182,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18183,BY MARY DENSEL.,"With all his might Phil worked on, and “Chain Lightning” was beginning"
18184,BY MARY DENSEL.,"to look as if it might hold its own even among newer sleds, when the"
18185,BY MARY DENSEL.,"door leading into the library opened softly, and fair-haired Rosabel,"
18186,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Phil’s sister, appeared on the threshold. At the same moment an"
18187,BY MARY DENSEL.,"opposite door flew open with a jerk, and there stood Rosabel “done in"
18188,BY MARY DENSEL.,"sepia,” as it were; little brown Kate, Rosabel’s twin-sister."
18189,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18190,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Phil glanced up, and then became more than ever absorbed in his work."
18191,BY MARY DENSEL.,There was a peculiar expression on the twins’ faces. Phil instantly
18192,BY MARY DENSEL.,"recognized it. “The _errand_ cast of features,” he grimly called it."
18193,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18194,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Phil, dear,” began Rosabel."
18195,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18196,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Phil, dear,” echoed Kate."
18197,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18198,BY MARY DENSEL.,Phil handled a screw-driver dextrously.
18199,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18200,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Phil, dear, will you please run over to the station and see if my new"
18201,BY MARY DENSEL.,"skates have come by the twelve-o’clock train? Go when the cars are due,"
18202,BY MARY DENSEL.,won’t you?”
18203,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18204,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“And Phil, dear,” chimed in Kate, “can’t you manage to go into the city"
18205,BY MARY DENSEL.,to-day and call for a roll of music which is to be left for me at Hale
18206,BY MARY DENSEL.,and McPherson’s?”
18207,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18208,BY MARY DENSEL.,Now could anything be more trying to the temper of the average youth
18209,BY MARY DENSEL.,"than requests like these, made under the existing circumstances?"
18210,BY MARY DENSEL.,Perhaps some of us may find it in our hearts to forgive Phil for
18211,BY MARY DENSEL.,answering with a certain touch of asperity:
18212,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18213,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Don’t ‘Phil dear’ me! I’m not going to the station, and I’m not going"
18214,BY MARY DENSEL.,"to the city, and--”"
18215,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18216,BY MARY DENSEL.,"_Bang, bang, bang!_ the hammer expressed the rest of his sentiments."
18217,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18218,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Rosabel arched her eyebrows, and mildly withdrew."
18219,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18220,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Kate tarried to wheedle the enemy a bit, and, that failing, gave it as"
18221,BY MARY DENSEL.,her opinion that boys ought never to have been created. Departing she
18222,BY MARY DENSEL.,"closed the door with more force than was strictly needful, and left"
18223,BY MARY DENSEL.,Phil alone.
18224,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18225,BY MARY DENSEL.,That individual worked on in an injured and gloomy frame of mind.
18226,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18227,BY MARY DENSEL.,“Mean enough in them to be forever nagging me. Mean enough in me not to
18228,BY MARY DENSEL.,get their skates and music.”
18229,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18230,BY MARY DENSEL.,"It was hard for Phil to decide which was the greater wretch, himself"
18231,BY MARY DENSEL.,"or Kate. Rosabel, he concluded, could never be a “blot on the earth,”"
18232,BY MARY DENSEL.,whatever she did. It was Rosabel who had helped him write his
18233,BY MARY DENSEL.,composition on “Spring;” it was Rosabel who knit his mittens; it was
18234,BY MARY DENSEL.,Rosabel who never shirked her share of the stirring when they made
18235,BY MARY DENSEL.,molasses candy.
18236,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18237,BY MARY DENSEL.,The remembrance of Rosabel’s virtues haunted Phil even after “Chain
18238,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Lightning” was in order, and he was shooting down “Sullivan Hill,”"
18239,BY MARY DENSEL.,"lying prone on his sled, with his legs waving in the air."
18240,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18241,BY MARY DENSEL.,Perhaps that was the reason that when his elder brother Will came
18242,BY MARY DENSEL.,hastily up the hill and offered him five cents if he would carry a
18243,BY MARY DENSEL.,bundle to a store next the railway station (you see that Phil was
18244,BY MARY DENSEL.,"regarded as the family errand boy), he condescended to saunter in that"
18245,BY MARY DENSEL.,"direction. Not that he cared for the pennies, although he accepted them"
18246,BY MARY DENSEL.,as a token of brotherly esteem.
18247,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18248,BY MARY DENSEL.,"He even quickened his pace as a shrill whistle sounded in the distance,"
18249,BY MARY DENSEL.,and ended by racing up to the depot just as the twelve-o’clock train
18250,BY MARY DENSEL.,stopped.
18251,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18252,BY MARY DENSEL.,No one seemed to know about Rosabel’s skates.
18253,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18254,BY MARY DENSEL.,“Ask the man in the express office--perhaps they came on an earlier
18255,BY MARY DENSEL.,"train,” suggested Fred Rodman, who was standing on the platform. “I’ll"
18256,BY MARY DENSEL.,"keep your sled for you. Or, see here, just slip the rope through this"

18258,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18259,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Phil did as he was bidden, and leaving his sharp-shooter tied with a"
18260,BY MARY DENSEL.,"slip-knot, went into the express office."
18261,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18262,BY MARY DENSEL.,The man in the express office had never heard the proverb concerning
18263,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“a place for everything;” or, if he had, knowing it was not among the"
18264,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Ten Commandments, felt under no obligation to heed it. He remarked that"
18265,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“somebody had said something about some skates being somewhere,” and"
18266,BY MARY DENSEL.,"went fumbling among boxes and bundles, exclaiming alternately, “Hi!"

18272,BY MARY DENSEL.,"next to sure that here were the skates, the engine bell rang, there was"
18273,BY MARY DENSEL.,"a slight scurry outside, and the train began to move."
18274,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18275,BY MARY DENSEL.,Phil was out of the depot in a flash.
18276,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18277,BY MARY DENSEL.,“Stop!” he cried; but the locomotive paid no heed.
18278,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18279,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Slowly past the platform glided the cars, pulling “Chain Lightning”"
18280,BY MARY DENSEL.,behind.
18281,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18282,BY MARY DENSEL.,"Almost before he knew what he was doing, Phil had thrown himself on"
18283,BY MARY DENSEL.,the sled and grasped its rope. To his horror the slip-knot suddenly
18284,BY MARY DENSEL.,"tightened, and “Chain Lightning” was firmly fastened. Every moment the"
18285,BY MARY DENSEL.,train quickened its speed.
18286,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18287,BY MARY DENSEL.,"I should not dare to tell the rest of this story, were it not true. I"
18288,BY MARY DENSEL.,am not “making it up.” It really happened.
18289,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18290,BY MARY DENSEL.,The sled hung on the car. Phil Sullivan clung to the sled. Do you
18291,BY MARY DENSEL.,suppose he would lose “Chain Lightning?” Not he.
18292,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18293,BY MARY DENSEL.,Faster and faster--faster and faster still--dashed on the train. Over
18294,BY MARY DENSEL.,"the sleepers bounded “Chain Lightning.” To this side, to that, it"
18295,BY MARY DENSEL.,swayed madly. Phil’s grasp never slackened. On they rushed. Phil dared
18296,BY MARY DENSEL.,not roll off the sled now lest he should be killed. It seemed no less
18297,BY MARY DENSEL.,certain death to stay on.
18298,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18299,BY MARY DENSEL.,"The engine gave short panting breaths, as if it were frightened,"
18300,BY MARY DENSEL.,"itself, at the trick it was playing the boy."
18301,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18302,BY MARY DENSEL.,"A kindly tree stretched out a limb, but tried in vain to rescue Phil."
18303,BY MARY DENSEL.,The sled bounded far less now as the train whizzed along. The runners
18304,BY MARY DENSEL.,"were half an inch from the ground. Held by its strong rope, the"
18305,BY MARY DENSEL.,sharp-shooter was like a small tail to a big kite. Cinders flew--the
18306,BY MARY DENSEL.,cars flew--“Chain Lightning” flew--Phil flew. (I am telling you the
18307,BY MARY DENSEL.,truth.)
18308,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18309,BY MARY DENSEL.,It seemed to our friend as if he had been rushing through space ever
18310,BY MARY DENSEL.,since he was born. It seemed as if he had come millions of miles. Would
18311,BY MARY DENSEL.,"this awful ride never end? Phil’s fingers were numb, so tightly did"
18312,BY MARY DENSEL.,they clasp “Chain Lightning’s” edge. He saw stars before him.
18313,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18314,BY MARY DENSEL.,And now _thump! bump! bump! thump!_ “Chain Lightning” was knocking the
18315,BY MARY DENSEL.,sleepers once more. It might have occurred to Phil that he could hardly
18316,BY MARY DENSEL.,bear this sort of travelling much longer had not his brain been too
18317,BY MARY DENSEL.,dizzy to do much thinking.
18318,BY MARY DENSEL.,

18332,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18333,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Well, you are a dear,” began Kate, looking up from her crocheting. But"
18334,BY MARY DENSEL.,"before she could finish there came a loud ring at the door-bell, and"

18337,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18338,BY MARY DENSEL.,"At last, “Aren’t you dead?” he gasped."
18339,BY MARY DENSEL.,

18341,BY MARY DENSEL.,
18342,BY MARY DENSEL.,"“Well, I never!” said Fred. “I was over to the post-office when the"

18349,BY MARY DENSEL.,We will pass over any family discussion of the incident; but within

18352,BY MARY DENSEL.,and to this day some of the lads a little out of Phil’s own circle are
18353,BY MARY DENSEL.,"convinced he went to town on the cow-catcher, and other some believe"

18369,BY THE EDITOR.,Our prose writers have many winter scenes worthy of reading and
18370,BY THE EDITOR.,remembrance (notably such as are found in the writings of Charles
18371,BY THE EDITOR.,Dickens and Nathaniel Hawthorne) which might almost be called prose
18372,BY THE EDITOR.,poems; but to-day we will wander together through the flower gardens of
18373,BY THE EDITOR.,"the real poets, whose eyes were made clearer to see the beauties of the"
18374,BY THE EDITOR.,"world around them, by the loving attention they gave to common things."
18375,BY THE EDITOR.,
18376,BY THE EDITOR.,There is a rabbinical fable to the effect that Jesus was once passing
18377,BY THE EDITOR.,"along a crowded city street, and that he came to a place where lay,"
18378,BY THE EDITOR.,"unsightly, ragged and bruised, a dead dog. The disciples said, “What"
18379,BY THE EDITOR.,does this carrion here? throw it out of the Master’s way.” But the
18380,BY THE EDITOR.,"Master said, “Look what beautiful teeth--they are white as pearls!”"
18381,BY THE EDITOR.,
18382,BY THE EDITOR.,So the poet finds “nothing common or unclean” in anything that God has
18383,BY THE EDITOR.,"made, and man has not marred; and even, as in the case of the poor,"
18384,BY THE EDITOR.,"ill-used animal, finds something left to admire in the wreck and ruin"
18385,BY THE EDITOR.,"of former beauty. And though winter wrecks the beauty of the summer, it"
18386,BY THE EDITOR.,has a beauty of its own.
18387,BY THE EDITOR.,
18388,BY THE EDITOR.,For a country winter in New England there is no better description than
18389,BY THE EDITOR.,Whittier’s “Snow-Bound” and for the same season in Old England parts
18390,BY THE EDITOR.,"of Cowper’s “Winter Evening,” “Winter Morning Walk” and “Winter Walk"

18395,BY THE EDITOR.,but he is rather the poet of human life and society than of inanimate
18396,BY THE EDITOR.,nature.

18398,BY THE EDITOR.,"James Thomson, who wrote “The Seasons,” has a fine description of"
18399,BY THE EDITOR.,Winter; and every one should know by heart the first twenty lines of
18400,BY THE EDITOR.,his “Hymn on the Seasons.”
18401,BY THE EDITOR.,
18402,BY THE EDITOR.,Percy Bysshe Shelley has some beautiful lines on a winter’s night; and
18403,BY THE EDITOR.,"Tennyson has many fine lines, “The Death of the Old Year,” and parts of"
18404,BY THE EDITOR.,“In Memoriam” being the finest.
18405,BY THE EDITOR.,
18406,BY THE EDITOR.,Would it not be interesting to each one of the readers of the GRAMMAR

18420,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I have a fancy like a dream, that perhaps it has been Adélê. And yet"
18421,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I cannot say why. My father, the captain, whose daughter I am by"

18437,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“This day begins with clearing weather and light airs from S. E.
18438,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Middle part of day wind light and baffling. At 3 P. M. passed a

18445,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18446,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Such is all I know of my beginning of life. Excepting that only for
18447,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the uncommon brightness of the moon, the lookout had not seen the"
18448,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"drifting boat. It is said in all the books I have read, of the babe who"
18449,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"is discovered, that it smiles sweetly in the face of its benefactor."
18450,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,But the captain tells me often that I rent the air with crying till I
18451,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"was black in the face, until, arriving on the deck of the “Petrel,”"
18452,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"old Candace, the negress, took me in her embrace. She it was who was"
18453,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"stewardess, with her husband Jim (also of color) as cook."
18454,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18455,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"The captain would at once have had me fed with Port wines, condensed"
18456,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"milk, canned soups, and like nourishment. But Candace said “no,” and"
18457,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,gave me of food in small quantities. “Dat ’ar little stummick mus’n be
18458,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"filled to depletion,” is that which the captain repeats as her words to"
18459,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,him.
18460,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18461,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Remaining on board, she had a care of me for four years. I would not be"
18462,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,on the shore for even an hour. I cried bitterly when out of sight of my
18463,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"captain. Again we had a stewardess who was English, with her husband"
18464,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"to cook. She taught me my sewing, and a prayer to say to the good God."
18465,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,But as I became more old in years the captain gave to me my instruction
18466,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"in books. He learned me of many things useful, and it is said of me"
18467,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,that I have a marvellous power to attain in study. At my present age
18468,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I am thin--_svelte_, as old M. Jacques, the former mate, says--with a"
18469,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"complexion of brunette, and eyes and hair which are black. This it is,"
18470,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,with the readiness which I had in learning the French language of M.
18471,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Jacques, which gives me to think that my mother at least was French."
18472,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,The accent and words seemed to always be known to me as of a dream.
18473,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18474,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,But the captain will have it to say that I am a gift of Christmas from
18475,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"his wife who is with the good God. Be that as it may, I am to him as"
18476,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"his very, very own, and he to me as father and mother in one, “the"
18477,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"child of his old age,” he insists; for though straight and erect as the"
18478,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"mast of the “Petrel,” he is in age sixty years."
18479,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18480,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,He has provided for me everything of comfort and elegance that a young
18481,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,girl could wish. For the “Petrel” is a small brig which goes over all
18482,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the world where a keel may float, in order to trade. It may be to"
18483,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"purchase shells in the Indian ocean, furs in St. Petersburg, fruits"
18484,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"at Havana, spices in Ceylon, silks at Nankin, diamonds or ostrich"
18485,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"feathers at Cape Town, knick-knacks in London, or _bijouterie_ at"
18486,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Havre--anywhere and everywhere that a bargain may be made, we go. And"
18487,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"in every port the ladies of the consignee, or the American consul, will"
18488,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"have me at their homes, and are _so_ good to me. They take me to the"
18489,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,galleries of art and places of interest. I attend the service of the
18490,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"church with them, and at their homes I meet people who are delightful."
18491,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Thus I have learned to love things which are beautiful, and the captain"
18492,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,is only too willing to get for me what I desire. He has had built for
18493,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,me into the cabin a little cabinet organ. We took as passengers to
18494,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the Sandwich Islands last year, a good missionary, and his wife, who"
18495,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"accompanied him, taught me the music, and to sing and play, so that I"
18496,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,am never ennuyéed at sea. I have a great abundance of books; I have
18497,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"my music, my studies (navigation is among them), my sewing, a canary"
18498,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"bird, and a pot of ivy--beside my journal from which these pages"
18499,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,are recorded--what would you more? It does not matter that we meet
18500,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"storms--sometimes terrible ones. I do not say it to boast, but I have"
18501,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,not anything of fear within. I love to be on deck; I have the long oil
18502,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"coat which buttons close about me like that of the captain, and boots"
18503,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,of rubber. Oftentimes the captain permits that I give the orders for
18504,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"taking in the light sails, or tacking the brig. And I can steer with"
18505,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the wheel as well as old Dan himself, or trace the vessel’s course upon"
18506,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,the chart when I have figured the reckoning.

18508,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"You of the young ladies who murmur because of the space of closets,"
18509,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"should visit _my_ room. It has a length of ten feet, a breadth of six."
18510,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"My berth, with three drawers beneath it, takes much of the room. But I"
18511,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"have a tiny wash-stand, a small chair, and a trunk also."
18512,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18513,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Pictures too. The one, “Christ Stilling the Tempest,” is a small"
18514,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"painting in oil, which was a present to myself from a lady in Rome"
18515,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,whose husband is a great artist.
18516,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18517,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Opposite hangs a photograph of the “Immaculate Conception,” also a"
18518,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"present from a lady in Liverpool, Mrs. Fancher. There is fastened to"
18519,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,the wall a swinging lamp of solid silver. A diver of the submarine
18520,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"brought it up from the wreck of a steam yacht which, belonging to Omar"
18521,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Pacha, was lost with all those on board in the Persian Gulf. The man"
18522,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,gave it as pay for his passage to Foochow. But imagine to yourself the
18523,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,curtains of my berth being of silk damask worked with gold thread! They
18524,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"are of much value, yet when one asks of their price, the captain says,"
18525,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"with his laugh, that he bought them for a song. It was while we were"
18526,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,loading with a few teas at Foochow. A man habited as a sailor came on
18527,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"board at the evening, and offered this for fifty dollars. He had been"
18528,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"a runaway from a ship, and seeking the country, was impressed into the"
18529,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,army of Chinese insurgents. They had sacked the emperor’s country seat
18530,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"at Ningpo, and this was torn from the hangings of the couch of the"
18531,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,princess--or he thus said. The captain told him he could not give but
18532,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"twenty dollars, though it was of more worth. But the man said “no,” and"
18533,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"went out. It was then, thinking that he had gone, I began to sing and"
18534,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"play the song of Adelaide Proctor, “The Lost Chord,” which I so love."
18535,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,And the strange man came back and began to cry! He said to the captain
18536,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"if I would sing it once more, he should have the stuff at his own"
18537,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"price, which I did willingly, and thus it was purchased."
18538,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18539,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,My book-shelves are of sandal-wood inlaid with ebony. They were given
18540,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,me in Madras by the merchant with whom the captain has done business
18541,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,these many years. The ewer and jug in my wash-stand are of bronze. They
18542,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,were discovered from a tomb in the Island of Cyprus.
18543,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18544,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"But it is in especial of one voyage--the last--of which I have to tell,"
18545,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"for it came near to become an adventure. We were bound to Lisbon,"
18546,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"seeking a cargo of the light wines for the market of New York, and"
18547,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,the captain had with him for the purchase three thousand dollars in
18548,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"gold. He had shipped for the voyage a different chief mate, and also"
18549,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,two men of the crew who came on board with him. It happens to me to
18550,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"notice small things, and I remember that I looked with surprise at the"
18551,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,familiarity which these common sailors had secretly with the first
18552,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,mate. Old Jacques would hardly have spoken to a sailor even upon the
18553,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"land, except in the way of duty. I had for this Mr. Atkin, as he called"
18554,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"himself, a strong dislike. His face had a smooth badness, but he was"
18555,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"fluent of tongue with an appearance of education, and the captain"
18556,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,smiled at what he said was my childish prejudice. Yet the good God has
18557,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"given me to read the human face, and I often have chosen out those from"
18558,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the crew who I felt would make trouble to the officers, and was seldom"
18559,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,with mistake.
18560,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18561,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"The second officer was Waters, a man very young but brave and active."
18562,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"He too regarded this Atkin with suspicion. “Tell your father, Miss,” he"
18563,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"said to me in private, “to keep his weather eye open, and look out for"
18564,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Atkin.”
18565,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18566,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"The captain did but laugh when I told him, and bade me not trouble my"
18567,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,little head with fears. But I found him watchful in a quiet way after
18568,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"that, though there happened nothing for some time of suspicion."
18569,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18570,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,I find as I copy from my journal that I do not sometimes frame these
18571,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,sentences in the exact order that I read them in books. I cannot seem
18572,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"to readily correct myself, so I have made a point to put down all the"
18573,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"conversation which I remember, exactly as it was spoken by those of"
18574,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,whom I shall write. It will be a good practice for me. I began to keep
18575,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"my journal three years since, with view of having a better command of"
18576,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,language.
18577,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18578,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,We finally made sight of the Teneriffe peak among the Canary Islands.
18579,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"It rises many thousand feet above the sea, and for miles is visible in"
18580,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,the clear weather.
18581,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18582,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"That night the winds died away, and we were becalmed, and _so_ warm"
18583,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"as it was! I could not sleep, and in the first watch--that of the"
18584,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,captain--I went upon deck. Old Dan is a sailor who has been at sea with
18585,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"us a great many years, and the only one that the captain wishes me to"
18586,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,speak with when he is not present.
18587,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18588,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"So after I had chatted with the captain a little, he went forward a"
18589,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,moment with a command for the second mate.
18590,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18591,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“How do you head, Dan?” I asked of him idly."
18592,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18593,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Mostly all round the compass, there being no steerage way to speak of,"
18594,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Miss,” he made answer."
18595,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18596,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I yawned, for I had a strong desire to sleep, yet cared not to go to"
18597,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,the close air of below.
18598,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18599,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"All at once, I thought of the life-boat which swings at the “Petrel’s”"
18600,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"stern, covered with canvas, and how delightful to be in it were it"
18601,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,possible. If there came a breath of wind I should feel it there; and
18602,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,remembering that I had seen a torn fore-royal put into the boat a few
18603,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"days previous, I made up my mind what to do. “Look you, Dan,” I said,"
18604,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“I am going to sleep in the life-boat till you shall come to the wheel
18605,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"again in the morning watch from twelve till four, and then you can call"
18606,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,me.”
18607,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18608,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Very well, Miss,” he made reply, though he regarded me with a little"
18609,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"doubt, “only maybe Cap’n Wray wouldn’t think--”"
18610,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18611,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“He need know nothing of it,” I said with impatience, for I have a will"
18612,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"headstrong, which often causes me after-sorrow. And without other words"
18613,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I slipped myself within the boat, pulling the cover in place with care."
18614,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18615,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“Where is Miss Wray?” I heard the captain to ask as he came aft a
18616,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,moment after.
18617,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18618,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“She’s turned in, sir,” was the answer of Dan."
18619,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18620,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Then the captain began his walk of the quarter-deck with vain
18621,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,whistlings for the breeze.
18622,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18623,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,But it was charming laying upon the old sail listening to the twitter
18624,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"of Mother Cary’s chickens, and the cool swash of the sea about the"
18625,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,rudder.
18626,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18627,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"It is not a wonder, then, that I fell into fast sleep, only to awaken"
18628,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"by the bell striking “one, two, three, four,” which I knew had the"
18629,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"meaning of two o’clock of the morning, and I had some regret at my"
18630,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"foolish whim, for it had become quite cool and damp. Yet I knew I might"
18631,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"not release myself until four o’clock, when old Dan again had the wheel."
18632,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18633,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,I raised a corner of the cover and peeped out. Spanish Joe stood with
18634,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"one hand upon the wheel, looking sideways in the half darkness of the"
18635,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,night. The light from the binnacle was upon his swarthy face with
18636,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"strength, and I told myself, with a little shiver, that it was the face"
18637,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,of a brigand such as I had gazed upon in some gallery of pictures. But
18638,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"figure to yourself my feelings as Mr. Atkin, after listening a moment"
18639,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"at the open window of the state-room of the captain, came directly"
18640,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"behind the wheel, and seating himself upon the taffrail so near that I"
18641,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"could touch him, began with an absent drumming of his fingers upon the"
18642,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,cover of the boat itself!
18643,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18644,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Everybody is sound asleep but you and I, Joe,” he said in half a"
18645,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,whisper.
18646,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18647,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“_Bueno_,” was the reply of Joe; “an’ now, s’pose you say what you have"
18648,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"think ’bout us try to get dis money you tell us of, eh?”"
18649,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18650,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Well, Joe,” he answers, and you cannot imagine to yourself how like"
18651,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"oil was his voice, “I’ve laid the thing out about this way. To-morrow"
18652,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"night when Dan is steering and the Swede on the lookout, we’ll give"
18653,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"young Waters a little pleasant surprise, and when he comes to himself,"
18654,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,he’ll find that his hands are lashed and something over his mouth to
18655,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"keep him from making a noise--savey, Joe?”"
18656,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18657,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I trembled in every limb, and was with a cold perspiration on my face."
18658,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Had I been one who swoons readily I should have fainted. But at once I
18659,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"recovered myself. “Be brave, Bessie,” I repeated to my heart: “it is"
18660,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,for the dear captain’s sake.”
18661,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18662,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Then we’ll get the captain out,” the wretch continued, as Spanish Joe"
18663,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"made a small nod of the head, “and serve him so, and if the cook, or"
18664,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Dan, or the Swede make a fuss (which they won’t dare do) they’ll see"
18665,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"that the balance of power is with us, for we’ve got pistols, and they"
18666,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"haven’t. Eh, Joe?”"
18667,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18668,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“Then w’at?” asked Joe with much of eagerness.
18669,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18670,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Why, then,” Mr. Atkin goes on with the ease that he would remark upon"
18671,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"the weather, “we’ll put the long boat over the side, and politely"
18672,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"invite Captain Wray, Miss Wray, Mr. Waters and the cook or one of the"
18673,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"men to step in. They can shape their course for the Azores, only thirty"
18674,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"miles away, Joe, and we’ll shape ours for Europe.”"
18675,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18676,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“But will you?” I thought within myself with my teeth clenched.

18697,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Ah, how slowly passed the time! but finally, Joe, with yawns, struck"

18700,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Surely I lost no time in coming from my hiding-place, and I sought the"
18701,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"captain, who, without removing his clothing, had reclined himself upon"
18702,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,a lounge in the cabin. I revealed to him in whispers that which I had
18703,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,heard.
18704,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18705,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“My brave little girl!” he said, as I had made an end of my story; but"
18706,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I could not think what there was of bravery in laying _perdu_, and"
18707,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"listening to conspirators. Had I not given him counsel, though, I think"
18708,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"he would have been for dashing upon the three who thus conspired, and"
18709,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,smiting them hip and thigh. But I told him to communicate in secret
18710,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"with Mr. Waters, and they two together might make plans of strategy"
18711,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,which would avail without bloodshed; and he did so.
18712,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18713,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,It was unfortunate that the captain was entirely without firearms of
18714,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,any kind. I think I myself would have dared to use one in such an
18715,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,emergency. But he whispered to me in the morning that he had that which
18716,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,should serve the same end; and with a beating heart I awaited the
18717,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,result.
18718,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18719,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,The calm remained into the forenoon of the next day. The sea was like
18720,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"oily glass, without a ripple as far as one could view, and the sun"
18721,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"made itself hardly to be endured, so fierce did it beat down upon the"
18722,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"scorched deck, in the seams of which the pitch fairly melted. The sails"
18723,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"hung without motion against the mast, and the wheel was idle."
18724,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18725,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"With a heart fast beating I followed the captain, who had told me to be"
18726,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"without fear, upon the deck."
18727,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18728,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“I wish we had a couple of the turtle that are laying round so plenty,"
18729,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"asleep on the water, this morning,” said the captain, as if to myself,"
18730,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"who, stood by him, though in a careless way."
18731,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18732,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"I had no meaning of his words, but Atkin, who was near, looked at the"

18734,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18735,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Yes, sir,” he made reply, “there’s always lots of them about the"
18736,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Azores in calm weather--nice soup they make, too.”"
18737,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18738,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“You might take the longboat, if you like, Mr. Atkin,” said the captain"
18739,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"with a yawn, as if it had but then occurred to him, “and with your"
18740,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,watch take two or three--it would be a change from salt beef.”
18741,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18742,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Very well, sir,” Atkin replies; for this man was a lover of nice"
18743,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"food--a _gourmand_. “Here, you Joe and Jerry, get the boat over the"
18744,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,side.”
18745,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18746,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,[Illustration: THE TABLES ARE SUDDENLY TURNED ON THE CONSPIRATORS.]
18747,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18748,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,I began to guess that there was a purpose in this. I saw that the
18749,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"captain had, under a mask of carelessness, a face of anxiety, and"
18750,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"that the hand that held his glasses with which he viewed the horizon,"
18751,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,trembled never so little as he paced backward and forward while the two
18752,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"men were putting over the boat. When all was ready, Mr. Atkin in the"
18753,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,stern-sheets pushed off from the vessel’s side.
18754,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18755,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Stop a bit!” now called the captain, as I watched with strong anxiety"
18756,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,his face. There was a stern ring in his voice which I had seldom heard.
18757,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"And at the same time I saw Mr. Waters, Dan and the Swede come from the"
18758,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,cook’s galley with buckets of hot water which they brought to the rail.
18759,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18760,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,“Well?” asked Atkin with inquiry. And he motioned the two men to cease
18761,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,from rowing.
18762,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18763,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“You see Teneriffe peak, do you?” again spoke the captain."
18764,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18765,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Why, yes, sir,” was the answer of Atkin: “what then?”"
18766,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18767,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"“Just this,” said the captain; “my advice to you, you scoundrels, is"
18768,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,that you pull your prettiest for the Azore Islands; for while my name
18769,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,is Wray not one of you ever shall set foot again of this brig’s deck!”
18770,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18771,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Ah, then what oaths! what cries of rage! And so desperate was this"
18772,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"villain Atkin that he drew a pistol and commanded his men to pull back,"
18773,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,which they did with hesitation. But they were scarce within reach when
18774,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,old Dan discharged the contents of his hot-water bucket full at them.
18775,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,I clapped my hands. I could not resist. For Atkin caught enough of it
18776,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,on his neck and shoulder to cause him to fall backward over the thwart
18777,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"with a roar, and by accident, discharge his pistol in the air."
18778,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18779,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"Then it was they saw they were entrapped, and pulled hastily away to a"
18780,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"distance, where they laid upon their oars with angry words each to the"
18781,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,other.
18782,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18783,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"And oh, how with eagerness we watched for a breeze, which came not"
18784,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,until in the late afternoon. But when once more the ripple of the water
18785,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"made around the bows, and the sails swelled out with a wind from the"
18786,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"southwest, I breathed with freeness, and we all thanked the good God as"
18787,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,we watched the boat of the conspirators to disappear in the distance.
18788,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18789,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"There were left on board the captain, second mate, two men, the cook"
18790,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"and stewardess. And Captain Wray said I should be his second mate, Mr."
18791,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Waters acting as chief officer.
18792,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18793,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,Many times I stood at the wheel for three and four hours before we
18794,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"reached Lisbon. But the “Petrel,” which has but a tonnage of one"
18795,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"hundred and sixty, was easily handled, and the good God gave us"
18796,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"favoring winds, as also fair weather; so with much fatigue, but"
18797,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"otherwise well, we finally reached our port in safety."
18798,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18799,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,The captain sometimes speaks as one who is getting too old for the life
18800,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,of the ocean--in particular of late does he say this. And he has made
18801,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"hints at a home upon the land, with a house which shall look far out"
18802,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"over the sea, and be ever within the sound of its voice. It may be that"
18803,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"after a time, and with him, I should be content thus to live. But as"
18804,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"now, I regard it with dread. I had somehow dreamed of a continuation"
18805,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"of this life which so delights me, and some day to be buried under the"
18806,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,blue waves. But we shall see.
18807,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18808,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,
18809,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,The foregoing story is entirely true in all its essential features. I
18810,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"was somewhat acquainted with Miss Wray, and it was with sorrow that in"

18812,BY FRANK H. CONVERSE.,"was lost in the English Channel, with all on board, in a December gale."

18922,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“O, what can this mean?” asked its many tiny blades, _this_ time in a"

18930,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“Farewell,” called the dandelions; “farewell,” murmured the brook; and"

18936,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"There was here no sign of anything green, but the brown earth had been"

18962,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"“It makes the place look pleasant at once,” said the man, leaning"

18965,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"as--well, as green as grass, for I don’t know anything greener,” he"
18966,BY MARGARET EYTINGE.,"added, laughing. “And I say, Jenny, what a splendid place it’ll be for"

19002,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"If “Restwood,” the little country-house to which we fly from the heat,"
19003,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and dust, and toil of the great city, were only large enough, we would"
19004,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,invite all the young “Wide Awakes” to gather there. We would show them
19005,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"such scenery; we would wander with them through the deep pine-forest,"
19006,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"whose whisperings are mingled with the wild roar of the dashing sea,"
19007,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and take them to sail in our fairy-like boat, over a bay that cannot be"
19008,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,outshone by even the lovely Italian waters.
19009,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19010,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"Near us are rich country squires, in great, square, white houses, where"
19011,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"their fathers lived and died; farmers, who fight manfully against what"
19012,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"inlanders call sterility, making fruitful the very sands by their"
19013,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"energy; and a few retired city gentlemen, who fish, and sail, and hunt,"
19014,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and read, and ride, and eat, and sleep."
19015,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19016,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"But the greatest among all these, a few years ago,--he may prove in the"
19017,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"coming day one of the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,--was a tall,"
19018,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"frail young man, whom his neighbors regarded as deficient in intellect."
19019,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"Everybody is weak in some direction. A wise man has remarked, that"
19020,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"no one since the fall, when all humanity lost its balance, has been"
19021,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"perfectly sane. It is sometimes very hard to tell who, taking all"
19022,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"things into account, are the “weaker;” but there is little doubt that a"
19023,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,jury of wise men would have counted our friend Jotham Belden among them.
19024,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19025,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"What little balance-wheel was missing in that mind, He who made it"
19026,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"only knows; but we rejoice that, while He withheld some powers common"
19027,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"to most men, He also bestowed on him what He withholds from many--a"
19028,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"powerful memory, and a delicately refined taste, and a strong sense of"
19029,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,right.
19030,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19031,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Jotham was no pauper weakling. He was the cherished son of an honorable
19032,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"widow, who had ample means to gratify all his innocent desires; who"
19033,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"speaks of him now with a sigh as well as a smile, and tells how he was"
19034,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"the fairest and brightest of her fold, till the blight fell on him,"
19035,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and he rose from his sick bed shattered in body, and with a cloud over"
19036,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"his mind. “He was never again the same Joe, whose bright speeches and"
19037,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"merry pranks had been the pride of the farm-house, and the amusement of"
19038,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"the village,” she tells you."
19039,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19040,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,The Scotch have this beautiful saying: “The feckless (witless) are
19041,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"God’s peculiar care.” And it seemed as if this blighted one, Joe"
19042,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"Belden, were, indeed, His peculiar favorite; as if, in the furnace of"
19043,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"pain, with his worldly wisdom had also been consumed all of meanness,"
19044,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and selfishness, and hardness."
19045,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19046,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Jotham grew up very watchful of the interests of all about him. No
19047,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,fellow-being was too low or too sinful to claim his pity; no creature
19048,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"of God too mean to share his love and protection. Being weak in body,"
19049,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"he had never toiled for his bread. When in the house, he read, in"
19050,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"stammering accents, to his mother, held the yarn while she wound it,"
19051,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and performed any little task she required. This all done, he would"
19052,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"stroll out, as he said, to see that all was right in town. He would go"
19053,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"to a house where there was sickness, look anxiously up at the windows,"
19054,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"and hang patiently round the gate till spoken to. Then he would ask,"
19055,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“Want anybody to go for the doctor? Want any jelly? Want burdocks, or"
19056,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"horseradish, or anything?”"
19057,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19058,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"If sent for the doctor, or allowed to dig herbs for the sufferer, he"
19059,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"was the happiest man in town; if nothing was wanted there, he would"
19060,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"wander off to the lonely poor-house--a long, red building, in a barren"
19061,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"waste, looking as if erected to teach men and women that they had no"
19062,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"business to be old and poor, and that they must be punished for it."
19063,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Here his were like angels’ visits in the joy they brought. His pockets
19064,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"were an unfathomable depth; heavy with jack-knives, gimlets, screws,"
19065,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"nails, buttons, keys, chalk, cinnamon, cloves, and lozenges, and the"
19066,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,thousand innumerable trifles which become treasures in such a blank as
19067,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,this poor-house was.
19068,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19069,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Jotham’s coming made more commotion than a peddler’s; for although he
19070,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"brought far less stores, either in quantity or quality, they could get"
19071,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"his as they could not the other’s, for want of money. Newspapers,"
19072,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"tracts, and, occasionally, a book, were among his gifts; and perhaps He"
19073,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"who seeth not as man seeth, regarded and blessed these weak efforts as"
19074,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,He does not always the gold and the silver which rich men cast into the

19077,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"One spring day, after an unusually severe winter, Jotham presented"
19078,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"himself before his mother in a blue farm-frock, with his pants tucked"
19079,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,into a pair of two capacious cowhide boots.

19083,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“Yes, Hans has plowed the three-cornered field for me, and I’m going to"

19085,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19086,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“But that’s poor soil, dear boy, and it’s far from the house. There are"

19089,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19090,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“They’ll gather the crops themselves, mother; they don’t need any"
19091,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"sickle, nor any one to teach them. God teaches them how to get in their"
19092,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"harvest,” was Jotham’s reply."
19093,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19094,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“Whom are you talking about, Jotham,” asked his mother, in surprise."
19095,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19096,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“Of God’s birds, mother. The men said at the store last night, that"
19097,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,lots of birds died round there in the fall and spring--starved to
19098,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"death, and all the grain is God’s. I’m going to sow a field on purpose"
19099,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"for them, and nobody shall reap it but them. I love them because God"
19100,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,loves them. I’ll feed them as he feeds me.”
19101,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19102,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Tears filled her eyes as she laid her hand tenderly on the brown head
19103,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,of her smitten son. Was she not happier than many a mother whose bright
19104,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,boy has wandered far from innocence and truthfulness?
19105,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19106,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"One day, not long after this, Jotham’s minister saw him walking over"
19107,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"the fields in a strange, circuitous manner, describing curves and"
19108,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"angles like a drunken man. Waiting till he came up to the road, the"
19109,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"gentleman asked, “What makes you walk in that way, Jotham?”"
19110,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19111,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“For fear I’ll step on the ant-hills, sir. There never were so many"
19112,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"ants before, sir; the fields and the roads are full of their little"
19113,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,houses. They built them grain by grain; and what would God think of me
19114,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"if I trod on them just for carelessness,--as if a giant should tear our"
19115,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"house down to amuse himself, or because he didn’t care! You know, sir,”"
19116,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"he added, in a whisper, looking reverently up to the skies, “He hadn’t"
19117,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"any home down here, though the foxes and the birds had; and He’s very"
19118,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"careful of all homes now,--homes are such beautiful things, sir.”"
19119,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19120,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“God bless you, dear boy,” said the minister. “It was for Christ’s sake"
19121,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"you cast seed broadcast over that rocky field, for His sake that you"
19122,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,turned your foot away from the home of the poor ant; and for this love
19123,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,He will never leave you hungry or homeless.”
19124,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,

19127,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,“God’s birds” gathered one harvest under the eye of their grateful
19128,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"patron, and then he was called away from his simple work."
19129,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19130,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"His step had long been growing weaker, and the hectic burning more"
19131,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"brightly in his cheek, when, one evening, as he lay on the lounge"
19132,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"beside his mother, in light slumber, he called her, and said, “Did you"
19133,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"hear that, mother?”"
19134,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19135,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"“No, Jotham. What do you hear?”"

19138,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"the other creatures I have loved, are enjoying themselves in the"
19139,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"sunshine. The black ants have all turned to gold, and all the other"
19140,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"creatures that men hate. I hear a voice, mother--hark! ‘Ye are of more"
19141,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,value than many sparrows. Go to the ant; consider her ways.’ I never
19142,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"hurt anything God made--did I, mother?”"

19149,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19150,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,“Have I?” he asked; and it is no matter whether his vision was what we
19151,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"call “dreaming,” or not; he had dealt lovingly with the weak things"
19152,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"of God, and was now receiving His approval, as “faithful over a few"
19153,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,things.”
19154,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,
19155,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Before day dawned Jotham’s weak powers were expanding in the warmth of
19156,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"God’s love, and he is now, for aught we know, one of the greatest in"

19159,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,Many summers have brought birds and flowers since then; but if you
19160,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"should pass Willow Brook Farm to-day, you would see a wild-looking crop"
19161,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"of grain growing rank and free in a three-cornered field, off to the"
19162,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,east of the house. Perhaps you would also see an aged woman standing in
19163,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"the door-way, shading her eyes with her hand, as she looks off on this"
19164,BY MRS. J. D. CHAPLIN.,"little memorial crop which she has caused to be planted every year, for"

19173,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19174,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19175,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,Every one thinks of China when birds’-nest soup is mentioned--it seems
19176,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"so naturally to belong with stewed snails, fricasseed rats, and other"
19177,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,delicacies of that sort; and the Chinese are very large consumers of
19178,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"this strange dish, but they are not the only ones."
19179,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19180,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"The nests from which the soup is made are found in Borneo, Java, and"
19181,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"other warm regions, and are the dwelling-houses of the edible or"
19182,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"esculent swallow. They are not made, like other nests, of moss, leaves,"
19183,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"and twigs, as not much soup could be extracted from such things, but"
19184,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"the substance is like gelatine, and is thought to proceed from the"
19185,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"body of the bird--just as the web does from that of the spider, or the"
19186,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,cocoon from the silk-worm.
19187,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19188,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"When the swallows’ houses are new and fresh they are snowy white, and"
19189,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"so delicate and pretty, that they look quite good enough to eat. This"
19190,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"is the kind that the Chinese are extravagantly fond of, and they pay"
19191,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"enormous prices for them. But the sun and wind soon darken them, and a"
19192,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,family of swallows at housekeeping do not keep them in very nice order;
19193,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"so that, before they are fit for soup, they have to be cleaned and"
19194,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,bleached.
19195,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19196,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"The airy swallows, who do not think anything of precipices, and never"
19197,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"trouble their heads about the soup business, build their nests in"
19198,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"such dangerous caves, often hanging directly over the sea, that the"
19199,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,people who gather them do it at the risk of their lives; and this makes
19200,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,birds’-nest soup a very expensive dish. The nests are very clear and
19201,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"beautiful, and so transparent that, when held to the light, pictures"
19202,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,placed on the other side can be seen through them. Some of them are
19203,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"shaped like clam and oyster shells, and much thicker at the end that is"
19204,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,fastened to the rock.
19205,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19206,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,The outside is in layers; but the inside shows the glutinous threads of
19207,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"which they are made, and which exposure to the air has made as hard as"
19208,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"isinglass. These nests are so shallow, that they do not seem capable of"
19209,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"holding either birds or eggs, one of them measuring only two inches in"
19210,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"length, one and three quarters in breadth, and half an inch in depth."
19211,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"It is said, however, that the building of one nest will keep a pair of"
19212,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"swallows hard at work for two months; it is well, therefore, that the"
19213,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,little laborers do not know that they are not building houses but soup.
19214,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19215,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,There are four different kinds of swallows that make these gelatinous
19216,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,nests; and the opening to the cave where they are built is always taken
19217,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"possession of by a swallow that mixes moss with the gelatine, and tries"
19218,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,to drive the soup swallow away. But they fight sturdily for their
19219,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"beloved caves, and even attempt to knock down the mixed nests with"
19220,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,stones.
19221,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19222,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"The people of Borneo, where these nests are found in the greatest"
19223,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"quantities, have many singular stories about their origin; and perhaps"
19224,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,the most interesting of these is the account of the hungry little boy
19225,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,to whom no one would give anything to eat.
19226,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19227,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,This little boy was taken by his father from one Dyak village to
19228,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"another, called Si-Lébor; and as the journey was long, they arrived"
19229,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"tired and hungry. It was a large village, with plenty of Dyaks in it;"
19230,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"and the chief of the tribe brought refreshments for the father, but"
19231,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,gave the poor child nothing. The dishes must have been served in hotel
19232,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"fashion, just enough for one; for it did not take the poor little"
19233,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,traveler long to see that he was to go hungry. The narrative says that
19234,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"“he felt much hurt;” which he undoubtedly did, and began to cry."
19235,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19236,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"Instead, however, of appealing to his selfish father for a share of the"
19237,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"viands, he made quite a little speech to the chief and his followers:--"
19238,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19239,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"“To my father,” said he, “you have given food, the _prīok_ of rice is"
19240,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"before him, the fatted pig has been killed--everything you have given"
19241,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,him. Why do you give me nothing?”
19242,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19243,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"But people who keep their enemies’ heads in their houses, in ornamental"
19244,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"rows, as these Dyaks did, cannot be very tender-hearted; and the"
19245,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,moanings of a hungry little boy were nothing more to _them_ than the
19246,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,buzzing of a fly. The child cried and cried; but his father placidly
19247,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,pursued his way through the rice and the pig; while the others probably
19248,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"continued their conversation, or stared stolidly at nothing in"
19249,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,particular.
19250,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19251,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"After a while the poor little neglected boy became quiet, and seemed to"
19252,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,have forgotten about being hungry. He even amused himself with a dog
19253,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"and a cat, which he placed together on a mat round which all the people"
19254,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"were seated in Dyak fashion. The cat and the dog, guided by the boy,"
19255,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"cut up such queer antics, that every one burst out laughing."
19256,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19257,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,But a spell was working against them for their cruelty. The boy was
19258,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"protected by the evil spirits; and soon the sky grew black, and fearful"
19259,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,gusts of wind rushed over the place. Then came such awful peals of
19260,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"thunder and lurid flashes of lightning, while the ground beneath them"
19261,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"shook and rumbled, that the whole universe seemed breaking up."
19262,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19263,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,The darkness was frightful; and the dazzling flashes of lightning only
19264,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"showed the fearful changes that were taking place. The village, with"
19265,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"its houses, melted away; and, with the inhabitants, were changed into"
19266,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"masses of stone. Not one was left alive, except the boy; and it must"
19267,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,have been a long time before he got anything to eat.
19268,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19269,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"He went back to his native village, and lived to be respected as the"
19270,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,chief of his tribe; it is not probable that any one ever neglected him
19271,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"again in the matter of rice and fatted pigs. Indeed, one would suppose,"
19272,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"after that lesson, a constant guard of watchers would be kept on a"
19273,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,sharp lookout for hungry little boys.
19274,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19275,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,But to come to the birds’ nests. Many years after this particular
19276,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"little boy had died an old and honored chief, a young chief, who was"
19277,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"his lineal descendant, had a remarkable dream. In this dream, he"
19278,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,was told that he and his tribe would find great riches if they went
19279,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"to Si-Lébor, the petrified village. They started the next day; and,"
19280,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"searching carefully about among the rocks, they came to an extensive"
19281,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"cave. They entered it with lighted torches, and found it full of the"
19282,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,famous edible birds’ nests.
19283,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19284,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"“Ah!” said they, delighted, “this is our portion, instead of that which"
19285,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"was denied to our ancestor; his due was refused then, it has now been"
19286,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,given to us his descendants; this is our ‘_balas_’ (revenge).”
19287,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,
19288,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,The birds’ nests were brought out of the cave by thousands; and thus
19289,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,they found their treasure. These Si-Lébor caves are still considered
19290,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"the richest; and the tribes who own them, the descendants of the hungry"
19291,BY ELLA RODMAN CHURCH.,"little boy, are the most prosperous and respected in all the region"

19307,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"When little Dimple Dumpling, one chill fall evening,"
19308,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Was tucked up, all in white, within his downy bed,"
19309,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"His mamma quite forgot to come and kiss him,"
19310,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And in the morning, too, forgot to come, ’tis said:--"
19311,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Of course ’tis strange that two forgotten kisses
19312,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Should make such mischief in the house in just one night;
19313,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But when Boy Dumpling woke up in the morning,"
19314,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"His lips, they say, had lost their sweet, his eyes their bright,"
19315,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And he, who’d always been a darling,"
19316,BY KITTY CLOVER.,He fell at once with nurse to quarreling.
19317,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19318,BY KITTY CLOVER.,[Illustration]
19319,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19320,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"He would not wear his scarlet frock,"
19321,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Although the morn was chill and frosty;
19322,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And off he kicked his sky-blue sock,"
19323,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Till nurse called him “Mister Crosstie,”"
19324,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And, all at once, giving a dreadful groan,"
19325,BY KITTY CLOVER.,She left cross Dimple Dumpling all alone.
19326,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19327,BY KITTY CLOVER.,But when the sounds of silver spoons and bowls
19328,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Came up and jingled round in Dimple’s chamber,"
19329,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And in stole savory sniffs of steaks and rolls,"
19330,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Quick from his chair did Dimple clamber;
19331,BY KITTY CLOVER.,And as he knew that little leggies bare
19332,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Were not received at mamma’s breakfast table,"
19333,BY KITTY CLOVER.,He thought he’d better oil and ’fume his hair
19334,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And button on his frock himself if able,--"
19335,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"The scarlet frock,--"
19336,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"The sky-blue sock,--"
19337,BY KITTY CLOVER.,He was in it
19338,BY KITTY CLOVER.,In a minute!
19339,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19340,BY KITTY CLOVER.,[Illustration]
19341,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19342,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But down stairs Dimple hourly grew more cross,"
19343,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And o’er the house with awful noise went rushing,"
19344,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Till all his folks stood up, quite at a loss"
19345,BY KITTY CLOVER.,To hit upon some brand-new means of hushing.
19346,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But on his friends the ogre frowned,"
19347,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And in the desks and drawers went prowling,"
19348,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Until a fierce jack-knife was found
19349,BY KITTY CLOVER.,That just exactly matched his scowling.--
19350,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Then Dimple opened every blade,"
19351,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And went right at his dearest treasures,"
19352,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And hacked, till every toy was made"
19353,BY KITTY CLOVER.,The victim of his savage measures.
19354,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19355,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Next Dimple growled aloud he’d “keep a school;”
19356,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"So up hopped Minnie, merry as a linnet,"
19357,BY KITTY CLOVER.,And offered picture-book and painted rule--
19358,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But “no,” he shrieked, “he wouldn’t have her in it!”"
19359,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"He seized her wooden dolls that couldn’t smile.--for O,"
19360,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"O, _how_ he hated smiles, grim Dimple Dumpling!"
19361,BY KITTY CLOVER.,And all the time they sat there in that wooden row
19362,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"His yellow head against the wall was crumpling,--"
19363,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"It must have been so sore,--but there he sat, like stone,"
19364,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And kicked the floor till mamma cried, “O, this is"
19365,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"_Very_ bad!”--but, ah, if mamma’d only known"
19366,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Her little boy was bad for lack of kisses!
19367,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19368,BY KITTY CLOVER.,[Illustration]
19369,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19370,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Well, all at once, the silver sun shone out,"
19371,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And Minnie played she’d never heard those speeches,"
19372,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But led cross Dimple out, with skip and shout,"
19373,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Down where the wind had blown the rareripe peaches.
19374,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Just one single Red-Cheek lay on the grass,"
19375,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And O, how Dimple pushed and rushed to get it,"
19376,BY KITTY CLOVER.,Though Minnie stepped aside to let him pass;
19377,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And, then, away he ran to stand and eat it.--"
19378,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"O, Dimple Dumpling! O, such a bad little man,"
19379,BY KITTY CLOVER.,All for two kisses! I wonder if this can
19380,BY KITTY CLOVER.,The reason be that so many a little brother
19381,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Goes wrong his life long,--for lack of kisses and mother!"

19385,BY KITTY CLOVER.,How do I know but a terrible hunger

19389,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Than you, Boy Dumpling, make the streets sorrowful places,"
19390,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And the angels weep at the look on the wee, wee faces?"
19391,BY KITTY CLOVER.,
19392,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"But off ran selfish Dimple through the pink peach trees,--"
19393,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"“I’s goin’ by myse’f into the meadow,”"
19394,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"He screamed,--instead, he fell upon his chubby knees"
19395,BY KITTY CLOVER.,And tumbled over in the brambly shadow.
19396,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Then loud did Dimple shriek, “Minnie! hornets and bees!”"
19397,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"He rolled, he struck before, and struck behind him,"
19398,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"While little Minnie flew along the pink peach trees,--"

19405,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"And there they clung upon his hair so soft and yellow,--"
19406,BY KITTY CLOVER.,No wonder that the tender little sister shrieks!
19407,BY KITTY CLOVER.,And when they heard her not a hornet missed her;
19408,BY KITTY CLOVER.,They stung her blind just ’cause she was his sister!--
19409,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"Poor little sister, poor little brother,"
19410,BY KITTY CLOVER.,"One ran one way, and one the other!"
