39,AGAINST LYING.,O 'tis a lovely thing for youth
40,AGAINST LYING.,To walk betimes in wisdom's way;
41,AGAINST LYING.,"To fear a lie, to speak the truth,"
42,AGAINST LYING.,That we may trust to all they say!
43,AGAINST LYING.,
44,AGAINST LYING.,"But liars we can never trust,"
45,AGAINST LYING.,Though they should speak the thing that's true;
46,AGAINST LYING.,"And he that does one fault at first,"
47,AGAINST LYING.,"And lies to hide it, makes it two."
48,AGAINST LYING.,
49,AGAINST LYING.,"Have we not known, nor heard nor read"
50,AGAINST LYING.,How God abhors deceit and wrong?

58,AGAINST LYING.,
59,AGAINST LYING.,The Lord delights in them that speak
60,AGAINST LYING.,The words of truth; but every liar
61,AGAINST LYING.,Must have his portion in the lake
62,AGAINST LYING.,That burns with brimstone and with fire.
63,AGAINST LYING.,
64,AGAINST LYING.,"Then let me always watch my lips,"
65,AGAINST LYING.,"Lest I be struck to death and hell,"
66,AGAINST LYING.,Since God a book of reckoning keeps
67,AGAINST LYING.,For every lie that children tell.

96,LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS.,
97,LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS.,"The wise will let their anger cool,"
