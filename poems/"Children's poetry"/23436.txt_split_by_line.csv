32,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
33,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
34,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
35,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Aladdin poor the wizard found,"
36,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Who moved from cavern's mouth a stone;
37,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Then bade him go beneath the ground,"
38,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"And pace through unknown realms alone,"
39,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Till from a niche he bore away
40,WONDERFUL LAMP.,A lamp--extinguishing its ray.
41,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
42,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
43,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
44,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The youth obedient instant hied,"
45,WONDERFUL LAMP.,When fruits luxuriant met his sight;
46,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The white were pearls in snowy pride,"
47,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Diamonds the clear--of brilliant light;
48,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"For red the rubies dazzling blazed,"
49,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Whereof Aladdin gathered store;
50,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Then on the lamp in rapture gazed,"
51,WONDERFUL LAMP.,And from its niche the treasure bore.
52,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
53,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
54,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
55,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Regained his home, he seized anon"
56,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The lamp, and cried ""straight bring me food;"""
57,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The Genii instantly was gone,"
58,WONDERFUL LAMP.,But soon again before him stood.
59,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The youth his fear-struck mother bore,"
60,WONDERFUL LAMP.,As plates of silver met his view;
61,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Of viands choice, containing store,"
62,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"And cups, with wine of rosy hue."
63,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
64,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
65,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
66,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Aladdin next by chance descried,"
67,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The Sultan's daughter, witching fair;"
68,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Love's high control was not denied--
69,WONDERFUL LAMP.,He sought to gain the beauty rare.
70,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Before the Sultan lowly bent
71,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"His mother, and the jewels spread;"
72,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The Prince, astonished, gave consent,"
73,WONDERFUL LAMP.,And all Aladdin's terrors fled.
74,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
75,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
76,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
77,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"In gorgeous robes the youth arrayed,"
78,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Vaulted anon his prancing steed;
79,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"And of the glittering, gay parade,"
80,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Right joyous smiling took the lead.
81,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"With loud huzzas then rang the air,"
82,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Which louder pealed, as gold amain"
83,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"By slaves was cast, for mob to share,"
84,WONDERFUL LAMP.,That glittered on the vasty plain
85,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
86,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
87,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
88,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Ne'er dreaming lamp so worn and old
89,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"More worth commanded than Peru,"
90,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Our Princess bartered wealth untold,"
91,WONDERFUL LAMP.,For the Magician's lamp quite new:
92,WONDERFUL LAMP.,So when this change the eunuch made
93,WONDERFUL LAMP.,In scorn the rabble 'gan to shout;
94,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Beholding such a silly trade,"
95,WONDERFUL LAMP.,They deemed the wizard fool and lout.
96,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
97,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
98,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
99,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"O'erwhelmed with grief, Aladdin prayed"
100,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Once more the Genii life would spare;
101,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Beseeching he might be conveyed
102,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Where late had stood his palace fair.
103,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Then swift as thought, the spirit bore"
104,WONDERFUL LAMP.,The youth through airy realms above;
105,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Who lighted safe on Afric's shore,"
106,WONDERFUL LAMP.,And gained the chamber of his love
107,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
108,WONDERFUL LAMP.,[Illustration]
109,WONDERFUL LAMP.,
110,WONDERFUL LAMP.,His foe the poison quaffed and fell--
111,WONDERFUL LAMP.,A writhing form the wizard lay;
112,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Aladdin knew how worked the spell,"
113,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"And tore from vest the lamps, his prey."
114,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"The Princess with a panting heart,"
115,WONDERFUL LAMP.,Flew to receive affection's kiss:
116,WONDERFUL LAMP.,"Thus met they, never more to part;"
117,WONDERFUL LAMP.,From that hour sealed their lasting bliss
