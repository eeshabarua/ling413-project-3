49,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
50,PREFACE.,
51,PREFACE.,The following Tale is principally taken from the admirable Work of
52,PREFACE.,"Madame de Beaumont (_Le Magazin des Enfans_), which formed almost the"
53,PREFACE.,"whole library and the delight of the children of the last generation,"
54,PREFACE.,and has hardly been surpassed by the many excellent productions which
55,PREFACE.,supply the nurseries and school-rooms of the present.
56,PREFACE.,
57,PREFACE.,The story is there told with the simplicity and sprightliness of which
58,PREFACE.,"the French language is so peculiarly capable, but which a literal"
59,PREFACE.,translation would render not only insipid but vulgar.
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,In a poetical dress it may possibly give to the young reader a part of
62,PREFACE.,"that amusement, which it once afforded the infancy of the author."

67,THE THREE WISHES.,THE THREE WISHES.
68,THE THREE WISHES.,
69,THE THREE WISHES.,
70,THE THREE WISHES.,"The sun withdrew his last pale ray,"
71,THE THREE WISHES.,And clos'd the short and chearless day;
72,THE THREE WISHES.,"Loud blew the wind, and rain and sleet"
73,THE THREE WISHES.,Against the cottage casement beat.
74,THE THREE WISHES.,
75,THE THREE WISHES.,"The busy housewife trimm'd her fire,"
76,THE THREE WISHES.,"And drew the oaken settle nigher,"
77,THE THREE WISHES.,And welcom'd home her own good man
78,THE THREE WISHES.,"To his clean hearth, his pipe, and can;"
79,THE THREE WISHES.,For Homespun and his bustling wife
80,THE THREE WISHES.,"Were honest folks in humble life,"
81,THE THREE WISHES.,"Who liv'd contented with their lot,"
82,THE THREE WISHES.,And lov'd the comforts of their cot.
83,THE THREE WISHES.,"With willing hand and chearful heart,"
84,THE THREE WISHES.,"Each of life's burden bore their part,"
85,THE THREE WISHES.,"With patience all its ills withstood,"
86,THE THREE WISHES.,And thankfully receiv'd the good.
87,THE THREE WISHES.,
88,THE THREE WISHES.,"Yet, they were not without their failings:"
89,THE THREE WISHES.,They lov'd the harvest-home regalings;
90,THE THREE WISHES.,On summer evenings on the green
91,THE THREE WISHES.,At cricket oft was Homespun seen;
92,THE THREE WISHES.,"And sometimes, where the sign ensnares"
93,THE THREE WISHES.,"The wearied swain to drown his cares,"
94,THE THREE WISHES.,"He lov'd to quaff the foaming ale,"
95,THE THREE WISHES.,And listen to a merry tale.
96,THE THREE WISHES.,Was there within ten miles a fair--
97,THE THREE WISHES.,He and his dame were surely there:
98,THE THREE WISHES.,"For she too lov'd, in trim array,"
99,THE THREE WISHES.,"And scarlet cloak, a holiday."
100,THE THREE WISHES.,Ah! then within her pocket burn'd
101,THE THREE WISHES.,"The long sav'd crown so hardly earn'd,"
102,THE THREE WISHES.,While in the stall temptation spread
103,THE THREE WISHES.,The printed gown or top-knot red;
104,THE THREE WISHES.,Nor did her little happy train
105,THE THREE WISHES.,For drum or whistle sue in vain.
106,THE THREE WISHES.,
107,THE THREE WISHES.,"Will Rigour's brow relentless lour,"
108,THE THREE WISHES.,If pleasure steal from toil _one_ hour?
109,THE THREE WISHES.,And shall the poor enjoy no ray
110,THE THREE WISHES.,Of sunshine through their winter's day?
111,THE THREE WISHES.,"Nor pluck the few wild flowers, that bloom"
112,THE THREE WISHES.,'Midst poverty's ungenial gloom?
113,THE THREE WISHES.,
114,THE THREE WISHES.,"Now, seated in his wicker chair,"
115,THE THREE WISHES.,The swain enjoys his homely fare:
116,THE THREE WISHES.,"His rosy children round him press,"
117,THE THREE WISHES.,Eager to share the fond caress;
118,THE THREE WISHES.,And as his eyes delighted trace
119,THE THREE WISHES.,"Health and content in each dear face,"
120,THE THREE WISHES.,"He scarce desires a happier lot,"
121,THE THREE WISHES.,"His toils unfelt, his cares forgot."
122,THE THREE WISHES.,
123,THE THREE WISHES.,"When supper ended,--grace was said,"
124,THE THREE WISHES.,"The babes were bless'd, and sent to bed,"
125,THE THREE WISHES.,"And o'er the fire the parents sat,"
126,THE THREE WISHES.,"Engag'd in sober, social chat,--"
127,THE THREE WISHES.,When suddenly a flash of light
128,THE THREE WISHES.,Reveal'd to their astonish'd sight
129,THE THREE WISHES.,"A little form of lovely mien,"
130,THE THREE WISHES.,Epitome of Beauty's Queen.
131,THE THREE WISHES.,"Her zone was clasp'd with jewels rare,"
132,THE THREE WISHES.,"And roses bound her auburn hair,"
133,THE THREE WISHES.,"White was her robe, and in her hand"
134,THE THREE WISHES.,Graceful she wav'd an ivory wand.
135,THE THREE WISHES.,
136,THE THREE WISHES.,[Illustration]
137,THE THREE WISHES.,
138,THE THREE WISHES.,"Our couple started with surprise,"
139,THE THREE WISHES.,"And star'd at her--with all their eyes,"
140,THE THREE WISHES.,"Not guessing how or whence she came,"
141,THE THREE WISHES.,"What was her nature, or her name."
142,THE THREE WISHES.,At length their unexpected guest
143,THE THREE WISHES.,The trembling villagers address'd:
144,THE THREE WISHES.,
145,THE THREE WISHES.,"Mortals! she said, in me behold"
146,THE THREE WISHES.,A being of no earthly mold:--
147,THE THREE WISHES.,But fear me not; I visit earth
148,THE THREE WISHES.,To benefit your humble worth;
149,THE THREE WISHES.,"For this I've left the blissful land,"
150,THE THREE WISHES.,"Rul'd by Imperial Oberon's hand,"
151,THE THREE WISHES.,And on your cottage I intrude
152,THE THREE WISHES.,To pay a debt of gratitude.
153,THE THREE WISHES.,"For know, my friends, that every year"
154,THE THREE WISHES.,"I'm doom'd a mortal form to wear,"
155,THE THREE WISHES.,And for a time must undergo
156,THE THREE WISHES.,The sufferings earthly creatures know.
157,THE THREE WISHES.,Sometimes I wing my way a bird;
158,THE THREE WISHES.,Sometimes with beasts compelled to herd;
159,THE THREE WISHES.,A fish I plunge beneath the deep;
160,THE THREE WISHES.,Or in an insect's form I creep.
161,THE THREE WISHES.,Of late it was my fate to wear
162,THE THREE WISHES.,The semblance of the timid hare;
163,THE THREE WISHES.,And one cold morning in December
164,THE THREE WISHES.,"(The luckless day you may remember),"
165,THE THREE WISHES.,When winter stern in icy chains
166,THE THREE WISHES.,"Had bound the desolated plains,"
167,THE THREE WISHES.,"And withered every tender plant,"
168,THE THREE WISHES.,"A hare, compelled by urgent want,"
169,THE THREE WISHES.,Ventured within your garden pale
170,THE THREE WISHES.,To taste your parsley and your kale.
171,THE THREE WISHES.,"Soon of her steps you saw the trace,"
172,THE THREE WISHES.,And whistled Fury to the chace.
173,THE THREE WISHES.,"The fatal scent her track reveals,"
174,THE THREE WISHES.,And the fierce cur pursued her heels;
175,THE THREE WISHES.,Vain was her speed! her failing breath
176,THE THREE WISHES.,"Left her within the jaws of death,"
177,THE THREE WISHES.,"When doubling quick, thus sorely prest,"
178,THE THREE WISHES.,She sprang for shelter to your breast.
179,THE THREE WISHES.,"That breast, awake to pity's plea,"
180,THE THREE WISHES.,My kind protector! rescued me:
181,THE THREE WISHES.,"Your generous cares assuag'd my pangs,"
182,THE THREE WISHES.,And sav'd me from the terrier's fangs.
183,THE THREE WISHES.,"'Twas then I vow'd, the very hour"
184,THE THREE WISHES.,"That gave me back my form and power,"
185,THE THREE WISHES.,"To seek your humble roof with speed,"
186,THE THREE WISHES.,And recompense the gentle deed.
187,THE THREE WISHES.,
188,THE THREE WISHES.,[Illustration]
189,THE THREE WISHES.,
190,THE THREE WISHES.,"Now, by the honour of a Spright"
191,THE THREE WISHES.,"Who in good actions takes delight,"
192,THE THREE WISHES.,"By Mab, the sovereign of fays,"
193,THE THREE WISHES.,"Who sports beneath the moon's pale rays,"
194,THE THREE WISHES.,I grant to you and your good dame
195,THE THREE WISHES.,The first Three Wishes that you name!
196,THE THREE WISHES.,"Think what will best your state amend,"
197,THE THREE WISHES.,And claim it from your grateful friend!
198,THE THREE WISHES.,"Together you had best advise,"
199,THE THREE WISHES.,"And as you are _humane_, be _wise_!"
200,THE THREE WISHES.,"For should you foolishly decide,"
201,THE THREE WISHES.,By your own choice you must abide;
202,THE THREE WISHES.,"Nor further does my power extend,"
203,THE THREE WISHES.,Howe'er dispos'd to be your friend.
204,THE THREE WISHES.,
205,THE THREE WISHES.,"So saying, the benignant fay"
206,THE THREE WISHES.,Quick thro' the key-hole whisk'd away.
207,THE THREE WISHES.,
208,THE THREE WISHES.,"Our cottagers from fear relieved,"
209,THE THREE WISHES.,Scarcely their eyes and ears believ'd:
210,THE THREE WISHES.,"But ah! what passions, long suppress'd,"
211,THE THREE WISHES.,Were rous'd in each unguarded breast;
212,THE THREE WISHES.,"Ambition, that had dormant lain,"
213,THE THREE WISHES.,"And Pride, with Luxury in his train;"
214,THE THREE WISHES.,While Vanity performed her part
215,THE THREE WISHES.,In simple Susan's easy heart!
216,THE THREE WISHES.,
217,THE THREE WISHES.,"Suppose the joy that now abounded,"
218,THE THREE WISHES.,The exclamations that resounded:
219,THE THREE WISHES.,How strange! what luck! what can have brought it?
220,THE THREE WISHES.,Good lack! Dear me! Who would have thought it?
221,THE THREE WISHES.,What shall we wish for? let us ponder.
222,THE THREE WISHES.,"Lord, how the neighbours will all wonder!"
223,THE THREE WISHES.,
224,THE THREE WISHES.,"Quoth Homespun--if 'tis not a dream,"
225,THE THREE WISHES.,"I'll have a farm, and keep a team."
226,THE THREE WISHES.,
227,THE THREE WISHES.,"A farm! said Susan: on my life,"
228,THE THREE WISHES.,"I'll be no farmer's dowdy wife,"
229,THE THREE WISHES.,To toil and drudge thro' mud and mire:
230,THE THREE WISHES.,I hope you'll hold your head much higher.
231,THE THREE WISHES.,
232,THE THREE WISHES.,"Well, well, then--shall I be a Squire?--"
233,THE THREE WISHES.,"Methinks I should be somewhat proud,"
234,THE THREE WISHES.,To own the land which once I plough'd.
235,THE THREE WISHES.,"With money plenty in my bags,"
236,THE THREE WISHES.,I'd keep my gig and brace of nags;
237,THE THREE WISHES.,"My cellars should be duly stor'd,"
238,THE THREE WISHES.,And beef should smoke upon my board:
239,THE THREE WISHES.,Besides I'd keep my pack of hounds--
240,THE THREE WISHES.,Squire Homespun! Lord how fine it sounds!
241,THE THREE WISHES.,
242,THE THREE WISHES.,"Have it, said Susan, as you will;"
243,THE THREE WISHES.,But sure My Lord! sounds finer still;
244,THE THREE WISHES.,"Then I should be My Lady: Bless me,"
245,THE THREE WISHES.,How smart! how beautiful I'd dress me!
246,THE THREE WISHES.,"Such bonnets, mantles, ruffs, and puffs,"
247,THE THREE WISHES.,"Such gowns, and furbelows, and muffs,"
248,THE THREE WISHES.,"With chains and ear-rings, watch and broche,"
249,THE THREE WISHES.,And Madam Homespun in her coach:
250,THE THREE WISHES.,So grand! so stately! who but me?
251,THE THREE WISHES.,How mad my neighbour Barnes will be!
252,THE THREE WISHES.,
253,THE THREE WISHES.,"Peace, said the husband, pr'ythee, peace!"
254,THE THREE WISHES.,'Tis time this idle talk should cease:
255,THE THREE WISHES.,Consider what we have at stake!
256,THE THREE WISHES.,I fain some friend's advice would take:
257,THE THREE WISHES.,"At least we must be wise and wary,"
258,THE THREE WISHES.,As we were counsell'd by the fairy.
259,THE THREE WISHES.,"So hasten, dame, and fill the beaker,"
260,THE THREE WISHES.,And we'll discuss it o'er our liquor.
261,THE THREE WISHES.,
262,THE THREE WISHES.,'Tis vain to trace each various plan
263,THE THREE WISHES.,Which Susan form'd with her good man.
264,THE THREE WISHES.,"Or yet how oft they drain'd the cup,"
265,THE THREE WISHES.,Ere the long conference broke up:
266,THE THREE WISHES.,"But as opinions were divided,"
267,THE THREE WISHES.,The business still was undecided.
268,THE THREE WISHES.,In this dilemma the result
269,THE THREE WISHES.,Was--that their pillows they'd consult.
270,THE THREE WISHES.,"'Tis best to take more time to con it,"
271,THE THREE WISHES.,Quoth Homespun--so we'll sleep upon it:
272,THE THREE WISHES.,Our choice requires the coolest head;
273,THE THREE WISHES.,"So rake the fire, and we'll to bed."
274,THE THREE WISHES.,
275,THE THREE WISHES.,"Susan, the happiest wife on earth,"
276,THE THREE WISHES.,"Set all to rights, and brush'd her hearth;"
277,THE THREE WISHES.,"And said, These embers burn so clear,"
278,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!
279,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,Methinks 'twould broil so clean and nice;
280,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,I'd make it ready in a trice;
281,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,She spoke--and in the chimney rumbled
282,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,A noise--and down a pudding tumbled!
283,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,
284,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"The affrighted Susan stood amaz'd,"
285,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"With tearful eyes, and hands uprais'd,"
286,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"O'erwhelm'd with grief and self-reproach,"
287,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,Farewell! to Madam in her coach!
288,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"Her tongue itself forgot its use,--"
289,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,Tongue once so ready at excuse!
290,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,
291,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,[Illustration]
292,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,
293,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"Mean time the husband storm'd and rated,"
294,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,Swearing no man was e'er so mated;
295,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"And call'd his spouse--like savage shameless,"
296,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,By ugly words that must be nameless.
297,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,To throw our fortune thus away!
298,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,Aren't you a stupid idiot--hey?
299,I WISH WE HAD A PUDDING HERE!,"Such want of thought your folly shows,"
300,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!
301,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
302,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"The words escap'd, he gain'd his wish."
303,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"The pudding, rising from its dish,"
304,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,On Goody Homespun's nose was stuck
305,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"So fast, no power on earth could pluck"
306,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,The sad incumbrance away.
307,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"What could be done? Oh, hapless day!"
308,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"She cried, she stamp'd, she tore her hair;"
309,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,The fatal pudding still hung there.
310,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
311,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,[Illustration]
312,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
313,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Oh! I shall die, said she, with shame!"
314,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Now, Master--who is most to blame?"
315,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"My face again I ne'er can show,"
316,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,I shall be hooted as I go--
317,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,What will the neighbours say--Oh! oh!
318,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
319,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,The sorrowing husband now repented;
320,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,And Susan in her turn resented:
321,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"While he, with looks most melancholy,"
322,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,Confessed he'd equall'd her in folly;
323,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,Yet strove his weeping spouse to cheer:
324,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
325,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Don't be cast down, said he, my dear!"
326,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,Consider! we have one stake more.
327,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"We'll wish of wealth an endless store,"
328,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"And you shall have such gay rich clothes,"
329,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,That folks won't think about your nose:
330,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Nay, it will ornament your face,"
331,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,When cover'd with a golden case:
332,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Therefore, my dearest, calm your passion!"
333,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,We'll say nose-jewels are the fashion.
334,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
335,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Sad Susan wav'd her head in woe,"
336,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"The pudding too wav'd to and fro,"
337,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"While she exclaim'd, I tell you, No,"
338,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,You barbarous man! you talk in vain:
339,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,I'll never shew my face again:
340,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"I'll have no case of gold, not I;"
341,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"But lay me down at once, and die!"
342,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,
343,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Nay, said her mate--it shan't be so--"
344,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,I'd sooner our last hope forego.
345,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Our third wish will your peace restore,"
346,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,We are but where we were before.
347,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"I will my luckless wish revoke,"
348,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"Recall the words I rashly spoke,"
349,I WISH THE PUDDING ON YOUR NOSE!,"And to relieve you from this evil,"
350,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!
351,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,
352,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Obedient to this prudent wish,"
353,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"The pudding fell, and in its dish"
354,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Flew up the chimney as it came,"
355,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,And thus restor'd the suffering dame;
356,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Who, freed from anguish, now could show"
357,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,Her own dear nose--_in statu quo_:
358,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Yet scarce recovered, laugh'd and cried,"
359,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,'Twixt joy--and disappointed pride.
360,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,
361,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,[Illustration]
362,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,
363,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Quoth Homespun--To my mind, my dame,"
364,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,A tricking fairy is that same!
365,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,Why did she meddle thus about us?
366,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"To tempt us first, and then to flout us?--"
367,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"But let us not complain, my Sue;"
368,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"The fairy to her word was true,"
369,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"And if our schemes are overthrown,"
370,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"In faith, the fault is all our own."
371,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"A wholesome lesson she has taught,"
372,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Though it is somewhat dearly bought,"
373,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"And should she call another day,"
374,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,She'll find it is not thrown away--
375,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"For as we have regained our senses,"
376,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"We'll lay aside our vain pretences,"
377,I WISH THE PUDDING AT THE DEVIL!,"Temper our hopes with moderation,"
