1708,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"“We want a yellow pumpkin, very round”;"
1709,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"And the wind among the corn-stalks, where we stood a-hand-in-hand"
1710,THE JACK O’LANTERN,Made a funny little rattling sort of sound;
1711,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"It was very bright and frosty, and the man said, “Come with me,--"
1712,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"I will find you what you want, if you will wait”;"
1713,THE JACK O’LANTERN,Then he took us through the corn-lines past the heavy apple trees;
1714,THE JACK O’LANTERN,There were piles of yellow pumpkins by the gate.
1715,THE JACK O’LANTERN,
1716,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"And he asked, “To make a pie with? or to roll upon the ground?”"
1717,THE JACK O’LANTERN,And he smiled when little brother shook his head;
1718,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"Then, “I really won’t be guessing, but I think I know the kind--"
1719,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"I was little once myself, you know,” he said;"

1722,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"Then he made a wink at brother, and a funny face at me,"
1723,THE JACK O’LANTERN,And he set the pumpkin up upon the wall.
1724,THE JACK O’LANTERN,
1725,THE JACK O’LANTERN,“‘Tis the king of all the others!” cried the cheery garden-man;
1726,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"“I’ll be scooping out the middle, if you say”;"

1728,THE JACK O’LANTERN,And we watched him while he cut the heart away;
1729,THE JACK O’LANTERN,Then he asked us--“And his eyes? Shall his nose be long and wise?
1730,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"Shall he have a ragged, jagged sort of smile?”"
1731,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"And we told the garden-man, “Please, as quickly as you can;"
1732,THE JACK O’LANTERN,We can only wait a very little while.”
1733,THE JACK O’LANTERN,
1734,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"Then he laid the knife beside him, as he said, “Here is the man;"
1735,THE JACK O’LANTERN,He’ll be looking very happy with a light”;
1736,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"And we rolled him in our jackets, as we thanked the garden-man,"
1737,THE JACK O’LANTERN,And we hurried home to wait until the night;
1738,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"Then a little moon is shining; then we’ll hide behind the wall,"
1739,THE JACK O’LANTERN,And we’ll put the yellow candle in its place;
1740,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"In the pretty lighted windows of the children that we know,"
1741,THE JACK O’LANTERN,"While the fathers read the papers, and the mothers sit and sew,"
1742,THE JACK O’LANTERN,There will shine a merry Jack O’Lantern face.

2350,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,Joy was the chief of the laughter-mill; high on a sun-topped peak
2351,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"He had builded it up at the rainbow’s end, happily, week by week;"
2352,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,And years and years and years had passed; and still the old mill stood
2353,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"Strong as a fort; and it worked away, singing the song of the good."
2354,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,
2355,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,Joy was the chief of the laughter-mill; in it worked Fun and Gay
2356,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"And Dimple-my-Chin and the Chuckle boys, turning the wheels all day;"
2357,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"And every night when the sun was low, and they turned away from the door,"
2358,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"There were piles of laughs all ready to wear, in good neat rows on the floor."
2359,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,
2360,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"Some of the laughs were the largest size, as large as a man might please,"
2361,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,Some were the kind that were hard to use; there were not so many of these.
2362,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"Some were quite sober, and some were bright, and all were"
2363,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"turned up at the ends,"
2364,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"With an extra package of Gigglequicks, for young little girls"
2365,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,and their friends.
2366,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,
2367,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,Joy made the styles in his laughter-mill; some of the smiles were sweet;
2368,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"Some were to wear in a happy home, and some were for use on the street;"
2369,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"But Dimple-my-Chin and the Chuckle boys worked lovingest, best, I hear,"
2370,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,"On a soft little laugh that was stirred in a heart, and"
2371,THE LAUGHTER-MILL,made of a precious tear.

2384,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"Where nights the shadows gathered, and dancing lessons gave."
2385,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,
2386,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"At eight o’clock each night she woke: “It’s time to rise, I guess”;"
2387,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"She shook her tangled hair out, and donned a silver dress;"
2388,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"She washed her hands in water, that ran as cold as snow,"
2389,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"And packed a little basket, with the sweetest things that grow."

2391,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"And then she sang; “And now, away!” and flew up to the sky,"

2393,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"The willow threw her kisses, and the breeze laughed, “I’m along,”"

2396,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"The moon, her patient sister, was waiting in the blue,"
2397,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"How could she leave for supper, with so many things to do?"
2398,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"She must keep the little stars awake, and put the breeze to sleep;"
2399,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,"And scare away the cloud-folk, who crowded round like sheep."
2400,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,
2401,LITTLE SISTER OF THE MOON,So Little Sister comes to her; she flies before her face.

2413,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2414,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"The little brown sandman lives, you know,"
2415,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,On the top of the hill where the poppies grow;
2416,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,The roof of his house is a great toadstool
2417,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"With a wee bell-tower, like the village school;"
2418,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And tumbling and heaping about the door
2419,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,Are piles of sand from the white seashore.
2420,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2421,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"The little brown sandman, bent and thin,"
2422,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,Has a deep blue cloak that he wraps up in;
2423,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,His peaked hat has a star on top
2424,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And he fastens his cloak with a green gumdrop;
2425,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,He’s always sleepy; a slow man he;
2426,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And he stretches and yawns at half-past three.
2427,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2428,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,Now the greatest joy in the sandman’s life
2429,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"Is Polly M’ Pumpkin, the sandman’s wife;"
2430,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"She’s a round little soul, with a rosy face,"
2431,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And she bustles and bounces about the place;
2432,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,The children the sandman goes to see
2433,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,_She_ loves a great deal more than he.

2439,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,Then Polly M’ Pumpkin wakes him up
2440,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"As he sits asleep, by his blue tea-cup;"
2441,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"“The children are nodding now,” she cries,"
2442,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,“Go sprinkle the sea-sand upon their eyes!”
2443,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2444,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"And she hands him a sack, when he blinks and starts,"
2445,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"“For My Sleepiest Children” (ah, bless their hearts!)"
2446,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And quite unknown to the brown sandman
2447,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"She has mixed it up, as she only can,"
2448,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"With magical sugar, as sweet as a rose,"
2449,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,That brings good dreams wherever it goes.
2450,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2451,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"“Now hurry away!” she cries, and stands,"
2452,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"On the flat door-stone, and waves her hands;"
2453,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,The little brown sandman slips away
2454,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,Till he’s lost in the stars of the milky way;
2455,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"“He’d never get started in all his life,"
2456,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"If it wasn’t for me,” says the sandman’s wife."
2457,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,
2458,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"Then she climbs the bell-tower, up on the house,"
2459,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"And she peers about, like a bright-eyed mouse;"
2460,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"And she says to herself, as she always does,"
2461,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"“I’ll let him sleep some night, because"
2462,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,"_I’m_ going to go, in my husband’s place,”"
2463,THE SANDMAN’S WIFE,And a mischievous smile lights up her face.

2473,DREAMS FOR THREE,Three little dreams flew in from the south
2474,DREAMS FOR THREE,And they flew in a swift straight line
2475,DREAMS FOR THREE,And one was a dream of peaches and cream
2476,DREAMS FOR THREE,And that little dream was mine;
2477,DREAMS FOR THREE,I dreamed that a pretty white cloth was spread
2478,DREAMS FOR THREE,With the round moon set for a dish
2479,DREAMS FOR THREE,And I ate in state of peaches and cream
2480,DREAMS FOR THREE,As much as my heart could wish.

2482,DREAMS FOR THREE,The next little dream was a funny one;
2483,DREAMS FOR THREE,It came to Molly O’Lear;
2484,DREAMS FOR THREE,She thought that she rode on a great green goose
2485,DREAMS FOR THREE,That bucked like a Texas steer;
2486,DREAMS FOR THREE,"It flopped about, till it knocked her off,"
2487,DREAMS FOR THREE,And it cackled “Gingerbread Joke;”
2488,DREAMS FOR THREE,"And Molly wondered what that could be,"
2489,DREAMS FOR THREE,"And while she was wondering, woke."
2490,DREAMS FOR THREE,
2491,DREAMS FOR THREE,The last little dream was the best of all.
2492,DREAMS FOR THREE,It flew to Elizabeth Lee.
2493,DREAMS FOR THREE,"She swung in a hammock, embroidered with snails,"
2494,DREAMS FOR THREE,Way up to the top of a tree;

2496,DREAMS FOR THREE,"In a sort of a cottony nest,"
