33,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
34,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,The author and artist of this book are so much better known in
35,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"connection with other kinds of literary and artistic work, that a word"
36,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"concerning its origin will be in order. Just before Christmas, 1897, Mr."
37,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"Willard, the artist, sent to his friend Dr. Barton twenty pencil"
38,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,sketches illustrating the evolution of a pumpkin pie. Dr. Barton wrote
39,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,some verses to accompany them for his own children. They gave so much
40,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"pleasure to his little people and to others, and were enjoyed by so many"
41,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"older people as well, that the author and artist have consented to give"
42,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,them to other children.

47,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
48,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,Dr. Barton is well known as the author of more pretentious works in
49,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"theology, history, and fiction, and Mr. Willard is known as the painter"
50,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"of “Yankee Doodle,” the most famous patriotic picture painted in this"
51,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"country. His “Minute Men of the Revolution” is hardly less noted, and"
52,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"not less meritorious. His comical pictures also are widely known, with"
53,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,humor varying from the quiet Sunday smile that goes with “Pitching the
54,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"Tune,” to the rollicking, boisterous laugh belonging to “The Drummer’s"
55,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,Latest Yarn.”
56,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
57,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,[Illustration]
58,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
59,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,But Mr. Willard first became known to the public as a painter of
60,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,children. His first pictures to attract attention of the public were a
61,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"pair called “Pluck,” representing a homemade cart occupied by some"
62,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"little folks, and drawn by a dog in hot pursuit of a rabbit. These made"
63,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"their advent twenty odd years ago when the chromo was in its glory, and"
64,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,found their way into thousands of homes.
65,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
66,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,[Illustration]
67,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
68,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,It is interesting to notice the recurrence of the theme in these
69,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"pictures. There is still a dog, and the children must be a generation"
70,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"younger than those in “Pluck,” but they are the same sturdy,"
71,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"industrious, plucky little people."
72,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,
73,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,Mr. Willard’s children are always wholesome and attractive. They are
74,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,"honest, happy, unspoiled little folks, full of fun and ingenuity, and"
75,PUBLISHER’S PREFACE,good companions for boys and girls everywhere.

119,I,"“Hurrah!” cried Carl, “the sun shines gay;"
120,I,The winter’s gone. It’s warm to-day!
121,I,Let’s gather sticks in the garden lot
122,I,And make a jolly fire. Why not?”
123,I,
124,I,"Then out ran Fred, and Helen, too,"
125,I,And Towser came to help them through.
126,I,"They raked the sticks, the weeds they brought,"
127,I,And every brier and twig they sought.
128,I,
129,I,It made a heap ere they did stop;
130,I,Fred’s head was lower than the top.
131,I,"They lit the pile, the flames rose high;"
132,I,They laughed to see the bright sparks fly!

144,II,"Said Carl next day, “Now, Fred, we’ve found"
145,II,That we can work. Let’s plow the ground.
146,II,"We’ll make a garden all our own,"
147,II,And have a pumpkin in it grown.”
148,II,
149,II,"A forkéd stick they quickly got,"
150,II,And started there to plow the lot.
151,II,"Carl was a horse, the dog another;"
152,II,The plowman was the younger brother.
153,II,
154,II,"They turned a furrow deep and wide,"
155,II,And Helen walked the plow beside;
156,II,"And Nell cried, “Gee!” and Fred said, “Whoa!”"
157,II,And merrily did the plowing go.

169,III,"But though they toiled and did not shirk,"
170,III,Their plowing proved too much like work.
171,III,"The plow was dull, the harness frail,"
172,III,Their plowing seemed but doomed to fail.
173,III,
174,III,"Old Towser, who did not complain,"
175,III,"Showed that he felt the heavy strain,"
176,III,"And when they looked across the patch,"
177,III,Their furrow only seemed a scratch!
178,III,
179,III,Carl panted hard and scratched his head.
180,III,“I’ve had enough of that!” he said.
181,III,"And Helen said, “Wait, boys, I’ll show"
182,III,You how to plow with spade and hoe!”

194,IV,"They dug away till almost noon,"
195,IV,With spade and hoe and great big spoon.
196,IV,"And Towser dug at a wee round hole,"
197,IV,Pretending that he smelt a mole.
198,IV,
199,IV,The hours sped by as if on wings;
200,IV,Swift goes the day that pleasure brings.
201,IV,"And deep they dug the mellow soil,"
202,IV,And raked it smooth with patient toil.
203,IV,
204,IV,"The noon bell rang; they cried, “Look here!"
205,IV,"See how we’re digging, mother, dear!"
206,IV,We’re nearly through. It can’t be noon!
207,IV,Keep dinner hot; we’ll be there soon!”

220,V,"It makes folks hungry, thus to play."
221,V,"They ate their fill of bread and meat,"
222,V,And mother smiled to see them eat.
223,V,
224,V,"Soon as the dinner-hour was done,"
225,V,Back to the garden did they run;
226,V,"And Helen bore, as swift she ran,"
227,V,Some pumpkin seeds in a small tin pan.
228,V,
229,V,"Fred dug a hole that was nice and round,"
230,V,And Charlie planted them in the ground;
231,V,And Towser gazed as though he wanted
232,V,To eat the pie before ’twas planted!

242,VI,
243,VI,
244,VI,They waited for the seeds to start;
245,VI,And patience is as great an art
246,VI,As farming is; but you must know
247,VI,Without it pumpkins will not grow!
248,VI,
249,VI,"So many times they looked in vain,"
250,VI,They thought they would not go again.
251,VI,"Busy with other kinds of play,"
252,VI,A week or more they stayed away.
253,VI,
254,VI,"They waited till they ’most forgot,"
255,VI,"But one day, crossing o’er the lot,"
256,VI,"They went to look, and cried, “At last"
257,VI,"They’re up, and they are growing fast!”"

269,VII,"Well, after that there was much to do,"
270,VII,But day and night the wee vines grew.
271,VII,"Each day they helped their mother dear,"
272,VII,Each week some wonder did appear.
273,VII,
274,VII,"A yellow flower one day they found,"
275,VII,"In two weeks more a green ball round,"
276,VII,That grew upon the pumpkin vine:
277,VII,"And Carl and Fred cried, “This is fine!”"
278,VII,
279,VII,Fred watched it with an eager eye
280,VII,"And said, “Now we shall have some pie!”"
281,VII,And Helen called old Towser near
282,VII,"And said, “A baby pumpkin, dear!”"

292,VIII,
293,VIII,
294,VIII,"So June passed on, and warm July,"
295,VIII,And up the corn grew rank and high;
296,VIII,"Beyond where they their seed had sown,"
297,VIII,"The cornfield stretched, a forest grown."
298,VIII,
299,VIII,Upon the fence the children sat
300,VIII,With bare brown feet and torn straw hat.
301,VIII,Between the corn-rows on the ground
302,VIII,"Their pumpkin lay, large, green, and round."
303,VIII,
304,VIII,"And Charlie said, “Our pumpkin soon"
305,VIII,Will be as big as the great round moon.”
306,VIII,And Towser peered o’er the fence so high
307,VIII,With a knowing look in his wise old eye.

319,IX,"When autumn came, the children three,"
320,IX,"With books and lunch and noisy glee,"
321,IX,"Went off to school, their tasks to learn,"
322,IX,And Towser waited their return.
323,IX,
324,IX,"And then, so short had grown the day,"
325,IX,"They had but little time for play,"
326,IX,"But drove the cows, the chickens fed,"
327,IX,Then supper ate and went to bed.
328,IX,
329,IX,"But Saturdays they viewed their prize,"
330,IX,"And, lo, it grew to monstrous size!"
331,IX,And autumn sunbeams shining down
332,IX,Colored the pumpkin golden brown.

343,X,
344,X,"Then came October clear and chill,"
345,X,With frosts that unripe pumpkins kill.
346,X,They shivered in their beds so warm
347,X,Lest Jack Frost should their pumpkin harm.
348,X,
349,X,But by and by they all agreed
350,X,Their pumpkin now was ripe indeed.
351,X,"And on the next bright Saturday,"
352,X,"’Twas warm, and fine for work or play,"
353,X,
354,X,They harnessed Towser to the cart
355,X,And for the garden-lot did start.
356,X,"The pumpkin loaded they with skill,"
357,X,While Helen held old Towser still.

369,XI,Behold the pumpkin borne in state
370,XI,"Adown the field and toward the gate,"
371,XI,"With Helen perched upon its crest,"
372,XI,And Towser doing quite his best!
373,XI,
374,XI,No queen upon a gilded throne
375,XI,More royally than Helen shone;
376,XI,No steed more proud than Towser bore
377,XI,A princess to the palace door.
378,XI,
379,XI,"The cart wheels rumbled o’er the road,"
380,XI,And creaked beneath their heavy load.
381,XI,"The boys cried loudly, “Here we come!"
382,XI,We’re going to haul our pumpkin home!”

394,XII,"“Let dogs delight to bark and bite,”"
395,XII,So Towser thought he had a right
396,XII,To chase a neighbor’s cur away
397,XII,Who came intruding that high day.
398,XII,
399,XII,"He barked, he growled, laid back his ears,"
400,XII,’Spite Carl’s rebuke and Helen’s fears.
401,XII,"Nell tugged the lines; the boys cried, “Whoa!”"
402,XII,But fiercely on did Towser go!
403,XII,
404,XII,"The neighbor dog fled like the wind,"
405,XII,And Towser followed hard behind
406,XII,"They struck a stone; out tumbled Nell,"
407,XII,And out the precious pumpkin fell!

420,XIII,In telling dogs to bark and bite!
421,XIII,"O Towser, thou didst little know"
422,XIII,How great the wreck thy wrath would show!
423,XIII,
424,XIII,The man who says that childhood’s woes
425,XIII,"Are small, but little childhood knows."
426,XIII,"The children wept and scolded sore,"
427,XIII,And Towser they would love no more!
428,XIII,
429,XIII,"But through their tears like summer rain,"
430,XIII,The sun of hope shone out again.
431,XIII,"One glad discovery came to light,"
432,XIII,“The pumpkin isn’t hurt a mite!”

444,XIV,What did it matter after that
445,XIV,If Helen’s head and Helen’s hat
446,XIV,Were badly damaged by the fall?
447,XIV,The pumpkin was not harmed at all!
448,XIV,
449,XIV,"“Cheer up!” cried Carl. “Nell, do not cry!"
450,XIV,It still will make a monstrous pie.
451,XIV,"Your hat’s all right. ’Twas pretty old,"
452,XIV,"And mother, I am sure, won’t scold!”"
453,XIV,
454,XIV,They dried their tears and soon did start
455,XIV,To seek their steed and broken cart.
456,XIV,"Towser, who waited them hard by,"
457,XIV,But wagged his tail and winked his eye!

470,XV,But these young folks knew what to do.
471,XV,"The saw and hammer quick they brought,"
472,XV,And all their skill and wisdom sought.
473,XV,
474,XV,"The wagon was in such a plight,"
475,XV,To mend it took till almost night.
476,XV,"The boys their anger soon forgot,"
477,XV,"And Helen, too, the aching spot."
478,XV,
479,XV,"Towser so penitent appeared,"
480,XV,"They did not chide, because they feared"
481,XV,To grieve him. So repose he sought
482,XV,While they repaired the ill he’d wrought.

496,XVI,"They rolled it in, and to the door"
497,XVI,The pumpkin now with joy they bore!
498,XVI,
499,XVI,"Yet Charlie held to Towser’s rein,"
500,XVI,Lest he should chase a dog again.
501,XVI,But never horse more faithful proved
502,XVI,Than Towser to the lads he loved.
503,XVI,
504,XVI,And mother met them at the door:
505,XVI,“I never saw the like before!”
506,XVI,Was what she said; and her surprise
507,XVI,Was better than a hundred pies!

519,XVII,Thanksgiving Day was drawing near
520,XVII,With memories of a happy year.
521,XVII,The children to the woodshed went
522,XVII,"And to the axe their backs they bent,"
523,XVII,
524,XVII,In golden crescents cut their prize
525,XVII,To make it into pumpkin pies;
526,XVII,"Yet saved the seeds to plant next spring,"
527,XVII,That these might other pumpkins bring.
528,XVII,
529,XVII,"A smaller pumpkin had they still,"
530,XVII,And carved it out with wondrous skill.
531,XVII,"Made eyes and mouth, put in a light,"
532,XVII,A funny lantern ’twas at night!

544,XVIII,"Then mother cooked each golden slice,"
545,XVIII,"And seasoned it with sweet and spice,"
546,XVIII,And rolled the crust so crisp and thin
547,XVIII,To bake the precious pumpkin in.
548,XVIII,
549,XVIII,"The children pressed the table nigh,"
550,XVIII,"Until the oven claimed the pie,"
551,XVIII,And then with appetites most keen
552,XVIII,They scraped the pan and licked it clean.
553,XVIII,
554,XVIII,"Old Towser, who was always there,"
555,XVIII,Looked up and seemed to want a share.
556,XVIII,"When their share ended his began,"

573,XIX,
574,XIX,The minister to the people read
575,XIX,"The words the governor had said,"

577,XIX,They all should very thankful be.
