175,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"Thus on he drove that spotted bull,"

190,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"All gored and prostrate in his blood,"
191,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"He lies upon the ground,"
192,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,While the unsated red one toward
193,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,The deacon made a bound.
194,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
195,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,Down from the bars where he was perched.
196,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"Aghast, the good man sprung,"

198,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,You'd said that he was young.
199,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
200,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,Still after him with fury

204,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
205,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"Through kitchen and through parlor fine,"
206,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"Breathless, the poor man flew,"
207,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,And lo! the bull is at his heels

209,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
210,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,A flight of stairs is all that's left

244,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
245,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"To yonder house we turn again,"
246,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,And to the quiet throng
247,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"The preacher now has said, Amen!"
248,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,Now ends the choral song.
249,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
250,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,And friendly speech and courtesies

264,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
265,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"All seated now, with solemn air,"
266,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"And with a placid smile,"
267,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,Such words of truth the parson spoke

284,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
285,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"And with a little spice of wit,"
286,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"To which he was inclined,"
287,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"Though none to spare the deacon had,"
288,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,He thus relieved his mind:
289,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,
290,THE STORY OF THE TWO BULLS.,"""I've often heard the preacher say"
