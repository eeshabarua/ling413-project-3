119,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
120,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
121,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"The north-west wind, driving feathery flakes of snow before it, heaps"
122,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"up gray masses of cloud over the sunny afternoon, and then, as if bent"
123,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"on subduing what cheeriness remains among the shadows it has brought,"
124,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"howls dismally down the chimneys, moans at the casements dismally. The"
125,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"Lieutenant throws himself down on the lounge, and draws a long sigh. Kate"
126,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"slips quietly out of the room, catches up her shawl and hat from the rack"
127,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"in the hall, and her brother, hearing her go down the steps into the"
128,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"street, wonders where she is bound for, and why she didn’t say something"
129,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"about it, and then falls back into his gloomy reverie."
130,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
131,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“It may be ‘sweet for one’s country to die’; but to live on, a shattered,"
132,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"helpless wreck”—and, at the thought, he gripes the curving frame of the"
133,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"lounge with his one hand, and his firm-set lips quiver; when, suddenly,"
134,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"without the faintest footfall to indicate the approach of any one, two"
135,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"little arms creep about his neck, and between silvery peals of laughter"
136,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"a shower of kisses falls over forehead and sightless eyes, on either"
137,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"cheek, on nose, mouth and chin. “There!” cries a childish, laughing"
138,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"voice, “I surpized you, didn’t I? Ha, ha, ha!”"
139,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
140,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Ha, ha!” echoes the Lieutenant, coming directly from a horizontal to a"
141,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"sitting posture, his arm around the wee mite, “so you did ‘surpize’ me,"
142,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,midget. And where did you come from? Did you drop out of the sky?”
143,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
144,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Out of the sky!” repeats the little maiden, with a great deal of scorn"
145,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"and emphasis. “Why, I comed right from our house! Katy comed after me,"
146,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"and we went round to the back door, so you wouldn’t hear, and then Katy"
147,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"took off my shoes, and I comed up on tiptoe in my stocking-feet. Ha, ha!"
148,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"I surpized you, didn’t I? I’m go’n to ’gin!” and away she rushes across"
149,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"the room and back against him, pell-mell, arms about his neck, and kisses"
150,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,raining all over his face. “There! how do you like it?” and the room
151,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"rings with her musical laughter—in which the Lieutenant once more joins,"
152,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,with—
153,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
154,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“My dear young lady, I must confess that I haven’t the least objection to"
155,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,the proceeding.”
156,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
157,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Young—_la_-day!” is the slow and scornful rejoinder; “young _la_-dy!
158,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"Why, I’m a little girl!”"
159,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
160,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Why, so she is, just a mere baby.”"
161,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
162,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“A _ba_-by! (the italics are to mark the emphasis) I’m four-years-old
163,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,big! _I_’m no _ba_-by! Willie’s the baby. He’s got a new tooth! That
164,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,makes three—six—five! He’s got five teeth!”
165,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
166,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“You don’t say! And what is this Edith has in her hands—a doll?”
167,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
168,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Yes, it’s my dolly.”"
169,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
170,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“What curly hair she has. And this ruffled affair—is it an apron?”
171,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
172,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“An _a_-pron! It’s an over-skirt!”
173,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
174,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Oh, I beg pardon! an ‘over-skirt,’ is it? So she’s a fashionable doll."
175,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,What might be her name?”
176,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
177,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Guess.”
178,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
179,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Keturah?”
180,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
181,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“No.”
182,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
183,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Jerusha?”
184,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
185,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“No.”
186,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
187,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Mary Ann, Sacharissa, Sophia, Clarissa, Joan, Melissa, Eloise,"
188,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"Elizabeth, Jane—”"
189,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
190,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“No-o-o-o-o!”
191,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
192,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Victoria, Eugenia, Augusta, Paulina, Virginia, Aurelia, Geraldine,"
193,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,Mollie—”
194,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
195,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Yes! Mollie! that’s what it is; but none of your other old—elephants.
196,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"There, you’re laughing! You knowed what it was all the time; you was only"
197,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,pertendin’. You’ve seen my dolly before.”
198,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
199,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Where’s Katy?”
200,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
201,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“She stayed down-stairs to pop some corn for me and you.”
202,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
203,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Shall we go down and see her do it?”
204,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
205,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Yes.”
206,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
207,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Very well.” And the Lieutenant, rising, manages to shift little dot up"
208,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"to his shoulder. “There, now, you’re a feather on top of a barn-door.”"
209,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
210,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“You’re _not_ a barn-door!”
211,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
212,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“What am I, then?”"
213,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
214,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“You’re my brave captain boy.” (That was in a whisper.)
215,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
216,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Shall I tell you what _you_ are? You’re my little angel.” And, holding"
217,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"her carefully, he goes down the stairs, feeling his way, now and then,"
218,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,with the remnant of an arm in his dangling right sleeve.
219,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
220,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“I’m almost through,” cries Kate, from the kitchen, her face all"
221,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"aglow with the heat. And Edith, from her lofty perch, watches the few"
222,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,yellow kernels that are nearly lost sight of in the bottom of the wire
223,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"corn-popper, after a shake or two over the hot coals, suddenly—“Snap,"
224,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"snap, snap!” and look! it is full to the brim with something white and"
225,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"savory, which, seasoned with salt and the least bit of butter, she deals"
226,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,out (with great fairness and impartiality) to herself and her “captain
227,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"boy,” after they have gone up-stairs again. By and by a thought strikes"
228,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,her.
229,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
230,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Katy, my doll hasn’t got any apron.”"
231,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
232,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Why, so she hasn’t. We’ll have to make her one, won’t we?” And a box of"
233,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"ribbons and laces and pieces of silk is produced from somewhere, and the"
234,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"two sit down on the floor near the Lieutenant’s chair, talking all the"
235,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,time and planning out this wonderful apron.
236,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
237,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“Now which of all these colors does Edie like best?” asks Kate.
238,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
239,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Well, I think the red’s the nicest.”"
240,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
241,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"So an apron (with pockets, observe!) is soon manufactured out of a bit"
242,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"of a broad scarlet sash, and braided, too, with white silk braid; and"
243,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"straightway on it goes, in feverish haste (one is anxious to study the"
244,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"effect, you know), over the stylish (but serene) Mademoiselle’s black"
245,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,satin gown. (The effect isn’t bad.)
246,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
247,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"After due admiration from Edith, some other diversion is in order, and a"
248,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,book of engravings is brought for inspection. As the leaves are turned
249,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"for her she glances for an instant at one picture after another, giving"
250,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,the word to proceed; but they finally come to something over which she
251,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,pores a long while—so long that Kate is passing to the next without
252,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"waiting for the “Go on” from little Miss, when the latter immediately"
253,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"takes the book into her own hands, returns to this picture, and continues"
254,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,to gaze at it. “What does it mean?” at length she asks.
255,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
256,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Had I better tell her?” Kate, in an under-tone, questions of her"
257,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,brother. “It’s Gustave Doré’s ‘The Deluge’—people and wild beasts
258,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"huddled together upon a rock rising out of the waste of water, and the"
259,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"great, lashing waves reaching up for them greedily, like wide-mouthed"
260,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"monsters. Odd, isn’t it, that she should notice it so, among so many more"
261,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,attractive prints? She wouldn’t be likely to comprehend if I were to
262,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"explain, would she? Good, there goes the tea-bell!” And Kate closes the"
263,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"book, glad of an excuse to escape telling the story of the flood to this"
264,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"blithesome little being, whom, she has a dim notion, it might give bad"
265,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,dreams.
266,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
267,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"Seated at the supper-table, and elevated to the common level by aid"
268,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"of three sofa-cushions, Edith for a few moments bestows particular"
269,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"attentions upon a sauce-plate of canned peaches, to the utter disregard"
270,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"of more substantial food. After which she sits back in her chair, and,"
271,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"inclining her head toward her hostess, whispers—"
272,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
273,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Some of the cake, if you please.”"
274,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
275,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“But you haven’t eaten your bread and butter yet; eat that first, and"
276,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,then you shall have some cake.”
277,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
278,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“I want it now,” responds the small person, with much firmness, and is"
279,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,directly supplied with the desired article—a measure which might meet
280,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"with protest if Edith’s mamma were present. No, it wouldn’t, either,"
281,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"come to think of it, for Edith’s mamma knows what are Kate’s ideas"
282,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"concerning sweetmeats. Has she not, on a similar occasion, heard her"
283,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,express herself after this manner?—
284,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
285,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“If unfeeling people _will persist_ in denying dainties to the wee folks,"
286,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,they may just keep the stuff out of sight. Set it right where the poor
287,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"little things can watch it with wistful eyes, and then pass it around"
288,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"to the favored few, but for them—‘No, _you_ can’t have any. It isn’t"
289,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"healthy for you!’ If grown-up people can’t deny themselves such things,"
290,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,they haven’t any right to expect the children to. To require children to
291,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"show more strength of character than they have themselves!—oh, it’s a"
292,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"downright shame! And then, leaving open the places where the forbidden"
293,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"fruit is kept, and when the midgets climb up the closet-shelves and take"
294,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"a bite, on the sly, finding fault with them! Leading them into temptation"
295,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,(and isn’t that what responsible people even _pray_ to be delivered
296,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"from?) and then, when the poor little things fall into the very trap"
297,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"they have set, finding fault with them, and lecturing them, and all that"
298,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"nonsense! Oh, it’s a cruel shame!”"
299,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
300,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"The speaker, you see, is the children’s zealous advocate; and, little"
301,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"people, if ever there is anything you especially covet, or if ever you"
302,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"get into trouble, just go to her. She will plead your cause with burning"
303,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"cheeks, and flashing eyes, and such withering eloquence that the stern"
304,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,household judges will not fail to relent.
305,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
306,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"But it is after dark, and the snow is falling heavily, and mamma will"
307,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"want her little Edith home. So Kate sets forth with her small charge,"
308,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,well wrapped and protected from the cold—although they have but a few
309,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"steps to go, as Edith lives in the next house."
310,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
311,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"When Kate returns, her brother’s voice greets her from the parlor with—"
312,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
313,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Sukie, heard of the last new poem?”"
314,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
315,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“No. What is it?”
316,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
317,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Oh, it’s an epic!—a grand affair—second only to the Iliad!”"
318,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
319,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“Strange I haven’t heard of it, isn’t it?”"
320,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
321,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“No, not so very; it hasn’t come out yet.”"
322,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,
323,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,“How did you hear of it? Some one been in while I was gone?”
324,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,

329,NEIGHBOR EDITH.,"“It’s about a child, I believe—but modesty forbids my mentioning the name"

364,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,"And when, in short-lived moods of thoughtful silence,"
365,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,"You feel her tiny form against you lean,"

367,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,"Come creeping trustfully your own between,"
368,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,
369,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,"Somehow there’s soothing in the touch, you fancy,"

372,“NEIGHBOR EDITH.”,"This wee, wee elf the wind could blow away."

385,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“Heigho-ho!” yawned Harry, who had dropped in one evening, and curled"
386,CASTLE MARVEL.,"himself up in his favorite nook, the chimney-corner. “I wish books had"
387,CASTLE MARVEL.,"never been invented, or schools either, for that matter. I’ve been"
388,CASTLE MARVEL.,"digging away at one of Æsop’s fables for the last two hours, and I can’t"
389,CASTLE MARVEL.,make any sense out of it at all. It’s a lot of stuff about some doves
390,CASTLE MARVEL.,and hawks that got to fighting; but whether the doves eat up the hawks
391,CASTLE MARVEL.,"or not, how’s a fellow going to find out? And I got stuck in my algebra,"
392,CASTLE MARVEL.,"too, and I sha’n’t have a single decent lesson to-morrow, and then"
393,CASTLE MARVEL.,"old Williams’ll give me a lecture and a zero, and—well, a fellow gets"
394,CASTLE MARVEL.,"disgusted with that sort of thing for a steady diet. Oh, I tell you I’ll"
395,CASTLE MARVEL.,"be glad when once I’m out of school, and the pesky business is done with!"
396,CASTLE MARVEL.,"What’s the use of it, anyhow? I wish I didn’t have to go another day.”"
397,CASTLE MARVEL.,
398,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“But the time would be apt to hang pretty heavily on your hands, wouldn’t"
399,CASTLE MARVEL.,it?”
400,CASTLE MARVEL.,
401,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“Oh, I’d find plenty to do to fill up the time, never you fear! Now all"
402,CASTLE MARVEL.,"these splendid days, along back, when I ought to have been down at the"
403,CASTLE MARVEL.,"rink, skating, and there I had to sit in that stupid old schoolroom,"
404,CASTLE MARVEL.,moping over a desk! It makes me mad to think of it. But I came over—I
405,CASTLE MARVEL.,got so tired studying. I thought maybe you’d have some story or other to
406,CASTLE MARVEL.,"tell, Lieutenant.”"
407,CASTLE MARVEL.,
408,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“A story; what is there you haven’t heard, I wonder? I’m afraid my stock"
409,CASTLE MARVEL.,"of stories has about run out. Let me see, though,—have you ever heard"
410,CASTLE MARVEL.,about Castle Marvel?”
411,CASTLE MARVEL.,
412,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“A castle! that’s the kind I like—about castles! no, I never heard it.”"
413,CASTLE MARVEL.,
414,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“Well, this was a famous castle that stood upon a high mountain, and that"
415,CASTLE MARVEL.,"people sometimes went to see. Among the rest, there went from a certain"
416,CASTLE MARVEL.,"city a company of youths. Now, their route lay across a sunny plain that"
417,CASTLE MARVEL.,was like a very fairy-land; flowers covered it with every hue of the
418,CASTLE MARVEL.,"rainbow, and over these hovered clouds of golden-winged butterflies; and"
419,CASTLE MARVEL.,in the shady groves zephyrs sang and birds caroled as never sang zephyrs
420,CASTLE MARVEL.,or caroled birds anywhere else.
421,CASTLE MARVEL.,
422,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“And, so, many of the youths tarried, saying, ‘It is pleasant here; let"
423,CASTLE MARVEL.,"us gather roses;’ or, ‘Let us chase butterflies;’ or, ‘Let us lie down"
424,CASTLE MARVEL.,"under the wide-spreading branches, and listen to the music overhead.’"
425,CASTLE MARVEL.,"The others, hastening onward, reached, at length, the foot of the"
426,CASTLE MARVEL.,"mountain, and began to ascend. But to climb this mountain was by no means"
427,CASTLE MARVEL.,"an easy task; for, while in some places it was very steep, in others a"
428,CASTLE MARVEL.,perpendicular and seemingly impassable wall would confront the weary
429,CASTLE MARVEL.,"traveler; and there were chasms, too, which must be crossed; but over"
430,CASTLE MARVEL.,most of these bridges had been built; and where the way was steep and
431,CASTLE MARVEL.,slippery steps had been hewn among the rocks; and up the granite walls
432,CASTLE MARVEL.,places had been cut for hands and feet; and all this had been done by
433,CASTLE MARVEL.,"travelers who had previously ascended—aye, with untold hardships, and"
434,CASTLE MARVEL.,"often at the risk of their lives. But now, in climbing, so had the way"
435,CASTLE MARVEL.,"been opened before them, these youths met with no peril, only with labor"
436,CASTLE MARVEL.,"and weariness, here and there. And yet, ever, as they toiled upward,"
437,CASTLE MARVEL.,"would one and another turn back, discouraged, to rejoin the comrades"
438,CASTLE MARVEL.,"below, declaring that the sight of the castle was not worth so much pains."
439,CASTLE MARVEL.,
440,CASTLE MARVEL.,“Now to these pleasure-seekers in the flowery meadows after a time
441,CASTLE MARVEL.,"returned the venturesome few who had succeeded in gaining the summit, and"
442,CASTLE MARVEL.,"they were greeted with loud cries of astonishment—for behold, their faces"
443,CASTLE MARVEL.,"shone wondrously, flooded as if with light, and they seemed like beings"
444,CASTLE MARVEL.,from another world.
445,CASTLE MARVEL.,
446,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“‘Tell us, what have you seen, or what have you heard, that your"

452,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“‘Ah, friends,’ replied the others, ‘would that we might tell you"
453,CASTLE MARVEL.,"the half of what we have seen, the half of what we have heard. Truly"
454,CASTLE MARVEL.,"marvelous is this castle which we have visited, and beyond the power of"
455,CASTLE MARVEL.,"words to describe. We may, indeed, relate to you how, from its windows,"
456,CASTLE MARVEL.,"we beheld the fair earth, from pole to pole, spread out before us in"
457,CASTLE MARVEL.,new and undreamed-of beauty; how we found secret stairways which led
458,CASTLE MARVEL.,"us to the burning heart of this same earth; how, through mysterious"
459,CASTLE MARVEL.,"passage-ways, we were guided to the silent and strangely-peopled valleys"
460,CASTLE MARVEL.,"of the sea; how, by tower and turret, we mounted to dizzy heights, from"
461,CASTLE MARVEL.,"whence we could peer in among the stars, and catch a glimpse of the glory"
462,CASTLE MARVEL.,"lying beyond; how all the way, from lowest foundation-stone to loftiest"
463,CASTLE MARVEL.,"pinnacle, they who went up before us had carved inscriptions, revealing"
464,CASTLE MARVEL.,"in what manner the world has fared—even from its creation; how, passing"
465,CASTLE MARVEL.,"to and fro, our questions were answered, our doubts were quieted, and"
466,CASTLE MARVEL.,we were filled with such delight as is only known to them who go up
467,CASTLE MARVEL.,"thither—this much, and more we may relate, and yet but a faint idea"
468,CASTLE MARVEL.,"will you have of that mighty structure. Oh, friends, so vast it is, so"
469,CASTLE MARVEL.,"wide, so high,—so deep down extend its massive walls, that, though one"
470,CASTLE MARVEL.,"should wander a lifetime within its gates, still many portions would be"
471,CASTLE MARVEL.,"unknown to him; so free and open to all it is, that whoever will may"
472,CASTLE MARVEL.,"abide there, continually feasted and royally entertained; so magnificent"
473,CASTLE MARVEL.,"it is, that whether you go up or down, whether you follow corridors that"
474,CASTLE MARVEL.,"lead on, and ever on, or loiter in spacious treasure-halls, golden is the"
475,CASTLE MARVEL.,"ceiling, crystal is the pavement, riches and splendor meet you at every"
476,CASTLE MARVEL.,"turn, and you tread upon diamonds which are yours but for the picking up;"
477,CASTLE MARVEL.,and what is most marvelous about the castle is this—the more of these
478,CASTLE MARVEL.,"rare jewels that are gathered and carried away, the more remain.’"
479,CASTLE MARVEL.,
480,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“Then the idlers, seeing their companions laden with precious gems,"
481,CASTLE MARVEL.,"sparkling in the sunlight, could not doubt the truthfulness of this"
482,CASTLE MARVEL.,"report; and they said: ‘Let us go up also, to be enriched, and to see"
483,CASTLE MARVEL.,those wonderful sights.’ But when they began to climb they discovered
484,CASTLE MARVEL.,"that their strength had departed, and that their eyes were dimmed so that"
485,CASTLE MARVEL.,they could not find the path; and they now first became aware of how the
486,CASTLE MARVEL.,"years had flown while they had been lingering among the pleasant fields,"
487,CASTLE MARVEL.,and that in the feebleness of age they were no longer able to mount
488,CASTLE MARVEL.,"upward. And they sat down and wept with regret, and nevermore ceased"
489,CASTLE MARVEL.,"sighing, because of the years they had wasted below.”"

491,CASTLE MARVEL.,"“There’s a _Hæc fabula docet_ to that story, I suspect,” said Harry,"

503,A MAY MORNING.,"so warm, and the air so soft and balmy, who can choose to stay indoors?"
504,A MAY MORNING.,"The Lieutenant draws his chair out to the porch, and is presently joined"

507,A MAY MORNING.,
508,A MAY MORNING.,"“You see we were out on the lake, fishing—a lot of us, and we’d caught"

510,A MAY MORNING.,"out we went into the water. Rain pouring down in torrents, and so dark"
511,A MAY MORNING.,you couldn’t see your hand before you. Tell you we had to swim for it.
512,A MAY MORNING.,"But we got ashore at last, and they took us in at a house close by, and"

515,A MAY MORNING.,

530,A MAY MORNING.,won’t you? You look tired. Professor cross this morning?”
531,A MAY MORNING.,
532,A MAY MORNING.,"“Yes,” responds Marie, readily accepting the invitation. “He says I don’t"

544,A MAY MORNING.,though he had seen them before now—passing notes to each other in that
545,A MAY MORNING.,"“horrid old school-room,” when “Old Williams” wasn’t watching."
546,A MAY MORNING.,
547,A MAY MORNING.,"But hush, you, Sir Robin, and hush, every one. Marie lifts her hand to"

596,BOB.,"“Behold me, all ye puny ones, behold me!"
597,BOB.,Look at my shoulders reaching to the sky!
598,BOB.,Look at my tasseled mantle—green forever!
599,BOB.,How can ye doubt or question?—here am I!”
600,BOB.,
601,BOB.,"A stately elm tree upward gazed a moment,"

603,BOB.,"“Aye, thou art tall and gayly decked, my brother,"

605,BOB.,
606,BOB.,"A languid willow, musing, softly murmured:"

609,BOB.,You must admit that gracefulness is mine.”

611,BOB.,"“Ah, well, that’s not the point,” replied a maple;"

616,BOB.,“Hold!” cried a tulip tree; “am I not shapely?
617,BOB.,And illy would the pine tree’s tassels green

640,BOB.,
641,BOB.,"A downy robe the knotted limbs enveloped,"

689,BOB.,"strings of his instrument, bringing forth many a plaintive air. Soon"
690,BOB.,"the music ceases, and the tattered hat is passed around. But he may not"
691,BOB.,"go yet; his audience is clamoring for a song. “An Italian song,” cries"
692,BOB.,"Marie. And so, to the accompaniment of his guitar, he sings in his native"
693,BOB.,tongue a little ballad which runs something after this fashion:
694,BOB.,
695,BOB.,"Wandering, wandering all the world over,"
696,BOB.,"Hither and thither, and to and fro,"
697,BOB.,"Free as the wind—the rollicking rover,"
698,BOB.,Lightly humming and thrumming I go.
699,BOB.,
700,BOB.,"Free as the wind to linger and tarry,"
701,BOB.,"Free as the wind to hasten afar,"
702,BOB.,All my wealth in my hands I carry—
703,BOB.,"Look, behold it—my gay guitar!"
704,BOB.,
705,BOB.,"Gold and houses and lands encumber,"
706,BOB.,"Never king, in his palace high,"
707,BOB.,"Slumber’d as sweetly as I slumber,"
708,BOB.,"Under the clear, unclouded sky."
709,BOB.,
710,BOB.,"Free as the wind, the rollicking rover,"
711,BOB.,"Little of trouble or care I know,"
712,BOB.,"Wandering, wandering all the world over,"
713,BOB.,"Hither and thither, and to and fro."
714,BOB.,
715,BOB.,"And off he goes with his merry song, and his weary smile, and his pockets"
716,BOB.,"jingling with pennies; and is succeeded by a fair-haired Norwegian, with"
717,BOB.,"a basket on his head, crying, “Oranges, oranges!”"
718,BOB.,
719,BOB.,"Harry rushes down, and buys him out of the stock in hand, and before any"
720,BOB.,"one has time to protest, begins to treat the assembled company. So it was"
721,BOB.,"for this feast that the round, golden fruit has been, all these months,"
722,BOB.,basking and ripening and gathering fragrance and sweetness from the rays
723,BOB.,that gladden a land of perpetual summer.
724,BOB.,
725,BOB.,"“What’s this—a picnic?” asks a gentleman in uniform, who has come to"
726,BOB.,call upon the Lieutenant. The youngsters follow with their eyes the blue
727,BOB.,"coat and bright buttons disappearing through the open doorway, then they"
728,BOB.,"slowly disperse; and Ponto, the great shaggy Newfoundlander, is left"
729,BOB.,"alone, dozing upon the mat. And the wee, gray sparrow returns with a wisp"
730,BOB.,"of horse-hair, and commences to build her nest."
731,BOB.,
732,BOB.,
733,BOB.,
734,BOB.,
735,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.
736,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
737,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
738,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“There goes Patches!”
739,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
740,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Hallo, Patches!”"
741,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
742,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Sitting in the porch, in the twilight of a June afternoon, Kate overhears"
743,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"those cruel taunts. “Oh-h-h!” she exclaims in smothered indignation, the"
744,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,hot flush mounting up her forehead.
745,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
746,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“What is it, sister?” asks the Lieutenant."
747,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
748,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Oh, Walter, there are some boys down there in the street, calling names"
749,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"at a little newsboy, and making sport of his poor, patched clothes. And"
750,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"he looks so downhearted and discouraged—poor little fellow! Oh, it’s"
751,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,_too_ bad! I wish you could say something to him to comfort him. Mrs.
752,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,McAllister was telling me about them the other day. His mother is a
753,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"widow and does washings, and there are other children—he the eldest; and"
754,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"he is so kind and thoughtful, and does everything he can to help her;"
755,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"goes around town, out of school-hours, running on errands and carrying"
756,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,newspapers. I know what I’ll do”—but her plan for a new suit of clothes
757,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"is suddenly broken in upon by the boy approaching, and handing her the"
758,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"evening paper, damp, just from the press."
759,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
760,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“How many more of those have you to deliver?” Walter inquires.
761,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
762,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“Only about a dozen.”
763,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
764,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Well, when you get through, and if you are not otherwise engaged, I’d"
765,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"like to have your company for a walk. You see,” he adds, with a smile,"
766,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“I haven’t any eyes, myself, to find the way with; and it’s such a fine"
767,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"evening I believe I’d like to go—yes, as far as the Park.”"
768,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
769,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"The boy looks up into the blind man’s face, Kate thinks, as if he would"
770,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,be willing to go to the ends of the earth with him.
771,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
772,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Yes, sir, I’ll be back in a few minutes,” he says, hurrying away."
773,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
774,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"In one corner of the Park there is a shady, secluded nook—a clump of"
775,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"trees all overgrown with vines, with rustic seats underneath. As Walter"
776,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and his companion rest there after their long walk, the moonbeams"
777,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"shining softly down between the leaves, all at once a sob breaks the"
778,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"stillness, followed by another and another, and then they come thick and"
779,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"fast. Now the Lieutenant does not ask, “What’s the matter, little boy?”"
780,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,as a great many thoughtless people would; for he remembers very well
781,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,that one doesn’t like to be asked such questions when one is crying.
782,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Besides, doesn’t he know what the matter is? He can picture to himself"
783,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"the wearisome life the poor child leads—ill-fed, ill-sheltered, ill-clad,"
784,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"half the year pinched with hunger and cold, half the year breathing the"
785,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"close, pent-up air of some wretched tenement—in his brave struggle to"
786,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"help his widowed mother, not always able to find work; knocked about by"
787,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"ruffian newsboys, sneered at by thoughtless schoolmates, little heeded"
788,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"or noticed by anybody; till he looks downhearted, as Kate says, and the"
789,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,very tones of his voice are grown dreary and sorrowful. Thinking of all
790,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"this, the Lieutenant cannot sit there like a block of stone, and listen"
791,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"to those stifled sobs. So, as there is nothing to be said, he leans over,"
792,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and with that one arm of his about the slight figure, draws it close to"
793,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,his side.
794,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
795,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Oh, you’re so good!” murmurs the tearful voice, as the lad rests his"
796,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,head against the friendly shoulder. “It’s that that makes such a baby
797,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,of me. I can’t help it. Other folks ain’t like that. Other folks don’t
798,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,talk to me pleasant about this and that as you did all the way. Other
799,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,folks—oh!” and with that the slender form is shaken again with sobs.
800,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
801,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Ah, but those other folks who treat you so, you are going to make them"
802,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"sorry for it, some day.”"
803,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
804,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“How?” The dreary young voice is full of wonder.
805,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
806,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“How? Let me tell you a little story. Years ago a young printer went to
807,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"New York City to find work. He hadn’t any fine clothes, and scarcely any"
808,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"money, and I doubt if in all that great city there was a single person"
809,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,that he knew. After much searching he found something to do; and in the
810,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,office where he was employed the other printers delighted in annoying
811,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"him, playing jokes upon him, and daubing his light-colored hair with"
812,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,ink. I wouldn’t wonder if this sort of treatment made him feel sad and
813,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"homesick, sometimes, and wish he was back again among the mountains"
814,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"where he came from. However, he paid little attention to it; he worked"
815,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"all day, faithfully, and at night he read and studied a good deal; and"
816,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"when he couldn’t afford to pay for a light to study by, he would take"
817,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,his book out by the street-lamp and study there—sometimes when it was
818,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"cold, too. Wasn’t he persevering? Well, he worked, and read, and studied,"
819,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and persevered, till he got to be an editor; yes, in time he became the"
820,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"most famous editor—or journalist, some would call it—the most famous one"
821,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"that ever lived. Last fall he died—this man who was once a penniless,"
822,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,friendless boy—and at the news of his death there was sadness all over
823,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"the country; and, at his burial, thousands and thousands of people"
824,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"crowded those same streets where he used to read, shivering, by the"
825,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,lamp-light; thousands and thousands went to get a glimpse of his dead
826,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"face, and wept over it, because he had helped them and they loved him and"
827,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,were sorry he was gone.
828,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
829,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Oh, was it Horace Greeley?” the lad whispers. (He has stopped crying"
830,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,now.)
831,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
832,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“You have guessed.”
833,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
834,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“I’ve thought, sometimes,” says the boy, presently, in a hesitating"
835,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,way—“I never told it to anybody before—but I’ve thought I’d like to be
836,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"great, too, some time, to be a lawyer—and—and go to Congress—and—oh,"
837,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"I never told it to anybody before, because it’s foolish, I know, and"
838,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"they’d laugh at me. I can’t help thinking about it, though. But of course"
839,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,there’s no hope for _me_.”
840,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
841,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Ah, but there _is_, though! I doubt if our Vice-President thought there"
842,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"was much hope of his ever going to Congress when, in his youth, he was"
843,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"earning his livelihood in a shoemaker’s shop. But, you see, he kept"
844,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"pegging away; when it wasn’t at boots and shoes it was at books, at"
845,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"gaining knowledge, and making the most of the talents that were given"
846,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"him, working his way up, inch by inch, till he became congressman,"
847,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"surely, till now he presides over the Senate. And our President, at"
848,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"your age, little dreamed that he would ever be called upon to control a"
849,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"great army, to plan campaigns and sieges, to ‘fight it out all summer on"
850,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"this line,’ as you have heard about—persevering, you see—and so to put"
851,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"an end to the bloody war, and be chosen once and again to the highest"
852,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"office in the land—like Washington, long ago. Yes, it’s perseverance that"
853,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"does it. Did you ever hear of Cyrus Field, the man who brought the Old"
854,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,World and the New nearer together by his Atlantic cable? When he first
855,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"proposed to do it, to send dispatches through two thousand miles of"
856,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"water, that seemed to every one a very absurd idea. But when his cable"
857,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"was finished and ready to be laid, then people began to be interested;"
858,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"indeed, they were really excited over it, and it was quite the fashion"
859,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"to wear attached to one’s watch-chain a bit of that gutta-percha cable,"
860,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"set in gold. But the cable, or telegraph, was a failure, after all; it"
861,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"didn’t ‘work.’ So people disbelieved once more, and lost interest in the"
862,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"enterprise, and took the bits of gutta-percha from their watch-chains,"
863,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,and put them away out of sight and of mind. And it fared with the
864,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"experimenter just as it fared with those trinkets. But years passed by,"
865,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and lo! one day, to everybody’s surprise, the President received from"
866,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,Queen Victoria a polite message that had taken but a few moments to cross
867,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"the wide Atlantic. And now, you know, Europe and America can talk with"
868,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"each other almost as easily as you and I here, sitting side by side."
869,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,For what had Cyrus Field been doing all that time that nobody took any
870,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"notice of him? He had been making trial after trial, and failure after"
871,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"failure, and losing fortune, and, very likely, friends, but never losing"
872,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"hope. So he persevered—and succeeded, at last. And who does your history"
873,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,say discovered America?”
874,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
875,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“Christopher Columbus.”
876,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
877,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Well, this Christopher Columbus of whom all the histories tell and"
878,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"everybody knows, he was only a sailor boy, once, roving about in the"
879,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Mediterranean, with small chance of ever becoming noted. As little chance"
880,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"would it seem there was when, years later, he went from court to court,"
881,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"vainly asking aid to carry out his project. People had hardly begun, yet,"
882,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"to credit the notion that the world was round; and this tall, sad-eyed,"
883,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"white-haired, shabbily dressed stranger, with his maps and his charts,"
884,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and his plans for sailing straight West to India, who was going to"
885,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,listen to him? Kings and queens were unwilling to see him or give him an
886,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"opportunity to explain, courtiers ridiculed him, children in the street"
887,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"would point to their foreheads, as he passed by, and call out to each"
888,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"other, ‘Look at the crazy Italian!’ But often disappointed, always hoping"
889,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"and persevering, he stuck to his project, and finally, after eighteen"
890,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"long years of waiting and fruitless effort, he got the help he wanted and"
891,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"started on his voyage, and so found—not India, but America.”"
892,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
893,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,And as the Lieutenant and his young guide walk slowly homeward through
894,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"the silent, moonlit avenues, he speaks of Lincoln, of Herder, of"
895,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Ferguson, of Beethoven, of Sir William Herschel, and of others who have"
896,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,risen from poverty and obscurity to honor and renown; many of them
897,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“self-made,” as it is called, toiling patiently and unaided up that steep"
898,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,hill where the laurels grow.
899,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
900,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,Kate hears the hopeful ring in the lad’s voice as he says “Good night” to
901,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"his friend, and through the open window she sees the hopeful expression"
902,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"upon his face as he turns away, glancing down rather proudly at the"
903,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"jacket that is mended with pieces of many shades, and the boots that have"
904,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"been patched and patched again. “What can you have been saying to him,"
905,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Walter?” she wonders. “Oh, if you could only have seen his face just now!"
906,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,He doesn’t look like the same boy.” And Walter musingly repeats those
907,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,lines with which every “wide-awake” American boy and girl is familiar.
908,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,For was it not Longfellow who wrote them?
909,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
910,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,“Lives of great men all remind us
911,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"We may make our lives sublime,"
912,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"And, departing, leave behind us"
913,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,Footprints on the sands of time;
914,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
915,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"“Footprints that perchance another,"
916,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,"
917,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Some forlorn and shipwrecked brother,"
918,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"Seeing, shall take heart again.”"
919,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
920,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"When, just before breakfast, Kate opens the door to look for the morning"
921,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"paper, what does she find lying there on the threshold beside it? Fresh"
922,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,water-lilies—the like of which are not to be found nearer than the
923,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"lake—miles away. “He has been all that way and back, this morning! bless"
924,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"his little heart!” she exclaims, in astonishment, as she carries them"
925,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,"to her brother, breathing a thousand sweetest “Thank-you’s,” from among"
926,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,their snowy petals. And you may be sure that those patched garments will
927,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,soon be replaced by others nice and new.
928,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,
929,PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.,

932,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.
933,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
934,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
935,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“I’d like to know,” exclaims Marie, “if there weren’t any heroines as"
936,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,well as heroes in the time of the Revolution. Now down there in the Park
937,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"to-day, while they were having their orations, and Mr. Higby got to"
938,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,talking about the Revolution—”
939,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
940,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Come now,” breaks in Harry, “you don’t mean to pretend you heard a word"
941,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,he said!”
942,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
943,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Indeed I do! I listened first-rate—along at first. Katy, mustn’t he"
944,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"stop interrupting? Well, all I was going to say was, that when he got to"
945,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,talking about the Revolution it was all about the forefathers that he got
946,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"so eloquent, and never a word about the mothers! As if _they_ weren’t"
947,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"patriotic, too, and of some account! Don’t you suppose they were?”"
948,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
949,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Kate,” slyly observes her brother, “here’s another fine opportunity for"
950,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,you to hold forth on the subject of your great-great-grandmother.”
951,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
952,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“Ah! just as though you weren’t every whit as proud of her as I am!”
953,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
954,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Oh, my! _did_ you have a great-great-grandmother?” cries the"
955,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,enthusiastic Marie. “Do tell us about her.”
956,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
957,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Yes, do, Miss Katy,” says Harry, seconding the motion as he watches a"
958,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"sky-rocket shooting upward, leaving a gleaming train as it curves through"
959,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"the air. For this is the evening of the “Glorious Fourth,” and the"
960,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"speakers are all out in the porch, where a good view can be had of the"
961,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,display of fireworks down at the corner of the street.
962,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
963,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Well, then, Harry, you know about the battle of Cowpens, in South"
964,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,Carolina?”
965,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
966,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Yes, where the British thought they had won the day, sure, and Morgan"
967,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"brought up his dragoons, and they cut and slashed right and left, and put"
968,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"the Redcoats to flight, and took a lot of prisoners.”"
969,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
970,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“What are dragoons?” inquires Marie.
971,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
972,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Mounted troops—cavalry. Oh, but didn’t they pitch into ’em good with"
973,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,their swords! Wish _I’d_ been there.”
974,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
975,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“And then you know, Harry, how Cornwallis pursued Morgan, in hopes of"
976,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,recovering the prisoners; and how General Greene had to come to Morgan’s
977,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"rescue. By the way, Walter, I don’t know exactly why, but somehow all I"
978,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,hear of Sherman in the last war reminds me of that General Greene.”
979,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
980,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“And did your great-great-grandmother live around there anywheres?”
981,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
982,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Yes, Marie. But you mustn’t think of her as a grandmother at all, with"
983,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,gray hair and cap and spectacles; for she was only a young girl then.
984,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,There’s a portrait of her painted a few years after. They have it at
985,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"Uncle Robert’s—little Rob’s father, you know. There she sits, with her"
986,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"arms folded; and she wears a brocade silk, with much lace about the low"
987,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,neck and flowing sleeves; and her hair is combed straight up from the
988,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"forehead over a roll, and coiled high at the back of the head, very much"
989,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"as the style is now—only I suppose it was all her own, for switches"
990,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,hadn’t yet been thought of.”
991,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
992,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“And did she do something brave?”
993,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
994,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“So the story goes. She was an orphan, you see, and lived with her uncle,"
995,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"who was a hot-tempered old Tory, and all his sons and daughters the same."
996,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"But, perhaps because they weren’t as good to her as they might have been,"
997,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,she took it into her head to believe some other way—sympathized with the
998,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"rebels, you know. But she took care not to let any one find that out,"
999,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"which no one was likely to, for she was so young, only sixteen—just two"
1000,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"years older than you, Marie—people wouldn’t be questioning her about"
1001,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"politics. Well, it was just at this time, when Cornwallis was chasing"
1002,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"up Morgan, that there came one rainy evening to her uncle’s a small"
1003,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"detachment of British troops, with some Americans belonging to Morgan’s"
1004,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"force whom they had captured the day previous, and asked for lodgings for"
1005,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"the night. Her uncle welcomed them heartily, and gave them a room where"
1006,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"they could lock up their prisoners, and ordered Chloe, the black cook, to"
1007,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,get up a grand supper for them. Grand? I don’t suppose it was what would
1008,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,be called a grand supper nowadays. I presume it consisted largely of game
1009,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"from the forest, venison, and the like—not much in the way of dessert and"
1010,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"nick-nacks, you know. While the British were feasting in the dining-room,"
1011,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"Kate—we may as well call her Kate, for I forgot to tell you that I was"
1012,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"named after her—slipped into the kitchen, and managed, unseen, to fill a"
1013,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"basket with some of that plentiful supper, and creep with it up a back"
1014,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,stairway to the store-room or garret at the top of the house. Now the
1015,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"room where the prisoners were locked in was in the second story, and had"
1016,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,no window; but in the ceiling there was a trap-door that opened into the
1017,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"garret. Kate raised this door—or rather, it was a mere piece of plank—and"
1018,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"let down the basket by a rope. And the prisoners, looking up and catching"
1019,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"sight of her friendly face by the light of the candle she held, were"
1020,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"gladdened, you may be sure. Ah, poor fellows, and they were hungry, too;"
1021,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"hadn’t had a mouthful for two days. (Indeed, they had been out in search"
1022,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,of game. That was the way they happened to be caught.) ‘Was there any
1023,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,way under the sun for them to get out of there?’ they asked her. Yes;
1024,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"she told them of a way she had thought of, but they would have to be"
1025,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"very still about it, and wait till everybody in the house had gone to"
1026,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"sleep. Then she closed the door again, but she was careful to take the"
1027,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"basket with her, lest the Red-coats might look in before retiring, and"
1028,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"find it there and suspect something was wrong. They did look in, too."
1029,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"There were the prisoners, all secure. Then they locked and bolted the"
1030,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"door again, and for further security stationed a guard outside. When"
1031,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,Kate found out about the guard she trembled for her plans. But toward
1032,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"midnight she peeped into the hall and saw him nodding sleepily, for he"
1033,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"and his comrades, as well as their officers, had been making free with"
1034,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,her uncle’s wine. In those days it was the custom to keep quantities of
1035,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"wine even in private houses, and to use it freely at the table.”"
1036,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1037,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,[Illustration: But in the ceiling there was a trap-door that opened into
1038,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,the garret.—PAGE 38.]
1039,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1040,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“Nothing of that sort going on nowadays!”
1041,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1042,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“I am sorry to say so, Harry, but I suppose there is; though not so"
1043,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"generally the practice, I am sure—at least, not in this country. Well,"
1044,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"Kate crept up to the garret again, by the same way as before, and she"
1045,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"lowered a ladder—oh, so still!—to those six prisoners, and one by one"
1046,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"they climbed up softly through the little trap-door in the ceiling—oh,"
1047,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"it was just the least mite of an opening, hardly large enough for a"
1048,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,person to crawl through; but then I suppose that one could manage to
1049,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,squeeze through a pretty small space for the sake of regaining one’s
1050,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,liberty—”
1051,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1052,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“That’s so!” says Harry, speaking, doubtless, from experience."
1053,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1054,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Now, you mustn’t interrupt again!” says Marie; “just when they’re all"
1055,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"climbing up, too; and I’m so afraid that sentinel there in the hall"
1056,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"outside will hear! But, oh, Katy, when they’re all up in the garret how"
1057,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,ever is she going to get them away from there? Won’t somebody wake up and
1058,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,hear while she’s getting them all down that back stairway?”
1059,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1060,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“No, they didn’t go down that way. You see this garret was used for a"
1061,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"store-room for flour and groceries, and the like; for the place was so"
1062,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"far from any mill or market, that when they sent to the nearest town"
1063,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"they used to purchase all those things in large quantities. So, for"
1064,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"convenience in storing away articles, a stairway had been built up"
1065,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,against the outside of the house.”
1066,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1067,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Oh, and there was an outside door to the garret! What a dear, delicious"
1068,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"old house, with stairways and trap-doors, and everything all fixed just"
1069,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,right to help those poor prisoners off!”
1070,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1071,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Now, you mustn’t interrupt again!” says a mocking voice."
1072,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1073,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Down they went, under the dripping eaves; but when they reached the"
1074,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"ground and held a whispered consultation, it came out that they hadn’t"
1075,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,the slightest idea in which direction to go to join their commander;
1076,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"for they were all from the north, and perfectly unacquainted with the"
1077,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,country. ‘Could the kind young lady give them some directions?’ ‘I will
1078,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"go as guide,’ she said. So they helped themselves to the six chargers"
1079,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"of the six British officers sleeping snugly under her uncle’s roof, and"
1080,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"she mounted her little sorrel pony, and away they went, through the rain"
1081,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"and the darkness—slowly at first, lest the trampling of the horses’ feet"
1082,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"should be heard, which likely would have been the case but for the ground"
1083,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,being softened by the rain; after that they dashed along swiftly over
1084,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"hills and through forests, for it was a wild, uncultivated region through"
1085,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,which their route lay. After riding a few miles they reached a rapid
1086,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"stream, so swollen by the freshets which prevailed just then—it was in"
1087,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"January—so deep and rapid that it was almost impossible for the soldiers,"
1088,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"even on their stout war-horses, to ford it, for there was no bridge. Kate"
1089,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"and her little pony would surely have been swept away. So, as she could"
1090,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"go no farther, she told them as clearly as she could how they were to"
1091,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"turn to the right at such a cross-road, and to the left at another, and"
1092,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,to the right again when they came to a certain old church; and if they
1093,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"kept straight ahead when they came to a certain tall pine tree, standing"
1094,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"all alone by itself, they would reach the place where they expected to"
1095,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,find Morgan. (As he was on the move all the time they couldn’t be so sure
1096,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"about that.) So, with a ‘God bless you!’ from the leader, which all his"
1097,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"companions echoed, they plunged into the roaring torrent, and she turned"
1098,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"back through the forest—where there were fierce bears and panthers, mind"
1099,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,you; but fortunately the rain kept them in their dens that night.
1100,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1101,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“When she reached home, all was as dark and silent as when she left; and"
1102,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"when she peeped out again from her room, there was the guard nodding as"
1103,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"before; but not really asleep. He hadn’t heard a sound. Poor fellow, the"
1104,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,British Colonel and the rest were going to have him shot for sleeping
1105,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"at his post, when, next morning, they found the prisoners had gone and"
1106,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"the horses too. How furiously angry they were! But, oh, the uncle! his"
1107,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"eyes flashed lightnings, and his voice was like the thunder. Kate was"
1108,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"wakened by his raging and storming, with all the black people up before"
1109,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"him to be cross-questioned, and they declaring that ‘O massa, dey wouldn’"
1110,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"a-helped dem rebel trash away fur nuffin in de hull worl’!’ If they had,"
1111,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"their lives wouldn’t have been worth much. Kate knew that, or she might"
1112,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,have asked some of them to assist her. She meant to bear all the blame
1113,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,herself.”
1114,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1115,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Wasn’t she a trump, though!”"
1116,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1117,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Yes, Harry; but she trembled like a leaf all the time, dressing herself"
1118,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"in a hurry, and rushing out to confess before them all, and plead for"
1119,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"the sentinel’s life. ‘Oh, he wasn’t a bit to blame! he didn’t go to"
1120,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"sleep at all, for she looked to see! We were so still about it that, oh,"
1121,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"he couldn’t hear! and oh, don’t kill him, don’t!’ And then she almost"
1122,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,fainted away. But the angry old uncle was angrier than ever. He ordered
1123,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"her to her room, and never to show her face again. But just at this"
1124,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"point, when all is clamor and confusion, and the poor, pale, frightened"
1125,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"girl is being dragged off in disgrace to her chamber, the house is"
1126,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,suddenly surrounded by the combined forces of Greene and Morgan (for they
1127,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"met yesterday, and have been nearer by all the time than was supposed),"
1128,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"and led by the American Captain whom she released last night, in walks"
1129,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"General Greene himself, to thank her for her brave deed; and when she is"
1130,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"led to the window, all those soldiers—ragged, weak with hunger, as they"
1131,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"are, footsore and weary with continual marching—at the sight of her, just"
1132,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"toss up their hats (those of them who have any) and cheer, and cheer, and"
1133,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,cheer. And the British Colonel and his men are prisoners themselves in
1134,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,about two seconds—”
1135,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1136,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Oh, jolly!”"
1137,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1138,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“And the mad old Tory uncle’s wine-casks have to be tapped again, while"
1139,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,the rebel army there before his eyes drinks to his niece’s health.”
1140,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1141,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Jolly, jollier, jolliest!”"
1142,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1143,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“You might suppose there wasn’t enough to go around; but you must
1144,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"remember that it was not such a very big army. How large should you say,"
1145,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,Walter?”
1146,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1147,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“Probably not a larger number than would be included in two what in our
1148,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"last war were considered good-sized regiments. Hardly that, for I believe"
1149,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"Greene left quite a force behind at his post on the Pedee river, when"
1150,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,he pushed across country to join Morgan; and his whole command united
1151,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,couldn’t have amounted to more than two thousand.”
1152,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1153,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Just think of it! And that wee little army, half-starved and poorly"

1156,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1157,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,“But about Kate? Did that horrid old Tory of an uncle shut her up in her
1158,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,room after that?”
1159,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1160,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Take care, Miss Marie, that ‘horrid old Tory of an uncle’ was a distant"

1162,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1163,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Oh, I didn’t mean to say anything against your relations, Mr. Walter;"
1164,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"but then everybody knows you aren’t a bit like him, if you _are_ a tease!”"
1165,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1166,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“No,” Kate goes on, “they didn’t shut her up in her room, but she was"
1167,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"treated very coolly all around the board, and as for her uncle, I believe"
1168,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"he never spoke to her again. What made him particularly indignant was,"
1169,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,that the British prisoners would insist that he was at the bottom of
1170,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"it all, and had set the trap for them himself. They had reason to be"
1171,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"suspicious, for in that section one never could be certain who were"
1172,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"Tories and who were not, so many of the people wavered in their opinions,"
1173,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"favoring the royal cause one day and the rebels the next. Well, to wind"
1174,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"up my story, Kate was so unhappy there, that she went to live with an"
1175,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"aunt in Charleston till some two or three years after, when the war was"
1176,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"all over, and she married—”"
1177,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1178,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Oh, wait, let me guess who!—the American Captain, now, didn’t she? How"
1179,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,romantic! Then he was your great-great-grandfather!”
1180,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,
1181,KATE’S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.,"“Yes, and they came North, and lived and died right where Uncle Robert"

1234,IN THE WOODS.,
1235,IN THE WOODS.,"Kate looks up, too. Feathery-fine are those branches, swaying lazily in"

1258,IN THE WOODS.,"Just now, as if to give force to the remark, one of those jarring voices"
1259,IN THE WOODS.,"that make discord in the music of life, is overheard, saying:"
1260,IN THE WOODS.,
1261,IN THE WOODS.,"“Look at Bessie Barton, off there with Kate. I _do_ wish that child would"
1262,IN THE WOODS.,learn to hold her head up! If _I_ had the management of her I’d cure her
1263,IN THE WOODS.,of her bashfulness in short order!”
1264,IN THE WOODS.,
1265,IN THE WOODS.,Kate glances down. Has Bessie heard? No; her thoughts are ever so far
1266,IN THE WOODS.,away.
1267,IN THE WOODS.,
1268,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, Bessie,” says the other, quickly, lest there is more to come, “I"
1269,IN THE WOODS.,see some cardinal-flowers down there by the brook. Won’t you go bring me
1270,IN THE WOODS.,"some, please?”"
1271,IN THE WOODS.,
1272,IN THE WOODS.,"And as the child flies away on the errand, Kate joins the companions from"
1273,IN THE WOODS.,"whom they have strayed, and confronts the owner of the voice with—"
1274,IN THE WOODS.,
1275,IN THE WOODS.,“Now you shall not say anything against Bessie. She’s a little angel.”
1276,IN THE WOODS.,
1277,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, I wouldn’t have dared to say a word, Kate, if I had thought you were"
1278,IN THE WOODS.,"within earshot. She’s a particular pet of yours, I believe. But how you"
1279,IN THE WOODS.,"can find anything interesting in her, I can’t see. She’s plain, and so"
1280,IN THE WOODS.,shy and lackadaisical! I don’t see how she’s ever going to get through
1281,IN THE WOODS.,the world without a little more _vim_.”
1282,IN THE WOODS.,
1283,IN THE WOODS.,"“Ah, you’ll see. But as to her being plain, now I don’t think so. What"
1284,IN THE WOODS.,"rosy cheeks she has! and her eyes—why, they’re lovely. And she’s not"
1285,IN THE WOODS.,"what I should call lackadaisical, in the least. Why, she’s the busiest"
1286,IN THE WOODS.,little body alive! always doing something for somebody. And then she has
1287,IN THE WOODS.,talent—a wonderful eye for figure. I think she’s going to make an artist.”
1288,IN THE WOODS.,
1289,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, Kate!” laughs Aunt Sophia, “what remarkable people all your friends"
1290,IN THE WOODS.,"are, the younger ones especially. There’s that scapegrace of a boy, my"
1291,IN THE WOODS.,nephew Harry; what do you think of _him_? No doubt you’ll say he’s the
1292,IN THE WOODS.,"pink of propriety. Harry, Harry! come down out of that tree, this minute,"
1293,IN THE WOODS.,"and stop tearing about so, or you’ll be all in rags by night!”"
1294,IN THE WOODS.,
1295,IN THE WOODS.,“What do I think of him? I think he’s just magnificent!”
1296,IN THE WOODS.,
1297,IN THE WOODS.,“As black as the ace of spades.”
1298,IN THE WOODS.,
1299,IN THE WOODS.,"“Yes, he’s tanned up beautifully this summer, and so full of health and"
1300,IN THE WOODS.,"spirits, with a heart as big as all out-of-doors.”"
1301,IN THE WOODS.,
1302,IN THE WOODS.,“If he would only take to books more.”
1303,IN THE WOODS.,
1304,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, books are well enough (I wouldn’t, for the world, speak slightingly"
1305,IN THE WOODS.,of them); but books are not everything. Of what good is all the learning
1306,IN THE WOODS.,"if one hasn’t the life—the strength to put it to use? Ah, those"
1307,IN THE WOODS.,sinewy fists! they remind me of the old Greeks. Bless him!—the young
1308,IN THE WOODS.,Hercules!—when the work comes for him to do he is going to be strong and
1309,IN THE WOODS.,able to do it.”
1310,IN THE WOODS.,
1311,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, he has a mission to fulfill, then! What may it be, I wonder?"
1312,IN THE WOODS.,Lassoing wild horses on the pampas?”
1313,IN THE WOODS.,
1314,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, he’s going to do something splendid, by and by, that will make you"
1315,IN THE WOODS.,all proud of him.”
1316,IN THE WOODS.,
1317,IN THE WOODS.,"“Well, you _are_ encouraging. And there’s that little popinjay, Marie"
1318,IN THE WOODS.,"Maross, with her saucy eyes (by the way, I never could make out which"
1319,IN THE WOODS.,"they are, gray or black), and her _stringlets_—I can’t conscientiously"
1320,IN THE WOODS.,call them ringlets (I suppose they would have been _wavelets_ if she had
1321,IN THE WOODS.,only known over night she was coming)—and her white dress as limp as if
1322,IN THE WOODS.,it hadn’t come fresh from the laundry this very morning. Do look at the
1323,IN THE WOODS.,"grass-stains and mud on it, and half the ruffles on one side torn off!"
1324,IN THE WOODS.,(I don’t see how her mother has any kind of patience with her; but then
1325,IN THE WOODS.,"she’s an easy old shoe.) And her sash awry, and her ribbons flying, and"
1326,IN THE WOODS.,"her bracelets rattling, and those half-dozen strings of beads around her"
1327,IN THE WOODS.,neck—”
1328,IN THE WOODS.,
1329,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, not half-a-dozen!”"
1330,IN THE WOODS.,
1331,IN THE WOODS.,"“At any rate, enough to be always jingling wherever she goes, like the"
1332,IN THE WOODS.,old woman in the nursery rhyme:
1333,IN THE WOODS.,
1334,IN THE WOODS.,‘With a ring on her finger and a bell on her toe.’
1335,IN THE WOODS.,
1336,IN THE WOODS.,"Well, how are you going to dispose of _her_? Is she to be a second—a sort"
1337,IN THE WOODS.,"of feminine Rubenstein, or a Pauline Lucca—or are you going to send her"
1338,IN THE WOODS.,as missionary to the Feejee Islands?”
1339,IN THE WOODS.,
1340,IN THE WOODS.,"“I’m sure the cannibals would not have the heart to eat her up,” Kate"
1341,IN THE WOODS.,"answers, laughingly. “The gay little thing! I like to watch her, over"
1342,IN THE WOODS.,"there in the garden, fluttering about among the flowers, prattling"
1343,IN THE WOODS.,"to her grandfather, keeping him company. I always think of the"
1344,IN THE WOODS.,"butterflies—harmless, pretty little creatures, meant, it would seem,"
1345,IN THE WOODS.,"only to rollick in the sunbeams and enjoy themselves, and brighten the"
1346,IN THE WOODS.,landscape.”
1347,IN THE WOODS.,
1348,IN THE WOODS.,"“But her everlasting chatter! If, instead of living opposite, you were"
1349,IN THE WOODS.,"right next door to them, as we are, I’m sure _you_ would tire of it"
1350,IN THE WOODS.,"sometimes,—especially in summer, when the doors and windows are all"
1351,IN THE WOODS.,"open. Oh, I assure you, her tongue is going from morning till night. It"
1352,IN THE WOODS.,"fairly drives me wild, sometimes.”"
1353,IN THE WOODS.,
1354,IN THE WOODS.,“But with all her prattle one hardly ever hears her say anything really
1355,IN THE WOODS.,ill-natured.”
1356,IN THE WOODS.,
1357,IN THE WOODS.,“And it’s just as uncommon to hear her say anything with any sense to it!”
1358,IN THE WOODS.,
1359,IN THE WOODS.,"“Well, _somebody_ must do the chattering. If none of us ever spoke but"
1360,IN THE WOODS.,"to say something sensible, what a fearfully hushed, melancholy sort of"
1361,IN THE WOODS.,"world this would be. That little brook purling among the stones, there"
1362,IN THE WOODS.,"seems to be no meaning in what it says, yet Mother Nature doesn’t bid it"
1363,IN THE WOODS.,"keep quiet; and if all these little birds should stop singing, though"
1364,IN THE WOODS.,"we can detect but little sense in their merry songs, how we should miss"
1365,IN THE WOODS.,"the music!—There!” Kate pauses, alarmed at her own boldness, for it is"
1366,IN THE WOODS.,like treading on matches to argue with Aunt Sophia! “I didn’t mean to
1367,IN THE WOODS.,speechify; I beg your pardon.”
1368,IN THE WOODS.,
1369,IN THE WOODS.,"“Ah, well, you and I never will agree. And here comes your angelic"
1370,IN THE WOODS.,"protégée.” Namely, Bessie, just now approaching with Monsieur Maross, who"
1371,IN THE WOODS.,has been helping her gather the cardinal-flowers.
1372,IN THE WOODS.,
1373,IN THE WOODS.,"Did you over see any of those, lads and lasses? There is no color richer"
1374,IN THE WOODS.,"or more beautiful than the deep, glowing scarlet of their corollas. It is"
1375,IN THE WOODS.,this which gives them the name.
1376,IN THE WOODS.,
1377,IN THE WOODS.,"“Figure to yourselves,” says M. Maross, who is a naturalist and a"
1378,IN THE WOODS.,"foreigner, as you perceive, “figure to yourselves some missionary priest"
1379,IN THE WOODS.,"of the early days, as he journeys through the wilderness from one Indian"
1380,IN THE WOODS.,village to another. Passing some moist and shady nook he first spies
1381,IN THE WOODS.,this superb blossom. He admires it. Instantly he is reminded of _les
1382,IN THE WOODS.,"chapeaux rouges_.[1] Behold, _lobelia cardinalis_ is no longer at loss"
1383,IN THE WOODS.,for a title.” Monsieur also goes on to state that the flower alluded
1384,IN THE WOODS.,"to—“Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow”—was of this rich,"
1385,IN THE WOODS.,vivid color. Whereupon the listeners exclaim in surprise. They had
1386,IN THE WOODS.,supposed it was white.
1387,IN THE WOODS.,
1388,IN THE WOODS.,"“Yes, that is the general impression, but erroneous. I have myself seen"
1389,IN THE WOODS.,the flower growing in that country. Had it been of white the concluding
1390,IN THE WOODS.,words would not have been so peculiarly applicable: ‘Even Solomon in all
1391,IN THE WOODS.,his glory was not arrayed like one of these.’ _Comprenez?_”
1392,IN THE WOODS.,
1393,IN THE WOODS.,"“Ah, yes; I see. If we only knew more about the East how many of those"
1394,IN THE WOODS.,passages would gain in force and clearness that now one somehow cannot
1395,IN THE WOODS.,get at the pith of.”
1396,IN THE WOODS.,
1397,IN THE WOODS.,"“You speak truly, Mees.”"
1398,IN THE WOODS.,
1399,IN THE WOODS.,"Presently, under some spreading beeches, the friends and neighbors who"
1400,IN THE WOODS.,"have come to these woods, as is their wont in sultry weather, for a"
1401,IN THE WOODS.,"few hours of recreation, gather together for luncheon—without ceremony"
1402,IN THE WOODS.,"of table or table-cloth, for this is “no stiff affair,” as some one"
1403,IN THE WOODS.,"complacently remarks, but quite “all in the familee,” as Harry says,"
1404,IN THE WOODS.,bringing forth from its hiding-place an unexpected treat. And now
1405,IN THE WOODS.,everybody understands why so little has been seen of him to-day. Doesn’t
1406,IN THE WOODS.,he know these miles of woodland by heart? Is there any tree so tall he
1407,IN THE WOODS.,"hasn’t climbed it, or any stream so small he hasn’t traced it to its"
1408,IN THE WOODS.,"source? He can show you all the crows’ nests and all the rabbit burrows,"
1409,IN THE WOODS.,and even hint to you mysteriously that a fox dwells hereabout. He knows
1410,IN THE WOODS.,"the banks where the strawberries reddened in June, and the hill-sides"
1411,IN THE WOODS.,"where the chestnuts will burst their burs in October, and it is only he"
1412,IN THE WOODS.,"who could surprise the company with this heaping basket of blackberries,"
1413,IN THE WOODS.,"so fresh and ripe and luscious, still wet with last night’s dew."
1414,IN THE WOODS.,
1415,IN THE WOODS.,"“Hal, you’re a brick!” exclaims a youth of his own age, piling his plate"
1416,IN THE WOODS.,with the proffered fruit.
1417,IN THE WOODS.,
1418,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oo is weal dood, Hawy, I lite oo!” lisps the infantile voice of Maggie"
1419,IN THE WOODS.,"McAllister, two wee, dimpled fists making a successful dive into the"
1420,IN THE WOODS.,basket.
1421,IN THE WOODS.,
1422,IN THE WOODS.,“You ah the light of me eyes and the joy of me haaht!” murmurs a recent
1423,IN THE WOODS.,"graduate from a boarding-school, languidly inserting a dessert-spoon the"
1424,IN THE WOODS.,"while she regards this young man—not yet far advanced in his teens, to be"
1425,IN THE WOODS.,"sure—as benignly as if he were about the size of Maggie, there."
1426,IN THE WOODS.,
1427,IN THE WOODS.,"“Let ’em help themselves,” he mutters in disgust, setting down the basket"
1428,IN THE WOODS.,"directly, and joining Marie where she is seated at the foot of a tree. “I"
1429,IN THE WOODS.,can stand half a day in a swamp and poke amongst blackberry briers till
1430,IN THE WOODS.,"my hands resemble the map of Germany done in red chalk, but I can’t go"
1431,IN THE WOODS.,that sort of thing. Let’s wish.”
1432,IN THE WOODS.,
1433,IN THE WOODS.,Master Harry has not been many seconds in divesting of its edible
1434,IN THE WOODS.,surroundings that part of the fowl which is known to all as the
1435,IN THE WOODS.,"“wish-bone,” and which the slender fingers of the “popinjay” always"
1436,IN THE WOODS.,manage to break in her favor.
1437,IN THE WOODS.,
1438,IN THE WOODS.,"“Say, now, what did you wish? (You have to tell, you know.) That there"
1439,IN THE WOODS.,"would be another war or revolution right off, so you could have a chance"
1440,IN THE WOODS.,to show your courage?”
1441,IN THE WOODS.,
1442,IN THE WOODS.,“Now you needn’t make any more fun of my courage. But I don’t care if you
1443,IN THE WOODS.,do think I’m a coward. I belong to somebody that was brave as a lion. He
1444,IN THE WOODS.,"was a duke, or marquis, or something. For, you see, we didn’t live in"
1445,IN THE WOODS.,this country in the time of the Revolution.”
1446,IN THE WOODS.,
1447,IN THE WOODS.,“Oh!”
1448,IN THE WOODS.,
1449,IN THE WOODS.,"“No, we lived in France, and belonged to the nobility. I’ve been asking"
1450,IN THE WOODS.,"grandpa all about it, and he told me such a _splen_did story."
1451,IN THE WOODS.,
1452,IN THE WOODS.,“Grandpa” (she has approached the old gentleman in a pause of the debate
1453,IN THE WOODS.,"he is having with the Lieutenant and some others, on the subject of"
1454,IN THE WOODS.,"French politics), “Grandpa, won’t you tell us that story you told me"
1455,IN THE WOODS.,"one evening, about your great-uncle, who was a duke, or marquis, or"
1456,IN THE WOODS.,something?”
1457,IN THE WOODS.,
1458,IN THE WOODS.,"Just now a sunbeam, resting on the little head, turns the long raven"
1459,IN THE WOODS.,“mane” to purple. Purple hair! Strange Aunt Sophia never noticed it
1460,IN THE WOODS.,"before, all these years! She leans forward with a sudden look of"
1461,IN THE WOODS.,interest. Must Marie owe it to the dukes and marquises that she is to
1462,IN THE WOODS.,grow in favor with that lady?
1463,IN THE WOODS.,
1464,IN THE WOODS.,"“Let us not speak of dukes and marquises, my Marie,” her grandfather"
1465,IN THE WOODS.,"has answered, “lest our good friends shall conclude that we are of that"
1466,IN THE WOODS.,"class of people who, not being of perceptible merit themselves, endeavor"
1467,IN THE WOODS.,"to make up for the deficiency by boasting of their ancestors. Whereas,”"
1468,IN THE WOODS.,"with a twinkle of the eye, “if we only trace back far enough, we shall"
1469,IN THE WOODS.,find that we all have the honor of descending from the same illustrious
1470,IN THE WOODS.,tribe—the monkeys.”
1471,IN THE WOODS.,
1472,IN THE WOODS.,"“Oh, you wicked grandpa, to tell such fibs!”"
1473,IN THE WOODS.,
1474,IN THE WOODS.,"“But, no, Mademoiselle, it is even true what I say. At least so we are"
1475,IN THE WOODS.,informed by the celebrated Mr. Darwin.”
1476,IN THE WOODS.,
1477,IN THE WOODS.,"“Well, then, I don’t think much of that Mr. Darwin!”"
1478,IN THE WOODS.,
1479,IN THE WOODS.,“Nor I!” cries Kate. “Nor I!” “Nor I!” “Nor I!” echo several voices. And
1480,IN THE WOODS.,"here, in the midst of an American forest, Darwin and his theories, after"
1481,IN THE WOODS.,"a heated discussion, are, by vote of the majority, consigned to oblivion."
1482,IN THE WOODS.,
1483,IN THE WOODS.,"But during this discussion, Harry, happening to glance that way,"
1484,IN THE WOODS.,"discovers Kate, who has just left the group, kneeling on the brink of"
1485,IN THE WOODS.,"a deep ravine a few yards distant, and looking down with a very pale"
1486,IN THE WOODS.,"face. Catching his eye, she beckons. He is beside her in an instant."
1487,IN THE WOODS.,"“What is it, Katy?” he questions, wonderingly. She motions to be silent,"
1488,IN THE WOODS.,"and to look down. On this side, for a space, the wall of the ravine is"
1489,IN THE WOODS.,"almost perpendicular. At its base, fifty feet below, a stream gurgles"
1490,IN THE WOODS.,"along over broken ledges of rock. Peering over, he sees bashful Bessie"
1491,IN THE WOODS.,Barton working her way up this wall by aid of the shrubbery rooted in the
1492,IN THE WOODS.,"crevices, which latter serve for foothold; and as she climbs she shifts"
1493,IN THE WOODS.,from one arm to the other the little bundle of innocence which answers
1494,IN THE WOODS.,"to the name of Maggie, the dimpled hands clasped about her neck. In the"
1495,IN THE WOODS.,flash of an eye he comprehends it all. While the grown-up people were
1496,IN THE WOODS.,"disputing, the child must have slipped away, and only Bessie noticing her"
1497,IN THE WOODS.,"absence, has come to search. How little three-year-old ever crept down"
1498,IN THE WOODS.,"there, cannot be explained. These tiny creatures will worm themselves"
1499,IN THE WOODS.,into the most astonishing places! Harry’s coat is off directly. He is
1500,IN THE WOODS.,"going to the rescue. But “No,” Kate whispers, “she doesn’t see there’s"
1501,IN THE WOODS.,"any one looking on. The least sound or motion may startle her, and she"
1502,IN THE WOODS.,"will lose her hold, and—and there are the rocks below!”"
1503,IN THE WOODS.,
1504,IN THE WOODS.,"What agony, to watch some one in peril when you may not lift a finger to"
1505,IN THE WOODS.,save! Harry never knew such torture as at this moment.
1506,IN THE WOODS.,
1507,IN THE WOODS.,Slowly the little heroine works her way up. Will her strength give out?
1508,IN THE WOODS.,
1509,IN THE WOODS.,"Oh, you Aunt Sophias, take care how you deride the bashful people! And"
1510,IN THE WOODS.,did you ever hear what the wag said to the philosopher? “Why don’t you
1511,IN THE WOODS.,"hold your head up, as I do?” And this is what the philosopher said to the"
1512,IN THE WOODS.,wag: “If you will examine the heads of wheat in yonder field you will
1513,IN THE WOODS.,find that only those which are erect are empty.”
1514,IN THE WOODS.,
1515,IN THE WOODS.,"To those watching, the moments seem like hours. Ah, Bessie sees them at"
1516,IN THE WOODS.,"last. Wait!—now—quick! Four hands are reached to her, grasp her, lift her"
1517,IN THE WOODS.,with her burden up over the brink. And now that there is no further need
1518,IN THE WOODS.,"of exertion, she sinks back, weak and helpless, in Kate’s arms."
1519,IN THE WOODS.,
1520,IN THE WOODS.,"“Take the child to her mother, Harry, and bring me water—water!”"
1521,IN THE WOODS.,
1522,IN THE WOODS.,"“Why, where have you been, darling?” asks Mrs. McAllister, suddenly"
1523,IN THE WOODS.,"remembering her, now that Darwin is disposed of."
1524,IN THE WOODS.,
1525,IN THE WOODS.,“Me did do to find mo’ bewies.”
1526,IN THE WOODS.,
1527,IN THE WOODS.,"What with laving her forehead, and the fanning, and the cool drink,"
1528,IN THE WOODS.,Bessie soon revives. “She had got down a good ways when I saw her first.
1529,IN THE WOODS.,"I had to follow so still, for fear of frightening her.” So she explains."
1530,IN THE WOODS.,“It was her hat that lay here made me think to look down.”
1531,IN THE WOODS.,
1532,IN THE WOODS.,“What does it mean?” “What has happened?” “Did she faint away?” ask
1533,IN THE WOODS.,"one and another, hurrying up; for all but the two witnesses are still"
1534,IN THE WOODS.,ignorant of that fearful scene.
1535,IN THE WOODS.,
1536,IN THE WOODS.,"“You tell them, Harry,” says Kate; “tell it to them all! tell it to them"
1537,IN THE WOODS.,all! We’ll have it put in the morning papers. We’ll trumpet it from the
1538,IN THE WOODS.,"house-tops and the corners of the streets.” And hugging the little girl,"
1539,IN THE WOODS.,"“Ah, my sweet, you needn’t blush so! I mean they shall appreciate you.”"
1540,IN THE WOODS.,
1541,IN THE WOODS.,And noting the cries of wonder and admiration which follow the boy’s
1542,IN THE WOODS.,"announcements, and the crowd that presses around her shy little friend,"
1543,IN THE WOODS.,"and cannot make enough of her, Mademoiselle is overheard saying softly to"
1544,IN THE WOODS.,"herself: “Why one can be brave, even in these days.”"

1559,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"door or window where they are welcome, and where crumbs are scattered"
1560,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"for them. They flock about it, fearless, chirping cheerily, and make"

1562,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,have become a favorite resort of the youngsters of the neighborhood; for
1563,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"here they may meet unmolested, and chatter and laugh to their hearts’"

1567,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"him, who is denied the sight of their bright young faces, the sound of"

1580,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“Without doubt, my dear children, some of you have heard of that event in"
1581,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,the history of France which is termed the Revolution? I do not speak of
1582,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"those more recent troubles which have distracted my native land, but of"
1583,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,that memorable Revolution which blackened the closing years of the last
1584,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,century—a period at which you gaze as upon a sky filled with the darkness
1585,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"of clouds, and the threatening thunder, and the fierce lightning-flashes."
1586,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,
1587,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“Ah, my children, you are happy to be of a nation which has not that wild"
1588,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"and horrible dream to remember. And here I will say to you, I, that you"
1589,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"are truly fortunate to live in a land most free, where there is less of"
1590,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"oppression than in any other; where one can say what he will, do what he"
1591,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,will. If but he keep the laws he is secure. He may be of whatever party
1592,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"he chooses. Nobody is going to harm him. He may, if so ill-disposed, say"
1593,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,whatever _désagréables_ he please of those who believe not as he. He will
1594,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"not be obliged to fly and to take refuge among strangers, as I myself,"
1595,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"long time ago, for that, in company with others, I preferred a king to an"
1596,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"emperor, and was not sufficiently secret about it. Deserving, indeed, of"
1597,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"gratitude are they who, defending this beautiful country, have preserved"
1598,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,to it peace and freedom.
1599,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,
1600,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“Alas! if poor France had not been for so long burdened with oppressions,"
1601,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"this Revolution could not have occurred. That was the reaction, the"
1602,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,recoil. Let me illustrate. I will remove from my pocket-book this band
1603,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,elastic which confines it. I stretch it with my two hands to its full
1604,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,length. With one hand I release it. It flies back. Ugh! it makes me
1605,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"wince. (That is a very homely illustration, is it not?) Now for a long"
1606,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,time the nations of Europe had been engaged in wars in which France
1607,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,took a leading part. It requires money to conduct wars. To procure it
1608,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"the people are taxed. Also, there was no court so gay and luxurious as"
1609,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,that of France. To support this luxury and splendor required money.
1610,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Still again taxes. When taxes are great the cost of living is increased.
1611,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"Thus while there was feasting and revelry in palaces, in hovels there"
1612,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"was famine and misery. The little ones moaned and sobbed for bread,"
1613,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,and there was no bread to give them. The people were full of wrath at
1614,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,this state of affairs. Force was required to keep them in subjection.
1615,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"Now there came to the throne a good and merciful king, who in peaceful"
1616,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"times would have been much revered. But, in this situation, great wisdom"
1617,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,as well as justice was needful. From his unsteady grasp the reins of
1618,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"government slipped, as you have seen the elastic slip from mine. Behold"
1619,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"the recoil—most terrible!—which destroyed the king, the queen, and all"
1620,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,who believed in the royalist cause. The people who had so long suffered
1621,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,might now take revenge. They who had yearned for liberty were filled with
1622,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"hope. Their land was to be free, like that one beyond the ocean."
1623,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,
1624,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,“Alas! the despotism which had been called a monarchy was succeeded by
1625,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"a despotism far worse, which was called a republic. This was truly the"
1626,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"Reign of Terror. The guillotine was never idle. ‘Madame Guillotine,’"
1627,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"it was entitled—that deadly machine invented for those days, when"
1628,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,victims were so numerous it was necessary that they be dispatched in
1629,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,the swiftest manner possible. This cruel slaughter was chiefly confined
1630,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"to the metropolis, to Paris, until here a province and there a city,"
1631,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"disapproving of their deeds, refused submission to the party in power—the"
1632,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Jacobins. Armies were sent to subdue them. The city of Lyons made the
1633,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"resistance most notable. Thousands of royalists, fleeing for their lives,"
1634,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"had taken shelter there, and were zealous in the defense. They hoped by"
1635,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"this resistance to inspire other towns, and perhaps all France, to arise"
1636,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"and check the course of this Revolution—this monster, ever thirsting"
1637,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"for blood. Alas! it was impossible. Besieged by the republican troops,"
1638,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"all supplies prevented, for lack of food and ammunition the city was at"
1639,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"length obliged to surrender, after a brave and desperate struggle. For"
1640,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,any who had taken up arms against the republic there was now no safety
1641,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"but in flight. Flight was nearly useless. They were pursued, captured."
1642,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"The country was searched for leagues around. Within the city, paid"
1643,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,informers were everywhere seeking whom they might report as guilty. For
1644,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,the head of a priest or noble the price was doubled. The prisons were
1645,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"filled, crowded. Madame Guillotine could not work sufficiently fast. The"
1646,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Reign of Terror had now begun in Lyons also.

1652,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Marquis de Rochemont. In one of the fierce conflicts during the siege
1653,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"he had been seriously wounded, and at the time of the surrender was"
1654,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"unable to attempt an escape. Nevertheless, he had taken the precaution"
1655,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"to remove from his former quarters, and had established himself in a"
1656,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,garret of a lofty but dilapidated tenement facing upon an unfrequented

1658,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"rank, his sole companions his motherless little daughter and a faithful"
1659,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"servant, he thought to avoid the vigilance of the spies. Often, from his"
1660,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"hiding-place, he would hear the explosions of gunpowder, followed by the"

1668,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“One evening, as the attendant was dressing his wounds, the Marquis"

1671,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“The other responded; ‘Just now, as I came up the stairs, I saw some"

1673,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,away. It is enough. I fear we are discovered.’
1674,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,
1675,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“After discussing this matter it was decided that Antoine go out, and"
1676,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"obtain, if possible, a uniform like that worn by the soldiers of the"
1677,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"republic. Disguised in this, the Marquis would depart in the night, and"
1678,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"await in a forest not far from the city, there to be joined by the"

1683,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,“Scarcely had Antoine set forth upon that errand when two _gens d’armes_
1684,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"appeared. They had come to arrest the Marquis. To be arrested, that was"
1685,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"the cell, the mock trial. After these—the scaffold. Had they come in the"
1686,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,name of law and order he would have resigned himself to that fate. They
1687,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,came in the name of disorder and opposition to law. _Bien!_ Disabled as

1690,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"intruders was slain. The other, wounded, fled. Soon he would return with"

1693,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"“Seizing his little daughter, who had been a terrified witness of that"

1695,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,stairs. A ray of the moon lighted an apartment as he passed. He saw
1696,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,through the open door heaps of rags. The ragman lay sleeping in their
1697,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"midst. Near by were his tattered coat, his wooden shoes, his greasy cap,"
1698,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,his basket. The basket was furnished with a lid. One thinks rapidly on
1699,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"such occasions. The Marquis entered, arrayed himself in the coat, the"
1700,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"cap, the shoes, forgetting not to leave some gold coins in their place,"
1701,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,as compensation. The basket would contain the child.

1708,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"through the building to an entrance in the rear, which opened upon an"
1709,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,alley. There he hurried along. Already he could hear the shouts and
1710,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,cries of people gathering in the court-yard. He quickened his steps.
1711,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Not far distant was the bridge which spans the Rhone. He arrived there
1712,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"without interruption. To proceed, to attempt to traverse the extensive"

1714,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,disguise was there security. At the same time the earth seemed to be
1715,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,whirling about. There was a ringing in his ears. He saw some boats upon
1716,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,the bank below. He approached and shoved one of them into the water. He
1717,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,lifted Gabrielle from her concealment and placed her in it. He then rowed
1718,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"out into the midst of the river. There, no need of oars. The current"
1719,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"is swift, strong. It rushed with them away from danger and the doomed"
1720,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,city. He laid himself down in the bottom of the boat. In the moonbeams
1721,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,Gabrielle saw his face very white. She saw his lips move. His hands
1722,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,"reached out to her. She crept to him. Then all was silent. ‘He sleeps,’"
1723,THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.,she said. Soon she slept also.

1846,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,field of battle the night after it has taken place. One is apt to find
1847,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"obstacles in his way. As I groped along, and my eyes became accustomed to"
1848,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"the darkness, I could just distinguish from the surrounding shadows the"
1849,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"figure of this strange guide of mine. It was a monster of a dog—a black,"
1850,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,moving mass. I had known of one other like him. An idea occurred to me.
1851,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,Perhaps this and that dog were the same. That dog’s name was Ponto. So
1852,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"I called—‘Ponto?’ to try him. Back he came bounding, directly, leaping"
1853,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"upon me, and seemed quite delighted. I was pretty certain this was the"
1854,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"dog I knew. As I went along talking to him, some one spoke from among the"
1855,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"shadows—‘Is that you, Walt?’ There was only one person who had been wont"
1856,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,to address me after that fashion. He had recognized _my_ voice. Now I
1857,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"recognized _his_. And it would have been strange, surely, if we had not"
1858,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"known each other’s voice. We were together at college for four years,"
1859,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"and great friends—‘most intimate,’ that is the expression, I believe. I"
1860,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"sometimes went home and spent vacation with him. (He lived in Virginia,"
1861,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,among the mountains.) And sometimes he came home with me. You would
1862,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"hardly remember him; yet, when a very small carriage, containing a very"
1863,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"small child, used to stop at our door, he was always on hand to lift"
1864,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,out that little Mademoiselle and bring her in—only a dainty bundle of
1865,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"embroideries, apparently, till two bright eyes peeped forth, and pretty"
1866,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"soon two little pink fists that would get at his hair and pull it, and"
1867,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"_that_ used to tickle him immensely. Yes, as I said, we were the best of"
1868,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"friends. Then suddenly there was a great gulf between us; and we saw, and"
1869,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"heard, and knew no more of each other. It appears that, though we were"
1870,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"not aware of it, we had been fighting against each other that very day."
1871,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"But now Ponto had brought us together again, and we were glad enough to"
1872,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"meet. So glad we could forget, at last, that he belonged to the army of"
1873,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"the South, and I to the army of the Union. We had a great many matters to"
1874,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"talk over, not having seen each other in some time. Ah, but we _couldn’t_"
1875,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"see, as you know. So we had to be content with saying our farewells in"
1876,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"the dark. For that was the way our talk ended, Marie. He passed away,"
1877,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"there in the night, I supporting him as best I could. Ponto was his dying"
1878,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"gift. Come here, old fellow.” And the Lieutenant hides his face against"
1879,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,the dog’s shaggy shoulder.
1880,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,
1881,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"Marie steals softly from the house and toward home. And when, a moment"
1882,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"after, Kate comes down the hall stairs and into the room, Ponto lifts"
1883,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"to her great, gentle, human, sympathizing eyes. Perhaps he guesses she,"
1884,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,"too, has a share in those remembrances. For who shall deny that he has"
1885,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,thoughts?
1886,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,
1887,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,
1888,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,
1889,BUTTERNUT AND BLUE.,
1890,A SECRET.,A SECRET.
1891,A SECRET.,
1892,A SECRET.,
1893,A SECRET.,"“Why, _you_, Harry? I didn’t know you had come home!” Kate, glancing up"
1894,A SECRET.,"from the book from which she had been reading aloud, has only at this"
1895,A SECRET.,moment noticed the boy’s entrance.
1896,A SECRET.,
1897,A SECRET.,“I haven’t been home yet. I wanted to consult you first. You see I’m
1898,A SECRET.,"expelled.” (Harry, you must know, has been away at school since early"
1899,A SECRET.,"in September.) “Thought I’d tell you on the start, so you wouldn’t feel"
1900,A SECRET.,"imposed upon. Why, you take it all as a matter of course! You don’t look"
1901,A SECRET.,a bit surprised!’
1902,A SECRET.,
1903,A SECRET.,"“To tell the truth, we’re _not_ very. And how do you do, you blessed boy?"
1904,A SECRET.,You don’t know how we’ve missed you!” And Kate seizes his two hands with
1905,A SECRET.,a heartiness that proves her faith in him is still unshaken.
1906,A SECRET.,
1907,A SECRET.,"“Miss Katy! if you’ve got a particle of respect left for me, won’t you"
1908,A SECRET.,give me some supper? I’m hungry as a bear. Just got in on the train.
1909,A SECRET.,Haven’t had a mouthful to eat since noon!”
1910,A SECRET.,
1911,A SECRET.,“The poor child! So he _should_ have some supper. I’ll go directly and
1912,A SECRET.,see about it.”
1913,A SECRET.,
1914,A SECRET.,"“This was the way it happened,” Harry explains, over the waffles and"
1915,A SECRET.,"coffee. “You see, when I first went there the boys were a solemncholy"
1916,A SECRET.,"lot, oh, I tell you! studious as owls, got to improve each shining"
1917,A SECRET.,"hour, and all that. Well, I thought if that sort of thing was going to"
1918,A SECRET.,last I shouldn’t survive long. So I went to work and got ’em stirred
1919,A SECRET.,"up after awhile, and things got to be kind of lively. But Tabby—that’s"
1920,A SECRET.,"the Principal—the way he hangs his eye out’s a caution. Oh, no, Miss"
1921,A SECRET.,Katy; that’s only a nickname we gave him; he’s got such a cattish way of
1922,A SECRET.,prowling around nights to see if there’s any doings going on. Anything
1923,A SECRET.,"but a sneak! Well, I thought I’d be even with ’im; so last night I laid"
1924,A SECRET.,"torpedoes all along the hall; oh, Miss Katy, nothing but those little"
1925,A SECRET.,"paper wads that never hurt anybody in the world. Well, the last bell"
1926,A SECRET.,"rung and we put out the lights, and lay still and listened. By’n by—pop!"
1927,A SECRET.,"pop! pop! Tabby was coming to see if everything was all right. Ha, ha!"
1928,A SECRET.,guess his moccasins must ’ave run against every identical one. You’d
1929,A SECRET.,’ave thought he was having a Fourth of July celebration out there all by
1930,A SECRET.,"himself. But wasn’t he hoppin’ mad, though! Called me into the study this"
1931,A SECRET.,morning right after breakfast.”
1932,A SECRET.,
1933,A SECRET.,"[Illustration: “Ha, ha! guess his moccasins must ’ave run against every"
1934,A SECRET.,identical one.”—PAGE 78.]
1935,A SECRET.,
1936,A SECRET.,“‘Did you place those torpedoes in the hall last night?’ says he.
1937,A SECRET.,
1938,A SECRET.,"“‘Yes, sir,’ says I."
1939,A SECRET.,
1940,A SECRET.,“‘What was your object?’
1941,A SECRET.,
1942,A SECRET.,"“‘Fun,’ says I."
1943,A SECRET.,
1944,A SECRET.,"“Well, he gave me a long lecture, said he didn’t like my influence in the"
1945,A SECRET.,"school, that he’d had more trouble during the few weeks I’d been there"
1946,A SECRET.,"than in any five years before. Well, the long an’ short of it was I’d"
1947,A SECRET.,"got to leave. That was just what I wanted. So off I come, and here I am,"
1948,A SECRET.,"with a letter for father in my pocket that gives me an awful setting out,"
1949,A SECRET.,I expect.” (Harry’s countenance grows suddenly grave.) “I wouldn’t care
1950,A SECRET.,if it was only father I’d got to chalk up to; but Aunt Sophi’!” (No use
1951,A SECRET.,"trying to describe the tone in which that name is uttered.) “I thought,"
1952,A SECRET.,"Katy—I thought, maybe you’d be willing to go over there, and—well, kind"
1953,A SECRET.,"of talk her around, you know—why, kind of smooth matters, that is, so she"
1954,A SECRET.,"won’t be quite so hard on a fellow. Won’t you, now? If you will I’ll go"
1955,A SECRET.,"back there to old Williams, and I’ll study like anything! I will, now,"
1956,A SECRET.,"and behave myself; oh, you shall see! if you’ll only go this once.”"
1957,A SECRET.,
1958,A SECRET.,Kate doesn’t like to get up a reputation for being meddlesome; but she
1959,A SECRET.,"recalls how kind and attentive this boy has been to her brother, and it"
1960,A SECRET.,is not in her heart to refuse. So she leaves the two chatting by the
1961,A SECRET.,fireside and crosses the street to spend an evening with Aunt Sophia.
1962,A SECRET.,
1963,A SECRET.,"“I don’t know what possesses me, sometimes,” says Harry, at length,"
1964,A SECRET.,waxing confidential as usually when alone with the Lieutenant. “I believe
1965,A SECRET.,it’s the Old Nick! I was always getting into scrapes ever since I was
1966,A SECRET.,"knee-high to a grasshopper. Now, some fellows find it smooth sailing all"
1967,A SECRET.,"along, never get into trouble. I wonder why?”"
1968,A SECRET.,
1969,A SECRET.,“Perhaps they are not so blessed with animal spirits.”
1970,A SECRET.,
1971,A SECRET.,"“Well, I don’t see how it’s to be called a blessing.”"
1972,A SECRET.,
1973,A SECRET.,"“The river flowing through our town is a mischievous river, sometimes,"
1974,A SECRET.,"especially in spring, when the snow is melting, and, overfed by the"
1975,A SECRET.,"streams from the hills, it comes rushing along, sweeping away dams and"
1976,A SECRET.,"bridges, and tearing about generally, in a very unreasonable fashion."
1977,A SECRET.,"Yet farther on, at Factoryville, where it plunges over the rocks, it"
1978,A SECRET.,"keeps the mills going all the year round. In fact, there would be no"
1979,A SECRET.,mills there if it were not for our brave little river ‘putting its
1980,A SECRET.,"shoulder to the wheel.’ Besides, we must admit, it is quite an important"
1981,A SECRET.,"feature in the landscape, winding among the woods and fields, flashing"
1982,A SECRET.,and shimmering in the sunlight. And how often you and I have stopped
1983,A SECRET.,to listen to the plash and ripple of its waters as we walked along the
1984,A SECRET.,"banks. I remember what company that music was to me, one dark night, a"
1985,A SECRET.,"good while ago, when I was returning from a long tramp up the valley."
1986,A SECRET.,"Just so, since the loss of my eyesight has made for me continual night,"
1987,A SECRET.,"you scarcely would believe, Harry, how many times I have been cheered by"
1988,A SECRET.,"your merry flow of spirits. As sister says, we have missed you. It is no"
1989,A SECRET.,small thing to be missed by one’s friends when he is away from them. Nor
1990,A SECRET.,"is such a good-for-nothing, stove-up piece of humanity as myself the only"
1991,A SECRET.,"one you can find to cheer, if you will look about you. Life is full of"
1992,A SECRET.,shadows. It is a sorrowful sort of night to multitudes of people. Such
1993,A SECRET.,"natures as yours were meant to make the darkness less dreary, and when"
1994,A SECRET.,you come to the mill-wheels to turn them.”
1995,A SECRET.,
1996,A SECRET.,“But the mill-wheels? I don’t exactly understand about that.”
1997,A SECRET.,
1998,A SECRET.,"“Well, for instance, the weather is growing cold; winter is not far"
1999,A SECRET.,off. We sit here by a fire and find it very comfortable. There are a
2000,A SECRET.,good many to-night who haven’t any fire. We have had our supper. There
2001,A SECRET.,are a good many who must go without. If you will notice in the streets
2002,A SECRET.,"to-morrow, you will see little feet shoeless, stockingless. People who go"
2003,A SECRET.,"without food, and fire, and sufficient clothing, get sick, have fevers,"
2004,A SECRET.,"diphtheria, what not? But, unfortunately, the fevers, and so forth, won’t"
2005,A SECRET.,"stay shut up in alleys and tumble-down tenements; they creep out, out"
2006,A SECRET.,"into the broad streets, into the fine mansions of brick and stone, and"
2007,A SECRET.,"all over the city, hunting for the cunning little Ediths, the pretty"
2008,A SECRET.,Maries.”
2009,A SECRET.,
2010,A SECRET.,"“Oh, I never thought of that!”"
2011,A SECRET.,
2012,A SECRET.,"“People who haven’t food, and fire, and warm clothing, often attempt to"
2013,A SECRET.,"steal them, or the wherewithal to pay for them. People who steal, if they"
2014,A SECRET.,"are caught at it, go to prison. When they come out again nobody will"
2015,A SECRET.,"trust them or employ them. Since they cannot find work, and have got to"
2016,A SECRET.,"live somehow, what must they do? Steal. So it comes about that a great"
2017,A SECRET.,many people steal for a living. And where did all this crime commence?
2018,A SECRET.,"Like the fevers, with the lack of food, and fire, and clothing. As"
2019,A SECRET.,Tennyson’s ‘Northern Farmer’ says:—
2020,A SECRET.,
2021,A SECRET.,"“‘’Tisn’ them as ’as munny as breäks into ’ouses an’ steäls,"
2022,A SECRET.,Them as ’as coäts to their backs and taäks their regular meäls.
2023,A SECRET.,"Noä, but it’s them as niver knaws wheer a meäl’s to be ’ad.’”"
2024,A SECRET.,
2025,A SECRET.,“That puts me in mind of the fellow that broke into our house.”
2026,A SECRET.,
2027,A SECRET.,“This is the first I have heard of it.”
2028,A SECRET.,
2029,A SECRET.,"“Why, you see, one night last winter I thought I heard somebody in the"
2030,A SECRET.,dining-room. So down I went. There ’e was at the sideboard. He’d got it
2031,A SECRET.,"open, and was taking the silver out. Well, I pitched at ’im—you know I’m"
2032,A SECRET.,"some on the muscle—and got hold of his revolver, and there I had ’im."
2033,A SECRET.,"But my! he looked so starved, and kind of forlorn, and hollow-eyed, I"
2034,A SECRET.,opened the front door for ’im and let ’im go. Expect I ought to ’ave
2035,A SECRET.,handed ’im over to the police. Guess I never told of it before. It might
2036,A SECRET.,"scare the women-folks, you know. But wouldn’t it give Aunt Sophi the"
2037,A SECRET.,fidgets? After that I used to sleep with one ear open. She didn’t know
2038,A SECRET.,she was sending away her watch-dog when she hustled me off to school in
2039,A SECRET.,such a hurry.”
2040,A SECRET.,
2041,A SECRET.,The Lieutenant reflects. Here is a boy who does not hesitate to cope with
2042,A SECRET.,"a burglar, who has been known to risk his own life to rescue a drowning"
2043,A SECRET.,"companion, and yet is loth to enter his home from dread of an Aunt"
2044,A SECRET.,Sophia’s tongue.
2045,A SECRET.,
2046,A SECRET.,"“Then turning the mill-wheels,” Harry resumes, “that means helping the"
2047,A SECRET.,poor?”
2048,A SECRET.,
2049,A SECRET.,"“Partly, yes. Though, as one thinks about it, it seems to imply much"
2050,A SECRET.,more.”
2051,A SECRET.,
2052,A SECRET.,"“But where’s a body to begin? There’s poverty enough, I suppose; but some"
2053,A SECRET.,"are so proud you can’t get at ’em, and some, but they’ve got the cheek!"
2054,A SECRET.,dogging you and sticking their paws out for a penny every turn you take.
2055,A SECRET.,I always think they’re sham.”
2056,A SECRET.,
2057,A SECRET.,“It might be a good way to exercise one’s ingenuity finding out. As for
2058,A SECRET.,"the pride, you’ve read in the story-books of the needfuls that found"
2059,A SECRET.,their way mysteriously to empty cupboards. It sounds rather fanciful;
2060,A SECRET.,yet there are people who take great delight in putting romance into real
2061,A SECRET.,"life, and a generous deed is none the worse for being delicately done.”"
2062,A SECRET.,
2063,A SECRET.,"“But that _would_ be jolly, now! Jinks! I’d go at it to-morrow if I only"
2064,A SECRET.,knew where to begin.”
2065,A SECRET.,
2066,A SECRET.,“Sister could give you more information on that subject than I can. You
2067,A SECRET.,"two will have to put your heads together and talk it over. Ah, yes! and"
2068,A SECRET.,I have in mind a little newsboy to whom you can be of service. I really
2069,A SECRET.,believe our rollicking Harry would be better satisfied with himself for
2070,A SECRET.,"using some of his extra energy and pocket-money in these ways. Come,"
2071,A SECRET.,"let him give the Tabbies, and Old Williamses, as he calls them, a rest."
2072,A SECRET.,There’s something better for him to do than worrying them. As I heard
2073,A SECRET.,said once: ‘There is so much to be done in this world! There are so few
2074,A SECRET.,"to do it.’ You are going to be one of those few, surely. A rich man’s"
2075,A SECRET.,son has it in his power to set a great many wheels in motion. You see
2076,A SECRET.,the Lieutenant is quite a sermonizer when he gets fairly started. But I
2077,A SECRET.,"have taken this opportunity to be earnest, for once, and before it is too"
2078,A SECRET.,late.”
2079,A SECRET.,
2080,A SECRET.,"Before it is too late! Harry, who has been wondering, the while, at this"
2081,A SECRET.,"serious language, so uncommon from his genial friend, wonders still more"
2082,A SECRET.,"at that expression. What does he mean? He asks, finally."
2083,A SECRET.,
2084,A SECRET.,“I’m half sorry I let the words escape me; but now that I have aroused
2085,A SECRET.,"your curiosity, and since you trust me with your secrets, well, yes, I"
2086,A SECRET.,will tell you. You know one mustn’t expect to engage in battles and come
2087,A SECRET.,"out whole and sound. One day a small, round piece of lead discharged from"
2088,A SECRET.,"a rifle took lodgings in my shoulder, and has since been slowly working"
2089,A SECRET.,its way down towards my heart. So it seems that a bullet is to be the
2090,A SECRET.,death of me after all.”
2091,A SECRET.,
2092,A SECRET.,Harry stares at the Lieutenant in mute amazement. Death! He suddenly
2093,A SECRET.,becomes aware how strong are the cords of love which bind him to the
2094,A SECRET.,"blind man. To lose him, his best friend! No more confidential talks, him"
2095,A SECRET.,"no more to come to in trouble, and doubt, and perplexity, and lay open"
2096,A SECRET.,all one’s thoughts! he who first discovered good in the wayward nature—a
2097,A SECRET.,"little, tender plant, so covered by the dust that others could not see,"
2098,A SECRET.,and helped it to grow and thrive in spite of the trampling that else
2099,A SECRET.,would have destroyed it.
2100,A SECRET.,
2101,A SECRET.,"“Oh, Lieutenant! it isn’t true! Something can be done!”"
2102,A SECRET.,
2103,A SECRET.,"No, it appears from the reply, nothing can be done."
2104,A SECRET.,
2105,A SECRET.,"“Nobody knows? Katy doesn’t know?” the boy asks, at length, in a husky,"
2106,A SECRET.,tremulous voice.
2107,A SECRET.,
2108,A SECRET.,“The surgeon and Lem have known of it only. It was on sister’s account
2109,A SECRET.,that I wished the matter to be kept quiet. I wanted to spare her the
2110,A SECRET.,sadness as long as possible. But I must tell her very soon. It will not
2111,A SECRET.,"do for it to come upon her too suddenly. Ah, my Katy!” and another voice"
2112,A SECRET.,is low and tremulous.
2113,A SECRET.,
2114,A SECRET.,“Is it painful ever?”
2115,A SECRET.,
2116,A SECRET.,“Sometimes.”
2117,A SECRET.,
2118,A SECRET.,“And you’ve kept it to yourself all these years! We didn’t know!”
2119,A SECRET.,
2120,A SECRET.,From the chimney corner where he has been lounging Harry gazes once more
2121,A SECRET.,"at the patient face, pallid from silent, secret suffering, at the empty"
2122,A SECRET.,"sleeve, at the eyes which cannot see; then he throws himself flat upon"
2123,A SECRET.,the carpet in a fit of weeping—he who so rarely sheds a tear—and his
2124,A SECRET.,"surprise, and grief, and anger, take expression in one passionate outcry"
2125,A SECRET.,against the war which caused all this—that brothers’ war!
2126,A SECRET.,
2127,A SECRET.,"But as he lies there sobbing, listening to some calm and soothing words,"
2128,A SECRET.,there comes to him—even to Harry—a remembrance of a face he has somewhere
2129,A SECRET.,"seen pictured. That, too, was a pallid face and patient. It drooped from"
2130,A SECRET.,a cross; and the brow was encircled by thorns; and underneath was written:
2131,A SECRET.,
2132,IT IS FINISHED.,IT IS FINISHED.
2133,IT IS FINISHED.,
2134,IT IS FINISHED.,
2135,IT IS FINISHED.,
2136,IT IS FINISHED.,
2137,CONSOLATION.,CONSOLATION.
2138,CONSOLATION.,
2139,CONSOLATION.,
2140,CONSOLATION.,“It’s lonesome without _him_!”
2141,CONSOLATION.,
2142,CONSOLATION.,You may have noticed those high walls which some build about their houses
2143,CONSOLATION.,"and grounds, so high you can get but a glimpse of the tree-tops above"
2144,CONSOLATION.,"them; the shady walks, and gushing fountains, and green grass-plats, and"
2145,CONSOLATION.,bright flowers are entirely hidden from view.
2146,CONSOLATION.,
2147,CONSOLATION.,"A certain great man died, and the tidings was carried swiftly and far,"
2148,CONSOLATION.,for his name was known to many nations. All over the land there were
2149,CONSOLATION.,"public demonstrations of mourning, and numberless and eloquent were the"
2150,CONSOLATION.,"eulogies pronounced. Thus he who, living, had been laden with honors and"
2151,CONSOLATION.,"distinctions, went in pomp and honor to his burial. Yet somehow we do not"
2152,CONSOLATION.,"hear that any one was really very sorry because of his death, much less"
2153,CONSOLATION.,that any little children wept because of it. Had his greatness been like
2154,CONSOLATION.,"a high wall, concealing whatever was sunny and winsome in his nature?"
2155,CONSOLATION.,On the same hillside where that great man was laid to rest there is a
2156,CONSOLATION.,"new-made grave beneath the cedars, and not very many people know anything"
2157,CONSOLATION.,"about it; but among those who do there is a void, as when the fire goes"
2158,CONSOLATION.,"out upon the hearth-stone, and all is cold and desolate. “It is no small"
2159,CONSOLATION.,thing to be missed by one’s friends when he is away from them.” Little
2160,CONSOLATION.,"did he consider, who spoke thus, how truly those words would soon apply"
2161,CONSOLATION.,to himself. And here one might pause to ponder. Which is preferable—to be
2162,CONSOLATION.,so great and renowned that when one dies the news will be told abroad in
2163,CONSOLATION.,"the world, or to be so genial and lovable that even a little child will"
2164,CONSOLATION.,weep at the sight of his vacant chair?
2165,CONSOLATION.,
2166,CONSOLATION.,"When we are sleeping in our graves so still,"
2167,CONSOLATION.,"When we are sleeping in our graves so low,"
2168,CONSOLATION.,"Ah, who will care to know?"
2169,CONSOLATION.,"Ah, who will?"
2170,CONSOLATION.,
2171,CONSOLATION.,"A wee bird made its nest out in the porch last May, and lived there the"
2172,CONSOLATION.,"summer long. But the summer is gone, and the winter is come again, and"
2173,CONSOLATION.,"the bird has flown away, and the nest is empty, and the snow is on it"
2174,CONSOLATION.,"and on the ground, and the clouds are gray and threatening, and again"
2175,CONSOLATION.,"the wind wails at the casements, moans down the chimney. Lem, coming in"
2176,CONSOLATION.,"to replenish the fire, sees the form shivering over it in spite of the"
2177,CONSOLATION.,"warmth, sees the wide, tearless eyes, with the new, strange look in them,"
2178,CONSOLATION.,"sees the carpet strewn with remnants of a rare and fragrant bouquet,"
2179,CONSOLATION.,"Harry’s gift, torn to bits by nervous fingers."
2180,CONSOLATION.,
2181,CONSOLATION.,"“Miss Katy,” and he lays his hand gently on her head, “try to think"
2182,CONSOLATION.,of something else; jess try. Think of all the poor folks you an’ Mr.
2183,CONSOLATION.,"Harry’s got on the dockit, an’ what’ll become of ’em if you don’t pick up"
2184,CONSOLATION.,"sperrits an’ help ’im look after ’em a little. Come, they’s no time to"
2185,CONSOLATION.,"be settin’ here idle!” You would hardly guess his voice was choking, and"
2186,CONSOLATION.,that tears were streaming down his black face.
2187,CONSOLATION.,
2188,CONSOLATION.,"“Oh, Lem,” she answers drearily, “I’m tired; I’m tired of living. I can’t"
2189,CONSOLATION.,care for anything any more.”
2190,CONSOLATION.,
2191,CONSOLATION.,"“But you _must_ care, honey. What’ll become of poor old ’Liza an’ me if"
2192,CONSOLATION.,Katy goes off an’ leaves us too?”
2193,CONSOLATION.,
2194,CONSOLATION.,"But she only hovers more closely over the fire, staring at it vacantly."
2195,CONSOLATION.,And the wind moans and wails down the chimney.
2196,CONSOLATION.,
2197,CONSOLATION.,"Lem returns to the kitchen to consult with his wife, Eliza, as to what"
2198,CONSOLATION.,shall be done for her in whose welfare they have felt such a tender
2199,CONSOLATION.,"interest since, years ago, she and her brother were left orphans. Not all"
2200,CONSOLATION.,"the heartfelt sympathy of young and old, and the loving little attentions"
2201,CONSOLATION.,"of the children, seem to be of any avail. Eliza advises to go for Edith."
2202,CONSOLATION.,“She used to ’muse Master Wallie.”
2203,CONSOLATION.,
2204,CONSOLATION.,"But once in the room, her toys about her, Edith soon ceases to play."
2205,CONSOLATION.,There is a change. Somebody is gone who used to be here. She may somewhat
2206,CONSOLATION.,"have forgotten all that has been passing of late, scarcely can have"
2207,CONSOLATION.,understood what has been told her; but whether she thinks about it or
2208,CONSOLATION.,"not, or remembers, even, she feels a want. “It’s lonesome without _him_!”"
2209,CONSOLATION.,"Ah, that is it; and she begins to sob, creeping close to Kate. But what"
2210,CONSOLATION.,"new thing is this? Katy doesn’t notice her! Those queer, staring eyes,"
2211,CONSOLATION.,"that do not turn and smile upon her, they are not Katy’s eyes. That"
2212,CONSOLATION.,"white, stony face, that is not like Katy, either. And all the while the"
2213,CONSOLATION.,"wind is moaning and wailing, and the gloomy clouds grow gloomier, making"
2214,CONSOLATION.,"the day dreary and the room dreary. Everything is dreary and lonesome,"
2215,CONSOLATION.,"and not as it used to be. She flies into the hall, crying and calling to"
2216,CONSOLATION.,"Lem, below."
2217,CONSOLATION.,
2218,CONSOLATION.,“Take me home! I’m afraid! Katy isn’t Katy any more!”
2219,CONSOLATION.,
2220,CONSOLATION.,"“Oh, come back, Edie!” calls Kate, arousing at that pitiful little cry"
2221,CONSOLATION.,and holding out her hands to the child. “Don’t go away and leave Katy all
2222,CONSOLATION.,alone! She’ll be good now. She’s sorry she scared Edie; she didn’t mean
2223,CONSOLATION.,to.”
2224,CONSOLATION.,
2225,CONSOLATION.,“_Are_ you all alone?” Edith has stopped crying suddenly. There is a
2226,CONSOLATION.,peculiar earnestness in her look as she questions.
2227,CONSOLATION.,
2228,CONSOLATION.,"“Yes, Edie, all alone! all alone!” and the answer ends almost in a wail."
2229,CONSOLATION.,
2230,CONSOLATION.,"“Then it’s there—there, behind the book—the paper that he did write on. I"
2231,CONSOLATION.,"must give it to you when you was all alone, he said—my captain. He said,"
2232,CONSOLATION.,"would I ’member? Ha, ha! I _did_ ’member, didn’t I?”"
2233,CONSOLATION.,
2234,CONSOLATION.,"Kate opens the book-case, and finds, as the child said, a folded paper"
2235,CONSOLATION.,behind one of the encyclopædias. It contains some lines written with
2236,CONSOLATION.,"pencil, so running together, lines and words, as to be almost unreadable."
2237,CONSOLATION.,"As she recognizes that handwriting and slowly deciphers it, the tears"
2238,CONSOLATION.,"come at last like rain. Edith, no longer afraid, wipes them away with her"
2239,CONSOLATION.,"little white apron, murmuring, the while, all sorts of baby talk."
2240,CONSOLATION.,
2241,CONSOLATION.,About two hundred years ago there lived a blind man who was the author of
2242,CONSOLATION.,what many think to be the greatest of poems. But wherever that wonderful
2243,CONSOLATION.,"work is read and admired, there, too, it is told how his daughters, with"
2244,CONSOLATION.,"one exception, were unkind to him and undutiful, refusing even the task"
2245,CONSOLATION.,"of committing to paper those immortal verses. However, it may be he was a"
2246,CONSOLATION.,"trifle to blame, himself. (For we have seen, as in that other case, how"
2247,CONSOLATION.,"greatness does sometimes build for itself a barrier, a high, impassable"
2248,CONSOLATION.,"wall.) Suppose day after day little eyes looked up wistfully, and he"
2249,CONSOLATION.,did not see—gazing far off into other worlds and other ages; little
2250,CONSOLATION.,"voices whispered timidly, and he did not hear—listening to the converse"
2251,CONSOLATION.,"of angels; little hands clung caressingly, but unheeded. Ah, that was"
2252,CONSOLATION.,asking for bread and getting a stone. Suppose it made some little hearts
2253,CONSOLATION.,"ache, some little people were “afraid,” finally, like Edith, awhile"
2254,CONSOLATION.,"since. So when they grew up and he grew old and sightless, what came"
2255,CONSOLATION.,"of it all? _Paradise Lost_, to be marveled at as long as the English"
2256,CONSOLATION.,"language is known and studied, and there in shadowy background, the"
2257,CONSOLATION.,"mighty genius, poor and blind, with his unloving daughters."
2258,CONSOLATION.,
2259,CONSOLATION.,"And now, girl readers, here is that writing which to her, so sorrowful,"
2260,CONSOLATION.,is like a consoling message from the Beyond.

2266,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"wrote books, or painted pictures, or spoke or sang to gaping"
2267,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"crowds, weren’t worth her little finger. At least, so he"
2268,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,thought—this selfish fellow—and with good reason. For he owed
2269,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"it to her that life was not a burden; rather, he owed it to her"
2270,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"that life was a pleasure. Ah, what could she have done that"
2271,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,she did not do for him? Like a good fairy she hovered about
2272,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"him, studying and scheming for his comfort and diversion from"
2273,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,morning till night. Would he be read to? She would read to him
2274,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,by the hour. Did some rhyme or foolish fancy escape him? She
2275,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"was only too eager to preserve it. She was eyes for him, she"
2276,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"was his good right hand, she was everything! Ah, how unmindful"
2277,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"of self, how thoughtful of him always! even striving to forget"
2278,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"some sorrows of her own, lest her sadness might make him sad!"
2279,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"And now that he is gone, and she has nothing to regret—not"
2280,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"one impatient word or act—and to remember only unwearied,"
2281,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"loving care, ceaseless devotion, let her be comforted. Surely"
2282,FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.,"“she hath done what she could.” Oh, my sister, my sister, be"

2300,I.,
2301,I.,Who could she be—the little stranger asleep in the cabin?
2302,I.,
2303,I.,Nobody could tell.
2304,I.,
2305,I.,"She must have come aboard unnoticed, hours ago, at the French port where"
2306,I.,the vessel had been lying for repairs. Had she wandered away from her
2307,I.,"home, and innocently lain down here to rest? In that home there would"
2308,I.,"be grief, and anxiety, and long waiting, or ever she would return; for"
2309,I.,"the ship was now many leagues out at sea, and the child had just been"
2310,I.,discovered.
2311,I.,
2312,I.,"The sound of voices talking the matter over wakened the little girl, and"
2313,I.,she shrank timidly from all the eyes fixed inquiringly upon her. So the
2314,I.,"captain sent every one away, and sat down by her, and in her own language"
2315,I.,questioned:
2316,I.,
2317,I.,"“How came you here, little one?”"
2318,I.,
2319,I.,"“Is not this, then, the ship which goes to America? There was a man in"
2320,I.,"the street who told me it should go to America. Is it, then, a mistake?”"
2321,I.,
2322,I.,"“No, not a mistake. And you wish to go to America?”"
2323,I.,
2324,I.,"“Oui, monsieur. I go to Julien.”"
2325,I.,
2326,I.,“And who is Julien?”
2327,I.,
2328,I.,“He is my brother.”
2329,I.,
2330,I.,“But how does it happen that you go alone?”
2331,I.,
2332,I.,“I have none to accompany me.”
2333,I.,
2334,I.,“Have you neither father nor mother?”
2335,I.,
2336,I.,"“Non, monsieur.”"
2337,I.,
2338,I.,“Does your brother know you are coming?”
2339,I.,
2340,I.,"“Non, monsieur, he does not know it. It will be a surprise.”"
2341,I.,
2342,I.,"“But what put it into your head, little—what shall I call you? What is"
2343,I.,your name?”
2344,I.,
2345,I.,“Julie Leblanc.”
2346,I.,
2347,I.,"“Well, then, my little Julie, how is it that you happen to be going to"
2348,I.,"America? America is a long way off, do you know it?”"
2349,I.,
2350,I.,"“But no! is it, then? It cannot be far away where Julien is. Is it"
2351,I.,farther than Paris?”
2352,I.,
2353,I.,"“A good deal farther, Julie.”"
2354,I.,
2355,I.,"“But what to do! No home, no friend. Only Julien.”"
2356,I.,
2357,I.,"“No home, no friend!” repeated the captain, stroking the dark hair,"
2358,I.,pityingly. “Did the father fall in battle?”
2359,I.,
2360,I.,"“Yes, monsieur, many years ago, before I can remember.”"
2361,I.,
2362,I.,“And how long is it that little Julie has been without home or friends?”
2363,I.,
2364,I.,"“Since they took my dear mamma away to the burial,” answered the child,"
2365,I.,her eyes brimming with tears.
2366,I.,
2367,I.,After awhile the captain asked:
2368,I.,
2369,I.,"“Julie, do you know just where your brother is, in what part of America?”"
2370,I.,
2371,I.,"“In what part, monsieur? Is it then so great a city? But, without doubt,"
2372,I.,there will be one who can tell me where he lives. In our village one knew
2373,I.,everybody.”
2374,I.,
2375,I.,"“Whew!” exclaimed the captain, twirling his thumbs."
2376,I.,
2377,I.,“Or I will stand at the corner of the street until he passes by. I shall
2378,I.,"know him, without doubt, he is so handsome. Oh, monsieur, I would know"
2379,I.,"him anywhere. I knew him instantly the last time I saw him, although he"
2380,I.,"wore the clothes of Jacques, the mason.”"
2381,I.,
2382,I.,"As the captain seemed interested, Julie explained:"
2383,I.,
2384,I.,“I awoke in the night. It was the dear mamma who stood by my bed with
2385,I.,"a candle in the hand, and one with her like Jacques until I meet his"
2386,I.,"beautiful eyes. Then I laugh gaily and cry, ‘Ah, behold thee, my brother,"
2387,I.,covered with plaster! and thy coat too large for thee! Didst thou think
2388,I.,"to fool me?’ But our mother lays the finger upon her lip, and her face"
2389,I.,"is very pale; and Julien kisses and embraces me without ceasing, and with"
2390,I.,"tears, and I know not what to make of it. Soon they go out and I fall"
2391,I.,"again to sleep. Oh, monsieur, he came that same night to America! It was"
2392,I.,"not an hour after, while I slept—mamma has told me it—that the wicked"
2393,I.,gendarmes came and searched the house for him!”
2394,I.,
2395,I.,“Ah! the gendarmes! and why?”
2396,I.,
2397,I.,“Because—mamma said—he had written something in the journals which meant
2398,I.,that the Emperor was not a good Emperor; and for _that_ the wicked
2399,I.,gendarmes would have put my poor brother in prison.”
2400,I.,
2401,I.,"“Go on, my pretty one,” said the captain, smiling, “thou knowest how to"
2402,I.,talk. Thou art more entertaining than a book. How old art thou?”
2403,I.,
2404,I.,“Ten years.”
2405,I.,
2406,I.,“You are small for that age. Have you ever been to school?”
2407,I.,
2408,I.,"“Never, monsieur. It was the governess who taught me.”"
2409,I.,
2410,I.,“The governess—bah! Did she ever see a geography?”
2411,I.,
2412,I.,"“Geography, monsieur? What is that? Is it an animal?”"
2413,I.,
2414,I.,“Bah! What did she teach you?”
2415,I.,
2416,I.,"“The dance, and the drawing, and the embroidery, and the music—”"
2417,I.,
2418,I.,“The music?—can you sing?”
2419,I.,
2420,I.,"“A little, monsieur.”"
2421,I.,
2422,I.,"“Sing me, then, a little song.”"
2423,I.,
2424,I.,So Julie sang a little song. It was the “Farewell.”
2425,I.,
2426,I.,"Adieu! ne m’oublie pas, etc."
2427,I.,
2428,I.,“Bravo!” applauded the captain when she had finished. Then he went up on
2429,I.,deck.
2430,I.,
2431,I.,Julie recollected something as he passed out. She carefully drew a small
2432,I.,package from the folds of her dress and ran after him. The rolling of the
2433,I.,"ship made her dizzy. She reeled and would have fallen, had not a sailor"
2434,I.,caught her hand.
2435,I.,
2436,I.,"“Merci” (thank you), she said."
2437,I.,
2438,I.,That brought another to the rescue.
2439,I.,
2440,I.,"“Merci, merci!” she repeated."
2441,I.,
2442,I.,Half a dozen of the crew came to learn the cause of alarm.
2443,I.,
2444,I.,"“Merci, merci, merci!” she screamed. Would they never understand?"
2445,I.,
2446,I.,"The captain did, and laughed heartily."
2447,I.,
2448,I.,"“And what can I do for mademoiselle?” he asked as she approached, smiling"
2449,I.,at sight of his bronzed and furrowed face—already that of an old friend
2450,I.,"among this crowd of seamen—strangers, from a country where “mercy!” is a"
2451,I.,frequent exclamation.
2452,I.,
2453,I.,"[Illustration: “Because this, mamma said, must pay for my voyage.”—PAGE"
2454,I.,99.]
2455,I.,
2456,I.,"“Good monsieur, are you the man who takes the moneys? Because this, mamma"
2457,I.,"said, must pay for my voyage.” She gave to him the little parcel."
2458,I.,
2459,I.,"The captain opened it, and found therein a beautiful cross of solid gold,"
2460,I.,curiously wrought and thickly studded with precious stones.
2461,I.,
2462,I.,"“Will it not do, monsieur? There was nothing else. No money. The woman"
2463,I.,"demanded so much for the room and all! Poor mamma was so long sick! Oh,"
2464,I.,"monsieur, monsieur, but for that—if she had not been sick, she also would"
2465,I.,"have come to America—to Julien! ‘Take it,’ she said—all so slow—she"
2466,I.,whispered it all so slow—‘Take it and go to Julien. It will pay the
2467,I.,passage.’ And she whispered still a little more. I could not hear. But
2468,I.,"I thought she went to sleep. When the morning came, and I could see her"
2469,I.,face—so pale! so cold! so still—”
2470,I.,
2471,I.,"“Here, my little Julie,” interrupted the captain, pressing his hand an"
2472,I.,"instant over his eyes, “take thy cross. Keep it. Thou shalt have it to"
2473,I.,remember her by. And I—I am very well pleased to have a little passenger.”
2474,I.,
2475,I.,"“Oh, mon oncle! how good you are!” and the child covered his great brown"
2476,I.,hand with kisses.
2477,I.,
2478,I.,The captain stooped to rub her soft cheek with his grizzled beard.
2479,I.,
2480,I.,"He had no reason to be surprised; for wherever he went, the wide world"
2481,I.,"over, did not all children call him “Uncle?”"
2482,I.,
2483,I.,
2484,II.,II.
2485,II.,
2486,II.,"“When was it your brother went away, Julie?—how long ago? can you"
2487,II.,remember?” the captain asked one day as the little girl paced the deck at
2488,II.,"his side, her slender hand in his."
2489,II.,
2490,II.,"“It is a very long time, monsieur mon oncle,” she answered; and after"
2491,II.,"thinking, “it is a year.”"
2492,II.,
2493,II.,"“Now try to remember, if you can, something about the place where he"
2494,II.,lives. Did he never tell you about it?—did he write no letters?”
2495,II.,
2496,II.,"“Oh, yes, mon oncle; often to our mother, and for me, one time, a little"
2497,II.,letter—all in an envelope by itself. Always I carry it with me. Behold
2498,II.,"it!” she said, drawing it from her pocket."
2499,II.,
2500,II.,"“Ah! a letter!” cried the captain, greatly relieved, “that will help us.”"
2501,II.,
2502,II.,"It was dated six months before, and postmarked “Philadelphia.” Within,"
2503,II.,"too, was given the name of the street, and even the number of the"
2504,II.,residence.
2505,II.,
2506,II.,"“Ah!” gasped the captain, more relieved than ever."
2507,II.,
2508,II.,"As soon as the vessel arrived in port, he addressed some lines to"
2509,II.,"Julie’s brother. But as the days passed and he received no answer, he"
2510,II.,"went himself to Philadelphia, and to the street and number given in"
2511,II.,"the letter. No. 210 proved to be a boarding-house, where, indeed, the"
2512,II.,"person inquired for had stopped a short time. He had, however, gone away"
2513,II.,"long ago, whither, no one could tell. The captain then inserted in the"
2514,II.,newspapers a card asking information concerning his whereabouts. While
2515,II.,"waiting a reply, there came orders to sail with a cargo for the West"
2516,II.,"Indies. (The captain’s was a trading vessel, carrying merchandise from"
2517,II.,one country to another.)
2518,II.,
2519,II.,What was to be done with little Julie? that was the question. The captain
2520,II.,"went finally to a lawyer, told him her story, charged him to make"
2521,II.,"inquiries for her brother. Then they talked awhile together, and the"
2522,II.,lawyer did some writing.
2523,II.,
2524,II.,After that the captain took Julie in the cars to a town where lived a
2525,II.,"friend of his. Now, his friend, his wife, and their five children were"
2526,II.,delighted to see the captain. They always were when he came home from
2527,II.,his voyages. Perhaps it was because he never failed to bring such costly
2528,II.,presents; this time a beautiful gilt harness for the father—or rather for
2529,II.,"a pair of fine bays—elegant French silks for the mother, and no end of"
2530,II.,"toys for the small folks. And when he asked Mrs. Lane if she would, as a"
2531,II.,"favor, take Julie into her home and care for her until his return (he did"
2532,II.,"not expect to be gone long, he said), she appeared to be very willing to"
2533,II.,do so.
2534,II.,
2535,II.,"But when it came to bidding “good-bye,” and the child clung to him,"
2536,II.,"trembling and sobbing, “Oh, mon oncle! mon oncle!” he looked troubled. He"
2537,II.,"just held her close for a moment, gave her three great sailor kisses that"
2538,II.,"echoed from cellar to garret, and ran out of the house without a word."
2539,II.,
2540,II.,No sooner had the captain’s ship set sail than Mrs. Lane took Julie to an
2541,II.,orphan asylum.
2542,II.,
2543,II.,"“Send her off somewhere,” she said to the matron. “A home in the West!"
2544,II.,"that would be the very place for her. Ah, the West! what a glorious place"
2545,II.,for little homeless wanderers!”
2546,II.,
2547,II.,"Riding away alone in her easy carriage, she muttered:"
2548,II.,
2549,II.,“The _i_dea of his bringing that little vagabond for _me_ to look after!
2550,II.,I don’t care if he _did_ offer to pay her board (of course it wouldn’t
2551,II.,have done to accept). I don’t intend to make my house a harbor for every
2552,II.,"little straggler that happens along! and right there with the children,"
2553,II.,"too! What do I know about her? What does he? Maybe her story is true, and"
2554,II.,"maybe it isn’t. Those French, they can lie! And then she’d be forever"
2555,II.,harassing me about that brother of hers. Ha! she’ll never see _him_
2556,II.,"again! those French!... And then he’s taken such a fancy to her!—why,"
2557,II.,she calls him ‘Uncle’ already! Just like him to go and spend upon her
2558,II.,"the half he owns—educate her, and all that! I won’t have it!... There may"
2559,II.,"be some trouble over my sending her off?... Well, well, I’ll have some"
2560,II.,pretty excuse ready. Time enough to invent it before he gets back.”
2561,II.,
2562,II.,"(It was thought that the captain would make the little Lanes his heirs,"
2563,II.,for they were great favorites with “Uncle Jack.”)
2564,II.,
2565,II.,
2566,III.,III.
2567,III.,
2568,III.,"At the asylum, little orphans had a roof to shelter them from the storms,"
2569,III.,"a place to lay their tired selves at night, food to eat when they were"
2570,III.,"hungry, clothes to protect them from the cold. But there was no mamma"
2571,III.,"there, no Julien, no oncle le capitaine. The great clean rooms, with"
2572,III.,"their whitewashed walls, were so bare. No pretty mats on the floors,"
2573,III.,"no carved tables, no silken chairs and sofas, no crimson curtains, no"
2574,III.,"beautiful paintings and statuettes, as in that pleasant village home from"
2575,III.,which Julie and her mother fled when the terrible armies came marching
2576,III.,"on, with beat of drum and thundering of cannon. It was dreary and"
2577,III.,"lonesome here. Julie could not understand a word that was spoken, neither"
2578,III.,could any one understand her. So she could not play with the other
2579,III.,"children, but sat alone by herself watching them all day—watching in a"
2580,III.,"dream, the roar of the briny billows still ringing in her ears. Now and"
2581,III.,then she cried a little for very homesickness; and always she wondered
2582,III.,why she was in this place and why Julien did not come.
2583,III.,
2584,III.,"One day a lady was shown into the school-room, where the children sang"
2585,III.,for her. Looking about upon their faces she asked:
2586,III.,
2587,III.,"“Who is that delicate little creature in the corner, with the dark hair"
2588,III.,and eyes?”
2589,III.,
2590,III.,"The matron told the story she had heard from Mrs. Lane. It was, she said,"
2591,III.,a little orphan girl who had recently come over in an emigrant ship from
2592,III.,France. Her father was killed in the battle of Sedan. Did the lady know
2593,III.,of any one who would like to adopt the child?
2594,III.,
2595,III.,"“Why, I’ve a great mind to take her myself. She could play with Charlie"
2596,III.,"and Lizzie, you know,” turning to her companion, “and in that way they"
2597,III.,"could learn to speak French, couldn’t they?”"
2598,III.,
2599,III.,"So, when this person—she was visiting some cousins in town—when she"
2600,III.,"returned home Julie went with her; why, she did not know, but she"
2601,III.,"supposed it must be the way to find her brother. To be sure, madame let"
2602,III.,"her hold Lizzie a good deal, and holding Lizzie made one’s arms ache."
2603,III.,"What matter? Julien would be there, where they were going!"
2604,III.,
2605,III.,"But when the long journey was ended, and they left the noisy train, and"
2606,III.,"monsieur met them, all smiles at the sight of wife and baby, and they"
2607,III.,"drove through the streets to monsieur’s house, Julien was not there! The"
2608,III.,child was ready to cry from disappointment. She sat down by the window
2609,III.,"and watched the passers-by. Perhaps one would be Julien. Now, a little"
2610,III.,"boy of five or six years, after being fondled and caressed by mamma, and"
2611,III.,"having given baby a dutiful but hasty kiss, came and planted himself in"
2612,III.,"front of her. When he had stared at her to his satisfaction, he demanded:"
2613,III.,
2614,III.,“Who be _you_?”
2615,III.,
2616,III.,"Julie could not understand, and so how could she answer?"
2617,III.,
2618,III.,"“Who be _you_, I say?”"
2619,III.,
2620,III.,No reply.
2621,III.,
2622,III.,"“Why don’t you speak, you ninny, you?”"
2623,III.,
2624,III.,"“Bonjour, mon ami,”[2] said Julie, scared at his rough tones."
2625,III.,
2626,III.,"“Bonny Jew!—what’s the rest of it? Bonny Jew! Bonny Jew! Ha, ha! What a"
2627,III.,funny name!”
2628,III.,
2629,III.,Charley caught up his cap and ran into the street to tell Willie Wade:
2630,III.,
2631,III.,"“There’s a girl in there. Her name’s Bonny Jew. She’s deef, I guess, fur"
2632,III.,I couldn’t make ’er hear till I hollered loud enough to take ’er head
2633,III.,off.”
2634,III.,
2635,III.,"At night, madame led Julie down to the kitchen, saying, “Katrine, you may"
2636,III.,"let her sleep with you,” and left her there."
2637,III.,
2638,III.,"Katrine’s face flushed scarlet, and her mild eyes flashed as they never"
2639,III.,flashed before. Was not France at that very hour making war upon her
2640,III.,"countrymen? Were not all French, then, her enemies? She took up the lamp"
2641,III.,"and strode toward her chamber. Julie, afraid to be left in the dark,"
2642,III.,followed after. The door was locked in her face.
2643,III.,
2644,III.,"Madame coming into the basement for a glass of water, late in the"
2645,III.,"evening, stumbled over the child lying asleep on the hall floor, just"
2646,III.,"outside of Katrine’s room. She tried the door, and finding it fastened,"
2647,III.,called through the keyhole: “Katrine! Katrine!”
2648,III.,
2649,III.,Katrine either did not hear or pretended not to. She was snoring right
2650,III.,loyally between two immense feather beds which had kept her company all
2651,III.,"the way from Vaterland. The lounge in the back parlor, with some shawls"
2652,III.,"and cushions, would serve for Julie’s couch this time."
2653,III.,
2654,III.,"“Katrine,” asked madame, “what did you mean by locking Julie out of your"
2655,III.,room last night?”
2656,III.,
2657,III.,“I vill not haf der Franchen mit me in my ped!”
2658,III.,
2659,III.,"“Why, Katrine, I think you are very unreasonable.”"
2660,III.,
2661,III.,“I care not vat you tinks! I vill go find me anodder blace!”
2662,III.,
2663,III.,But madame couldn’t afford to lose Katrine. Katrine was a treasure.
2664,III.,"Katrine could cook, and wash, and iron, and do all kinds of work"
2665,III.,"to perfection. She was tidy, and she was industrious, and always"
2666,III.,"good-tempered till now. So, instead of her finding “anodder blace,” a"
2667,III.,"bed was made for Julie in the attic—the low, wide, windowless attic,"
2668,III.,"where not a breath of air moved in summer, where the winds whistled"
2669,III.,"and moaned in winter, where the rats and mice held revels all the year"
2670,III.,"round—the great, gloomy attic, with its mysterious chests and closets,"
2671,III.,"where curious shadows dwelt; strewn with mysterious hats, and boots and"
2672,III.,"shoes, that took strange shapes after the sun went down; hung about with"
2673,III.,"mysterious outcasts—old gowns, and crinolines, and coats, that weirdly"
2674,III.,"swayed and swung on boisterous autumn nights; the dreadful attic, where,"
2675,III.,"hour after hour, when she ought to have been enjoying sweet, blessed"
2676,III.,"sleep, little tired Julie lay wide-eyed, staring at—she knew not what,"
2677,III.,"listening to—she knew not what, trembling, shivering, the sweat upon her"
2678,III.,brow.
2679,III.,
2680,III.,"“Oh, madame, _j’ai peur_!”[3] she said once, lingering when bedtime came."
2681,III.,
2682,III.,But madame didn’t understand.
2683,III.,
2684,III.,The weeks passed by. Julien did not come. Would he ever come? The
2685,III.,question was often put to madame. But she didn’t understand. Julie began
2686,III.,"to grow discouraged. Baby was so heavy! and she was cutting teeth, too,"
2687,III.,and worried and fretted. Some new plaything must be invented every five
2688,III.,"minutes to amuse and keep her quiet. She must be sung to, rocked, carried"
2689,III.,"backward and forward, to and fro, drawn in her carriage up and down the"
2690,III.,"sidewalk, wearily, wearily, up and down. As for Charley, he learned"
2691,III.,to speak less good French of Julie than he hurled bad English at her.
2692,III.,"During his mother’s visit East, he had improved the chance for making"
2693,III.,"acquaintance with all the boys on the street, and thus had considerably"
2694,III.,"increased the list of words at his command. One day, Lizzie’s dimpled"
2695,III.,fingers found the ribbon about Julie’s neck. Out in full sight flew the
2696,III.,"precious cross. Julie hastened to hide it, but a pair of keen eyes had"
2697,III.,caught the glitter.
2698,III.,
2699,III.,"“What’s that? What’s that shiny thing you’ve got there, Julie? I want to"
2700,III.,"see it!” cried the tormentor, darting toward her."
2701,III.,
2702,III.,She thrust out her hand to keep him off. He flung it aside and clutched
2703,III.,at the ribbon.
2704,III.,
2705,III.,"“Non! non!” she screamed, pushing him away."
2706,III.,
2707,III.,"At that he became furious, kicking and biting, and pulling her hair."
2708,III.,"Julie, dropping the baby, shrieked with pain. Baby began to cry lustily."
2709,III.,"The uproar reached the drawing-room, where there were callers. Madame"
2710,III.,"came rushing in to still the noise. Charley, who had succeeded in tearing"
2711,III.,"it away, now, triumphant, held up the cross."
2712,III.,
2713,III.,"“See, ma, see! She had it hid in ’er neck! She stole it, you bet!”"
2714,III.,
2715,III.,"“Oh, donnez-la moi! donnez-la moi!”[4] sobbed Julie."
2716,III.,
2717,III.,Madame hadn’t time to inquire into the matter. She took the cross away
2718,III.,"from Charley, though he stoutly resisted, locked it in a drawer of her"
2719,III.,"writing-desk, put the key in her pocket and then went back to her guests."
2720,III.,
2721,III.,The young gentleman picked at the lock with his pencil.
2722,III.,
2723,III.,"“You plagued old thing!” he muttered, shaking his fist and scowling at"
2724,III.,"Julie, “if you hadn’t a’ raised such a rumpus she’d never a’ knowed, and"
2725,III.,I’d a’ traded it off fur Tommy Tough’s pearl-handled penknife—plague take
2726,III.,you!”
2727,III.,
2728,III.,"After the visitors had gone, Julie, pointing to the writing-desk,"
2729,III.,entreated:
2730,III.,
2731,III.,"“Oh, madame, la give, la give! à present, s’il vous please!”"
2732,III.,
2733,III.,"“Yes, yes, yes, by and by.”"
2734,III.,
2735,III.,"But “by and by,” madame had forgotten. She did not remember, indeed,"
2736,III.,until she opened the drawer to get her portemonnaie before going out
2737,III.,shopping.
2738,III.,
2739,III.,"“Some cheap gew-gaw, possibly,” she thought, taking up the cross. “I"
2740,III.,"don’t know, though! Can this be glass? Wonder how she came by it? Can"
2741,III.,it possibly be of any value?... I’ve a great mind to take it down to
2742,III.,Forsyth’s and see what he says. _He_’ll know the moment he lays eyes on
2743,III.,it.”
2744,III.,
2745,III.,Down to Forsyth’s she took it.
2746,III.,
2747,III.,"“Mr. Forsyth,” she said, handing it across the counter, “here is a little"
2748,III.,trinket that has accidentally come into my possession lately. I’d like
2749,III.,your opinion as to its worth.”
2750,III.,
2751,III.,"The jeweler’s eyes sparkled like the precious gems, as he held them to"
2752,III.,the light.
2753,III.,
2754,III.,"“Why, Mrs. ——, you have here a treasure! Those stones!—genuine article!”"
2755,III.,and examining more closely: “It’s very old. Just observe the chasing. You
2756,III.,know nothing of its history?”
2757,III.,
2758,III.,"“No. You consider it of value, then?”"
2759,III.,
2760,III.,"“Of value? I would give five hundred dollars any day, Mrs. ——, to become"
2761,III.,"possessor of that cross.” He added eagerly, “Could you not be induced to"
2762,III.,part with it?”
2763,III.,
2764,III.,Five hundred dollars! Madame’s glance fell upon a silver tea-service
2765,III.,which she had long coveted.
2766,III.,
2767,III.,"“Possibly. I’ll think about it,” she said, and went her way."
2768,III.,
2769,III.,Such a lovely blue moire in one of the shop windows—five dollars a yard.
2770,III.,It made one’s mouth water to look at it. Such a lovely Brussels in
2771,III.,"another!—the parlors needed carpeting anew. Such lovely, lovely things in"
2772,III.,"all the windows! that one really _ought_ to have. As for the child, of"
2773,III.,what earthly use could that costly trinket ever be to _her_? Like as not
2774,III.,"she stole it, as Charley said."
2775,III.,
2776,III.,When madame reached home her purse was even better filled than when she
2777,III.,"started out, and the silver tea-set would be sent up from Forsyth’s"
2778,III.,to-morrow. Meantime a curious piece of workmanship in the jeweler’s
2779,III.,show-case was attracting much attention.
2780,III.,
2781,III.,*       *       *       *       *
2782,III.,
2783,III.,What a queer way to find the brother is this—tending Lizzie and being
2784,III.,"knocked about by Charley, and robbed of mamma’s last gift! Julie fears"
2785,III.,"she will never get it, for when she asked madame for it again, madame"
2786,III.,blushed and did not reply. What strange people these Americans are! They
2787,III.,make little children take care of little children! And she is afraid
2788,III.,of Charley. She trembles now to think of him. And who is that creature
2789,III.,peering out of the closet over there?
2790,III.,
2791,III.,It is like the woman who let the room where mamma was taken sick.
2792,III.,
2793,III.,"Why, this is that room! and here is the mother beside her."
2794,III.,
2795,III.,Julie leans over and asks:
2796,III.,
2797,III.,"“Why dost thou not waken, my mother? Behold, the sun is high. Why dost"
2798,III.,thou sleep so long? Why art thou so cold and pale? Mamma! Mamma!”
2799,III.,
2800,III.,The silken lashes are not lifted from the marble cheek; the white lips
2801,III.,make no answer.
2802,III.,
2803,III.,"“She is so weary, I will not disturb her. I will watch until she wakens.”"
2804,III.,
2805,III.,"The morning creeps away, the noon, and the afternoon, and now the evening"
2806,III.,comes.
2807,III.,
2808,III.,“Mamma! my dear mamma!”
2809,III.,
2810,III.,"Still the eyelids are not lifted, and the white lips are dumb."
2811,III.,
2812,III.,"The night goes by, and a day, and another night, and the morning dawns"
2813,III.,once more. And again the woman comes peering through the door.
2814,III.,
2815,III.,"“She is dead,” Julie hears her say."
2816,III.,
2817,III.,Men enter and carry the mother away.
2818,III.,
2819,III.,“Where are you going with my poor mamma?”
2820,III.,
2821,III.,“We are going to bury her.”
2822,III.,
2823,III.,"“You shall not bury her! You shall not take her away,” cries Julie."
2824,III.,
2825,III.,They thrust her back with rough hands. They will not let her follow. The
2826,III.,"woman locks her in. She is left alone, alone."
2827,III.,
2828,III.,"The day goes by, the noon, and the afternoon. The shadows reach out after"
2829,III.,"her like claws. She crouches in the chimney-corner, staring at them"
2830,III.,"through the long, dark hours."
2831,III.,
2832,III.,"At midnight the woman glides stealthily in, glides stealthily about,"
2833,III.,"peering, peering with wicked eyes. She fumbles among the bedding, opens"
2834,III.,"the trunk, takes out its contents carefully."
2835,III.,
2836,III.,"“Nothing, nothing!” she hisses between clenched teeth."
2837,III.,
2838,III.,She glides stealthily towards the child. Julie holds the cross in her
2839,III.,hand.
2840,III.,
2841,III.,"“What have you there, little wretch?” demands the woman, trying to wrest"
2842,III.,it from her.
2843,III.,
2844,III.,"Julie will not give it up. With a sudden bound she escapes, runs out"
2845,III.,"of the room, out of the house, down the path, away, away, through the"
2846,III.,"fields. On, and on, she hurries, not daring to look back. Daylight comes,"
2847,III.,and still she walks on. After awhile she grows faint. She sits down by
2848,III.,the roadside to rest. A peasant girl passes by with a basket on her arm.
2849,III.,
2850,III.,“Does this road go to the place where one finds the ships?” asked Julie.
2851,III.,
2852,III.,"“Oui, mademoiselle.”"
2853,III.,
2854,III.,"When Julie is rested, she rises and walks on. Still on and on. The way"
2855,III.,is long. At last the houses are thick together. Beyond is the blue sea.
2856,III.,"There are the ships, many, with white sails."
2857,III.,
2858,III.,“Which one goes to America?” asks Julie of a man lounging about the wharf.
2859,III.,
2860,III.,He points to one from which floats a beautiful flag.
2861,III.,
2862,III.,"While she looks, the great flag comes fluttering, fluttering"
2863,III.,"down—fluttering, floating before her, floating about her, wrapping her"
2864,III.,"in its folds; then back it flies, whizzing through the air, up, up, up,"
2865,III.,"among the tall masts, so high above the water! Julie is dizzy, and tries"
2866,III.,to catch at the ropes. Lo! her hands are pinioned. She cannot move them.
2867,III.,A huge serpent is coiled about her—a huge serpent striped its whole
2868,III.,"length with red and white. The coils are tightening, tightening. She"
2869,III.,cannot breathe. She struggles to be free. A flaming head swoops suddenly
2870,III.,down. Two terrible eyes glare at her—two eyes—two glittering stars.
2871,III.,
2872,III.,"[2] Good-morning (or good-day), my friend."
2873,III.,
2874,III.,[3] I am afraid.
2875,III.,
2876,III.,"[4] Oh, give it to me! give it to me."
2877,III.,
2878,III.,
2879,IV.,IV.
2880,IV.,
2881,IV.,"“Katrine,” said madame, “go and call Julie. Why, here it’s seven o’clock,"
2882,IV.,and she not up yet! I never knew her to lie abed like this before. Tell
2883,IV.,her she must come down right away and dress the baby.”
2884,IV.,
2885,IV.,"Katrine came back in a few minutes, looking frightened."
2886,IV.,
2887,IV.,"“I calls von, dwo, dree dimes. She vill not hear. Den I goes oop der"
2888,IV.,shtep und calls von more dime. She vill not ondershtand. She shtare mit
2889,IV.,de eyes vide—und see notting! Den she schream like murter.”
2890,IV.,
2891,IV.,"“Why, mercy on us, Dolf!” exclaimed madame, glancing across the"
2892,IV.,"breakfast-table at her husband, “what if the child’s sick! some fever"
2893,IV.,or other!—something catching!—and these children!—she ought to be got
2894,IV.,"out of the house immediately!... St. Mary’s Hospital! Yes, that’s the"
2895,IV.,"place. She’s Catholic, I believe. Katrine!—no, wait! perhaps it isn’t"
2896,IV.,"anything serious, after all. We must find out first. Dolf, what if you"
2897,IV.,"leave word for Dr. Smith to call round as you go down street? No, stay!”"
2898,IV.,"in an undertone, “don’t send _him_. Get some one that doesn’t go in our"
2899,IV.,"set—some stranger. Being up in the attic so, it might get out that we"
2900,IV.,"didn’t treat her well. You know how absurdly people will talk, sometimes."
2901,IV.,Can’t you think of some one else we can call in?”
2902,IV.,
2903,IV.,"“Well, I d-o-n’-t know. Let me see. Why, yes, there’s that young fellow"
2904,IV.,"who has stuck up his shingle a few doors off from the office. Foreigner,"
2905,IV.,"I believe. Hasn’t any too much custom, should judge. Might get him.”"
2906,IV.,
2907,IV.,"“A foreigner. Oh, yes; that will do very well.”"
2908,IV.,
2909,IV.,In half an hour the young physician rang the door-bell. He was shown up
2910,IV.,"to the attic by Katrine. As he mounted the stairs, a pitiful little wail"
2911,IV.,came floating down:
2912,IV.,
2913,IV.,"“Oh, Julien, Julien, tu es bien longtemps à venir. Helas! ne te"
2914,IV.,reverrai-je plus?”[5]
2915,IV.,
2916,IV.,"Madame, waiting below, wondered if the stranger wasn’t “some exiled"
2917,IV.,"nobleman, he looks so distinguished. Rather seedy, though.”"
2918,IV.,
2919,IV.,Soon she grew impatient.
2920,IV.,
2921,IV.,"“What is he keeping me so long in suspense for, I should like to know?”"
2922,IV.,
2923,IV.,"When he came down at last, his eyes burned like hot coals, and he had"
2924,IV.,"for her questions never a word of answer. He walked swiftly away, and"
2925,IV.,returned with a carriage before she had recovered from her amazement.
2926,IV.,"Still speechless, he again made his way to the attic, and when he"
2927,IV.,descended this time he bore something in his arms very tenderly.
2928,IV.,
2929,IV.,"It was little Julie, wrapped in his cloak."
2930,IV.,
2931,IV.,"“You are behaving very strangely, sir! What are you doing? Where are you"
2932,IV.,taking her?”
2933,IV.,
2934,IV.,"“Where she will be cared for, rest assured!”"
2935,IV.,
2936,IV.,"“What do you mean, sir?” cried madame, following down the steps. “Do you"
2937,IV.,dare insinuate that she wouldn’t be cared for here? I want to know what

2939,IV.,
2940,IV.,"“The best right in the world, madame—a brother’s right.” To the coachman:"
2941,IV.,“Drive on!” and the carriage rolled away.
2942,IV.,
2943,IV.,"A passing glimpse of a tiny, fever-flushed face, wild, unconscious,"
2944,IV.,"restless eyes, and lips that moved continually, was the last madame saw"
2945,IV.,of the “delicate little creature” she had “adopted” for a nurse-girl.
2946,IV.,
2947,IV.,"When she had recovered breath and collected her scattered wits, she put"
2948,IV.,"on her shawl and bonnet, and went down town to the office."
2949,IV.,
2950,IV.,"“Dolf, what’s that young doctor’s name, do you know?”"
2951,IV.,
2952,IV.,"“Name? Never noticed, ’pon my word. Why?”"
2953,IV.,
2954,IV.,"“It’s out there on his door, or somewhere, isn’t it? Just step out and"
2955,IV.,"see, please.”"
2956,IV.,
2957,IV.,"“Leblanc,” said “Dolf,” returning."
2958,IV.,
2959,IV.,"“Leblanc—Leblanc ... yes, and that’s the child’s name, now I recall it."
2960,IV.,"Do you know, he’s her brother!”"
2961,IV.,
2962,IV.,The next place madame visited was the jeweler’s. She was very glad she
2963,IV.,"had not purchased the watered silk or the Brussels carpet, and that the"
2964,IV.,silver service had not yet been sent up to the house.
2965,IV.,
2966,IV.,"“Mr. Forsyth,” she said, laying a roll of bank-notes on the counter,"
2967,IV.,“I regret our little transaction yesterday. I prefer to keep the cross
2968,IV.,myself.”
2969,IV.,
2970,IV.,"“Well—a—hem!—a bargain’s a bargain, you know.”"
2971,IV.,
2972,IV.,"“Oh, don’t talk to me about ‘bargains’! we’re old acquaintances. I want"
2973,IV.,that cross. I _must_ have it.”
2974,IV.,
2975,IV.,"The jeweler colored, and coughed, and objected. But madame was obstinate."
2976,IV.,"Finally, as they were “old acquaintances,” and as madame’s husband"
2977,IV.,"was a lawyer, and as he hadn’t told her anywhere near the full value"
2978,IV.,"of the cross, he yielded—on one condition—that it should remain a few"
2979,IV.,"days longer in his show-case. It added greatly to the display there,"
2980,IV.,"especially since a card had been attached to it, reading thus:"

3095,V.,"hoped he was going to have a patient. But no, a tall, stout gentleman"
3096,V.,"strode into the office. His face was ruddy, his eyes twinkled merrily. He"
3097,V.,didn’t look as if he were in any need of medicine.
3098,V.,
3099,V.,"“I came to ask after the little Julie,” he said. “She came over in my"

3101,V.,
3102,V.,“Ah! is it ‘oncle le capitaine’?”
3103,V.,
3104,V.,"“The same,” answered the gentleman, smiling."
3105,V.,
3106,V.,“Then let me thank you for your kindness to my little sister!” cried the
3107,V.,"young man, grasping his hand. “I know not how to express my gratitude.”"
3108,V.,
3109,V.,“Bah! where is she?”
3110,V.,
3111,V.,“In the next room. She sleeps. She is just recovering from a fever—of the
3112,V.,brain.”
3113,V.,
3114,V.,“Indeed! Strange that woman should not have spoken of it! Has she been
3115,V.,very sick?”
3116,V.,
3117,V.,“It has been a struggle for life.”
3118,V.,
3119,V.,"“Ah-h-h, those Lanes! the rascals! Why, sir, I left the child in charge"
3120,V.,"of people I thought I could trust—people I had befriended. Why, that man,"
3121,V.,"Lane, was head and ears in debt! but for me, he and his would be in want"
3122,V.,"and misery to-day! What do they do, the moment I am out of sight, but"
3123,V.,send her to an orphan asylum! Sent her off! off West! that was all they
3124,V.,"could tell me at the asylum. Gone West! Nothing definite. No record, no"
3125,V.,"trace. I’ve had a search, I can tell you. Hunted, advertised, from place"
3126,V.,to place. Yesterday I came here. It was by this cross I found her. I saw
3127,V.,it in a shop window and identified it at once with one little Julie had
3128,V.,shown me on shipboard. You recognize it?”
3129,V.,
3130,V.,"“I do, indeed. It is an heir-loom. It has been handed down through I know"
3131,V.,not how many generations.”
3132,V.,
3133,V.,"“I made inquiries in the shop, and was directed to a lady who they said"
3134,V.,was its owner. She proved to be the person who took the child from the
3135,V.,asylum. She seemed strangely embarrassed and disinclined to speak about
3136,V.,the matter.”
3137,V.,
3138,V.,“With good reason! mon Dieu! my blood boils as I think of it. It was the
3139,V.,cruelty and overtask that caused my little one’s illness.”
3140,V.,
3141,V.,“I suspected something of the kind. Listen to the condition upon which
3142,V.,that person acquainted me with your whereabouts—that I ‘shouldn’t mention
3143,V.,the matter to any one in town!’ And there’s something wrong about this
3144,V.,"cross. She said she was afraid the child might lose it, and so had put it"
3145,V.,"under lock and key for safe keeping, and had afterwards lent it to the"
3146,V.,"jeweler as a curiosity. But he was wonderfully inquisitive, and undertook"
3147,V.,to pump me when I went back after it. What do you think he had labeled
3148,V.,it? As one of the jewels of your ex-Empress!”
3149,V.,
3150,V.,“C’en est trop![7] these Yankees!” exclaimed Julien; then coloring to the
3151,V.,roots of his hair he stammered:
3152,V.,
3153,V.,"“Pardon, monsieur!”"
3154,V.,
3155,V.,"“No offense,” said the captain, smiling. “I am, then, so genuine a"
3156,V.,Yankee?”
3157,V.,
3158,V.,"“I do not say it,” the other slowly answered."
3159,V.,
3160,V.,The captain laughed aloud.
3161,V.,
3162,V.,Julien opened the inner door.
3163,V.,
3164,V.,"“Didst thou call, sister?”"
3165,V.,
3166,V.,"“Oui, mon frere. Tell me who is with thee? But I know it—I! It is oncle"
3167,V.,le capitaine! I heard him laugh!”
3168,V.,
3169,V.,"“Bonjour, bonjour, mademoiselle l’Empress! how is your Majesty’s health"
3170,V.,"to-day?” cried a voice over Julien’s shoulder. “See, little pale one, I"
3171,V.,come to bring thee thy cross.”
3172,V.,
3173,V.,"“Oh, the cross of mamma! the cross of mamma!” exclaimed Julie, seizing it"
3174,V.,"and covering it with kisses, while silent tears crept down her wan cheeks."
3175,V.,
3176,V.,"Julien turned away to the window, and the captain sat down by the couch"
3177,V.,and shaded his eyes with his hand.
3178,V.,
3179,V.,"“But, mon oncle,” said Julie after awhile, “tell me, did you have a good"
3180,V.,voyage? Did the great waves come and tip the ship right over on its
3181,V.,side and almost spill you out? You were gone so long I feared you were
3182,V.,"drowned. Oh, mon oncle, do not go away again upon the terrible sea; but"
3183,V.,"stay with us, my brother and me.”"
3184,V.,
3185,V.,"“Ah, my little Julie, thy poor old uncle is, upon land, like a fish out"
3186,V.,of water.”
3187,V.,
3188,V.,"Julie must not yet hear, the captain thought, the story of that great"
3189,V.,"gale off the coast of the Carolinas, in which his good ship had nearly"
3190,V.,been wrecked. It would better suit the little convalescent to be told of
3191,V.,those islands where he had been; those sunny islands where it is always
3192,V.,"summer, where oranges and bananas and the rarest and most beautiful"
3193,V.,flowers grow wild.
3194,V.,
3195,V.,"While the two were talking, Julien once more took up his pen."
3196,V.,
3197,V.,“With monsieur’s permission. An article for the _Morning Post_. It must
3198,V.,be ready within the next two hours.”
3199,V.,
3200,V.,"“Ah!—a treatise on health, doubtless.”"
3201,V.,
3202,V.,“A treatise on Louis Napoleon—ce scelerat!”
3203,V.,
3204,V.,"“My friend, take the advice of your sister’s venerable uncle; let that"
3205,V.,"poor wretch alone. He’s about played out. At all events, you are out of"

3207,V.,at all trades is good at none.’”
3208,V.,
3209,V.,“But monsieur knows one must find some way to kill time.”
3210,V.,

3215,V.,
3216,V.,“Whew! is _that_ so? Why didn’t you tell me before?”
3217,V.,
3218,V.,"“Why be in haste to tell of it, monsieur? It is nothing to boast of,"
3219,V.,surely!”
3220,V.,
3221,V.,“Why? Because I can help you. I am going to help you. I intended to when
3222,V.,"I came here, if I found you were in need of it.”"
3223,V.,
3224,V.,“I have not said I was in need. I ask no one for help. What I ask for
3225,V.,is—work!”
3226,V.,
3227,V.,"“Young man, you are altogether too proud! You should take lessons of"
3228,V.,Young America! Young America isn’t afraid of the jingling of coin. Young
3229,V.,America doesn’t spurn a good offer. Young America would jump at the
3230,V.,"chance. But as for work, why, work will come to you if you only wait for"
3231,V.,it long enough. ‘Patient waiters are no losers.’”
3232,V.,
3233,V.,"“Wait, wait, wait! mon Dieu! and the child there!”"
3234,V.,
3235,V.,"“Yes, we must think of her! Come, my dear fellow, you’ve had a hard row"
3236,V.,to hoe. No use denying!”
3237,V.,
3238,V.,Julien was silent for a few moments; then he said:
3239,V.,
3240,V.,"“I will confess, monsieur, that I have seen times when I have wished"
3241,V.,"myself well back in France. There, at least, one could fight for one’s"
3242,V.,country.”
3243,V.,
3244,V.,"“Is it worth fighting for? Poor France!—a republic, a kingdom, an empire,"
3245,V.,"a bedlam, by fits! ruled yesterday by an idiot, to-day by a lynx,"
3246,V.,"to-morrow by a pack of bloodhounds! Better off where you are, young man;"
3247,V.,better off where you are.”
3248,V.,
3249,V.,"Julien had arisen, and stood glaring at the captain."
3250,V.,
3251,V.,“Monsieur forgets he is speaking of the land of my birth!”
3252,V.,
3253,V.,"“And of the land of his birth, as well,” was the quiet reply."
3254,V.,
3255,V.,“Quoi! what do I understand monsieur to say?”
3256,V.,
3257,V.,“Have you never heard your mother speak of her brother Jean?”
3258,V.,
3259,V.,“Often.”
3260,V.,
3261,V.,“I am he.”
3262,V.,
3263,V.,“But no! He entered a monastery. He was a monk.”
3264,V.,
3265,V.,"“Still again, I am he. At your age I grew weary of the cloister."
3266,V.,Disguised as a sailor I escaped to the United States; and disguised as a
3267,V.,sailor I have knocked about the world ever since. My own country is the
3268,V.,one I avoid most of all. I suppose I never should have known aught of
3269,V.,Marguerite’s children if the little Julie had not come to me just as she
3270,V.,"did. Indeed, although she told me her name, I never suspected who she"
3271,V.,might be until she showed me her poor mother’s cross. In the cloister one
3272,V.,"is buried from the world. I did not know whom my sister married. He,"
3273,V.,"too, is dead, the child told me. I mean your father.”"
3274,V.,
3275,V.,"“General Leblanc, of the Italian campaign—you have never heard of him? It"
3276,V.,was there that he lost his life.”
3277,V.,
3278,V.,"“Poor Marguerite! She was coming to you, it seems, and fell ill upon the"
3279,V.,way.”
3280,V.,
3281,V.,“I first learned it from Julie. I had received no tidings for months. Our
3282,V.,"home was in the region which has fallen into the enemy’s clutches. Mails,"
3283,V.,"of course, were stopped. What other reason for the silence? Mon Dieu! the"
3284,V.,agony of suspense! I should have returned immediately when the republic
3285,V.,"was declared, if I could have seen my way—”"
3286,V.,
3287,V.,“And you two might have sought each other till your locks were gray—and
3288,V.,probably would never have met.”
3289,V.,
3290,V.,"“Mon oncle, please tell to me also those strange, sad things you have"

3292,V.,"till suddenly, at this moment, he looks frightened.”"
3293,V.,

3309,THE VOICES.,most musical.”
3310,THE VOICES.,
3311,THE VOICES.,Up from the dewy grass sprang a meadow-lark with a burst of melody that
3312,THE VOICES.,"thrilled the listening air; then loud, and sweet, and clear, was heard"
3313,THE VOICES.,"the warbling of a nightingale; the mountain brook, swinging its censer"
3314,THE VOICES.,"among the rocks, began to chant—in lower, deeper tones; meanwhile, that"
3315,THE VOICES.,"wanderer, the wind, passing, with nimble fingers touched the keys of the"
3316,THE VOICES.,"forest-organ, and the towering pines and sturdy oaks and yews quivered"
3317,THE VOICES.,and throbbed as he played accompaniment; then caroled in chorus countless
3318,THE VOICES.,millions of birds—even the tiny insects took to humming as they rioted
3319,THE VOICES.,"among the golden rays, and the wild beasts and every living creature,"
3320,THE VOICES.,"encouraged, lifted their voices in trial; from the cloud-mass, above the"
3321,THE VOICES.,"far-off horizon, came the thunder’s rumble; the river, leaping the cliff,"
3322,THE VOICES.,roared in rivalry; quick followed the heavy voices of the great billows
3323,THE VOICES.,"as they came surging upon the beach. Oh, grand and mighty music did they"
3324,THE VOICES.,all make together in that glad morning of the world. The sunlit heavens
3325,THE VOICES.,"leaned over, breathless, to hear it, the purple valleys, lifting, fondled"
3326,THE VOICES.,"it as they climbed, the speechless hills caught it up, and in envy hurled"
3327,THE VOICES.,"it back again, note by note, till the whole earth was wild with sound and"
3328,THE VOICES.,"deafening reverberation, and “Cease, cease, my children!” Dame Nature"
3329,THE VOICES.,"cried aloud, “lest I render you voiceless, every one, and there be no"
3330,THE VOICES.,more music forever.”
3331,THE VOICES.,
3332,THE VOICES.,"But failing to make herself heard, she unrolled the great cloud that"
3333,THE VOICES.,"lay coiled above the horizon, and drew it like a veil across the sky."
3334,THE VOICES.,"Immediately there was silence—silence unbroken for a moment’s space, when"
3335,THE VOICES.,"“Ha, ha, ha!” giggled the mountain brook, unable to restrain its mirth;"
3336,THE VOICES.,"“Ha, ha, ha!” repeated a bright-winged forest bird; “Ha, ha, ha!” flew"

3341,THE VOICES.,"silence by thine ill-timed laughter, laugh on, forever and forever: thy"
3342,THE VOICES.,"song is taken from thee, and thou shalt have thy fill of merriment! From"
3343,THE VOICES.,"thee, too, bird of the brilliant plumage, is taken the power of song:"
3344,THE VOICES.,henceforth thou shalt find voice only to mimic the folly of others. And
3345,THE VOICES.,"you, ye hills, will I fetter and bind, that ye no more astonish the world"
3346,THE VOICES.,with your envious wrath.
3347,THE VOICES.,
3348,THE VOICES.,"“As for you, my obedient children, ye are all musical, each in his own"
3349,THE VOICES.,"way; and now will I assign to you places in my choir. Thou, wandering"
3350,THE VOICES.,"wind, shalt be my organist; and ye larks and nightingales, who are my"
3351,THE VOICES.,"pride and joy, and all ye merry little birds, the melody is yours; and ye"
3352,THE VOICES.,"surging billows, and muttering clouds, and roaring cataracts, to you the"
3353,THE VOICES.,base belongs.
3354,THE VOICES.,
3355,THE VOICES.,"“Sing on, now, my children; sing on, and practice well, that ye may know"
3356,THE VOICES.,"your parts when, by and by, I call upon you for a grand and glorious"
3357,THE VOICES.,anthem that shall fill the world with wonder.”
3358,THE VOICES.,
3359,THE VOICES.,"And alway since then they have been diligently practicing, till now,"
3360,THE VOICES.,"when Dame Nature calls for _Te Deum_ at the day-dawn, or for a vesper"
3361,THE VOICES.,"hymn at eventide, marvelous is the melody of gleesome and gay-hearted"
3362,THE VOICES.,"little birds; marvelous is the skill of the musician wind, as he sweeps"
3363,THE VOICES.,the forest-organ’s answering keys; marvelous are the voices of cloud and
3364,THE VOICES.,"cataract, and marvelous the voices of the sea."
3365,THE VOICES.,
3366,THE VOICES.,"But there are birds of rainbow-tinted plumage, wonderful to behold, whose"
3367,THE VOICES.,"harsh, discordant tones serve only to mock and mimic; the mountain brook"
3368,THE VOICES.,"wearies ofttimes of laughter, querulous, complains to the rocks, grieving"
3369,THE VOICES.,for its lost song; and faint and rare are the echoes heard among the
3370,THE VOICES.,speechless hills.

3377,MOONSHINE.,
3378,MOONSHINE.,"Moonshine crept down, one clear, unclouded night, to look about the world"
3379,MOONSHINE.,"and see what was going on. In her hand she carried a silver lamp, by"
3380,MOONSHINE.,whose white rays all objects could be seen as plainly as at noontide;
3381,MOONSHINE.,"and wherever she went, the shadows, ashamed of their blackness, stole"
3382,MOONSHINE.,guiltily away and tried to hide themselves. Her path led through a forest
3383,MOONSHINE.,"and down a mountain side, where wild beasts roamed for prey; but now the"
3384,MOONSHINE.,"timid deer browsed securely among the underbrush, and the hungry bear"
3385,MOONSHINE.,"trudged supperless off to his den, the stealthy panther kept useless"
3386,MOONSHINE.,"watch from the branches overhead, the rattlesnake slid back into its hole"
3387,MOONSHINE.,"and left the tree-toads chirping cheerily, the sly fox found the rabbits"
3388,MOONSHINE.,too wide awake for him; for was not Moonshine abroad with her silver
3389,MOONSHINE.,"lamp, proclaiming to all harmless creatures: Here is your enemy, and"
3390,MOONSHINE.,there is your enemy?
3391,MOONSHINE.,
3392,MOONSHINE.,"On she passed till she came to a pioneer’s log cabin, standing alone in"
3393,MOONSHINE.,"the wide wilderness. Listening, she heard the sound of a voice singing:"
3394,MOONSHINE.,
3395,MOONSHINE.,"“Lullaby, lullaby, baby,"
3396,MOONSHINE.,"Lullaby, by, by,"
3397,MOONSHINE.,"While all the little stars twinkle,"
3398,MOONSHINE.,Twinkle up in the sky.
3399,MOONSHINE.,
3400,MOONSHINE.,"“Lullaby, lullaby, baby,"
3401,MOONSHINE.,"Lullaby, by, by;"
3402,MOONSHINE.,"Thy father has gone a journey,"
3403,MOONSHINE.,"And there’s only thou and I,"
3404,MOONSHINE.,"To rock, rock, to and fro,"
3405,MOONSHINE.,"And to watch, watch for the savage foe,"
3406,MOONSHINE.,"To sleep, sleep,"
3407,MOONSHINE.,"And to keep, keep"
3408,MOONSHINE.,"Watch for the savage foe,"
3409,MOONSHINE.,"While all the little stars twinkle,"
3410,MOONSHINE.,Twinkle up in the sky.”
3411,MOONSHINE.,
3412,MOONSHINE.,"“Ah,” said Moonshine, “the mother and her babe are alone and unguarded"
3413,MOONSHINE.,in that rude dwelling. Even as she sings her voice trembles with fear. I
3414,MOONSHINE.,will set my lamp in the window and pause awhile to keep her company.”
3415,MOONSHINE.,
3416,MOONSHINE.,"Instantly a soft radiance flooded the room within, and the mother,"
3417,MOONSHINE.,"looking up, beheld the gentle face peeping through the window. “Oh,"
3418,MOONSHINE.,"Moonshine,” she cried, with tears of joy, “how glad am I that you have"
3419,MOONSHINE.,"come! Stay with me a little, for I am lonesome; and tell me, pray, if"
3420,MOONSHINE.,there be any savages lurking about.”
3421,MOONSHINE.,
3422,MOONSHINE.,"Not far off a band of red men, their faces bedaubed with paint, and their"
3423,MOONSHINE.,"hair decked out with plumes, were gliding noiselessly through the dense"
3424,MOONSHINE.,"woods, thinking to steal upon the cabin unawares and destroy it and its"
3425,MOONSHINE.,"inmates. But as soon as they saw the silver lamp upon the window-sill,"
3426,MOONSHINE.,"they turned away, saying: “Moonshine is there! She would give warning of"
3427,MOONSHINE.,our approach.”
3428,MOONSHINE.,
3429,MOONSHINE.,"Moonshine, seeing that the dreaded enemy had turned aside, passed on"
3430,MOONSHINE.,and left the mother and her child sleeping peacefully. As swift she
3431,MOONSHINE.,"glided through valley and over hill, and across river and lake and"
3432,MOONSHINE.,"village-dotted plain, the rays of her glittering lamp reached far and"
3433,MOONSHINE.,"wide through the darkness, making the trees and gardens and rippling"
3434,MOONSHINE.,"corn-fields glad, pointing the shortest route to a weary boatman,"
3435,MOONSHINE.,"revealing to a belated traveler the robbers who stealthily pursued,"
3436,MOONSHINE.,looking in upon three rosy children who slumbered cosily in one couch
3437,MOONSHINE.,"together—stooping to kiss their shining curls and happy faces, and to"
3438,MOONSHINE.,whisper something pleasant in their ears. Nor did she pause when she came
3439,MOONSHINE.,"to the great sea, but glided on over the foaming billows. A white-sailed"
3440,MOONSHINE.,ship the winds were driving towards an unknown reef. Quickly she set her
3441,MOONSHINE.,silver lamp upon the perilous rock. Far over the angry waters shone the
3442,MOONSHINE.,"beacon light, and the mariners, seeing danger ahead, shifted their sails"
3443,MOONSHINE.,and changed the vessel’s course.
3444,MOONSHINE.,
3445,MOONSHINE.,"The wanderer reached, at length, a distant coast, and, holding her"
3446,MOONSHINE.,"lamp aloft, passed on from town to town. A student sat at midnight,"
3447,MOONSHINE.,wakeful among his books. Moonshine glanced over his shoulder at the
3448,MOONSHINE.,"closely-printed page, and the light of her silver lamp so put to shame"
3449,MOONSHINE.,"his miserable taper that he extinguished it, and began to write some"
3450,MOONSHINE.,verses in her praise.
3451,MOONSHINE.,
3452,MOONSHINE.,"At last, Moonshine peered down into a deep, dark dungeon, and saw a"
3453,MOONSHINE.,"hapless human creature bound with chains. Pale and wan he was, from long"
3454,MOONSHINE.,years of imprisonment. For hours she remained to speak to him comforting
3455,MOONSHINE.,words.
3456,MOONSHINE.,
3457,MOONSHINE.,"In the morning the pioneer came to his home on the mountain side, and"
3458,MOONSHINE.,told how he had been rescued by Moonshine from highwaymen who pursued him
3459,MOONSHINE.,"as he journeyed. “Ah, bless her,” said the wife; “for she also watched"
3460,MOONSHINE.,"over us, and guarded us while we slept.” The three rosy children awakened"
3461,MOONSHINE.,"smiling, and told one another their dreams; they had all dreamed of"
3462,MOONSHINE.,"fairy-land. The storm-tossed ship sailed into port, and the grateful"
3463,MOONSHINE.,"mariners declared that, but for Moonshine, they would have gone to the"
3464,MOONSHINE.,bottom of the sea. The student went about with such a beaming countenance
3465,MOONSHINE.,"that people questioned, Was he moonstruck? A jailer, descending into a"
3466,MOONSHINE.,"deep, dark dungeon, found the fettered captive lying silent, with closed"
3467,MOONSHINE.,eyes; and the sad soul that had gazed out of those eyes—who had set it
3468,MOONSHINE.,free? Moonshine?
3469,MOONSHINE.,
3470,MOONSHINE.,
3471,MOONSHINE.,
3472,MOONSHINE.,
3473,SUNSHINE.,SUNSHINE.
3474,SUNSHINE.,
3475,SUNSHINE.,
3476,SUNSHINE.,"“_Voila, Jeannette! voila!_”"
3477,SUNSHINE.,
3478,SUNSHINE.,The little old woman lifts her wrinkled face from the lace-work over
3479,SUNSHINE.,"which she is bending, and looks where the slender hand just pointed. How"
3480,SUNSHINE.,"did it come there, that sunbeam? So the two question; for never, in all"
3481,SUNSHINE.,"the time they have occupied the low, dim room, with its one window, has a"
3482,SUNSHINE.,"sunbeam shone into it, warm and cheery, like that. Possibly some recent"
3483,SUNSHINE.,alteration in the high buildings without has made way for the welcome
3484,SUNSHINE.,"visitor, now that the sun has moved farther around to the north. However"
3485,SUNSHINE.,"it came there, there it is, the mellow ray, deepening in color as the sun"
3486,SUNSHINE.,"sinks lower down, changing from yellow to orange, from orange to rose."
3487,SUNSHINE.,"The couch must be moved nearer, so that the thin hand may press the wall"
3488,SUNSHINE.,"and feel the warm light as it rests there; then a smile wreathes the wan,"
3489,SUNSHINE.,"weary young face, and its owner goes off dreaming—dreaming with eyes wide"
3490,SUNSHINE.,open.
3491,SUNSHINE.,
3492,SUNSHINE.,"Somebody knocks at the door. “Coom,” calls Jeannette. A lad of twelve"
3493,SUNSHINE.,lifts the latch and enters.
3494,SUNSHINE.,
3495,SUNSHINE.,"“Is this the place where they mend lace, ma’am?”"
3496,SUNSHINE.,
3497,SUNSHINE.,“Yes. _C’est moi._”
3498,SUNSHINE.,
3499,SUNSHINE.,"“Well, they sent a lot in this bundle. They said they wanted it done"
3500,SUNSHINE.,"right away, if you could. It’s a curtain. The kitten tore it, I guess."
3501,SUNSHINE.,He’s always scampering up the curtains.”
3502,SUNSHINE.,
3503,SUNSHINE.,“Yes.” (Yes is one of the few English words Jeannette is quite sure
3504,SUNSHINE.,"about, so she seldom adds to it in her replies, when she can avoid doing"
3505,SUNSHINE.,so.)
3506,SUNSHINE.,
3507,SUNSHINE.,“When shall I come after it?”
3508,SUNSHINE.,
3509,SUNSHINE.,"“Maunday—next—week,” Jeannette slowly answers, and takes the package the"
3510,SUNSHINE.,lad has brought.
3511,SUNSHINE.,
3512,SUNSHINE.,"His errand is done; why does he linger? Have the brown eyes, in a rapid"
3513,SUNSHINE.,"glance or two, taken in more than they would if they were not so big and"
3514,SUNSHINE.,"generous? The low ceiling with the laths bared of plaster here and there,"
3515,SUNSHINE.,"the scant furniture, the tumble-down stove, the uneven, uncarpeted floor,"
3516,SUNSHINE.,the plants in the window—sickly for lack of light—the withered little
3517,SUNSHINE.,"lace-mender shivering in her shawl for lack of fire, the boy on the couch"
3518,SUNSHINE.,"yonder, clutching at a sunbeam, gazing dreamily into space; he has seen"
3519,SUNSHINE.,"all; he has heard the hollow cough, he winks hard to keep from taking the"
3520,SUNSHINE.,decided shape of tears something that for an instant dims his bonny eyes.
3521,SUNSHINE.,
3522,SUNSHINE.,“Has he been sick a good while?” he whispers.
3523,SUNSHINE.,
3524,SUNSHINE.,"“Yes,” says Jeannette, and calls, “Ernest!”"
3525,SUNSHINE.,
3526,SUNSHINE.,"Ernest comes out of his dream. The great dark, sorrowful eyes meet the"
3527,SUNSHINE.,"great bright, generous ones. In a twinkling young America, with lusty"
3528,SUNSHINE.,"health and blooming cheeks, is at the bedside of—young France, shall we"
3529,SUNSHINE.,say?
3530,SUNSHINE.,
3531,SUNSHINE.,An hour after Ned hastens home to his sister with the story he has just
3532,SUNSHINE.,heard.
3533,SUNSHINE.,
3534,SUNSHINE.,"“Belle,” he cries, as he bursts into the parlor, “you know where you sent"
3535,SUNSHINE.,"me this afternoon—to that French woman’s? Well, they’re poor as can be."
3536,SUNSHINE.,"And he’s sick, too. And no doctor, no medicine, no nothing! Wish I was as"
3537,SUNSHINE.,rich as Crœsus!”
3538,SUNSHINE.,
3539,SUNSHINE.,“He? Who’s he?”
3540,SUNSHINE.,
3541,SUNSHINE.,"“Why, Ernest. His father was an artist, you see; and they came to this"
3542,SUNSHINE.,"country, and his pictures wouldn’t sell, and he couldn’t get work, and he"
3543,SUNSHINE.,"got discouraged and drowned himself. Then, after awhile, his mother died,"
3544,SUNSHINE.,and Jeannette—she’s a servant who came with them—she stays with him and
3545,SUNSHINE.,takes care of him. He’s got the consumption and coughs awfully. _I_ know
3546,SUNSHINE.,what’s done it! Starving! and freezing! Guess what he was doing! Warming
3547,SUNSHINE.,his hands in the sunshine!”
3548,SUNSHINE.,
3549,SUNSHINE.,"“Well, did she say when she would have the window curtain finished?”"
3550,SUNSHINE.,
3551,SUNSHINE.,Where shall one go for sympathy and help? There is no mother. The
3552,SUNSHINE.,"father is a hundred miles away, engaged as counsel in the settlement of"
3553,SUNSHINE.,a disputed estate (if anybody knows what all that means). The live-long
3554,SUNSHINE.,"night Ned lies awake, thinking the matter over something after this"
3555,SUNSHINE.,fashion:
3556,SUNSHINE.,
3557,SUNSHINE.,“There’s that house—corner of South and High Street. Rooms to let—noticed
3558,SUNSHINE.,the advertisement to-day. Nice rooms. Plenty of light. Just _the_
3559,SUNSHINE.,place!... Wish I was rich as Crœsus!... What did I want to go and throw
3560,SUNSHINE.,away my last allowance that way for? Haven’t got a red cent left! Don’t
3561,SUNSHINE.,"know where it’s all gone to, now! Got a lot of trinkets that aren’t of"
3562,SUNSHINE.,"much use to me, anyhow. Cut my thumb half off with my jack-knife first"
3563,SUNSHINE.,time I used it; broke all the strings to my violin before I’d had it a
3564,SUNSHINE.,week; and made myself about sick trying to smoke cigars.... Wish I was
3565,SUNSHINE.,rich as Crœsus!”
3566,SUNSHINE.,
3567,SUNSHINE.,"When, next morning, Ned meets on the street his elderly friend, the"
3568,SUNSHINE.,"physician, who helped him comfortably through with the measles, mumps and"
3569,SUNSHINE.,"whooping cough, and is greeted with, “Why, young man, there’s a cloud on"
3570,SUNSHINE.,"your face—what’s the trouble?” he answers, “Come and see,” and leads to"
3571,SUNSHINE.,"a dismal quarter of the town, and from one story to another of a dismal"
3572,SUNSHINE.,"tenement, till they reach the chamber where Ernest lies. When they are"
3573,SUNSHINE.,"down in the street again, Ned takes up the old refrain—"
3574,SUNSHINE.,
3575,SUNSHINE.,"“Wish I was rich as Crœsus. We’d get him out of there and cure him up,"
3576,SUNSHINE.,wouldn’t we?”
3577,SUNSHINE.,
3578,SUNSHINE.,"“Ah, my boy, if we had the wealth of twenty Crœsuses it’s too late"
3579,SUNSHINE.,to help him now. The best we can do is to make him as comfortable as
3580,SUNSHINE.,"possible where he is. Come round to the office with me, and I’ll give you"
3581,SUNSHINE.,something to ease the cough a little.”
3582,SUNSHINE.,
3583,SUNSHINE.,"When the medicine is ready Ned rises to go, but hesitates."
3584,SUNSHINE.,
3585,SUNSHINE.,"“There wasn’t any fire there, Doctor. I’ve used up all my last allowance,"
3586,SUNSHINE.,and father’s away from home. What’s to be done?”
3587,SUNSHINE.,
3588,SUNSHINE.,The Doctor writes down some names and addresses on a slip of paper.
3589,SUNSHINE.,
3590,SUNSHINE.,"“There. You go to these gentlemen, state the case, and we’ll see what"
3591,SUNSHINE.,they’ll do for you.... I might give you a recommend.... But no. We’ll
3592,SUNSHINE.,"try without, first. I fancy that honest face of yours will open the"
3593,SUNSHINE.,pocket-books quicker than any note from me.”
3594,SUNSHINE.,
3595,SUNSHINE.,"And Ned sets out on his first begging expedition, which proves"
3596,SUNSHINE.,so successful that in a few hours the tumble-down stove retires
3597,SUNSHINE.,"ignominiously to make place for a shining new one, in which the fire need"
3598,SUNSHINE.,"not go out while cold weather lasts; and the evening shadows, creeping"
3599,SUNSHINE.,"back to their favorite haunt, the attic, are amazed and panic-stricken to"
3600,SUNSHINE.,"find it occupied by a rosy troop of hilarious elfs, dancing up and down"
3601,SUNSHINE.,"the wall, with whom they must battle for possession."
3602,SUNSHINE.,
3603,SUNSHINE.,"Moreover, Ned has enlisted the sympathies of another of his particular"
3604,SUNSHINE.,"friends, Bridget, the cook, who fails not to prepare, daily, delicacies"
3605,SUNSHINE.,"for him to carry to the sick boy—glad of an errand thither, for this"
3606,SUNSHINE.,"new acquaintance is extremely interesting, not in the least like any"
3607,SUNSHINE.,"one Ned has ever met before, so young and yet so accomplished. Why, he"
3608,SUNSHINE.,"can give a hundred hints about playing on that precious violin, he can"
3609,SUNSHINE.,"show sheets of music of his own composing, a portfolio full of sketches,"
3610,SUNSHINE.,"his own work, in pencil and crayon and oil; and, oh! to hear him talk"
3611,SUNSHINE.,"of wonderful Paris, and of famous people whom he has seen and whom his"
3612,SUNSHINE.,father has known.
3613,SUNSHINE.,
3614,SUNSHINE.,"Perhaps a month has passed, when, upon an afternoon, Ned, bounding in all"
3615,SUNSHINE.,"aglow from the frosty air without, stops short, seeing the pallid face is"
3616,SUNSHINE.,not lifted in eager greeting from among the cushions.
3617,SUNSHINE.,
3618,SUNSHINE.,“Is he asleep?” he whispers.
3619,SUNSHINE.,
3620,SUNSHINE.,"“Yes,” sobs Jeanette."
3621,SUNSHINE.,
3622,SUNSHINE.,*       *       *       *       *
3623,SUNSHINE.,
3624,SUNSHINE.,"By and by as the lad turns slowly away, she places in his hands the"
3625,SUNSHINE.,"portfolio, saying;"
3626,SUNSHINE.,
3627,SUNSHINE.,“He tells me eet ees for you.”

3631,SUNSHINE.,"Belle, noticing her brother as he enters the house and hurries through"
3632,SUNSHINE.,"the hall on his way to his room, exclaims:"
3633,SUNSHINE.,
3634,SUNSHINE.,"“Why, Ned, you’ve been crying! What’s the matter?”"
3635,SUNSHINE.,
3636,SUNSHINE.,“Ernest is dead!”
3637,SUNSHINE.,
3638,SUNSHINE.,"“Who is Ernest?” inquires the father, lately returned, glancing up from"
3639,SUNSHINE.,his newspaper.
3640,SUNSHINE.,
3641,SUNSHINE.,When he has heard Ned’s story he asks to see the sketches. While he is
3642,SUNSHINE.,"examining them, Belle comes and looks over his shoulder. Suddenly she"
3643,SUNSHINE.,utters a little scream.
3644,SUNSHINE.,
3645,SUNSHINE.,"“Why, Ned, you darling! look here!”"
3646,SUNSHINE.,
3647,SUNSHINE.,"They have found, among the rest, a picture which Ned has not seen before."
3648,SUNSHINE.,"It brings tears to his eyes again, to Belle’s, too; the grim old lawyer’s"
3649,SUNSHINE.,"lips twitch for a moment, and he goes off and has the painting framed in"
3650,SUNSHINE.,"most costly style, and hangs it above the mantel in his study. Perhaps"
3651,SUNSHINE.,"it may serve as reminder of a bit of a sentence, spoken centuries ago,"
3652,SUNSHINE.,"which fortune-favored people, snuggling about the ingleside on boisterous"
3653,SUNSHINE.,"winter nights, are very apt to forget: “The poor ye have always with you.”"
3654,SUNSHINE.,
3655,SUNSHINE.,You may imagine the faithful Jeannette is not neglected. The sunniest
3656,SUNSHINE.,spot in the cemetery is where a marble cross tells you that Ernest is
3657,SUNSHINE.,"sleeping below. And the picture, what is it? It is a glimpse, in brown"
3658,SUNSHINE.,"and amber tints, of a wretched attic chamber with dilapidated ceiling,"
3659,SUNSHINE.,"and scant, worn-out furniture, and bare, uneven floor. And the only light"
3660,SUNSHINE.,there comes from the face peeping in through a door which stands ajar—a
3661,SUNSHINE.,"boyish face, round and merry, with ruddy cheeks, and big, heartful eyes,"
3662,SUNSHINE.,"and brown bits of curls clustering about the broad forehead—a frank,"
3663,SUNSHINE.,"open, cheery, winsome face. Now, away from the light which streams from"
3664,SUNSHINE.,"this face and into the sombre shadows, frightened demons are turning to"
3665,SUNSHINE.,"flee. And one of the demons whose gloomy features are partly visible, and"
3666,SUNSHINE.,"whose hand grasps a dagger, you may guess was meant for Despair. This"
3667,SUNSHINE.,"picture has a name. Ernest painted it underneath, in large letters of"
3668,SUNSHINE.,scarlet and gold. This is the name—SUNSHINE.

3681,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Feel well enough!” he answers gruffly, and then is sorry, and wishes he"

3686,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"neck, and smooths her sunny hair, as if to make amends. As for Rudolph’s"
3687,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"father, stern words spring to his lips; but suspecting what is the"
3688,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"trouble, he withholds them, only glancing up from his book with eyes so"
3689,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"full of unutterable sadness that the boy creeps guiltily out of the room,"
3690,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,and off to his chamber above.
3691,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3692,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,This is the trouble with Rudolph—he is haunted; haunted by a demon whose
3693,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,name is Discontent. It first appeared to him one evening in a certain
3694,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"elegant mansion on a certain fashionable avenue, whither he had been"
3695,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,sent with a message; for his father was to do some repairing there. In
3696,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the spacious, high-ceiled, oak-paneled library, where he waited to see"
3697,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the master of the house, this little demon stole up to him and whispered:"
3698,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3699,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Look at it—at all this splendor! these tall mirrors, and huge"
3700,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"chandeliers, and rich paintings, and carved cases of books! You never saw"
3701,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the like, did you?”"
3702,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3703,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"It followed him through the great hall with its marble floor and high,"
3704,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"arched entrance, followed him down the wide steps and out into the"
3705,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"street, whispering all the while, pointing back at the smooth front of"
3706,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"stone and the plate-glass windows; then, when they reached Rudolph’s"
3707,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"home, pointing scornfully at the humble cottage, and the entrance that"
3708,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"is neither high nor arched. It followed him in, this demon, into the"
3709,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,single apartment that is hall and library and kitchen combined. It sat
3710,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"down beside him in the corner. “Bah!” it muttered in disdain, “this"
3711,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,lounge can’t compare with that sofa where you rested just now. But wasn’t
3712,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"it soft, though!” It called his attention to all the objects around,"
3713,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sneering at the curtains because they are not of damask, at the floor"
3714,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"because it is uncarpeted, at the wall-paper because it is cheap. It"
3715,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"noticed Rudolph’s mother laying the table, and asked, “Do you imagine"
3716,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,that ladies who live in fine houses ever get supper themselves? Bah!
3717,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,don’t you believe it!” It noticed Rudolph’s father leaning back in his
3718,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"arm-chair with closed eyes, weary after the day’s labor, and queried, “Do"
3719,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"you suppose that gentleman you saw to-night ever gets tired, ever works?"
3720,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"No, of course he doesn’t. _He_ never wears work-clothes, shabby and worn"
3721,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"like that! He always goes dressed in broadcloth, and his purse is always"
3722,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"full, and he carries himself like a prince, and asks no odds of anybody."
3723,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And did you mind how he looked down at you, as if you were nothing but a"
3724,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,worm?—because your father’s only a carpenter! Wonder if he’ll treat _him_
3725,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,so? Bah! isn’t it wretched to be poor and to have to work!” And when
3726,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Rudolph took his place at the table, it was—“Bah! do you think gentlemen"
3727,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,ever eat anything so common as this?” and he pushed from him the simple
3728,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"food, untasted, and went back to his corner; and there he sat the whole"
3729,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"evening, and there he has spent every evening since, his face buried in"
3730,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"his hands, the demon whispering in his ear. For it has never left him;"
3731,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"no, not for a moment. It has followed him everywhere. In school, day"
3732,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"after day it kept up a continual buzzing, hindering him from getting"
3733,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"his lessons—he, the one who had always known them so well. It would"
3734,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,compare his own garments with those of one and another better clad than
3735,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"he. “And there’s Jesse James—see, he carries a gold watch!” “And isn’t"
3736,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,it mean for ’em to call you a ‘Dutchman!’ just because your father and
3737,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,mother came from Germany—though _you_ never lived there in your life—and
3738,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,because you’re poor and only a carpenter’s son. Pity your father couldn’t
3739,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"have been a count, or a baron, or something like that! How everybody"
3740,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"would have stared when he rode along in his glittering carriage, and how"
3741,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"everybody would have wanted to be friends, and would have asked him to"
3742,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"dinner, and all that! And how polite everybody would have been to _you_!"
3743,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"You wouldn’t have been a ‘Dutchman’ then; oh, not at all! And if he had"
3744,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"been a grand-duke, oh, think of it! How everybody would have gone down to"
3745,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the depot to meet him, and how people would have crowded around to shake"
3746,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"hands with him, and what a fuss they would have made over him—as they did"
3747,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"one winter when Alexis was here, you know, and you climbed up a lamp-post"
3748,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"to get a glimpse of him. Wasn’t he splendid, though! How grand it must be"
3749,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,to be the son of a Czar!”
3750,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3751,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"But during the Christmas holidays, now almost over, there has been no"
3752,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"school, and Rudolph has had nothing to do but the marketing, and keeping"
3753,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the walk before the house clear of snow, and running here and there about"
3754,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the city on errands for his father—who never has any vacation, the year"
3755,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"round. And all these days, oh, how that demon has tantalized him! It"
3756,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,would lead him through the market to where lay great heaps of turkeys
3757,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and geese and ducks, so plump and tempting, ready for the oven. “But"
3758,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"_you_ can’t buy any, they cost too much!” It would draw him close up to"
3759,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the bakery windows. “Wouldn’t Karl like one of those delicious cakes,"
3760,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"though! But you can’t buy it, it costs too much. Isn’t it too bad to"
3761,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"have to count the pennies so?” All the way down the street, of pleasant"
3762,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"afternoons, it would keep tormenting, pointing now at the richly-dressed"
3763,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"ladies out shopping: “Pity your mother can’t have velvets, and feathers,"
3764,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and furs, like that, and be fashionable!” now exclaiming: “Look! there"
3765,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,goes Jesse James. He’s taking his sister out for a sleigh-ride. Aren’t
3766,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"those horses just splendid! and that robe, look at it! it’s a real"
3767,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"tiger’s skin! and the bells, oh, how they jingle! By the way, did you"
3768,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"hear him telling one of the schoolboys, last week, about the Christmas"
3769,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,present he was going to give his cousin Florence?—a set of diamonds!
3770,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"think of it! Here are some, right here in this shop-window. Look at"
3771,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,them! see how they shine!... Pity _you_ can’t make somebody a Christmas
3772,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"present!—your cousin Mina, for instance. Pity _you_ can’t take somebody"
3773,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"out sleigh-riding. Never had a sleigh-ride yourself, for that matter."
3774,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Never had a ride any way, except in a street-car. Never had a single"
3775,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"chance to drive a horse, even.... What’s the reason some can have"
3776,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"everything they want, and others—oh! don’t it make you mad the way things"
3777,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,go on in this world?”
3778,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3779,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Yes, it does make him “mad.” He goes about glum and scowling. (He used"
3780,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"to be pleasant enough.) The ripple of his laughter is no longer heard,"
3781,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and he frolics no more with little Karl, who hardly dares approach him,"
3782,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,he is so cross. And thus it is that his mother is led to question if he
3783,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"is not well, and thus it is that his father comes to suspect what is the"
3784,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"trouble, and to guess the name of the demon that has crept in to disturb"
3785,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"their peaceful home, and to vex the bright, ambitious boy he is so proud"
3786,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"of. The book he is reading has lost its interest, for hours he scarcely"
3787,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,turns a page; and it is a great relief to lay it aside when the consoling
3788,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"little Karl, feeling that something is amiss, climbs sleepily into his"
3789,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,arms and lays a velvety cheek against his own.
3790,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3791,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Meanwhile, there is that wicked demon up-stairs upon the pillow, never"
3792,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"ceasing its poisonous whispering, till Rudolph, unable to shake off the"
3793,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"tormentor, at last gives way to sobs and tears, thankful that he is alone"
3794,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and in the dark, for he wouldn’t have so much as a ray of daylight catch"
3795,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,him crying.
3796,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3797,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Oh, Rudolph, is there no one to come to you here and drive away that"
3798,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"demon, by telling you of all the mighty ones who have risen from humbler"
3799,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"stations than yours—aye, climbed, round by round, up the ladder of"
3800,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"fortune till they reached the top, admired and applauded by the crowds"
3801,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,below—will no one comfort you by telling you of these?
3802,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3803,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Wait; here comes some one into the room, comes close to the bedside—a"
3804,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,stranger. Perhaps he has come for that.... But no; listen to what he says:
3805,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3806,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Arise, Rudolph, and accompany me to the palace of the Czar.”"
3807,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3808,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"The lad stares in amazement at the speaker—a tall, gaunt personage,"
3809,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"wrapped in a black mantle that almost touches the floor, and so conceals"
3810,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,the head and face with its ample folds that only the eyes are visible.
3811,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"What black, piercing eyes!—blacker than the mantle. Rudolph stares, and"
3812,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"then arises, obedient."
3813,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3814,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"The two travelers are not long in reaching their destination, and"
3815,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Rudolph soon finds himself in the imperial palace, in a great saloon,"
3816,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,magnificent beyond comparison with that oak-paneled library he saw some
3817,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"time ago. There is dancing here, and the glittering dresses of the"
3818,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"dancers dazzle him, and the music is so delightful it drives him nearly"
3819,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"wild. When finally he lifts his dizzy eyes from the whirling throng, he"
3820,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sees, sitting in state at the farther end of the apartment, one who he"
3821,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,concludes is the Czar; for all who approach him bow low and speak to him
3822,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,reverently.
3823,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3824,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Would Rudolph like to be Czar?” asks the personage in black.
3825,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3826,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“A-a-ah!” exclaims the other, smiling and clasping his hands."
3827,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3828,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Then bide your time.”
3829,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3830,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"They wait behind a heavy curtain till the music ceases, and the dancers"
3831,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"are gone, and the lights are extinguished, and the long saloon is dark"
3832,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,and empty. Then the muffled stranger leads through a maze of galleries
3833,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and corridors, unlocks, at length, a door, bids Rudolph enter, and"
3834,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Rudolph obeys. This apartment, also, is magnificent, but not so large as"
3835,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the other. At one side is a downy couch with golden-fringed drapery, and"
3836,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"there the great Czar reposes. Upon the wall, near, hangs a sword."
3837,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3838,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Take it down,” commands the personage in black; and Rudolph takes it"
3839,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,down.
3840,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3841,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Raise it,” is the second command, as they stand over the sleeping Czar;"
3842,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,and Rudolph raises on high the gleaming sword.
3843,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3844,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Strike!” And Rudolph strikes.
3845,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3846,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Now return it to its place and follow me.” And Rudolph returns the
3847,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"weapon, dripping, to its place upon the wall, and follows back through"
3848,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the long galleries and corridors, and down the marble stairs, and out and"
3849,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"away from the palace, and out and away from the city—away to a cave in"
3850,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the mountains. And the personage in black again commands, “Stay here and"
3851,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,bide your time.”
3852,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3853,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Day after day there come to them, in their hiding-place, rumors, now of"
3854,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the murder of the Czar, now of strife and difference among his subjects"
3855,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"over who shall be successor, and, finally, of an invasion by the"
3856,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"neighboring monarchs, who, seeing the people at war among themselves,"
3857,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,would profit by this opportunity to gain possession of the Empire.
3858,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3859,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Now is your time!” says the personage in black to Rudolph, and he leads"
3860,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"him into the midst of the battles, and teaches him so well the art of"
3861,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"warfare, that from the ranks he soon rises to be Field-Marshal. Then,"
3862,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the personage in black always secretly counseling, Rudolph (always"
3863,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"blindly obedient, he knows not why), following closely his instructions,"
3864,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"defeats the invading armies in every battle, drives them out of the"
3865,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Empire, pursues them into their own provinces, and returns triumphant;"
3866,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and the people greet him with loud rejoicing, and lead him to the great"
3867,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"throne-room, and robe him in the ermine-lined robe, and crown him with"
3868,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the jeweled crown, and shout till the echoes ring—“Hail, Rudolph, the"
3869,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Czar!” and, “Long live Rudolph, the Czar!”"
3870,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3871,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And again there are music and dancing; and it is Rudolph, now, who is"
3872,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"seated in state above the glittering throng, and all who approach him bow"
3873,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"low and address him reverently—excepting one—a tall, gaunt personage,"
3874,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"with muffled face, and piercing eyes, and long, black mantle, who steals"
3875,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"up behind him and whispers, “Does Rudolph enjoy being Czar?” And Rudolph,"
3876,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"remembering all, neither clasps his hands nor smiles."
3877,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3878,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"At midnight, as Rudolph lies upon the downy couch with its silken folds"
3879,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and golden-fringed drapery, suddenly waking from slumber, he sees one"
3880,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"standing over him with lifted sword; and he springs upon the assassin,"
3881,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and seizes his sword, and calls to the attendants, and has him put in"
3882,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"irons; and this man makes confession, and reveals to the Czar a plot"
3883,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,among the nobles against his life; then Rudolph causes some of those
3884,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"conspirators to be thrown into prison, and some to be beheaded; and,"
3885,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"for further safety, the guard in the palace is increased. But not long"
3886,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"after, again suddenly waking in the middle of the night, he sees another"
3887,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"standing over him with lifted sword; and he springs upon this one also,"
3888,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and seizes his sword, and calls to the attendants, and has him bound with"
3889,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"irons; and behold, when the lights are brought, this man is found to"
3890,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"be one of the palace guard; and he, too, makes confession, and reveals"
3891,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,to the Czar that all in the army are his foes and ready to take his
3892,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,life; then Rudolph sends out and causes some of the Generals and chief
3893,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"conspirators of the army to be imprisoned, and others to be beheaded;"
3894,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and, for further safety, he places his most faithful and trusty servant"
3895,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"to watch in his chamber while he sleeps. But a third time, suddenly"
3896,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"waking at midnight, he sees this servant standing over him with lifted"
3897,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sword; and him, too, he overpowers, and seizes the murderous weapon; and"
3898,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"this man, also, confesses; and from him the Czar learns that all in the"
3899,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,palace hate him and have plotted to take his life.
3900,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3901,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"So it comes to pass that Rudolph, the Czar, dares not close his eyes day"
3902,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"or night, for there is no one whom he can trust to protect him while he"
3903,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"slumbers. And as the weeks and months wear away, he grows so haggard"
3904,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"with watching, so weary for lack of sleep, that one morning, ere the"
3905,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sun has risen, and while all is hushed and silent, he casts aside the"
3906,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"robe of ermine, and the golden crown and sceptre, and steals away from"
3907,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the palace, and out through the palace garden, and off to the fields"
3908,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"beyond; and there, feeling secure, he lies down and closes his eyes, and"
3909,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"is just falling into a delicious slumber, when the sound of stealthy"
3910,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"footsteps arouses him, and looking up, behold one standing over him with"
3911,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"lifted sword; and he springs up to defend himself, but the other turns"
3912,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and flees. Then he goes on till he reaches a wide forest, and thinking,"
3913,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Surely no one will molest me here,” he lies down with a sigh of relief,"
3914,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and is just losing himself in sleep, when the howling of wolves disturbs"
3915,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"him, and he is obliged to hurry onward, to escape being torn in pieces by"
3916,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,those ferocious beasts.
3917,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3918,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"When he reaches the plain at the other side of the forest, he perceives,"
3919,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"at some distance, a group of huts, and saying, “Surely no one will know"
3920,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"me there,” he approaches them and asks for lodging, and is shown to a"
3921,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"rude chamber, where, just as he is about to lie down, he spies some"
3922,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"object crouching among the shadows, and moving toward it, behold, a"
3923,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,peasant armed with a glittering sword. And the wretched Czar departs
3924,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"in haste, saying, “My enemies are my own subjects;” and he pauses not"
3925,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,till he is far beyond the boundaries of his own realm. Now at last in a
3926,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"country ruled by another, thinking, “I am surely safe,” he throws himself"
3927,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"down by the wayside, faint and footsore; but just as sweet sleep is"
3928,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"stealing over him, listen—a rustling, and look—a highwayman standing near"
3929,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"with lifted sword; and he wearily moans, and, rising, hastens away."
3930,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3931,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"At length he comes to a great city, and saying, “Surely none will know"
3932,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"me or wish to harm me here,” he finds lodgings for the night, and lays"
3933,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"himself down to rest, when lo! one approaches softly with lifted sword,"
3934,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and Rudolph, the Czar, recognizes the face of him he saw in the field"
3935,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"beyond the palace garden. “Alas, he has followed me hither!” he cries,"
3936,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,and hurriedly leaves the city.
3937,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3938,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And so, wherever he goes, he dares not sleep, either from fear of"
3939,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"assassins, or of highwaymen, or of wild beasts. And so he wanders, and"
3940,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"ever wanders on. And one day as he drags himself along, seeking a place"
3941,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"to rest, he stops to drink from a fountain beside the path, and as he"
3942,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"kneels over the smooth, mirror-like waters, he discovers that his locks"
3943,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"are very white, and that his garments are thread-bare and torn. Still"
3944,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"onward and onward he journeys, sleep the one thing that he longs for."
3945,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3946,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"At last, as he emerges from the shadows of a dark defile between high"
3947,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"mountains, he lifts his heavy, drooping eyelids, and beholds, spread"
3948,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"out beyond, a valley far lovelier than any he has seen in all his"
3949,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,journeyings. Slowly and gently it climbs up and into the purpling
3950,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"distance, with other valleys stepping down between the hills to meet it,"
3951,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and little hamlets nestling at the feet of those hills. And he says,"
3952,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Surely in so peaceful a valley nothing can disturb me. I will get me to
3953,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"one of those villages and inquire for an inn, and there I will rest—there"
3954,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"I will sleep, sleep, sleep.”"
3955,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3956,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,But just where the defile opens into the valley he encounters an armed
3957,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sentinel, who steps forward and asks for his pass."
3958,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3959,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“I have no pass,” he answers."
3960,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3961,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Then thou canst not enter.”
3962,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3963,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“But I am no common man. I am great, and famous, and much feared.”"
3964,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3965,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“That matters not. Thou hast no pass. I may not let thee enter.”
3966,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3967,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“But hark you! I am Czar of all the Russias.”
3968,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3969,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Whatever or whoever thou art, thou hast no pass; therefore our King"
3970,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,knows thee not; I may not let thee enter. Answer me no more.”
3971,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3972,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And Rudolph, the Czar, complaining bitterly, crawls a little way off"
3973,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and casts himself down among the rocks. While he lies there, peering"
3974,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"wistfully into the beautiful valley, wondering at the blueness of the"
3975,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"heavens and the softness of the light, listening to the gurgling of"
3976,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"waters, and catching glimpses of cataracts flashing down the distant"
3977,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"hills, under overhanging branches—while he lies there, one, haughty, and"
3978,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"bearing himself like a prince, draws near, and Rudolph remembers to have"
3979,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"met him in a spacious, oak-paneled library, long ago, when he, the Czar,"
3980,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,was a boy.
3981,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3982,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"No sooner does this one reach the entrance to the valley, than the"
3983,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sentinel appears as before, and demands his pass. The other hands him a"
3984,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"paper, which he examines, and pronounces to be worthless. “It bears not"
3985,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"our King’s signature, but that of his worst enemy. Begone, impostor!”"
3986,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3987,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“But I am a millionaire! I own ships upon the sea, laden with"
3988,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"merchandise, and mines in the earth rich with ore, and acres of land more"
3989,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,than I can count!”
3990,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3991,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Away! Answer me no more.”
3992,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3993,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,And the rich man turns away in wrath and confusion.
3994,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
3995,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Presently appears another, in workman’s garb, which proves to be only a"
3996,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"disguise, for, as he nears the entrance to the valley, on a sudden behold"
3997,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"him a warrior clad in armor! And this armor is like nothing that Rudolph,"
3998,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the Czar, has seen. The various pieces of which it is composed are of"
3999,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"different hues; the helmet white as snow, and so dazzling that he turns"
4000,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,his eyes from it as he would turn them from the burning sun of noonday;
4001,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the breastplate like gold, only brighter; the sword red like flame;"
4002,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the shield is as if it were of adamant, and the device upon it is an"
4003,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"anchor. As the warrior gives his pass to the sentinel, the Czar, unseen,"
4004,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,recognizes his own father!
4005,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4006,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,But the sentinel does not look at the pass. “I know thee by thine armor!”
4007,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"he cries, with a smile of welcome, and immediately blows a bugle which"
4008,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"he carries, and the sound rings through the valley—sweetly, sweetly!"
4009,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"winding among the hills, sending back a thousand echoes on its way. Then"
4010,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the people pour out of the hamlets, and come down in myriads to meet the"
4011,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"warrior, strewing the way with flowers and greeting him with music—oh,"
4012,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"so marvelous! oh, so thrilling! that the very light moves to and fro in"
4013,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"little waves, as if keeping time, and the flashing, gurgling waters join"
4014,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the chorus, and the overhanging branches swing a slow accompaniment."
4015,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4016,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Among the people who surround the warrior, just one glimpse has Rudolph,"
4017,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the Czar, of her who was once his mother, arrayed in garments the beauty"
4018,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"of which is only surpassed by the beauty of her face, and her face"
4019,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,surpasses in loveliness all that he ever imagined could be; just one
4020,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"glimpse, too, of another face he has known; then the people close about"
4021,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"them and they are lost sight of; and while he reaches out his hands,"
4022,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"crying, “Oh, my mother! Oh, my brother! Oh, my father!” the radiant"
4023,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"throng moves backward up the valley and into one of those other valleys,"
4024,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and disappears, and the music grows fainter and fainter. As he lies"
4025,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"weeping and listening to that faint, far melody, one from the valley,"
4026,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"mantled in white and mounted upon a snowy steed, rides into the dark"
4027,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"defile, and as he passes by where Rudolph, the Czar, lies, the latter"
4028,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,questions:
4029,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4030,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Where have they taken the warrior who entered just now?”
4031,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4032,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“They are leading him to the royal city, to receive from our King’s own"
4033,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,hands the unfading crown of laurels which is given to the victors.”
4034,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4035,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“But I was once well acquainted with this one, and I never knew that he"
4036,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"was a warrior, nor did I guess that he wore armor.”"
4037,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4038,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“There are many who wear armor unsuspected, and fight their battles"
4039,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,unseen.”
4040,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4041,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“But how did he procure his pass?”
4042,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4043,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“Hast thou not heard how our King sends forth spies into all lands to
4044,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"search for those who will make good, loyal subjects, ever willing to"
4045,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"obey and carry out his commands? To all such are given passes, signed"
4046,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"by the King himself, that when they come hither they may be allowed to"
4047,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"enter. All others are excluded, lest, entering, they annoy the peaceful"
4048,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"citizens, and stir up strife and discord.”"
4049,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4050,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“But this warrior’s armor was unlike anything I have ever seen. Of what
4051,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,metal is it composed?”
4052,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4053,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“It is made of several different metals; the helmet of a mixture of two
4054,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"metals, called Truth and Honesty; the breastplate is also of two metals,"
4055,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Patience and Constancy; the sword, of the Hatred of all that is base and"
4056,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"evil; and the shield, of the Hope of admission to our land; for this—to"
4057,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,gain entrance here—is considered the highest privilege that can be
4058,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"granted to any mortal. But I ride on an errand for the King, and must not"
4059,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,delay.”
4060,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4061,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“One moment more, O bright one! Is there no secret path by which I can"
4062,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,gain entrance to this peaceful kingdom? Is this the only way?”
4063,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4064,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“This is the only way.”
4065,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4066,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“O bright one, return, I pray thee, to the King, and entreat him in my"
4067,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"behalf that he will permit me to enter! for I am weary, oh! I am _so_"
4068,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"weary, and I can find no place where I may rest; and there, too, are all"
4069,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"who love or care for me, and all I love or care for.”"
4070,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4071,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"But the messenger answers sorrowfully, “Thou hast no pass!” and rides"
4072,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"away, and the snow-white mantle and the snow-white steed flit along"
4073,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"through the brooding shadows till, in the distance, they are lost from"
4074,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"view. And Rudolph, the Czar, straining his eyes to follow them, is"
4075,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"suddenly startled by a loud, mocking laugh that rings weirdly up and down"
4076,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"the dark defile; and, turning, he sees standing behind him the tall,"
4077,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,gaunt personage in black; and the sight of that muffled figure so fills
4078,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"him with terror, that he rises and hastens away as fast as his feeble"
4079,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,limbs can carry him.
4080,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4081,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And now there comes to him remembrance of a place where, when he was a"
4082,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"boy, he rested well and slept undisturbed; and onward he journeys by land"
4083,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"and sea, pausing not till he reaches his native town and has found the"
4084,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,humble cottage where he used to dwell. He creeps softly to the window and
4085,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"peers in. It is all there, just as it used to be—the cupboard in this"
4086,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,corner; the chintz-covered lounge in that; the simple brown paper on the
4087,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"wall; the window-curtains of muslin; the clock on the mantel; the clean,"
4088,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,white floor; the polished stove; the vapor curling from the spout of the
4089,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"shining tea-kettle—all there, so comfortable, so cosy, so homelike! But"
4090,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,the people are strangers. That is not little Karl playing on the floor;
4091,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"that is not the mother knitting in the rocking-chair. And Rudolph, the"
4092,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Czar, weeps again, remembering how the last words he had for them were"
4093,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"harsh words, and that he is never to see them more."
4094,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4095,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,At length he knocks at the door and explains to the master of the house—
4096,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4097,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“I am a feeble old man, in agony of weariness for lack of sleep; for I"
4098,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"have traveled far and searched long, but have found no place where I"
4099,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,might rest in peace. And I finally bethought me of a low room under a
4100,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"sloping roof, where, in my childhood, I rested well and undisturbed. The"
4101,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"roof above is that same sloping roof, and beneath it is that chamber. And"
4102,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"I will give to thee, good sir, all the gold in my purse—and there is much"
4103,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"gold in it—if I may lodge there for one night only, and sleep once more"
4104,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,as I slept when I was a lad.”
4105,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4106,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And the good man of the house bids him enter and welcome, but refuses the"
4107,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"proffered gold. And Rudolph, the Czar, climbs up the narrow stairs to the"
4108,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"low room under the sloping roof, and he lies down there, forgetting to"
4109,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"look for the lifted sword, and he closes his weary eyes, and a delicious"
4110,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"drowsiness steals over him, and there is no fear in his heart, and"
4111,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"nothing molests him, and at last he sleeps, sleeps, sleeps."
4112,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4113,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,*       *       *       *       *
4114,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4115,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,What sound is that? A ringing of bells. It wakens Rudolph. He gazes
4116,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,about the room. On a stand in the corner a lamp is dimly burning. Some
4117,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"one is sitting here beside the bed. “Oh, go away, good sir, and leave me"
4118,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,in peace!” he moans piteously. “Did I not offer thee all the gold in my
4119,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"purse? Why, then, dost thou trouble me? Do no murder, I beseech thee, for"
4120,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"I am old and feeble, and I have not slept before in a hundred years.”"
4121,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4122,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Thou art dreaming, Rudolph. There is nothing to fear.”"
4123,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4124,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Thou, my father!” and he seizes the two toil-hardened hands, covering"
4125,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,them with kisses and with tears. “How camest thou here? I feared I should
4126,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,never behold thy face again! And where are my mother and my brother?”
4127,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4128,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“The dear mother and our little Karl will see thee in the morning to wish
4129,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,thee a ‘Happy New Year.’”
4130,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4131,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"A Happy New Year! Rudolph puts his hand to his forehead, as if to smooth"
4132,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"out some knot there underneath. “Truly, I do not know,” he murmurs, “it"
4133,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"all seemed so real. Have I been dreaming, dear father?”"
4134,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4135,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,And then the father explains how he heard wailing and shrieking in the
4136,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"night, and came to learn the cause, but, fearing a fever, staid to watch"
4137,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,awhile.
4138,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4139,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“It is hard, dear father, that after thou hast been working all the day"
4140,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,thou must needs watch all the night.”
4141,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4142,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“I would do much more than that for Rudolph, although he is ‘only the son"
4143,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,of a carpenter.’”
4144,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4145,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"“Alas, that I talked in my sleep!”"
4146,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4147,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"Hark, the bells! once more they clang together—all the bells in the town."
4148,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"So it is, so it is the New Year! They are ringing in the New Year. And"
4149,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,these New-Year days—standing like mile-stones all along the highway of
4150,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,Time—who gave them to the world for holidays? Was it not “the carpenter’s
4151,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"son”? Rudolph, trying to smooth out the kink in his brain, finds that"
4152,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"thought entangled with it, somehow. After awhile he exclaims, with face"
4153,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,aglow:
4154,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4155,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,“It is good that this is the first day of the year! That is the grand
4156,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"time to turn over a new leaf—no, to put on a new suit of armor! For I"
4157,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"have learned something from my dream, father; it is this—thou art a Hero."
4158,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And I mean to be another, just like thee!”"
4159,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4160,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,"And the father looks down into Rudolph’s eyes, and sees that the demon"
4161,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,has departed.
4162,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4163,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4164,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4165,CZAR AND CARPENTER.,
4166,QUEEN MABEL.,QUEEN MABEL.
4167,QUEEN MABEL.,
4168,QUEEN MABEL.,
4169,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Green, green are the meadows,"
4170,QUEEN MABEL.,"And blue, blue is the sky,"
4171,QUEEN MABEL.,"And glad, glad is the morning,"
4172,QUEEN MABEL.,And happy and gay am I.
4173,QUEEN MABEL.,"Tirra-la-la, la, la, la!"
4174,QUEEN MABEL.,And happy and gay am I.
4175,QUEEN MABEL.,
4176,QUEEN MABEL.,"“White, white are the daisies"
4177,QUEEN MABEL.,"Blossoming everywhere,"
4178,QUEEN MABEL.,"And red, red are the roses,"
4179,QUEEN MABEL.,"And sweet, sweet is the air!"
4180,QUEEN MABEL.,
4181,QUEEN MABEL.,"“And sweet is the burnie’s music,"
4182,QUEEN MABEL.,And the music of bee and bird—
4183,QUEEN MABEL.,"Ha, ha! the sweetest music"
4184,QUEEN MABEL.,That ever and ever you heard!
4185,QUEEN MABEL.,
4186,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Gold, golden the sunbeams,"
4187,QUEEN MABEL.,"And bright, bright is the day,"
4188,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the bees, and the birds, and Mabel,"
4189,QUEEN MABEL.,Little of care have they!
4190,QUEEN MABEL.,
4191,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Oh! and over the meadows,"
4192,QUEEN MABEL.,"Oh! and under the sky,"
4193,QUEEN MABEL.,"And all in the dewy morning,"
4194,QUEEN MABEL.,Happy and gay am I!
4195,QUEEN MABEL.,"Tirra-la-la, la, la, la!"
4196,QUEEN MABEL.,Happy and gay am I!”
4197,QUEEN MABEL.,
4198,QUEEN MABEL.,"The queen passed by in her carriage,"
4199,QUEEN MABEL.,"And little Mabel’s song,"
4200,QUEEN MABEL.,"By a roving zephyr wafted,"
4201,QUEEN MABEL.,She heard as she rode along.
4202,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Ah, child!” she sighed as she listened,"
4203,QUEEN MABEL.,A shadow upon her brow—
4204,QUEEN MABEL.,"“With the birds, and the bees, and the blossoms"
4205,QUEEN MABEL.,How happy and gay art thou!”
4206,QUEEN MABEL.,
4207,QUEEN MABEL.,"Standing knee-deep in clover,"
4208,QUEEN MABEL.,Mabel looked up and saw
4209,QUEEN MABEL.,"The glitter and royal splendor,"
4210,QUEEN MABEL.,And her voice was hushed with awe;
4211,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the light from her sweet eyes faded,"
4212,QUEEN MABEL.,And the song died out of her heart;
4213,QUEEN MABEL.,"“O queen!” she sighed in her envy,"
4214,QUEEN MABEL.,“How happy and grand thou art!”
4215,QUEEN MABEL.,
4216,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the glee was gone from the morning,"
4217,QUEEN MABEL.,"The gladness gone from the day,"
4218,QUEEN MABEL.,As through the tangle of clover
4219,QUEEN MABEL.,She wearily took her way.
4220,QUEEN MABEL.,“What a wretched place to live in!”
4221,QUEEN MABEL.,She paused at a cottage door.
4222,QUEEN MABEL.,“How lowly and plain and humble!
4223,QUEEN MABEL.,I never noticed before!”
4224,QUEEN MABEL.,"And over her work she muttered,"
4225,QUEEN MABEL.,“Little the queen of the land
4226,QUEEN MABEL.,
4227,QUEEN MABEL.,With the soot and grime of the kitchen
4228,QUEEN MABEL.,Needs ever to soil her hand!”
4229,QUEEN MABEL.,"And over her simple sewing,"
4230,QUEEN MABEL.,"As the afternoon went by,"
4231,QUEEN MABEL.,"Often she fell to musing,"
4232,QUEEN MABEL.,Often she breathed a sigh;
4233,QUEEN MABEL.,And often she thus would murmur—
4234,QUEEN MABEL.,“I doubt if ever the queen
4235,QUEEN MABEL.,"Would deign, with her jeweled fingers,"
4236,QUEEN MABEL.,To sew an inch of a seam.”
4237,QUEEN MABEL.,And wearily on her pillow
4238,QUEEN MABEL.,At even she laid her head;
4239,QUEEN MABEL.,"“I never shall be a queen,” she sobbed,"
4240,QUEEN MABEL.,“And I wish that I were dead!”
4241,QUEEN MABEL.,
4242,QUEEN MABEL.,"But presently came a message,"
4243,QUEEN MABEL.,"Reading—oh, was it true?—"
4244,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Arise and come to me, Mabel;"
4245,QUEEN MABEL.,"I, the queen, have sent for you.”"
4246,QUEEN MABEL.,Then quick to the royal palace
4247,QUEEN MABEL.,"She rode in the carriage grand,"
4248,QUEEN MABEL.,And they led her through halls of marble
4249,QUEEN MABEL.,To the queen of all the land;
4250,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the queen arose, and laying"
4251,QUEEN MABEL.,"Her crown at Mabel’s feet,"
4252,QUEEN MABEL.,"“I go to be free and happy,"
4253,QUEEN MABEL.,"And play in the meadows sweet,”"
4254,QUEEN MABEL.,"She said, and to all her people—"
4255,QUEEN MABEL.,“Farewell!” and “farewell!” she said;
4256,QUEEN MABEL.,And the people took up the golden crown
4257,QUEEN MABEL.,And put it on Mabel’s head.
4258,QUEEN MABEL.,"And oh! it was heavy, heavy!"
4259,QUEEN MABEL.,"Heavy, heavy as lead!"
4260,QUEEN MABEL.,
4261,QUEEN MABEL.,"To a gilded throne they brought her,"
4262,QUEEN MABEL.,In purple and ermine clad.
4263,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Hail to thee, fair queen Mabel!”"
4264,QUEEN MABEL.,They shouted with voices glad;
4265,QUEEN MABEL.,"And “Hail to thee, fair queen Mabel!”"
4266,QUEEN MABEL.,"Rang in her ears all day,"
4267,QUEEN MABEL.,"Till, weary, herself she questioned,"
4268,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Is it right, is it right to stay?"
4269,QUEEN MABEL.,To drive the cows from the pasture
4270,QUEEN MABEL.,Is Mabel’s task alone;
4271,QUEEN MABEL.,"And my father at work since morning,"
4272,QUEEN MABEL.,He will soon be coming home.
4273,QUEEN MABEL.,
4274,QUEEN MABEL.,"“He will miss his little Mabel,"
4275,QUEEN MABEL.,For there is no one but me
4276,QUEEN MABEL.,To toast the bread for his supper
4277,QUEEN MABEL.,And make him a cup of tea.
4278,QUEEN MABEL.,But no! am I not a lady?
4279,QUEEN MABEL.,It is no care of mine
4280,QUEEN MABEL.,To worry about the supper
4281,QUEEN MABEL.,And the milking of the kine!”
4282,QUEEN MABEL.,
4283,QUEEN MABEL.,"So she dwelt in the marble palace,"
4284,QUEEN MABEL.,"And dined from a golden plate,"
4285,QUEEN MABEL.,"And slept in a silken chamber,"
4286,QUEEN MABEL.,And sat in the chair of state.
4287,QUEEN MABEL.,And whenever she went riding
4288,QUEEN MABEL.,"The people with cheers would greet,"
4289,QUEEN MABEL.,And maidens and little children
4290,QUEEN MABEL.,With blossoms would strew the street.
4291,QUEEN MABEL.,
4292,QUEEN MABEL.,"And royally thus lived Mabel,"
4293,QUEEN MABEL.,Her only task—to command;
4294,QUEEN MABEL.,"Servants, unnumbered, ready"
4295,QUEEN MABEL.,To move at the wave of her hand;
4296,QUEEN MABEL.,And alway about her lingered
4297,QUEEN MABEL.,"Gay courtiers, a dazzling throng;"
4298,QUEEN MABEL.,And the blithe hours swiftly flitted
4299,QUEEN MABEL.,"With story, and dance, and song."
4300,QUEEN MABEL.,"But often herself she questioned,"
4301,QUEEN MABEL.,"As she sat on the gilded throne,"
4302,QUEEN MABEL.,"“How is it with them, I wonder—"
4303,QUEEN MABEL.,How is it with them at home?”
4304,QUEEN MABEL.,
4305,QUEEN MABEL.,As the palace with mirth and music
4306,QUEEN MABEL.,"Echoed and rang, one night,"
4307,QUEEN MABEL.,"The people peered through the windows,"
4308,QUEEN MABEL.,Watching the festive sight:
4309,QUEEN MABEL.,"And a beggar in rags and tatters,"
4310,QUEEN MABEL.,"Listening, shook his fist;"
4311,QUEEN MABEL.,“What right have they to be merry
4312,QUEEN MABEL.,When my little ones starve?” he hissed.
4313,QUEEN MABEL.,And the people his words repeated:
4314,QUEEN MABEL.,"“What right, to be sure?” they said,"
4315,QUEEN MABEL.,“Flaunting in silks and diamonds
4316,QUEEN MABEL.,While our little ones cry for bread.”
4317,QUEEN MABEL.,
4318,QUEEN MABEL.,"And ever, as thus they murmured,"
4319,QUEEN MABEL.,"Louder their voices grew,"
4320,QUEEN MABEL.,"Till, all in a red-hot anger,"
4321,QUEEN MABEL.,To the palace doors they flew.
4322,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the sentinels, at each entrance,"
4323,QUEEN MABEL.,"Quickly they put to flight,"
4324,QUEEN MABEL.,And hurried with cries and clamor
4325,QUEEN MABEL.,Into the halls so bright—
4326,QUEEN MABEL.,"Into the halls of marble,"
4327,QUEEN MABEL.,"With clubs and with axes armed,"
4328,QUEEN MABEL.,Till the sound of their shouts and curses
4329,QUEEN MABEL.,"The courtiers hearing, alarmed,"
4330,QUEEN MABEL.,"Fled in their silks and diamonds,"
4331,QUEEN MABEL.,Leaving the queen alone.
4332,QUEEN MABEL.,"On rushed the riotous rabble,"
4333,QUEEN MABEL.,"Making its way to the throne,"
4334,QUEEN MABEL.,And they who had “Hail Queen Mabel!”
4335,QUEEN MABEL.,"Shouted with loyal will,"
4336,QUEEN MABEL.,Now aloft their cruel weapons
4337,QUEEN MABEL.,"Brandished, intent to kill."
4338,QUEEN MABEL.,
4339,QUEEN MABEL.,"Then she shrieked for help in her terror,"
4340,QUEEN MABEL.,Never a friend came nigh.
4341,QUEEN MABEL.,"So, as the crowd drew nearer,"
4342,QUEEN MABEL.,Sudden she turned to fly;
4343,QUEEN MABEL.,And casting aside the purple robe
4344,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the heavy golden crown,"
4345,QUEEN MABEL.,"Away and away she hastened,"
4346,QUEEN MABEL.,To the meadows she wandered down;
4347,QUEEN MABEL.,"Down to the meadows wandered,"
4348,QUEEN MABEL.,"Hastened away and away,"
4349,QUEEN MABEL.,Till the birds and the dewy blossoms
4350,QUEEN MABEL.,Were roused by the dawning day.
4351,QUEEN MABEL.,
4352,QUEEN MABEL.,"But the world it was sad and silent,"
4353,QUEEN MABEL.,"Clouded and gray the morn,"
4354,QUEEN MABEL.,"As wearily on she wandered,"
4355,QUEEN MABEL.,Wearily and forlorn.
4356,QUEEN MABEL.,"The burnie it went complaining,"
4357,QUEEN MABEL.,"Fretting its way along,"
4358,QUEEN MABEL.,"Making no pleasant music,"
4359,QUEEN MABEL.,Singing no pleasant song;
4360,QUEEN MABEL.,And ever as in the hedges
4361,QUEEN MABEL.,"She came to a sweet wild rose,"
4362,QUEEN MABEL.,At the touch of her queenly fingers
4363,QUEEN MABEL.,The petals would sadly close.
4364,QUEEN MABEL.,"Once did she call, “Sing, birdies!”"
4365,QUEEN MABEL.,But the little birds were dumb:
4366,QUEEN MABEL.,“Come to me as you used to!”
4367,QUEEN MABEL.,"But they, fearing, would not come."
4368,QUEEN MABEL.,
4369,QUEEN MABEL.,“What a cosy place to live in!”
4370,QUEEN MABEL.,She paused at a cottage door.
4371,QUEEN MABEL.,“Not a palace half so lovely
4372,QUEEN MABEL.,Is there the country o’er!”
4373,QUEEN MABEL.,Within sat a woman knitting—
4374,QUEEN MABEL.,A woman aged and blind;
4375,QUEEN MABEL.,"And ever she dropped the stitches,"
4376,QUEEN MABEL.,Trying in vain to find.
4377,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Grandmother, let me help thee,”"
4378,QUEEN MABEL.,Mabel held out her hand.
4379,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Nay,” said the gray-haired woman,"
4380,QUEEN MABEL.,“Thou art the queen of the land!”
4381,QUEEN MABEL.,
4382,QUEEN MABEL.,Just at that moment entered
4383,QUEEN MABEL.,A workingman—quick she cried
4384,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Father, oh, dost thou know me?”"
4385,QUEEN MABEL.,"Sorrowfully he sighed,"
4386,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Oh, queen and gracious lady,"
4387,QUEEN MABEL.,Tell me if thou dost know
4388,QUEEN MABEL.,"Aught of our little Mabel,"
4389,QUEEN MABEL.,Who was lost long years ago?
4390,QUEEN MABEL.,On a sunny summer morning
4391,QUEEN MABEL.,She strayed from the meadows green.
4392,QUEEN MABEL.,Tell me if thou hast seen her—
4393,QUEEN MABEL.,"Tell me, oh, gracious queen!”"
4394,QUEEN MABEL.,
4395,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Alas, they, too, have forgotten!”"
4396,QUEEN MABEL.,"Bowing her head, she wept—"
4397,QUEEN MABEL.,"And the weeping queen awakened,"
4398,QUEEN MABEL.,And found she had only slept.
4399,QUEEN MABEL.,"Safe in her low-ceiled chamber,"
4400,QUEEN MABEL.,"Flooded with rosy light,"
4401,QUEEN MABEL.,"Only the little Mabel,"
4402,QUEEN MABEL.,The Mabel of yesternight!
4403,QUEEN MABEL.,Then aloud rejoicing sang she
4404,QUEEN MABEL.,The song of the day gone by
4405,QUEEN MABEL.,"“Glad, glad is the morning,"
4406,QUEEN MABEL.,And happy and gay am I!”
4407,QUEEN MABEL.,

4416,I.,I.
4417,I.,
4418,I.,"The King came home from battle,"
4419,I.,He came in triumph proud;
4420,I.,"Before, the heralds flying,"
4421,I.,"With trumpets pealing loud,"
4422,I.,"Ten thousand warriors followed,"
4423,I.,"With gleaming spear and shield,"
4424,I.,A goodly store of trophies
4425,I.,"Brought from the bloody field,"
4426,I.,A forest bright of banners
4427,I.,"Unfurled like tongues of flame,"
4428,I.,And clanking ranks of captives
4429,I.,To swell the mighty train.
4430,I.,
4431,I.,Beneath the arching gateway
4432,I.,"And up the stony street,"
4433,I.,"To time of martial music,"
4434,I.,Passed on the trampling feet;
4435,I.,But ever chief and foremost
4436,I.,The King in triumph rode;
4437,I.,"His armor flashed in sunlight,"
4438,I.,"Gay-plumed his helmet glowed,"
4439,I.,"High stepped his coal-black charger,"
4440,I.,"Impatient of the rein,"
4441,I.,And curved the sleek neck proudly
4442,I.,And shook the rippling mane.
4443,I.,
4444,I.,More proud than he the rider—
4445,I.,In look and mien more proud;
4446,I.,"Before, the heralds speeding"
4447,I.,And trumpeting aloud
4448,I.,"How Eric, the invader—"
4449,I.,Long time a dreaded foe—
4450,I.,Lay with the gory corses
4451,I.,Upon the plain below;
4452,I.,And how of his great army
4453,I.,A paltry little band
4454,I.,In hopeless rout
4455,I.,Had turned about
4456,I.,And fled to their own land.
4457,I.,
4458,I.,"Quick, at the cry of herald"
4459,I.,"And clattering of hoof,"
4460,I.,"From door and wall and window,"
4461,I.,"From balcony and roof,"
4462,I.,Black hung the crowd; with praises
4463,I.,Did all the city ring—
4464,I.,"With praises for the warriors,"
4465,I.,With praises for the King:—
4466,I.,"So loud, the infant Gerda"
4467,I.,"Was wakened from her sleep,"
4468,I.,"And, writhing in her cradle,"
4469,I.,"Forsooth began to weep,"
4470,I.,The while they praised her father
4471,I.,"Till all the air did ring,"
4472,I.,"The while the people shouted,"
4473,I.,“Forever live the King!”
4474,I.,
4475,I.,[Illustration:

4479,I.,
4480,I.,
4481,II.,II.
4482,II.,
4483,II.,All day it rained. The white doves
4484,II.,"Came not at Gerda’s call,"
4485,II.,To flock about the casement
4486,II.,"High up the palace wall,"
4487,II.,"To coo ’neath her caresses,"
4488,II.,"And plume their wings of snow,"
4489,II.,And pick the crumbs she scattered
4490,II.,Upon the ledge below.
4491,II.,
4492,II.,It rained all day. The sunbeams
4493,II.,Were weak and wan and rare—
4494,II.,The beams that seven summers
4495,II.,Had played with Gerda’s hair.
4496,II.,All day it rained unceasing.
4497,II.,"The quaint old lofty room,"
4498,II.,"For lack of bird and sunbeam,"
4499,II.,Was drear and full of gloom;
4500,II.,"And left among the shadows,"
4501,II.,"The while the raindrops beat,"
4502,II.,"With restless little fingers,"
4503,II.,"With restless little feet,"
4504,II.,Went Princess Gerda roaming
4505,II.,"The quaint old room around,"
4506,II.,"And thus behind the tapestry,"
4507,II.,"It chanced, a picture found—"
4508,II.,A painting blurred and faded:
4509,II.,"Two men had fought, and one"
4510,II.,"Lay vanquished, while the other,"
4511,II.,"With foot his neck upon,"
4512,II.,A murd’rous weapon brandished
4513,II.,Above the prostrate head.
4514,II.,"“Thou hateful, hateful fellow!”"
4515,II.,"In anger Gerda said,"
4516,II.,And clenched her small fist straightway
4517,II.,And smote the lifted hand.
4518,II.,"Lo! backward swung the picture,"
4519,II.,As tho’ a fairy’s wand
4520,II.,"Obeying; and before her,"
4521,II.,"There in the masonry,"
4522,II.,Black space and then a stairway—
4523,II.,So much did Gerda see.
4524,II.,"“Where does it go?” she wondered,"
4525,II.,"And, no one being nigh,"
4526,II.,"Into the darkness ventured,"
4527,II.,Nor waited for reply.
4528,II.,
4529,II.,"Down, down, and ever downward,"
4530,II.,The granite steps led on;
4531,II.,"With now and then a winding,"
4532,II.,With ever and anon
4533,II.,"A pause, a narrow landing,"
4534,II.,But never ray of light.
4535,II.,"On, on, went little Gerda,"
4536,II.,"And downward thro’ the night,"
4537,II.,Recalling wondrous stories
4538,II.,The good nurse Hedvig told
4539,II.,"Of a strange realm and dreamlike,"
4540,II.,"All paved and ceiled with gold,"
4541,II.,Where ruled the merry elf-king—
4542,II.,"A realm far underground,"
4543,II.,That a few favored mortals
4544,II.,By patient search had found.
4545,II.,
4546,II.,"So, on and on went Gerda,"
4547,II.,And downward through the night.
4548,II.,At length in maze of passages
4549,II.,"That led to left and right,"
4550,II.,The stony staircase ended;
4551,II.,"And, searching in the dark,"
4552,II.,"She wandered hither, thither:"
4553,II.,"The elf-land, where? But hark!"
4554,II.,What sound was that? She listened.
4555,II.,A moaning somewhere near!
4556,II.,"Again, again, a moaning!"
4557,II.,She fled away in fear.
4558,II.,From right to left she hurried;
4559,II.,She hurried to and fro;
4560,II.,"She called: “O good nurse Hedvig,"
4561,II.,Come to me here below!”
4562,II.,
4563,II.,Came never word of answer.
4564,II.,She could not find the way.
4565,II.,"In terror trembling, sobbing,"
4566,II.,Still onward did she stray.
4567,II.,“Who weeps?” Again she listened.
4568,II.,The voice was low and kind.
4569,II.,“’Tis I—’tis Princess Gerda;
4570,II.,The way I cannot find.”
4571,II.,
4572,II.,"“Fear not, O Princess Gerda!"
4573,II.,"If thou wilt turn the key,"
4574,II.,How gladly will I offer
4575,II.,To be a guide for thee.”
4576,II.,
4577,II.,Her little fingers feeling
4578,II.,"The slimy stones along,"
4579,II.,Found out the door of iron—
4580,II.,The iron door so strong:
4581,II.,"And standing there on tip-toe,"
4582,II.,"With all her might and main,"
4583,II.,"She, reaching, tried the rusty key,"
4584,II.,But tried and tried in vain.
4585,II.,
4586,II.,"“Once more, once more, O Princess!”"
4587,II.,At that she tried once more;
4588,II.,"The hinges grated harshly,"
4589,II.,And open flew the door;
4590,II.,And one came forth whose features
4591,II.,And form she could not see
4592,II.,For the deep darkness round her;
4593,II.,"But never aught cared she,"
4594,II.,Because the voice was pleasant
4595,II.,And drove away all fear—
4596,II.,"The voice that softly questioned,"
4597,II.,“How happened Gerda here?”
4598,II.,"“Down, down the longest stairway"
4599,II.,"That ever yet was found,"
4600,II.,I came to hunt for fairies
4601,II.,That dwell beneath the ground.”
4602,II.,
4603,II.,"“Now tell me, sweetest Gerda,"
4604,II.,"If I will show the way,"
4605,II.,And lead thee from the darkness
4606,II.,"Far up into the day,"
4607,II.,"Wilt never of thy venture,"
4608,II.,"Nor ever of thy guide,"
4609,II.,To any speak? Wilt promise?”
4610,II.,"She eagerly replied,"
4611,II.,"“Oh, yes, yes, yes! I promise!”"
4612,II.,"And, hand in hand, the two"
4613,II.,The dank and dismal corridors
4614,II.,Went searching through and through.
4615,II.,
4616,II.,"A narrow length of passage,"
4617,II.,"Low-ceiled, at last they gained,"
4618,II.,And midway in this passage
4619,II.,A narrow doorway framed;
4620,II.,And winding from this doorway
4621,II.,"Stone steps, a narrow flight,"
4622,II.,They found and followed—followed
4623,II.,Far up out of the night.
4624,II.,
4625,II.,"But when the little Gerda,"
4626,II.,"Safe in the dim old room,"
4627,II.,That now seemed full of sunlight
4628,II.,After the greater gloom—
4629,II.,When quick she turned to see him
4630,II.,"Who led—the pictured wall,"
4631,II.,The overhanging tapestry
4632,II.,She saw—and that was all.
4633,II.,
4634,II.,"And many days she marveled,"
4635,II.,And many nights did dream
4636,II.,"Of that good guide and gentle,"
4637,II.,Who came and went unseen.
4638,II.,"But never more the stairway,"
4639,II.,"So long and dark, she tried."
4640,II.,"She told not of her venture,"
4641,II.,She told not of her guide.
4642,II.,
4643,II.,"The dungeon-keeper, bringing"
4644,II.,"The daily drink and bread,"
4645,II.,The iron doors found open!
4646,II.,The prisoners had fled!
4647,II.,"In doubt and wonder gazing,"
4648,II.,He paled with sudden fear:
4649,II.,“Alack! the King will hear it!
4650,II.,Alack! the King will hear!”
4651,II.,
4652,II.,Down fell the bread and water—
4653,II.,With flaming torch he sought
4654,II.,A narrow length of passage
4655,II.,Deep through the rough rock wrought;
4656,II.,"And there for miles he wandered,"
4657,II.,"Lit by the torch’s ray,"
4658,II.,Nor guessed how lately other feet
4659,II.,Had traveled the same way.
4660,II.,At last he reached a country
4661,II.,Beside the western sea—
4662,II.,A fair and goodly country.
4663,II.,There now in peace dwelt he.
4664,II.,
4665,II.,
4666,III.,III.
4667,III.,
4668,III.,"The years have passed, and Gerda,"
4669,III.,"Now grown a maiden tall,"
4670,III.,Looks from the latticed casement
4671,III.,High up the palace wall;
4672,III.,But not for flash and flutter
4673,III.,Of snowy wings looks she—
4674,III.,Thro’ rain or sun
4675,III.,No longer come
4676,III.,The white doves merrily;
4677,III.,"For peace and they have flown afar,"
4678,III.,And all the land is red with war.
4679,III.,
4680,III.,"Great Ivar, dreaded Ivar,"
4681,III.,"Who rules the northern coast,"
4682,III.,Across his rocky borders
4683,III.,Has led a conquering host;
4684,III.,And smiling field and hamlet
4685,III.,"Despoiling as they came,"
4686,III.,Five months before the city walls
4687,III.,The savage hordes have lain.
4688,III.,The glimmer of their camp-fires
4689,III.,"The Princess Gerda sees,"
4690,III.,"Their tents, their hostile ensigns"
4691,III.,A-floating in the breeze.
4692,III.,She looks forth from her window
4693,III.,With eyes grown used to tears;
4694,III.,And as she looks she listens—
4695,III.,What sound is that she hears?
4696,III.,
4697,III.,"A crash, a shriek, a shouting—"
4698,III.,A battlement gives way;
4699,III.,Swift thro’ the breach come rushing
4700,III.,"The foe in dire array,"
4701,III.,And sudden as a thunder-storm
4702,III.,"Sweeps o’er the smiling day,"
4703,III.,The air is dark and clamorous
4704,III.,And wild with deadly fray.
4705,III.,
4706,III.,But calm and clear
4707,III.,Does Gerda hear
4708,III.,"His orders ring,"
4709,III.,"As the brave King,"
4710,III.,"Unfaltering,"
4711,III.,Keeps the fierce foe at bay.
4712,III.,
4713,III.,But see! he falls!
4714,III.,“The King is down!”
4715,III.,Who’ll guard the walls?
4716,III.,Who’ll save the town?
4717,III.,“The King is slain! we fight in vain!
4718,III.,"Alack, alack, the King is slain!”"
4719,III.,
4720,III.,"The panic-stricken soldiers,"
4721,III.,"Pale-faced, from street to street"
4722,III.,"Flee wildly, as the enemy"
4723,III.,Pursue their flying feet:
4724,III.,"“The King is slain, the town is lost!"
4725,III.,Who can withstand great Ivar’s host!”
4726,III.,
4727,III.,But look! what stranger legions
4728,III.,Against the hostile tide
4729,III.,Leap forth in shining armor
4730,III.,"And bold advancing ride,"
4731,III.,"Ride on and ever onward,"
4732,III.,Beat back the hostile tide?
4733,III.,
4734,III.,“The gods! the gods! Valhalla
4735,III.,Has sent its warriors down
4736,III.,To fight against our Ivar!
4737,III.,To battle for the town!”
4738,III.,And in dismay and terror
4739,III.,Is hushed the conquering cry.
4740,III.,"From street to street,"
4741,III.,"In swift retreat,"
4742,III.,"And over fallen battlement,"
4743,III.,The pale besiegers fly—
4744,III.,Fly fast and far; nor pause they
4745,III.,"Till, on the northern shore,"
4746,III.,"They see the birchen forests,"
4747,III.,And hear the breakers roar.
4748,III.,
4749,III.,"Meanwhile, with peals of gladness"
4750,III.,"The rescued city rang,"
4751,III.,And loud their great deliverance
4752,III.,"The joyous people sang,"
4753,III.,And loud they sang the praises
4754,III.,"Of him, the unknown knight,"
4755,III.,Who led his valiant legions
4756,III.,To battle for the right.
4757,III.,
4758,III.,"So loud and long their praises,"
4759,III.,"Awaking from his swoon,"
4760,III.,"The King o’erheard, and seeing"
4761,III.,"Who wore the chieftain’s plume,"
4762,III.,"Aghast, stood up and questioned,"
4763,III.,"Hand on his horse’s rein,"
4764,III.,“What art thou—man or spirit?
4765,III.,And what may be thy name?”
4766,III.,
4767,III.,"“I am, O King, no spirit;"
4768,III.,And Eric is my name;—
4769,III.,"Prince Eric, son of Eric,"
4770,III.,Who sleeps on yonder plain.”
4771,III.,
4772,III.,“What! Eric? son of Eric?
4773,III.,"Ah, I have heard of thee,"
4774,III.,How wise and well thou rulest
4775,III.,Beside the western sea.
4776,III.,But why dost thou come hither
4777,III.,"To drive away the foe,"
4778,III.,"And earn my people’s praises,"
4779,III.,Since well thou seem’st to know
4780,III.,"That it was I,"
4781,III.,"In years gone by,"
4782,III.,Who laid thy father low?”
4783,III.,
4784,III.,“Not for thy people’s praises
4785,III.,"I hither led my band,"
4786,III.,"But with, O king, thy favor,"
4787,III.,To win thy daughter’s hand.”
4788,III.,
4789,III.,“Great soul and gallant suitor!
4790,III.,"Well doth he play his part,"
4791,III.,"Who, seeking hand of daughter,"
4792,III.,Doth steal the father’s heart.”
4793,III.,
4794,III.,But Princess Gerda saw not:
4795,III.,"She heeded naught of all,"
4796,III.,Nor gazed she from the window
4797,III.,High up the palace wall.
4798,III.,"“Wherefore the loud rejoicing,"
4799,III.,"Wherefore the triumph vain,"
4800,III.,"Since he is dead—my father,—"
4801,III.,"Since he, the King, is slain?”"
4802,III.,
4803,III.,With streaming eyes she greeted
4804,III.,"Two ent’ring at the door,"
4805,III.,"Aye, even him who bowed so low"
4806,III.,His white plumes swept the floor;
4807,III.,The other—lo! her father!
4808,III.,Behold his spirit come!
4809,III.,She stood in trembling wonder;
4810,III.,Her pallid lips were dumb.
4811,III.,
4812,III.,"“Fear not, O Princess Gerda!"
4813,III.,"If thou wilt turn the key,"
4814,III.,How gladly will I offer
4815,III.,To be a guide for thee!”
4816,III.,
4817,III.,So spake the Prince; and Gerda
4818,III.,In listening paler grew;
4819,III.,"Recalling guide and venture,"
4820,III.,"The words, the voice she knew."
4821,III.,“They come to me from spirit-land!
4822,III.,"Two heroes are they, tall and grand,"
4823,III.,And clad in armor bright!”
4824,III.,"And in her fear,"
4825,III.,"As they drew near,"
4826,III.,"The quaint old room reeled round her,"
4827,III.,And all was black as night.
4828,III.,
4829,III.,But when again the Princess
4830,III.,"Her blue eyes opened wide,"
4831,III.,And saw the good King kneeling
4832,III.,"And smiling at her side,"
4833,III.,"And heard him softly whisper,"
4834,III.,"“Behold, my little one,"
4835,III.,I bring to thee a suitor
4836,III.,Will please me for a son”—
4837,III.,"She bowed in sweet submission,"
4838,III.,And meekly answered she:
4839,III.,"“Whatever please my father,"
4840,III.,That also pleaseth me.”
4841,III.,
4842,III.,"And in the royal city,"
4843,III.,"And all the country thro’,"
4844,III.,Were festal cheer and gladness
4845,III.,Where late were war and woe;
4846,III.,For the good King’s dominions
4847,III.,"And those the sea beside,"
4848,III.,Were wed when Princess Gerda
4849,III.,Became brave Eric’s bride.

4927,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Oh, there were wondrous sights!"
4928,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Here the ceilings were golden-beamed,"

4930,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",With marbles and malachites;
4931,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Diamonds were set in the roof for stars,"
4932,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The rafters were made of silver bars,"

4934,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Oh, in that cavern, high and wide,"

4936,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","To travel alone and without a guide,"
4937,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He had lost his way
4938,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And gone astray
4939,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And wandered many a year;
4940,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And if he had met the giant,"
4941,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He surely had died of fear.
4942,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
4943,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",But there was a fairy who knew the way:
4944,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Often by night and often by day
4945,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","To a dense forest she would go,"
4946,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And there, in a cave all dark and low,"
4947,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","A rock as heavy as iron,"
4948,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And as bright and as black as coal,"
4949,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Swift, when her wand she lifted,"
4950,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Away and away would roll;
4951,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And down would she clamber, clamber,"
4952,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Through hundreds of miles of gloom,"
4953,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",On the rounds of a golden ladder
4954,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That led to a wonderful room—
4955,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Oh, a wonderful, wonderful chamber,"
4956,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Flooded with amber light;
4957,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","For there, at the centre of the earth,"
4958,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",A mighty fire on a mighty hearth
4959,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Burned ruddy, and warm, and bright;"
4960,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Burned ruddy and bright forever,"
4961,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With billows of orange flame,"
4962,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the giant’s occupation
4963,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Was—never to let it wane.
4964,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And there would the fairy find him
4965,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Stirring the coals red hot:
4966,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Good-morrow to you, Jungenthor!”"
4967,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",So would the fairy say;
4968,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“And what and what does Winnikin want,"
4969,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And what does she want to-day?”
4970,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",So would the giant grumble;
4971,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",But Winnikin feared him not.
4972,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
4973,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And, now, “O Giant Jungenthor!”"
4974,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Did her tale of wrong begin,"
4975,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“There are two wicked cities—
4976,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","A trouble to Winnikin,"
4977,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The rich they are proud and cruel,"
4978,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The poor they will lie and steal,"
4979,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And trouble is always brewing
4980,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That Winnikin cannot heal;
4981,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the friendly care and watching
4982,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Of the fairies they are not worth;
4983,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O Jungenthor, those cities"
4984,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Are blots on the face of the earth!”
4985,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
4986,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","As soon as he guessed her errand,"
4987,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The giant poked the fire
4988,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Till it roared, and hissed, and crackled,"
4989,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Till the flames curled high and higher,"
4990,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And billows of smoke and cinders
4991,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","From the chimney-top rolled out,"
4992,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And darkened the sky at noonday,"
4993,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And shadowed the land about.
4994,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then he filled ten billion barrels
4995,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With the soot that trickled down,"
4996,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And up through the chimney hurled them,"
4997,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Up through the chimney brown;
4998,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And lo! when the morning’s sunlight
4999,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Shone through the clouds of smoke,"
5000,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",In those two wicked cities
5001,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Neither prince nor beggar woke;
5002,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For the soot from the giant’s chimney
5003,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Had deluged the country wide;
5004,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And over those wicked cities
5005,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",It rolled in a turbid tide.
5006,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",All in the night
5007,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",They were buried from sight.
5008,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Ha, ha!” laughed Giant Jungenthor,"
5009,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Is Winnikin satisfied?”
5010,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5011,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And this was the fairy’s errand
5012,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",When she came another time:
5013,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“O Jungenthor, a monarch"
5014,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Has builded a palace fine;
5015,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Aided by dwarf and elfin
5016,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He has builded it tall and grand.
5017,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With marble white from the quarry,"
5018,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Not hewn by mortal hand;
5019,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For night by night
5020,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",In the pale moonlight
5021,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Did we hammer and delve away,"
5022,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To get the great stones ready
5023,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For the workmen of the day.
5024,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O Jungenthor, we labored,"
5025,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Behold, for a thankless King!"
5026,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For he has cut down the forest
5027,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Where oft, in a merry ring,"
5028,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Did the fairies dance and frolic,"
5029,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Or among the branches swing.
5030,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",After all our toil and trouble
5031,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","He has destroyed our trees,"
5032,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the sight of his gorgeous palace
5033,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Winnikin does not please.”
5034,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5035,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",As soon as her story ended
5036,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Did the angry giant frown;
5037,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","He lifted his voice of thunder,"
5038,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the palace toppled down.
5039,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Oh! he roared so loud
5040,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That the frightened crowd
5041,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Fled from the tumbling town,"
5042,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the thankless monarch stumbled,"
5043,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And fell, and broke his crown."
5044,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And forth from his firelit cavern
5045,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Did the giant peep and grin,"
5046,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then growled at the fay beside him—
5047,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Does _that_ please Winnikin?”
5048,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5049,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And such were the fairy’s errands,"
5050,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",As from time to time she came
5051,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","To Jungenthor the giant,"
5052,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Feeding the flood of flame;
5053,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And such were the tales she told him
5054,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Of trouble, and wrong, and grief,"
5055,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And thus and so
5056,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Would the giant go
5057,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To Winnikin’s relief.
5058,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5059,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Once came the fairy, weeping,"
5060,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“O Jungenthor!” said she,"
5061,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“O mighty giant, listen"
5062,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To the news I bring to thee.
5063,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5064,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“All up among the mountains,"
5065,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Amid the forests dim,"
5066,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","There stands a ruined castle,"
5067,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",A castle old and grim:
5068,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And in its shade at evening
5069,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The elves are wont to meet,"
5070,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To dance upon the mosses
5071,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And sway with lilies sweet.
5072,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Well, yestere’en, it happened,"
5073,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Just at the midnight hour,"
5074,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","While we were making merry,"
5075,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Forth from the vine-wreathed tower
5076,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","There came a plaintive moaning,"
5077,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And I alone who heard
5078,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Flew up the twining ivy,"
5079,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","As lightly as a bird,"
5080,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And found on high a dungeon
5081,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Beneath the shattered roof,"
5082,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And there a pale young captive
5083,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","From mortal aid aloof,"
5084,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","By heavy, clanking irons"
5085,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Chained to the wall of stone.
5086,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O Jungenthor, good reason"
5087,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Has he to weep and moan!
5088,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And this is what he told me,"
5089,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And this is what he told;
5090,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Now hear, O mighty giant,"
5091,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",What fiends the earth doth hold:
5092,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5093,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“‘All up a mountain pathway,"
5094,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","That winds through forests green,"
5095,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",There rode three gallant horsemen
5096,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And nevermore were seen.
5097,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Three other gallant horsemen
5098,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Rode up in search of them,"
5099,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Rode up the narrow pathway—
5100,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And came not back again.
5101,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And after went three others
5102,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The mountain searching o’er—
5103,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",It fared with those three others
5104,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",As with them that went before.
5105,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And all the people marveled,"
5106,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And all were filled with fear,"
5107,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And no one dared to venture
5108,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The mountain pathway near.
5109,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5110,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“‘Now, one of those nine horsemen"
5111,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Was a knight of our good King;
5112,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And so a prize he offered
5113,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To any who should bring
5114,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",A true report and trusty
5115,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Of all those hapless men
5116,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Who ventured up the mountain
5117,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And ne’er came down again.
5118,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Whoso should dare the pathway
5119,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And bring a true report,"
5120,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Thus he should be rewarded—
5121,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Oh, he should dwell at court,"
5122,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And all should do him honor,"
5123,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the King should make him knight,"
5124,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And give to him a war-horse
5125,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And a suit of armor bright!
5126,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5127,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“‘Now, we are seven brothers,"
5128,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","So hale, and strong, and tall,"
5129,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Save me, who am the seventh,"
5130,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The youngest of them all;
5131,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And for my lowly stature,"
5132,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Fair face, and yellow curls,"
5133,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The rest they loved to taunt me
5134,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And tease the livelong day,"
5135,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The while we watched the cattle
5136,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Or turned the new-mown hay.
5137,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Go hence, go hence, fair lily,"
5138,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And haste thee,” they would say;"
5139,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Lest thou shouldst tan or freckle
5140,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Beneath the burning sun,"
5141,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Go get thyself a bonnet
5142,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","To shield thee, gentle one!"
5143,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Go gossip with old women!
5144,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Go spin and sew with girls!”

5149,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","What brave deed I might do,"
5150,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Their cruel scorn to silence;
5151,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And when I heard the news,"

5154,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","So, thro’ the brooding midnight,"
5155,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The while the others slept,"
5156,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Across the fields and pastures
5157,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",All silently I crept;
5158,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And when mine eyes I lifted
5159,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","At breaking of the day,"
5160,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I saw afar the mountain,"
5161,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Toward which I took my way.
5162,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And on, and on I journeyed,"
5163,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Till, just as night came down,"
5164,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",I passed into the forest
5165,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Among the shadows brown.
5166,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then up the winding pathway
5167,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I hurried on, in fear,"
5168,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","’Till, through the darkness shining"
5169,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Forth from a ruin near,"
5170,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","A light I spied, and thither"
5171,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I turned, in hope I might"
5172,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Find food—for I was hungry—
5173,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And shelter for the night.
5174,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I reached the door, and ent’ring"
5175,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","(I thought the place an inn,"
5176,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For there were sounds of feasting
5177,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And merriment within),"
5178,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Fierce men, with cruel weapons,"
5179,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","A table gathered ’round,"
5180,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Sprang up and seized me, helpless,"
5181,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And with these fetters bound.
5182,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“What brings thee here, thou stripling?”"
5183,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",In anger questioned they.
5184,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“O sirs,” I answered, trembling,"
5185,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“I’ve journeyed all the day;
5186,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","For food, and rest, and shelter"
5187,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I chanced to turn this way,"
5188,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","But since I am not welcome,"
5189,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Let me pass on, I pray.”"
5190,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5191,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Ha, not so fast, young villain!"
5192,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",We know that is a lie.
5193,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",What errand brings thee hither?
5194,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Confess thou art a spy!”
5195,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“It is a peaceful errand,"
5196,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O sirs,” I answered then;"
5197,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“I seek nine gallant horsemen.
5198,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And have ye heard of them?
5199,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","They rode this way, nor ever"
5200,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Returned, and I would bring"
5201,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Some tidings of the missing
5202,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","To our good lord, the King.”"
5203,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","At that, with peals of laughter"
5204,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The dreary place did ring.
5205,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Thou’lt see thy gallant horsemen
5206,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Ere thou shalt see the King!”
5207,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","They said, and roughly dragged me"
5208,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Along the banquet-hall,"
5209,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And up into this lonesome tower,"
5210,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And chained me to the wall.
5211,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Lie there, lie there and rest thee!”"
5212,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",They cried in mocking tones;
5213,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Thou’rt welcome to thy lodging—
5214,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the lichens on the stones!”
5215,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5216,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“‘O fairy, now for many days"
5217,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Have I thus helpless lain;
5218,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","No food but these gray mosses,"
5219,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",No drink but pearls of rain
5220,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That through the sunken ceiling
5221,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Drop to me where I lie,"
5222,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",When the blessed clouds in pity
5223,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Creep downward from the sky.
5224,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O fairy, I beseech thee,"
5225,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Release me ere I die!
5226,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For they who keep this castle
5227,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Are robbers fierce and bold,"
5228,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",I’ve learned from bloody stories
5229,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","By one and other told,"
5230,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","As night by night, grown merry"
5231,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With wine, their voices rise,"
5232,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And come to me with secrets
5233,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Through the long galleries.
5234,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",They gather here at midnight
5235,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","From all the country o’er,"
5236,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To hide their plundered treasure
5237,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Beneath the stone-paved floor,"
5238,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To talk of their adventures
5239,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And feast till break of day,"
5240,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","When quick they mount their horses,"
5241,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And swiftly ride away
5242,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",To seek the mountain-passes
5243,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And lie in wait for prey.
5244,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The very steeds that bear them
5245,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Were stolen, and they tell"
5246,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Of three who once rode hither,"
5247,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","On whom they, waiting, fell"
5248,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And slew, and of three others"
5249,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Who up the mountain came,"
5250,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And yet again three others;
5251,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And all did fare the same.
5252,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And now—for who could doubt it?—
5253,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Those were the missing nine!
5254,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Oh! I would bear the tidings,"
5255,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The prize it should be mine,"
5256,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",But that thus bound with irons
5257,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And helpless here I lie.
5258,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Good fairy, I beseech thee,"
5259,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Release me ere I die!’
5260,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5261,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Such was the tale he told me.
5262,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O Jungenthor, I plead"
5263,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That thou wilt lift thy mighty arm
5264,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And help him in his need.”
5265,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5266,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","When the fairy had finished speaking,"
5267,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The giant stood up and knocked
5268,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Again and again on the ceiling,"
5269,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Till the ruined castle rocked,"
5270,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the roof fell in
5271,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With a deafening din,"
5272,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the stones fell out
5273,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And tumbled about;
5274,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the thieves who merrily feasted,"
5275,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Or ever they could take flight,"
5276,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","The earth gaped wide and swallowed,"
5277,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then closed and covered from sight.
5278,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Ha, ha!” laughed Giant Jungenthor,"
5279,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“Haven’t I served them right?”
5280,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5281,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",But there was one part of the castle—
5282,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The tow’r where the young lad lay—
5283,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Left standing (and who denieth
5284,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",That it stands there to this day?)
5285,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The door it had flown wide open
5286,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","At the knocking of Jungenthor,"
5287,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The iron chain
5288,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","It had snapped in twain,"
5289,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the captive was free once more.
5290,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5291,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And still in his clanking fetters,"
5292,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Wasted, and weak, and wan,"
5293,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","He crawled away to the forest,"
5294,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He wandered and wandered on.
5295,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Bewildered and faint, all slowly"
5296,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Here and there did he stray,"
5297,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Till he saw a snow-white charger,"
5298,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","With saddle and trappings gay,"
5299,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Feeding among the herbage,"
5300,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And him did he mount straightway,"
5301,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Saying, “Good steed,"
5302,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","O speed, O speed!"
5303,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And carry me, carry me, carry me"
5304,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Safe to the King this day!”
5305,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5306,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Then the beautiful snow-white charger,"
5307,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","As tho’ he had understood,"
5308,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Galloped adown the mountain,"
5309,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Down and on through the wood;
5310,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And, eager, as one long absent"
5311,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Seeking his home again,"
5312,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The road to the royal city
5313,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He took when he reached the plain;
5314,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the folk in the fields at labor,"
5315,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the passers to and fro,"
5316,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Lifted their eyes in wonder,"
5317,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Seeing him speeding so—
5318,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",For ever the farther he traveled
5319,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The faster he seemed to go.
5320,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5321,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The King from the palace window
5322,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Looked forth at set of sun,"
5323,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And along the dusty highway
5324,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Saw a horse and rider come;
5325,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And he watched till the snow-white charger
5326,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Paused at the palace gate,"
5327,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Then he turned to the courtiers round him,"
5328,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Saying in wonder great,"
5329,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Look, ye! it is the war horse"
5330,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Of my brave knight, Harald, he"
5331,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Who rode on the fated mission.
5332,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Bring the rider to me!”
5333,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5334,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And into the royal presence,"
5335,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Trembling, the young lad came,"
5336,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Wasted, and wan, and pallid,"
5337,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Feebly dragging his chain.
5338,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Who art thou?” the King demanded,"
5339,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Marveling at the sight;
5340,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Whence dost thou come, and wherefore,"
5341,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And why in this woeful plight?”
5342,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5343,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then the youth made timid answer—
5344,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“O my gracious lord the King,"
5345,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I am a humble peasant,"
5346,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And tidings I come to bring
5347,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Of the fate of the missing horsemen.”
5348,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Bidding the lad come near,"
5349,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Eager the King did question,"
5350,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the courtiers all,"
5351,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Both great and small,"
5352,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Crowded about to hear.
5353,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5354,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",When the boy had told his story
5355,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The King laid hand on his head;—
5356,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",“If thou wert but ten years older
5357,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","I would make thee a knight,” he said."
5358,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Alas!” sighed the boy, recalling"
5359,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The scorn and the cruel jeers
5360,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Of his brothers, “I am not worthy,"
5361,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Because of my youthful years!”
5362,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And wasted, and weak, and pallid,"
5363,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","He sank with a weary moan,"
5364,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","His fetters clanking around him,"
5365,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",There at the foot of the throne.
5366,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Then the King’s fair little daughter,"
5367,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Who had listened with tearful eyes,"
5368,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Spake softly, “Have pity, my father!"
5369,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Hath he not won the prize?”
5370,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5371,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Arise!” said the good King, smiling,"
5372,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Forsooth I will keep my word,”"
5373,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","(And, saying, the young lad’s shoulder"
5374,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Lightly he touched with his sword);
5375,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Forsooth I will keep my promise,"
5376,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Since the little one pleads thy claim!
5377,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Henceforth shall they know thee only
5378,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",As the Knight of the Golden Mane.
5379,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The steed that hath borne thee hither
5380,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Henceforward thine own shall be,"
5381,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And when thou art grown to fit it
5382,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Mine armor I’ll give to thee.”
5383,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Then to the servitors turning—
5384,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","“Unbind him without delay,"
5385,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Tho’ these chains were a badge of honor
5386,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And clanked in his praise to-day.”
5387,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5388,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the youthful knight thereafter
5389,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","At the court of the King abode,"
5390,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Like a prince did he go appareled,"
5391,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the snow-white steed he rode.
5392,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the King’s own suit of armor
5393,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",He wore when a man he grew—
5394,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Helmet, and shield, and coat of mail,"
5395,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the good King’s broad-sword, too."
5396,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And so valiant was he in warfare,"
5397,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And so wise alway, that his fame"
5398,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Afar did ring,"
5399,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And the foes of the King
5400,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Trembled to hear his name.
5401,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5402,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Now, once to the royal city"
5403,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",The people by thousands came
5404,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","(For that day did he wed the princess,"
5405,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",She who pleaded his claim);
5406,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And there were six stalwart brothers
5407,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","In the gay and festive throng,"
5408,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",And low did they make obeisance
5409,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",As grandly he rode along;
5410,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","But sudden, amazed and awe-struck"
5411,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Were they when the warrior bold—
5412,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","In his bright and dazzling armor,"
5413,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",With his flowing locks of gold—
5414,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Halted to give them greeting;
5415,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Sudden they blanched with shame,"
5416,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","For, behold, their long-lost brother"
5417,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Was the Knight of the Golden Mane!
5418,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",
5419,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And none of all this had happened,"
5420,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the castle, so grim and gray,"
5421,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Might have been the home of robbers
5422,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Unto this very day;
5423,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And the poor young lad imprisoned,"
5424,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","Bound by the iron chain,"
5425,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Had clambered the lonely mountain
5426,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And tried for the prize in vain,"
5427,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",But for the giant’s knocking.
5428,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","And from this and from that you see,"
5429,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.","When the fairy asked help of Jungenthor,"
5430,"JUNGENTHOR, THE GIANT.",Just the way it would be—

5574,LITTLE FLORENCE.,
5575,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"And now the door closed on her,"
5576,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"As yesterday, no doubt—"

5579,LITTLE FLORENCE.,
5580,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"Once, left alone a moment,"

5584,LITTLE FLORENCE.,
5585,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"Nor here, nor there, the missing;"
5586,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"The neighbors, looking out,"
5587,LITTLE FLORENCE.,Saw all the household flying
5588,LITTLE FLORENCE.,"Promiscuously about,"

5594,LITTLE FLORENCE.,
5595,LITTLE FLORENCE.,“O Florence! Florence! Florence!”
5596,LITTLE FLORENCE.,There came a little squeal

5605,LITTLE FLORENCE.,But bless the little cherubs
