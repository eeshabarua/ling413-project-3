90,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.
91,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
92,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
93,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. This
94,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"shoe stood near a great forest, and was so large that it served as a"
95,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"house for the Old Lady and all her children, of which she had so many"
96,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,that she did not know what to do with them.
97,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
98,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,[Illustration: Old Woman with children and Shoe.]
99,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
100,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"But the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children, and they only"
101,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"thought of the best way to please her. Strong-arm, the eldest, cut"
102,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,down trees for firewood. Peter made baskets of wicker-work. Mark was
103,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"chief gardener. Lizzie milked the cow, and Jenny taught the younger"
104,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,children to read.
105,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
106,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,Now this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe. She and
107,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy, and her"
108,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"husband was a wood-cutter, like Strong-arm. But there lived in a huge"
109,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"castle beyond the forest, a fierce giant, who one day came and laid"
110,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,their house in ruins with his club; after which he carried off the
111,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,poor wood-cutter to his castle beyond the forest. When the Little Old
112,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Woman came home, her house was in ruins and her husband was no where"
113,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,to be seen.
114,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
115,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,[Illustration: Giant holding Wood-cutter.]
116,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
117,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Night came on, and as the father did not return, the Old Lady and her"
118,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,family went to search for him. When they came to that part of the
119,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"wood where the Giant had met their father, they saw an immense shoe."
120,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father, but"
121,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,met with no reply. Then the Old Lady thought that they had better
122,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house. So Peter
123,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"and Strong-arm put a roof to it, and cut a door, and turned it into a"
124,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"dwelling. Here they all lived happily for many years, but the Little"
125,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate. Strong-arm, who"
126,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"saw how wretched his mother often was about it, proposed to the next"
127,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father
128,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"free from the Giant. Their mother knew the Giant's strength, and"
129,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"would not hear of the attempt, as she feared they would be killed."
130,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"But Strong-arm was not afraid. He bought a dozen sharp swords, and"
131,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Peter made as many strong shields and helmets, as well as cross-bows"
132,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,and iron-headed arrows. They were now quite ready; Strong-arm gave
133,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"the order to march, and they started for the forest. The next day"
134,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"they came in sight of the Giant's Castle. Strong-arm, leaving his"
135,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"brothers in a wood close by, strode boldly up to the entrance, and"
136,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,seized the knocker. The door was opened by a funny little boy with a
137,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"large head, who kept grinning and laughing."
138,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
139,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,[Illustration: Strong-arm and Boy with Large Head.]
140,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
141,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Strong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard, and presently"
142,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"met a page, who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted."
143,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father, who was kept a"
144,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,prisoner by the Giant; on this the little man said he was sorry for
145,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"him, because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was"
146,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"guarded by a large dragon. Strong-arm, nothing daunted, soon found"
147,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"the monster, who was fast asleep, so he made short work of him by"
148,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"sending his sword right through his heart; at which he jumped up,"
149,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"uttering a loud scream, and made as if he would spring forward and"
150,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"seize Strong-arm; but the good sword had done its work, and the"
151,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"monster fell heavily on the ground, dead."
152,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
153,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,[Illustration: Strong-arm killing Dragon.]
154,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
155,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Now the Giant, who had been drinking much wine, was fast asleep in a"
156,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,remote part of the castle. Strong-arm had no sooner finished the
157,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Dragon, than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door."
158,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"He led Strong-arm round to another part of the court-yard, where he"
159,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"saw his poor father, who at once sprung to his feet, and embraced"
160,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"him. Then Strong-arm called up his brothers, and when they had"
161,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"embraced their father, they soon broke his chain and set him"
162,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,free.
163,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
164,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,We must now return to the Little Old Woman. After her sons had
165,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,started she gave way to the most bitter grief. While she was in this
166,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"state, an old witch came up to her, and said she would help her, as"
167,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"she hated the Giant, and wished to kill him. The Old Witch then took"
168,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"the little Old Lady on her broom, and they sailed off through the"
169,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"air, straight to the Giant's castle."
170,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
171,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,[Illustration: Witch and Lady on broom.]
172,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,
173,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"Now this old Witch had great power, and at once afflicted the Giant"
174,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,with corns and tender feet. When he awoke from his sleep he was in
175,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"such pain that he could bear it no longer, so he thought he would go"
176,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"in search of his missing shoe, which, like the other one he had in"
177,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"his castle, was easy and large for his foot. When he came to the"
178,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"spot where the Old Lady and her children lived, he saw his old shoe,"
179,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"and with a laugh that shook the trees, he thrust his foot into it,"
180,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,breaking through the roof that Strong-arm and Peter had put to it.
181,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"The children, in great alarm, rushed about inside the shoe, and"
182,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"frightened and trembling, scrambled through the door and the slits"
183,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,which the Giant had formerly made for his corns. By this time the
184,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"witch and the Little Old Lady, as also Strong-arm, his eleven"
185,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"brother and his father, were come up to the spot. Strong-arm and his"
186,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded, when"
187,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,Strong-arm went up to him and cut off his head. Then the father and
188,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,"the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house, and"
189,THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.,lived happily ever afterwards.

197,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
198,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,A gentleman of good account
199,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"In Norfolk dwelt of late,"
200,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Whose wealth and riches did surmount
201,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Most men of his estate.
202,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
203,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Sore sick he was, and like to die,"
204,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,No help his life could save;
205,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"His wife by him as sick did lie,"
206,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And both were near the grave.
207,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
208,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,No love between these two was lost:
209,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Each to the other kind;
210,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"In love they lived, in love they died,"
211,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And left two babes behind.
212,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
213,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Now if the children chanced to die,"
214,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Ere they to age should come,"
215,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Their uncle should possess their wealth:
216,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,For so the will did run.
217,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
218,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""Now brother,"" said the dying man,"
219,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""Look to my children dear;"
220,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Be good unto my boy and girl,"
221,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"No friend else have they here."""
222,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
223,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: Babes and Uncle at death-bed.]
224,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
225,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Their parents being dead and gone,"
226,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The children home he takes,"
227,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And brings them both unto his house,"
228,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Where much of them he makes.
229,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
230,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,He had not kept these pretty babes
231,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"A twelvemonth and a day,"
232,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"When, for their wealth, he did devise"
233,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,To make them both away.
234,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
235,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"He bargain'd with two ruffians bold,"
236,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Who were of savage mood,"
237,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"That they should take the children twain,"
238,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,And slay them in a wood.
239,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
240,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,They prate and prattle pleasantly
241,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"While riding on the way,"
242,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"To those their wicked uncle hired,"
243,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,These lovely babes to slay:
244,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
245,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: Babes and Ruffians on horse-back.]
246,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
247,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"So that the pretty speech they had,"
248,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Made the ruffians' heart relent;
249,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And they that took the deed to do,"
250,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Full sorely did repent.
251,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
252,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Yet one of them, more hard of heart,"
253,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Did vow to do his charge,"
254,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Because the wretch that hired him
255,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Had paid him very large.
256,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
257,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"The other would not agree thereto,"
258,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,So here they fell at strife;
259,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"With one another they did fight,"
260,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,About the children's life:
261,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
262,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And he that was of milder mood,"
263,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Did slay the other there,"
264,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Within an unfrequented wood;
265,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The babes did quake for fear!
266,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
267,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: Ruffian being killed.]
268,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
269,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"He took the children by the hand,"
270,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,While they for bread complain:
271,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"""Stay here,"" said he, ""I'll bring ye bread,"
272,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"When I do come again."""
273,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
274,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"These pretty babes, with hand in hand,"
275,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Went wandering up and down;
276,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"But never more they saw the man,"
277,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Approaching from the town:
278,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
279,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,[Illustration: Babes wandering.]
280,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
281,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Thus wander'd these two pretty dears,"
282,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Till death did end their grief;
283,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"In one another's arms they died,"
284,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Poor babes, past all relief:"
285,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
286,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,No burial these innocents
287,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Of any man receives,"
288,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,But robin red-breast lovingly
289,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Did cover them with leaves.

293,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The fellow that did take in hand
294,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"These children for to kill,"
295,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"Was for a robbery judged to die,"
296,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,As was God's blessed will:
297,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,
298,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,"And did confess the very truth,"
299,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,The which is here express'd;
300,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Their uncle died while he for debt
301,THE BABES IN THE WOOD.,Did long in prison rest.

309,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
310,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"""Little Bo-Peep she lost her sheep"
311,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,And didn't know where to find them.
312,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"Let them alone, and they'll come home,"
313,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"And bring their tails behind them!"""
314,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
315,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,[Illustration: Bo-peep searching.]
316,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
317,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,So runs the Nursery Rhyme. Little Bo-Peep was a very nice little
318,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"girl. Her cheeks had a bloom on them like a lovely peach, and her"
319,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,voice sounded like a sweet silver bell.
320,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
321,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"But though Little Bo-Peep was as good as she was beautiful, she"
322,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"sometimes met with misfortunes that made her very sad. Once, when she"
323,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"lost her sheep, she was very doleful indeed. And this is how it"
324,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,happened.
325,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
326,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"One summer evening, when the sun was setting, Little Bo-Peep, who had"
327,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"to rise very early in the morning, felt tired, and sat down on a bank"
328,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,covered with daisies. Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep. Now
329,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was a most stupid and stubborn
330,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,fellow. I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow
331,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"the Bell-wether, and that he always wears a bell round his neck. It"
332,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"was a great pity, but the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was very"
333,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"wild, and was much given to wander far away into the wood, where of"
334,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,course the rest of the sheep would follow him.
335,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
336,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"Finding Little Bo-Peep asleep, the tiresome fellow began by standing"
337,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on
338,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"the grass. After this he whirled himself round like a top, shaking"
339,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"his head all the time, and ringing his bell."
340,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
341,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,[Illustration: Bo-Peep asleep; Bell-wether capering.]
342,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
343,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,Very soon the rest of the flock began to dance and caper too. And
344,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"when they had wheeled round their leader for a time, they ran off"
345,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"after him with a bound into the wood. Away they went, till they were"
346,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"quite tired out; and then they came to a stand-still, staring at their"
347,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,leader with very blank faces. But the Bell-wether looked foolish
348,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"enough now, and did nothing but shake his head slowly and ring his"
349,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"bell, which seemed to say quite clearly, ""You are lost, you are"
350,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"lost!"""
351,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
352,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"When Little Bo-Peep awoke she found her sheep gone, and hardly"
353,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"knowing what she did, she walked on and on, far into the wood. She"
354,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands, and asked them if"
355,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"they had seen her sheep. But they only laughed at her, and said, No."
356,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"One man was very cross, and threatened to beat her. At last she came"
357,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"to a stile, on which an old Raven was perched. He looked so wise that"
358,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,Little Bo-Peep asked him whether he had seen a flock of sheep. But he
359,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"only cried ""Caw, caw, caw;"" so Bo-Peep ran on again across the"
360,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,fields.
361,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
362,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,[Illustration: Bo-peep and Raven.]
363,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
364,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"She wandered on till night-fall, and being faint with hunger, was"
365,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"very glad to see a light just before her. As she went on, she saw"
366,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"that it shone from a cottage window. But when she came to the door,"
367,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in, and was"
368,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"just going to run away, when a cross-looking old woman came out, and"
369,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,dragged her into the cottage. She made her sit by the side of her
370,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"son, who was a very ugly youth with a great red face and red"
371,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,hair.

375,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"The old woman told him that she had brought Bo-Peep to be his wife,"
376,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"so Bo-Peep, who did not like him at all, ran away while they were"
377,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"asleep. But she did not know where to go, and gave herself up for"
378,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"lost, when she heard something cry, ""tu-whit--tu-whoo,"" in the"
379,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"tree above her. It was a great owl, which began flapping its wings"
380,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"with joy. Bo-Peep was frightened at first, but as the owl seemed very"
381,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"kind, she followed it. It took her to a cottage were there was plenty"
382,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"to eat and drink, and then, to Bo-Peep's great surprise, it began to"
383,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"speak, and told her this story:--"
384,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
385,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"""Know, dear Maiden,"" said the owl, ""that I am the daughter of a King,"
386,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,and was a lovely Princess; but I was changed into an owl by the old
387,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"woman at the cottage, because I would not marry her ugly son. But I"
388,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden, who would"
389,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"come into this wood to find her lost sheep, should be the means of my"
390,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"gaining my own form again. You are that pretty maid, and I will take"
391,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"you to a spot where you will find your sheep, but without their"
392,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"tails. The elves will play with them for this night, but in the"
393,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"morning every sheep will have its tail again, except the stupid"
394,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"Bell-wether. You must then wave his tail three times over my head,"
395,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"and I shall resume my shape again."""
396,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
397,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"The owl flew off, and led Bo-Peep into the wood, and said, ""Sleep,"
398,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"maiden, I will watch."" How long she was asleep she could not tell,"
399,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up, and she saw the Queen"
400,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,of the Fairies seated on a bank. The Queen said the sheep should be
401,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,punished for running away. She then saw all her sheep come trooping
402,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"into the place, and on every sheep there was an Elf, who held in his"
403,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,hand a sheep's tail.
404,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,

406,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,
407,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"After riding them about for some time, and having great fun with"
408,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"them, the mad sport ceased, and each Elf restored the tail to his"
409,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"sheep--all but the Bell-wether's, which their leader hid in a"
410,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"tree. When Bo-Peep awoke, she saw the owl flapping its wings as if"
411,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"to remind her of her promise; so she fetched the tail, and waved it"
412,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"three times over its head, when up started the most charming Princess"
413,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,"that ever was seen. The princess gave Bo-Peep a beautiful cottage,"
414,LITTLE BO-PEEP.,and her sheep never ran away from their kind mistress again.

426,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,
427,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"There was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their"
428,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"mother, loved them all very dearly. Some of these little pigs were"
429,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her. The eldest"
430,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig. One day he
431,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"went to market with his cart full of vegetables, but Rusty, the"
432,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"donkey, began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on"
433,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,the road. All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move. So
434,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts, and being very strong, drew the"
435,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"cart to market himself. When he got there, all the other pigs began"
436,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,to laugh. But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them
437,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,all his struggles on the road. Mr. Pig lost no time in selling
438,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the"
439,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"market-place, and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the"
440,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay. When he got there, he"
441,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy"
442,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,son.

448,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he"
449,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother"
450,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she"
451,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,went out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was
452,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"alone, instead of learning his lessons, he began to tease the poor"
453,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as"
454,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"to see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out,"
455,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,he began to cry. After this he broke all his brother's toys; he
456,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the"
457,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"kite, and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the"
458,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by"
459,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep. No sooner had"
460,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"she done so, than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and"
461,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,tied her in her chair. But soon she awoke and found out all the
462,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,mischief that he had been doing. She saw at once the damage that he
463,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,had done to his brother's playthings. So she quickly brought out her
464,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a"
465,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,beating as he did not forget for a long time.

473,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,This little pig was a very good and careful fellow. He gave his
474,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"mother scarcely any trouble, and always took a pleasure in doing all"
475,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,she bade him. Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and
476,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"face, to some nice roast beef, while his brother, the idle pig, who"
477,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"is standing on a stool in the corner, with the dunce's cap on, has"
478,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"none. He sat down and quietly learned his lesson, and asked his"
479,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,mother to hear him repeat it. And this he did so well that Mrs. Pig
480,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"stroked him on the ears and forehead, and called him a good little"
481,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,pig. After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea.
482,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"He brought everything she wanted, and lifted off the kettle from"
483,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"the fire, without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet."
484,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"By-and-bye he went out, after asking his mother's leave, to play with"
485,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"his hoop. He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig, who, with"
486,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog; so he put his
487,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor
488,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,old pig. It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother
489,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,often gave this little pig roast beef. We now come to the little pig
490,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,who had none.

496,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,This was a most obstinate and wilful little pig. His mother had set
497,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"him to learn his lesson, but no sooner had she gone out into the"
498,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"garden, than he tore his book into pieces. When his mother came back"
499,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like
500,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,himself. After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a
501,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"sound thrashing. Being afraid to go home, he stayed out till it was"
502,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,quite dark and caught a severe cold. So he was taken home and put to
503,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"bed, and had to take a lot of nasty physic."

513,THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.,"while he was trying to carry it home, Farmer Grumpey came running"

526,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a
527,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"very good lad, and although he was not handsome, he was good-tempered"
528,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"and industrious, and this made him better-looking than half the other"
529,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"boys. Old Mother Goose carried a long stick, she wore a high-crowned"
530,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"hat, and high-heeled shoes, and her kerchief was as white as snow."
531,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond, and the Owl that sat"
532,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. But what a
533,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,fine strong fellow the Gander was! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted
534,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"to take a journey, she would mount upon his broad strong back, and"
535,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance.

537,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,[Illustration: Mother Goose and Gander flying.]
538,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
539,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely;
540,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could
541,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"find. It was early in the morning when he started, and his way lay"
542,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers; so on he went, with his"
543,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,Mother's great clothes-prop over his shoulder. The fresh morning air
544,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"caused Jack's spirits to rise. He left the road, and plunged into the"
545,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his"
546,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made
547,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"many attempts to find the path again, he heard a scream. He jumped up"
548,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an
549,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a
550,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his
551,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"staff Jack sent the thief howling away, and then went back to the"
552,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"young lady, who was lying on the ground, crying."
553,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
554,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,[Illustration: Jack and young lady.]
555,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
556,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off,"
557,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was
558,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"the daughter of the Squire, who lived in the great white house on the"
559,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"hill-top. She knew the path out of the wood quite well, and when they"
560,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"reached the border, she said that Jack must come soon to her father's"
561,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"house, so that he might thank him for his noble conduct."
562,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
563,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"When Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the"
564,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose,"
565,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left."
566,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the"
567,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"road, made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be"
568,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"carried; and then, when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a"
569,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"short time, she tried to fly away; so Jack seized her in his arms and"
570,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,kept her there till he reached home.
571,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
572,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,[Illustration: Jack carrying Goose.]
573,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
574,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird
575,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,Jack had bought; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe.
576,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would
577,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had
578,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"rescued in the forest, and soon began to sigh all day long. He"
579,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"neglected the garden, cared no more for the Gander, and scarcely even"
580,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"noticed the beautiful Goose. But one morning, as he was walking by"
581,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"the pond, he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise,"
582,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was
583,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to
584,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"his mother, who said, ""Go to market, my son; sell your egg, and you"
585,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire."" So to market"
586,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"Jack went, and sold his golden egg; but the rogue who bought it of"
587,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his
588,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"finest clothes, and went up to the Squire's house. Two footmen stood"
589,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"at the door, one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy"
590,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,and stupid.
591,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
592,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,[Illustration: Jack and Footmen.]
593,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
594,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"When Jack asked to see the Squire, they laughed at him, and made"
595,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,sport of his fine clothes; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each
596,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"a guinea, when they at once showed him to the Squire's room."
597,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,
598,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"Now the Squire, who was very rich, was also very proud and fat, and"
599,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,scarcely turned his head to notice Jack; but when he showed him his
600,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"bag of gold, and asked for his daughter to be his bride, the Squire"
601,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the"
602,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"horse-pond. But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and"
603,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to
604,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever,"
605,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did
606,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she
607,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer"
608,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated
609,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself.
610,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at"
611,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law. Then Old Mother
612,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander,"
613,THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.,"leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride, who lived"
