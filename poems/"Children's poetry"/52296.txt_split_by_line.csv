1295,LONGFELLOW.,
1296,LONGFELLOW.,
1297,LONGFELLOW.,MORE than a century ago there lived in England an orphan boy of no
1298,LONGFELLOW.,"ordinary promise. From his early childhood, “I want to be a minister,”"
1299,LONGFELLOW.,was his chief desire. Being deprived not only of the counsel of a
1300,LONGFELLOW.,"father and the affection of a mother, but also of the necessary amount"
1301,LONGFELLOW.,"of money to carry out his cherished desire, his youthful spirit was"
1302,LONGFELLOW.,"bowed to the earth, and his noble heart throbbed only with feelings of"
1303,LONGFELLOW.,bitter disappointment and despair.
1304,LONGFELLOW.,
1305,LONGFELLOW.,But a brighter day dawns. There is a prospect for his ardent desire
1306,LONGFELLOW.,to be gratified. A wealthy lady kindly volunteers to pay all of his
1307,LONGFELLOW.,"expenses at the University of Oxford, if he will become a minister of"
1308,LONGFELLOW.,the Church of England.
1309,LONGFELLOW.,
1310,LONGFELLOW.,"But he is a Dissenter, and his noble spirit refuses to sell the"
1311,LONGFELLOW.,religion of his father and mother for the perishable riches of this
1312,LONGFELLOW.,"world, and he most respectfully declines the proffered kindness. God"
1313,LONGFELLOW.,"bless thee, noble youth! Wait patiently—don’t despair—_never give"
1314,LONGFELLOW.,"up_. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” The path of Duty is always"
1315,LONGFELLOW.,the path of Right.
1316,LONGFELLOW.,
1317,LONGFELLOW.,"Not long after this occurrence, a poor boy, dressed in the garb of"
1318,LONGFELLOW.,"poverty, presented himself at the door of a celebrated minister, and"
1319,LONGFELLOW.,asked to have a private interview with him relative to studying for
1320,LONGFELLOW.,the ministry. The minister listened patiently to the recital of his
1321,LONGFELLOW.,"many difficulties and numerous trials, but told him that he thought it"
1322,LONGFELLOW.,"entirely unheard of, for a youth like himself to think about entering"
1323,LONGFELLOW.,upon so high and responsible a calling. He advised him to think no more
1324,LONGFELLOW.,"of preaching, but to choose some other calling."
1325,LONGFELLOW.,
1326,LONGFELLOW.,"Disheartened at himself, discouraged by his friends, poor, penniless"
1327,LONGFELLOW.,"and forsaken, he knew not whither to go. No smile of encouragement met"
1328,LONGFELLOW.,his eye; no voice of approval sanctioned his noble endeavor. There was
1329,LONGFELLOW.,"one Friend, however, who had never forsaken him; who had never turned"
1330,LONGFELLOW.,a deaf ear even to his smallest desire; who had ever loved him with
1331,LONGFELLOW.,fatherly affection and motherly tenderness. To that friend he then
1332,LONGFELLOW.,"betook himself, and when engaged in fervent prayer, a postman knocked"
1333,LONGFELLOW.,"at the door, and handed him a letter from an old friend of his father,"
1334,LONGFELLOW.,informing him of his willingness to take him under his care and assist
1335,LONGFELLOW.,"him in his studies, if he was still intent upon studying for the"
1336,LONGFELLOW.,"ministry. “This,” he exclaimed, “I look upon almost as an answer from"
1337,LONGFELLOW.,"Heaven, and while I live I shall always adore so seasonable an opening"
1338,LONGFELLOW.,of divine Providence.”
1339,LONGFELLOW.,
1340,LONGFELLOW.,The wishes of the poor orphan boy were thus gratified; and before
1341,LONGFELLOW.,"many years had passed away, under the guidance and instruction of his"
1342,LONGFELLOW.,"friend, he became a bright and shining light on the walls of Zion."
1343,LONGFELLOW.,
1344,LONGFELLOW.,"Youthful reader, this orphan boy was PHILIP DODDRIDGE—the pious and"
1345,LONGFELLOW.,"devoted minister of Christ, the beautiful writer, the faithful pastor,"

1348,LONGFELLOW.,"If there be any one into whose hands this little article may fall,"
1349,LONGFELLOW.,"who, like Doddridge, “wants to be a minister,” and is prevented from"

1351,LONGFELLOW.,"word—_never despair!_ If God wants you to be a minister, He will"

1719,LONGFELLOW.,of perfect insensibility he is taken up and borne to the arms of

1721,LONGFELLOW.,"unconsciousness, not knowing the nearest and dearest of his relatives."

1764,LONGFELLOW.,
1765,LONGFELLOW.,During this tour he gathered a vast amount of information relative

1786,LONGFELLOW.,"of the world-famed Editor of the Biblical Encyclopædia, the Pictorial"
1787,LONGFELLOW.,"Bible, the Daily Bible Illustrations. He reached, through incredible"
1788,LONGFELLOW.,"difficulties, a position that few attain under the most favorable"

1790,LONGFELLOW.,which take high rank as works of critical authority. Truly the heroic

1937,“DELAY NOT.”,if she would ask me to take a seat. This she did not do; and feeling
1938,“DELAY NOT.”,that I had a matter of more importance than politeness to attend
1939,“DELAY NOT.”,to—_her soul’s welfare_—I sat down on the remains of what was once a
1940,“DELAY NOT.”,"chair, and commenced the following conversation:"
1941,“DELAY NOT.”,
1942,“DELAY NOT.”,“Are you a Christian?” “No.” “Do you ever expect or hope to be a
1943,“DELAY NOT.”,_Christian_?” “No.” “Have you ever felt the workings of God’s Spirit
1944,“DELAY NOT.”,"upon your heart?” “Never, since a child.” “Have you at any period"
1945,“DELAY NOT.”,"in your past life ever read your Bible?” “Yes, I read it when a"
1946,“DELAY NOT.”,school-girl.” “Did you not see a peculiar beauty and simplicity in
1947,“DELAY NOT.”,"it?” “I did not.” “Do you believe in the Bible?” “Yes,” she angrily"
1948,“DELAY NOT.”,"replied, “_I believe it to be a lie from beginning to end_.” “Have you"
1949,“DELAY NOT.”,ever read any other books besides the Bible?” “I have read Bunyan’s
1950,“DELAY NOT.”,"Pilgrim’s Progress, and believe that he was as complete a liar as ever"
1951,“DELAY NOT.”,"lived, and never experienced one feeling described in that book, but"
1952,“DELAY NOT.”,"wrote it only to deceive the foolish common people.” “Are you, in your"
1953,“DELAY NOT.”,"present situation, willing to die?” “_Yes, and willing to go to hell,"
1954,“DELAY NOT.”,and stay there forever and ever!_”
1955,“DELAY NOT.”,
1956,“DELAY NOT.”,"Giving her several tracts on infidelity, which she contemptuously threw"
1957,“DELAY NOT.”,"on the floor, I invoked a Father’s blessing on her, and departed—never"
1958,“DELAY NOT.”,to meet again till we stand around the judgment-seat of Christ.
1959,“DELAY NOT.”,
1960,“DELAY NOT.”,The clouds which were wandering over the heavens when I entered the
1961,“DELAY NOT.”,"house, had collected in a mass, and produced one of the most awful"
1962,“DELAY NOT.”,storms I ever witnessed in my life. The wind blew most furiously; the
1963,“DELAY NOT.”,rain poured in torrents; peal after peal of the most deafening thunder
1964,“DELAY NOT.”,echoed and reëchoed among the mountain crags; and flash after flash
1965,“DELAY NOT.”,"of piercing lightning darted across the heavens. But, my dear young"
1966,“DELAY NOT.”,"friends, this storm did not compare, in its madness and fury, with that"
1967,“DELAY NOT.”,still more awful storm of despair and hopeless agony which was raging
1968,“DELAY NOT.”,in the breast of her from whom I had just parted.
1969,“DELAY NOT.”,
1970,“DELAY NOT.”,"Dear young friends, do not put off till to-morrow the eternal interests"
1971,“DELAY NOT.”,"of your immortal souls. Remember—oh, remember the terrible condition"
1972,“DELAY NOT.”,of the woman about whom I have been telling you.

2026,NEWTON.,
2027,NEWTON.,The night was so very cold that she drew two of her children close to

2030,NEWTON.,
2031,NEWTON.,"They thus journeyed on, drawn rapidly over the smoothly beaten road by"

2034,NEWTON.,the danger which lurked so short a distance behind them.
2035,NEWTON.,
2036,NEWTON.,Presently she heard in the far-off distance the faint howl of a wolf.

2066,NEWTON.,

2140,HORNE.,"The fields which a few months since looked so gay and beautiful, with"

2144,HORNE.,"harvest into his garner, or left it carefully stacked in the field to"
2145,HORNE.,breast the storms of the approaching Winter. The variegated blossoms of

2147,HORNE.,"garden which, a short time since, sent forth such delightful fragrance,"
2148,HORNE.,now lies barren and bare. The leaves have fallen one by one from the
2149,HORNE.,"sturdy oak, and left it in its lonely barrenness to battle with the"
2150,HORNE.,piercing winds and howling tempests of the winter king. I have sat by

2180,HORNE.,"frequently do we see it the case, that those whom we consider friends,"

2184,HORNE.,"expectations, they can nowhere be found, but have left us to struggle"
2185,HORNE.,"against difficulties, when we most needed their advice and counsel."
2186,HORNE.,"Let us not, then, put too much trust in an arm of flesh, but always"

2264,COWPER’S TASK.,
2265,COWPER’S TASK.,ABOUT fifty years after the birth of Christ there lived a Roman
2266,COWPER’S TASK.,Emperor whose name was Nero. He was one of the most cruel and
2267,COWPER’S TASK.,unmerciful men whose lives are recorded in history. He put to death
2268,COWPER’S TASK.,many of the noblest citizens of Rome upon the very slightest and most
2269,COWPER’S TASK.,unfounded charges. The most bloody and brutal act of his life was the
2270,COWPER’S TASK.,persecution of the Christians in and about the city of Rome. He set
2271,COWPER’S TASK.,fire to the city in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of seeing a
2272,COWPER’S TASK.,conflagration similar to that of a great city which had been destroyed
2273,COWPER’S TASK.,many years before. To silence the report of his having set fire to
2274,COWPER’S TASK.,"the city, the base Nero laid the guilt of it upon the new sect of"
2275,COWPER’S TASK.,"Christians, whose numbers were rapidly increasing in every part of the"
2276,COWPER’S TASK.,empire. The death of these poor harmless Christians was aggravated with
2277,COWPER’S TASK.,"sport; “for they were either covered with the skins of wild beasts,"
2278,COWPER’S TASK.,"and torn to pieces by devouring dogs, or fastened to crosses, or"
2279,COWPER’S TASK.,"wrapped up in combustible garments, that when the daylight failed they"
2280,COWPER’S TASK.,"might serve, like torches, to illuminate the darkness of the night.”"
2281,COWPER’S TASK.,
2282,COWPER’S TASK.,He not only inflicted upon them every manner of torture and suffering
2283,COWPER’S TASK.,"which his wicked and depraved mind could invent, but he also took a"
2284,COWPER’S TASK.,great delight in seeing the poor innocent creatures suffer. Sometimes
2285,COWPER’S TASK.,"he drove a chariot among the sufferers, and at others he stood among"
2286,COWPER’S TASK.,them as a spectator of scenes which would make the coldest heart melt
2287,COWPER’S TASK.,"with sympathy, and the eye of the most unfeeling shed tears of sorrow."
2288,COWPER’S TASK.,
2289,COWPER’S TASK.,Such was the character of one of the most cruel and merciless wretches
2290,COWPER’S TASK.,"that ever lived. And to what thing do you suppose, dear reader, his"
2291,COWPER’S TASK.,"cruelty may be attributed? To the great delight which he took, when"
2292,COWPER’S TASK.,"a child, in inflicting pain on the harmless and inoffensive little"
2293,COWPER’S TASK.,"insect. It was his delight to extract from it cries of sorrow, and"
2294,COWPER’S TASK.,to tread upon the worm in order that he might witness its painful
2295,COWPER’S TASK.,"writhings. As he was in childhood, so was he when he became a man."
2296,COWPER’S TASK.,As in childhood he caught the fly and pierced its body through with
2297,COWPER’S TASK.,"pointed instruments, so in manhood did he cause his fellow-man to"
2298,COWPER’S TASK.,"suffer every pain which his corrupt heart could wish, or his sinful"
2299,COWPER’S TASK.,mind invent.
2300,COWPER’S TASK.,
2301,COWPER’S TASK.,Whenever I see a little boy or a little girl catching flies and pulling
2302,COWPER’S TASK.,"their legs and wings off, or piercing their bodies, I always think"
2303,COWPER’S TASK.,"_there_ will be a _second Nero_, if that disposition is not changed by"
2304,COWPER’S TASK.,"God, or a check put upon it by some kind friend."
2305,COWPER’S TASK.,

2517,LONGFELLOW.,"little feet from the thorns which strew the pathway of childhood, lying"
2518,LONGFELLOW.,"stretched on the cold ground, a lifeless corpse. Many were the tears"

2677,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2678,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"THE celebrated Hugh Miller, when a boy, was in the habit of scaling"
2679,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"giddy precipices, either in search of some peculiar specimen of rock,"
2680,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,or some unknown species of bird.
2681,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2682,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"On one occasion he saw a raven’s nest far above the ground, snugly"
2683,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"fixed on a very high cliff, which had never been scaled by the foot of"
2684,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"man. From below it was a matter of impossibility to reach it, for it"
2685,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,was more than a hundred feet above the level of the sea. He therefore
2686,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"determined to make an attempt from above. Creeping carefully along, now"
2687,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"holding by some protruding rock, now clinging to some slender shrub, he"
2688,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,at last found himself within six or eight feet of the desired prize.
2689,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"There he stopped and hesitated. Beneath, the raging surf roamed and"
2690,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,boiled. One misstep would launch him into eternity.
2691,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2692,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"His foot was stretched out to take the first step, when he observed,"
2693,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"as the sun burst suddenly from behind a cloud, the light glisten on"
2694,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"a smooth surface of chlorite, slippery as glass. He at once saw the"
2695,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"consequences of such an attempt, retraced his steps, and was, in God’s"
2696,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"providence, spared to exert an influence for good, the extent of which"
2697,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,will never be fully known.
2698,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2699,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"Reader, have you ever attempted to perform some act which no one else"
2700,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"was able to accomplish, and been on the very brink of destruction, when"
2701,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,the Sun of Righteousness shone on your pathway and revealed to your
2702,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,darkened understanding the imminent danger of your position?
2703,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2704,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"Young man, you that are anxious to write your name high above that"
2705,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"of your fellow-man, beware how you step. The ocean of a never-ending"
2706,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"eternity is roaring beneath you. You, perhaps, do not see your danger,"
2707,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"yet it is there. If you are seeking only the riches of this world,"
2708,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"which perish with their using, and endeavoring to do what no one else"
2709,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"has done, pray that God will show you the peril of your position,"
2710,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"retrace your steps, and remember the sad end of him “who layeth up"
2711,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.” Luke 12: 21.
2712,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2713,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"The sequel to this little sketch is very, very heart-rending."
2714,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2715,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,Not long after the above occurrence a youth named Mackay made a similar
2716,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,attempt; paused even for a longer time; then trusting himself to the
2717,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"treacherous chlorite, his foot slipped, and he fell headlong over the"
2718,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,"precipice. His head striking violently against a projecting rock, his"
2719,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,brains were scattered over a space of ten or twelve square yards in
2720,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,extent.
2721,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,
2722,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,The rock doubtless yet remains—a lasting monument of the sinful folly
2723,HUGH MILLER AND THE PRECIPICE.,of man.

2766,TUPPER.,WHO is there that can stand beside the simple stone which marks the
2767,TUPPER.,"birthplace of GEORGE WASHINGTON, or enter that plain cottage in the"
2768,TUPPER.,"slashes of Hanover, or walk the halls of Monticello, and not feel"
2769,TUPPER.,arising in his bosom feelings of pleasure and delight? Such feelings
2770,TUPPER.,"are natural; and I hope, dear reader, you will ever cherish them for"
2771,TUPPER.,"the memory of such men as Washington, Jefferson, Clay, and the host"
2772,TUPPER.,of others who have done so much for our common country. If we love to
2773,TUPPER.,visit the birthplaces and homes of men who have preferred death to
2774,TUPPER.,"bondage, how much greater must be the love with which we look upon the"
2775,TUPPER.,home of him who suffered and bled and died for the liberty of the soul
2776,TUPPER.,"from the powerful bondage of sin and Satan—the home of Saul of Tarsus,"
2777,TUPPER.,the scholar of Gamaliel.
2778,TUPPER.,
2779,TUPPER.,"That Tarsus was the birthplace of Saul is not very certain, as no one"
2780,TUPPER.,"informs us of the fact; but one thing is certain, it was there he spent"
2781,TUPPER.,"the hours of his childhood, there he was taught to reverence God’s"
2782,TUPPER.,"Word, and there his tender mind received those impressions of love to"
2783,TUPPER.,"God and his fellow-man, which followed him throughout his interesting"
2784,TUPPER.,and eventful life.
2785,TUPPER.,
2786,TUPPER.,"Tarsus, at the time of Saul’s residence, was one of the largest cities"
2787,TUPPER.,"in Asia Minor. It was beautifully situated on the river Cydnus, in the"
2788,TUPPER.,"midst of a most fertile and picturesque valley, and was the capital of"
2789,TUPPER.,Cilicia. On the one side a lofty peak of the Taurus mountains lifted
2790,TUPPER.,"its hoary head, and stood like a sentinel, to watch over and protect"
2791,TUPPER.,the city which lay in such calm quietude at its base; on the other lay
2792,TUPPER.,"the lovely valley of the Cydnus, interspersed with beautiful groves"
2793,TUPPER.,"of palm trees and luxuriant gardens, through the midst of which the"
2794,TUPPER.,silver stream wound its way till it was lost in the Mediterranean sea.
2795,TUPPER.,"Over this plain, happy cottages were scattered like stars in the blue"
2796,TUPPER.,"canopy of heaven. Above the city, about a mile distant, were the falls"
2797,TUPPER.,"of the Cydnus, whose sullen roar added no little to the grandeur of"
2798,TUPPER.,the scenery. Such was the nature of the country in which the youthful
2799,TUPPER.,"Saul spent the days of his childhood and youth. Tarsus, as Saul himself"
2800,TUPPER.,"says, was “no mean city.” It was no less remarkable for the beauty of"
2801,TUPPER.,"its situation, than as a seat of learning and wide-spread commerce."
2802,TUPPER.,
2803,TUPPER.,"There is something about the word Home, which in itself is pleasant."
2804,TUPPER.,How delightful is it to him upon whose locks have fallen the snows of
2805,TUPPER.,"many winters, and whose brow has been furrowed by the hand of time,"
2806,TUPPER.,to look back to the home and friends of his childhood! Every thing
2807,TUPPER.,"about the old homestead is interesting to him. Here, surrounded by"
2808,TUPPER.,"kind friends and dear relatives, he spent the happiest hours of his"
2809,TUPPER.,life. Every spot has some attraction. In one he once was rescued from
2810,TUPPER.,danger; in another he used to indulge in those sportive games which
2811,TUPPER.,afford so much pleasure to the young beginner of life’s journey; beside
2812,TUPPER.,"some murmuring stream he often strayed, and stole the nimble trout from"
2813,TUPPER.,"its crystal home, or rested his weary limbs beneath the wide-extending"
2814,TUPPER.,branches of the aged oak which overhung the gushing spring.
2815,TUPPER.,
2816,TUPPER.,"Such, doubtless, were the feelings with which the great “Apostle of"
2817,TUPPER.,"the Gentiles,” when his mind was “burdened with the care of all the"
2818,TUPPER.,"churches,” visited his native city. And now how changed! An English"
2819,TUPPER.,writer thus describes the present condition of that once prosperous
2820,TUPPER.,"city: “It is now a Turkish town, greatly decayed, but still of some"
2821,TUPPER.,"relative importance, and carrying on a somewhat active commerce. The"
2822,TUPPER.,"population is about 6,000.”—However the works of _man_ may have"
2823,TUPPER.,"decayed in and around Tarsus, yet the works of _God_ remain almost"
2824,TUPPER.,unaltered.—“The rich harvests of corn still grow luxuriantly after the
2825,TUPPER.,rains in spring; the same tents of goats’ hair are still seen covering
2826,TUPPER.,the plain in busy harvest. The same sunset lingers on the pointed
2827,TUPPER.,summits. The same shadows gather in the deep ravines. The water-falls
2828,TUPPER.,of the Cydnus still break over the same rocks.”
2829,TUPPER.,
2830,TUPPER.,Who would not like to visit a city once hallowed by the presence of one
2831,TUPPER.,of the greatest and best of men?

2888,TUPPER.,"feelings of the deepest sorrow, and sincerely wish that I could again"
2889,TUPPER.,spend those hours which afforded me so much innocent delight. It is
2890,TUPPER.,"true, that I had a home only for a very few years, for I had scarcely"
2891,TUPPER.,"learned to love my mother and feel the worth of my father, before the"
2892,TUPPER.,clods of the valley rumbled over their coffins; yet those years were
2893,TUPPER.,the happiest of my life.
2894,TUPPER.,
2895,TUPPER.,It is in the family circle that we are taught so many lessons of
2896,TUPPER.,"kindness to our fellow-men, and it is there we are fitted to enter upon"

2898,TUPPER.,"alone, are the seeds of truth and morality sown by the affectionate"
2899,TUPPER.,hand of an attached mother; and a loving sister entwines her affections
2900,TUPPER.,"around the heart of a thoughtless brother, and frequently keeps him"

2907,TUPPER.,"It was around the fireside that such men as Patrick Henry, Henry Clay"

2910,TUPPER.,
2911,TUPPER.,"Well has it been remarked, “There is no place like home.”"
2912,TUPPER.,
2913,TUPPER.,"I had rather part with my right hand or my right eye, than to be"
2914,TUPPER.,deprived of those simple truths taught me by my sainted mother when
2915,TUPPER.,I was scarcely old enough to lisp her name. How indelibly are they
2916,TUPPER.,impressed upon my mind! And those simple prayers which she taught
2917,TUPPER.,"me—shall I ever forget them? No, never. They will go with me to my"
2918,TUPPER.,"grave. And when I was sick, how she watched over me, nursed me, and"
2919,TUPPER.,prayed for my recovery!
2920,TUPPER.,
2921,TUPPER.,My home! How thoughts of the loved and lost arise in my mind at the

2924,TUPPER.,
2925,TUPPER.,"It is customary with many heathen nations, when any one of their number"

2928,TUPPER.,last breath with no friend near to whisper words of consolation in his
2929,TUPPER.,"dying ear, or shed a tear of regret at his departure."
2930,TUPPER.,
2931,TUPPER.,How different in the Christian family! Nothing can equal the tender

2936,TUPPER.,"William Jay, in speaking of domestic happiness, uses the following"

2938,TUPPER.,"so satisfying, as the quiet joys of home? Yonder comes the laborer;—he"
2939,TUPPER.,has borne the burden and the heat of the day; the descending sun
2940,TUPPER.,"has released him from his toil, and he is hastening home to enjoy"
2941,TUPPER.,"his repose. Half way down the lane, by the side of which stands his"
2942,TUPPER.,"cottage, his children run to meet him. One he carries and one he"
2943,TUPPER.,leads. See his toil-worn countenance assume an air of cheerfulness. His
2944,TUPPER.,hardships are forgotten—fatigue vanishes—he eats and is satisfied.
2945,TUPPER.,Inhabitant of the lowly dwelling! who can be indifferent to thy
2946,TUPPER.,comfort? Peace to thy house!”
2947,TUPPER.,
2948,TUPPER.,"But, children, that pleasant home cannot always be the abode of"
2949,TUPPER.,happiness.
2950,TUPPER.,
2951,TUPPER.,"Since sin entered into this world of ours, and death by sin, man can"
2952,TUPPER.,never be perfectly happy.
2953,TUPPER.,
2954,TUPPER.,Sooner or later some member of that family will be locked in the cold
2955,TUPPER.,embrace of Death; and sadness will follow in the footsteps of joy.
2956,TUPPER.,"There will be a vacant chair, and a deserted hearth-stone, ere many"
2957,TUPPER.,more days shall have passed away. That dwelling in which pleasure and
2958,TUPPER.,"happiness now reign, shall soon echo with the sobs and lamentations of"
2959,TUPPER.,"those who have parted with perhaps a father, a mother, a fond sister,"
2960,TUPPER.,"or a loving brother. He who to-day resides in the costliest mansion,"
2961,TUPPER.,may to-morrow be an inhabitant of a hovel. That father who to-day bowed
2962,TUPPER.,"before the family altar, and asked a Heavenly Father’s blessing upon"
2963,TUPPER.,"his children, may be wrapped in the winding sheet of Death to-morrow."
2964,TUPPER.,
2965,TUPPER.,"How important then is it, that we should look forward to a home in"

3043,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"LEWISBURG, Va., July 31st, 1858."
3044,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,
3045,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,MY DEAR SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS:—I have been intending to write you a
3046,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"short letter ever since leaving home, but have been so constantly"
3047,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,engaged that I have not found an opportunity.
3048,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,
3049,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,A great deal of interest has transpired since the commencement of my
3050,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"mountain trip, of which I should like to tell you, but must defer"
3051,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"doing so until we meet, which, if God spares our lives, will be in a"
3052,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,few weeks. I know you would like very much to leave the hot and dusty
3053,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"streets of Richmond, and come out and enjoy the pure mountain air"
3054,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"and health-giving water. My own health has improved very much, and"
3055,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,I do most earnestly pray that it and my life may be precious in the
3056,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"sight of God, and I may yet ere long enjoy the greatest of earthly"
3057,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,privileges—preaching the mystery of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I
3058,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,have very often thought of and frequently remembered you at a throne
3059,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,of grace. Oh! you know not how much pleasure it would afford me to see
3060,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"you _all_ professors of religion. You know I told you before leaving,"
3061,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,if any of you should _perish_—I feel sad to think of such a thing—I
3062,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"hoped it would not be my fault, for I had endeavored, feebly and"
3063,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"imperfectly though it was, to lead your youthful feet in the ways of"
3064,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,righteousness—the paths of peace.
3065,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,
3066,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,I feel constrained to urge you once more to _come to Jesus_. We may
3067,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"never meet again on earth, and I do so sincerely desire to meet my"
3068,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"Sabbath-school class in heaven. Suppose _one_ of you should be missing,"
3069,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"which will it be? May each one of you ask himself the question, “_Lord,"
3070,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,is it I?_”
3071,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,
3072,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"And then, my dear young friends, we want ministers so badly. Where"
3073,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"shall we get them? Do I not hear at least _one_ of you say, “_Here am"
3074,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"I; Lord, send me?_” Think of that shepherdless and sorrowing flock,"
3075,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"that vacant pulpit, that newly made grave, in Amelia county! think how"
3076,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,fearlessly and faithfully the lamented S. HAMNER DAVIS stood up for
3077,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"Jesus, and how triumphantly he died! My dear scholars, will not _some_"
3078,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"of you, would it be too much to say _all_ of you, dedicate yourselves"
3079,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,to the work of the blessed ministry? I know it has not a great many
3080,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,"earthly attractions, but there is something cheering in the thought of"
3081,TO MY SABBATH-SCHOOL CLASS.,living for the benefit of your fellow-men. I had rather be the humble

3098,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,
3099,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,A YOUTH was once unintentionally thrown into the company of some half

3104,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,
3105,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,He left them and went to his room. It was time for retiring to rest.
3106,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,He opened his Bible and attempted to read its sacred pages; but he
3107,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"could not confine his thoughts. The low, vulgar anecdotes of that"
3108,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,godless party were continually flitting across his mind. Their hollow
3109,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,mockery of God still rung in his ear; the thought that perhaps there
3110,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"was no God, no heaven, no hell, disturbed his hitherto pleasant"
3111,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"evening meditations; but that kind, friendly voice within, the lives"
3112,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"and death-beds of parents whom he had loved only to lose, told him"
3113,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"too plainly there was a God above, of tender and forgiving mercy,"
3114,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"there was a heaven of bliss and joy, there was a lake whose waves of"
3115,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"fire and brimstone were never quiet. He knelt down to pray, and the"

3117,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,his thoughts; he retired to rest—they haunted his slumbers; he awoke

3123,HALF AN HOUR IN BAD COMPANY.,"be forgotten for a time, but, like the serpent concealed in a bed of"

3315,LONGFELLOW.,
3316,LONGFELLOW.,
3317,LONGFELLOW.,ALMOST two hundred years ago there lived in Scotland a girl whose
3318,LONGFELLOW.,"name was MARGARET WILSON. She was a covenanter; that is, she belonged"
3319,LONGFELLOW.,to that noble band of Scotch Christians who claimed the right of
3320,LONGFELLOW.,worshiping God according to the teachings of their own consciences.
3321,LONGFELLOW.,
3322,LONGFELLOW.,About this time a violent persecution was commenced against these
3323,LONGFELLOW.,"quiet, inoffensive and pious covenanters. The officer who commanded the"
3324,LONGFELLOW.,King’s (James II.) forces in Scotland was named CLAVERHOUSE. He was a
3325,LONGFELLOW.,"man of violent temper, and possessed a heart as hard as adamant. The"
3326,LONGFELLOW.,"mere mention of his name would cast a gloom over many a happy home,"
3327,LONGFELLOW.,and mothers would clasp their children closer to their bosoms whenever
3328,LONGFELLOW.,the news of his approach reached their ears. He drank in iniquity like
3329,LONGFELLOW.,"water, and breathed out bitter persecution and death against God’s"
3330,LONGFELLOW.,servants. The poor covenanters were driven from their peaceful homes
3331,LONGFELLOW.,"by his troopers, and forced to seek shelter in the rugged sides of the"
3332,LONGFELLOW.,mountains. There they were hunted and shot down like wild beasts of the
3333,LONGFELLOW.,"forest. Homeless, poor, despised, forsaken of man, day after day, and"
3334,LONGFELLOW.,"night after night, they wandered through the pathless woods without"
3335,LONGFELLOW.,"clothing to protect or food to nourish them. From many a mountain top,"
3336,LONGFELLOW.,"from many a barren heath, in the silence of the night, the fervent"
3337,LONGFELLOW.,prayer and the wild warbling notes of some simple Scotch hymn went up
3338,LONGFELLOW.,"like incense before the face of Jehovah. It is true “they were stoned,"
3339,LONGFELLOW.,"they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword;"
3340,LONGFELLOW.,"they wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins; being destitute,"
3341,LONGFELLOW.,"afflicted, tormented; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in"
3342,LONGFELLOW.,"dens and caves of the earth.” (Acts xi. 37, 38.) They were imprisoned"
3343,LONGFELLOW.,"by hundreds, and hung by scores. Corpses were seen dangling from trees,"
3344,LONGFELLOW.,and the atmosphere itself was tainted with death. The blood-thirsty
3345,LONGFELLOW.,troopers spared neither age nor sex. The prattling babe and the hoary
3346,LONGFELLOW.,head were alike disregarded.
3347,LONGFELLOW.,
3348,LONGFELLOW.,The severity of the persecution only made them cling more closely to
3349,LONGFELLOW.,"their religion, and a mighty army of martyrs went up from Scotland to"
3350,LONGFELLOW.,join the ranks of the great captain of their salvation—Jesus Christ.
3351,LONGFELLOW.,
3352,LONGFELLOW.,The noble courage with which MARGARET WILSON suffered death rather
3353,LONGFELLOW.,"than forsake the religion of her childhood, has made her name to be"
3354,LONGFELLOW.,"held in lasting remembrance. She was quite young, but showed a degree"
3355,LONGFELLOW.,of calm composure and unshaken faith worthy of much riper years. On
3356,LONGFELLOW.,"being seized by the troopers, she was told that her life would be"
3357,LONGFELLOW.,spared if she would give up her religion. This she positively refused
3358,LONGFELLOW.,"to do, and was sentenced to be drowned. She was alike unmoved by the"
3359,LONGFELLOW.,fierce countenances of the brutal soldiery and their horrible threats.
3360,LONGFELLOW.,Her heart was fixed. She was as firm as a rock. Finding her still
3361,LONGFELLOW.,"unyielding, she was taken to a place where the Solway overflows twice"
3362,LONGFELLOW.,"a day, and securely fastened to a stake fixed in the sand between high"
3363,LONGFELLOW.,and low water mark. Presently the tide commenced coming in. At first
3364,LONGFELLOW.,it played around her feet; by and by it rose higher and higher; at
3365,LONGFELLOW.,last the waves approached within a few inches of her lips. Still she
3366,LONGFELLOW.,remained unmoved. Her unclouded brow looked serene and happy. Her cheek
3367,LONGFELLOW.,"was pale, but not with fear. Her thoughts were wandering by the banks"
3368,LONGFELLOW.,of the river of the Water of Life; she seemed to be listening to the
3369,LONGFELLOW.,angelic notes of the heavenly choir.
3370,LONGFELLOW.,

3424,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3425,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3426,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"THERE lives in the city of Richmond, Virginia, a very venerable and"
3427,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"highly respected negro blacksmith, named Gilbert Hunt. For more"
3428,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,than three-score years he has pursued his humble calling; and even
3429,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"now, at the advanced age of seventy-seven years, the merry ring of"
3430,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,Gilbert’s anvil is among the first things that break the stillness of
3431,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,the morning. His shop is situated on one of the most busy streets in
3432,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"the city; and long before the stores are opened, or the busy hum of"
3433,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"human voices heard, the lively glow of the blacksmith’s fire and the"
3434,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"unceasing blowing of his bellows, whisper in the ear of many a tardy"
3435,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,young man—_Be diligent in business_.
3436,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3437,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,Thus has he lived and labored through the weary days of many a long
3438,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"year. Though time has plowed many a deep furrow across his dusky brow,"
3439,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"though his head is covered with the almond-tree blossoms of age,"
3440,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"though those that look out of the windows are darkened, though the"
3441,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"doors are shut in the streets, though the silver cord has been worn"
3442,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"almost to its last thread, yet Gilbert Hunt remains still healthy and"
3443,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"robust, retains the cheerfulness of youth, and seems to feel that his"
3444,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,work on earth is far from being accomplished.
3445,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3446,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"His dark countenance, while in conversation, is lighted up with a"
3447,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"happy smile, and you cannot help feeling, as you look upon the old"
3448,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"and grey-headed man, what a precious promise that beautiful old hymn"
3449,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"expresses when it says,"
3450,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3451,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"“E’en down to old age, all my people shall prove"
3452,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;"
3453,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"_And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,"
3454,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"Like lambs, they shall still in my bosom be borne_.”"
3455,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3456,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"The eventful life of this aged blacksmith, together with his vivid"
3457,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"remembrance of bygone days, renders an hour spent in his company very"
3458,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,pleasant.
3459,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3460,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"’Tis true, his name is unknown both to fortune and to fame; for but few"
3461,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"stop, in this cold world of ours, to pay the deserved meed of praise to"
3462,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"humble, unpretending merit."
3463,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3464,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"“Far from the madd’ning crowd’s ignoble strife,"
3465,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,His sober wishes never learned to stray—
3466,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,Along the cool sequestered vale of life
3467,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,He kept the noiseless tenor of his way.”
3468,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3469,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,But to return to our first intention. Gilbert Hunt was born in the
3470,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"county of King William, (Va.,) about the year 1780; came to the city"
3471,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,of Richmond when seventeen years of age; learned the trade of a
3472,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"carriage-maker, at which he worked for a considerable length of time,"
3473,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,and by constant industry and close economy laid by a sufficient amount
3474,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"of money to purchase his freedom of his master. In 1832, he determined"
3475,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"to emigrate to Liberia; and in February of that year, left Virginia."
3476,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"He remained in Africa eight months, and having travelled some five"
3477,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"hundred miles into the interior, returned to the coast and embarked for"
3478,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"home. His reception, on arriving at Richmond, was one which would have"
3479,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"done honor to any conqueror or statesman, so highly was he respected"
3480,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"by the citizens. “When I reached Richmond,” to use his own language,"
3481,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,“the wharves were crowded with all classes and conditions of people;
3482,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"I was invited to ride up town in a very fine carriage, but preferred"
3483,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"a plainer style, and came up in a Jersey wagon, seated on my trunk.”"
3484,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"Since that time, nothing of special interest has transpired in the"
3485,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"life of this truly remarkable man. “Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,” he"
3486,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,has followed with unpretending simplicity of character his accustomed
3487,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"labor. Success seems not to make him proud, nor failure to discourage"
3488,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,him. He has made a sufficient amount of money to enable him to spend
3489,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"the evening of his life in quiet retirement, but his place at his shop"
3490,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"is seldom, if ever, vacant."
3491,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3492,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,For more than half a century he has been a consistent member of the
3493,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"Baptist Church; thus teaching us, would we have the needed blessings"
3494,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"of life added to us, we should seek first the kingdom of God and His"
3495,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,righteousness.
3496,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3497,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,The event which invests the name of Gilbert Hunt with more than
3498,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"ordinary interest, is the active part which he took at the burning of"
3499,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,the Richmond theatre in 1811.
3500,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3501,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"We add a brief account of this sad occurrence, as related by Gilbert"
3502,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"himself, feeling there are but few eyes which can read it without"
3503,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,moistening with tears.
3504,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3505,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"“It was the night of Christmas, 1811. I had just returned from worship"
3506,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"at the Baptist church, and was about sitting down to my supper, when"
3507,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,I was startled by the cry that the Theatre was on fire. My wife’s
3508,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"mistress called me, and begged me to hasten to the Theatre, and, if"
3509,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"possible, save her only daughter,—a young lady who had been teaching"
3510,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"me my book every night, and one whom I loved very much. The wind was"
3511,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"quite high, and the hissing and crackling flames soon wrapt the entire"
3512,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"building in their embrace. The house was built of wood, and therefore"
3513,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,the work of destruction was very short. When I reached the building
3514,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"I immediately went to the house of a colored fiddler, named Gilliat,"
3515,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"who lived near by, and begged him to lend me a bed on which the poor"
3516,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,frightened creatures might fall as they leaped from the windows. This
3517,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,he positively refused to do. I then procured a step-ladder and placed
3518,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,it against the wall of the burning building. The door was too small
3519,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"to permit the crowd, pushed forward by the scorching flames, to get"
3520,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"out, and numbers of them were madly leaping from the windows only to"
3521,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,be crushed to death by the fall. I looked up and saw Dr. —— standing
3522,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"at one of the top windows, and calling to me to catch the ladies as he"
3523,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"handed them down. I was then young and strong, and the poor screaming"
3524,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,ladies felt as light as feathers. By this means we got all the ladies
3525,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,out of this portion of the house. The flames were rapidly approaching
3526,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"the Doctor. They were beginning to take hold of his clothing, and, O"
3527,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"me! I thought that good man who had saved so many precious lives, was"
3528,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"going to be burned up. He jumped from the window, and when he touched"
3529,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,the ground I thought he was dead. He could not move an inch. No one
3530,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"was near that part of the house, for the wall was tottering like a"
3531,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"drunken man, and I looked to see it every minute crush the Doctor to"
3532,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"death. I heard him scream out, ‘_Will nobody save me?_’ and at the risk"
3533,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"of my own life, rushed to him and bore him away to a place of safety."
3534,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,The scene surpassed any thing I ever saw. The wild shriek of hopeless
3535,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"agony, the piercing cry, ‘Lord, save, or I perish,’ the uplifted hands,"
3536,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"the earnest prayer for mercy, for pardon, for salvation. I think I see"
3537,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,it now—all—all just as it happened.” And the old negro stopped to
3538,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,wipe away a tear which was trickling down his wrinkled cheek.
3539,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3540,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,“The next day I went to the place where I had seen so much suffering.
3541,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"There lay a heap of half-burnt bodies—young and old, rich and poor,"
3542,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,the governor and the little child—whose hearts were still fluttering
3543,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"like leaves. I never found my young mistress, and suppose she perished"
3544,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,with the many others who were present on that mournful occasion. _I
3545,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,thought there would never be any more theatres after that._” The old
3546,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,man was silent; his tale was told; tear-drops were standing in his eyes.
3547,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,
3548,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,Should any of my readers desire to learn more of the history of this
3549,LONGFELLOW’S VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.,"venerable old negro, the simple sign of"

3646,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"IT has long been a mystery to us that the Bible is so little read,"
3647,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"so poorly appreciated. A few hurried snatches in the morning, the"
3648,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"shortest psalm in the evening, to a very great extent constitute the"
3649,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,Bible reading of many who even profess and call themselves Christians.
3650,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,The prolific press is daily pouring forth issues of aids to Scripture
3651,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"reading; the most gifted intellects, both of this and other lands,"
3652,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,are using all their powers to make the Bible the text-book of the
3653,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"age; but in vain. There seems to have arisen, in the minds of many,"
3654,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"an insatiable desire for something new, something stirring, something"
3655,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,calculated to arouse their stupified faculties.
3656,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3657,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"Persons will pore, hour after hour, over the pages of some trashy"
3658,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"novel, while the Bible—_its_ pages glittering with golden truths—its"
3659,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"chapters glowing with a Saviour’s love—lies unopened for weeks, yea,"
3660,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,months; its clasps blackened by canker—its cover thick with dust.
3661,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3662,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,They will nestle in their bosoms the sin-stained pages of Byron—not
3663,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"knowing his slime is polluting, his poison infecting, the purest"

3670,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,You cannot inflict greater punishment on some persons than force them
3671,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,daily to read a portion of God’s word. To them it is as a root out of
3672,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"dry ground, having no form or comeliness. Notwithstanding this, we"

3675,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"work, ancient or modern, which is marked by such variety of style—such"
3676,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,beauty of diction—such sublimity of sentiment. Its writers are taken
3677,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,from all classes and conditions of life—from the shepherd boy that
3678,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"watches his father’s flocks on the grassy hill-sides of Judea, to the"
3679,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"king, the golden magnificence of whose court, and unerring wisdom,"
3680,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,attracted the notice of Arabia’s queen—from the humble fisherman who

3733,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,Look at that stranger standing on Mars Hill. ’Tis true he is not
3734,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,commanding in person; neither is his speech in itself eloquent; but
3735,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,there is an electric current which continually passes from his soul to

3738,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"With the deep blue sky as his canopy, and standing where Socrates once"

3750,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3751,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,But there is another feature in this precious Book to which we would
3752,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,briefly direct your attention.
3753,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3754,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"THE CHARACTERS.—A young man, dressed in the plain garb of a"
3755,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"husbandman, is wandering over the rugged sides of mount Ephraim in"
3756,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,search of his father’s cattle. Exposure to wind and storm has rendered
3757,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"his frame robust, his tread firm and steady. Fearless courage sits"
3758,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"enthroned on his peerless brow; stubborn resolution, untiring energy,"
3759,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"prompt decision, all beam from a countenance, which, though bronzed by"
3760,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"the ardent frown of the summer’s sun, yet is none the less attractive"
3761,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,for the noble qualities which it so plainly displays. But it is the
3762,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"commanding appearance of his person, the symmetry of his form, which"
3763,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,first unconsciously draws the attention. As the oak of the forest lifts
3764,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"its head far above the surrounding trees, so does the dauntless crest"
3765,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,of this choice young man rise head and shoulders above his companions.
3766,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3767,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,Such is the person and character of him who was chosen as the first
3768,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"king of Israel; and as Pallas, “over the head and shoulders broad” of"
3769,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"Ulysses,"
3770,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3771,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"“Diffused grace celestial, his whole form"
3772,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"Dilated, and to statelier height advanced,"

3774,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"To the Phæacians,”"
3775,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3776,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"so God endowed the son of Kish, in order that he might better"
3777,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,command the respect of those over whom he was called to preside.
3778,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3779,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,Time does not suffice to notice in detail his anointing by the
3780,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"venerable Samuel, nor the swelling tide of human beings which rolled"
3781,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"along the streets of Mizpah, on the day of his proclamation, nor how"
3782,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"the enemies of Israel were swept before his stalwart arm, like chaff"
3783,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,before the whirlwind.
3784,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3785,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,Thus far Saul presents one of the noblest specimens of filial
3786,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"obedience, of daring bravery, of unreserved submission to the will of"
3787,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"God, to be found in sacred history."
3788,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3789,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"But his heart becomes elated at his unparalleled success, and the"
3790,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"remainder of his life is a series of heaven-daring presumption,"
3791,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"of flagrant disobedience, of detestable faithlessness, of unmanly"
3792,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,cowardice; his bosom swells with arrogant pride—that invariable
3793,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,precursor of destruction—which paves his way to the most ignominious
3794,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,of deaths—that of a cowardly suicide.
3795,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3796,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,“Then wish not o’er his earthly tomb
3797,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,The baneful night-shades’ lurid bloom

3799,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,"Nor oh! forbid the twisted thorn,"

3801,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,With spring’s green swelling buds to vegetate anew.”
3802,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,
3803,THE LAMP AND THE LANTERN.,But only remember that _one_ act of indiscretion will blast a lifetime

4360,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,peace with God; the last time I shall ever listen to the glad tidings
4361,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,of salvation; the last time I shall hear from the sacred desk the
4362,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"earnest entreaty, Come to Jesus; the last time I shall ever sing the"
4363,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,songs of Zion!”
4364,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,
4365,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,Such were the thoughts which rushed wildly through the mind of a young
4366,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,man as his unwilling feet lingered on the steps of the house of God. He
4367,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,was leaving that house with a heart at enmity with his heavenly Father.
4368,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,Again and again had he put off for a convenient season the eternal
4369,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"interests of his never-dying soul. Long, long had Satan pacified his"
4370,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,restless conscience by whispering in his ear that to-morrow would be
4371,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"time enough. To-morrow after to-morrow had come and gone, yet he was"
4372,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,farther from salvation than he had ever been.
4373,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,
4374,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"The minister’s earnest entreaty, a conviction of the awful eternity"
4375,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"which awaited him if he died in his sins, pressed with burning weight"
4376,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,upon his thoughts. He seemed to be held fast by some resistless power.
4377,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,“Perhaps it may be the last night of the season of salvation; God only
4378,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"knows. I will arise and go to my Father,” thought he to himself. He"
4379,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"sought the minister; went with him to his study; and there, by the aid"
4380,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"of God’s Spirit, trusts he gave himself to his Saviour."
4381,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,
4382,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"Fellow sinner, this may be the last night of the season of salvation"
4383,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"to you. Will you not come to Jesus? Father and mother, brother and"
4384,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"sister, those that love you tenderly, all join in the entreaty, _Come"
4385,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,to Jesus_. He is a precious Saviour; he is a willing Saviour; he is an
4386,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,able Saviour. Then will you not come and cast your burden of sin upon
4387,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"him? He has never turned away one soul. “Ho, every one that thirsteth,"
4388,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat;"
4389,THE LAST SERMON OF THE SEASON.,"yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.”"

4425,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,THERE is something to me peculiarly pleasant in a country Sabbath. No
4426,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"rattle of carts, no bustle of crowds, no hum of voices, disturb the"
4427,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,calm and holy quietude of the hallowed day. Cattle are quietly grazing
4428,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"on grassy meadows, or sleeping in the refreshing shade; the irregular"
4429,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,tinkle of the sheep-bell falls sweetly on the ear; the plough stands
4430,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,motionless in the unfinished furrow; the little songster trills from
4431,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,some swinging bough its morning song. The household dog seems to know
4432,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,it is a day of peaceful rest. His voice is hushed in silence. The
4433,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,clouds glide calmly across the heavens; the rays of the Sabbath sun
4434,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"rest sweetly on the face of nature. A dreamy, delightful serenity"
4435,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,hovers over all the land. The incense of prayer rises from many a
4436,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"family altar, and the accents of praise tremble on many a lip."
4437,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4438,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,Let us go up to the house of God. How different from our city churches!
4439,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,Perhaps it is some venerable building whose foundation was laid by men
4440,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"to whom the faces and forms of a Samuel Davies, or William Wilson, were"
4441,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,familiar; perhaps remains of the foundation erected for the protection
4442,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,of God’s people against savage cruelty still linger around it; perhaps
4443,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,marks of the Indian’s bullet have not yet been effaced from its rude
4444,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,stone walls. Let us cross its threshold. No stained glass softens the
4445,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"rays of light, no cushioned pew invites you to a seat, no costly pulpit"
4446,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,meets your eye; no beautiful fresco will draw your attention from the
4447,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"minister or the word of God. Every thing is as plain, as practical, as"
4448,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"solid, as the men who first worshipped beneath its roof, but who now"
4449,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,sleep beneath the waving grass of the adjoining cemetery.
4450,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4451,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,One by one the congregation begin to enter and take their seats. They
4452,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,reverently bow their heads and seek the aid of God’s Spirit to enable
4453,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,them rightly to understand and apply the truths to which they shall
4454,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,listen. Many and varied are the personages which draw the attention.
4455,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,One is a venerable elder: time has not dealt gently with him; his brow
4456,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"is furrowed, his cheek wrinkled, and he totters feebly to his seat"
4457,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"beneath the weight of many years, and a life of laborious toil. Though"
4458,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"the fires of life are well nigh gone out, hope burns brightly in his"
4459,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"heart, and beams forth from his eye. The assurance that his Redeemer"
4460,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"liveth, is the rod and staff on which he leans for support. Another is"
4461,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"a young man. His step is firm, his frame robust. He has not seen the"
4462,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"snows of more than twenty winters. His countenance wears a thoughtful,"
4463,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"solemn air. He is thinking of God, of heaven, of eternity. He has not"
4464,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"come to the house of God because it is his custom, to see a friend,"
4465,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,or to while away an hour. His is a nobler object. It is to worship
4466,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"God, to obtain instruction which shall lead his steps in the ways of"
4467,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"righteousness, the paths of peace. At his side sits his mother—“he is"
4468,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"the only son of his mother, and she a widow.”"
4469,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4470,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"But another form, of dignified, yet gentle, demeanor, enters the door."
4471,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"The placid features of his face, the mildness of his eye, point him"
4472,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,out as “the man of God.” His appearance is such as at once to attract
4473,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"the attention. He is very tall, perhaps above six feet. His person is"
4474,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"quite spare. He is slightly bowed with age, and as he feebly walks"
4475,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"down the aisle, you almost involuntarily rise from your seat as if to"
4476,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,do him reverence. He has long been a laborer in his Master’s vineyard.
4477,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,For more than half a century has he proclaimed the glad tidings of
4478,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,salvation from the same pulpit which he now occupies. His mind easily
4479,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,reverts to the time when the whistle of the red man’s bullet was liable
4480,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,at any moment to disturb the worship of God’s people; when the hardy
4481,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,pioneers of Christ and His kingdom came up to the house of God with
4482,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,muskets lashed to their backs. The thriving village in which he now
4483,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"resides was then almost a wilderness; cattle grazed, and corn grew in"
4484,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,the fertile valleys from which now rises the populous city. The wild
4485,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"Alleghanies, then the home of the beasts of the forest, now daily echo"
4486,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,with the rattle of the stage coach; and the shrill whistle of the
4487,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,locomotive has made the panther and the bear to seek shelter in the
4488,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,more distant West. He is one of a very few of the links which bind
4489,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,the Virginia of the present with the Virginia of fifty years ago. His
4490,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,few remaining silver locks are combed back from a forehead of fine
4491,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,proportions. He enters the sacred desk; bows his head and supplicates
4492,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"the assistance of God’s Spirit. He rises; “Let us worship God,” falls"
4493,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"tremblingly from his lips, and the whole congregation rise to their"
4494,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"feet. With earnestness, with simplicity, he invokes the presence of Him"
4495,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,with whom is the residue of the Spirit. He then slowly turns to that
4496,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"beautiful old hymn, so dear to God’s people—"
4497,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4498,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,“Whilst Thee I seek protecting power!
4499,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,Be my vain wishes stilled;
4500,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,And may this consecrated hour
4501,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,With better hopes be filled.”
4502,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4503,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,So distinct is his enunciation that his voice falters on every
4504,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"syllable. Every heart trembles in unison with his, and many an eye is"
4505,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,dimmed with the unbidden tear. From almost the entire congregation
4506,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,rises up a united song of praise. One voice after another catches it
4507,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"up, till there is scarcely one which does not join in the melodious"
4508,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,hymn.
4509,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4510,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"“They chant their artless notes in simple strain,"
4511,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim;"
4512,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"Perhaps Dundee’s wild, warbling measures rise,"
4513,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"Or plaintive martyr’s, worthy of the name;"
4514,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,Or noble Elgin beats the heavenward flame;
4515,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,The sweetest far of Scotia’s holy lays:
4516,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"Compared with these, Italian trills are tame;"
4517,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"The tickled ears no heartfelt raptures raise,"
4518,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,No unison have they with our Creator’s praise.”
4519,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4520,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"“_This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ"
4521,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief_,” is"
4522,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,announced as his text.
4523,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4524,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,Such a sermon I never heard before; such an one I am afraid I shall
4525,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"never hear again. His voice, at first weak and tremulous, strengthens"
4526,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,as he progresses with his subject. His eye burns with a new lustre; his
4527,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"frame becomes more erect, his features kindle with animation, as with"
4528,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,pathetic eloquence he dwells on Christ’s mission to this sin-stained
4529,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"world of ours. And then, his invitation to those who know Him not."
4530,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"How simple, how sublime, how earnest! His whole heart is full of the"
4531,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,deepest emotion struggling for utterance. As he looks anxiously on the
4532,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"waiting congregation, and in accents of melting tenderness, says, _of"
4533,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"whom I am chief!_ the hot blood rushes unbidden to my face, and the"
4534,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,briny tear trickles unconsciously down my cheek.
4535,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,
4536,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"I shall never forget that Sabbath, that sermon, that minister. They"
4537,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,will go with me to my grave. When I am earnestly engaged in other
4538,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,"pursuits, ever and anon visions of them flit across my mind, and awaken"
4539,A SABBATH IN THE COUNTRY.,emotions of the most delightful nature.

4555,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"She was the child of Christian parents, who had faithfully endeavored"

4557,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,early age she was deprived by death of her sainted mother; and before
4558,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"many years had elapsed, she was called to mourn the loss of a father"
4559,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,upon whom every affection of her young heart was centred. To the
4560,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,_bitterness_ of orphanage was added the loss of the greatest blessing
4561,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"on earth—health. The rose of Death was long blooming on her cheek, ere"
4562,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,her nearest friends were aware that she was falling a victim to the
4563,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,flattering and insidious attacks of consumption.
4564,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,
4565,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"She had not neglected the early instructions of her pious parents, and,"
4566,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"when very young, made a profession of her faith in Christ. For several"
4567,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"years previous to her last sickness, her mind, at times, was clouded"
4568,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"with doubts, and she occasionally seemed to suffer unutterable anguish"
4569,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,at the absence of God’s Spirit from the heart. A few days preceding
4570,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"her death, these doubts and fears were all entirely removed, and she"
4571,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"seemed to enjoy, to the fullest extent, the light of God’s reconciled"
4572,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"countenance. It was indeed beautiful to see her, who, but a few weeks"
4573,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"before, was so cold and indifferent, now wholly absorbed in the great"
4574,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,and glorious truth of salvation through Christ. She was frequently
4575,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"engaged in earnest secret prayer, and never allowed anything to be read"
4576,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"in her presence but the Bible, or some of those sweet and touching"
4577,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,hymns so soothing to the troubled heart of the dying Christian. No
4578,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"moment was to be lost. During the silent watches of the night, she"
4579,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"would frequently call her brother to her bedside, and say, “T——, read"
4580,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,to your dying sister some of those beautiful passages in Revelation
4581,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"which our dear father used to love so tenderly, and caused to be read"
4582,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,when dying.” “How beautiful! how grand! how sublime!” she would

4588,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,and tell me if there is not something in religion they knew nothing

4598,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"With calm and sweet composure, she replied, “Yes, Mr. M——, perfectly,"

4602,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"After reading the beautiful 14th chapter of St. John, Mr. M——"

4605,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,be the last time we shall ever meet again on earth: I wish you to
4606,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,preach my funeral sermon in the old R——n church—the church of my
4607,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"father and my mother, where first I listened to the glad tidings of"
4608,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"salvation; preach it from the text, “In the way of righteousness is"
4609,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death”—Prov. xii., 28."
4610,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,Preach to the living—to the living—to the living! And I want the

4629,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"she, with a sweetness and heavenly melody which beggars description,"
4630,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"joined with them and sung the entire verse _alone_,—as the voices of"
4631,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,all in the room were so much choked with emotion they could not utter
4632,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"a word. Oh, what a scene! That feeble, faltering voice spending its"

4634,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"I was standing in the very vestibule of heaven, catching some of those"

4638,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,When her brothers and sister stood around her bed to receive the dying

4647,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"A few moments before her death, a new and unusual lustre shone forth"
4648,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"from her eyes, a beautiful glow mantled her hitherto pale and wan"
4649,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"check, and in accents of the most touching and rapt eloquence, her"
4650,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"voice rich and full, she gave utterance to the following sublime"
4651,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"sentiment, which should live forever, and be proclaimed wherever the"
4652,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,Gospel of Christ is preached:—“I have tasted of Racine; I have dipped
4653,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,into Voltaire; I have read Tom Paine; I have had the daring audacity
4654,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,to study Hume; I have attempted to form a Philosophy myself—but have
4655,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"found them all”—not one exception—“FALLACY, FALLACY!”"
4656,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,
4657,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"With these words lingering on her lips, she calmly and resignedly fell"

4659,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,
4660,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,The devoted Mr. M—— complied with her minutest requests; and when
4661,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,he informed the congregation that he preached to them from the text
4662,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"selected by his departed sister in Christ, and that she urgently"
4663,THE YOUNG CHRISTIAN’S DEATH-CHAMBER.,"requested him to preach to the _living_, there was not a dry eye in the"

4714,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"DURING a great outpouring of God’s Spirit at —— college, my attention"

4716,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"character. It is true, he was the son of a godly father and a praying"
4717,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"mother; but this, rather than softening, seemed to harden his heart."
4718,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,It was one of the most copious outpourings of God’s Spirit I ever
4719,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"witnessed. The windows of heaven were indeed opened, and God was"
4720,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,pouring out such a blessing that it seemed there could not be room to
4721,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,contain it. The dry bones of the valley had been breathed upon by His
4722,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"Spirit, and hearts once dead in trespasses and sins were awakened to a"
4723,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"new life, and rejoicing in the blessed hope of salvation through Jesus"
4724,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,Christ.
4725,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,
4726,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,Nearly every student seemed to feel the need of a Saviour. Every
4727,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,countenance was marked with concern; every heart lifted to God in
4728,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,prayer for mercy and forgiveness. Rooms which once resounded with
4729,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"drunken revellings, were now Bethels of the living God. Lips which"
4730,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"once profaned Jehovah’s name, and joined in singing lewd and vulgar"
4731,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"songs, now trembled with the accents of prayer, and sung the songs of"
4732,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,Zion. It was a delightful season—I shall never forget it.
4733,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,
4734,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"Amid such scenes as these, there was one whose hard heart was steeled"
4735,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"against the influence of God’s awakening Spirit. It was A. M——, the"
4736,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,son of pious parents. Many and fervent were the prayers which ascended
4737,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"in his behalf, but they seemingly were of no avail. The more Christians"
4738,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"prayed for him, the more hardened he became. The campus, time and"
4739,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"again, resounded with his awful profanity; and even the most obdurate"
4740,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"would stop and wonder that man, “whose breath was in his nostrils,”"
4741,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,could call upon God so frequently and earnestly to _damn_ rather than

4743,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,
4744,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"Such was the extent to which his God-defying; wickedness went, that"

4746,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"of a prayer-meeting, he gathered together a few of his sinful"
4747,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,comrades and held a _mock prayer-meeting_ in an adjoining room. Is
4748,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,it not wonderful that God did not cut him down in the midst of such
4749,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"heaven-daring presumption? But, like Paul, he was a chosen vessel. God"
4750,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,had yet a great and glorious work for him to perform.
4751,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,
4752,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"During one of those meetings which he was in the habit of holding, the"
4753,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"arrow of conviction pierced his flinty heart, and laid him low and"
4754,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,bleeding at the foot of the cross.
4755,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,
4756,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"Great was the joy among the students, when the glad tidings flew from"
4757,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,lip to lip that A. M—— had come to Jesus and fallen at His feet. Old

4763,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,exultation flowed in quick succession down her furrowed cheek. Said she
4764,“PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.”,"to a friend, “_I have never bowed my knee without beseeching God to"

4799,"INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND.",The style of the building is Doric; the entrance being a large portico
4800,"INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND.",supported by six massive pillars. On each side of the portico are two
4801,"INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND.","attractive wings, used for the reception of visitors and recitation"

4805,"INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND.",The building is situated in the midst of quite a number of stalwart

4819,THE BLIND.,THE BLIND.
4820,THE BLIND.,
4821,THE BLIND.,The scene is one which awakens mingled feelings of pleasure and pain;
4822,THE BLIND.,"of pleasure to see so many afflicted little ones, for most of them are"
4823,THE BLIND.,"young, led by the hand of kindness in the pleasant and peaceful ways of"
4824,THE BLIND.,"wisdom; of pain, when you behold them rolling wildly their sightless"
4825,THE BLIND.,"orbs, and seemingly endeavoring to gather in some few straggling rays"
4826,THE BLIND.,"of the cheerful sun, or to look out upon the beautifully draped fields"
4827,THE BLIND.,"of nature, and know that all these things, so attractive to us, are"
4828,THE BLIND.,midnight darkness to them.
4829,THE BLIND.,
4830,THE BLIND.,"One of the scholars, a little girl about ten years old, read several"
4831,THE BLIND.,"passages from various books for me, and then pointed out on a large"
4832,THE BLIND.,"map of the United States, Pittsburg, and told me at the junction of"
4833,THE BLIND.,"what rivers it was situated, Richmond, Staunton, and many other places,"
4834,THE BLIND.,"with an ease and accuracy really astonishing. Two other girls, somewhat"
4835,THE BLIND.,"older, sung, and played on the piano “Do they miss me at home?” As"
4836,THE BLIND.,"I listened to the sweet melody of their well-tuned voices, I, for a"
4837,THE BLIND.,"moment, forgot their blindness, and felt tears dimming my eyes as my"
4838,THE BLIND.,"mind wandered back to the two near and dear ones at home, and I thought"
4839,THE BLIND.,"to myself, “Do they miss ME at home?” I then listened to the reading of"
4840,THE BLIND.,several passages in French by a young lady of about sixteen. It really
4841,THE BLIND.,was surprising to witness the fluency with which her delicate fingers
4842,THE BLIND.,"glided over word after word, and sentence after sentence."
4843,THE BLIND.,
4844,THE BLIND.,In all these cases the reading is done by passing the fingers over
4845,THE BLIND.,raised letters.
4846,THE BLIND.,
4847,THE BLIND.,"The sweetness of expression, the amiability of character, the flow of"
4848,THE BLIND.,"spirits which characterized one of the little pupils, Bettie Archibald,"
4849,THE BLIND.,"engaged my attention, and enlisted my affection. On being asked if she"
4850,THE BLIND.,"would be blind in heaven, she very sweetly and quickly replied, “No,"
4851,THE BLIND.,sir.”
4852,THE BLIND.,
4853,THE BLIND.,Quite a number of the male pupils are daily instructed in instrumental
4854,THE BLIND.,"music, and many of them display more than ordinary talents. It was"
4855,THE BLIND.,quite a treat to hear the little fellows play “Yankee Doodle:” their
4856,THE BLIND.,"faces were soon lighted up with smiles, and they played with as much"
4857,THE BLIND.,"life and animation, as if they were leading an American army on to"
4858,THE BLIND.,victory.

4862,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,THE DEAF AND DUMB.
4863,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,
4864,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"A large class, consisting of boys and girls, is seated in regular"
4865,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"order opposite their instructor, who is also deaf and dumb. At a given"
4866,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"signal, they all devoutly rise, and with eyes fixed on the fingers"
4867,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"of their teacher, follow him in his devotions, as he leads them to a"
4868,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,throne of grace. It is the most touching scene I ever witnessed. There
4869,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"is but one person (he, your correspondent,) in that large assembly can"
4870,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"utter a syllable, or distinguish a sound. Not a sound is heard; the"
4871,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,stillness becomes painful—deathlike; the devotion seems to grow warmer
4872,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,and warmer; the prayer is concluded; the seats resumed; all of this
4873,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,gone through without the utterance of _one_ word.
4874,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,
4875,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,What a lesson should it teach us! How true is it that we shall not
4876,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"be heard for our much speaking! Leaving the chapel, we enter the"
4877,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"recitation room. Each pupil is standing opposite a black-board, with"
4878,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,his eyes turned to the teacher; questions and answers are written
4879,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"by the instructor, and then copied by the pupils. In this room are"
4880,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"assembled classes, each under the charge of a separate teacher,"
4881,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"studying geography, grammar, history; and in one room is a small class"
4882,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,just beginning to read. The chirography of some of the pupils is really
4883,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,beautiful; and we leave the room feeling that though God has deprived
4884,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"them of two senses, yet, in his loving kindness, he has bestowed upon"
4885,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,them unusual capacities in the others. It may be a fact worthy of
4886,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"mentioning, that the deaf and dumb do the printing (raised letters) for"
4887,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,the Blind: such is the economy of the Institute.
4888,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,
4889,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,The number of pupils in the departments is at present sixty-nine.
4890,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,
4891,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"In conclusion, I would express my especial thanks and obligations to"
4892,THE DEAF AND DUMB.,"Assistant-principal Mr. COVELL, Mrs. COLEMAN, of the Blind, and Mr."

4908,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4909,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"THE sun was hanging low in the west, when we stood at the gateway"

4911,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"lustre the hoary summits of the Blue Ridge, as they printed their bold"
4912,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,outlines on the cloudless evening sky; and as a few beams fell here
4913,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"and there on the graveled walks, the flower-crowned terraces, and"
4914,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,verdant shrubbery of the beautiful greensward which stretches forth in
4915,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"front of the Asylum, we could but thank an ever-gracious and ever-good"
4916,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Providence, for His inestimable gift to mankind—the bright, sparkling,"

4919,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,A moment’s glance at the general appearance of the buildings convinces
4920,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,the beholder that they are not as beautiful nor as commanding as
4921,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,those of the Blind Institute; though much taste is displayed in the
4922,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"arrangement of the walks, and selection of many and choice specimens"
4923,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,of rare and beauteous flowers and shrubbery. You enter the main
4924,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"building, after ascending a flight of granite steps, through a portico"
4925,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"of Ionic architecture, supported by four graceful pillars. The first"
4926,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,apartment which we enter is the _chapel_. On either side of the pulpit
4927,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"are painted in beautiful gilt letters, the Ten Commandments; in the"
4928,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,opposite end of the room stands a large and handsome organ; the dome
4929,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,and walls are beautifully frescoed. The pulpit is occupied every
4930,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,Sabbath evening by some one of the ministers of the various evangelical
4931,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,denominations worshipping in Staunton. All these bespeak that these
4932,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,poor demented creatures are not forgotten on the Sabbath; and even
4933,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,where a few sparks of intellect linger amid the ashes of minds once
4934,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"proud and noble, it is interesting to see how those sparks are kindled"
4935,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,anew by the light of religion.
4936,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4937,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"After wending our way through various other portions of the buildings,"
4938,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,and stopping here and there to bestow a hasty glance at one and
4939,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"another rare specimen of curiously carved workmanship, by some lunatic"
4940,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"genius, we find ourselves gazing through iron bars at a scene which"
4941,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,would cause the most unfeeling heart to shudder with horror. There are
4942,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"grouped together, in the narrow confines of four tall brick walls, not"
4943,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,less than a hundred patients in the very worst stages of lunacy. It
4944,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,seems that the darkest cavern in the regions of Despair could present
4945,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,no more heart-rending picture.
4946,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4947,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"The wild glare of the piercing eye, the dishevelled locks; the"
4948,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,meaningless gibberish; the incoherent babbling; the fiendish ravings
4949,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"that rent the silent air, together with numberless other acts which"
4950,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"constitute the sum of a poor maniac’s life, have left an impression on"
4951,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,our mind that will go with us to our grave.

4956,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s eye, tongue, sword;"
4957,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"The glass of fashion, and the mould of form,"
4958,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"The observed of all observers, quite, quite down.”"
4959,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4960,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"We willingly leave such scenes, and turn our ready steps to an"
4961,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"observatory which crowns the main building, and commands one of the"
4962,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,loveliest views we ever witnessed.
4963,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4964,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Let us forget the painful sights we have just beheld, and drink in the"
4965,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,resplendent beauty of nature as she stands robed in the crimson folds
4966,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,of evening—
4967,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4968,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,“For the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.”
4969,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4970,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Beneath us are the various buildings of the Asylum, glittering, like"
4971,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"burnished gold, in the rays of the setting sun. To the north rise the"
4972,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"graceful proportions of the Blind Institute, nestled in its grove of"
4973,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,wide-spreading oaks; to the west are seen the heaven-pointing spires
4974,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,and beautiful residences of Staunton; to the east is the graveyard of
4975,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"the asylum, with its plain, upright marble slabs, marking the spot"
4976,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,where slumber the remains of many a friendless maniac; to the south
4977,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"is one wide-extended view of sloping hills, smiling valleys, sunlit"
4978,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"streams and snow-white cottages, dotted over the scene like stars in"
4979,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,the blue canopy of heaven.
4980,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4981,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,Who can look upon such a prospect and not feel his thoughts turn from
4982,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,nature to nature’s God?
4983,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4984,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,“All things are calm and fair and passive; earth
4985,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Looks as if lulled upon an angel’s lap,"
4986,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Into a breathless, dewy slumber: so still"
4987,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"That we can only say of things, they be.”—FESTUS."
4988,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4989,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,The gathering darkness reminds us that we have trespassed too long on
4990,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,the kindness of the gentleman who has so cheerfully shown us through
4991,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"the many apartments of this truly noble institution, whose object is to"
4992,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,ameliorate the condition of the suffering maniac.
4993,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4994,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"We bid her, her directors and her officers “God-speed” in their noble"
4995,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"enterprise, and earnestly pray that they may continue “blessing and"
4996,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,being blessed” until the light of reason shall be shed abroad in the
4997,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,darkened intellect of every lunatic in our land.
4998,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,
4999,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,There are many other points which we might mention; but they are of
5000,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"such a nature as only to sicken the heart, and we pass them by in"
5001,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"silence, simply remarking that if there be one crowning blessing for"
5002,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,which our hearts should ever be outgushing in grateful thanks to our
5003,THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.,"Heavenly Father, it is REASON."
