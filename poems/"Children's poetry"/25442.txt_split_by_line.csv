283,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"Once upon a time there was an old pig with three little pigs, and as she"
284,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune."
285,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to"
286,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"him, ""Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house;"" which the"
287,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently came along"
288,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said,--"
289,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
290,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
291,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
292,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"To which the pig answered,--"

294,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin."""
295,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
296,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"The wolf then answered to that,--"
297,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
298,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."""
299,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
300,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and eat up the"

302,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
303,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said,"
304,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Please man give me that furze to build a house;"" which the man did, and"
305,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"the pig built his house. Then along came the wolf, and said,--"

317,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
318,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said, ""Please,"
319,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"man, give me those bricks to build a house with;"" so the man gave him"
320,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the wolf came, as he"
321,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"did to the other little pigs, and said,--"
322,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,
323,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""

334,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"puffed, and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he"
335,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the"
336,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"house down, he said, ""Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of"
337,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"turnips."" ""Where?"" said the little pig. ""Oh, in Mr. Smith's Home-field,"
338,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"and if you will be ready to-morrow morning I will call for you, and we"
339,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"will go together, and get some for dinner."" ""Very well,"" said the little"
340,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"pig ""I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?"" ""Oh, at six"
341,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"o'clock."" Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips"
342,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"before the wolf came--(which he did about six)--and said, ""Little pig,"
343,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"are you ready?"" The little pig said, ""Ready! I have been, and come"
344,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner."" The wolf felt very"
345,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow"
346,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"or other, so he said, ""Little pig, I know where there is a nice"
347,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"apple-tree."" ""Where?"" said the pig. ""Down at Merry-garden,"" replied the"
348,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"wolf, ""and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five"
349,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples."" Well,"
350,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and went off"
351,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but he had"
352,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming"
353,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may suppose,"
354,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"frightened him very much. When the wolf came up he said, ""Little pig,"
355,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?"" ""Yes, very,"" said"
356,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"the little pig. ""I will throw you down one;"" and he threw it so far,"
357,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down"
358,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little"
359,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"pig, ""Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you"
360,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"go?"" ""Oh yes,"" said the pig, ""I will go: what time shall you be ready?"""
361,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"""At three,"" said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time as"
362,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was"
363,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"going home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell"
364,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned"
365,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which"
366,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"frightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the fair."
367,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had"
368,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him. Then the
369,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"little pig said, ""Ha! I frightened you then. I had been to the fair and"
370,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it and rolled down"
371,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"the hill."" Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would"
372,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"eat up the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him."
373,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of"
374,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"water, and made up a blazing fire, and just as the wolf was coming down,"
375,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the"
376,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,"cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and eat him for supper, and"
377,THE STORY OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS.,lived happy ever afterwards.

398,PUSS IN BOOTS.,Once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons. When he was
399,PUSS IN BOOTS.,dying he left each of them a legacy. To his eldest son he left his mill;
400,PUSS IN BOOTS.,to the second his ass; and to the youngest his cat. The poor boy was
401,PUSS IN BOOTS.,very sad when he found that he had nothing belonging to him but a cat;
402,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"but to his great surprise, puss jumped on the table, and said in a"
403,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"friendly manner: ""Do not be sad my dear master. Only buy me a pair of"
404,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"boots and a bag, and I will provide for you and myself."" So the miller's"
405,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"son, who had a shilling or two in his pocket, bought a smart little pair"
406,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"of boots and a bag, and gave them to puss, who put some bran and"
407,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"sow-thistles into his bag, opened the mouth of it, and lay down in a"
408,PUSS IN BOOTS.,rabbit warren. A foolish young rabbit jumped into it; puss drew the
409,PUSS IN BOOTS.,string and soon killed it. He went immediately to the palace with it. He
410,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"found the king and queen sitting on their throne; and bowing low, he"
411,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"laid the rabbit at the king's feet, saying: ""Please your majesty, my"
412,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"master, the Marquis de Carrabas, has sent you a rabbit from his warren,"
413,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"as a mark of respect."" ""I am much obliged to the Marquis,"" said the"
414,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"king, and he ordered the rabbit to be taken to the cook, and a piece"
415,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"of money to be given to the cat. Puss, much pleased, took a rabbit daily"
416,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"to the king as a gift from his master, till his majesty was well"
417,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"acquainted with the name of the Marquis de Carrabas, and with his"
418,PUSS IN BOOTS.,wonderful cat. There was a very rich and cruel Ogre living in that
419,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"country. One day puss went to call on him, and the ogre was quite amazed"
420,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"at hearing a cat talk; it was the first time too he had seen a ""Puss in"
421,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"Boots."" ""Is it true, most wonderful ogre,"" said Puss, ""that you can"
422,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"change yourself into any creature you please?"" ""Quite true, as you shall"
423,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"see,"" said the ogre, and he changed himself into a lion, and roared so"
424,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"terribly, that the cat climbed up the wall out of his way. Then the ogre"
425,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"resumed his own ugly shape, and laughed at puss's fear. ""It was very"
426,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"surprising,"" said the cat; ""you are of such a grand size that I do not"
427,PUSS IN BOOTS.,wonder you could become a lion--but could you change yourself into some
428,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"very small animal?"" ""You shall see,"" said the stupid vain ogre, and he"
429,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"turned into a mouse. Directly puss saw him in that shape, he darted at"
430,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"him and eat him up. The ogre quite deserved it, for he had eaten many"
431,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"men himself. Then puss made haste back to his master, and said, ""Come"
432,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"and bathe in the river, and when the king comes by, do exactly as I tell"
433,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"you, for I see his carriage."" The miller's son obeyed his friend the"
434,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"cat, undressed and jumped into the water, and cunning puss ran away with"
435,PUSS IN BOOTS.,his clothes and hid them under a large stone. By-and-bye the king
436,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"drove by with his daughter. Puss began to call very loud ""Help, help! or"
437,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"my lord Marquis de Carrabas will be drowned."" The king stopped the coach"
438,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"directly, and asked what was the matter. Puss answered, that while his"
439,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"master was bathing, some thieves had stolen his clothes, and that"
440,PUSS IN BOOTS.,therefore the marquis could not come out of the water. The king luckily
441,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"had a dress suit with him, so he sent it by a servant to the Marquis,"
442,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"and desired him to accept a seat in the royal coach, and he would drive"
443,PUSS IN BOOTS.,him home.

448,PUSS IN BOOTS.,
449,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"The miller's son looked very well in his fine clothes, and the king was"
450,PUSS IN BOOTS.,pleased with his appearance. Puss directed the coachman to drive to the
451,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"late ogre's castle, and then he ran on before. Coming to a large field"
452,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"in which reapers were at work, he said, ""If the king asks you to whom"
453,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"these fields belong, you must say, to the Marquis de Carrabas, or you"
454,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"shall all be chopped as small as mincemeat."" The men were so astonished"
455,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"at hearing a cat talk, that they dared not refuse; so when the king came"
456,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"by and asked, whose fields are these? they said, ""they belong to the"
457,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"Marquis de Carrabas."" Next puss came to some meadows with shepherds and"
458,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"flocks of sheep, and said the same to them. So when the king asked them,"
459,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"whose flocks are these? they answered, those of the Marquis de Carrabas."
460,PUSS IN BOOTS.,
461,PUSS IN BOOTS.,[Illustration]
462,PUSS IN BOOTS.,
463,PUSS IN BOOTS.,Puss ran on all over the dead ogre's land and said the same thing to
464,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"the woodmen and the gamekeepers on the road, who all obeyed him, till"
465,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"the king at last said to the miller's son, ""You have a fine property, my"
466,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"lord Marquis de Carrabas."" When puss came to the ogre's castle, he stood"
467,PUSS IN BOOTS.,on the steps and waited till the coach drove up.
468,PUSS IN BOOTS.,
469,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"""Will your majesty honour my lord by taking some refreshment,"" he said;"
470,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"and the king who had not so fine a castle belonging to himself, alighted"
471,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"from his carriage and entered the house. Now, the ogre was just going to"
472,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"his dinner when puss had called and killed him, so there was a very fine"
473,PUSS IN BOOTS.,feast upon the table. Puss told the ogre's servants they should be made
474,PUSS IN BOOTS.,into mincemeat if they did not consent to take the Marquis de Carrabas
475,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"for their master, and they were glad to serve him instead of the ogre."
476,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"The king took such a fancy to the rich Marquis de Carrabas, that he gave"
477,PUSS IN BOOTS.,him the princess for his wife. They lived in the ogre's fine castle
478,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"(which puss presented to his master), and the most faithful and the"
479,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"happiest of their servants was ""Puss in Boots."""

495,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
496,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,Once there was a duck who had just hatched a brood of ducklings; one of
497,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"them had been longer coming out of the shell than the others, and when"
498,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,it came it was very ugly. But its mother did not love it less on that
499,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,account; mothers never think their little ones ugly. It could swim very
500,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"well, so she knew it was not a young turkey, as an old duck had said it"
501,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"might be, and she took it with all the rest of the brood to the"
502,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"farm-yard to introduce it into good society. An old turkey, who was very"
503,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"grand, came up to the duck, and said, ""Your children are all pretty"
504,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,except one. There is one ugly duckling. I wish you could improve him a
505,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"little."" ""That is impossible, your grace,"" replied the mother, ""he is"
506,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"not pretty; but he has a good disposition, and swims even better than"
507,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"the others."" ""Well, the other ducklings are graceful enough,"" said the"
508,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"turkey, ""pray make yourselves at home, here."""
509,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
510,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,But how could the ugly duckling do so? The whole farm-yard laughed at
511,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"him. The ducks pecked him, the fowls beat him, the girl who fed the"
512,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,poultry drove him away with a stick.
513,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
514,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,[Illustration]
515,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
516,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"The poor duckling flew over the pailings, and joined some wild ducks who"
517,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"lived on the moor. ""You are very ugly,"" said the wild ducks; ""but that"
518,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"will not matter if you do not want to marry into our family."" After he"
519,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"had been on the moor two days, he made friends with some wild geese, and"
520,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"had nearly consented to fly over the sea with them, when ""pop, pop,"""
521,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"went a gun, and the poor gosling fell dead in the water. The poor"
522,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,duckling was so frightened that he hid himself amongst the rushes. When
523,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"all was quiet again, he came out and ran over the moor till he reached a"
524,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"tumble-down cottage, the door of which was ajar. He crept in, and stayed"
525,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"there all night. A woman, a cat, and a hen lived in this cottage. The"
526,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"hen had such short legs that her mistress called her ""Chickie short"
527,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"legs."" The old woman let the duckling live in her house, hoping that"
528,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"by-and-bye it might lay eggs. Now the cat was the master of the house,"
529,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"and the hen was the mistress, and they always said, ""We and the world,"""
530,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"because they thought themselves half the world, at least. One day the"
531,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"duckling said sadly, ""It is very dull here, how much I should like to"
532,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"swim in the water and to dive."" ""What a foolish idea,"" said the hen."
533,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"""You have nothing else to do, therefore you have strange fancies. If you"
534,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"could purr or lay eggs they would pass away; ask the cat, he is the"
535,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"cleverest animal I know, if _he_ would like to dive in the water; ask"
536,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"our old mistress, there is no one in the world more clever than she"
537,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"is; do you think she would like to let the water close over her head?"""
538,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"""You don't understand me,"" said the duckling. ""I think I must go into"
539,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"the world again."" ""Very well, go,"" said the hen; and the duckling went."

544,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
545,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"Very near the cottage he found some water, where he could swim and dive;"
546,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"but all creatures avoided him because he was so ugly, therefore he was"
547,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,always alone. One evening there came a beautiful flock of birds out of
548,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"the bushes. They curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage"
549,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,shone with dazzling whiteness. The duckling felt quite a strange
550,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,sensation as he watched them fly up in the air. He stretched out his
551,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened"
552,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,himself. How he loved the white birds! how he longed to be with them.
553,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
554,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"By-and-bye winter came, and froze the water quite hard. The ice crackled"
555,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"round the duckling and at last shut him in, so that he could not get"
556,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,out. Early in the morning a peasant who was passing saw what had
557,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"happened, broke the ice with his axe, took up the duckling, and carried"
558,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,it home to his wife.
559,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
560,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,[Illustration]
561,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
562,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,The warmth revived the poor thing and it began to fly about; the
563,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"children wanted to play with it, but they only frightened it; it ran to"
564,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"the door which was open, and managed to slip away among the bushes,"
565,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,where it lay down in the new fallen snow.
566,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,
567,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,It would be very sad to tell you all the duckling suffered that cold
568,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"winter; but spring came at last, and the young bird felt that his wings"
569,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"were grown strong. He flew away, and stopped at last in a beautiful"
570,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,garden near a fine piece of water. On it he saw two magnificent white
571,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"birds swimming. ""I will fly to those royal birds,"" he thought, ""they"
572,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,will kill me because I am ugly; but I had rather be killed by them than
573,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"pecked by ducks, or beaten by hens."" So he flew to the water and swam"
574,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"towards the swans. ""Kill me,"" he said, as they sailed towards him, and"
575,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,he bowed his head meekly. But what did he see in the stream? Not a dark
576,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"grey ugly duckling, but a beautiful swan! To be born in a duck's nest in"
577,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"a farm-yard, does not matter to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's"
578,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"egg. Yes, he too was a swan. Now he would have friends to love him, and"
579,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"nobody would scorn and ill-use him any more. Ho rustled his feathers,"
580,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"curved his slender neck and cried joyfully, ""I never thought such good"
581,THE UGLY DUCKLING.,"was in store for me when I was an ugly duckling."""
