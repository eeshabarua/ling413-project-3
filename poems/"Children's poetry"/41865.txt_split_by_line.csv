58,PREFACE.,
59,PREFACE.,Recollections of the many pleasant hours passed with a certain juvenile
60,PREFACE.,"circle, not fifty miles from Boston, and associations connected with"
61,PREFACE.,"this joyous season, have induced the feeble effort of collecting a few"
62,PREFACE.,"stray leaves for its amusement. Hoping that their many defects, arising"
63,PREFACE.,"from a hasty preparation amid various cares and occupations, may be"
64,PREFACE.,"kindly pardoned, they are presented as a trifling Gift for the Holidays."
65,PREFACE.,
66,PREFACE.,"To that group, bound together by a mutual sympathy in each other's joys"
67,PREFACE.,"and fleeting sorrows, it may not be uninteresting to recall the days of"
68,PREFACE.,"""Auld Lang Syne."" The scene will be a chequered one, for amid the frolic"
69,PREFACE.,"and sunshine, some tears will have been shed; while with hours of hard"
70,PREFACE.,"and thoughtful study, the bitterness of failure will sometimes appear."
71,PREFACE.,
72,PREFACE.,"But the bright and beautiful so far prevail over the rest, that such"
73,PREFACE.,"only need be recalled; and while enjoying those sweet remembrances, let"
74,PREFACE.,us be merry and glad together. With truth and goodness as our constant
75,PREFACE.,"aim, let us strive to make daily progress in the school of life, and"
76,PREFACE.,"though we may be separated on Earth, we may hope for a blissful reunion"
77,PREFACE.,in Heaven.

160,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,MY DEAR CHILDREN:
161,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
162,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,As I have always been in the habit of meeting with you on this
163,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"Anniversary, and as I cannot expect to see you all together this year,"
164,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,for the sake of old times I am going to write you a letter. Perhaps you
165,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,are not aware that I have been a silent spectator of your daily
166,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"occupations, but so it is."
167,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
168,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"I generally take a nap from one year to another, so after our glorious"
169,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"celebration at the ""Bee-Hive,"" I packed myself away in the stove-pipe"
170,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"for that purpose; but the hum of merry voices kept me awake, and thus I"
171,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"lay and listened to what was going on. The fairies, in whom you perhaps"
172,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"all believe, have also been quite numerous in your vicinity, and from"
173,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"my relationship to them, I have often heard of your excursions over hill"
174,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"and dale, and the many gay times you have enjoyed together."
175,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
176,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"I travel over many regions at this season of the year, and in order to"
177,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"accomplish all I wish, in my endeavors to please the young folks, I"
178,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"shall begin my preparations a little earlier than usual, so you need not"
179,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"wonder if I visit some of you a little before Christmas and New Year,"
180,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,with one of my gifts. This will consist of a few of the simplest little
181,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"sketches, letters, and reminiscenses of the various occurrences in which"
182,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"you have participated, and I hope the contents of this ""Christmas Bough"""
183,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"will give you as much satisfaction as those of by-gone seasons, when the"
184,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,festive pine-tree erected to my honor has been loaded with gay and
185,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,glittering gifts.
186,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
187,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"I trust you will all enjoy the holiday, and with glad and grateful"
188,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"hearts fully appreciate the many privileges you enjoy, as the children"
189,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"of kind parents, and the objects of interest to affectionate friends. Of"
190,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,course you will be most forcibly reminded of the Giver of all these
191,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"blessings, and you will love to listen about the ""gentle child Jesus,"""
192,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,in honor of whose birth the day is celebrated.
193,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
194,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"By looking back upon the past year, you can see what steps you have"
195,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"taken in self-improvement, what you have learned, what left unlearned;"
196,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"and the retrospect will help you to form new plans for the future, which"
197,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,now rises bright and beautifully before you. One little girl will have
198,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"the satisfaction of having almost conquered a peevish temper, which made"
199,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,her very disagreeable; another will have acquired habits of neatness and
200,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"order, so necessary to comfort and enjoyment."
201,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
202,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"This scholar will have an increase of memory, and thus avoid the"
203,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"repetition of that troublesome phrase, ""Oh, I forgot;"" and that one will"
204,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"become more thoughtful, and will not consider the excuse, ""I didn't"
205,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"think,"" sufficient to cover her frequent blunders. A nice, hearty"
206,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"little fellow that I know will have learned to read fluently, and to"
207,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,love his books for the sake of all the good and pleasant things he can
208,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,find in them; while another rogue will be kind and gentle to his
209,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"sisters, and give up the naughty habit of teasing his companions. The"
210,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"proud child will learn her true value, and not think herself better than"
211,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"her mates, on account of her pretty face, fine clothes, or handsome"
212,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"residence; while best of all these changes, the cowardly and deceitful"
213,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"will be ever brave and truthful, finding that honesty is the greatest"
214,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"safeguard, and truthfulness a shield from many temptations."
215,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
216,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"All foolish quarrels will be forgotten, and the spirit of love and good"
217,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"will pervade all their actions, as the children resolve to aid their"
218,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"kind parents in family cares, the brother and sister mutually assisting"
219,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"each other, and with cheerful, bright faces make a perpetual sunshine at"
220,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"home. In this delightful progress, the claims of those who have always"
221,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"served you as devoted domestics, will not be forgotten; and by your"
222,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"thoughtfulness, you can thus atone for many an unkind word or heedless"
223,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,exaction on your part.
224,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,
225,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"As children of benevolent parents, you will help to bestow gifts upon"
226,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"the poor and needy, and nothing, I know from watching you all, will be"
227,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,more pleasant than this part of the Christmas rejoicings. I shall want
228,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"to hear from you in answer to this lengthy epistle, for I know you are"
229,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,all used to writing; and be assured I shall ever feel a sincere and
230,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"hearty interest in your welfare, and whatever may be your position in"
231,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"life, memory will carry me back to the happy days spent in the pretty"
232,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"village of D. And now, as I draw on my seven-leagued boots for other"
233,MY DEAR CHILDREN:,"scenes, I will wish you all a ""Merry Christmas,"" and a ""Happy New Year."""

243,RIGOLETTE.,"A little girl, thinking it was very difficult to write compositions,"
244,RIGOLETTE.,"once went to her teacher, and said, ""Will you please tell me how to"

246,RIGOLETTE.,"you were to relate the subject to me?"" ""Oh! it would be very easy to"
247,RIGOLETTE.,"_talk_ it all, but to _write_ it properly is very hard."" ""Well, my dear,"
248,RIGOLETTE.,"just suppose yourself talking to me, and for once forget the"
249,RIGOLETTE.,"difficulties of a composition, and I have no doubt you will succeed."""
250,RIGOLETTE.,"Pointing to an engraving of Rigolette, she continued, ""Go and write a"

259,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"a moment, to listen to the singing of the birds. Her face is very"
260,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,beautiful; her hair is dark and neatly parted on her forehead. Her eyes
261,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"are brown, perhaps black; her nose straight, her cheeks rosy, and her"
262,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"mouth sweet and smiling. She has a handkerchief tied round her head, and"
263,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"she wears a dark, nice-fitting dress. The furniture in the room is a"
264,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"large old-fashioned table, a high-back chair, and on the window-seat is"
265,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"a pot of pretty flowers. The green blind is drawn up, and in the"
266,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"distance, the top of a church is seen, so I suppose the room is very"
267,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"high. The birds' cage is covered with chick-weed and flowers, and I"
268,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,guess they are very happy and contented. Her hands are white and

273,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"written: ""Rigolette was a young French girl, in Paris, and earned her"
274,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,livelihood by following the trade of a seamstress. She had been left an
275,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"orphan at a very early age, but from her joyous, happy temperament, she"
276,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"had acquired her name, which signifies 'The Warbler.' For the people who"
277,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"adopted her, she performed the duties of a faithful daughter, and was"
278,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"ever cheerful, active, and industrious. She was placed in the midst of"

284,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"her companions; and solaced by their songs, with the native buoyancy of"
285,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"youth and health, she passed a busy, contented life. Though possessing"
286,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"very limited means, she was most charitable, supporting a poor family"
287,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"for a whole winter, and often cheering the sick and lonely. She was"
288,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"proverbial, in all the neighborhood, for her neatness, taste, industry,"
289,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"good humor, and active benevolence. She thus became the friend, the"
290,HERE IS THE COMPOSITION.,"assistant, the confident, and adviser, whenever it was in her power to"

324,A STORY FOR MINNA.,"There was once a little mouse, that was kept in a nice little trap, and"
325,A STORY FOR MINNA.,"carefully tended by many good children. It was a great pet, and grew fat"

330,A STORY FOR MINNA.,"Sometimes it would wash its face like a kitten, and then, after a race"

499,"RIVER-SIDE, ST. CHARLES.","lessons, or any steady effort to acquire good habits. Our attempts at"
500,"RIVER-SIDE, ST. CHARLES.","Composition, the subject of so many sighs and groans, and the great"

505,"RIVER-SIDE, ST. CHARLES.","When my children have been very good, I entertain them with a perusal of"

662,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,write you a letter. We are all very sorry that you are not well enough
663,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"to be in school yet, but are hoping every day to see you again. I will"
664,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"write you something about our Christmas celebration, as it was the"
665,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"pleasantest we have ever had yet, I think."
666,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
667,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,We were very busy for a good while before making things to put on the
668,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"tree, and there was a great deal of whispering every day with our"
669,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"teacher, who helped us all, and had to keep a great many secrets. Then"
670,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"we practised our prettiest songs from the School-Singer, and recited"
671,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"our different pieces of poetry, and besides all that we reviewed a good"
672,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"many lessons. When the day itself came, we were almost crazy with"
673,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"delight, and with the many things we had to do. Some of us left"
674,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"invitations for the parents and all the old scholars to come, some"
675,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"helped make the curtains, which altered the school-room so you would not"
676,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,have known it. Some of us helped make evergreen trimming to dress the
677,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"walls, while the boys went after two beautiful pine trees, to put at the"
678,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"end of the room, and some of us fixed the candles in tin stands which we"
679,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,called our silver chandeliers. The young ladies were busy trimming the
680,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"church close by, so we could run in there for a minute, to look at the"
681,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"beautiful great Cross behind the pulpit, and the wreaths and festoons,"
682,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,for the people were going to celebrate Christmas eve.
683,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
684,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Then in the afternoon we brought all our presents to put on the trees,"
685,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"and they looked beautifully, and there were so many things we had to"
686,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"have a table besides. Then we made a platform of the benches, and fixed"
687,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,the chairs all round the room for the company; the boys put up a curtain
688,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"for us in front of the trees, and after every thing was ready, we"
689,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,arranged ourselves as we were to sit in the evening. Soon after tea we
690,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"all went to the school-room early, and I brought a rake and some hay,"
691,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,for I was to be one of the seasons.
692,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
693,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"There was an address by one of the young gentlemen, and then we all sang"
694,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"a Christmas song, but I felt so frightened, I could'nt sing very loud."
695,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Then the curtains dropped, and we were arranged as the four seasons."
696,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"When it was raised, the two Marys represented Spring; I was Summer, with"
697,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"a broad-brimmed hat on, and a rake in my hand, and little Emma sat by my"
698,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"side, holding flowers. I said the mower's song, and then we all sang"
699,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"another piece. Next came N., dressed as Autumn, with a beautiful wreath"
700,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"of dried grasses on her head, a sickle in her hand, and close by her"
701,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"side, dear little Lena knelt with a basket of grapes and apples. Then"
702,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Ellen appeared as ""Winter,"" dressed in a red tunic trimmed with white"
703,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"fur, a muff in her hands, and a fur cap on her head, and she looked very"
704,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"pretty. ""Jack Frost"" was at her feet kneeling on a sled, with skates on"
705,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"his shoulders; he said a long piece of poetry about ""Christmas Eve,"" and"
706,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,every now and then he rattled some sleigh-bells.
707,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
708,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"After the ""Four Seasons,"" two of the smallest children stood up a minute"
709,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"as ""Day and Night""; one of them, with rosy cheeks, blue eyes, and light"
710,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"hair, had a white veil thrown over her head, and the other, with coal"
711,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"black eyes, and dark hair, had on a black veil, and I think it was the"
712,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"prettiest thing we had. Dear Abby was the ""New Year"" of 1849, holding a"
713,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"large silver cross in her hand, and she said her piece beautifully. Then"
714,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Agnes came out as the ""Old Year,"" dressed as an old woman with a"
715,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"high-crowned cap; she said her piece very perfectly, and she made every"
716,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"body laugh, she did her part so well."
717,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
718,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Last of all, Santa Claus appeared, all dressed in furs, and holding a"
719,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"bag of presents, and then we all sang together our last song, a great"
720,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,deal better than the others.
721,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
722,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"A gentleman then helped give out the presents, but there was such a"
723,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"crowd, it was hard work to get them. Just then one of the trees caught"
724,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"fire; and _somebody_ rushing to put it out, tipped over one of the"
725,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"trees, making a great crash, but no harm was done. It took almost an"
726,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"hour to give the presents, and after that we all went home with our arms"
727,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,full of pretty things. The next day we came to the school-room to look
728,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"over our gifts, and put the room to rights; then we had some cake and"
729,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"peanuts, instead of the night before; for you know that is always our"
730,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"usual treat, and then we all went to church together."
731,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
732,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"I hear you had a great many presents, and we hope you liked those the"
733,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"scholars sent you. It has been very cold since Christmas, so we have not"
734,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"had any sleigh-rides, but we have been on the ice almost every"
735,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"afternoon, and we have fine times sliding and skating. The great girls"
736,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"go by moonlight, and have been up to Wigwam Pond, which is just like a"
737,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,silver floor.
738,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
739,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,Do you remember those times when we used to slide on your pond near the
740,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"old mill, and how we cried if we fell down or our fingers were cold? The"
741,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"little brook all frozen up and filled with crystals, we thought was like"
742,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"a Fairy's palace, it was so glittering and had so many colors."
743,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
744,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"Every day, at noon, when the snow is soft, we make snow forts, and we"
745,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"have made a great snow man, which is our giant, and at night he gets"
746,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"real hard. Then we play ""English and Americans,"" like our history"
747,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"lessons, but the Americans always beat, because the most girls take that"
748,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"side. We all send love to you, and many kisses, and hope you will soon"
749,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,"get well, for we are getting on very fast with our lessons."
750,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,
751,NEW YEAR'S DAY.,A Happy New Year to you.

1008,THE OAKS.,THE OAKS.
1009,THE OAKS.,
1010,THE OAKS.,My dear Daughter:
1011,THE OAKS.,
1012,THE OAKS.,"I was very glad to hear from you, and I hope you continue as well as"
1013,THE OAKS.,"when you left home; for, of course, I consider your health of the"
1014,THE OAKS.,"greatest importance. To preserve this, I am excessively anxious to have"
1015,THE OAKS.,"you walk regularly every day, as often as twice, if possible. Be sure"
1016,THE OAKS.,"and keep up the habit of cold bathing, and do not forget your usual"
1017,THE OAKS.,"attention to your nails, teeth, and hair, for though I am not near to"
1018,THE OAKS.,"remind you of this care, you are now old enough to take it upon"
1019,THE OAKS.,"yourself. Remember the gold pencil your father has offered, if you cure"
1020,THE OAKS.,yourself of the disagreeable habit of biting your nails; so make the
1021,THE OAKS.,"effort, at least for his sake."
1022,THE OAKS.,
1023,THE OAKS.,"Try hard to have all your lessons well prepared out of school, so that"
1024,THE OAKS.,"there will be time to look them over; and then if any difficulty occurs,"
1025,THE OAKS.,"it may be solved by the Teacher before recitation. While reciting, pay"
1026,THE OAKS.,"strict attention to all the explanations and illustrations given, for"
1027,THE OAKS.,"these are often of more value than the mere text, and by your interest"
1028,THE OAKS.,you will make light the labor of instruction.
1029,THE OAKS.,
1030,THE OAKS.,"Be punctual in your hours of attendance, for then no time will be lost,"
1031,THE OAKS.,"and a valuable habit will be formed, of great use in after life."
1032,THE OAKS.,
1033,THE OAKS.,Of course your social disposition will lead you to get acquainted with
1034,THE OAKS.,"the other girls; but do be particular in your choice of companions, and"
1035,THE OAKS.,"always ask yourself, if they are such as your parents would approve, or"
1036,THE OAKS.,will tend to improve you.
1037,THE OAKS.,
1038,THE OAKS.,"Do not in any case repeat the sayings of one scholar to another, for"
1039,THE OAKS.,"nothing is more hateful than a habit of tattling, or a greater cause of"
1040,THE OAKS.,mischief and unhappiness. Do not fancy it is the sign of a frank
1041,THE OAKS.,"disposition, to report the harsh sayings made by one girl to another,"
1042,THE OAKS.,"but on the contrary, try to create peace and love among all your mates."
1043,THE OAKS.,
1044,THE OAKS.,"Above all, be pleasant and affectionate in your bearing to your"
1045,THE OAKS.,"Teachers, for nothing will more quickly endear you to them, or so fully"
1046,THE OAKS.,repay them for all their labors for your improvement.
1047,THE OAKS.,
1048,THE OAKS.,"Do not forget my advice about romping with boys, a common habit with"
1049,THE OAKS.,"school-girls of your age; it is very foolish, and liable to be carried"
1050,THE OAKS.,"to excess, as you yourself know, in the late troubles at the Academy"
1051,THE OAKS.,"here. Be always truthful, and learn to bear a laugh at your expense,"
1052,THE OAKS.,when you know you are in the right; for ridicule is far lighter to bear
1053,THE OAKS.,"than the reproaches of conscience. You are so sensitive by nature, that"
1054,THE OAKS.,"I shall particularly caution you in this respect, as I know your tears"
1055,THE OAKS.,"are apt to overflow, even at trifling occurrences. These directions I"
1056,THE OAKS.,"hope will not seem too tedious to you, as my motive for sending them,"
1057,THE OAKS.,"is to make your duties lighter, and the time spent away from home more"
1058,THE OAKS.,profitable.
1059,THE OAKS.,
1060,THE OAKS.,"All these regulations are not incompatible with plenty of recreation,"
1061,THE OAKS.,"and when you play, do it in earnest; give full vent to your over-flowing"
1062,THE OAKS.,"spirits, and take plenty of exercise with your hoop and ball. It is a"
1063,THE OAKS.,"pleasant sight to see a young girl enjoying her games, and the one who"
1064,THE OAKS.,"works and studies the hardest, will play with the greatest zest."
1065,THE OAKS.,
1066,THE OAKS.,"I particularly depend upon your keeping a journal, and anticipate great"
1067,THE OAKS.,"pleasure in reading it; for any thing interesting to you, no matter how"
1068,THE OAKS.,"trifling, will be interesting to me. Write to me often, freely and"
1069,THE OAKS.,"unreservedly, and if you will just imagine you are talking to me, you"
1070,THE OAKS.,will have no difficulty in keeping up quite a correspondence with me. If
1071,THE OAKS.,"I am ambitious for you in any one point, it is that you should be a"
1072,THE OAKS.,"fluent writer, and should excel in Composition."
1073,THE OAKS.,
1074,THE OAKS.,"When you return home, if I see that you have improved your time, and"
1075,THE OAKS.,"appreciate the advantages of attending Mr. C.'s school, I will do all I"
1076,THE OAKS.,can to make the vacation pass pleasantly. Besides a certain amount of
1077,THE OAKS.,"reading and sewing, you are to enjoy yourself, riding, walking, and"
1078,THE OAKS.,"visiting as you fancy, for I mean to have the time a season of"
1079,THE OAKS.,recreation.
1080,THE OAKS.,
1081,THE OAKS.,"How do you like taking dancing lessons, and are you holding yourself"
1082,THE OAKS.,"more erect than formerly? As to your request about music lessons, I"
1083,THE OAKS.,"think you had better give up that plan for the present, for you have as"
1084,THE OAKS.,"much as you ought to do, and in a few years, you will have more time to"
1085,THE OAKS.,"practise thoroughly. When you leave school, you shall have the best"
1086,THE OAKS.,instruction on the piano and in singing.
1087,THE OAKS.,

1317,A STORY FOR WILLIE.,a birthday was to be celebrated. It was too late for pleasant summer

1327,A STORY FOR WILLIE.,all concerned.
1328,A STORY FOR WILLIE.,
1329,A STORY FOR WILLIE.,"An ironing board placed upon two barrels, was converted into a beautiful"

1367,MY DEAR MOTHER:,MY DEAR MOTHER:
1368,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1369,MY DEAR MOTHER:,I was very glad indeed to get your letter last week. I will try to do
1370,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"all you wish, though I have already been silly enough to have one or two"
1371,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"crying spells. But I think I shall soon cure myself, for I have such"
1372,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"pleasant times, I have more cause for laughing than tears, and I mean to"
1373,MY DEAR MOTHER:,keep up the good habit.
1374,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1375,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"I have to study very hard, for the teacher is very particular; and the"
1376,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"scholars are so bright, that I must work to keep up with them. Out of"
1377,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"school we have grand times together, and this Spring we have formed a"
1378,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Club, which we call the ""Sunrise Society;"" and we get up very early and"
1379,MY DEAR MOTHER:,all go off to walk by six o'clock.
1380,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1381,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"We have been in every direction, and I only wish you knew the delightful"
1382,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"walks there are here. One of the pleasantest is to the ""Falls,"" near the"
1383,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"factories, through a narrow winding path, by the side of a beautiful"
1384,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"pond, the waters of which flow over a dam. As we look underneath the"
1385,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"bridge, the water rushes down with great rapidity and force, and the"
1386,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"noise is very loud. There is a beautiful grove close by, with rocks"
1387,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"scattered along the side of the stream, which runs quietly on after its"
1388,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"foaming, whirling jump over the dam, and it is a very romantic spot."
1389,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"There are many other pleasant places, called ""Rose Cottage;"" ""Lover's"
1390,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Lane;"" ""Sandy Valley;"" ""Powder House Rock;"" ""Spider's Village;"" ""Tyot"
1391,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Woods;"" ""Harrison Grove;"" ""West Retreat;"" and ""Purgatory;"" and when you"
1392,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"come, I will show them all to you."
1393,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1394,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"After school for the day is over, we often walk again; so you see I"
1395,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"shall have plenty of exercise. Yesterday, as there was no school, we"
1396,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"all went to the Court-House, to hear some speeches by two distinguished"
1397,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"lawyers, in a very interesting case, and the room was crowded. We went"
1398,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"early and carried our work, but we soon had to put it away for want of"
1399,MY DEAR MOTHER:,elbow room. We learned something about the manner of trying a case
1400,MY DEAR MOTHER:,before a jury. There was one speaker who was very much interested in
1401,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"what he was saying, and the ladies all seemed to like him the best; so I"
1402,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"hoped he would gain the case, and I believe he did."
1403,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1404,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Last week the weather was very warm and pleasant, so we rolled hoop at"
1405,MY DEAR MOTHER:,recess and had fine fun. In the afternoon we sew and draw; and lately we
1406,MY DEAR MOTHER:,have been making garments for a poor woman and her family in another
1407,MY DEAR MOTHER:,part of the town.
1408,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1409,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"After making up a large bundle, we all went to see her. She seemed very"
1410,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"much obliged to us, and dressed up her children to show us how nicely"
1411,MY DEAR MOTHER:,the clothes fitted. We have very interesting lessons in History about
1412,MY DEAR MOTHER:,the Queens of England; and besides that we have been reading about
1413,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Marie Antoinette, who suffered so dreadfully in the French Revolution."
1414,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1415,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"The little scholars have been reading some of ""Mary Howitt's tales;"""
1416,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"""The Cousins in Ohio;"" and the ""Life of Robert Swain,"" which is very"
1417,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"interesting. We are all very busy with Arithmetic, and as each one gets"
1418,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"through any difficult section, we receive a _pictured card_ as a sort of"
1419,MY DEAR MOTHER:,certificate. The little ones have been learning the Multiplication
1420,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Table, and one of them had a cunning little slate given to her, for"
1421,MY DEAR MOTHER:,reciting perfectly at the fortnight's review.
1422,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1423,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Last Saturday we all went into town with our teacher, to see ""Bayne's"
1424,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Panorama of a Voyage to Europe,"" and we had to write a description of it"
1425,MY DEAR MOTHER:,for our composition. We had a very pleasant time and it was very
1426,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"beautiful; though I can remember but little about the scenes, they came"
1427,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"so fast one after another. We all liked the storm at sea, the icebergs,"
1428,MY DEAR MOTHER:,and the views on the river Rhine very much; but we think Banvard's
1429,MY DEAR MOTHER:,Panorama of the Mississippi was the best. As we had been writing a
1430,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"description of the Telegraph, we stopped at a place where it was made,"
1431,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"examined all the different parts, and had them explained to us; and some"
1432,MY DEAR MOTHER:,of these days we are to see a message sent to New York.
1433,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1434,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"You ask me to tell you everything, so I will end my letter, by relating"
1435,MY DEAR MOTHER:,an event which took place in our school-room. As we were all sitting
1436,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"round the fire, studying our lessons, down tumbled the stove-pipe with a"
1437,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"tremendous noise, scattering soot in every direction. Fortunately no one"
1438,MY DEAR MOTHER:,was hurt; but we were all very much frightened. We had a longer play
1439,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"time than usual, while a man was repairing the damage."
1440,MY DEAR MOTHER:,
1441,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"P.S. I forgot to tell you that I went to see a little play performed,"
1442,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"called ""Old Poz."" We had a fine time, for all the characters were well"
1443,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"dressed and the parts were well acted. We did not have much scenery, but"
1444,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"that was no matter, we had such a grand curtain. After the play we had"
1445,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"a young ""Indian Girl,"" in complete costume, and ""The three Sisters of"
1446,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"Scio,"" which puzzled the audience very much indeed. I went to bed later"
1447,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"than usual, but I had all my lessons perfect the next day; so I do not"
1448,MY DEAR MOTHER:,"think it did me any harm. But if you do not like such things, I will not"
1449,MY DEAR MOTHER:,go again.

1617,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"On a dark, rainy day, two weary-looking street minstrels took shelter"
1618,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"from the storm, under the projecting roof of a horse shed. Not far from"
1619,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"the place stood a small but pretty school-house, in which might be seen"
1620,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"a group of bright-faced and busy children; some conning their lessons,"
1621,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"some reciting with earnest attention, and others rejoicing with"
1622,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"childhood's happy freedom from care, at a temporary release from some"
1623,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,expected recitation.
1624,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1625,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"The teacher, during the intervals of occupation, spied out the poor"
1626,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"wanderers, and feeling a desire to help them, she concluded to invite"
1627,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"them into the school-room, after receiving a promise from the"
1628,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"sympathizing circle, that the interruption should not interfere in the"
1629,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"least with their studies. Accordingly, the foreigners, who had begun to"
1630,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"find their covering insufficient against the drenching rain, very gladly"
1631,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"accepted the invitation, and modestly took their places at the farther"
1632,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,end of the apartment.
1633,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1634,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,Many bright and inquisitive eyes were turned upon them; but remembering
1635,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"their promise, the children again turned their prompt attention to their"
1636,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"various exercises, and while the strangers were busily engaged with some"
1637,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"books and a slate, they soon accomplished their required duties."
1638,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1639,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"As a reward for their attention, they were allowed at recess to listen"
1640,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"to several gay tunes upon the organ, accompanied by the tambourine, and"
1641,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,very soon their lively feet joined in a merry dance. After this
1642,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"irrepressible ebullition of their glee, they each played a tune"
1643,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"themselves, and when fully satisfied, voluntarily presented the tired"
1644,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"ones with donations from their luncheon baskets, and with flowers that"
1645,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,decked the room.
1646,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1647,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"With these the boy made a wreath for his sister's head, but the girl"
1648,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,adorned the little image of the virgin placed upon the organ; and then
1649,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"after a few entreaties, they both sang some German songs. In return the"
1650,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"scholars sang their prettiest pieces from the ""School Singer,"" and at"
1651,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"any familiar melody, the faces of the listeners beamed with pleasure and"
1652,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"delight. Before the group was dismissed for home, the boy asked for a"
1653,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"pen and paper; and during the time he was left alone, he wrote the"
1654,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,following history of himself and his pretty sister for the teacher and
1655,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,her scholars.
1656,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1657,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"""My name is Hendrik Glaubenstein, and I am fourteen years old. My sister"
1658,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"Gertruyd, who is as good as an angel, is just sixteen. We have left our"
1659,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"poor old father and mother in Germany, and have come to this happy"
1660,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,country to make money.
1661,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1662,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"I went to school every winter, and in summer I staid at home on account"
1663,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"of work; but after it was done, my sister and I studied together,"
1664,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"sometimes in the fields, sometimes in our little cabin. My sister"
1665,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"earned all she could by spinning yarn and knitting stockings, which I"
1666,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,took once a fortnight to the nearest town to sell. In the mean time I
1667,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"earned all I could, by driving the sheep of a rich neighbor of ours to"
1668,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,pasture.
1669,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1670,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"But somehow or other, we did not get along, as well as we wanted to; and"
1671,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"we always found it difficult to get the rent ready for our landlord, who"
1672,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"was cruel and bad tempered. What to do we did not know, so I had at last"
1673,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"to give up my winter's schooling, to do errands for a little money."
1674,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1675,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"Finally I bought me an organ, and with that I continued to pick up"
1676,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,something at the Fairs; and I often had a kind word from the ladies and
1677,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"gentlemen, who would listen to me and give me silver pieces. At home my"
1678,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"sister always sang with me when I practised, and we could make different"
1679,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"parts to our music. I begged her to go with me sometimes, for I knew we"
1680,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,could get more money if she would help me with her voice. But she said
1681,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"she could not leave our poor old mother, so I wandered round alone."
1682,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1683,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"In one of my journeys, I met a lad who said he was going to America, and"
1684,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"he told me if I would go too, I should make money fast, and we should"
1685,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"come home rich men. I told my sister all about this, and she thought it"
1686,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"would be a good plan, but that I should not go alone, for I was too"
1687,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,young.
1688,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1689,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"After waiting a little while, we got our sister Liesle and her husband"
1690,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"Klaus, to come and live with mother, and then we made ready to leave as"
1691,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"fast possible. As soon as we could get enough money to pay our passage,"
1692,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,with many tears we bade good-bye to all at home; and then with prayers
1693,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"to the good God, we travelled on foot through France, till we reached"
1694,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"the sea-shore. Here, we were stowed away in the great hold of the ship,"
1695,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"with many other poor companions; and sometimes we were sick, and"
1696,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"sometimes we were hungry, for we did not bring enough victuals to last"
1697,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"us all our voyage. But Gertruyd was so pleasant to the others, helping"
1698,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"the women to take care of their babies, and often singing her pretty"
1699,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"songs, that every one gave us something, and we managed to get along."
1700,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1701,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"When we reached New York we were in great trouble, for we knew nobody,"
1702,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"and had no home to go to; but the good God took care of us, and made a"
1703,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,kind lady notice us standing alone on the Battery. We told her our
1704,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"wants, and after giving us a supper and a nice bed for the night, she"
1705,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"sent us to some poor Germans, where we staid till we had learned a"
1706,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,little of the American language.
1707,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1708,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"We did very well for a while, singing together, while my sister played"
1709,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,upon the tambourine; but soon there were so many other organ players in
1710,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"the streets, that we thought we would go to some other towns near by. We"
1711,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"went all through New York, and now we are going to travel over your"
1712,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"pleasant State, and if we do well we can go home in two years. Then I"
1713,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"shall buy a farm, and a cow for our dear old mother and father, and then"
1714,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,we can all live together as happy as princes. Gertruyd can marry our
1715,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"friend Cornelius, for though he is poor, she has always liked him."
1716,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1717,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,Many good people have offered us both nice places; but I like my organ
1718,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"too well to give it up, and my sister will not leave me for never so"
1719,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"fine a home, because she promised mother to take care of me always. We"
1720,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"live on as little as possible, and dress in very poor clothes so as to"
1721,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"save all we can; for we say, no one will care how we look, if we are"
1722,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"only tidy and honest, and make trouble for nobody."
1723,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,
1724,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"The Virgin Mother, to whom we have erected a shrine in our organ, smiles"
1725,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"upon us, and will keep us from all harm, so we need fear nothing. We are"
1726,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,both well contented with little; and as long as we do not lose our
1727,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"voices, we can make several dollars a day, and so we are happy. Good-bye"
1728,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"to you, and the kind-hearted children who have been so pleasant to us,"
1729,THE GERMAN MUSICIANS.,"and that God will bless you all, is the prayer of Hendrik and his sister"

1744,MY DEAR LILY:,"As you were so kind as to remember me at Christmas, I will write you a"
1745,MY DEAR LILY:,"letter about our other yearly festival, the ""May-day Coronation."" Of"
1746,MY DEAR LILY:,"course, you remember many of our pleasant gatherings, at different rural"
1747,MY DEAR LILY:,"spots, on that occasion. But I do not think we ever had a pleasanter"
1748,MY DEAR LILY:,time than this year at May Mount; for so we christened the place where
1749,MY DEAR LILY:,we had our party.
1750,MY DEAR LILY:,
1751,MY DEAR LILY:,"Early in the morning, we voted for the Queen, and after every one had"
1752,MY DEAR LILY:,"written their choice on the big slate, we found that Annie was"
1753,MY DEAR LILY:,"unanimously elected. We were all delighted, as she had been so long"
1754,MY DEAR LILY:,"separated from us, and then she chose her maids of honor and two pages."
1755,MY DEAR LILY:,"We selected some pretty songs, and all rehearsed the pieces of poetry we"
1756,MY DEAR LILY:,intended for our Queen; then we were very busy finishing off moss
1757,MY DEAR LILY:,"baskets, and making bouquets and wreaths for the procession."
1758,MY DEAR LILY:,
1759,MY DEAR LILY:,"We had two beautiful banners, all trimmed round with evergreen; one had"
1760,MY DEAR LILY:,"on it, ""All Hail, thou lovely May;"" and the other, ""Sweet Spring has"
1761,MY DEAR LILY:,"come."" We also twined a tall May-pole with evergreen and put on the top"
1762,MY DEAR LILY:,"a great wreath of daffies. For a throne we had an armchair, and on each"
1763,MY DEAR LILY:,"side two large bouquets of flowers. These were sent us from Boston,"
1764,MY DEAR LILY:,besides three beautiful wreaths for the Queen and her maids of honor.
1765,MY DEAR LILY:,"The wild flowers were so plentiful, that we had very pretty wreaths for"
1766,MY DEAR LILY:,"all the subjects too, which we cannot say every year."
1767,MY DEAR LILY:,
1768,MY DEAR LILY:,"At two o'clock we all started, each one carrying baskets of refreshments"
1769,MY DEAR LILY:,"for the table, which was to be laid in pic-nic style. We had a great"
1770,MY DEAR LILY:,"deal of fun walking over to the place, for the wind blew quite strong,"
1771,MY DEAR LILY:,and we had as much as we could do to get all our things safely to
1772,MY DEAR LILY:,"Riverdale. After we arrived in the little wood, we chose a green mound"
1773,MY DEAR LILY:,"for the throne, and spread carpets round for fear of dampness; and then,"
1774,MY DEAR LILY:,"while the young ladies made the arrangements for the celebration, we"
1775,MY DEAR LILY:,scampered off for wild flowers.
1776,MY DEAR LILY:,
1777,MY DEAR LILY:,"The boys were just as full of fun as they could be, and one of them"
1778,MY DEAR LILY:,"caught a little snake and chased us; but we did not mind any thing, we"
1779,MY DEAR LILY:,"felt so happy ourselves. One of the girls tore her dress, and another"
1780,MY DEAR LILY:,"fell out of the swing, which one of the gentlemen kindly put up for us;"
1781,MY DEAR LILY:,but we determined to laugh at everything.
1782,MY DEAR LILY:,
1783,MY DEAR LILY:,"Soon the parents and company all assembled, and then we went through our"
1784,MY DEAR LILY:,"usual ceremonies. Our Queen looked sweetly, and the wreaths were very"
1785,MY DEAR LILY:,becoming to all the girls. Each one said a piece of poetry to her
1786,MY DEAR LILY:,"majesty, and then kissing her hand, said, ""Long live the Queen of May."""
1787,MY DEAR LILY:,"We had a bishop, who put on the crowns and made a nice little address;"
1788,MY DEAR LILY:,"and then the pages introduced all the ladies and gentlemen to the Queen,"
1789,MY DEAR LILY:,who sat smiling and blushing at her honors.
1790,MY DEAR LILY:,
1791,MY DEAR LILY:,"Then we all stood in a circle and sang our May song round the May-pole,"
1792,MY DEAR LILY:,"but the wind scattered our voices, and they did not sound so well as in"
1793,MY DEAR LILY:,"school. After that, we played games and went to the top of Prospect"
1794,MY DEAR LILY:,"Rock, from which we could see the river, the woods and all the village,"
1795,MY DEAR LILY:,"which looked very pretty with its three churches, and nice white houses."
1796,MY DEAR LILY:,
1797,MY DEAR LILY:,"After we had rambled round till we were tired, we took some refreshment"
1798,MY DEAR LILY:,"at the table, which was loaded with good things and looked very pretty."
1799,MY DEAR LILY:,"Then we repeated several of our songs, by particular request; and we did"
1800,MY DEAR LILY:,a great deal better than at first. Just before sunset we packed up all
1801,MY DEAR LILY:,"the things and prepared to go home. Some of us rode, packed eight or"
1802,MY DEAR LILY:,"nine, close in a wagon, and the rest of us walked home."
1803,MY DEAR LILY:,
1804,MY DEAR LILY:,"We stopped a moment at the old apple-tree, where the first May-party was"
1805,MY DEAR LILY:,"gathered, and some of the oldest girls gave an account of the ""Prince of"
1806,MY DEAR LILY:,"Wales,"" who was present on the occasion."
1807,MY DEAR LILY:,
1808,MY DEAR LILY:,"We had a grand time, and I hope we may have just such another every"
1809,MY DEAR LILY:,"year. I pressed my wreath as a memento of the occasion, and have put it"
1810,MY DEAR LILY:,"away to show you, when you come to make me a visit. With love to all"

2189,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.",unsurpassable magnificence.
2190,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.",
2191,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","Her name was Unda. For many, many years she had been busy doing good,"

2212,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.",The news of her coming was sent to distant parts of the country by the

2222,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","heard in every street. A procession was formed, three miles in length,"
2223,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","composed of men of all ranks, ages and professions, each bearing an"
2224,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","appropriate offering, and all vying with each other in the costliness of"

2230,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","A pretty lake, in the centre of a spacious park interspersed with green"

2238,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","heard, like the breathings of an Æolian harp. Then swelling clearer and"
2239,"UNDA, OR THE FOUNTAIN FAIRY.","louder, instantly up rose the lovely Water Spirit, radiant with gems,"
