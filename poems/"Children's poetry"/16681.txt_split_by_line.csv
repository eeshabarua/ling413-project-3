46,THE NEW BABY.,But how did the little new baby get
47,THE NEW BABY.,Down here from the depths of the sky?
48,THE NEW BABY.,"She couldn't have come alone, you know,"

50,THE NEW BABY.,
51,THE NEW BABY.,Oh! the angels carried her down in their arms
52,THE NEW BABY.,"From the far-away, beautiful blue;"
53,THE NEW BABY.,"Brought her down from the arms of God,"
54,THE NEW BABY.,A present to me and to you.
55,THE NEW BABY.,
56,THE NEW BABY.,"So, you see, we must kiss the baby,"
57,THE NEW BABY.,"And give her a lot of love,"
58,THE NEW BABY.,That she may not need the angels
59,THE NEW BABY.,Till she meets them again above.

276,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"The children are fond of a merry tune,"
277,THE ORGAN-BOY.,so they have given the organ-boy a
278,THE ORGAN-BOY.,penny to play. The babies stare at the
279,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"organ, as though they thought it a very"
280,THE ORGAN-BOY.,funny box to make such a noise. One little
281,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"child, with a doll in her arms, is giving a"
282,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"piece of bread to the monkey, but he looks"
283,THE ORGAN-BOY.,as if he suspected it was a trick. The boy
284,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"has a cloth over his organ, to protect it"
285,THE ORGAN-BOY.,when it rains. I do not like to see monkeys
286,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"led about in this way. I think it is cruel,"
287,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"and must cause them much suffering,"
288,THE ORGAN-BOY.,especially if they have a cruel master. But
289,THE ORGAN-BOY.,I think this little boy will be kind to his
290,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"little companion, and not twist and throw it"
291,THE ORGAN-BOY.,about as some of the men do. Monkeys
292,THE ORGAN-BOY.,"are very amusing, after they go through a"

294,THE ORGAN-BOY.,tricks for their master.

496,JACK.,The name of the bear is _Jack_. I fetched
497,JACK.,him from the West India Import Dock
498,JACK.,"on the 5th of November, 1870. He was running"
499,JACK.,"about with another bear on board ship,"
500,JACK.,but the job was to catch him. After many
501,JACK.,attempts we at last put a strong collar round
502,JACK.,"his neck, to which was attached a long chain,"
503,JACK.,and then we got him into a large barrel and
504,JACK.,"fastened the head on with hoop-iron, lowered"
505,JACK.,him over the side of the vessel into a
506,JACK.,"boat, and then pulled to the quay, and hauled"
507,JACK.,him up into a cart. For a time the little fellow
508,JACK.,"was quiet enough, but he got very inquisitive"
509,JACK.,when being driven towards the
510,JACK.,"city, and wanted to have a look round. I"
511,JACK.,managed to quiet him by giving him pieces
512,JACK.,of lump-sugar. He arrived safely at the Crystal
513,JACK.,"Palace, and has lived in an aviary till the"
514,JACK.,"beginning of last month, when he was put"
515,JACK.,into his new bear-pit. The little fellow has
516,JACK.,grown twice the size he was when he first
517,JACK.,"came. He is very playful, but sometimes"
518,JACK.,he shows his teeth when he is teased.

583,THE STORY OF TOPSY.,"evening that they were drowned, while the"
584,THE STORY OF TOPSY.,"cook was in her pantry, with the window"

1272,THE PERFORMING MONKEYS.,many of the monkeys that go about our

1279,THE PERFORMING MONKEYS.,at the Zoological Gardens have tolerably
1280,THE PERFORMING MONKEYS.,large cages. I wish the parrots were as
