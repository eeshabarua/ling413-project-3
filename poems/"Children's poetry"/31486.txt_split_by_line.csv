56,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Our tale is a true one, from which may be taught"
57,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","A maxim for youth, with utility fraught;--"
58,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","_If terrors assail you, examine the cause,"
59,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And all will be well_;--for, by NATURE'S kind laws,"
60,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Nor Goblins nor Spectres on earth have a station,--"
61,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",These phantoms are all of ideal creation.

64,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
65,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","A _Monkey_, that comical tricks would be at,"
66,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",His frolics one morning began with the _Cat_;
67,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","He chatter'd, as much as to say _How d' ye do?_"
68,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And _Puss_ look'd her thanks, and politely cried _Mew_!"
69,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","_Pug_ then shook her paw, and they sat down together,"
70,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","_Puss_ washing her face, indicating wet weather."
71,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
72,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
73,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
74,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","But, mischief the _Monkey_ inclining to harbour,"
75,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",His skill he resolved now to try as a _Barber_.--
76,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","A soap-box conveniently lay in the room,"
77,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""Miss _Puss_,"" he exclaim'd, ""you'll be shaved, I presume?"""
78,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Then scraping and bowing with grin and grimace,"
79,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Despite of resistance, he lather'd her face."
80,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
81,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
82,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
83,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Now _Pug_ could not find either razor or knife,"
84,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",So _Puss_ ran no hazard of losing her life;--
85,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Yet razor or knife though they could not be had,"
86,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",_Pug_ found what the terrified _Cat_ thought as bad;
87,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","A knife made of ivory, in use to cut paper,"
88,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",With which Barber _Pug_ now proceeded to scrape her.
89,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
90,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
91,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
92,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","But _Puss_ on a sudden deserted her station,"
93,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Disliking (no wonder) the strange operation,"
94,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",And ran round the room without means of escaping;
95,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","While _Pug_, still determined to give her a scraping,"
96,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Pursued, and, regardless of struggle or prayer,"
97,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Fast bound her, at last, to the back of a chair."
98,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
99,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
100,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
101,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","When, tucking a napkin close under her chin,"
102,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",Each mew of dismay he return'd with a grin;
103,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And yelling and chattering they raised such a clatter,"
104,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",That _Susan_ rush'd in to learn what was the matter;
105,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","When _Pug_, overturning the chair midst the clack,"
106,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Ran off, leaving _Pussy_ stretched out on her back."
107,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
108,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
109,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
110,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","The sight was to _Susan_ so curious, that faster"
111,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","She ran _out_ than _in_, to tell _Mistress_ and _Master_;"
112,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","But, when they came up, neither _Puss_ nor the _Shaver_"
113,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Was there, to account for improper behaviour;--"
114,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","For _Pug_ had contrived, amid _Susan's_ alarms,"
115,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","To reach the house-top, with Miss _Puss_ in his arms."
116,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
117,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
118,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
119,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Now fearing that _Pug_ or Miss _Puss_ might be maim'd,"
120,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""Go, fetch a long ladder,"" the _Master_ exclaim'd;"
121,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""And bring them down quickly both _Barber_ and _Cat_."""
122,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""Oh, oh!"" thought the _Monkey_, ""I _sha'nt suffer that_.""--"
123,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","The ladder was climb'd by a servant so valiant,"
124,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",But _Pug_ with loose tiles soon repulsed the assailant.
125,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
126,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
127,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
128,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Against all manoeuvre apparently proof,"
129,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","_Pug_ chatter'd and paced to and fro on the roof,"
130,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And fondled the _Cat_, and next, pitying her case,"
131,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",He wiped with the napkin the suds from her face;
132,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","As nurse would a child, then he held her out _so_,"
133,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",While all the spectators kept laughing below.
134,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
135,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
136,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
137,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Now seeing him thus to good humour inclined,"
138,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","They thought he might prove more pacific of mind,"
139,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",So mounted the ladder another assailer;
140,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","When _Pug_, of loose tiles now perceiving a failure,"
141,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Eluded the grasp of pursuit with a hop,"
142,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",And gained an adjacent and tall chimney-pot.
143,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
144,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
145,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
146,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",It chanced that the vent of this same chimney led
147,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Direct to a chamber, confined to his bed"
148,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Where lay an old gentleman, ill with the gout,"
149,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",_And wishing some bad fate might thence drag him out!_
150,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","_Pug_, missing his footing, 'midst vapour and fume,"
151,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",That instant with _Puss_ tumbled into the room.
152,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
153,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
154,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
155,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Grimed over with soot, they kick'd up such a rout,"
156,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And caper'd the sick man's apartment about,"
157,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And chatter'd and squall'd in a manner so hideous,"
158,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Like young imps of darkness, that, not to be tedious,"
159,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","The sufferer forgot both his gout and his prayers,"
160,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And scamper'd, pursued by these phantoms, down stairs!"
161,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
162,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
163,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
164,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","There sat in the parlour a medical man,"
165,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",And thither _pursued_ and _pursuers_ now ran;--
166,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And _Puss_ and the _Monkey_ grown fiercer and bolder,"
167,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Physician and Patient seized each by his shoulder,"
168,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Who raised such a yell, that the _chorus_ resembled"
169,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",A legion of mad-caps from Bedlam assembled!
170,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
171,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
172,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
173,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",The tumult each wonder-struck inmate alarm'd;
174,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","At length on assistance they ventured, well arm'd,"
175,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And entered the scene of dismay and despair,--"
176,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","When, lo! no invaders of quiet were there!"
177,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","But Doctor and Patient lay stretch'd on the floor,"
178,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",Not wotting of terror a forthcoming cure.
179,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
180,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
181,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
182,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","The incident soon was of mystery clear'd,--"
183,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",The owner of _Pug_ and _Grimalkin_ appear'd;--
184,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""My _Monkey_ and _Cat_ have created alarm;"
185,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","I hope,"" he observed, ""you have not taken harm:""--"
186,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Then cautiously peering the chamber about,"
187,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","He dragg'd, from the Chimney, both intruders out."
188,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
189,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
190,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
191,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Alarm now gave way to good humour and fun,--"
192,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","""Much harm to my friend,"" said the Patient, ""is done;"
193,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Your _Ape_ pill and potion has put to the rout,"
194,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And cured me, I thank him, at once of the _Gout_."""
195,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","He then to the _Monkey_ made reverence profound,"
196,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",Who _salam'd_ politely the company round.
197,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
198,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",[Illustration]
199,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",
200,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","The _Doctor_ a lesson thus learn'd, that, despite"
201,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","Of physic, the Gout may be cured by a _fright_:"
202,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","And, since this affair, now and then on the sly"
203,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.",In similar cases same means he will try.--
204,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","To show that no malice or envy he knew,"
205,"JOHN HARRIS, CORNER OF ST. PAUL'S CHURCHYARD.","He shook hands with _Pug_, and each party withdrew."
