30,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Why am I so unhappy to-day?"" said Isabella Gardner, as she opened her"
31,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"eyes on the morning of her fourteenth birth-day. ""Is it because the sun"
32,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"is not bright enough, or the flowers are not sweet enough?"" she added,"
33,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,as she looked on the glorious sunshine that lay upon the rose-bushes
34,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,surrounding her window.
35,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
36,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella arose, and dressed herself, and tried to drive away her"
37,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"uncomfortable feelings, by thinking of the pleasures of the afternoon,"
38,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,when some of her young friends were to assemble to keep her birth-day.
39,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"But she could not do it; and, sad and restless, she walked in her"
40,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"father's garden, and seated herself on a little bench beneath a shady"
41,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,tree. Everything around was pleasant; the flowers seemed to send up
42,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"their gratitude to Heaven in sweetness, and the little birds in songs of"
43,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"joy. All spoke peace and love, and Isabella could find nothing there"
44,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,like discontent or sorrow. The cause of her present troubled feelings
45,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,was to be found within.
46,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
47,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella Gardner was in the habit of indulging in a fretful and peevish
48,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"temper. She was often ""hasty in her spirit to be angry;"" forgetting that"
49,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"the wise Solomon says, ""Anger resteth in the bosom of fools;"" and that a"
50,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"greater than Solomon had commanded her to forgive, as she would be"
51,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,forgiven.
52,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
53,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Her disrespect and ill-humor toward her parents had caused her many
54,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,unhappy days and sleepless nights; and often had the day closed on
55,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"faults unrepented of, and sins unforgiven. It was but the afternoon"
56,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"before that she had spoken in a high angry tone to her eldest sister,"
57,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary, and parted in displeasure from her brother Edward, because he"
58,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,would not leave his studies to go into the garden with her. Thus had the
59,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""sun gone down upon her wrath;"" and we cannot be surprised that when it"
60,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,rose in the morning she was unhappy.
61,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
62,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella had a generous temper; and after she had been unkind or unjust,"
63,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"she was frequently sorry, and determined to be so no more; but her"
64,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,regret was forgotten as soon as she was again tempted; and at the age
65,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,of thirteen she had gained no victory over the sinful habit of indulging
66,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,in an angry temper.
67,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
68,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella had kind and indulgent parents;--parents who looked with
69,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"thankfulness upon the virtues, and with sorrow upon the faults, of their"
70,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"children, and prayed that the former might be strengthened, and the"
71,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,latter corrected. Mrs. Gardner had long seen with deep anxiety the
72,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"growing defect in Isabella's temper, and it was now brought more"
73,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"painfully home to her feelings, as she reflected how much an added year"
74,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,increased the responsibility of her child.
75,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
76,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"She had risen early, and had been long engaged in prayer to Him who can"
77,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"alone regulate the unruly dispositions, wills, and passions of sinful"
78,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"men. She prayed for knowledge of her duty to her child, and for"
79,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"strength to perform it: she prayed for Isabella, that God would convince"
80,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,her of the error of her way; that his Holy Spirit might renew her in the
81,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"spirit of her mind, that she might become a child and follower of the"
82,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Lord Jesus Christ.
83,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
84,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Long and anxiously the pious mother continued her supplications at the
85,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"throne of grace; and after taking her Bible, and reading the blessed"
86,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"assurance, ""I can do all things through Christ strengthening me,"" she"
87,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"went into the garden to meet Isabella. She found her there, sitting as"
88,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"we have described, alone and sorrowful. ""What is the matter, Isabella,"""
89,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"said Mrs. Gardner, in a kind tone: ""why are you so sad on the morning of"
90,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"your birth-day?"""
91,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
92,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,[Illustration]
93,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
94,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I don't know, mother,"" replied Isabella; ""I believe it is because"
95,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"nobody loves me."""
96,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
97,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Isabella,"" said Mrs. Gardner, ""I am afraid nobody will love you long if"
98,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"you go on as you have done lately, giving way to angry feelings whenever"
99,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"anything opposes your wishes; and, what is much worse, you will offend"
100,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"your heavenly Father, if you thus continue to break his holy commands."""
101,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
102,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I can't help being displeased, mother, when people show me that they"
103,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"don't like me, and try to vex me."""
104,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
105,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Seldom does any one vex us on purpose, Isabella. It is the bad state of"
106,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"our own hearts that makes us think we are not liked; and, besides, Jesus"
107,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Christ has forbidden us to be angry even when there are real faults. He
108,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"tells us to forgive others, as he has forgiven us; and do you think you"
109,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"have obeyed him?"""
110,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
111,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""No, mother; but people must be angry when they are treated unfairly;"
112,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,and the girls at school are often very unkind and unjust to me; and I am
113,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"sure I ought to show them that I don't like it."""
114,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
115,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Such is not the gospel rule, Isabella; and that alone should be your"
116,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"guide. There you are directed to love those who treat you unkindly, to"
117,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"do good to those that hate you, and to 'pray for those who despitefully"
118,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"use you.' The recollection of your own need of forgiveness from God,"
119,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"ought to make you patient toward the faults of others."""
120,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
121,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Very often, mother, when I try to do my best, I am misunderstood, and"
122,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"reproved; and then I am sure even the best persons would be displeased."""
123,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
124,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Not if they are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, Isabella. Was he"
125,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"not holy and undefiled, pure, spotless, and without sin? and was he not"
126,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"persecuted, falsely accused, and scourged? reviled and rejected by men,"
127,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"betrayed by one disciple, and forsaken by all the rest? Yet no word of"
128,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"evil passion was ever heard from him. He opened not his mouth, nor would"
129,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,he suffer another to resent any of the insults offered to him. 'The
130,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,disciple is not above his Master;' and if we profess to follow Jesus
131,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Christ, we must learn to bear all things, and try 'to be perfect, as our"
132,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Father in heaven is perfect.'
133,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
134,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Forgiveness of injuries is a high duty, and patiently to bear injustice"
135,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,is one of the greatest Christian excellences. God alone can give us the
136,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"right temper of mind, but we must ourselves try to attain it. Perhaps"
137,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,you may recollect what Peter says about suffering patiently for
138,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"well-doing. To be sure, those to whom he was preaching were suffering in"
139,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,a great cause; but the conquest of our faults is a great cause to us;
140,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,and we may all apply his words to our own cases. He was preaching to the
141,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Christians at Pontus, who were enduring persecution in the cause of"
142,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Christ,--'For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,"
143,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,"
144,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.'"" 1 Pet. ii, 20."
145,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
146,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella, as usual, acknowledged her error, and said she would try to"
147,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,correct it.
148,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
149,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Do you know, Isabella,"" said Mrs. Gardner, ""that you have promised me"
150,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"this a great many times before?"""
151,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
152,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Yes, mother."""
153,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
154,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""And do you know that, by thus repeatedly breaking your promises, you"
155,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"add to the sins already committed?"""
156,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
157,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Yes, mother."""
158,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
159,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""And do you know, my child, the reason why you cannot keep your"
160,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"promises?"""
161,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
162,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""No, mother; I am sure I try to keep them; but before I think I get"
163,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"angry."""
164,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
165,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""We are all weak and sinful creatures,"" said Mrs. Gardner; ""and without"
166,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,help from God we can do no good thing. Even the apostle Paul found that
167,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"when he would do good, evil was present with him: so that the best"
168,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"persons require aid from above, to enable them to keep in the right"
169,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"path. You must be convinced of your own weakness, Isabella, before you"
170,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,will feel the need of this assistance; and I should think your failures
171,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,in your efforts to regulate your temper would be enough of it.
172,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
173,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""This is the commencement of your new year. On this day you begin"
174,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,another term of duty. Think of all your faults; think particularly of
175,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"that which now troubles you so much: then go to God, and humbly confess"
176,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,to him your wickedness; seek the influence of the Holy Spirit; promise
177,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"from this day to try and govern your temper, and promise it in his"
178,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,presence. Ask God to help you to keep this resolution; pray that you may
179,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"be gentle, kind, and forgiving; humble, and willing to be reproved; and"
180,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,that the beginning of your new year may be the beginning of a new life
181,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,with you.
182,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
183,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I now leave you to think of these things, and commit you to Him who"
184,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"can alone make you perfect in every good work, with the earnest prayer"
185,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"that he may cleanse and purify your heart, and lead you into the path of"
186,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"life."""
187,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
188,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella turned to her mother, and large tears rolled down her cheeks as"
189,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"she said, ""Mother, I feel the truth of what you say; I feel that I have"
190,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"been an ungrateful child; I have neglected my duty to you, to my father,"
191,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"sister, brothers, and friends; and I now see, for the first time, how"
192,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,greatly I have been offending God. From him I will first seek
193,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"forgiveness, through the atonement of Christ, and before him I will make"
194,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"a solemn resolution to try, from this day, to subdue my sinful temper. I"
195,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"say, I will promise to try; I dare not promise to do it: I fear I shall"
196,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,fall back many times; and perhaps before this day closes I shall have
197,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to repent of angry words and wicked feelings."""
198,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
199,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"My young readers, if any of you are conscious of having the same fault"
200,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"that Isabella determined to endeavor to correct, make with her now a"
201,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"resolution to pray, and strive against it, and go to your heavenly"
202,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Father, and ask his assistance. Plead earnestly in the name of Christ"
203,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,for the gift of the Holy Spirit.
204,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
205,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mrs. Gardner heard with gratitude the determination of her child, and"
206,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,left her with an affectionate wish that her birth-day might pass
207,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,happily. When Isabella returned to her chamber she found upon her table
208,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"a large Bible. It was a birth-day gift from her parents, and beneath"
209,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella's name were written the words which stand on the title-page of
210,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"this book,--""He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he"
211,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city."" Prov. xvi, 32."
212,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
213,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella had two brothers, Edward and George: they were both younger"
214,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"than herself. Mary, her only sister, was seventeen years old, and was a"
215,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,lovely example of gentleness and piety. She was not so quick as
216,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella; but she had ""the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,"" which"
217,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,is far more beautiful in the sight of God than the most brilliant
218,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,worldly accomplishments. Her faults were controlled by Christian
219,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,principle and self-denial; and an affectionate interest in the happiness
220,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,of others marked her conduct.
221,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
222,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"On the morning of Isabella's birthday, Mary was busily employed in"
223,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"arranging fresh flowers in the little parlor, and in trying to make"
224,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,everything look pleasant for her sister. The recollection of Isabella's
225,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"unkindness to her the day before, while it grieved her kind heart, only"
226,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,made her the more anxious to add to her happiness.
227,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
228,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"This was like many other summer days. Though it opened in sunshine, it"
229,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"closed in clouds. At about twelve o'clock the bright light was darkened,"
230,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,and soon the heavy rain began to fall.
231,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
232,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""How cross Isabella will be this afternoon!"" said Edward to his sister"
233,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary. ""I am sure I don't want to see her; she will be so angry because"
234,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"it rains."""
235,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
236,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""That is a very unkind remark, Edward,"" replied Mary, ""and shows a"
237,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,wrong state of feeling. I have not heard Isabella speak an angry word
238,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to-day; and instead of wishing to be out of her way, you ought to try to"
239,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,do all that you can to make up to her for the disappointment she will
240,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"feel at not seeing her young friends."""
241,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
242,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""You are right, sister Mary,"" said Edward: ""in judging Isabella I was"
243,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,committing the same sin myself; and I thank you for correcting me. I
244,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,will try to make my sister happy; but I do hope that as she grows older
245,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"she will become more amiable, and do to others as she would have them do"
246,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to her."""
247,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
248,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,At this moment Isabella entered the room. There was no blue sky to be
249,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"seen, nor any prospect of fair weather."
250,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
251,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I am sorry that your friends will not be able to come this afternoon,"
252,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella,"" said Mary; ""but we will all try to make the evening of your"
253,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"birth-day pass pleasantly; and when our father comes home, I am sure he"
254,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"will read to us in any book you wish."""
255,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
256,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella thanked her sister, and said she thought she deserved the"
257,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,disappointment.
258,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
259,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,After tea Mr. Gardner read a very interesting book to his children. They
260,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"listened with pleasure, and had a happy evening; and when they knelt in"
261,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"family devotion, Isabella deeply felt her father's petition, that as his"
262,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"children grew in years, they might, like their divine Master, ""grow in"
263,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"favor with God and man."" She went to bed that night with a cheerful"
264,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"heart, rejoicing that she had been able to keep her resolution for one"
265,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"day. ""I give God thanks,"" said she, ""that his grace has been sufficient"
266,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"for this purpose."""
267,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
268,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,One afternoon Isabella asked her sister Mary to go with her to see their
269,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"cousins, who lived about half a mile from their father's house. Mary"
270,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"told her that she would be glad to go with her on any other day, but"
271,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"that she was engaged that afternoon, to visit her Sunday-school"
272,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"children. Mary had been a Sunday-school teacher but a short time, and"
273,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,she was deeply interested in the sacred work. Isabella had set her heart
274,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"upon going to see her cousins, and doubted not that Mary would have been"
275,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"ready to go with her. She was disappointed; and, forgetting herself,"
276,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"she told Mary that she thought she was very unkind, and that she had"
277,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"better oblige her sister, than go and see children that did not care"
278,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"anything about her. Isabella spoke angrily, and looked displeased. One"
279,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,moment after she remembered her resolution; but she was then too proud
280,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,to confess her fault.
281,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
282,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary made no reply, but soon went out upon her errand of love. The faces"
283,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,of the little children brightened with pleasure as she entered their
284,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"doors. ""Dear Miss Mary,"" said one little blue-eyed girl, ""I have learned"
285,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"my verse in the Bible every morning, as you said I must; and to-morrow I"
286,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"shall say to you seven verses out of the second chapter of Matthew,"
287,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"about the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem, of Judea."""
288,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
289,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""And I,"" said her little sister, ""have learned my hymn, about 'little"
290,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"children, love each other;' and I have tried to love brother John, and"
291,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to be kind to sister Susan, as you said was right."""
292,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
293,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Does no one but I say that you must love your brothers and sisters,"
294,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Nancy?"" said Mary."
295,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
296,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""O yes,"" said Nancy; ""our Lord Jesus Christ says so; and he says we"
297,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,cannot be his children unless we love one another. I think of that
298,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"sometimes, but sister Susan thinks of it much oftener than I do; and"
299,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"when John and I get angry in our play, or speak cross to any one at"
300,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"school, she will come, and say so sweetly, 'Little children, love each"
301,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"other.'"""
302,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
303,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary told Nancy to remember her hymn at all times, and to be early at"
304,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Sunday school the next morning, to say it to her."
305,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
306,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary found one of her scholars sick,--a little girl, named Sarah, who on"
307,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,the Sunday before was as bright and as well as any child in school. Now
308,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"her hands were burning with fever, and her large dark eyes were dim with"
309,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,disease. Once they brightened a little when Mary spoke to her of her
310,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"class, but she soon turned over her little head, and sunk into an uneasy"
311,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"sleep. Her Testament was by her bedside, and her mother said that her"
312,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"last effort, before she was taken ill, was to learn her Sunday lesson."
313,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary watched by her all the afternoon: she lifted her aching head, and"
314,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"spread under it the cool pillows: she bathed her burning temples, and"
315,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"gently fanned her; and when, she gave the medicine, she silently prayed"
316,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,that the means used for her recovery might be blessed. Sarah did not
317,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"speak, but when she opened her eyes she looked pleased that Mary was"
318,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,beside her. She remained with the little sufferer until her brother came
319,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"for her in the evening, and promised to return the next day."
320,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
321,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella had gone to her room before Mary got home. She did not like to
322,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"meet her; for the unpleasant feelings had not left her bosom, though she"
323,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,sincerely regretted her impatience. Pride now prevented her
324,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"acknowledging her fault. When alone, she took her Bible, and sat down to"
325,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"read our Saviour's sermon on the mount. As the sacred precepts, one"
326,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"after another, met her eye, she felt serious and humble. When she came"
327,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to the verse, ""If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there"
328,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave there thy
329,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"gift before the altar, and go thy way: first be reconciled to thy"
330,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"brother, and then come and offer thy gift;"" she felt that Jesus Christ"
331,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"had spoken these words directly to her. She had often read them before,"
332,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,but never until this moment had they reached her heart.
333,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
334,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""What gift have I to lay upon God's altar?"" she said to herself: ""prayer"
335,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,is my only offering; one that I am now about to present. Will God accept
336,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"it while I am angry with my sister? O no! I will go this moment to her,"
337,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"and confess my fault, and ask her forgiveness. I will first be"
338,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"reconciled, and then come and offer my gift."""
339,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
340,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"She went to Mary's room, and putting her arms around her neck, she said,"
341,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Dear sister, I cannot ask God to forgive me my trespasses this night"
342,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,until I have told you how sorry I am that I treated you so unkindly this
343,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"afternoon. You are a good, affectionate sister to me, and I am very"
344,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,ungrateful. Will you forgive me? I will try to check my impatient
345,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"feelings in future, and I hope to try in better strength than my own."""
346,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
347,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I am quite ready to forgive you,"" said Mary, affectionately: ""the"
348,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,offense to me is but a trifle; it is not that I regret. It is the sin we
349,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"commit against God, when we give way to improper feelings of any kind,"
350,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,we should mourn over. He has commanded us to be patient and forgiving;
351,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,and it makes me sad to think how often we grieve his Holy Spirit by
352,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"doing what we know is wrong."""
353,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
354,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""It is a source of daily sorrow to me,"" replied Isabella, ""that I cannot"
355,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"cultivate the temper of mind which is pleasing to God and man."""
356,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
357,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I have rejoiced lately, dear Isabella, to see you bear many little"
358,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,disappointments patiently; and until yesterday I have scarcely heard a
359,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"hasty word from you for some time. I hope you will persevere, and that"
360,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"we shall both of us grow better as we grow older."""
361,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
362,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Yes,"" said Isabella, ""I have endeavored lately to subdue my evil"
363,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"temper, which is the source of so much trouble to me, I had hoped that I"
364,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"had in some degree succeeded, for many a time when I have felt an angry"
365,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"passion rising, I have tried to lift up my heart to God, and to say,"
366,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"'Lord, give me strength to resist this temptation;' but to-day I have"
367,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"gone very far back, and how can I be forgiven for thus breaking the"
368,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"solemn resolution I made on my birth-day?"""
369,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
370,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Do not say so, Isabella. Humbly confess your fault before God: he will"
371,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"forgive you according to his promise through Christ Jesus, and encourage"
372,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,you in your renewed efforts. God seeth not as man seeth: he knows how
373,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"frail and weak we are, and he sees every penitent tear, and rejoices"
374,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,over every effort we make to overcome besetting sins. Our Lord Jesus
375,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Christ should be our example of forbearance. No angry words were ever
376,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"heard from him, and he is not willing to hear them from those who call"
377,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"themselves his followers. Let us pray, my dear sister, 'that the same"
378,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"mind may be in us that was also in Christ Jesus.'"""
379,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
380,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I hear kind instructive words from you, my dear sister, and from my"
381,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"parents, teachers, and other friends, and I hope they will not be lost"
382,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"upon me. The Bible is much dearer to me now than it once was, and I find"
383,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,there simple directions for every duty. Formerly when I read my
384,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Saviour's words, if I applied them at all, it was to somebody else"
385,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,rather than myself; but now I begin to feel that I need his blessed
386,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"counsels more than anybody."""
387,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
388,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I am thankful, Isabella, to hear you speak so of the Bible. May it be a"
389,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"lamp unto the feet and a light unto the path, of us both; then our"
390,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"footsteps will not slip, and we shall be faithful children, sisters, and"
391,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,friends. Jesus Christ came to this world to save us from the power as
392,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"well as the punishment of sin; and his gospel must purify our hearts,"
393,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"and correct our daily faults, or it will do us no good."""
394,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
395,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella listened attentively to her sister's words. She felt their
396,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"value, for she saw how faithfully Mary practiced what she taught."
397,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
398,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Good night, dear sister,"" said Isabella: ""may the humbling recollection"
399,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"of to-day's failure strengthen me in my efforts to keep my resolution."""
400,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
401,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"As week after week passed by, Isabella Gardner met new difficulties to"
402,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"oppose her resolution; but though often cast down, she gained strength"
403,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,every day.
404,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
405,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Her trials at her day-school were very great, for her school-fellows did"
406,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,not know how she was endeavoring to correct her great fault; and they
407,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"would often avoid her company in their walks and amusements, knowing how"
408,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,she formerly made them unhappy by her caprices. She bore all this
409,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"patiently, and would leave her companions immediately when anything was"
410,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,said or done that displeased her; and by going away by herself she was
411,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"prevented from making a hasty reply, and had time to reflect and gather"
412,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,strength for future trials.
413,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
414,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"It was hard for Isabella to ""cease to do evil,"" and harder still for her"
415,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to ""learn to do well;"" and it would fill a much larger book than this,"
416,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,were I to tell you of all the difficulties she met with in trying to
417,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""put on the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit."""
418,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
419,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"But God was near. He saw her efforts and her failures, and he saw that"
420,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,his correcting hand must be stretched forth to finish the good work
421,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"which he had begun. He sent sickness upon her, and the lately blooming"
422,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella was laid low upon the bed of pain. It was then she was called
423,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"upon to ""let patience have its perfect work."""
424,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
425,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,When Isabella heard her physician say that she would probably be ill for
426,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"a long time, she thought of her resolution, and feared that she would be"
427,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"unable to keep it when there was so much pain to bear, and so much"
428,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,medicine to be taken. Then the solemn thought came that death might be
429,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"very near, and that she might have but a little time left to correct her"
430,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"fault; and she determined to pray for patience, and to be particularly"
431,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,watchful over herself.
432,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
433,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I have indulged my old habit of fretfulness a good deal to-day,"
434,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"mother,"" she said, as Mrs. Gardner sat down by her side, after making"
435,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"everything ready for the night. ""I fear I shall never correct it; but I"
436,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"did not think of this sick bed when I made my resolution."""
437,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
438,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Has not God promised to be 'about your bed, and about your path,' my"
439,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"dear child?"" said Mrs. Gardner."
440,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
441,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""Yes, mother; and could I but remember his presence, I should not so"
442,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"often grieve you by my impatience."""
443,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
444,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""You must not talk any more tonight, Isabella,"" said her mother"
445,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"affectionately; ""but try to go to sleep, and remember that God is always"
446,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"near you, and that his Holy Spirit is more grieved than even your mother"
447,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"by any disobedience to his commands. I love you, and forgive you. Now go"
448,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to sleep, and may you awake refreshed in body and soul."""
449,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
450,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mary nursed her sister night and day, and never left her except when"
451,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Mrs. Gardner insisted upon her going away to rest herself. Isabella was
452,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"often impatient toward her, but Mary quietly went on treating her with"
453,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"more and more tenderness. She scarcely spoke, but humbly and silently"
454,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,went on doing everything a sister's love could suggest.
455,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
456,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I wish you would speak cross to me sometimes,"" said Isabella to her"
457,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"one day, ""and then I should not feel so sorry after I had been unkind"
458,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"to you; but you are so patient and good, that it makes me quite ashamed"
459,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"of my fretfulness."""
460,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
461,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I will do anything for you but that, Isabella,"" said Mary; ""but it is"
462,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,my constant prayer that my Saviour may grant me the temper of mind that
463,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"becometh his disciple, and that I may 'sin not with my lips' against"
464,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"him."""
465,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
466,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Isabella became rapidly worse, and the sorrowful countenance of her"
467,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"father, and the anxious tenderness of her mother, showed how dear their"
468,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,erring child was to their hearts.
469,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
470,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Edward would come home early from school to know how his sister was, and"
471,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,to see if there was anything he could do for her; and the merry voice of
472,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"little George was still, and no one heard the sound of his ball or top."
473,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
474,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"It was a house of sadness, but of composure,--a house of Christian"
475,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,sorrow! Trouble had entered it; but its inmates felt that the trouble
476,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"came from a Father's hand, and that they should have no more than He who"
477,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"knew them best, and loved them best, saw was for their good. They felt"
478,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"their Saviour's presence, and rested upon his words, ""My grace is"
479,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"sufficient for thee."""
480,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
481,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,But this sickness was not unto death: God raised Isabella from her bed
482,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,of pain to glorify him by the holy obedience of her life. To the eye of
483,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"man there was much yet to be done; but her heart was humbled, and her"
484,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"pride subdued; and He who knew all her weakness, saw that she would"
485,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"persevere, and that his chastisement had answered the purpose for which"
486,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,it had been sent.
487,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
488,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"As Isabella began to recover, the confinement to her room, and her"
489,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"extreme weakness, were rather more difficult to bear than her sickness."
490,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"She was, however, mild and very thoughtful, and she would sit sometimes"
491,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"for an hour in the easy chair, with her face covered with her hands."
492,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
493,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,One evening she asked her mother if she had seen her show a wrong spirit
494,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,during the day.
495,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
496,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I have not,"" said Mrs. Gardner."
497,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
498,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I am glad of it,"" said Isabella: ""I have been trying to be faithful to"
499,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"myself, and I rejoice that one day has passed at the close of which my"
500,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,mother can give me a smile of approbation. I have been looking back upon
501,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"this long sickness, and I fear I have not improved as I ought: I must"
502,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"begin in earnest now, relying upon divine assistance."""
503,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
504,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,It was a happy morning in Mr. Gardner's family when Isabella once more
505,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,took her usual seat at the breakfast table. She was pale and thin: the
506,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,glow of health had left her cheeks; but there was an expression there
507,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,that showed the better health of the soul. The grateful child joined the
508,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,family group at breakfast with a prayer that she might never again
509,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,disturb its harmony.
510,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
511,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,But little time had passed before her school companions found that she
512,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"was ""renewed in the spirit of her mind."" They found her ready to forgive"
513,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"those who injured her, willing to oblige others, and to be pleased"
514,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"herself. They soon began to love her much; for her bright, active mind,"
515,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,made her a delightful companion; and it was not long before Isabella
516,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Gardner was one of the most pleasing and best-esteemed girls in school.
517,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
518,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"The beautiful summer had passed, and the solemn autumn. The green fields"
519,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"had given their rich crops to the farmers, making glad their hearts with"
520,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"an abundance of good things. In short, winter had come, and was nearly"
521,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,gone.
522,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
523,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,At the close of a cold day the family of Mr. Gardner were sitting by
524,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"their comfortable fire. ""I have been thinking,"" said little George, as"
525,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"he looked into the bright fire, ""how good sister Isabella has grown"
526,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,lately. She has not spoken a cross word to me since I can remember; and
527,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"cousin Emily Gray says she would rather come to see her than anybody,"
528,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"now that she is so kind and obliging."""
529,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
530,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mr. Gardner tried, by a serious look and shake of the head, to make"
531,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,little George understand that he did not like his remarks; but George
532,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"did not see him, and went on to say that he should like to know how"
533,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,Isabella had managed to grow so good.
534,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
535,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I see your kindness, dear father,"" said Isabella, ""in wishing George to"
536,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,be silent lest he should hurt my feelings; but you need not shake your
537,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"head at him, for I am quite willing that he should say what he thinks. I"
538,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,have noticed how carefully you and mother have avoided speaking of my
539,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,faults; but I have known by your silent kindness that you have seen and
540,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,approved of my efforts to overcome them. I have done but little; but I
541,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,hope by perseverance to become more worthy to be your child.
542,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
543,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""You say, George, that I have grown better, and wonder what has made me"
544,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"so. I will tell you, my dear brother. My mother's counsels and prayers"
545,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"first directed me to the source of all strength,--to God, and his holy"
546,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"word. I had neglected her wishes, and showed disrespect to her"
547,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"authority; and in sorrow, but in much love, she committed me to the care"
548,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"of my heavenly Parent. She led me to Jesus, who was meek and lowly in"
549,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"heart. From him I have sought dayly, hourly help, and to him let all the"
550,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"praise be given, if I have succeeded at all in subduing my unruly"
551,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"temper. My long sickness, last autumn, brought me to feel my great"
552,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"weakness and entire dependence upon God, and gave me time for"
553,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,reflection. The patient kindness of my friends humbled me also; for I
554,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"felt how little I deserved it; and I resolved anew, that if my life was"
555,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"spared, I would be a better child in future. But I have much yet to do,"
556,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"and the constant effort that I am obliged to make, to conquer this one"
557,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"fault, is enough to keep me humble."""
558,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
559,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I don't quite understand all that you have said, Isabella,"" replied"
560,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"George; ""but I know it is much like what father and mother have often"
561,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"told me, that when I don't know exactly how to do right, I must go to"
562,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"God, and he will always direct me."""
563,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
564,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"""I can scarcely tell you, George, how much happier I am now than I used"
565,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,to be. I wish I could tell you and every friend I have. My disrespect to
566,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"my father and mother caused me many a bitter tear, while my unkindness"
567,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,to my brothers and sisters made my dayly life unhappy; and after my
568,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"angry disputes with my school-fellows, I was left in a troubled state of"
569,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"mind, vexed with myself and them. Now, with all my strivings and"
570,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"failures, I have much peace; and I believe every one will have it just"
571,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,in proportion as he or she obeys the commandment of the Lord Jesus
572,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Christ, 'Love one another.'"""
573,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,
574,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"Mr. Gardner embraced his child, and when again they knelt in evening"
575,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"devotion, he prayed that love to God and man might reign in the bosom of"
576,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"each of his family, that when they were called from this world of trial"
577,THE GOOD RESOLUTION.,"and temptation, they might all meet in those blessed regions where all"
