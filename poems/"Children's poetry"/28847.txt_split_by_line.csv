62,PREFACE.,"AH, how oft we read or hear of"
63,PREFACE.,Boys we almost stand in fear of!
64,PREFACE.,"For example, take these stories"
65,PREFACE.,"Of two youths, named Max and Maurice,"
66,PREFACE.,"Who, instead of early turning"
67,PREFACE.,"Their young minds to useful learning,"
68,PREFACE.,Often leered with horrid features
69,PREFACE.,At their lessons and their teachers.
70,PREFACE.,Look now at the empty head: he
71,PREFACE.,Is for mischief always ready.
72,PREFACE.,"Teasing creatures, climbing fences,"
73,PREFACE.,"Stealing apples, pears, and quinces,"
74,PREFACE.,"Is, of course, a deal more pleasant,"
75,PREFACE.,"And far easier for the present,"
76,PREFACE.,"Than to sit in schools or churches,"
77,PREFACE.,Fixed like roosters on their perches.
78,PREFACE.,"But O dear, O dear, O deary,"
79,PREFACE.,When the end comes sad and dreary!
80,PREFACE.,'Tis a dreadful thing to tell
81,PREFACE.,That on Max and Maurice fell!
82,PREFACE.,"All they did this book rehearses,"
83,PREFACE.,Both in pictures and in verses.

92,TRICK FIRST.,
93,TRICK FIRST.,TO most people who have leisure
94,TRICK FIRST.,Raising poultry gives great pleasure
95,TRICK FIRST.,"First, because the eggs they lay us"
96,TRICK FIRST.,For the care we take repay us;
97,TRICK FIRST.,"Secondly, that now and then"
98,TRICK FIRST.,We can dine on roasted hen;
99,TRICK FIRST.,"Thirdly, of the hen's and goose's"
100,TRICK FIRST.,Feathers men make various uses.
101,TRICK FIRST.,Some folks like to rest their heads
102,TRICK FIRST.,In the night on feather beds.
103,TRICK FIRST.,"One of these was Widow Tibbets,"
104,TRICK FIRST.,Whom the cut you see exhibits.
105,TRICK FIRST.,
106,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
107,TRICK FIRST.,
108,TRICK FIRST.,"Hens were hers in number three,"
109,TRICK FIRST.,And a cock of majesty.
110,TRICK FIRST.,Max and Maurice took a view;
111,TRICK FIRST.,Fell to thinking what to do.
112,TRICK FIRST.,"One, two, three! as soon as said,"
113,TRICK FIRST.,"They have sliced a loaf of bread,"
114,TRICK FIRST.,"Cut each piece again in four,"
115,TRICK FIRST.,"Each a finger thick, no more."
116,TRICK FIRST.,"These to two cross-threads they tie,"
117,TRICK FIRST.,Like a letter X they lie
118,TRICK FIRST.,"In the widow's yard, with care"
119,TRICK FIRST.,Stretched by those two rascals there.
120,TRICK FIRST.,
121,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
122,TRICK FIRST.,
123,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
124,TRICK FIRST.,
125,TRICK FIRST.,"Scarce the cock had seen the sight,"
126,TRICK FIRST.,When he up and crew with might:
127,TRICK FIRST.,Cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo;--
128,TRICK FIRST.,"Tack, tack, tack, the trio flew."
129,TRICK FIRST.,
130,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
131,TRICK FIRST.,
132,TRICK FIRST.,"Cock and hens, like fowls unfed,"
133,TRICK FIRST.,Gobbled each a piece of bread;
134,TRICK FIRST.,
135,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
136,TRICK FIRST.,
137,TRICK FIRST.,"But they found, on taking thought,"
138,TRICK FIRST.,Each of them was badly caught.
139,TRICK FIRST.,
140,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
141,TRICK FIRST.,
142,TRICK FIRST.,"Every way they pull and twitch,"
143,TRICK FIRST.,This strange cat's-cradle to unhitch;
144,TRICK FIRST.,
145,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
146,TRICK FIRST.,
147,TRICK FIRST.,"Up into the air they fly,"
148,TRICK FIRST.,"Jiminee, O Jimini!"
149,TRICK FIRST.,
150,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
151,TRICK FIRST.,
152,TRICK FIRST.,"On a tree behold them dangling,"
153,TRICK FIRST.,In the agony of strangling!
154,TRICK FIRST.,"And their necks grow long and longer,"
155,TRICK FIRST.,And their groans grow strong and stronger.
156,TRICK FIRST.,
157,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
158,TRICK FIRST.,
159,TRICK FIRST.,"Each lays quickly one egg more,"
160,TRICK FIRST.,Then they cross to th' other shore.
161,TRICK FIRST.,
162,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
163,TRICK FIRST.,
164,TRICK FIRST.,"Widow Tibbets in her chamber,"
165,TRICK FIRST.,"By these death-cries waked from slumber,"
166,TRICK FIRST.,
167,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
168,TRICK FIRST.,
169,TRICK FIRST.,Rushes out with bodeful thought:
170,TRICK FIRST.,Heavens! what sight her vision caught!
171,TRICK FIRST.,
172,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
173,TRICK FIRST.,
174,TRICK FIRST.,From her eyes the tears are streaming:
175,TRICK FIRST.,"""Oh, my cares, my toil, my dreaming!"
176,TRICK FIRST.,"Ah, life's fairest hope,"" says she,"
177,TRICK FIRST.,"""Hangs upon that apple-tree."""
178,TRICK FIRST.,
179,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
180,TRICK FIRST.,
181,TRICK FIRST.,"Heart-sick (you may well suppose),"
182,TRICK FIRST.,For the carving-knife she goes;
183,TRICK FIRST.,"Cuts the bodies from the bough,"
184,TRICK FIRST.,Hanging cold and lifeless now
185,TRICK FIRST.,"And in silence, bathed in tears,"
186,TRICK FIRST.,Through her house-door disappears.
187,TRICK FIRST.,
188,TRICK FIRST.,[Illustration]
189,TRICK FIRST.,
190,TRICK FIRST.,"This was the bad boys' first trick,"
191,TRICK FIRST.,But the second follows quick.

196,TRICK SECOND.,TRICK SECOND.
197,TRICK SECOND.,
198,TRICK SECOND.,
199,TRICK SECOND.,WHEN the worthy Widow Tibbets
200,TRICK SECOND.,(Whom the cut below exhibits)
201,TRICK SECOND.,"Had recovered, on the morrow,"
202,TRICK SECOND.,"From the dreadful shock of sorrow,"
203,TRICK SECOND.,She (as soon as grief would let her
204,TRICK SECOND.,Think) began to think 'twere better
205,TRICK SECOND.,"Just to take the dead, the dear ones"
206,TRICK SECOND.,"(Who in life were walking here once),"
207,TRICK SECOND.,And in a still noonday hour
208,TRICK SECOND.,"Them, well roasted, to devour."
209,TRICK SECOND.,"True, it did seem almost wicked,"
210,TRICK SECOND.,"When they lay so bare and naked,"
211,TRICK SECOND.,"Picked, and singed before the blaze,--"
212,TRICK SECOND.,"They that once in happier days,"
213,TRICK SECOND.,"In the yard or garden ground,"
214,TRICK SECOND.,All day long went scratching round.
215,TRICK SECOND.,"Ah! Frau Tibbets wept anew,"
216,TRICK SECOND.,"And poor Spitz was with her, too."
217,TRICK SECOND.,
218,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
219,TRICK SECOND.,
220,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
221,TRICK SECOND.,
222,TRICK SECOND.,Max and Maurice smelt the savor.
223,TRICK SECOND.,"""Climb the roof!"" cried each young shaver."
224,TRICK SECOND.,
225,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
226,TRICK SECOND.,
227,TRICK SECOND.,"Through the chimney now, with pleasure,"
228,TRICK SECOND.,"They behold the tempting treasure,"
229,TRICK SECOND.,"Headless, in the pan there, lying,"
230,TRICK SECOND.,"Hissing, browning, steaming, frying."
231,TRICK SECOND.,
232,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
233,TRICK SECOND.,
234,TRICK SECOND.,At that moment down the cellar
235,TRICK SECOND.,(Dreaming not what soon befell her)
236,TRICK SECOND.,Widow Tibbets went for sour
237,TRICK SECOND.,"Krout, which she would oft devour"
238,TRICK SECOND.,With exceeding great desire
239,TRICK SECOND.,(Warmed a little at the fire).
240,TRICK SECOND.,"Up there on the roof, meanwhile,"
241,TRICK SECOND.,They are doing things in style.
242,TRICK SECOND.,Max already with forethought
243,TRICK SECOND.,A long fishing-line has brought.
244,TRICK SECOND.,
245,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
246,TRICK SECOND.,
247,TRICK SECOND.,"Schnupdiwup! there goes, O Jeminy!"
248,TRICK SECOND.,One hen dangling up the chimney.
249,TRICK SECOND.,Schnupdiwup! a second bird!
250,TRICK SECOND.,Schnupdiwup! up comes the third!
251,TRICK SECOND.,Presto! number four they haul!
252,TRICK SECOND.,Schnupdiwup! we have them all!--
253,TRICK SECOND.,"Spitz looks on, we must allow,"
254,TRICK SECOND.,But he barks: Row-wow! Row-wow!
255,TRICK SECOND.,
256,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
257,TRICK SECOND.,
258,TRICK SECOND.,But the rogues are down instanter
259,TRICK SECOND.,"From the roof, and off they canter.--"
260,TRICK SECOND.,Ha! I guess there'll be a humming;
261,TRICK SECOND.,Here's the Widow Tibbets coming!
262,TRICK SECOND.,"Rooted stood she to the spot,"
263,TRICK SECOND.,When the pan her vision caught.
264,TRICK SECOND.,
265,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
266,TRICK SECOND.,
267,TRICK SECOND.,Gone was every blessed bird!
268,TRICK SECOND.,"""Horrid Spitz!"" was her first word."
269,TRICK SECOND.,
270,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
271,TRICK SECOND.,
272,TRICK SECOND.,"""O you Spitz, you monster, you!"
273,TRICK SECOND.,"Let me beat him black and blue!"""
274,TRICK SECOND.,
275,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
276,TRICK SECOND.,
277,TRICK SECOND.,"And the heavy ladle, thwack!"
278,TRICK SECOND.,Comes down on poor Spitz's back!
279,TRICK SECOND.,"Loud he yells with agony,"
280,TRICK SECOND.,For he feels his conscience free.
281,TRICK SECOND.,
282,TRICK SECOND.,[Illustration]
283,TRICK SECOND.,
284,TRICK SECOND.,"Max and Maurice, dinner over,"
285,TRICK SECOND.,"In a hedge, snored under cover;"
286,TRICK SECOND.,And of that great hen-feast now
287,TRICK SECOND.,Each has but a leg to show
288,TRICK SECOND.,
289,TRICK SECOND.,*       *       *       *       *
290,TRICK SECOND.,
291,TRICK SECOND.,"This was now the second trick,"
292,TRICK SECOND.,But the third will follow quick.

297,TRICK THIRD.,TRICK THIRD.
298,TRICK THIRD.,
299,TRICK THIRD.,
300,TRICK THIRD.,THROUGH the town and country round
301,TRICK THIRD.,Was one Mr. Buck renowned.
302,TRICK THIRD.,
303,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
304,TRICK THIRD.,
305,TRICK THIRD.,"Sunday coats, and week-day sack-coats,"
306,TRICK THIRD.,"Bob-tails, swallow-tails, and frock coats,"
307,TRICK THIRD.,"Gaiters, breeches, hunting-jackets;"
308,TRICK THIRD.,"Waistcoats, with commodious pockets,--"
309,TRICK THIRD.,"And other things, too long to mention,"
310,TRICK THIRD.,Claimed Mr. Tailor Buck's attention.
311,TRICK THIRD.,"Or, if any thing wanted doing"
312,TRICK THIRD.,"In the way of darning, sewing,"
313,TRICK THIRD.,"Piecing, patching,--if a button"
314,TRICK THIRD.,"Needed to be fixed or put on,--"
315,TRICK THIRD.,"Any thing of any kind,"
316,TRICK THIRD.,"Anywhere, before, behind,--"
317,TRICK THIRD.,"Master Buck could do the same,"
318,TRICK THIRD.,For it was his life's great aim.
319,TRICK THIRD.,Therefore all the population
320,TRICK THIRD.,Held him high in estimation.
321,TRICK THIRD.,Max and Maurice tried to invent
322,TRICK THIRD.,Ways to plague this worthy gent.
323,TRICK THIRD.,Right before the Sartor's dwelling
324,TRICK THIRD.,"Ran a swift stream, roaring, swelling."
325,TRICK THIRD.,
326,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
327,TRICK THIRD.,
328,TRICK THIRD.,"This swift stream a bridge did span,"
329,TRICK THIRD.,And the road across it ran.
330,TRICK THIRD.,
331,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
332,TRICK THIRD.,
333,TRICK THIRD.,Max and Maurice (naught could awe them!)
334,TRICK THIRD.,"Took a saw, when no one saw them:"
335,TRICK THIRD.,Ritze-ratze! riddle-diddle!
336,TRICK THIRD.,Sawed a gap across the middle.
337,TRICK THIRD.,"When this feat was finished well,"
338,TRICK THIRD.,Suddenly was heard a yell:
339,TRICK THIRD.,
340,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
341,TRICK THIRD.,
342,TRICK THIRD.,"""Hallo, there! Come out, you buck!"
343,TRICK THIRD.,"Tailor, Tailor, muck! muck! muck!"""
344,TRICK THIRD.,"Buck could bear all sorts of jeering,"
345,TRICK THIRD.,Jibes and jokes in silence hearing;
346,TRICK THIRD.,"But this insult roused such anger,"
347,TRICK THIRD.,Nature couldn't stand it longer.
348,TRICK THIRD.,
349,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
350,TRICK THIRD.,
351,TRICK THIRD.,"Wild with fury, up he started,"
352,TRICK THIRD.,With his yard-stick out he darted;
353,TRICK THIRD.,"For once more that frightful jeer,"
354,TRICK THIRD.,"""Muck! muck! muck!"" rang loud and clear."
355,TRICK THIRD.,
356,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
357,TRICK THIRD.,
358,TRICK THIRD.,On the bridge one leap he makes;
359,TRICK THIRD.,Crash! beneath his weight it breaks.
360,TRICK THIRD.,
361,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
362,TRICK THIRD.,
363,TRICK THIRD.,"Once more rings the cry, ""Muck! muck!"""
364,TRICK THIRD.,"_In_, headforemost, plumps poor Buck!"
365,TRICK THIRD.,"While the scared boys were skedaddling,"
366,TRICK THIRD.,Down the brook two geese came paddling.
367,TRICK THIRD.,
368,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
369,TRICK THIRD.,
370,TRICK THIRD.,"On the legs of these two geese,"
371,TRICK THIRD.,"With a death-clutch, Buck did seize;"
372,TRICK THIRD.,
373,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
374,TRICK THIRD.,
375,TRICK THIRD.,"And, with both geese _well in hand_,"
376,TRICK THIRD.,Flutters out upon dry land.
377,TRICK THIRD.,
378,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
379,TRICK THIRD.,
380,TRICK THIRD.,For the rest he did not find
381,TRICK THIRD.,Things exactly to his mind.
382,TRICK THIRD.,
383,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
384,TRICK THIRD.,
385,TRICK THIRD.,Soon it proved poor Buck had brought a
386,TRICK THIRD.,Dreadful belly-ache from the water.
387,TRICK THIRD.,
388,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
389,TRICK THIRD.,
390,TRICK THIRD.,Noble Mrs. Buck! She rises
391,TRICK THIRD.,Fully equal to the crisis;
392,TRICK THIRD.,"With a hot flat-iron, she"
393,TRICK THIRD.,Draws the cold out famously.
394,TRICK THIRD.,
395,TRICK THIRD.,[Illustration]
396,TRICK THIRD.,
397,TRICK THIRD.,"Soon 'twas in the mouths of men,"
398,TRICK THIRD.,"All through town: ""Buck's up again!"""
399,TRICK THIRD.,
400,TRICK THIRD.,*       *       *       *       *
401,TRICK THIRD.,
402,TRICK THIRD.,"This was the bad boys' third trick,"
403,TRICK THIRD.,But the fourth will follow quick.

407,TRICK THIRD.,
408,TRICK FOURTH.,TRICK FOURTH.
409,TRICK FOURTH.,
410,TRICK FOURTH.,
411,TRICK FOURTH.,AN old saw runs somewhat so:
412,TRICK FOURTH.,Man must learn while here below.--
413,TRICK FOURTH.,"Not alone the A, B, C,"
414,TRICK FOURTH.,Raises man in dignity;
415,TRICK FOURTH.,"Not alone in reading, writing,"
416,TRICK FOURTH.,Reason finds a work inviting;
417,TRICK FOURTH.,Not alone to solve the double
418,TRICK FOURTH.,Rule of Three shall man take trouble:
419,TRICK FOURTH.,But must hear with pleasure Sages
420,TRICK FOURTH.,Teach the wisdom of the ages.
421,TRICK FOURTH.,
422,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
423,TRICK FOURTH.,
424,TRICK FOURTH.,Of this wisdom an example
425,TRICK FOURTH.,To the world was Master Lämpel.
426,TRICK FOURTH.,"For this cause, to Max and Maurice"
427,TRICK FOURTH.,This man was the chief of horrors;
428,TRICK FOURTH.,For a boy who loves bad tricks
429,TRICK FOURTH.,Wisdom's friendship never seeks.
430,TRICK FOURTH.,With the clerical profession
431,TRICK FOURTH.,Smoking always was a passion;
432,TRICK FOURTH.,"And this habit without question,"
433,TRICK FOURTH.,"While it helps promote digestion,"
434,TRICK FOURTH.,Is a comfort no one can
435,TRICK FOURTH.,"Well begrudge a good old man,"
436,TRICK FOURTH.,"When the day's vexations close,"
437,TRICK FOURTH.,And he sits to seek repose.--
438,TRICK FOURTH.,"Max and Maurice, flinty-hearted,"
439,TRICK FOURTH.,On another trick have started;
440,TRICK FOURTH.,Thinking how they may attack a
441,TRICK FOURTH.,Poor old man through his tobacco.
442,TRICK FOURTH.,"Once, when Sunday morning breaking,"
443,TRICK FOURTH.,"Pious hearts to gladness waking,"
444,TRICK FOURTH.,"Poured its light where, in the temple,"
445,TRICK FOURTH.,"At his organ sate Herr Lämpel,"
446,TRICK FOURTH.,
447,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
448,TRICK FOURTH.,
449,TRICK FOURTH.,"These bad boys, for mischief ready,"
450,TRICK FOURTH.,"Stole into the good man's study,"
451,TRICK FOURTH.,Where his darling meerschaum stands.
452,TRICK FOURTH.,"This, Max holds in both his hands;"
453,TRICK FOURTH.,
454,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
455,TRICK FOURTH.,
456,TRICK FOURTH.,While young Maurice (scapegrace born!)
457,TRICK FOURTH.,"Climbs, and gets the powderhorn,"
458,TRICK FOURTH.,And with speed the wicked soul
459,TRICK FOURTH.,Pours the powder in the bowl.
460,TRICK FOURTH.,"Hush, and quick! now, right about!"
461,TRICK FOURTH.,For already church is out.
462,TRICK FOURTH.,
463,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
464,TRICK FOURTH.,
465,TRICK FOURTH.,"Lämpel closes the church-door,"
466,TRICK FOURTH.,Glad to seek his home once more;
467,TRICK FOURTH.,
468,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
469,TRICK FOURTH.,
470,TRICK FOURTH.,"All his service well got through,"
471,TRICK FOURTH.,"Takes his keys, and music too,"
472,TRICK FOURTH.,"And his way, delighted, wends"
473,TRICK FOURTH.,Homeward to his silent friends.
474,TRICK FOURTH.,Full of gratitude he there
475,TRICK FOURTH.,"Lights his pipe, and takes his chair."
476,TRICK FOURTH.,
477,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
478,TRICK FOURTH.,
479,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
480,TRICK FOURTH.,
481,TRICK FOURTH.,"""Ah!"" he says, ""no joy is found"
482,TRICK FOURTH.,"Like contentment on earth's round!"""
483,TRICK FOURTH.,
484,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
485,TRICK FOURTH.,
486,TRICK FOURTH.,"Fizz! whizz! bum! The pipe is burst,"
487,TRICK FOURTH.,Almost shattered into dust.
488,TRICK FOURTH.,"Coffee-pot and water-jug,"
489,TRICK FOURTH.,"Snuff-box, ink-stand, tumbler, mug,"
490,TRICK FOURTH.,"Table, stove, and easy-chair,"
491,TRICK FOURTH.,All are flying through the air
492,TRICK FOURTH.,"In a lightning-powder-flash,"
493,TRICK FOURTH.,With a most tremendous crash.
494,TRICK FOURTH.,
495,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
496,TRICK FOURTH.,
497,TRICK FOURTH.,"When the smoke-cloud lifts and clears,"
498,TRICK FOURTH.,Lämpel on his back appears;
499,TRICK FOURTH.,"God be praised! still breathing there,"
500,TRICK FOURTH.,Only somewhat worse for wear.
501,TRICK FOURTH.,
502,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
503,TRICK FOURTH.,
504,TRICK FOURTH.,"Nose, hands, eyebrows (once like yours),"
505,TRICK FOURTH.,Now are black as any Moor's;
506,TRICK FOURTH.,"Burned the last thin spear of hair,"
507,TRICK FOURTH.,And his pate is wholly bare.
508,TRICK FOURTH.,"Who shall now the children guide,"
509,TRICK FOURTH.,Lead their steps to wisdom's side?
510,TRICK FOURTH.,Who shall now for Master Lämpel
511,TRICK FOURTH.,Lead the service in the temple?
512,TRICK FOURTH.,"Now that his old pipe is out,"
513,TRICK FOURTH.,"Shattered, smashed, _gone up the spout_?"
514,TRICK FOURTH.,
515,TRICK FOURTH.,[Illustration]
