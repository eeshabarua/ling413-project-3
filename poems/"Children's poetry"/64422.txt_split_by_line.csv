94,A PUZZLED CAT.,
95,A PUZZLED CAT.,
96,A PUZZLED CAT.,"Teheran, the Persian cat, was dozing on a rug in the hall. Suddenly her"
97,A PUZZLED CAT.,"hair stood on end, and her tail grew large. What-ever was that thing"
98,A PUZZLED CAT.,coming down-stairs? She had opened her eyes just in time to see at the
99,A PUZZLED CAT.,"head of the long flight of stairs some strange animal, with great eyes"
100,A PUZZLED CAT.,"and long sharp teeth. To her horror, it slid quickly down stairs,"
101,A PUZZLED CAT.,directly toward her.
102,A PUZZLED CAT.,
103,A PUZZLED CAT.,It did not take her long to run from the mat and dodge the
104,A PUZZLED CAT.,"fierce-looking animal. She turned to look, and there lay the four footed"
105,A PUZZLED CAT.,"beast, just where she had lain. What could he be, and what was he doing"
106,A PUZZLED CAT.,"in that house? There he lay quietly. Could he be asleep? Pussy-like, she"
107,A PUZZLED CAT.,"crawled toward him, ready to spring if he stirred. She walked round him"
108,A PUZZLED CAT.,"with her back up. No, he wasn’t asleep. His eyes were wide open. Was he"
109,A PUZZLED CAT.,"lying in wait, ready to spring at her?"
110,A PUZZLED CAT.,
111,A PUZZLED CAT.,"Round and round him she walked. Not an ear did he raise, not a whisker"
112,A PUZZLED CAT.,"did he twitch, not an eyelid did he wink. What a curious fellow!"
113,A PUZZLED CAT.,
114,A PUZZLED CAT.,Had he died of heart disease coming down-stairs so fast? Her eyes opened
115,A PUZZLED CAT.,wider. She pricked up her ears to listen. Not a breath could she hear.
116,A PUZZLED CAT.,"Poor fellow, he must be dead."
117,A PUZZLED CAT.,
118,A PUZZLED CAT.,"She grew bolder. She played with his paws, and she pulled his tail. She"
119,A PUZZLED CAT.,"brushed by his side. How queer! No fat, no bones! She put one paw on his"
120,A PUZZLED CAT.,"back, two paws, three paws, all four paws. How flat! no heart, no"
121,A PUZZLED CAT.,"stomach, no insides at all. She sat down on him to think. What was he?"
122,A PUZZLED CAT.,
123,A PUZZLED CAT.,Many a day she thought about him; many a time she played with him; many
124,A PUZZLED CAT.,an hour she watched him. But a puzzled cat she always remained.

130,ON THE BEACH.,
131,ON THE BEACH.,
132,ON THE BEACH.,"This little girl has come with her mamma from the noisy city, Paris. She"
133,ON THE BEACH.,"has a shrimping net in her hand, and thinks she can catch shrimps."
134,ON THE BEACH.,
135,ON THE BEACH.,The fish-wife is surprised to see a little girl in such fine clothes on
136,ON THE BEACH.,the beach. The little girl is curious about the fish-wife. Do you wish
137,ON THE BEACH.,to know what they are talking about? Listen!
138,ON THE BEACH.,
139,ON THE BEACH.,“Êtes vous de Paris?”
140,ON THE BEACH.,
141,ON THE BEACH.,“Oui.”
142,ON THE BEACH.,

144,ON THE BEACH.,
145,ON THE BEACH.,“Combien y a-t-il de temps que vous êtes ici?”
146,ON THE BEACH.,
147,ON THE BEACH.,“Il n’y a que trois jours.”
148,ON THE BEACH.,
149,ON THE BEACH.,Do you understand? You do if you are studying French. They both talk
150,ON THE BEACH.,French although they are dressed so differently. The little girl is very
151,ON THE BEACH.,much interested in the funny dress of the fish-wife. The fish-wife is
152,ON THE BEACH.,very much pleased with the pretty dress of the little girl. She says
153,ON THE BEACH.,under her breath “Qu’elle est jolie!”
154,ON THE BEACH.,
155,ON THE BEACH.,"They look each other over from top to toe, and talk awhile. Then the"
156,ON THE BEACH.,fish-wife goes back to her work. The little girl pokes the shrimping-net
157,ON THE BEACH.,into the water and tries to catch the shrimps.

163,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
164,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
165,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"Dorothy was wandering about the house, wondering what to do. She strayed"
166,DOROTHY’S CALL.,into Grandma’s room. On the bureau lay Grandmas’s cap. Dorothy tried it
167,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"on, and thought she looked very like Grandma. There lay a pair of"
168,DOROTHY’S CALL.,spectacles. She tried those on too.
169,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
170,DOROTHY’S CALL.,Suddenly a scheme came into her wise little head. She went to Grandmas’s
171,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"closet, found one of her dress skirts, and put on that. Grandma was a"
172,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"short woman, and Dorothy was a pretty big girl for her age, still the"
173,DOROTHY’S CALL.,skirt was a trifle long in front. Grandma didn’t wear short sleeves and
174,DOROTHY’S CALL.,high-necked aprons. Grandma’s black shawl was just the thing to cover
175,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"them up, Dorothy thought, as she fastened it with Grandma’s big pin."
176,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
177,DOROTHY’S CALL.,[Illustration: DOROTHY.]
178,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
179,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"She walked quietly into the hall. Quietly, because she wasn’t sure that"
180,DOROTHY’S CALL.,Grandma would be pleased. She couldn’t see through the spectacles. She
181,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"clung to the bannisters, or down the whole flight of stairs she would"
182,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"have gone at one step. Shoving the glasses to the end of her nose, she"
183,DOROTHY’S CALL.,went on her way. Around the corner lived a poor old lady that Grandma
184,DOROTHY’S CALL.,sometimes called on. Dorothy walked to her door and knocked. The old
185,DOROTHY’S CALL.,lady came to the door.
186,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
187,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Good morning, Mrs. Johns!” said Dorothy."
188,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
189,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Good morning,” answered Mrs. Johns, looking at her caller curiously."
190,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Come in, wont you, and sit down? I don’t just recall you, though you do"
191,DOROTHY’S CALL.,seem familiar.”
192,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
193,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“My name is Swinton,” said Dorothy. (So it was and so was her"
194,DOROTHY’S CALL.,Grandmother's).
195,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
196,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Swinton? You must excuse me for not knowing"
197,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"you. I’m getting hard o’hearing, and my eyes aren’t as good as they were"
198,DOROTHY’S CALL.,once. And how are you?”
199,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
200,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“I have a little rheumatiz, and sometimes a ‘stick’ in my back,”"
201,DOROTHY’S CALL.,answered Dorothy.
202,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
203,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Your voice doesn’t sound natural, but perhaps it’s my ears. Does your"
204,DOROTHY’S CALL.,throat trouble you?”
205,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
206,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Oh no!” said Dorothy, growing nervous. “I guess I better be going.”"
207,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
208,DOROTHY’S CALL.,“Going! Why you’ve just come.”
209,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
210,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"But Dorothy hurried away, rather quickly for an old lady."
211,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
212,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“Well I never!” muttered Mrs. Johns. “She must be going out of her mind,"
213,DOROTHY’S CALL.,she acted so queer. The rheumatiz must be in her brain. She walked too
214,DOROTHY’S CALL.,fast to have it in her legs.”
215,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
216,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"Grandma was surprised to see Dorothy coming into the house, dressed in"
217,DOROTHY’S CALL.,her clothes. She couldn’t help smiling while Dorothy told her all about
218,DOROTHY’S CALL.,her call.
219,DOROTHY’S CALL.,
220,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"“And Grandma,” said Dorothy, “she didn’t find out that I was only"
221,DOROTHY’S CALL.,"myself, and not yourself at all!”"

227,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
228,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
229,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,Fido was the proud mother of four puppies. They were born in a clothes
230,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,basket. While they were very young they did not offer to leave their
231,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"warm bed. They snuggled close to their mother, and when she went off for"
232,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,a walk they cuddled together.
233,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
234,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,[Illustration]
235,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
236,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"They soon became venturesome, like most dogs and boys. Two were"
237,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"particularly so. They jumped over-board to go on a tour of inspection,"
238,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,the mother’s sharp eyes following.
239,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
240,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"The third, not quite so bold, just leaned over the edge of the basket."
241,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"He leaned too far, and out he tumbled, and then tried to climb back. The"
242,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"fourth was too lazy to move, and kept under cover."
243,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
244,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,[Illustration]
245,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
246,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"Dear, big, old Colonel eyed curiously these fat, faltering, four-legged"
247,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,new-comers. And the new-comers eyed him. They sat in judgment over his
248,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,tail as it lay on the ground. They never thought of its being a tail.
249,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"They only knew one kind, like theirs and their mother’s."
250,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
251,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"While they were thinking, the Colonel raised this bushy tail. It struck"
252,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"one under the jaw, making him turn a back somersault; it rolled the"
253,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"other puppy over. They were very much surprised, and waddled back to the"
254,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,basket as fast as their weak legs could carry them. The Colonel smiled.
255,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
256,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"These two dogs grew bolder as they grew older. Once, when their mother"
257,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"was away, they went on another inspecting tour, taking the most timid"
258,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,puppy with them.
259,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
260,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,They jumped up the front steps of their masters house. Seeing the front
261,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"door open, they decided to call. They did not know that the proper way"
262,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,was to ring the bell and hand in cards. They simply walked in and found
263,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,their way to the parlor. What fine curtains to roll on! What beautiful
264,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,lace to tear! What gay cords and tassels to pull! Such a lark!
265,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
266,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,That which attracted them most was a mat made of a wolf’s skin and head.
267,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"At first they were afraid, but seeing he did not injure them, they"
268,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"pulled him about at a great rate. They were having such a good time,"
269,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,they made some noise.
270,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,
271,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,"The maid surprised them, and stopped their little game by appearing with"
272,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,a whip. The puppies went out the front door faster than callers usually
273,FIDO’S PUPPIES.,go; and they never so much as said good-afternoon.

319,THE HISTORY LESSON.,
320,THE HISTORY LESSON.,Kate was trying to learn her history lesson. She thought she never could
321,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"learn the names of all the Presidents of the United States, and recite"
322,THE HISTORY LESSON.,them in their order. Her eyes would stray to the story books. Her mind
323,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"would wander to “Lady Constance,” who had her right hand cut off to save"
324,THE HISTORY LESSON.,the life of her dear husband. And to Cinderella and her lost slipper.
325,THE HISTORY LESSON.,And to the Prince who found it and married her. In fact she could think
326,THE HISTORY LESSON.,of everything except the Presidents of the United States.
327,THE HISTORY LESSON.,
328,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"While she was wasting her time, Cousin Anna came in to call."
329,THE HISTORY LESSON.,

340,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"“No, Cousin Anna. I never saw it,” said Kate."
341,THE HISTORY LESSON.,
342,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"“Oh, you must have that. It is so easy to learn. We used to learn the"
343,THE HISTORY LESSON.,English Sovereigns in rhyme. I remember so well our reciting;
344,THE HISTORY LESSON.,
345,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"‘First William, the Norman,"
346,THE HISTORY LESSON.,"Then William, his son,’"
347,THE HISTORY LESSON.,

417,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,
418,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Theresa loves her cat very much. How do I know? Theresa was hungry. She
419,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,asked for some milk. She sat down on the floor to enjoy it. Her dog sat
420,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"down beside her. Frisky, her cat, smelling the milk came and sat in"
421,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,front of her. Frisky did not move her eyes away from Theresa and her
422,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"milk. She looked and purred, and purred and looked."
423,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,
424,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Theresa began to feel uncomfortable. She knew Frisky liked milk but so
425,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,did she. She felt that Frisky was asking for some as well as she knew
426,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"how. Her eyes seemed to say to Theresa, “I’m very fond of milk and I’d"
427,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,like some of yours very much indeed.” When the milk passed Theresa’s
428,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"heart on its way to her stomach her heart said, “Frisky wants some too."
429,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Poor kittie!”
430,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,
431,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Theresa put the bowl down and told Frisky to take a taste. Frisky put
432,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,her little red tongue into the bowl and began tasting the milk. She kept
433,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,on tasting the milk. She didn’t once lift up her head and offer to let
434,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Theresa have the rest. Theresa liked her cat so much she couldn’t bear
435,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,to pull the bowl away. Frisky’s tongue went fast and so did the milk.
436,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Frisky lapped up every drop. She was only a cat and did not know she was
437,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,selfish.
438,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,
439,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,Some tears came into Theresa’s eyes when she saw that the milk was all
440,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"gone. She did not scold nor complain. Frisky purred, “Thank you.”"
441,THE PROOF OF LOVE.,"Theresa took her in her arms and said, “Nice Frisky!”"

494,THE ORPHANS.,"Olive was walking in the yard, when she heard a voice calling her to"

496,THE ORPHANS.,"in the parlor. This lady spoke to Olive very kindly, asking her if she"
497,THE ORPHANS.,"would like to go to live with her. Olive, liking the lady’s face and"
498,THE ORPHANS.,"manner, said she would."
499,THE ORPHANS.,
500,THE ORPHANS.,Olive had lived in this Orphan Asylum several years. She was a very
501,THE ORPHANS.,"sad-looking child, and no one had wished before to adopt her. This lady"
502,THE ORPHANS.,"wished to make some poor child happy, and chose Olive because she seemed"
503,THE ORPHANS.,"so forlorn. Promising to come for her in a few days, she kissed Olive"

505,THE ORPHANS.,
506,THE ORPHANS.,[Illustration]
507,THE ORPHANS.,
508,THE ORPHANS.,"Martin was Olive’s brother, and lived in the Asylum too. Their mother"

511,THE ORPHANS.,very well. She grew weaker and weaker. She used to go off by herself to

519,THE ORPHANS.,"had to go to a hospital, where he died. That left Martin and Olive"
520,THE ORPHANS.,"without father or mother, or anybody in the wide world to love them."
521,THE ORPHANS.,
522,THE ORPHANS.,"When Olive told Martin she was going away with a sweet lady, he threw up"
523,THE ORPHANS.,his arms and rushed down the garden quite wild-like. Martin was old
524,THE ORPHANS.,"enough to realize that his little sister was to be taken away from him,"
525,THE ORPHANS.,and he could never be with her any more. It nearly broke his heart even
526,THE ORPHANS.,to think about it.
527,THE ORPHANS.,
528,THE ORPHANS.,"Olive began to think too. They cried and they thought, they planned and"
529,THE ORPHANS.,"they talked. Olive told the matron she couldn’t leave Martin, but the"
530,THE ORPHANS.,"matron said she must. When the lady came for her, Olive cried very hard,"
531,THE ORPHANS.,"and asked if she please couldn’t take Martin too, for he wouldn’t have"
532,THE ORPHANS.,any little sister at all if she went away.
533,THE ORPHANS.,
534,THE ORPHANS.,Martin came to say good-bye. He and Olive clung to each other. While
535,THE ORPHANS.,"they sobbed, the matron scolded and the lady pondered. Finally the lady"
536,THE ORPHANS.,asked the matron’s permission to take Martin for a few days’ visit. That
537,THE ORPHANS.,"stopped the crying and the scolding, and away the children went in great"

539,THE ORPHANS.,
540,THE ORPHANS.,"Martin was such a quiet, good boy, and so happy to be with them, that"

806,THE TIDE.,
807,THE TIDE.,Mildred came over to spend an afternoon with Gertie. Gertie led Mildred
808,THE TIDE.,"to her favorite spot. It was out on the rocks, away out to the very last"
809,THE TIDE.,one that could be seen above the water.
810,THE TIDE.,
811,THE TIDE.,[Illustration]
812,THE TIDE.,
813,THE TIDE.,Gertie took off her shoes and stockings. Mildred felt too much dressed
814,THE TIDE.,"up to do that. They sat on the rock, Gertie dangling her feet in the"
815,THE TIDE.,"water. They talked, and they laughed, and they sang:"
816,THE TIDE.,
817,THE TIDE.,"“Little fishes in the water,"
818,THE TIDE.,Who has taught you how to swim?
819,THE TIDE.,Has your mother or your father

826,THE TIDE.,
827,THE TIDE.,Suddenly Gertie looked toward the shore. The tide was coming in. Already
828,THE TIDE.,some of the stepping stones were covered with water. Her stockings and
829,THE TIDE.,shoes were gradually being carried away.
830,THE TIDE.,
831,THE TIDE.,Mildred was frightened. Gertie looked very brave but wasn’t so calm as
832,THE TIDE.,she looked. She picked up her soaked shoes and stockings. They started
833,THE TIDE.,for the beach. They ran and they jumped. Mildred wasn’t sure footed. She
834,THE TIDE.,slipped and she slopped. Her shoes were soon wet.
835,THE TIDE.,
836,THE TIDE.,"The water rose higher and higher. No use in jumping, for the rocks and"
837,THE TIDE.,stones were now covered. Poor Mildred had to wade through the water with
838,THE TIDE.,her new shoes and stockings on her feet. But her shoes were not any
839,THE TIDE.,wetter than Gertie’s were in her hand. Mildred’s pretty dress was badly
840,THE TIDE.,"wet, too."
841,THE TIDE.,
842,THE TIDE.,Gertie took her visitor to her room to get her clothes dry. She felt
843,THE TIDE.,ashamed to think she had forgotten about the tide. She was sorry she had
844,THE TIDE.,by her thoughtlessness marred the pleasure of Mildred’s visit.

922,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"boy, named Peter. That was to be his name when he grew up, but now"
923,THE STOLEN CHILD.,nobody called him anything but Pete.
924,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
925,THE STOLEN CHILD.,Pete had had a bad fall when a little baby and it left him with a weak
926,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"back, so that he could not run and romp like the rest of the small boys."
927,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"He had toys to play with, but they were not nice or new, and he soon"
928,THE STOLEN CHILD.,tired of them. What he wanted most was a doll. Really? Yes. He was
929,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"ashamed to let the boys know it for fear they would call him “Sissy,”"
930,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"but deep down in his heart there was a strong desire for a doll to hug,"
931,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"and to hold, and to take to bed with him."
932,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
933,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"One day a lady came to the house, and somehow she guessed just what kind"
934,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"of a boy Pete was. Without saying a word, she took a small shawl off a"
935,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"hook, gave it a fold and a roll, pinned it together and then handed it"
936,THE STOLEN CHILD.,over to the small boy.

941,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"smile that tried to get there, and finally had to break itself all up"
942,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"into little bits. Oh, how he hugged and loved that doll! and he soon got"
943,THE STOLEN CHILD.,so he did not mind being seen on the street with it in his arms. There
944,THE STOLEN CHILD.,was no danger of breaking it; and it could sit down bea—u—ti—fully.
945,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
946,THE STOLEN CHILD.,One day Pete thought he would try to climb a lamp-post. He had seen the
947,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"other boys do it, and it looked easy, but he would need two hands. So"
948,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"the doll—Matilda Jane—had to sit down on a stoop near by, and wait until"
949,THE STOLEN CHILD.,Pete came back for her.
950,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
951,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"Well, it was not long; but when Pete got back to the place where Matilda"

954,THE STOLEN CHILD.,She was go——o——o——ne! Somebody had stolen her!
955,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
956,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"Pete was heart-broken. He cried, and cried, and cried. He should never"
957,THE STOLEN CHILD.,see his own dear Matilda Jane again! And the worst of it was that he
958,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"wouldn’t know her if he saw her. Even his mother laughed, and said “Oh,"
959,THE STOLEN CHILD.,it was only an old shawl. No great loss!”
960,THE STOLEN CHILD.,
961,THE STOLEN CHILD.,But Pete’s heart was wrapped up in that shawl and that is what makes
962,THE STOLEN CHILD.,"this a sad story. He might have other dolls, but none that would take"

1635,“UNEARTHED.”,it about.

2817,THE CORK BOAT.,
2818,THE CORK BOAT.,A life-boat is so called because it is useful in saving life. When a

2829,THE CORK BOAT.,"air-tight tubes; this is done to make it buoyant, that is, able to keep"
2830,THE CORK BOAT.,bounding along the stormy sea instead of sinking to the bottom. For cork
2831,THE CORK BOAT.,"will not sink. Stick a sail to it, and blow as Charlie has done, but you"
