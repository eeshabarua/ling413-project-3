238,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?
239,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,’Tis a marvel of great renown!
240,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop sea
241,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;
242,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet
243,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,(As those who have tasted it say)
244,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,That good little children have only to eat
245,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,Of that fruit to be happy next day.
246,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,
247,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"When you’ve got to the tree, you would have a hard time"
248,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,To capture the fruit which I sing;
249,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,The tree is so tall that no person could climb
250,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!
251,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,"
252,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And a gingerbread dog prowls below--
253,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And this is the way you contrive to get at
254,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,Those sugar-plums tempting you so:
255,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,
256,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,You say but the word to that gingerbread dog
257,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And he barks with such terrible zest
258,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,"
259,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,As her swelling proportions attest.
260,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around
261,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"From this leafy limb unto that,"
262,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground--"
263,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,Hurrah for that chocolate cat!
264,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,
265,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"There are marshmallows, gumdrops, and peppermint canes,"
266,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"With stripings of scarlet or gold,"
267,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And you carry away of the treasure that rains
268,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,As much as your apron can hold!
269,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"So come, little child, cuddle closer to me"
270,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,"In your dainty white nightcap and gown,"
271,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,And I’ll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree
272,THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE,In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.

284,KRINKEN,"Calling, “Sun-child, come to me;"

286,KRINKEN,But the child heard not the sea.
287,KRINKEN,
288,KRINKEN,Krinken on the beach one day
289,KRINKEN,Saw a maiden Nis at play;
290,KRINKEN,"Fair, and very fair, was she,"

292,KRINKEN,"“Krinken,” said the maiden Nis,"

302,KRINKEN,
303,KRINKEN,But the sea calls out no more;
304,KRINKEN,"It is winter on the shore,--"
305,KRINKEN,Winter where that little child
306,KRINKEN,Made sweet summer when he smiled:
307,KRINKEN,Though ’tis summer on the sea
308,KRINKEN,"Where with maiden Nis went he,--"
309,KRINKEN,"Summer, summer evermore,--"
310,KRINKEN,"It is winter on the shore,"
311,KRINKEN,"Winter, winter evermore."
312,KRINKEN,
313,KRINKEN,Of the summer on the deep
314,KRINKEN,Come sweet visions in my sleep;
315,KRINKEN,"_His_ fair face lifts from the sea,"
316,KRINKEN,"_His_ dear voice calls out to me,--"
317,KRINKEN,These my dreams of summer be.
318,KRINKEN,
319,KRINKEN,"Krinken was a little child,"
320,KRINKEN,By the maiden Nis beguiled;
321,KRINKEN,Oft the hoary sea and grim
322,KRINKEN,"Reached its longing arms to him,"
323,KRINKEN,"Crying, “Sun-child, come to me;"
324,KRINKEN,Let me warm my heart with thee!”
325,KRINKEN,But the sea calls out no more;
326,KRINKEN,"It is winter on the shore,--"
327,KRINKEN,"Winter, cold and dark and wild;"
328,KRINKEN,"Krinken was a little child,--"
329,KRINKEN,It was summer when he smiled;
330,KRINKEN,"Down he went into the sea,"

342,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"I dress her up and curl her hair,"
343,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,And feed her taffy candy.

345,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"Of her devoted mother,"
346,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"She will not wed her mother’s choice,"

361,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,A spinster doll forever!

363,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,I am convinced are hollow;
364,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"When once distressing times should come,"

366,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,
367,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,Yet all in vain the Dresden boy
368,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,From yonder mantel woos her;
369,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"A mania for that vulgar toy,"

371,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"In vain I wheel her to and fro,"
372,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"And reason with her mildly,--"
373,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"Her waxen tears in torrents flow,"
374,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,Her sawdust heart beats wildly.
375,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,
376,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"I’m sure that when I’m big and tall,"
377,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,"And wear long trailing dresses,"
378,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,I sha’n’t encourage beaux at all
379,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,Till mama acquiesces;
380,THE NAUGHTY DOLL,Our choice will be a suitor then

467,INTRY-MINTRY,"Willie and Bess, Georgie and May,"
468,INTRY-MINTRY,And joy of summer--where are they?
469,INTRY-MINTRY,The grim old man still standeth near
470,INTRY-MINTRY,Crooning the song of a far-off year;
471,INTRY-MINTRY,"And into the winter I come alone,"
472,INTRY-MINTRY,"Cheered by that mournful requiem,"
473,INTRY-MINTRY,Soothed by the dolorous monotone
474,INTRY-MINTRY,That shall count me off as it counted them--
475,INTRY-MINTRY,The solemn voice of old Father Time
476,INTRY-MINTRY,Chanting the homely nursery rime
477,INTRY-MINTRY,He learned of the children a summer morn
478,INTRY-MINTRY,"When, with “apple-seed and apple-thorn,”"
479,INTRY-MINTRY,Life was full of the dulcet cheer
480,INTRY-MINTRY,That bringeth the grace of heaven anear--
481,INTRY-MINTRY,The sound of the little ones hard at play--

490,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,All day long they come and go--
491,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Pittypat and Tippytoe;
492,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Footprints up and down the hall,"
493,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Playthings scattered on the floor,"
494,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Finger-marks along the wall,"
495,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Tell-tale smudges on the door--
496,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,By these presents you shall know
497,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Pittypat and Tippytoe.
498,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
499,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,How they riot at their play!
500,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,And a dozen times a day
501,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"In they troop, demanding bread--"
502,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Only buttered bread will do,"
503,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,And that butter must be spread
504,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Inches thick with sugar too!
505,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"And I never can say “No,"
506,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Pittypat and Tippytoe!”
507,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
508,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Sometimes there are griefs to soothe,"
509,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth;
510,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,For (I much regret to say)
511,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Tippytoe and Pittypat
512,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Sometimes interrupt their play
513,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,With an internecine spat;
514,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Fie, for shame! to quarrel so--"
515,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Pittypat and Tippytoe!
516,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
517,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Oh the thousand worrying things
518,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Every day recurrent brings!
519,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Hands to scrub and hair to brush,"
520,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Search for playthings gone amiss,"
521,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Many a wee complaint to hush,"
522,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Many a little bump to kiss;
523,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Life seems one vain, fleeting show"
524,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,To Pittypat and Tippytoe!
525,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
526,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"And when day is at an end,"
527,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,There are little duds to mend:
528,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Little frocks are strangely torn,"
529,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Little shoes great holes reveal,"
530,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Little hose, but one day worn,"
531,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Rudely yawn at toe and heel!
532,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Who but _you_ could work such woe,"
533,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Pittypat and Tippytoe?
534,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
535,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,But when comes this thought to me:
536,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"“Some there are that childless be,”"
537,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Stealing to their little beds,"
538,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"With a love I cannot speak,"
539,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Tenderly I stroke their heads--
540,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,Fondly kiss each velvet cheek.
541,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,God help those who do not know
542,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,A Pittypat or Tippytoe!
543,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,
544,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"On the floor and down the hall,"
545,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Rudely smutched upon the wall,"
546,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,There are proofs in every kind
547,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Of the havoc they have wrought,"
548,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,And upon my heart you’d find
549,PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE,"Just such trade-marks, if you sought;"

600,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And with what pleasure I recall
601,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"How, years ago, one gloomy fall,"
602,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,I took a tedious railway line
603,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And journeyed by slow stages down
604,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Unto that sleepy seaport town
605,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"(Albeit one worth seeing),"
606,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Where Hildegarde, John, Henry, Fred,"
607,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And Beatrix and Gwendolen
608,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And she that was the baby then--
609,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"These famous seven, as aforesaid,"
610,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Lived, moved, and had their being."
611,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,
612,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,The Hawthorne children gave me such
613,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"A welcome by the sea,"
614,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"That the eight of us were soon in touch,"
615,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"And though their mother marveled much,"
616,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Happy as larks were we!
617,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Egad I was a boy again
618,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"With Henry, John, and Gwendolen!"
619,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"And, oh! the funny capers"
620,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,I cut with Hildegarde and Fred!
621,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"The pranks we heedless children played,"
622,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"The deafening, awful noise we made--"
623,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"’Twould shock my family, if they read"
624,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,About it in the papers!
625,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,
626,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,The Hawthorne children all were smart;
627,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"The girls, as I recall,"
628,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Had comprehended every art
629,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Appealing to the head and heart,"
630,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"The boys were gifted, all;"
631,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,’Twas Hildegarde who showed me how
632,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,To hitch the horse and milk a cow
633,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And cook the best of suppers;
634,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,With Beatrix upon the sands
635,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"I sprinted daily, and was beat,"
636,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,While Henry stumped me to the feat
637,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Of walking round upon my hands
638,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Instead of on my “uppers.”
639,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,
640,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,The Hawthorne children liked me best
641,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Of evenings, after tea;"
642,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"For then, by general request,"
643,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,I spun them yarns about the west--
644,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And _all_ involving Me!
645,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,I represented how I’d slain
646,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"The bison on the gore-smeared plain,"
647,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And divers tales of wonder
648,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,I told of how I’d fought and bled
649,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"In Injun scrimmages galore,"
650,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Till Mrs. Hawthorne quoth “No more!”
651,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And packed her darlings off to bed
652,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,To dream of blood and thunder!
653,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,
654,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,They must have changed a deal since then:
655,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,The misses tall and fair
656,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"And those three lusty, handsome men,"
657,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Would they be girls and boys again
658,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Were I to happen there,"
659,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Down in that spot beside the sea
660,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,Where we made such tumultuous glee
661,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,In dull autumnal weather?
662,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,"Ah me! the years go swiftly by,"
663,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,And yet how fondly I recall
664,THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN,The week when we were children all--

679,LITTLE BLUE PIGEON,Away out yonder I see a star--

684,LITTLE BLUE PIGEON,In through the window a moonbeam comes--
685,LITTLE BLUE PIGEON,Little gold moonbeam with misty wings;

689,LITTLE BLUE PIGEON,Up from the sea there floats the sob
690,LITTLE BLUE PIGEON,"Of the waves that are breaking upon the shore,"

710,THE LYTTEL BOY,His weary moder cried;
711,THE LYTTEL BOY,But with a frown he catcht her gown
712,THE LYTTEL BOY,And hong untill her side.
713,THE LYTTEL BOY,
714,THE LYTTEL BOY,"That boy did love his moder well,"
715,THE LYTTEL BOY,"Which spake him faire, I ween;"
716,THE LYTTEL BOY,He loved to stand and hold her hand

726,THE LYTTEL BOY,They cluster at his knees;
727,THE LYTTEL BOY,"And some time, when he looked on earth"
728,THE LYTTEL BOY,"And watched the bairns at play,"

730,THE LYTTEL BOY,Ben allwais in the way.

749,TEENY-WEENY,"And, astride my willing knee,"
750,TEENY-WEENY,Plies his lash and rides away;
751,TEENY-WEENY,"Though that palfrey, all too spare,"
752,TEENY-WEENY,"Finds his burden hard to bear,"
753,TEENY-WEENY,Teeny-Weeny doesn’t care;
754,TEENY-WEENY,"He commands, and I obey!"
755,TEENY-WEENY,
756,TEENY-WEENY,"First it’s trot, and gallop then;"
757,TEENY-WEENY,Now it’s back to trot again;
758,TEENY-WEENY,Teeny-Weeny likes it when
759,TEENY-WEENY,He is riding fierce and fast.
760,TEENY-WEENY,Then his dark eyes brighter grow
761,TEENY-WEENY,And his cheeks are all aglow:
762,TEENY-WEENY,"“More!” he cries, and never “Whoa!”"
763,TEENY-WEENY,Till the horse breaks down at last.
764,TEENY-WEENY,
765,TEENY-WEENY,"Oh, the strange and lovely sights"
766,TEENY-WEENY,"Teeny-Weeny sees of nights,"
767,TEENY-WEENY,As he makes those famous flights
768,TEENY-WEENY,On that wondrous horse of his!
769,TEENY-WEENY,"Oftentimes before he knows,"
770,TEENY-WEENY,"Wearylike his eyelids close,"
771,TEENY-WEENY,"And, still smiling, off he goes"
772,TEENY-WEENY,Where the land of By-low is.
773,TEENY-WEENY,
774,TEENY-WEENY,There he sees the folk of fay
775,TEENY-WEENY,"Hard at ring-a-rosie play,"
776,TEENY-WEENY,And he hears those fairies say:
777,TEENY-WEENY,"“Come, let’s chase him to and fro!”"
778,TEENY-WEENY,"But, with a defiant shout,"
779,TEENY-WEENY,Teeny puts that host to rout;
780,TEENY-WEENY,"Of this tale I make no doubt,"
781,TEENY-WEENY,Every night he tells it so.
782,TEENY-WEENY,
783,TEENY-WEENY,So I feel a tender pride
784,TEENY-WEENY,In my boy who dares to ride
785,TEENY-WEENY,"That fierce horse of his astride,"
786,TEENY-WEENY,Off into those misty lands;
787,TEENY-WEENY,"And as on my breast he lies,"
788,TEENY-WEENY,"Dreaming in that wondrous wise,"
789,TEENY-WEENY,"I caress his folded eyes,"
790,TEENY-WEENY,Pat his little dimpled hands.
791,TEENY-WEENY,
792,TEENY-WEENY,"On a time he went away,"
793,TEENY-WEENY,"Just a little while to stay,"
794,TEENY-WEENY,And I’m not ashamed to say
795,TEENY-WEENY,I was very lonely then;
796,TEENY-WEENY,"Life without him was so sad,"
797,TEENY-WEENY,You can fancy I was glad
798,TEENY-WEENY,And made merry when I had
799,TEENY-WEENY,Teeny-Weeny back again!
800,TEENY-WEENY,
801,TEENY-WEENY,"So of evenings, after tea,"
802,TEENY-WEENY,When he toddles up to me
803,TEENY-WEENY,And goes tugging at my knee.
804,TEENY-WEENY,You should hear his palfrey neigh!
805,TEENY-WEENY,"You should see him prance and shy,"
806,TEENY-WEENY,"When, with an exulting cry,"
807,TEENY-WEENY,"Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high,"
808,TEENY-WEENY,Plies his lash and rides away!

931,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
932,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
933,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"As I am sitting in the sun upon the porch to-day,"
934,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,I look with wonder at the elm that stands across the way;
935,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"I say and mean “with wonder,” for now it seems to me"
936,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,That elm is not as tall as years ago it used to be!
937,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,The old fire-hangbird’s built her nest therein for many springs--
938,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"High up amid the sportive winds the curious cradle swings,"
939,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,But not so high as when a little boy I did my best
940,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,To scale that elm and carry off the old fire-hangbird’s nest!
941,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
942,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,The Hubbard boys had tried in vain to reach the homely prize
943,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"That dangled from that upper outer twig in taunting wise,"
944,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"And once, when Deacon Turner’s boy had almost grasped the limb,"
945,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,He fell! and had to have a doctor operate on him!
946,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Philetus Baker broke his leg and Orrin Root his arm--
947,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,But what of that? The danger gave the sport a special charm!
948,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"The Bixby and the Cutler boys, the Newtons and the rest"
949,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Ran every risk to carry off the old fire-hang-bird’s nest!
950,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
951,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"I can remember that I used to knee my trousers through,"
952,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"That mother used to wonder how my legs got black and blue,"
953,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,And how she used to talk to me and make stern threats when she
954,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Discovered that my hobby was the nest in yonder tree;
955,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"How, as she patched my trousers or greased my purple legs,"
956,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"She told me ’twould be wicked to destroy a hangbird’s eggs,"
957,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,And then she’d call on father and on gran’pa to attest
958,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"That they, as boys, had never robbed an old fire-hangbird’s nest!"
959,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
960,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"Yet all those years I coveted the trophy flaunting there,"
961,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"While, as it were in mockery of my abject despair,"
962,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"The old fire-hangbird confidently used to come and go,"
963,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,As if she were indifferent to the bandit horde below!
964,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,And sometimes clinging to her nest we thought we heard her chide
965,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,The callow brood whose cries betrayed the fear that reigned inside:
966,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"“Hush, little dears! all profitless shall be their wicked quest--"
967,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,I knew my business when I built the old fire-hangbird’s nest!”
968,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
969,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"For many, very many years that mother-bird has come"
970,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,To rear her pretty little brood within that cozy home.
971,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,She is the selfsame bird of old--I’m certain it is she--
972,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Although the chances are that she has quite forgotten me.
973,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"Just as of old that prudent, crafty bird of compound name"
974,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,(And in parenthesis I’ll say her nest is still the same);
975,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"Just as of old the passion, too, that fires the youthful breast"
976,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,To climb unto and comprehend the old fire-hangbird’s nest!
977,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
978,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"I like to see my old-time friend swing in that ancient tree,"
979,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"And, if the elm’s as tall and sturdy as it _used_ to be,"
980,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"I’m sure that many a year that nest shall in the breezes blow,"
981,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,For boys aren’t what they used to be a forty years ago!
982,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,The elm looks shorter than it did when brother Rufe and I
983,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Beheld with envious hearts that trophy flaunted from on high;
984,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,He writes that in the city where he’s living ’way out West
985,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,His little boys have never seen an old fire-hangbird’s nest!
986,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,
987,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Poor little chaps! how lonesomelike their city life must be--
988,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,I wish they’d come and live awhile in this old house with me!
989,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,They’d have the honest friends and healthful sports I used to know
990,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,When brother Rufe and I were boys a forty years ago.
991,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,"So, when they grew from romping lads to busy, useful men,"
992,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,They could recall with proper pride their country life again;
993,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,And of those recollections of their youth I’m sure the best
994,THE FIRE-HANGBIRD’S NEST,Would be of how they sought in vain the old fire-hangbird’s nest!

1017,"BUTTERCUP, POPPY, FORGET-ME-NOT",Playing and dreaming--and that was all

1045,"WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD","“Where are you going, and what do you wish?”"
1046,"WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD",The old moon asked the three.
1047,"WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD",“We have come to fish for the herring fish
1048,"WYNKEN, BLYNKEN, AND NOD",That live in this beautiful sea;

1327,LONG AGO,"And nested in our orchard trees,"
1328,LONG AGO,For every flower I had a name--
1329,LONG AGO,"My friends were woodchucks, toads, and bees;"
1330,LONG AGO,I knew where thrived in yonder glen
1331,LONG AGO,What plants would soothe a stone-bruised toe--
1332,LONG AGO,"Oh, I was very learned then,"
1333,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago.
1334,LONG AGO,
1335,LONG AGO,I knew the spot upon the hill
1336,LONG AGO,"Where checkerberries could be found,"
1337,LONG AGO,I knew the rushes near the mill
1338,LONG AGO,Where pickerel lay that weighed a pound!
1339,LONG AGO,I knew the wood--the very tree
1340,LONG AGO,"Where lived the poaching, saucy crow,"
1341,LONG AGO,And all the woods and crows knew me--
1342,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago.
1343,LONG AGO,
1344,LONG AGO,"And pining for the joys of youth,"
1345,LONG AGO,I tread the old familiar spot
1346,LONG AGO,Only to learn this solemn truth:
1347,LONG AGO,"I have forgotten, am forgot."
1348,LONG AGO,Yet here’s this youngster at my knee
1349,LONG AGO,Knows all the things I used to know;
1350,LONG AGO,To think I once was wise as he!--

1685,FATHER’S LETTER,I’m going to write a letter to our oldest boy who went
1686,FATHER’S LETTER,Out West last spring to practise law and run for president;
1687,FATHER’S LETTER,"I’ll tell him all the gossip I guess he’d like to hear,"
1688,FATHER’S LETTER,For he hasn’t seen the home-folks for going on a year!
1689,FATHER’S LETTER,"Most generally it’s Marthy does the writing, but as she"
1690,FATHER’S LETTER,"Is suffering with a felon, why, the job devolves on me--"
1691,FATHER’S LETTER,"So, when the supper things are done and put away to-night,"
1692,FATHER’S LETTER,I’ll draw my boots and shed my coat and settle down to write.
1693,FATHER’S LETTER,
1694,FATHER’S LETTER,"I’ll tell him crops are looking up, with prospects big for corn,"
1695,FATHER’S LETTER,"That, fooling with the barnyard gate, the off-ox hurt his horn;"
1696,FATHER’S LETTER,That the Templar lodge is doing well--Tim Bennett joined last week
1697,FATHER’S LETTER,When the prohibition candidate for Congress came to speak;
1698,FATHER’S LETTER,"That the old gray woodchuck’s living still down in the pasture-lot,"
1699,FATHER’S LETTER,"A-wondering what’s become of little William, like as not!"
1700,FATHER’S LETTER,"Oh, yes, there’s lots of pleasant things and no bad news to tell,"
1701,FATHER’S LETTER,"Except that old Bill Graves was sick, but now he’s up and well."
1702,FATHER’S LETTER,
1703,FATHER’S LETTER,"Cy Cooper says--(but I’ll not pass my word that it is so,"
1704,FATHER’S LETTER,"For Cy he is some punkins on spinning yarns, you know)--"
1705,FATHER’S LETTER,"He says that, since the freshet, the pickerel are so thick"
1706,FATHER’S LETTER,In Baker’s pond you can wade in and kill ’em with a stick!
1707,FATHER’S LETTER,"The Hubbard girls are teaching school, and Widow Cutler’s Bill"
1708,FATHER’S LETTER,Has taken Eli Baxter’s place in Luther Eastman’s mill;
1709,FATHER’S LETTER,"Old Deacon Skinner’s dog licked Deacon Howard’s dog last week,"
1710,FATHER’S LETTER,And now there are two lambkins in one flock that will not speak.
1711,FATHER’S LETTER,
1712,FATHER’S LETTER,"The yellow rooster froze his feet, a-wadin’ through the snow,"
1713,FATHER’S LETTER,And now he leans agin the fence when he starts in to crow;
1714,FATHER’S LETTER,The chestnut colt that was so skittish when _he_ went away--
1715,FATHER’S LETTER,I’ve broke him to the sulky and I drive him every day!
1716,FATHER’S LETTER,"We’ve got pink window curtains for the front spare-room up-stairs,"
1717,FATHER’S LETTER,And Lizzie’s made new covers for the parlor lounge and chairs;
1718,FATHER’S LETTER,We’ve roofed the barn and braced the elm that has the hangbird’s nest--
1719,FATHER’S LETTER,"Oh, there’s been lots of changes since our William went out West!"
1720,FATHER’S LETTER,
1721,FATHER’S LETTER,Old Uncle Enos Packard is getting mighty gay--
1722,FATHER’S LETTER,He gave Miss Susan Birchard a peach the other day!
1723,FATHER’S LETTER,"His late lamented Sarah hain’t been buried quite a year,"
1724,FATHER’S LETTER,So his purring ’round Miss Susan causes criticism here.
1725,FATHER’S LETTER,"At the last donation party, the minister opined"
1726,FATHER’S LETTER,"That, if he’d half suspicioned what was coming, he’d resigned;"
1727,FATHER’S LETTER,"For, though they brought him slippers like he was a centipede,"
1728,FATHER’S LETTER,His pantry was depleted by the consequential feed!
1729,FATHER’S LETTER,These are the things I’ll write him--our boy that’s in the West;
1730,FATHER’S LETTER,And I’ll tell him how we miss him--his mother and the rest;
1731,FATHER’S LETTER,"Why, we never have an apple-pie that mother doesn’t say:"
1732,FATHER’S LETTER,“_He_ liked it so--I wish that he could have a piece to-day!”
1733,FATHER’S LETTER,"I’ll tell him we are prospering, and hope he is the same--"
1734,FATHER’S LETTER,That we hope he’ll have no trouble getting on to wealth and fame;
1735,FATHER’S LETTER,"And just before I write “good-by from father and the rest,”"
1736,FATHER’S LETTER,"I’ll say that “mother sends her love,” and that will please him best."
1737,FATHER’S LETTER,
1738,FATHER’S LETTER,"For when _I_ went away from home, the weekly news I heard"
1739,FATHER’S LETTER,Was nothing to the tenderness I found in that one word--
1740,FATHER’S LETTER,"The sacred name of mother--why, even now as then,"
1741,FATHER’S LETTER,"The thought brings back the saintly face, the gracious love again;"
1742,FATHER’S LETTER,"And in my bosom seems to come a peace that is divine,"
1743,FATHER’S LETTER,As if an angel spirit communed a while with mine;
1744,FATHER’S LETTER,"And one man’s heart is strengthened by the message from above,"
1745,FATHER’S LETTER,And earth seems nearer heaven when “mother sends her love.”

1787,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Come, Harvey, let us sit a while and talk about the times"
1788,OUR WHIPPINGS,Before you went to selling clothes and I to peddling rimes--
1789,OUR WHIPPINGS,"The days when we were little boys, as naughty little boys"
1790,OUR WHIPPINGS,As ever worried home-folks with their everlasting noise!
1791,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Egad! and, were we so disposed, I’ll venture we could show"
1792,OUR WHIPPINGS,The scars of wallopings we got some forty years ago;
1793,OUR WHIPPINGS,What wallopings I mean I think I need not specify--
1794,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Mother’s whippings didn’t hurt, but father’s! oh, my!"
1795,OUR WHIPPINGS,
1796,OUR WHIPPINGS,The way that we played hookey those many years ago--
1797,OUR WHIPPINGS,We’d rather give ’most anything than have our children know!
1798,OUR WHIPPINGS,"The thousand naughty things we did, the thousand fibs we told--"
1799,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Why, thinking of them makes my presbyterian blood run cold!"
1800,OUR WHIPPINGS,How often Deacon Sabine Morse remarked if we were his
1801,OUR WHIPPINGS,He’d tan our “pesky little hides until the blisters riz!”
1802,OUR WHIPPINGS,It’s many a hearty thrashing to that Deacon Morse we owe--
1803,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Mother’s whippings didn’t count--father’s did, though!"
1804,OUR WHIPPINGS,
1805,OUR WHIPPINGS,"We used to sneak off swimmin’ in those careless, boyish days,"
1806,OUR WHIPPINGS,And come back home of evenings with our necks and backs ablaze;
1807,OUR WHIPPINGS,"How mother used to wonder why our clothes were full of sand,"
1808,OUR WHIPPINGS,"But father, having been a boy, appeared to understand."
1809,OUR WHIPPINGS,"And, after tea, he’d beckon us to join him in the shed"
1810,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Where he’d proceed to tinge our backs a deeper, darker red;"
1811,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Say what we will of mother’s, there is none will controvert"
1812,OUR WHIPPINGS,The proposition that our father’s lickings always hurt!
1813,OUR WHIPPINGS,
1814,OUR WHIPPINGS,For mother was by nature so forgiving and so mild
1815,OUR WHIPPINGS,That she inclined to spare the rod although she spoiled the child;
1816,OUR WHIPPINGS,"And when at last in self-defense she had to whip us, she"
1817,OUR WHIPPINGS,Appeared to feel those whippings a great deal more than we!
1818,OUR WHIPPINGS,"But how we bellowed and took on, as if we’d like to die--"
1819,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Poor mother really thought she hurt, and that’s what made _her_ cry!"
1820,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Then how we youngsters snickered as out the door we slid,"
1821,OUR WHIPPINGS,"For mother’s whippings never hurt, though father’s always did."
1822,OUR WHIPPINGS,
1823,OUR WHIPPINGS,"In after years poor father simmered down to five feet four,"
1824,OUR WHIPPINGS,But in our youth he seemed to us in height eight feet or more!
1825,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Oh, how we shivered when he quoth in cold, suggestive tone:"
1826,OUR WHIPPINGS,“I’ll see you in the woodshed after supper all alone!”
1827,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Oh, how the legs and arms and dust and trouser buttons flew--"
1828,OUR WHIPPINGS,What florid vocalisms marked that vesper interview!
1829,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Yes, after all this lapse of years, I feelingly assert,"
1830,OUR WHIPPINGS,"With all respect to mother, it was father’s whippings hurt!"
1831,OUR WHIPPINGS,
1832,OUR WHIPPINGS,The little boy experiencing that tingling ’neath his vest
1833,OUR WHIPPINGS,Is often loath to realize that all is for the best;
1834,OUR WHIPPINGS,"Yet, when the boy gets older, he pictures with delight"
1835,OUR WHIPPINGS,The buffetings of childhood--as we do here to-night.
1836,OUR WHIPPINGS,"The years, the gracious years, have smoothed and beautified the ways"
1837,OUR WHIPPINGS,That to our little feet seemed all too rugged in the days
1838,OUR WHIPPINGS,Before you went to selling clothes and I to peddling rimes--
1839,OUR WHIPPINGS,"So, Harvey, let us sit a while and think upon those times."

1981,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Heard, off beyond the pickerel pond,"
1982,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,The redwing-blackbird chide her mate.
1983,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"The bumblebee went bustling round,"

1987,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,
1988,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,Our eyes looked always at the hills--
1989,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,The Holyoke hills that seemed to stand
1990,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,Between us boys and pictured joys
1991,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,Of conquest in a further land!
1992,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Ah, how we coveted the time"
1993,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,When we should leave this prosy place
1994,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"And work our wills beyond those hills,"
1995,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,And meet creation face to face!
1996,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,
1997,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,You must have heard our childish talk--
1998,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,Perhaps our prattle gave you pain;
1999,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"For then, old friend, you seemed to bend"
2000,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,Your kindly arms about us twain.
2001,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"It might have been the wind that sighed,"
2002,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,And yet I thought I heard you say:
2003,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,“Seek not the ills beyond those hills--
2004,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Oh, stay with me, my children, stay!”"
2005,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,
2006,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"See, I’ve come back; the boy you knew"
2007,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Is wiser, older, sadder grown;"
2008,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"I come once more, just as of yore--"
2009,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"I come, but see! I come alone!"
2010,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"The memory of a brother’s love,"
2011,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Of blighted hopes, I bring with me,"
2012,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,And here I lay my heart to-day--
2013,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"A weary heart, O bell-flower tree!"
2014,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,
2015,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,So let me nestle in your shade
2016,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"As though I were a boy again,"
2017,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"And pray extend your arms, old friend,"
2018,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,And love me as you used to then.
2019,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,"Sing softly as you used to sing,"
2020,THE BELL-FLOWER TREE,And maybe I shall seem to be

2374,BAMBINO,Bambino in his cradle slept;
2375,BAMBINO,And by his side his grandam grim
2376,BAMBINO,"Bent down and smiled upon the child,"
2377,BAMBINO,"And sung this lullaby to him,--"
2378,BAMBINO,This “ninna and anninia”:
2379,BAMBINO,
2380,BAMBINO,"“When thou art older, thou shalt mind"
2381,BAMBINO,"To traverse countries far and wide,"
2382,BAMBINO,And thou shalt go where roses blow
2383,BAMBINO,And balmy waters singing glide--
2384,BAMBINO,So ninna and anninia!
2385,BAMBINO,
2386,BAMBINO,"“And thou shalt wear, trimmed up in points,"
2387,BAMBINO,"A famous jacket edged in red,"
2388,BAMBINO,"And, more than that, a peakéd hat,"
2389,BAMBINO,"All decked in gold, upon thy head--"
2390,BAMBINO,Ah! ninna and anninia!
2391,BAMBINO,
2392,BAMBINO,"“Then shalt thou carry gun and knife,"
2393,BAMBINO,Nor shall the soldiers bully thee;
2394,BAMBINO,"Perchance, beset by wrong or debt,"
2395,BAMBINO,A mighty bandit thou shalt be--
2396,BAMBINO,So ninna and anninia!
2397,BAMBINO,
2398,BAMBINO,“No woman yet of our proud race
2399,BAMBINO,Lived to her fourteenth year unwed;
2400,BAMBINO,The brazen churl that eyed a girl
2401,BAMBINO,Bought her the ring or paid his head--
2402,BAMBINO,So ninna and anninia!
2403,BAMBINO,
2404,BAMBINO,“But once came spies (I know the thieves!)
2405,BAMBINO,And brought disaster to our race;
2406,BAMBINO,God heard us when our fifteen men
2407,BAMBINO,Were hanged within the market-place--
2408,BAMBINO,But ninna and anninia!
2409,BAMBINO,
2410,BAMBINO,"“Good men they were, my babe, and true,--"
2411,BAMBINO,"Right worthy fellows all, and strong;"
2412,BAMBINO,Live thou and be for them and me
2413,BAMBINO,Avenger of that deadly wrong--
2414,BAMBINO,So ninna and anninia!”

2422,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"After dear old grandma died,"
2423,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Hunting through an oaken chest
2424,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"In the attic, we espied"
2425,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,What repaid our childish quest;
2426,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"’Twas a homely little slate,"
2427,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Seemingly of ancient date.
2428,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,
2429,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,On its quaint and battered face
2430,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Was the picture of a cart,"
2431,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Drawn with all that awkward grace
2432,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Which betokens childish art;
2433,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"But what meant this legend, pray:"
2434,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,“Homer drew this yesterday”?
2435,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,
2436,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Mother recollected then
2437,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,What the years were fain to hide--
2438,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,She was but a baby when
2439,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Little Homer lived and died;
2440,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Forty years, so mother said,"
2441,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Little Homer had been dead.
2442,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,
2443,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,This one secret through those years
2444,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Grandma kept from all apart,"
2445,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Hallowed by her lonely tears
2446,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,And the breaking of her heart;
2447,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,While each year that sped away
2448,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,Seemed to her but yesterday.
2449,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,
2450,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,So the homely little slate
2451,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Grandma’s baby’s fingers pressed,"
2452,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"To a memory consecrate,"
2453,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Lieth in the oaken chest,"
2454,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Where, unwilling we should know,"
2455,LITTLE HOMER’S SLATE,"Grandma put it, years ago."
