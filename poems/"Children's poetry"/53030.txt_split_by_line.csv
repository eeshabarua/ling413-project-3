46,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,
47,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"_The following verses have been selected from “Lilliput Levee,” 1868,"
48,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,and from W. B. Rands’ numerous contributions to magazines.[A] He wrote_
49,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"_under many signatures, never enumerated; but--with the generous"
50,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"assistance of his son, Mr. Paul W. Rands, and his publisher, Mr."
51,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,Alexander Strahan--I have been able to identify and examine all his
52,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"work. Three poems are included, by permission, from the reprint of"
53,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"“Lilliput Lectures,” which I lately edited for Mr. James Bowden. Messrs."
54,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,Dalziel have allowed me to use one from “Hood’s Comic Annual.” All other
55,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"rights belonged to Mr. Strahan, and have been transferred, with the full"
56,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"concurrence of Mr. P. W. Rands, to Mr. John Lane for this volume."
57,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"Nothing has been included from “Innocent’s Island,” which we hope to"
58,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,reprint shortly with some of the “Lilliput Revels.”
59,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,
60,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"These are poems for children, with whom Rands was always at his best,"
61,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,and have been chosen in remembrance of their tastes and understandings.
62,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,As many of them are printed from magazines and never received the
63,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"author’s final revision, I have occasionally edited the text, without"
64,THE EDITOR’S NOTE,"scruple, by omitting weak lines or even altering a word._"

266,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
267,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
268,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Where does Pinafore Palace stand?
269,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Right in the middle of Lilliput-land!
270,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"There the Queen eats bread-and-honey,"
271,LILLIPUT LEVEE,There the King counts up his money!
272,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
273,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Oh, the Glorious Revolution!"
274,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Oh, the Provisional Constitution!"
275,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Now that the children, clever bold folks,"
276,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Have turned the tables upon the Old Folks!
277,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
278,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Easily the thing was done,"
279,LILLIPUT LEVEE,For the children were more than two to one;
280,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Brave as lions, quick as foxes,"
281,LILLIPUT LEVEE,With hoards of wealth in their money-boxes!
282,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
283,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They seized the keys, they patrolled the street,"
284,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They drove the policeman off his beat,"
285,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They built barricades, they stationed sentries--"
286,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"You must give the word, when you come to the entries!"
287,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
288,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They dressed themselves, in the Riflemen’s clothes,"
289,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They had pea-shooters, they had arrows and bows,"
290,LILLIPUT LEVEE,So as to put resistance down--
291,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Order regions in Lilliput-town!
292,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
293,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They made the baker bake hot rolls,"
294,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They made the wharfinger send in coals,"
295,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They made the butcher kill the calf,"
296,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They cut the telegraph-wires in half.
297,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
298,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They went to the chemists, and with their feet"
299,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They kicked the physic all down the street;
300,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They went to the schoolroom and tore the books,"
301,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They munched the puffs at the pastrycook’s.
302,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
303,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They sucked the jam, they lost the spoons,"
304,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They sent up several fire-balloons,"
305,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They let off crackers, they burnt a guy,"
306,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They piled a bonfire ever so high.
307,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
308,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They offered a prize for the laziest boy,"
309,LILLIPUT LEVEE,And one for the most Magnificent toy;
310,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They split or burnt the canes offhand,"
311,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They made new laws in Lilliput-land.
312,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
313,LILLIPUT LEVEE,_Never do to-day what you can
314,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Put off till to-morrow_, one of them ran;"
315,LILLIPUT LEVEE,_Late to bed and late to rise_
316,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Was another law which they did devise.
317,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
318,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They passed a law to have always plenty
319,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Of beautiful things: we shall mention twenty:
320,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A magic lantern for all to see,"
321,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Rabbits to keep, and a Christmas-tree,"
322,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
323,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A boat, a house that went on wheels,"
324,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"An organ to grind, and sherry at meals,"
325,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Drums and wheelbarrows, Roman candles,"
326,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Whips with whistles let into the handles,"
327,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
328,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A real live giant, a roc to fly,"
329,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A goat to tease, a copper to sky,"
330,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A garret of apples, a box of paints,"
331,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"A saw and a hammer, and no complaints."
332,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
333,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Nail up the door, slide down the stairs,"
334,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Saw off the legs of the parlour chairs--
335,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"That was the way in Lilliput-land,"
336,LILLIPUT LEVEE,The children having the upper hand.
337,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
338,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They made the Old Folks come to school,"
339,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"And in pinafores,--that was the rule,--"
340,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Saying, _Eener-deener-diner-duss,"
341,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Kattler-wheeler-whiler-wuss_;
342,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
343,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They made them learn all sorts of things
344,LILLIPUT LEVEE,That nobody liked. They had catechisings;
345,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They kept them in, they sent them down"
346,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"In class, in school, in Lilliput-town."
347,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
348,LILLIPUT LEVEE,O but they gave them tit-for-tat!
349,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Thick bread-and-butter, and all that;"
350,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Stick-jaw pudding that tires your chin,"
351,LILLIPUT LEVEE,With the marmalade spread ever so thin!
352,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
353,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They governed the clock in Lilliput-land,"
354,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They altered the hour or the minute-hand,"
355,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"They made the day fast, they made the day slow,"
356,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Just as they wished the time to go.
357,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
358,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They never waited for king or for cat;
359,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They never wiped their shoes on the mat;
360,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Their joy was great; their joy was greater;
361,LILLIPUT LEVEE,They rode in the baby’s perambulator!
362,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
363,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"There was a Levee in Lilliput-town,"
364,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"At Pinafore Palace. Smith and Brown,"
365,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Jones and Robinson had to attend--
366,LILLIPUT LEVEE,All to whom they cards did send.
367,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
368,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Every one rode in a cab to the door;
369,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Every one came in a pinafore;
370,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Lady and gentleman, rat-tat-tat,"
371,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Loud knock, proud knock, opera hat!"
372,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
373,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"The place was covered with silver and gold,"
374,LILLIPUT LEVEE,The place was as full as it ever could hold;
375,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"The ladies kissed her Majesty’s hand,"
376,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Such was the custom in Lilliput-land.
377,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
378,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"His Majesty knighted eight or ten,"
379,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Perhaps a score, of the gentlemen,"
380,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Some of them short and some of them tall--
381,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"_Arise, Sir What’s-a-name What-do-you-call_!"
382,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
383,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Nuts and nutmeg (that’s in the negus);
384,LILLIPUT LEVEE,The bill of fare would perhaps fatigue us;
385,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Forty-five fiddlers to play the fiddle;
386,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Right foot, left foot, down the middle."
387,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
388,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Conjuring tricks with the poker and tongs,"
389,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Riddles and forfeits, singing of songs;"
390,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"One fat man, too fat by far,"
391,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"Tried “Twinkle, twinkle, little star.”"
392,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
393,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"His voice was gruff, his pinafore tight,"
394,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"His wife said, “Mind, dear, sing it right,”"
395,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"But he forgot, and said Fa-la-la!"
396,LILLIPUT LEVEE,The Queen of Lilliput’s own papa!
397,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
398,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"She frowned, and ordered him up to bed:"
399,LILLIPUT LEVEE,He said he was sorry; she shook her head;
400,LILLIPUT LEVEE,His clean shirt-front with his tears was stained--
401,LILLIPUT LEVEE,But discipline had to be maintained.
402,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
403,LILLIPUT LEVEE,The Constitution! The Law! The Crown!
404,LILLIPUT LEVEE,Order reigns in Lilliput-town!
405,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"The Queen is Jill, and the King is John;"
406,LILLIPUT LEVEE,I trust the Government will get on.
407,LILLIPUT LEVEE,
408,LILLIPUT LEVEE,"I noticed, being a man of rhymes,"
409,LILLIPUT LEVEE,An advertisement in the _Lilliput Times_:--
410,LILLIPUT LEVEE,“PINAFORE PALACE. This is to state
411,LILLIPUT LEVEE,That the Court is in want of a Laureate.

462,THE LOVE STORY,
463,THE LOVE STORY,This is the doll with respect to whom
464,THE LOVE STORY,A story is told that ends in gloom;
465,THE LOVE STORY,For there was a sensitive little sir
466,THE LOVE STORY,Went out of his mind for love of her!
467,THE LOVE STORY,
468,THE LOVE STORY,"They pulled a wire, she moved her eye;"
469,THE LOVE STORY,"They squeezed the bellows, they made her cry;"
470,THE LOVE STORY,But the boy could never be persuaded
471,THE LOVE STORY,That these were really things which _they_ did.
472,THE LOVE STORY,
473,THE LOVE STORY,"“My Dolladine,” he said, “has life;"
474,THE LOVE STORY,"I love her, and she shall be my wife;"
475,THE LOVE STORY,"Dainty delicate Dolladine,"
476,THE LOVE STORY,The prettiest girl that ever was seen!”
477,THE LOVE STORY,
478,THE LOVE STORY,"To give his passion a chance to cool,"
479,THE LOVE STORY,They sent the lover to boarding-school.
480,THE LOVE STORY,But absence only made it worse--
481,THE LOVE STORY,"He never learnt anything, prose or verse!"
482,THE LOVE STORY,
483,THE LOVE STORY,He drew her likeness on his slate;
484,THE LOVE STORY,"His Grammar was in a _dreadful_ state,"
485,THE LOVE STORY,"With Dolladine all over the edges,"
486,THE LOVE STORY,"And true-love knots, and vows, and pledges."
487,THE LOVE STORY,
488,THE LOVE STORY,What was the consequence?--Doctor Whack
489,THE LOVE STORY,Begged of his parents to take him back.
490,THE LOVE STORY,"When his condition, poor boy, was seen,"
491,THE LOVE STORY,"Too late, they sent for Dolladine."
492,THE LOVE STORY,
493,THE LOVE STORY,And now he will never part with her:
494,THE LOVE STORY,"He calls her lily, and rose, and myrrh,"
495,THE LOVE STORY,"Dolly-o’-diamonds, precious lamb,"
496,THE LOVE STORY,"Humming-bird, honey-pot, jewel, jam,"
497,THE LOVE STORY,
498,THE LOVE STORY,"Darling, delicate-dear-delight,"
499,THE LOVE STORY,"Angel-o’-red, angel-o’-white,"
500,THE LOVE STORY,"Queen of beauty, and suchlike names;"
501,THE LOVE STORY,In fact all manner of darts and flames!
502,THE LOVE STORY,
503,THE LOVE STORY,"Of course, while he keeps up this wooing"
504,THE LOVE STORY,His education goes to ruin:
505,THE LOVE STORY,"What are his prospects in future life,"
506,THE LOVE STORY,With only a doll for his lawful wife?
507,THE LOVE STORY,
508,THE LOVE STORY,It is feared his parents’ hearts will break!
509,THE LOVE STORY,And there’s one remark I wish to make:
510,THE LOVE STORY,"I may be wrong, but it seems a pity"
511,THE LOVE STORY,For a movable doll to be made too pretty.
512,THE LOVE STORY,
513,THE LOVE STORY,"An old-fashioned doll, that is not like nature,"
514,THE LOVE STORY,Can never pass for a human creature;
515,THE LOVE STORY,It is in a doll that moves her eyes
516,THE LOVE STORY,That the danger of these misfortunes lies!
517,THE LOVE STORY,
518,THE LOVE STORY,The lover’s name must be suppressed
519,THE LOVE STORY,"For obvious reasons. He lives out west,"
520,THE LOVE STORY,"And if I call him Pygmalion Pout,"
521,THE LOVE STORY,I don’t believe you will find him out!

528,DRESSING HER,This is the way we dress the Doll:--
529,DRESSING HER,"You may make her a shepherdess, the Doll,"
530,DRESSING HER,"If you give her a crook with a pastoral hook,"
531,DRESSING HER,But this is the way we dress the Doll.
532,DRESSING HER,
533,DRESSING HER,"_Chorus:_ Bless the Doll, you may press the Doll,"
534,DRESSING HER,But do not crumple and mess the Doll!
535,DRESSING HER,This is the way we dress the Doll.
536,DRESSING HER,
537,DRESSING HER,"First, you observe her little chemise,"
538,DRESSING HER,"As white as milk, with ruches of silk;"
539,DRESSING HER,"And the little drawers that cover her knees,"
540,DRESSING HER,"As she sits or stands, with golden bands,"
541,DRESSING HER,And lace in beautiful filagrees.
542,DRESSING HER,
543,DRESSING HER,"_Chorus:_ Bless the Doll, you may press the Doll,"
544,DRESSING HER,But do not crumple or mess the Doll!
545,DRESSING HER,This is the way we dress the Doll.
546,DRESSING HER,
547,DRESSING HER,"Now these are the bodies: she has two,"
548,DRESSING HER,"One of pink, with ruches of blue,"
549,DRESSING HER,"And sweet white lace; be careful, do!"
550,DRESSING HER,"And one of green, with buttons of sheen,"
551,DRESSING HER,"Buttons and bands of gold, I mean,"
552,DRESSING HER,"With lace on the border in lovely order,"
553,DRESSING HER,The most expensive we can afford her!
554,DRESSING HER,
555,DRESSING HER,"_Chorus:_ Bless the Doll, you may press the Doll,"
556,DRESSING HER,But do not crumple or mess the Doll!
557,DRESSING HER,This is the way we dress the Doll.
558,DRESSING HER,
559,DRESSING HER,"Then, with black at the border, jacket;"
560,DRESSING HER,And this--and this--she will not lack it;
561,DRESSING HER,"Skirts? Why, there are skirts, of course,"
562,DRESSING HER,"And shoes and stockings we shall enforce,"
563,DRESSING HER,"With a proper bodice, in the proper place"
564,DRESSING HER,(Stays that lace have had their days
565,DRESSING HER,"And made their martyrs); likewise garters,"
566,DRESSING HER,All entire. But our desire
567,DRESSING HER,"Is to show you her night attire,"
568,DRESSING HER,At least a part of it. Pray admire
569,DRESSING HER,This sweet white thing that she goes to bed in!
570,DRESSING HER,It’s not the one that’s made for her wedding;
571,DRESSING HER,"_That_ is special, a new design,"
572,DRESSING HER,"Made with a charm and a countersign,"
573,DRESSING HER,Three times three and nine times nine:
574,DRESSING HER,These are only her usual clothes:
575,DRESSING HER,"Look, _there’s_ a wardrobe! gracious knows"
576,DRESSING HER,"It’s pretty enough, as far as it goes!"
577,DRESSING HER,
578,DRESSING HER,So you see the way we dress the Doll:
579,DRESSING HER,"You might make her a shepherdess, the Doll,"
580,DRESSING HER,"If you gave her a crook with a pastoral hook,"
581,DRESSING HER,"With sheep, and a shed, and a shallow brook,"
582,DRESSING HER,"And all that, out of the poetry-book."
583,DRESSING HER,
584,DRESSING HER,"_Chorus:_ Bless the Doll, you may press the Doll,"
585,DRESSING HER,But do not crumple and mess the Doll!
586,DRESSING HER,This is the way we dress the Doll;
587,DRESSING HER,"If you had not seen, could you guess the Doll?"

595,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
596,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
597,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"The boys and girls were exceeding gay,"
598,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"With billycock bonnets and curds and whey,"
599,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And I thought that I was in Arcady,"
600,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,For the fringe of the forest was fair to see.
601,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
602,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,But the very first hayrick that I came to
603,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Did turn to a Doll’s House, fair and true;"
604,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"I saw with my eyes where the same did sit,"
605,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And there was a rainbow over it.
606,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
607,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"The people inside were setting the platters,"
608,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"The chairs and tables, and suchlike matters,"
609,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And making the beds and getting the tea:
610,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,But through a bow-window I saw the sea.
611,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
612,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Up came a damsel: “Sir,” she said,"
613,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,“Will you walk with me by my garden bed?
614,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Will you sit in my parlour by-and-by?”
615,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“I will sit in your parlour, my dear,” said I."
616,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
617,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“Will you hear my starling gossip?” said she,"
618,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And now I felt sure it was Arcady;
619,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,But a starling never could do the rhyming
620,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,That very soon in my ears was chiming:--
621,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
622,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“Jigglum-jogglum, Lilliputlandum,"
623,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Twopenny tiptop, sugaricandum,"
624,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Snip-snap snorum, hot-cross buns,"
625,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Conjugatorum, double-dunce."
626,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
627,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“Fannyfold funnyface, fairy-tale,"
628,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Cat in a cockle-boat, wigglum-whale,"
629,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Dickory-dolphin, humpty-hoo,"
630,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Floppety-fluteykin, tootle-tum-too.”"
631,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
632,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Said I, “There may be a clown outside,"
633,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And a clown I never could yet abide,--"
634,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"A picker and stealer, a clumsy joker,"
635,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Who stirs up his friends with a burning poker.
636,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
637,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“But perhaps,” said I, “I mistake the plan;"
638,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"It may be the Punch-and-Judy man,"
639,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Or the other, that keeps the galante show"
640,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And the marionettes, for what I know.”"
641,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
642,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Then I opened the window through thick and thin,"
643,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And in with a bounce came a Harlequin,"
644,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And very distinctly I heard a band
645,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Strike up the dances of Lilliput Land.
646,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
647,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"To wonder at this I did incline,"
648,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“And where,” said I, “is the Columbine--"
649,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Tip-toe twist-about, shimmer and shine,"
650,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Where is the beautiful Columbine?”
651,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
652,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Then out from the curtains, all shimmer and shine,"
653,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"With a rose-red sash came Columbine,"
654,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And Harlequin took her by the hand,"
655,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And they stepped it out in Lilliput Land;
656,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Twirl about, whirl about, shimmer and shine,"
657,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,O a rose-red sash had Columbine!
658,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
659,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Then one of the folks who had set the tea
660,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"In Doll’s House fashion, did climb my knee,"
661,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And he said, “Would you like, sir, to take a trip"
662,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,With me? Have you seen my little ship?”
663,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
664,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"The ship, as he called it, was certainly small,"
665,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,For the dot of a sailor could carry it all:
666,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"So both got in, and away went we,"
667,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,Coasting the sea-board of Arcady.
668,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
669,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Then I told a story, and he told one,"
670,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,But they both got mixed before they were done;
671,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And so did we, as the day grew dim,"
672,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And the child was myself, and myself was him."
673,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
674,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"But now it was getting time to land,"
675,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"So I stepped into Fleet Street, and went up the Strand,"
676,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,For I thought I should like to study the trade
677,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,They drive in toys at the Lowther Arcade.
678,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
679,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And whom should I see, at a Doll’s House door,"
680,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,But the very same damsel I met before!
681,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"“I thought I should see you again,” says she;"
682,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,“And a few of my friends will be here to tea.”
683,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
684,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"Then the Punch-and-Judy man came in,"
685,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And Columbine and the Harlequin,"
686,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"The man that patters in front of the show,"
687,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And the children--and how their tongues did go!
688,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,
689,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"But what makes the place so sweet? thought I,"
690,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"As scents of the heather and furze went by,"
691,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,And with them a whiff of the rolling sea;--
692,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,"And then I remembered Arcady,"
693,THE LITTLE DOLL’S HOUSE IN ARCADY,As the party were tittering over the tea.

999,THE DISCONTENTED YEW-TREE,
1000,THE DISCONTENTED YEW-TREE,Then crystal leaves crept over the boughs;

1554,I,
1555,I,"The Giant sat on a rock up high,"
1556,I,With the wind in his shaggy hair;
1557,I,"And he said, “I have drained the dairies dry,"
1558,I,And stripped the orchards bare;
1559,I,
1560,I,"“I have eaten the sheep, with the wool on their backs,”"
1561,I,"(A nasty giant was he,)"
1562,I,"“The eggs and the shells, the honey, the wax,"
1563,I,"The fowls, and the cock-turkéy;"
1564,I,
1565,I,[Illustration]
1566,I,
1567,I,“And now I think I could eat a score
1568,I,Of babies so plump and small;
1569,I,"And if, after that, I should want any more,"
1570,I,Their brothers and sisters and all.
1571,I,
1572,I,“To-morrow I’ll do it. Ha! what was that?”
1573,I,"Said he, for a sound he heard;"
1574,I,"“Was it fluttering owl or pattering rat,"
1575,I,Or bough to the breeze that stirred?”
1576,I,
1577,I,"Oh, it was neither rat nor owl,"
1578,I,Giant! nor shaking leaf;
1579,I,"Young Harold has heard your scheme so foul,"
1580,I,And it may come to grief!
1581,I,
1582,I,"One thing which you ate has escaped your mind,--"
1583,I,Young Harold his guinea-pig dear;
1584,I,And he has crept up to try and find
1585,I,"His pet, and he shakes with fear;"
1586,I,
1587,I,"He has hid himself in a corner, you know,"
1588,I,To listen and look about;
1589,I,"And if to the village to-morrow you go,"
1590,I,You may find the babes gone out!

1595,II,II
1596,II,
1597,II,"Now, when to the village came Harold back"
1598,II,"And told his tale so wild,"
1599,II,"Then every mother she cried, “Good lack!"
1600,II,My child! preserve my child!”
1601,II,
1602,II,And every father took his sword
1603,II,And sharpened it on a stone;
1604,II,"But little Harold said never a word,"
1605,II,Having a plan of his own.
1606,II,
1607,II,He laid six harrows outside the stile
1608,II,"That led to the village green,"
1609,II,"Then on them a little hay did pile,"
1610,II,For the prongs not to be seen.
1611,II,
1612,II,"A toothsome sucking-pig he slew,"
1613,II,And thereby did it lay;
1614,II,For why? Because young Harold knew
1615,II,The Giant would pass that way.
1616,II,
1617,II,"Then he went in and said his prayers,--"
1618,II,Not to lie down to sleep;
1619,II,But at his window up the stairs
1620,II,"A watch all night did keep,"
1621,II,
1622,II,"Till the little stars all went pale to bed,"
1623,II,"Because the sun was out,"
1624,II,"And the sky in the east grew dapple-red,"
1625,II,And the little birds chirped about.
1626,II,
1627,II,
1628,III,III
1629,III,
1630,III,"Now, all the village was early awake,"
1631,III,"And, with short space to pray,"
1632,III,"Their preparations they did make,"
1633,III,To bear the babes away.
1634,III,
1635,III,"The horses were being buckled in,--"
1636,III,"The little ones looked for a ride,--"
1637,III,"When on came the Giant, as ugly as Sin,"
1638,III,With a terrible six-yard stride.
1639,III,
1640,III,Then every woman and every child
1641,III,To scream aloud began;
1642,III,"Young Harold up at his watch-tower smiled,"
1643,III,And his sword drew every man;
1644,III,
1645,III,"For now the Giant, fierce and big,"
1646,III,"Came near to the stile by the green,"
1647,III,But when he saw that luscious pig
1648,III,His lips grew wet between!
1649,III,
1650,III,"Now, left foot, right foot, step it again,"
1651,III,He trod on----the harrow spikes!
1652,III,And how he raged and roared with pain
1653,III,He may describe who likes.
1654,III,
1655,III,"At last he fell, and as he lay"
1656,III,"Loud bellowing on the ground,"
1657,III,"The stalwart men of the village, they"
1658,III,With drawn swords danced around.
1659,III,
1660,III,"“O spare my life, I you entreat!"
1661,III,I will be a Giant good!
1662,III,"O take out those thorns that prick my feet,"
1663,III,Which now are bathed in blood!”
1664,III,
1665,III,Then the little village maids did feel
1666,III,"For this Giant so shaggy-haired,"
1667,III,"And to their parents they did kneel,"
1668,III,"Saying, “Let his life be spared!”"
1669,III,
1670,III,His bleeding wounds the maids did bind;
1671,III,They framed a litter strong
1672,III,With all the hurdles they could find;
1673,III,Six horses drew him along;
1674,III,
1675,III,And all the way to his castle rude
1676,III,"Up high in the piny rocks,"
1677,III,He promised to be a Giant good--
1678,III,"The cruel, crafty fox!"
1679,III,
1680,III,
1681,IV,IV
1682,IV,
1683,IV,"“O mother, lend me your largest tub!”--"
1684,IV,"“Why, daughter? tell me quick!”--"
1685,IV,"“O mother, to make a syllabub"
1686,IV,For the Giant who is so sick.”
1687,IV,
1688,IV,"Now in fever-fit the Giant lay,"
1689,IV,"From the pain in his wounded feet,"
1690,IV,And hoping soon would come the day
1691,IV,When he might the babies eat.
1692,IV,
1693,IV,"“O mother, dress me in white, I beg,"
1694,IV,With flowers and pretty gear;
1695,IV,"For Mary and Madge, and Jess and Peg,"
1696,IV,"And all my playmates dear,"
1697,IV,
1698,IV,"“We go to the Giant’s this afternoon,"
1699,IV,"To carry him something nice,--"
1700,IV,"A custard three times as big as the moon,"
1701,IV,With sugar and wine and spice.”
1702,IV,
1703,IV,"“O daughter, your father shall go with you;"
1704,IV,"Suppose the Giant is well,"
1705,IV,"And eats you up, what shall we do?”"
1706,IV,Then her thought did Alice tell:--
1707,IV,
1708,IV,"“No, mother dear; we go alone,"
1709,IV,And Heaven for us will care;
1710,IV,"If the Giant bad has a heart of stone,"
1711,IV,We will soften it with prayer!”
1712,IV,
1713,IV,"Now, when the Giant saw these maids,"
1714,IV,"Drest all in white, draw near,"
1715,IV,"He twitched his monstrous shoulder-blades,"
1716,IV,And dropped an honest tear!
1717,IV,
1718,IV,"“Dear Giant, a syllabub nice we bring,"
1719,IV,Pray let us tuck you in!”
1720,IV,"The Giant said, “Sweet innocent thing!"
1721,IV,"“Oh, I am a lump of sin!"
1722,IV,
1723,IV,"“Go home, and say to the man of prayer"
1724,IV,"To make the church-door wide,"
1725,IV,"For I next Sunday will be there,"
1726,IV,"And kneel, dears, at your side."
1727,IV,
1728,IV,“Tell brave young Harold I forgive
1729,IV,Him for the harrow-spikes;
1730,IV,"And I will do, please Heaven I live,"
1731,IV,What penance the prayer-man likes.
1732,IV,
1733,IV,"“Set down, my dears, the syllabub,"
1734,IV,"And as I better feel,"
1735,IV,I’ll try and eat a fox’s cub
1736,IV,At my next mid-day meal;
1737,IV,
1738,IV,“And all my life the village I’ll keep
1739,IV,From harmful vermin free;
1740,IV,"But never more will eat up the sheep,"
1741,IV,"The honey, or cock-turkéy!”"
1742,IV,
1743,IV,
1744,V,V
1745,V,
1746,V,"Now Sunday came, and in the aisle"
1747,V,Did kneel the Giant tall;
1748,V,"The priest could not forbear a smile,"
1749,V,The church it looked so small!
1750,V,
1751,V,"And, as the Giant walked away,"
1752,V,He knocked off the roof with his head;
1753,V,"But he quarried stones on the following day,"
1754,V,To build another instead.
1755,V,
1756,V,[Illustration]
1757,V,
1758,V,"And it was high and broad and long,"
1759,V,"And a hundred years it stood,"
1760,V,To tell of the Giant so cruel and strong
1761,V,That kindness had made good.
1762,V,
1763,V,"And when Harold and Alice were married there,"
1764,V,A handsome sight was seen;
1765,V,"For the bridegroom was brave, and the bride was fair--"

2451,THE ABSENT BOY,"I know an absent-minded boy,"
2452,THE ABSENT BOY,To meditate is all his joy;
2453,THE ABSENT BOY,He seldom does the thing he ought
2454,THE ABSENT BOY,Because he is so rapt in thought.
2455,THE ABSENT BOY,
2456,THE ABSENT BOY,At marbles he can never win;
2457,THE ABSENT BOY,He wears his waistcoat outside in;
2458,THE ABSENT BOY,He cannot add a sum up right;
2459,THE ABSENT BOY,And often he is not polite.
2460,THE ABSENT BOY,
2461,THE ABSENT BOY,"His mother cries, “My poor heart breaks,"
2462,THE ABSENT BOY,Because the child makes such mistakes;
2463,THE ABSENT BOY,"He never knows,” she says with sighs,"
2464,THE ABSENT BOY,“Which side his bread the butter lies!”
2465,THE ABSENT BOY,
2466,THE ABSENT BOY,"One day, absorbed in meditation,"
2467,THE ABSENT BOY,"He roamed into a railway station,"
2468,THE ABSENT BOY,And in a corner of a train
2469,THE ABSENT BOY,"Sat down, with inattentive brain."
2470,THE ABSENT BOY,
2471,THE ABSENT BOY,"They rang the bell, the whistle blew,"
2472,THE ABSENT BOY,"They shook the flags, the engine flew;"
2473,THE ABSENT BOY,But all the noise did not induce
2474,THE ABSENT BOY,This boy to quit his mood abstruse.
2475,THE ABSENT BOY,
2476,THE ABSENT BOY,And when three hours were past and gone
2477,THE ABSENT BOY,He found himself at Something_ton_;
2478,THE ABSENT BOY,"“What is this place?” he sighed in vain,"
2479,THE ABSENT BOY,For railway men can not speak plain.
2480,THE ABSENT BOY,
2481,THE ABSENT BOY,When he got home his parents had
2482,THE ABSENT BOY,"To pay his fare, which was too bad;"
2483,THE ABSENT BOY,"More than two hundred miles, alas!"
2484,THE ABSENT BOY,The Absent Boy had gone first-class.
2485,THE ABSENT BOY,
2486,THE ABSENT BOY,"For fear he should, in absentness,"
2487,THE ABSENT BOY,Forget his own name and address
2488,THE ABSENT BOY,"Whilst he pursues his meditations,"
2489,THE ABSENT BOY,"And so be lost to his relations,"
2490,THE ABSENT BOY,
2491,THE ABSENT BOY,Would it be best that he should wear
2492,THE ABSENT BOY,A collar like our Tray? or bear
2493,THE ABSENT BOY,His name and home in indigo
2494,THE ABSENT BOY,"Pricked on his shoulder, or below?"
2495,THE ABSENT BOY,
2496,THE ABSENT BOY,The chief objection to this plan
2497,THE ABSENT BOY,"Is, that his father is a man"
2498,THE ABSENT BOY,Who often moves. If we begin
2499,THE ABSENT BOY,"To prick the Boy’s home on his skin,"
2500,THE ABSENT BOY,
2501,THE ABSENT BOY,Before long he will be tattooed
2502,THE ABSENT BOY,With indigo from head to foot:
2503,THE ABSENT BOY,Perhaps a label on his chest

2626,I,With his double great-toe and his double great thumb?
2627,I,
2628,I,"Did you ever hear Giant Frodgedobbulum,"
2629,I,Saying _Fa-fe-fi_ and _fo-faw-fum_?
2630,I,
2631,I,"He shakes the earth as he walks along,"
2632,I,"As deep as the sea, as far as Hong-kong!"
2633,I,
2634,I,He is a giant and no mistake;
2635,I,With teeth like the prongs of a garden rake!
2636,I,
2637,I,
2638,II,II
2639,II,
2640,II,"The Giant Frodgedobbulum got out of bed,"

2642,II,
2643,II,"The Giant Frodgedobbulum sat in his chair,"
2644,II,"Saying, “Why should a giant be wanting a fair?”"
2645,II,
2646,II,"The Giant Frodgedobbulum said to his boots,"
2647,II,"“The first maid I meet I will wed, if she suits!”"
2648,II,
2649,II,"They were Magic Boots, and they laughed as he spoke--"
2650,II,"“Oh, ho,” says the giant, “you think it’s a joke?”"
2651,II,
2652,II,
2653,III,III
2654,III,
2655,III,"So he put on his boots, and came stumping down,"
2656,III,"Clatter and clump, into Banbury town--"
2657,III,
2658,III,"He did not fly into Banbury,"
2659,III,For plenty of time to walk had he!
2660,III,
2661,III,"He kicked at the gate--“Within there, ho!”"
2662,III,"“Oh, what is your name?” says the porter Slow."
2663,III,
2664,III,"“Oh, the Giant Frodgedobbulum am I,"
2665,III,For a wife out of Banbury town I sigh!”
2666,III,
2667,III,"Up spake the porter, bold and free,"
2668,III,“Your room we prefer to your company.”
2669,III,
2670,III,"Up spake Frodgedobbulum, free and bold,"
2671,III,“I will build up your town with silver and
2672,III,gold!”
2673,III,
2674,III,"Up spake Marjorie, soft and small,"
2675,III,“I will not be your wife at all!”
2676,III,
2677,III,"The giant knocked in the gate with his feet,"
2678,III,And there stood Marjorie in the street!
2679,III,
2680,III,"She was nine years old, she was lissome and fair,"
2681,III,And she wore emeralds in her hair.
2682,III,
2683,III,"She could dance like a leaf, she could sing like a thrush,"
2684,III,"She was bold as the north wind, and sweet as a blush."
2685,III,
2686,III,"Her father tanned, her mother span,"
2687,III,"“But Marjorie shall marry a gentleman,--"
2688,III,
2689,III,"Silks and satins, I’ll lay you a crown!”--"
2690,III,So said the people in Banbury town.
2691,III,
2692,III,Such was Marjorie--and who should come
2693,III,"To woo her but this Frodgedobbulum,"
2694,III,
2695,III,"A vulgar giant, who wore no gloves,"
2696,III,And very pig-headed in his loves!
2697,III,
2698,III,
2699,IV,IV
2700,IV,
2701,IV,"They rang the alarum, and in the steeple"
2702,IV,They tolled the church-bells to rouse the people.
2703,IV,
2704,IV,But all the people in Banbury town
2705,IV,Could not put Frodgedobbulum down.
2706,IV,
2707,IV,The tanner thought to stab him dead--
2708,IV,“Somebody pricked me?” the giant said.
2709,IV,
2710,IV,"The mother wept--“I do not care,”"
2711,IV,Said F.--“Why should I be wanting a fair?”
2712,IV,
2713,IV,"He snatched up Marjorie, stroked his boot,"
2714,IV,And fled; with Banbury in pursuit!
2715,IV,
2716,IV,"“What ho, my boots! put forth your power!"
2717,IV,Carry me sixty miles an hour!”
2718,IV,
2719,IV,"In ditches and dykes, over stocks and stones,"
2720,IV,"The Banbury people fell, with groans."
2721,IV,
2722,IV,"Frodgedobbulum passed over river and tree,"
2723,IV,"Gallopy-gallop, with Marjorie;--"
2724,IV,
2725,IV,The people beneath her Marjorie sees
2726,IV,Of the size of mites in an Oxford cheese!
2727,IV,
2728,IV,
2729,V,V
2730,V,
2731,V,Castle Frodgedobbulum sulked between
2732,V,"Two bleak hills, in a deep ravine."
2733,V,
2734,V,"It was always dark there, and always drear,"
2735,V,"The same time of day and the same time of year,"
2736,V,
2737,V,"The walls of the castle were slimy and black,"
2738,V,"There were dragons in front, and toads at the back."
2739,V,
2740,V,"Spiders there were, and of vampires lots;"
2741,V,Ravens croaked round the chimney-pots.
2742,V,
2743,V,Seven bull-dogs barked in the hall;
2744,V,Seven wild cats did caterwaul!
2745,V,
2746,V,"The giant said, with a smirk on his face,"
2747,V,"“My Marjorie, this is a pretty place;"
2748,V,
2749,V,"As Mrs. F. you will lead, with me,"
2750,V,A happier life than in Banbury!
2751,V,
2752,V,"Pour out my wine, and comb my hair,"
2753,V,And put me to sleep in my easy chair;
2754,V,
2755,V,"But, first, my boots I will kick away”--"
2756,V,"And Marjorie answered, “_S’il vous plait!_”"
2757,V,
2758,V,"Then the giant mused, “It befits my station"
2759,V,To marry a lady of education;
2760,V,
2761,V,But who would have thought this Banbury wench
2762,V,"Was so accomplished, and could speak French?”"
2763,V,
2764,V,Did you ever hear Frodgedobbulum snore?
2765,V,He shook the castle from roof to floor!
2766,V,
2767,V,Fast asleep as a pig was he--
2768,V,“And very much like one!” thought Marjorie.
2769,V,
2770,V,
2771,VI,VI
2772,VI,
2773,VI,"Then Marjorie stood on a leathern chair,"
2774,VI,And opened the window to the air.
2775,VI,
2776,VI,"The bats flap, the owls hoot--"
2777,VI,Marjorie lifted the giant’s boot!
2778,VI,
2779,VI,"The ravens shriek, the owls hoot--"
2780,VI,Marjorie got into the giant’s boot!
2781,VI,
2782,VI,"And Marjorie said, “I can reach the moon"
2783,VI,"Before you waken, you big buffoon!”"
2784,VI,
2785,VI,"Once, twice, three times, and away,--"
2786,VI,"“Which is the road to Banbury, pray?”"
2787,VI,
2788,VI,"The Boot made answer, “Hah, hah! hoh, hoh!"
2789,VI,The road to Banbury town I know.”
2790,VI,
2791,VI,
2792,VII,VII
2793,VII,
2794,VII,"The giant awoke in his easy chair,"
2795,VII,"Saying, “Ho, little Marjorie, are you there?"
2796,VII,
2797,VII,"A stoup of wine, to be spiced the same!--"
2798,VII,"Exquisite Marjorie, _je vous aime_!”"
2799,VII,
2800,VII,Now where was Marjorie? Safe and sound
2801,VII,In the Magic Boot she cleared the ground.
2802,VII,
2803,VII,Frodgedobbulum groaned--“I am bereft!
2804,VII,"The left boot’s gone, and the right is left!--"
2805,VII,
2806,VII,The window’s open! I’ll bet a crown
2807,VII,The chit is off to Banbury town!
2808,VII,
2809,VII,"But follow, follow, my faithful Boot!"
2810,VII,One is enough for the pursuit;
2811,VII,
2812,VII,And back to my arms the wench shall come
2813,VII,As sure as my name’s Frodgedobbulum!”
2814,VII,
2815,VII,
2816,VIII,VIII
2817,VIII,
2818,VIII,"Hasty Frodgedobbulum, being a fool,"
2819,VIII,Forgot of the Magic Boots the rule.
2820,VIII,
2821,VIII,"They were made on a right and a left boot-tree,"
2822,VIII,"But he put the wrong leg in the boot, you see!"
2823,VIII,
2824,VIII,It was a terrible mistake
2825,VIII,For even a giant in love to make--
2826,VIII,
2827,VIII,"Terrible in its consequences,"
2828,VIII,Frightful to any man’s seven senses!
2829,VIII,
2830,VIII,"Down came a thunderbolt, rumble and glare!"
2831,VIII,Frodgedobbulum Castle blew up in the air!
2832,VIII,
2833,VIII,"The giant, deprived of self-control,"
2834,VIII,Was carried away to the very North Pole;
2835,VIII,
2836,VIII,For such was the magic rule. Poor F.
2837,VIII,Now sits on the peak of the Arctic cliff!
2838,VIII,
2839,VIII,The point is so sharp it makes him shrink;
2840,VIII,"The northern streamers, they make him blink;"

2973,MISS HOOPER,"Miss Hooper was a little girl,"
2974,MISS HOOPER,Whose head was always in a whirl;
2975,MISS HOOPER,For she had hoop upon the head--
2976,MISS HOOPER,"“My precious, precious hoop!” she said."
2977,MISS HOOPER,
2978,MISS HOOPER,Trundling a hoop was her delight
2979,MISS HOOPER,"From breakfast time to nearly night,"
2980,MISS HOOPER,"She loved it so! and, truth to tell,"
2981,MISS HOOPER,At last she drove her hoop too well.
2982,MISS HOOPER,
2983,MISS HOOPER,That hoop began to go one day
2984,MISS HOOPER,As if it never meant to stay;
2985,MISS HOOPER,"Of course the girl would not give in,"
2986,MISS HOOPER,But followed it through thick and thin.
2987,MISS HOOPER,
2988,MISS HOOPER,The King and Queen came out to see
2989,MISS HOOPER,What sort of hoop this hoop might be;
2990,MISS HOOPER,"My Lady said, “I think, my Lord,"

2992,MISS HOOPER,
2993,MISS HOOPER,"This vexed the little girl, and so"
2994,MISS HOOPER,"She gave the hoop another blow,"
2995,MISS HOOPER,"And off it went--oh, just like mad--"
2996,MISS HOOPER,She ran with all the strength she had.
2997,MISS HOOPER,
2998,MISS HOOPER,"Her hat-strings slipped, her hat hung back,"

3013,MISS HOOPER,"At last she fainted, with a flop."
3014,MISS HOOPER,
3015,MISS HOOPER,"When she came to she sighed, with pain,"
3016,MISS HOOPER,“I’ll never touch a hoop again!”
3017,MISS HOOPER,"Is it not sad, when girls and boys"
3018,MISS HOOPER,Go to excess like this with toys?
3019,MISS HOOPER,
3020,MISS HOOPER,"As for the hoop, the people say"
3021,MISS HOOPER,"It kept on going night and day,"
3022,MISS HOOPER,"Turning the corners, quite correct,--"
3023,MISS HOOPER,A thing which you would not expect.
3024,MISS HOOPER,
3025,MISS HOOPER,"And so it lived, a hoop at large,"
3026,MISS HOOPER,Which no one dared to take in charge;
3027,MISS HOOPER,"Of course it thinned, but kept its shape,"
3028,MISS HOOPER,A sort of hoop of wooden tape.
3029,MISS HOOPER,
3030,MISS HOOPER,It thinned till people took a glass
3031,MISS HOOPER,"To see the ghostly circle pass,"
3032,MISS HOOPER,And only stopped--the facts are so--
3033,MISS HOOPER,When there was nothing left to go.

3186,II,"“O I should like to see the feast,"
3187,II,"But my frock is old, my shoes are pieced,"

3189,II,
3190,II,The clock struck three! She durst not go!
3191,II,"But she heard the band, and to see the show"
3192,II,Crept after the people that went in a row.
3193,II,
3194,II,When Cicely came to the castle gate
3195,II,"The porter exclaimed, “Miss Shaggypate,"
3196,II,"The hall is full, and you come too late!”"
3197,II,
3198,II,"Just then the music made a din,"

3201,II,
3202,II,Oh what a sight! full fifty score
3203,II,"Of dames that Cicely knew, and more,"
3204,II,Filling the hall from daïs to door!
3205,II,
3206,II,"The dresses were like a garden-bed,"
3207,II,"Green and gold, and blue and red,--"
3208,II,Poor Cicely thought of her tossy head!
3209,II,
3210,II,She heard the singing--she heard the clatter--
3211,II,"Clang of flagon, and clink of platter--"
3212,II,"But, oh, the feast was no such matter!"
3213,II,
3214,II,"For she saw Sir Nicholas himself,"
3215,II,"Raised on a daïs just like a shelf,"
3216,II,And fell in love with him--shabby elf!
3217,II,
3218,II,"Her heart beat quick; aside she stept,"
3219,II,"Under the tapestry she crept,"
3220,II,"Touzling her tossy hair, and wept!"
3221,II,
3222,II,"Her cheeks were wet, her eyes were red--"
3223,II,“Who makes that noise?” the ladies said;
3224,II,“Turn out that girl with the shaggy head!”
3225,II,
3226,II,
3227,III,III
3228,III,
3229,III,"Just then there was heard a double roar,"
3230,III,"That shook the place, both wall and floor:"
3231,III,Everybody looked to the door.
3232,III,
3233,III,"It was a roar, it was a growl;"
3234,III,"The ladies set up a little howl,"
3235,III,And flapped and clucked like frightened fowl.
3236,III,
3237,III,Sir Hildebrand for silence begs--
3238,III,"In walk the bears on their hinder legs,"
3239,III,"Wise as owls, and merry as grigs!"
3240,III,
3241,III,The dark girls tore their hair of sable;
3242,III,The fair girls hid underneath the table;
3243,III,Some fainted; to move they were not able.
3244,III,
3245,III,But most of them could scream and screech--
3246,III,Sir Nicholas Hildebrand made a speech--
3247,III,"“Order! ladies, I do beseech!”"
3248,III,
3249,III,The bears looked hard at Cicely
3250,III,Because her hair hung wild and free--
3251,III,"“Related to us, miss, you must be!”"
3252,III,
3253,III,"Then Cicely, filling two plates of gold"
3254,III,"As full of cherries as they could hold,"
3255,III,"Walked up to the bears, and spoke out bold:--"
3256,III,
3257,III,"“Welcome to you! and to _you_, Mr. Bear!"
3258,III,Will you take a chair? will _you_ take a chair?”
3259,III,"“This is an honour, we do declare!”"
3260,III,
3261,III,"Sir Hildebrand strode up to see,"
3262,III,"Saying, “Who may this maiden be?"
3263,III,"Ladies, this is the wife for me!”"
3264,III,
3265,III,"Almost before they could understand,"
3266,III,"He took up Cicely by the hand,"
3267,III,And danced with her a saraband.
3268,III,
3269,III,"Her hair was as rough as a parlour broom,"
3270,III,"It swung, it swirled all round the room--"
3271,III,"Those ladies were vexed, we may presume."
3272,III,
3273,III,"Sir Nicholas kissed her on the face,"
3274,III,"And set her beside him on the daïs,"
3275,III,And made her the lady of the place.

3292,III,
3293,III,With one cheer more (if you will wait)
3294,III,For every girl with a curly pate
3295,III,Who keeps her hair in a proper state.
3296,III,
3297,III,Sing bear’s grease! curling-irons to sell!

3467,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,A harvest moon! Was ever seen
3468,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,A harvest moon so bright?
3469,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"The crowded ivy, darkly green,"
3470,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Was touched with primrose white.
3471,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3472,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"The quiet skies uncovered lay,"
3473,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"And, far as you could see,"
3474,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,The night was like a ghostly day
3475,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"On road, and field, and tree."
3476,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3477,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Silence and light! Will nothing speak
3478,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,In the light and silence wide?
3479,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"O lady moon, your other cheek"
3480,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Why do you always hide?
3481,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3482,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"Sweet on the air was the jessamine,"
3483,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,As I stood at my gate;
3484,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"Yet I shuddered, and thought, “I will go in,--"
3485,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,The silence is too great!”
3486,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3487,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,I looked to where the hill-tops showed
3488,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"Behind the poplars green,"
3489,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,When there came trotting down the road
3490,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,A dog--the dog was lean;
3491,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3492,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"And you could tell, as he came by,"
3493,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"He had no friend on earth,"
3494,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Nobody in whose partial eye
3495,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,He was of any worth.
3496,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3497,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,His tail hung down; his matted hair
3498,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Was like a worn-out thatch;
3499,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,This dog came trotting up to where
3500,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"The moonlight made a patch,"
3501,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3502,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Falling between two poplar-trees;
3503,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"And there the dog turned round,"
3504,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"Round, and round, by slow degrees--"
3505,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Then crouched upon the ground.
3506,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3507,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"And I brought forth some broken food,"
3508,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"And cried, “Old dog, get up!"
3509,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"That patch of moonlight may be good,"
3510,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,But on it you cannot sup.”
3511,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3512,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"He came away--came many a pace,"
3513,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And took what I bestowed;
3514,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"Then, being refreshed, snuffed all the place,"
3515,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And up and down the road.
3516,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3517,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,I showed him where the thick grass grew
3518,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Against a sheltering wall;
3519,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"I said, “Here is a bed for you,"
3520,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,With half-a-house and all.”
3521,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3522,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,But two hours after--I kept watch
3523,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,From my bedroom window-pane--
3524,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,I saw that on that moony patch
3525,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,He had lain down again!
3526,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3527,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And in the morning he was gone.--
3528,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,What charm was it he found
3529,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,In sleeping where the moonlight shone
3530,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,In a patch upon the ground?
3531,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"He might have slept where he had his bone,"
3532,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Where the moon shone all around!
3533,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3534,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"I am a superstitious man,"
3535,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And it is my delight
3536,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"To think there was a magic plan,"
3537,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"A meaning, in that night!"
3538,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3539,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"That magic dog that lay i’ the moon,"
3540,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"He will come back to me,"
3541,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"A fairy princess bright and boon,"
3542,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,Whom I that night set free!
3543,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3544,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"There was a mystery in the air,"
3545,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And in the primrose light;
3546,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"The silence seemed to say, “Prepare!"
3547,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,It shall be done to-night!”
3548,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3549,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,And could that mystery only mean
3550,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,A dog that was not fat?
3551,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,I saw a glint of elfin green
3552,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,In the moonshine where he sat--
3553,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,
3554,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"I heard the midnight clocks all round,"
3555,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,In distant falls and swells--
3556,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"I heard a little silver sound,"
3557,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,The clink of elfin bells--
3558,THE DOG AND THE PATCH OF MOONSHINE,"But will my princess be unbound,"

3814,II,

3832,II,"That Little Boy is still but little Master What-do-you-call,"

4056,IX,"His mad guffaws for a mile they hear,"

4074,IX,And made him laugh like a thousand men!
4075,IX,
4076,IX,"He laughed all day, he laughed all night,"
4077,IX,"He laughed when they woke in the morning light,"
4078,IX,"He laughed that week and the fortnight after,--"
4079,IX,Travellers came to hear his laughter!
4080,IX,
4081,IX,They let him laugh on to his heart’s content
4082,IX,In a show as high as the Monument;
4083,IX,They gave to Lucy a penny clear

4198,XVII,
4199,XVII,Will he make out what the book is about
4200,XVII,Before it is time to sup?
4201,XVII,His fist he doubles;
4202,XVII,He blows little bubbles;

4217,XVIII,And did not find it good;
4218,XVIII,
4219,XVIII,"For the water was bitter,"
4220,XVIII,"And made her twitter,"

4342,I,What have you got to tell?”
4343,I,"And the clapper rose and fell,"

4347,I,
4348,I,"Here is pencil, and here is pen,"

4353,I,
4354,I,"First there is Ding, a dot of a thing,"
4355,I,"And, not to go wrong, her brother Dong,"
4356,I,"A little older and ever so much bolder,"
4357,I,"And both of them seem ready to sing,"
4358,I,And Dell will belong and take part in the song.
4359,I,
4360,I,Now Dell--I am not so sure about Dell--
4361,I,"Dell wears a mask, and hides till you ask,"
4362,I,And peeps at you from over a screen;
4363,I,"But if you must know the truth of it,--well!--"
4364,I,I really am not so sure about Dell.
4365,I,
4366,I,"So Ding, Dong, and Dell"

4382,II,"“My eyes are strong,"
4383,II,"You know,” says Dong,"
4384,II,“And once on a time I saw through a wall.”
4385,II,"“And so did I,” says little Ding,"
4386,II,“I also can do a wonderful thing.”
4387,II,
4388,II,"Thus they disputed, and by-and-bye"
4389,II,Poor little Ding began to cry.
4390,II,"“You didn’t,” says Dong; “it isn’t true----”"
4391,II,"I did, you didn’t, no more did you,"
4392,II,"You didn’t, I did, you didn’t, pooh!"
4393,II,
4394,II,"So they came squabbling to Dell, who said,"
4395,II,“You both deserve to be put to bed.
4396,II,"When Ding saw through a wall, the wall"
4397,II,"Was made of glass, and that is all!"
4398,II,"When Dong saw through a wall, it had"
4399,II,"A hole in it.” Then both were glad,"
4400,II,"Ding and Dong, that they thought to ask"
4401,II,"Dell of the screen, who wore the mask;"

4413,III,To go in masks for ever.
4414,III,Is there wisdom in a mask?

4428,IV,"And went to bed,"
4429,IV,Because she had caught such a pain in her head!
4430,IV,"The German bricks,"

4744,XVII,
4745,XVII,"“Bell, bell, how high do you hang?”"

4760,XVII,BETSY BOUNCE--her taste was such--
4761,XVII,Of her bonnet thought too much;
4762,XVII,"Strutting up and down she went,"
4763,XVII,(People wondered what she meant).
4764,XVII,
4765,XVII,In the villages and towns
4766,XVII,"Folks said, “Look how Betsy Bounce"
4767,XVII,Takes her walks around the nation!”
4768,XVII,She thought this was admiration.
4769,XVII,
4770,XVII,"“Oh, that all the world,” says she,"
4771,XVII,"“Could my lovely bonnet see,"
4772,XVII,"See my bonnet, but without"
4773,XVII,All this walking round about!”
4774,XVII,
4775,XVII,"For in truth the girl got tired,"
4776,XVII,"Though her bonnet was admired,"
4777,XVII,Of this walking round the nation
4778,XVII,After people’s admiration.
4779,XVII,
4780,XVII,Now observe what came to pass--
4781,XVII,One fine day this foolish lass
4782,XVII,"Found her bonnet growing, growing"
4783,XVII,On her head like flowers a-blowing!
4784,XVII,
4785,XVII,"Higher still, and higher piled"
4786,XVII,"Grew the bonnet on the child,"
4787,XVII,"Farther back and farther out,"
4788,XVII,Farther down and round about!
4789,XVII,
4790,XVII,Rivers sprawling to the sea
4791,XVII,"Both the strings appeared to be,"
4792,XVII,Till the bow beneath her chin
4793,XVII,Shut her up and shut her in.
4794,XVII,
4795,XVII,"Oh, how foreigners did stare"
4796,XVII,"When her bonnet filled the air,"
4797,XVII,"Russian, Turk, and Mexican,"
4798,XVII,Folks in India and Japan!
4799,XVII,
4800,XVII,Betsy Bounce has her desire:
4801,XVII,All the world can now admire!
4802,XVII,Yet perhaps she will not pout
4803,XVII,When the bonnet is worn out.
4804,XVII,
4805,XVII,"But her parents, being poor,"
4806,XVII,"Cannot, for a time, procure"
4807,XVII,"Betsy Bounce another hat,"
4808,XVII,So she must keep on with that.

5206,I,With a girl who fully returned his passion.
5207,I,
5208,I,"But she had a father who said, “No, no!"
5209,I,What! marry a boy named Cicero?
5210,I,"Never, with my consent, my dear!”--"

5225,II,
5226,II,"St. James’s Hall, in Regent Street,"
5227,II,For these orations he said was meet;
5228,II,The first oration that he spoke
5229,II,Two dozen heard it--what a joke!
5230,II,
5231,II,"The next time ten, the next time four,"
5232,II,And then the public came no more;
5233,II,But Cicero Brick--_this_ who shall blame?--
5234,II,Spoke the oration all the same.
5235,II,
5236,II,"“Read my advertisement,” quoth he,"

5247,III,So persevering an orator!”
5248,III,
5249,III,"The lover spoke, perhaps with grace,"
5250,III,For two hours in that empty place!
5251,III,The servants at the Hall let out
5252,III,"The fact, and it got noised about"
5253,III,
5254,III,"At concerts, balls, and conversations,"
5255,III,That Cicero spoke these orations
5256,III,"In that huge Hall, week after week,"
5257,III,With no one there to hear him speak.
5258,III,
5259,III,"What was the consequence? A run,"
5260,III,"A rush, to see and hear it done;"
5261,III,“We really _must_ hear Cicero Brick!”
5262,III,All London cried. The crowd was thick.
5263,III,
5264,III,They mobbed the men who took the pay;
5265,III,Hundreds that night were turned away;
5266,III,And Cicero Brick spoke this oration
5267,III,To an enormous congregation!
5268,III,
5269,III,The father of the girl he wooed
5270,III,"Now kept his promise, as he should;"
5271,III,The wedding feast of Cicero Brick

5645,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,The beast was something of that nature.
5646,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5647,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing bulrushes, sing cats and leeks,"
5648,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing tawny gods with senseless beaks,"
5649,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing scarabæi, if you’ve patience,"
5650,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Isis, Osiris, inundations!"
5651,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5652,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"The fiddler raised his violin,"
5653,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,And to perform did next begin--
5654,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing lotus-flower, papyrus stiff,"
5655,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Sarcophagus and hieroglyph!
5656,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5657,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"The district, since Amenophis,"
5658,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Had never heard the like of this;
5659,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"(Oh, to have seen the fiddler man"
5660,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,As up and down the scale he ran!)
5661,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5662,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"That crocodile sat down to hear,"
5663,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,And to his eye there came a tear;
5664,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,He turned it over in his mind;
5665,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,His tail lay limp and long behind.
5666,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5667,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,_Affettuoso_ was the plan
5668,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Which struck at first that fiddler man;
5669,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,_Allegro_ next--his soul was stirr’d--
5670,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,_Con molto brio_ was the word.
5671,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5672,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,At this the alligator brute--
5673,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Or crocodile, if that will suit--"
5674,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Rose, much excited, from his seat,"
5675,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"And danced like mad, with heart and heat."
5676,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5677,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Pompey, plectrum, strings and pegs,"
5678,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Ichneumons, sand, and serpents’ eggs,"
5679,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Cheops, Cephrenes, Memnon, Sphinx--"
5680,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,“I _knew_ it!”--so that fiddler thinks.
5681,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5682,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"“I knew,” said he, with joy and jest,"
5683,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,“That music soothes the savage breast;”
5684,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He swept the strings with maddening go,"
5685,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,From _presto_ to _prestissimo_.
5686,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5687,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,But though the brute had dropped his plan
5688,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Of eating up at once the man,"
5689,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"It did not seem, his ways were such,"
5690,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,That music yet had soothed him much.
5691,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5692,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,In fact he leapt and danced like mad;
5693,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,He danced with all the legs he had;
5694,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Our friend, with violin to shoulder,"
5695,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sat, proudly playing, on a boulder."
5696,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5697,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He played until his arm grew weak,"
5698,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,And heat-drops gathered on his cheek;
5699,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,He saw there would be mischief in it
5700,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,If he but dropped his bow a minute!
5701,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5702,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,For in that alligator’s look
5703,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He read, as plain as in a book,"
5704,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"“Play on, or I will eat you yet,"
5705,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,With appetite the sharper set!”
5706,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5707,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Just as he thought he soon must faint
5708,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,(And his emotions who can paint?)
5709,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He felt, and saw on looking round,"
5710,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,A curious trembling of the ground.
5711,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5712,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Thinks he, “This dancing crocodile"
5713,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Is shaking up the land of Nile”--
5714,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He looked again, and saw, in places,"
5715,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,The pyramids leap from their bases!
5716,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5717,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"As six or seven together rushed,"
5718,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He cried, “Confound it! I am crushed!”"
5719,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"But, happy chance! a moment later"
5720,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,They fell and crushed the alligator.
5721,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5722,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Cleopatra’s almond eye,"
5723,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing reeds and hippopotami,"
5724,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing tamarisk-trees by Mœris Lake,"
5725,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,And mud left in the sun to bake!
5726,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5727,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Then, as the fiddler wiped his brow,"
5728,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Says he, “I feel exhausted now!”"
5729,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Those ruins he no more regards
5730,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Than any fallen house of cards.
5731,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5732,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Out on the sands he chanced to find
5733,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"A bit of temple to his mind,"
5734,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"And, as he sat down in the shade,"
5735,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,There came an Ethiop to his aid.
5736,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5737,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"“De Hyksos,” said that nigger lad,"
5738,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,“Dis way some secret cellarage had;
5739,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Yah, massa, yah, de best ob wine;"
5740,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"De Shepherd Kings, dey know’d de Rhine.”"
5741,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5742,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"He quaffed those hocks, that fiddler bold,"
5743,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Hocks five and thirty centuries old;
5744,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,The cellar-man was older still--
5745,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Typhon, Ptah, or what you will."
5746,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,
5747,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Ra, sing Sos, sing Seb, sing Khem,"
5748,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Mycerinus, after them;"
5749,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Sing Diodorus Siculus,"
5750,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,"Who tells untruths, for all his fuss;"
5751,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,Sing Manetho; but keep this clue--
5752,THE FIDDLER AND THE CROCODILE,The tale which _I_ have told is true.
