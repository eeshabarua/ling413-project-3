35,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.
36,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
37,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
38,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Why should our garments, made to hide"
39,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Our parents' shame, provoke our pride?"
40,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,The art of dress did ne'er begin
41,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.
42,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
43,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"When first she put the covering on,"
44,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Her robe of innocence was gone;
45,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,And yet her children vainly boast
46,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,In the sad marks of glory lost.
47,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
48,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,How proud we are! how fond to shew
49,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Our clothes, and call them rich and new,"
50,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,When the poor sheep and silkworms wore
51,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,That very clothing long before!
52,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
53,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,The tulip and the butterfly
54,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Appear in gayer coats than I:
55,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Let me be dress'd fine as I will,"
56,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still."
57,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
58,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Then will I set my heart to find
59,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Inward adornings of the mind;
60,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace,"
61,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,These are the robes of richest dress.
62,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
63,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"No more shall worms with me compare,"
64,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,This is the raiment angels wear:
65,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"The Son of God, when here below,"
66,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,Put on this blest apparel too.
67,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
68,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"It never fades, it ne'er grows old,"
69,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould:"
70,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"It takes no spot, but still refines;"
71,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"The more 'tis worn, the more it shines."
72,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,
73,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"In this on earth would I appear,"
74,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"Then go to heaven, and wear it there:"
75,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,God will approve it in his sight;
76,AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.,"'Tis his own work, and his delight."

86,THE SLUGGARD.,"'Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain,"
87,THE SLUGGARD.,'You have waked me too soon! I must slumber again!'
88,THE SLUGGARD.,"As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed"
89,THE SLUGGARD.,"Turn his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head."
90,THE SLUGGARD.,
91,THE SLUGGARD.,"'A little more sleep, and a little more slumber!'"
92,THE SLUGGARD.,Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number;
93,THE SLUGGARD.,"And when he gets up he sits folding his hands,"
94,THE SLUGGARD.,"Or walks about sauntering, or trifling he stands."
95,THE SLUGGARD.,
96,THE SLUGGARD.,"I pass'd by his garden, and saw the wild brier,"
97,THE SLUGGARD.,"The thorn, and the thistle grow broader and higher;"
98,THE SLUGGARD.,The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags;
99,THE SLUGGARD.,"And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs."
100,THE SLUGGARD.,
101,THE SLUGGARD.,"I made him a visit, still hoping to find"
102,THE SLUGGARD.,He had took better care for improving his mind:
103,THE SLUGGARD.,"He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking;"
104,THE SLUGGARD.,"But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking."
105,THE SLUGGARD.,
106,THE SLUGGARD.,"Said I then to my heart, 'Here's a lesson for me!"
107,THE SLUGGARD.,That man's but a picture of what I might be;
108,THE SLUGGARD.,"But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding,"
109,THE SLUGGARD.,Who have taught me by times to love working and reading!'

136,"THE ANT, OR EMMET.","When death or old age shall once stare in my face,"
137,"THE ANT, OR EMMET.","What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days,"
138,"THE ANT, OR EMMET.",If I trifle away all their prime!

159,INNOCENT PLAY.,
160,INNOCENT PLAY.,"If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud;"
161,INNOCENT PLAY.,"Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood:"
162,INNOCENT PLAY.,So foul and so fierce are their natures;
163,INNOCENT PLAY.,"But Thomas and William, and such pretty names,"
164,INNOCENT PLAY.,"Should be cleanly and harmless as doves or as lambs,"
165,INNOCENT PLAY.,Those lovely sweet innocent creatures.
166,INNOCENT PLAY.,
167,INNOCENT PLAY.,"Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say,"
168,INNOCENT PLAY.,"Should injure another in jesting or play,"
