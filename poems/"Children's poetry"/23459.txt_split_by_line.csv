123,CHAPTER I.,"""If you please 'm, the children have all run away!"""
124,CHAPTER I.,
125,CHAPTER I.,"""Oh! bother those children--well, first let us look"

139,CHAPTER I.,
140,CHAPTER I.,"""This is really too bad,"" says Mama, in a rage,"
141,CHAPTER I.,As she slips on her pattens and turns down the page
142,CHAPTER I.,"Of the book she is reading, and starts out to find"
143,CHAPTER I.,"The darlings, to give them a piece of her mind!"
144,CHAPTER I.,
145,CHAPTER I.,"She takes a big stick and makes tracks for the sea,"
146,CHAPTER I.,Where she's pretty well sure all the truants will be;
147,CHAPTER I.,"Yama-Guchi, she knows, leads the Twins by the nose,"

153,CHAPTER I.,[Illustration]
154,CHAPTER I.,
155,CHAPTER I.,"Sure enough, the first things that she sees on the shore"
156,CHAPTER I.,"Are footprints, and further on several more--"
157,CHAPTER I.,And still further on there are two little rows

159,CHAPTER I.,
160,CHAPTER I.,But where are the children? The children are _gone_!!
161,CHAPTER I.,Oh! doesn't poor Mistress O'Hara take on!
162,CHAPTER I.,"She weeps and she wails and she tears out her hair,"
163,CHAPTER I.,And rolls on the sands in the depths of despair.
164,CHAPTER I.,
165,CHAPTER I.,"The sand it is gritty, the sand it is dry,"
166,CHAPTER I.,It scratches her nose and gets into her eye;
167,CHAPTER I.,"Her throat feels as if she had swallowed a peck,"

173,CHAPTER I.,[Illustration]
174,CHAPTER I.,
175,CHAPTER I.,"So she picks up her pattens, her stick and her fan,"
176,CHAPTER I.,And bundles her hair up as well as she can.
177,CHAPTER I.,Next minute it all stands on end with surprise:
178,CHAPTER I.,"She stares and she stares, disbelieving her eyes--"
179,CHAPTER I.,
180,CHAPTER I.,"For there, as if just newly dropped from the skies,"
181,CHAPTER I.,"Are the children, all looking as chirpy as flies;"
182,CHAPTER I.,But what flabbergasts the poor lady the most
183,CHAPTER I.,"Is the sight of a MER-BABY, dumped on a post."
184,CHAPTER I.,
185,CHAPTER I.,"Such a queer little object she never has seen,"
186,CHAPTER I.,"It has eyes big as saucers, all glazy and green;"

189,CHAPTER I.,
190,CHAPTER I.,Yama-Guchi is dancing and shouting with glee--
191,CHAPTER I.,"""Did you come from the earth, or the sky, or the sea?"""
192,CHAPTER I.,"While the Twins, with amazement struck utterly dumb,"

200,CHAPTER I.,"They implore it to speak, but they are not prepared"
201,CHAPTER I.,"For the size of its mouth, and are horribly scared;"
202,CHAPTER I.,Making sure it is going to swallow them all--
203,CHAPTER I.,Yet its voice when it speaks is quite squeaky and small.
204,CHAPTER I.,
205,CHAPTER I.,"""My name's Fishy-Winkle--I live in the sea,"
206,CHAPTER I.,"To-day I played truant from school, for a spree;"
207,CHAPTER I.,"But, oh! how I wish that I never had come,"
208,CHAPTER I.,"For the tide has gone out and I cannot get home."""
209,CHAPTER I.,
210,CHAPTER I.,"""Cheer up, Fishy-Winkle, and don't make a fuss,"
211,CHAPTER I.,Get into the go-cart and run off with us;
212,CHAPTER I.,"We've rations for dinner and also for tea,"
213,CHAPTER I.,"You will find it _much_ nicer than under the sea."""
214,CHAPTER I.,
215,CHAPTER I.,They bring up the go-cart and Fishy jumps down.
216,CHAPTER I.,"""The more haste, the less speed,"" for he falls on his crown;"
217,CHAPTER I.,"No matter, he's in now; they're off and--Houp La!"

233,CHAPTER II.,"With Yama-Guchi yoked in front,"
234,CHAPTER II.,A Twin on either hand!
235,CHAPTER II.,
236,CHAPTER II.,"But soon each weary back is humped,"
237,CHAPTER II.,And bowed each jetty pate;
238,CHAPTER II.,"For Fishy, though he looks so small,"
239,CHAPTER II.,Is _not_ a feather-weight!
240,CHAPTER II.,
241,CHAPTER II.,"At last they reach a cavern cool,"
242,CHAPTER II.,"And sit down in a bunch,"
243,CHAPTER II.,"Declaring they won't budge an inch,"
244,CHAPTER II.,Till they have had some lunch.
245,CHAPTER II.,
246,CHAPTER II.,"The food-stuffs are a trifle mixed,"

265,CHAPTER II.,

279,CHAPTER II.,[Illustration]
280,CHAPTER II.,
281,CHAPTER II.,"But nothing daunted, up they get,"
282,CHAPTER II.,And cling with might and main;

284,CHAPTER II.,Con-si-der-able pain!
285,CHAPTER II.,
286,CHAPTER II.,"They joggled for a mile or more,"

289,CHAPTER II.,"A game of Blind Man's Buff."""
290,CHAPTER II.,
291,CHAPTER II.,"That _was_ a game, the children shrieked"

294,CHAPTER II.,However hard he tried.
295,CHAPTER II.,
296,CHAPTER II.,"He chased them up, he chased them down,"

310,CHAPTER II.,
311,CHAPTER II.,"The frogs were shiny, fat and green;"
