27,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
28,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"The late Dr. John Torrey, of Columbia College, was extremely fond of"
29,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"pets, and expressed admiration for the pretty little Brazilian monkeys"
30,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"with gentle, human faces and velvety, mouse-colored coats. A gentleman"
31,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"who heard it went shortly afterward to Brazil. Upon his return, he"
32,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"presented the doctor with a choice pair. A cage was provided for them,"
33,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"and they soon became members of the family, petted by all, and tenderly"
34,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"loved by the doctor, in whose study they lived."
35,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
36,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"One Sunday, the entire family went to church and the monkeys were left"
37,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,at home in their cage. When the churchgoers returned they found the
38,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"stay-at-homes on the top of the folding doors of the parlors, trembling"
39,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"and crying piteously—and for reasons, as they soon discovered. The"
40,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"little mischief-makers had forced open the door of their cage, and,"
41,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"finding themselves free, had proceeded to enjoy themselves in a manner"
42,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,that was scandalous.
43,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
44,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,[Illustration]
45,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
46,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,In the cellar a bag of hops and ten baskets of strawberries were dumped
47,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"together and hopelessly mixed; the pans of milk were without cream, and"
48,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,there was unmistakable evidence that the monkeys had skimmed them with
49,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"their tails! A cistern in the yard offered a fine opening, and the"
50,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"little mischiefs gathered some clothes from the line, the cook’s aprons"
51,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"from the kitchen, and plumped them all in."
52,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
53,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,An open watch belonging to a daughter of the house attracted one of the
54,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"monkeys. He removed the hands, took it down stairs and carefully covered"
55,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"the face with mud, and then brought it back and placed it on her bed."
56,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"Not so carefully did they pull the cover from her writing table,"
57,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"bringing ink and papers with it, and spilling the ink; and when it came"
58,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"to the pulling down of muslin curtains and bed hangings, and tearing"
59,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"them into strips, the fun must have risen to frenzy, for they proceeded"
60,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,to do up the parlor window draperies in the same style. The dining room
61,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"table next engaged their attention, and the fact that they made a salad"
62,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"of the flowers in the center with the pepper, salt, and mustard may have"
63,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,accounted for their tearful state when they were found perched above the
64,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,door.
65,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
66,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"The little penitents were forgiven, for they seemed really sorry. But"
67,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,soon afterward one of the midgets carefully removed the glasses from the
68,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"doctor’s spectacles, twisted the bows and put them in the stove, from"
69,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,which they both took ashes and sprinkled round the room. Fortunately
70,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"there was no fire in the stove, for the next thing in order was the"
71,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"discovery of a gross of matches, which they scattered over the floor."
72,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,
73,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"This began to look like danger, so the doctor was obliged to sell them"
74,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,"to Mr. Barnum. But, whenever he went to visit them, as he often did,"
75,A TALE OF TWO MONKEYS.,they greeted him with unmistakable signs of delight and affection.

84,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,
85,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,What is the most beautiful Christmas story in the world? It is found in
86,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Matthew tells the story of the wise men
87,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and the star, and Luke of the shepherds and the angels; and Luke’s story"
88,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"is the longest, but together they make the most wonderful story that"
89,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"ever was written. It is a great truth, so great that we cannot learn it"
90,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"all, and the heart of that truth is love. God our Father is a great"
91,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Spirit, filling the earth and heavens, and we, his children, are spirits"
92,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"made in his likeness, living in earthly bodies, and he has made all"
93,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"things that are. When his children were forgetting their Father, and"
94,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"losing their likeness to him, he so loved them that he said, “I will go"
95,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"down and live among them, and teach them how to live and how to love.”"
96,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"So he began to live just as we all begin to live in this world, by being"
97,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"a helpless little child. He was first loved by Mary, the mother, and"
98,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"then Joseph and the shepherds, and the wise men all adored him."

104,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"As he grew up many wondered at his words, and loved him so much that"
105,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,they left all to follow him. At last he laid down his life for us all.
106,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"Then his children began to understand who he was and how he loved them,"
107,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"and many gladly suffered and died for his sake, and the story of the"
108,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"holy Child is now read by those who love him around the whole world, and"
109,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"they now begin to understand his words when he said, “I and my Father"
110,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,are one.” Is not this the most beautiful Christmas story in the world?

114,THE OLDEST CHRISTMAS STORY.,"And the hero of this great Christmas story still lives in heaven, and"

121,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.
122,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
123,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
124,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,A dentist tells this story of an elephant that belonged to a circus. He
125,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"was very good-natured, but one day when his keeper went near him he made"
126,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,a vicious switch at him with his trunk.
127,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
128,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,The keeper knew the elephant so well that he said at once that the
129,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,elephant was sick; something was the matter with him. He sat at a safe
130,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,distance from the elephant and watched him.
131,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
132,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"The elephant trumpeted loud and acted as though he was very angry, but"
133,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,no one could decide what was the cause of the change in this good
134,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,elephant’s disposition. This continued for three days. At the end of
135,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"that time one of the men said, “Why, when Jack” (that was the elephant’s"
136,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,name) “lies down he keeps rubbing one side of his head; I think he has
137,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"got the toothache;” and everybody immediately said, “Yes, that’s what’s"
138,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,the matter.”
139,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
140,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,[Illustration]
141,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
142,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"The elephant was chained safely to posts and iron rings, so that he"
143,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"could not move, and the dentist was sent for. The dentist looked in his"
144,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"mouth and saw that one tooth was badly decayed. He touched it, and the"
145,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,elephant trumpeted as though in great pain; then the dentist went to
146,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,work and filled the tooth.
147,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
148,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,After a time the elephant seemed to understand that the dentist was
149,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"trying to do something for his pain, and he gave every evidence of"
150,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,appreciating the attention. Some weeks later the dentist visited the
151,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,winter quarters of the elephant and the elephant recognized him. It was
152,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"rather an expensive operation, for it cost one hundred dollars to fill"
153,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"that one tooth. Doubtless, then, the elephant’s toothache is a larger"
154,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,ache than either you or I ever know when our teeth ache.
155,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,
156,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,"There is an old story, something like this, about a lion which showed"
157,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,gratitude to a man who had taken a thorn out of his foot. Do you
158,THE ELEPHANT’S TOOTHACHE.,remember it?

194,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,"bushy-tailed creature as this. The ant-bear hasn’t a tooth in his head,"
195,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,"and any little Goldilocks might eat his porridge, sit in his chair, and"
196,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,lie in his bed as long as she pleased without being afraid of him. The
197,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,Creator has given to the ant-bear a taste for insects—he prefers
198,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,ants—and has fitted him with a long and prying snout. Out of his mouth
199,A CURIOUS KIND OF BEAR.,"he can dart a very long, threadlike tongue, which is so sticky that the"

217,ROVER IN CHURCH.,
218,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"’Twas a Sunday morning early in May,"
219,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"A beautiful, sunny, quiet day,"
220,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"And all the village, old and young,"
221,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Had trooped to the church when the church bell rung.
222,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"The windows were open, and breezes sweet"
223,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Fluttered the hymn books from seat to seat.
224,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Even the birds in the pale-leaved birch
225,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Sang as softly as if in church!
226,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Right in the midst of the minister’s prayer
227,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"There came a knock at the door. “Who’s there,"
228,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"I wonder?” the gray-haired sexton thought,"
229,ROVER IN CHURCH.,As his careful ear the tapping caught.
230,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Rap, rap, rap, rap—a louder sound."
231,ROVER IN CHURCH.,The boys on the back seats turned around.
232,ROVER IN CHURCH.,What could it mean? for never before
233,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Had anyone knocked at the old church door.
234,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Again the tapping, and now so loud,"
235,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"The minister paused (though his head was bowed),"
236,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Rappety-rap! This will never do;
237,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"The girls are peeping, and laughing too!"
238,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"So the sexton tripped o’er the creaking floor,"
239,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Lifted the latch, and opened the door."
240,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"In there trotted a big black dog,"
241,ROVER IN CHURCH.,As big as a bear! With a solemn jog
242,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Right up the center aisle he pattered;
243,ROVER IN CHURCH.,People might stare—it little mattered.
244,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Straight he went to a little maid,"
245,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Who blushed and hid, as though afraid,"
246,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"And there sat down, as if to say,"
247,ROVER IN CHURCH.,“I’m sorry that I was late to-day;
248,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"But better late than never, you know."
249,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Besides, I waited an hour or so,"
250,ROVER IN CHURCH.,And couldn’t get them to open the door

252,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"Now, little mistress, I’m going to stay,"

254,ROVER IN CHURCH.,The poor little girl hid her face and cried!
255,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"But the big dog nestled close to her side,"
256,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"And kissed her, dog fashion, tenderly,"
257,ROVER IN CHURCH.,Wondering what the matter could be!
258,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"The dog being large (and the sexton small),"
259,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"He sat through the sermon and heard it all,"
260,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"As solemn and wise as anyone there,"
261,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"With a very dignified, scholarly air!"
262,ROVER IN CHURCH.,"And instead of scolding, the minister said,"
263,ROVER IN CHURCH.,As he laid his hand on the sweet child’s head

282,“LITTLE PETER.”,"sometimes called “Mother Carey’s Chicken,” and follows the ships to get"

284,“LITTLE PETER.”,so he follows the whaling ships for the bits of “blubber” that are

287,“LITTLE PETER.”,a wick through the fat little body and hang them up in their huts to

403,A STORY ABOUT A STARLING.,Now it came to pass one day that the starling got out of his cage and
404,A STORY ABOUT A STARLING.,flew away to enjoy his liberty. The barber was troubled. Joe was the
405,A STORY ABOUT A STARLING.,"life of the shop; many a customer came because he had heard of the bird,"
406,A STORY ABOUT A STARLING.,"and the barber saw his custom falling off. Then, too, he loved the bird,"

452,ORIGIN OF THE NAME PUSSY.,"these people made an idol with the cat’s head, and named it Pasht, the"
453,ORIGIN OF THE NAME PUSSY.,same name they gave to the moon; for the word means “the face of the
454,ORIGIN OF THE NAME PUSSY.,"moon.” That word has been changed to “pas,” or “pus,” and has come at"
455,ORIGIN OF THE NAME PUSSY.,"last to be “puss,” the name which almost everyone gives to the cat. Puss"

744,STORY OF THE CENTURY PLANT.,"at the tip of each great leaf are used by the natives as needles, and"

790,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"“Mrs. Wells, here is your little turkey, and it is dead,” said a pitiful"
791,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"voice. Little Eddie, the ministers son, who was Mrs. Wells’s next-door"
792,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"neighbor, held the limp turkey in his hand as he stood in the door."
793,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
794,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"“O, I’m so sorry,” said kind Mrs. Wells, and Edward went home with a"
795,THE DEAD TURKEY.,troubled face. Something hurt him so.
796,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
797,THE DEAD TURKEY.,“What is the matter with my little boy?” said Eddie’s mother. “All the
798,THE DEAD TURKEY.,sunshine has gone out of his face.”
799,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
800,THE DEAD TURKEY.,Eddie gave a deep sigh; then he looked up. “I’m going to tell you all
801,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"about it, mamma,” he said; “you know Mrs. Wells’s dear little chickies"
802,THE DEAD TURKEY.,and turk-a-lurks? They looked so cunning that I just picked up one
803,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"little turkey and hugged it a little bit, and it was dead. The old"
804,THE DEAD TURKEY.,mother turkey was ’most crazy. I carried the poor little turkey chick to
805,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"Mrs. Wells and told her it was dead, and—and something hurts me so right"
806,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"in here,” and he clasped his little hands over his heart."
807,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
808,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"“Was that all you told Mrs. Wells, Eddie?” asked his mother, gravely."

812,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"“Yes’m,” said Eddie; but a little later she saw him trudging toward Mrs."
813,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"Wells’s door. “I killed your turkey, I squeezed it so hard. Will you"
814,THE DEAD TURKEY.,please to forgive me?” said little Eddie.
815,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
816,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"Mrs. Wells said, “Yes, dear; you didn’t mean to kill it, I know.”"
817,THE DEAD TURKEY.,
818,THE DEAD TURKEY.,When Eddie came home the sunshine was in his face again. “I told her the
819,THE DEAD TURKEY.,"whole truth, mamma, and the hurt is gone,” he said, gleefully."

836,A GENTLEMAN IS FIRST A GENTLE BOY.,"On a crowded trolley car going out of Boston, one evening, an old woman"

838,A GENTLEMAN IS FIRST A GENTLE BOY.,all taken. She was bent with age and was very feeble. Her shabby dress
839,A GENTLEMAN IS FIRST A GENTLE BOY.,"and worn shawl told of her poverty. She carried a large basket, and it"
840,A GENTLEMAN IS FIRST A GENTLE BOY.,seemed to grow heavier and heavier as she changed it from one arm to the

843,A GENTLEMAN IS FIRST A GENTLE BOY.,"The other was a ragged newsboy. Tired from his work, the little fellow’s"

864,THE BROTHERS.,"There was a time when the world was very young, and the first people"

867,THE BROTHERS.,"Cain and Abel, the two sons of Adam and Eve. One was gentle and good,"
868,THE BROTHERS.,"and he kept the flocks. The other, the elder, took care of the ground"
869,THE BROTHERS.,and the fruit trees. When they came to offer their sacrifices Abel
870,THE BROTHERS.,brought a lamb and Cain brought grain and fruit. The Lord looked upon
871,THE BROTHERS.,"the hearts of Cain and Abel, and he saw true worship in Abel’s heart, but"
872,THE BROTHERS.,in the heart of Cain he saw selfishness and sin. So he did not accept
873,THE BROTHERS.,his offering. Then the sin in Cain’s heart rose into his tongue as he
874,THE BROTHERS.,"talked angrily with his brother, and by and by it crept out into his"
875,THE BROTHERS.,"hand, and he struck his brother and killed him. The seed of murder,"
876,THE BROTHERS.,"which is hate, had sprung up quickly in Cain’s heart."
