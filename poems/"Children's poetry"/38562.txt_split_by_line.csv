63,_INTRODUCTION_,
64,_INTRODUCTION_,
65,_INTRODUCTION_,"The very title, Nursery Rhymes, which has come to"
66,_INTRODUCTION_,"be associated with a great body of familiar verse, is in itself"
67,_INTRODUCTION_,sufficient indication of the manner in which that verse has been
68,_INTRODUCTION_,passed down from generation to generation. Who composed the little
69,_INTRODUCTION_,"pieces it is, save in a few cases, impossible to say: some are"
70,_INTRODUCTION_,certainly very old and were doubtless repeated thousands of times
71,_INTRODUCTION_,before their first appearance in print. References to certain
72,_INTRODUCTION_,favourites may be found in the pages of the dramatists of Elizabeth's
73,_INTRODUCTION_,time.
74,_INTRODUCTION_,
75,_INTRODUCTION_,Attempts are sometimes made to read into these Rhymes a deeper
76,_INTRODUCTION_,significance than the obvious and simple one which has accounted for
77,_INTRODUCTION_,"their enduring popularity in the Nursery, but this volume has no"
78,_INTRODUCTION_,"concern with such profound interpretations, any more than have the"
79,_INTRODUCTION_,little people who love the old jingles best.
80,_INTRODUCTION_,
81,_INTRODUCTION_,The earliest known collection of Nursery Rhymes was published about
82,_INTRODUCTION_,"1760 by John Newbery, the first publisher who devoted his attention to"
83,_INTRODUCTION_,"very young readers. In his book, which included songs from the plays"
84,_INTRODUCTION_,"of Shakespeare, some of the Rhymes appeared with titles which sound"
85,_INTRODUCTION_,"strange to our ears; thus ""Ding, Dong, Bell"" was called ""Plato's"
86,_INTRODUCTION_,"Song"", while ""There were Two Birds sat on a Stone"" was ""Aristotle's"
87,_INTRODUCTION_,"Song"". To each Rhyme was appended a moral maxim, as for example, to"
88,_INTRODUCTION_,"""Is John Smith within?"" is added ""Knowledge is a treasure, but"
89,_INTRODUCTION_,"practice is the key to it"". Most of the Rhymes in this little Newbery"
90,_INTRODUCTION_,"collection, amongst them ""There was a little Man and he wooed a little"
91,_INTRODUCTION_,"Maid"" and ""The Wise Men of Gotham"", are repeated in the present volume"
92,_INTRODUCTION_,so far as may be in accordance with that early text. Others have been
93,_INTRODUCTION_,compared with early versions in chap-books issued late in the
94,_INTRODUCTION_,eighteenth century or early in the nineteenth.
95,_INTRODUCTION_,
96,_INTRODUCTION_,"Students divide our rhymes into narrative pieces, historical,"
97,_INTRODUCTION_,"folk-lore, game rhymes, counting-out rhymes, jingles, fragments, and"
98,_INTRODUCTION_,"so forth, but for the children for whom and by whom they are"
99,_INTRODUCTION_,"remembered, and for whose sake they are here collected and pictured"
100,_INTRODUCTION_,"anew, they are just--Nursery Rhymes."

524,SIMPLE SIMON,"Then he plunged in above his knees,"
525,SIMPLE SIMON,Which made poor Simon stare.
526,SIMPLE SIMON,
527,SIMPLE SIMON,He went to try if cherries ripe
528,SIMPLE SIMON,Grew upon a thistle;
529,SIMPLE SIMON,"He pricked his finger very much,"
