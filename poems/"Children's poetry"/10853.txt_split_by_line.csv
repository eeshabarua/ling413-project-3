77,PREFACE.,"""OUR GIFT"" has been prepared as a token of affection for our Sunday"
78,PREFACE.,"school Pupils, and it is hoped that it may serve a similar purpose in"
79,PREFACE.,"the hands of other teachers. It has been said, that ""_He who gives his"
80,PREFACE.,"thought, gives a part of himself_."" It was this idea that suggested the"
81,PREFACE.,offering we now bring. We do not claim for it especial excellence. We
82,PREFACE.,are aware that its pages have not uniform merit. When we state that they
83,PREFACE.,"are from the pens of twenty-five different teachers, few of whom are"
84,PREFACE.,"accustomed to write for the public eye, we offer the only apology for"
85,PREFACE.,"the imperfections of the work, which, in our judgment, the circumstances"
86,PREFACE.,of the case demand. If this explanation shall not cause the critic to
87,PREFACE.,"throw the work aside, we would welcome him to whatever pleasure he may"
88,PREFACE.,"find in its perusal. Of the defects which it contains, we prefer to"
89,PREFACE.,"share jointly the responsibility; and have, therefore, omitted to attach"
90,PREFACE.,"signatures to the several articles. The shorter paragraphs, scattered"
91,PREFACE.,"through the work, embody ideas from several contributions which have"
92,PREFACE.,"been excluded by its narrow limits. Such as it is, we present it to the"
93,PREFACE.,"public generally, and especially to our pupils, as a slight token of the"
94,PREFACE.,"ardent love we bear them, humbly praying that the moral lessons it"
95,PREFACE.,"contains may find a place in their hearts, and contribute to the"
96,PREFACE.,formation of such a character as involves within itself the highest form
97,PREFACE.,of blessing.

201,CONVERSATION I.,"""Well, Clara,"" said Mary, as they left the church, ""shall we go now and"
202,CONVERSATION I.,"take a walk before we go home? Look, there are William Johnson and"
203,CONVERSATION I.,"George Field waiting to see which way we shall turn, in order to"
204,CONVERSATION I.,"accompany us."""
205,CONVERSATION I.,
206,CONVERSATION I.,"""Not this afternoon,"" answered Clara, ""I think we had better go home."""
207,CONVERSATION I.,
208,CONVERSATION I.,They continued their way homeward until they reached the street where
209,CONVERSATION I.,"Clara lived, and were about to part, when Mary asked her companion at"
210,CONVERSATION I.,"what time she would meet her the next morning to take a long walk,"
211,CONVERSATION I.,adding that William and George would go with them.
212,CONVERSATION I.,
213,CONVERSATION I.,"""I will ask mother,"" replied Clara, ""and if she is willing, I will meet"
214,CONVERSATION I.,"you at six o'clock."""
215,CONVERSATION I.,
216,CONVERSATION I.,"""How is this,"" said Mary, ""you never used to say you would ask your"
217,CONVERSATION I.,"mother; besides, there can be no possible objection to our going to take"
218,CONVERSATION I.,"a walk."""
219,CONVERSATION I.,
220,CONVERSATION I.,"""True,"" rejoined Clara, ""there can be no objection to our taking a walk;"
221,CONVERSATION I.,but we have never told our mothers that William and George are in the
222,CONVERSATION I.,"habit of going with us."""
223,CONVERSATION I.,
224,CONVERSATION I.,"""Well, I don't see any _great_ harm in their going with us,"" continued"
225,CONVERSATION I.,"Mary, with a tone which indicated that she did not see _any_ harm"
226,CONVERSATION I.,_whatever_ in it.
227,CONVERSATION I.,
228,CONVERSATION I.,"""Perhaps there is not, and yet, Mary, I have thought that there might"
229,CONVERSATION I.,"be; therefore, I prefer to speak to my mother about it."""
230,CONVERSATION I.,
231,CONVERSATION I.,"""And pray, Miss Clara, what has made you so conscientious all at once?"""
232,CONVERSATION I.,
233,CONVERSATION I.,"""I will tell you, Mary. You recollect that on the last Sabbath, our"
234,CONVERSATION I.,"pastor took for his text, the fifth commandment."""
235,CONVERSATION I.,
236,CONVERSATION I.,"""Yes, I do."""
237,CONVERSATION I.,
238,CONVERSATION I.,"""Well, something which he said, caused me to think more about these"
239,CONVERSATION I.,"words than I ever did before; and the more I think of them, the more"
240,CONVERSATION I.,"convinced I am, that we do not consider and reflect upon them so much as"
241,CONVERSATION I.,"we ought to."""
242,CONVERSATION I.,
243,CONVERSATION I.,"""Let me see,"" said Mary, ""Honor thy father and thy mother;""--""Well, I"
244,CONVERSATION I.,am sure I do honor my father and my mother; I obey them when they give
245,CONVERSATION I.,"me a command, and I love them with all my heart. What more can I do?"""
246,CONVERSATION I.,
247,CONVERSATION I.,"""So I reasoned before, but when I sat down alone in my chamber, a good"
248,CONVERSATION I.,"many things came to my mind, to convince me that I was wrong."""
249,CONVERSATION I.,
250,CONVERSATION I.,"""Well,"" added Mary, ""let me have the benefit of your reflections."""
251,CONVERSATION I.,
252,CONVERSATION I.,"""Why, in this very instance of going to walk, I had always asked my"
253,CONVERSATION I.,"mother's consent, and she had given it; but I never told her where we"
254,CONVERSATION I.,"went, or who went with us, which now appears to me wrong. Our mothers"
255,CONVERSATION I.,"are much older than we are, and have had much more experience than we"
256,CONVERSATION I.,"have, and there _may_ be wrong in doing what appears to us quite"
257,CONVERSATION I.,"harmless."""
258,CONVERSATION I.,
259,CONVERSATION I.,"""For the life of me,"" interrupted Mary, ""I cannot think there can"
260,CONVERSATION I.,"possibly be any harm in such a slight occurrence. However, say nothing"
261,CONVERSATION I.,"to your mother to-night; but go with us to-morrow morning, and then you"
262,CONVERSATION I.,"can mention it to her, and see what she says."""
263,CONVERSATION I.,
264,CONVERSATION I.,"""I beg your pardon, Mary; but you said just now, you could not see what"
265,CONVERSATION I.,"possible harm there could be in so slight an occurrence, and yet your"
266,CONVERSATION I.,"request to put off mentioning this to my mother, shows that you have"
267,CONVERSATION I.,"some misgivings on the subject."""
268,CONVERSATION I.,
269,CONVERSATION I.,"Mary reflected for a moment. ""Clara,"" said she, ""if you have no"
270,CONVERSATION I.,"objection, I will go home with you, and hear what your mother will say."""
271,CONVERSATION I.,
272,CONVERSATION I.,"""I shall be delighted to have you,"" was the answer."
273,CONVERSATION I.,
274,CONVERSATION I.,Mary Winthrop and Clara Spaulding had arrived at the ages of fourteen
275,CONVERSATION I.,"and fifteen years, a time of life which is peculiarly critical for"
276,CONVERSATION I.,"girls. At no age do they more require the advice of a mother, and at no"
277,CONVERSATION I.,age are they less inclined to seek it. This would seem to be a natural
278,CONVERSATION I.,"disinclination, so prevalent is it. These were both good girls, but, as"
279,CONVERSATION I.,"may be judged from the conversation we have just related, Clara was the"
280,CONVERSATION I.,"more thoughtful, while Mary was very apt to act without much reflection."
281,CONVERSATION I.,"She possessed, however, this noble trait; she was always ready to"
282,CONVERSATION I.,"acknowledge her error, when it was pointed out to her, and would"
283,CONVERSATION I.,endeavor to avoid repeating it.
284,CONVERSATION I.,
285,CONVERSATION I.,Mrs. Spaulding had reached home when the girls entered. She was a woman
286,CONVERSATION I.,"of excellent sense, and a mother indeed to her children. Mary frankly"
287,CONVERSATION I.,told her all the conversation which had passed between Clara and
288,CONVERSATION I.,"herself, and then waited for her opinion."
289,CONVERSATION I.,
290,CONVERSATION I.,"""It makes me truly happy,"" said Mrs. S., ""that you have come to me in"
291,CONVERSATION I.,this free and open manner; and I am very glad that my dear Clara has
292,CONVERSATION I.,"reflected so much upon the text. In itself, there is not much harm in"
293,CONVERSATION I.,"taking a walk with William Johnson and George Field, and yet it is not"
294,CONVERSATION I.,"proper for you to do so, without the knowledge and consent of your"
295,CONVERSATION I.,"parents. William and George are not bad boys, and perhaps would be"
296,CONVERSATION I.,"called by people generally, good ones; still, I have remarked a certain"
297,CONVERSATION I.,"levity in their manner, which if only occasional, might be called good"
298,CONVERSATION I.,"humor, but which, recurring as it does at all times and on all"
299,CONVERSATION I.,"occasions, the Sabbath not excepted, makes me fear that their training"
300,CONVERSATION I.,"at home is not what I should desire to have it. For this reason, Mary, I"
301,CONVERSATION I.,"am not willing that Clara should be often in their company, nor do I"
302,CONVERSATION I.,"think your mother would differ from me, should you ask her."""
303,CONVERSATION I.,
304,CONVERSATION I.,"""I wonder,"" said Mary, ""how Clara came to think of this slight"
305,CONVERSATION I.,"circumstance of a walk, in connection with the commandment, 'Honor thy"
306,CONVERSATION I.,"father and thy mother.'"""
307,CONVERSATION I.,
308,CONVERSATION I.,"""I thought she had sufficiently explained that, herself,"" replied Mrs."
309,CONVERSATION I.,"Spaulding. ""I wish both of you, and not only you, but all young persons,"
310,CONVERSATION I.,would think a good deal more on this subject. I remember when I was of
311,CONVERSATION I.,"your age, that many things occurred which I omitted to mention to my"
312,CONVERSATION I.,"mother, but which it would have been much better for me, if I had told"
313,CONVERSATION I.,"her. Sometimes these concerned my bodily health, and I am sure that if I"
314,CONVERSATION I.,"had informed her of them at the time, I should now have a much better"
315,CONVERSATION I.,"constitution than I possess. At other times, I neglected to ask her"
316,CONVERSATION I.,advice about what I thought were small matters; but the result proved
317,CONVERSATION I.,"that I should have been saved much trouble had I consulted her."""
318,CONVERSATION I.,
319,CONVERSATION I.,"""In fact,"" continued Mrs. S., ""the command to honor thy father and thy"
320,CONVERSATION I.,"mother, is far more comprehensive, and exacts many more duties, than the"
321,CONVERSATION I.,"young, and, I am sorry to say, the old too, are willing to recognize."
322,CONVERSATION I.,"The young are too apt to think, when they get into their teens, that"
323,CONVERSATION I.,there are a great many things about which there is no need of asking
324,CONVERSATION I.,"their parents' advice and counsel; that they know, _then, about_ as well"
325,CONVERSATION I.,"as their parents what they ought to do; and, by the time they get to be"
326,CONVERSATION I.,"eighteen or nineteen years of age, _a good deal better_. But, my dear"
327,CONVERSATION I.,"children, it is not so. And the young who reason and act thus, will soon"
328,CONVERSATION I.,"cease to honor their father and mother. No! The Almighty Father, in"
329,CONVERSATION I.,"giving this as one of the ten commandments to the children of Israel,"
330,CONVERSATION I.,knew the vanity of our nature. He knew how unwilling the young are to
331,CONVERSATION I.,"learn from the experience of the old, and he therefore proclaimed this"
332,CONVERSATION I.,"command, that they might have it constantly before their eyes."
333,CONVERSATION I.,
334,CONVERSATION I.,"""I have said, this is a comprehensive command. To honor thy father and"
335,CONVERSATION I.,thy mother is not merely to show them outward respect. It embraces
336,CONVERSATION I.,"numberless duties, and among them this; the duty, while you are young,"
337,CONVERSATION I.,"of doing nothing without their knowledge and consent, when you are in a"
338,CONVERSATION I.,situation to ask it.
339,CONVERSATION I.,
340,CONVERSATION I.,"""Be assured of one thing. If you are about to go anywhere, or do"
341,CONVERSATION I.,"anything, and a doubt arises in your mind whether it is necessary to ask"
342,CONVERSATION I.,"your mother's permission, be certain that you ought to ask it. The very"
343,CONVERSATION I.,doubt in your own mind is sufficient evidence of the fact.
344,CONVERSATION I.,
345,CONVERSATION I.,"""Get into the habit of talking with your mother upon every subject; your"
346,CONVERSATION I.,"diversions, your studies, your health. Never conceal anything from her."
347,CONVERSATION I.,Is she not your mother? Did she not give you being? Who then shall you
348,CONVERSATION I.,"look up to, if not to her?"""
349,CONVERSATION I.,
350,CONVERSATION I.,"""O,"" interrupted Mary, ""I have sometimes begun to talk to my mother"
351,CONVERSATION I.,"about many things which I did not exactly understand, but somehow or"
352,CONVERSATION I.,"other she was not willing to answer my questions."""
353,CONVERSATION I.,
354,CONVERSATION I.,"""Perhaps,"" said Mrs. Spaulding, ""you did not take a proper occasion, or"
355,CONVERSATION I.,she may have been very busy about something else. You ought always to
356,CONVERSATION I.,"endeavor to take a proper time for everything. At the same time,"" she"
357,CONVERSATION I.,"continued, ""I am sorry to say that there are some mothers who think"
358,CONVERSATION I.,"children cannot be talked to, and reasoned with, till they are of age."
359,CONVERSATION I.,"This is a mistaken idea. Children have reasoning faculties, and the"
360,CONVERSATION I.,"sooner we begin to converse with them accordingly, the sooner will those"
361,CONVERSATION I.,"faculties be developed. With this view, we ought always to encourage"
362,CONVERSATION I.,"them to give us their confidence on all occasions, gratify their"
363,CONVERSATION I.,"curiosity, and allow them to talk upon every subject to us. If we do not"
364,CONVERSATION I.,"act thus, they will soon abstain from that frank manner with which"
365,CONVERSATION I.,"children ought always to lay open their whole hearts to their parents."""
366,CONVERSATION I.,
367,CONVERSATION I.,"""O yes,"" cried Mary; ""there is Emma Woodbury,--I do not believe she ever"
368,CONVERSATION I.,"asks her mother's advice."""
369,CONVERSATION I.,
370,CONVERSATION I.,"""No,"" said Clara, ""and there is Jane Clifton's mother,--"""
371,CONVERSATION I.,
372,CONVERSATION I.,"""Stop, my dears,"" interrupted Mrs. Spaulding, ""these remarks of yours"
373,CONVERSATION I.,"remind me that there is another subject, about which I should like to"
374,CONVERSATION I.,"have a conversation with you; and if your mother, Mary, will give you"
375,CONVERSATION I.,"permission to come home with Clara, after school to-morrow afternoon, I"
376,CONVERSATION I.,"will tell you what it is."""
377,CONVERSATION I.,
378,CONVERSATION I.,"""O yes, I know she will,"" replied Mary. ""Indeed, yesterday, I should not"
379,CONVERSATION I.,"have thought of asking her; but now, after what I have heard from your"
380,CONVERSATION I.,"lips, I shall not do anything, or go anywhere, without asking her"
381,CONVERSATION I.,"consent."""
382,CONVERSATION I.,
383,CONVERSATION I.,"""I am glad,"" responded Mrs. Spaulding, ""that you remember this lesson so"
384,CONVERSATION I.,"well. Now, Mary, you had better go home; and may neither of you ever"
385,CONVERSATION I.,"think otherwise than seriously, of the divine command, to 'honor thy"
386,CONVERSATION I.,father and thy mother;' and remember that few persons have ever come to
387,CONVERSATION I.,"harm when they grew up, who in their youth obeyed it."""

400,CONVERSATION II.,"Mary's mother cheerfully gave her leave to go home with Clara, the next"

404,CONVERSATION II.,Mrs. Spaulding greeted the girls with a smile and a kind word; then

409,CONVERSATION II.,"asked the advice of her mother, or her consent to do anything or go"
410,CONVERSATION II.,"anywhere; and I know a great many girls who act in the same way."""
411,CONVERSATION II.,
412,CONVERSATION II.,"""And I,"" added Clara, ""intended to say that Jane Clifton's mother was"
413,CONVERSATION II.,"one of those whom you spoke of, as never conversing with children in a"
414,CONVERSATION II.,"rational and reasoning manner."""
415,CONVERSATION II.,
416,CONVERSATION II.,"""I guessed as much,"" said Mrs. Spaulding. ""I told you,"" she continued,"
417,CONVERSATION II.,"""there was another point upon which I wished to say a few words to you."
418,CONVERSATION II.,"Can you think what it is?"""
419,CONVERSATION II.,
420,CONVERSATION II.,"""I cannot,"" said Mary. ""Nor I either,"" said Clara; ""certainly, I see no"
421,CONVERSATION II.,"harm in the words we uttered."""
422,CONVERSATION II.,
423,CONVERSATION II.,"""True,"" responded Mrs. Spaulding, ""there was no harm. It was not the"
424,CONVERSATION II.,"words you spoke, but the tone in which they were spoken, that attracted"
425,CONVERSATION II.,my attention; as if you were _glad_ to be able to point out somebody to
426,CONVERSATION II.,"whom the reproof could be applied. This failing is a common one, and our"
427,CONVERSATION II.,"Savior may have had it in view, when he said to his followers, on the"
428,CONVERSATION II.,"mount, 'Cast out the beam from thine own eye; and then shalt thou see"
429,CONVERSATION II.,"clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.' My object now, my"
430,CONVERSATION II.,"dear children, is to caution you against a failing, which is almost"
431,CONVERSATION II.,"universal, namely, of seeing distinctly and reproving faults in others,"
432,CONVERSATION II.,while we appear to be quite unconscious that we ourselves are in the
433,CONVERSATION II.,practice of the same or worse defects.
434,CONVERSATION II.,
435,CONVERSATION II.,"""This blemish develops itself in a variety of ways. The pastor preaches"
436,CONVERSATION II.,"an excellent sermon, wherein is contained some allusion to faults which"
437,CONVERSATION II.,ought to be corrected. If the people had treasured up in their hearts
438,CONVERSATION II.,"all his exhortations, they would not have forgotten one which he has"
439,CONVERSATION II.,"often endeavored to impress upon their minds; I mean, the duty of"
440,CONVERSATION II.,"self-communion, self-examination; and when he should have occasion to"
441,CONVERSATION II.,"allude to faults, they would, one and all, ask themselves, 'Am I guilty"
442,CONVERSATION II.,"of this wrong? Let me see; and if I am, let me correct it in future.'"
443,CONVERSATION II.,"Instead of this, how frequently do we hear such expressions as these:"
444,CONVERSATION II.,"'The remarks in the sermon this morning applied to Mr. A or Mrs. B, very"
445,CONVERSATION II.,"well, and it is to be hoped they will see it, and profit by it.' Now if"
446,CONVERSATION II.,"such individuals, instead of trying to find others who are guilty of the"
447,CONVERSATION II.,"wrong indicated, would only carefully look within themselves, ten"
448,CONVERSATION II.,chances to one they would find that they deserved the rebuke as much as
449,CONVERSATION II.,any one else.
450,CONVERSATION II.,
451,CONVERSATION II.,"""Children insensibly contract the same bad habit of looking very sharply"
452,CONVERSATION II.,"for the faults of others, never once thinking that they may have some,"
453,CONVERSATION II.,"which, if not precisely the same, may be even worse. Thus if the pastor,"
454,CONVERSATION II.,"superintendent, or one of the teachers, addresses the Sabbath school,"
455,CONVERSATION II.,"calling the attention of the scholars generally to any fault, each"
456,CONVERSATION II.,"scholar ought to ask himself at once, 'Is it I?' and not look round"
457,CONVERSATION II.,"complacently and ask, 'Who _can_ it be?' or say, 'I guess the speaker"
458,CONVERSATION II.,"means to refer to Lilly A or Edgar B.'"""
459,CONVERSATION II.,
460,CONVERSATION II.,"""Well,"" said Mary, ""I must confess that I have done this often, and"
461,CONVERSATION II.,"without being conscious of any wrong feelings; some how or other, I did"
462,CONVERSATION II.,not consider that the reproof belonged to me; or ever ask myself if I
463,CONVERSATION II.,"had committed the fault which was exposed."""
464,CONVERSATION II.,
465,CONVERSATION II.,"""For this reason, I remarked,"" continued Mrs. S., ""that children"
466,CONVERSATION II.,insensibly contract this habit from their parents; and the defect
467,CONVERSATION II.,"extends to physical as well as moral errors. Not long since, I had an"
468,CONVERSATION II.,"interesting conversation with Mr. R., a well-known philanthropist and"
469,CONVERSATION II.,"physiologist, who is devoting his life to the alleviation of some of the"
470,CONVERSATION II.,"ills of human existence. He told me that, a short time before, he"
471,CONVERSATION II.,delivered a lecture to parents on the physical training of their
472,CONVERSATION II.,"children, and pointed out the great mistakes which are often made. On"
473,CONVERSATION II.,"retiring, said he, I overheard many remarks, but not one spoke as if I"
474,CONVERSATION II.,had addressed him. Every one could point to some one else who might well
475,CONVERSATION II.,profit by the lecture; but not one would believe that I meant to say to
476,CONVERSATION II.,"each individual present, as Nathan said unto David, 'Thou art the man.'"""
477,CONVERSATION II.,
478,CONVERSATION II.,"""I am sure,"" observed Clara, ""I never felt the full force of this saying"
479,CONVERSATION II.,"of our Savior before, although I have read it a hundred times. I shall"
480,CONVERSATION II.,"read the whole chapter again, carefully, to-night."""
481,CONVERSATION II.,
482,CONVERSATION II.,"""And so will I,"" added Mary."
483,CONVERSATION II.,
484,CONVERSATION II.,"""Do so, my children,"" said Mrs. S., ""and read in the same careful spirit"
485,CONVERSATION II.,"the whole Sermon on the Mount, and all our Savior's teachings. Many"
486,CONVERSATION II.,"people, old and young, read the New Testament because they are told to,"
487,CONVERSATION II.,"without thinking that there is an active, living principle in it, a"
488,CONVERSATION II.,"thought to be treasured up and carried out in our daily lives, in almost"
489,CONVERSATION II.,every word the Master uttered. Those who _do_ read it in the true
490,CONVERSATION II.,"spirit, find new pleasure and new instruction every time they peruse it."
491,CONVERSATION II.,
492,CONVERSATION II.,"""And finally, to come back to our subject, when you hear your"
493,CONVERSATION II.,"schoolmates making uncharitable remarks about others, use all your"
494,CONVERSATION II.,"influence, especially by your own example, to make them correct the"
495,CONVERSATION II.,"habit. And when you hear a sermon in church, or an address in the"
496,CONVERSATION II.,"school, where any faults are exposed, ask yourselves if the rebuke"
497,CONVERSATION II.,"applies to you; and if it does, set about correcting the fault"
498,CONVERSATION II.,"immediately. Do this always. 'Cast the _beam_ out of thine own eye,'"
499,CONVERSATION II.,"correct your own errors, then will you see clearly to 'cast the _mote_"
500,CONVERSATION II.,"out of thy brother's eye.'"""
501,CONVERSATION II.,
502,CONVERSATION II.,Mary returned home that evening well pleased with the two conversations
503,CONVERSATION II.,"she had taken part in; and better still, she and Clara profited by them."
504,CONVERSATION II.,"I am happy to add, that their schoolmates are gradually correcting many"
505,CONVERSATION II.,evil habits by the good example of these two girls; and thus Mary and
506,CONVERSATION II.,"Clara have the double satisfaction of improving their own conduct, and"
507,CONVERSATION II.,of being instrumental in improving that of others.

759,"THE HUNTER, AND HIS DOG JOWLER.",
760,"THE HUNTER, AND HIS DOG JOWLER.",
761,A FABLE.,A FABLE.
762,A FABLE.,
763,A FABLE.,A famous hunter in the woodland country had a dog which was particularly
764,A FABLE.,"fond of certain kinds of game, but exceedingly averse to other kinds of"
765,A FABLE.,"much better flavor. Now it happened that, whenever the hunter wished to"
766,A FABLE.,"give chase to moose or deer, Jowler was sure to scare up a woodchuck, or"
767,A FABLE.,"some still filthier game, leaving the deer to make good his escape."
768,A FABLE.,
769,A FABLE.,"Day after day thus passed away, leaving the hunter's labors no suitable"
770,A FABLE.,reward. It was in vain that the hunter expostulated with his dog.
771,A FABLE.,Neither threats nor blows were of any avail. When the master would hunt
772,A FABLE.,"one thing, the dog was sure to be hunting something else."
773,A FABLE.,
774,A FABLE.,"At length, both master and dog seemed to tire of their constant"
775,A FABLE.,"conflict, and to desire some adjustment, whereby each might accommodate"
776,A FABLE.,"his own taste to some extent, and yet live in harmony with the other."
777,A FABLE.,"With this view, a friendly conference was held, in which Jowler appeared"
778,A FABLE.,"so tenacious, that the hunter well-nigh despaired of any adjustment"
779,A FABLE.,whatever.
780,A FABLE.,
781,A FABLE.,"It was, however, finally agreed, that Jowler should hunt game to his own"
782,A FABLE.,"taste five days in the week, and devote the remaining hunting day to"
783,A FABLE.,"such game as his master preferred. Jowler, however, was careful to"
784,A FABLE.,"stipulate that, if he chanced to find himself ill, or not in hunting"
785,A FABLE.,"trim, on the sixth day, he should be considerately dealt by, and not"
786,A FABLE.,forced to go beyond his strength.
787,A FABLE.,
788,A FABLE.,"The arrangements being fully made, a paper was drawn up containing the"
789,A FABLE.,"articles of agreement, and both Jowler and the hunter affixed their"
790,A FABLE.,"names thereto. Jowler, no doubt, congratulated himself on having it all"
791,A FABLE.,"to his liking five days out of six; while the hunter, perhaps, flattered"
792,A FABLE.,"himself that the taste of venison one day in the week, would so improve"
793,A FABLE.,"the standard of Jowler's tastes, as to bend him, at length, altogether"
794,A FABLE.,to his own wishes.
795,A FABLE.,
796,A FABLE.,"For a while, things seemed to promise well, under the new arrangement."
797,A FABLE.,"By and by, when the day for hunting venison came round, Jowler was sick,"
798,A FABLE.,and told his master he couldn't hunt that day. So his master very
799,A FABLE.,"considerately excused him, according to the terms of their agreement."
800,A FABLE.,
801,A FABLE.,"It was not long, however, before Jowler refused to hunt for another"
802,A FABLE.,"reason. He said, he had followed his own game with such constancy and"
803,A FABLE.,"alacrity for the five days, that he was too much exhausted to hunt"
804,A FABLE.,venison on the sixth day. He must rest from any farther fatigue; and
805,A FABLE.,"claimed the continued indulgence of his master, by virtue of their"
806,A FABLE.,contract.
807,A FABLE.,
808,A FABLE.,The hunter urged in vain that Jowler had virtually violated the
809,A FABLE.,contract; for although it was stipulated that he should not be compelled
810,A FABLE.,"to the chase to his personal detriment, yet it was implied, of course,"
811,A FABLE.,that he should use the same precaution to be in hunting trim on the
812,A FABLE.,"sixth day, as he did to be so on the other five. While the fact was, he"
813,A FABLE.,"purposely deprived himself of rest during the five days, that he might"
814,A FABLE.,"be compelled to employ the sixth as a day of rest, thus virtually"
815,A FABLE.,appropriating the whole time to his own service.
816,A FABLE.,
817,A FABLE.,"Jowler, however, pretended not to be convinced of his wrong. Nor did his"
818,A FABLE.,"dishonesty stop here. His master soon discovered that, while he was"
819,A FABLE.,"pretending to be unable from his excessive fatigue to hunt venison, he"
820,A FABLE.,"was really continuing to hunt his own game, as on the other five days."
821,A FABLE.,
822,A FABLE.,"Thus did he go on, his old loves gaining strength day by day, and"
823,A FABLE.,impelling him to a total disregard of his contract in order to indulge
824,A FABLE.,"them, until his master would bear with him no longer, but drove him from"
825,A FABLE.,his door.
826,A FABLE.,
827,A FABLE.,"Having deprived himself of the care of so good a master, he soon fell"
828,A FABLE.,"into still greater irregularities; and a neighboring shepherd,"
829,A FABLE.,"suspecting him of committing depredations upon his flock, killed him,"
830,A FABLE.,thus terminating his vicious career.
831,A FABLE.,
832,A FABLE.,"Moral.--Excessive engagedness in worldly labors six days in the week, is"
833,A FABLE.,no sufficient excuse for the neglect of public worship on the seventh;
834,A FABLE.,"and a vicious love, continually indulged, is quite sure to root out even"
835,A FABLE.,our good resolutions.

1009,AGATHA.,Little Agatha was a Sabbath school scholar. She lived in a rural
1010,AGATHA.,district of Scotland. Her father's dwelling was surrounded by trees and
1011,AGATHA.,"flowers, and near by a little sparkling rivulet wandered onward, now"
1012,AGATHA.,"murmuring along by its rocky bed and dancing over bright pebbles, and"
1013,AGATHA.,"now wending its way silently through the valley, journeying onward to"
1014,AGATHA.,mingle with kindred waters.
1015,AGATHA.,
1016,AGATHA.,"Agatha loved to roam through these shady glens, and often would she"
1017,AGATHA.,"stand upon the margin of the little stream, and, gazing down, fancy that"
1018,AGATHA.,she saw a beautiful little angel in the pure waters. She sometimes
1019,AGATHA.,"waited a long time, hoping it might speak to her, little dreaming that"
1020,AGATHA.,her sweet angel was but the reflection of her own innocent face and
1021,AGATHA.,"golden ringlets from the mirrored surface. She loved the little brook,"
1022,AGATHA.,"and walked among the wild flowers upon its banks, herself as pure and"
1023,AGATHA.,innocent as Spring's earliest blossoms. She was never lonely in her
1024,AGATHA.,"rural bowers; for the brook, the birds, and the flowers, ever spoke to"
1025,AGATHA.,her heart in tones of love.
1026,AGATHA.,
1027,AGATHA.,But one day her teacher told her that wicked spirits were ever flying
1028,AGATHA.,"about, trying to lead away little children into their company, and make"
1029,AGATHA.,"them as wicked as themselves. This much disquieted Agatha, for she had"
1030,AGATHA.,never learned before that aught existed save innocence and joy. At
1031,AGATHA.,"first, she feared to wander out alone, into the ""great temple of"
1032,AGATHA.,"nature,"" as she was wont, lest she should meet some of those malicious"
1033,AGATHA.,"beings. She dared not look into the pure waters, fearing that, instead"
1034,AGATHA.,"of the beautiful angel which so often met her gaze, hideous forms might"
1035,AGATHA.,rise and drag her away into their bad company.
1036,AGATHA.,
1037,AGATHA.,"But her heart was soon quieted again; for her teacher also told her,"
1038,AGATHA.,"that good beings come down from the Spirit-land, to watch over little"
1039,AGATHA.,"children, and drive the wicked ones away. So Agatha no longer feared to"
1040,AGATHA.,"visit her favorite haunts, for she besought the good spirits to be her"
1041,AGATHA.,"guardians. And when at night she retired to her little couch, she prayed"
1042,AGATHA.,the kind angels to watch over and protect her from evil spirits. And her
1043,AGATHA.,"prayer was answered, for none but good spirits ever visited the heart of"
1044,AGATHA.,Agatha. She was always punctual at Sabbath school; and one day after
1045,AGATHA.,"looking around in vain for one of her mates, she was very much troubled"
1046,AGATHA.,"to learn that she had been led a long way off, by a company of evil"
1047,AGATHA.,spirits. She longed to tear the unfortunate victim from their grasp; but
1048,AGATHA.,"her teacher told her, that the celestial beings alone could save her,"
1049,AGATHA.,and she must pray to them.
1050,AGATHA.,
1051,AGATHA.,"So Agatha went home, and walked out among the flowers, thinking the"
1052,AGATHA.,"celestial spirits would delight to linger in so pure a spot, and"
1053,AGATHA.,"kneeling amid a cluster of roses, she prayed them to fly to the rescue"
1054,AGATHA.,of her misled companion. And everywhere that Agatha thought pure enough
1055,AGATHA.,"for the abode of the good spirits, would she go and pray that her friend"
1056,AGATHA.,"might be restored. At night she would look up to the stars, and entreat"
1057,AGATHA.,"the same good beings to come down from their pure, bright dwellings, and"
1058,AGATHA.,"lead back the straying one. Her prayers were soon answered, and when she"
1059,AGATHA.,"next went to Sabbath school, she was almost overjoyed to find her little"
1060,AGATHA.,friend at her accustomed place. Little Mary (for she it was who had been
1061,AGATHA.,led away) seemed very happy to get back again. She kissed her
1062,AGATHA.,"schoolmates, and said she would never leave them more. But she told them"
1063,AGATHA.,"a sad tale of Sin-land; how the evil ones would not suffer her to sleep,"
1064,AGATHA.,"lest, in her slumbers, the good spirits might visit her and take her"
1065,AGATHA.,"away;--that they would not let her walk among the flowers, for good"
1066,AGATHA.,"spirits are there. And for a long time they watched her very closely,"
1067,AGATHA.,and directed her steps in their pathway.
1068,AGATHA.,
1069,AGATHA.,"But, at length, when she become faint and weary, the ministering angels"
1070,AGATHA.,"came to her assistance, took her in their arms, and folding her weary"
1071,AGATHA.,"limbs in their white robes, bore her back to her anxious companions. No"
1072,AGATHA.,"one rejoiced more than did Agatha, that the heavenly messengers had led"
1073,AGATHA.,Mary back.
1074,AGATHA.,
1075,AGATHA.,"Their teacher said that her school was a little garden of flowers, which"
1076,AGATHA.,she was rearing for heaven. But Agatha was the most innocent flower
1077,AGATHA.,"there, and ready to bloom in the garden of paradise. The kind heavenly"
1078,AGATHA.,"guides thought her too pure for earth, and they would fain have her"
1079,AGATHA.,companionship in their purer regions. So they bore her away on wings of
1080,AGATHA.,love to their heavenly home.

1437,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"true God: Jesus Christ being the chief Corner Stone. May 19, 1817."" The"
1438,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"building of the house was carried forward with energy, and on the 25th"
1439,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,of August the Chairman of the Committee was directed to address a letter
1440,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"to Rev. Hosea Ballou, asking him if it would meet his approbation to be"
1441,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,considered a candidate for the office of pastor. The house having been
1442,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"completed, it was voted to dedicate the same on Wednesday, October 15,"
1443,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"1817. The Rev. Thomas Jones was invited to preach the sermon, and Revs."
1444,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Edward Turner, Hosea Ballou, and Paul Dean, to conduct the other"
1445,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"services as might be mutually agreeable to them. In consequence,"
1446,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"however, of the Cattle Show at Brighton taking place on that day, it was"
1447,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,afterwards thought expedient to postpone the Dedication until the
1448,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,succeeding day.
1449,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1450,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"On the day following the Dedication, the Society met for the purpose of"
1451,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"selecting a pastor; and the Standing Committee were instructed, by a"
1452,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"unanimous vote, to invite the Rev. Hosea Ballou to that office, at a"
1453,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,weekly salary of twenty-five dollars. This vote was communicated to him
1454,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"in an appropriate letter from the Chairman of the Committee, to which"
1455,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,the following reply was received:--
1456,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1457,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Boston, Oct. 24, 1817."
1458,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1459,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Sir,--The call of the Second Universalist Society in Boston,"
1460,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"inviting me to the labors of the Christian Ministry with them,"
1461,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"together with the liberal terms which accompany said invitation, has"
1462,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,been duly considered. And after weighing all the circumstances
1463,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"relative to the subject, so far as my limited mind could comprehend"
1464,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"them, I have come to the conclusion that it is my duty to accept"
1465,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,their call on the conditions therein stated. I largely participate
1466,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"the ""peculiar pleasure"" afforded by the consideration of the"
1467,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"unanimity of the Society, and entertain an humble hope that, with"
1468,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"the continuance of this harmony, we may long continue to enjoy all"
1469,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus.

1476,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"To John Brazer, Esq."
1477,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1478,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"He was publicly installed on Christmas day, December 25, 1817. Sermon,"
1479,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"from John xx. 24, and the Fellowship of the Churches, were given by Rev."
1480,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Paul Dean; Installing Prayer and Charge by Rev. Edward Turner, and the"
1481,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,Concluding Prayer by Rev. Joshua Flagg.
1482,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1483,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"At the annual meeting in May, 1818, the thanks of the Society were"
1484,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"presented to Lemuel Packard, Jr., Esq., for his generous donation of a"
1485,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,chandelier for the use of the church. The clock now in the church was
1486,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"the gift of John Brazer, Esq., probably during the time of the building"
1487,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,of the church.
1488,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1489,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"In the summer of 1822, Mr. Ballou received an invitation to become the"
1490,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"pastor of the Second Universalist Society in Philadelphia, at a larger"
1491,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"salary than he was then receiving. In a letter to his Society, Mr. B."
1492,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"states, that they are under no engagement to him beyond the term of six"
1493,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"months; and that, his salary being barely sufficient to support his"
1494,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"family, he felt bound to lay the invitation of the Philadelphia Society"
1495,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"before them for their assistance, in any decision he might make in"
1496,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"regard to it. The Society was accordingly called together, and by a"
1497,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,unanimous vote his salary was raised to thirty dollars a week. This vote
1498,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"being communicated to him, he informed them in reply that the salary"
1499,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"voted him was fully and abundantly satisfactory to him, and that he"
1500,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,accepted it with pleasure.
1501,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1502,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"During the year 1836, the Society built the vestry in the attic story of"
1503,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"the church, and the following year, 1837, the interior of the church was"
1504,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"altered by a new pulpit, ceiling, introduction of gas, painting, &c. at"
1505,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"an expense of nearly five thousand dollars. And in the year 1840, the"
1506,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,Society purchased the organ now in the church.
1507,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1508,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"During the first years of the existence of the Society, the singing was"
1509,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,considered of a superior order; and it may be interesting to some of the
1510,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"younger members of the Society to know that, in 1833, the Standing"
1511,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Committee approved of the selection, by the choir, of Miss Charlotte"
1512,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Cushman, as the leading female singer. Mr. Win. Barry, one of the"
1513,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"original proprietors, and at present one of the oldest men of the"
1514,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"congregation, conducted this part of public worship for several years."
1515,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1516,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"In 1840, the subject of an associate pastor was first brought forward;"
1517,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"and, in 1841, commenced those unfortunate difficulties in regard to it,"
1518,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"which continued with little interruption until the fall of 1845, when"
1519,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,the proprietors were called together to act upon a proposition to sell
1520,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,the meeting-house and wind up the affairs of the Society. This
1521,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"proposition was, however, rejected, by a decisive vote of more than two"
1522,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"to one, out of one hundred votes cast. During this period, the pulpit"
1523,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"was supplied one half the time by Father Ballou, and the other half by"
1524,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"Rev. T.C. Adam, from May, 1842, to May, 1843; by Rev. H.B. Soule, from"
1525,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"May, 1844, to May, 1845; and the other two years by the Standing"
1526,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,Committee.
1527,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,
1528,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"That portion of the Society who voted against the proposition to sell,"
1529,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"had, early in that year, taken counsel together in regard to the future"
1530,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,prosperity of the Society. Father Ballou expressed a willingness to be
1531,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"relieved from all active duties as pastor of the Society, other than"
1532,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"those he might choose to perform as senior pastor, and also to"
1533,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,relinquish his salary if the Society felt that with their whole means
1534,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,they would be able to secure the services of one who would again unite
1535,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"them together. Accordingly, September 28, 1845, the proprietors were"
1536,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"called together, and his proposition was accepted. They also unanimously"
1537,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,"invited the Rev. E.H. Chapin to become junior pastor, at a yearly salary"
1538,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,of two thousand dollars; and on the 8th of November the following
1539,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,acceptance of their call was received by the committee through whom the
1540,SCHOOL STREET SOCIETY.,invitation was tendered.

1807,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"hers, and induced man to acknowledge her equality with him."
1808,FEMALE EDUCATION.,
1809,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"Education exalts and refines the mind of woman, and enables her to"
1810,FEMALE EDUCATION.,contribute to the happiness of those around her. It is that which
1811,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"renders her the dutiful and obedient daughter, the kind and affectionate"
1812,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"sister, the trusting and loving companion, and the fond and tender"
1813,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"parent. The old adage, ""woman must be _ignorant_ in order to be useful,"""
1814,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"has been long thrown aside among the rubbish of the past, and remembered"
1815,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"only as a relic of the superstitions of other days. _Home_, with its"
1816,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"duties, is woman's sphere of action; and, to fulfil properly those"
1817,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"duties, _she must be educated_; she must not be kept in intellectual"
1818,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"bondage, but must be fully awakened to the responsibilities of her"
1819,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"station. It is she who watches over our infancy, guides our childhood,"
1820,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"presents to our infant minds the rudiments of knowledge, and cheers us"
1821,FEMALE EDUCATION.,in our progress by showing us the honors which attend those who acquire
1822,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"_true wisdom_, and therefore must her mind be early taught to comprehend"
1823,FEMALE EDUCATION.,the duties which devolve upon her.
1824,FEMALE EDUCATION.,
1825,FEMALE EDUCATION.,A broad field is that of Education; and while she strives to make
1826,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"acquisitions in the various branches of knowledge, let her not forget"
1827,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"that _better_ education of the mind and heart. Talent, without virtue to"
1828,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"guide, is like a ship without sails or rudder, exposed to the wild winds"
1829,FEMALE EDUCATION.,of the storm on the broad expanse of the ocean. What sadder spectacle
1830,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"can there be, than to behold a mind employing its talents and its"
1831,FEMALE EDUCATION.,learning in endeavoring to lead its fellow-beings away from the paths of
1832,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"rectitude, disregarding the laws of God and man, and refusing to"
1833,FEMALE EDUCATION.,acknowledge the Source that gave it birth? From such an example we turn
1834,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"with sorrow and disgust, and gladly look to those good and noble ones"
1835,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"who have adorned their sex. The names of Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth,"
1836,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"Felicia Hemans, Letitia Landon, Harriet Martineau, and a host of others,"
1837,FEMALE EDUCATION.,show what woman can do when properly educated; for they are equally
1838,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"distinguished in private, for their amiable and domestic qualities, as"
1839,FEMALE EDUCATION.,in public for their high intellectual attainments. Let woman follow
1840,FEMALE EDUCATION.,"their example, never failing to embrace all opportunities presented to"
1841,FEMALE EDUCATION.,her for moral and intellectual improvement.

1863,A FABLE.,
1864,A FABLE.,I suppose most of the readers of this little volume have been in the
1865,A FABLE.,"country the past summer. As you beheld the green grass, the fine"
1866,A FABLE.,"spreading trees, and the beautiful flowers that sprang up in your"
1867,A FABLE.,"pathway, perhaps the feeling came over you that you could be far happier"
1868,A FABLE.,in the country than in the city. We are very apt to suppose that change
1869,A FABLE.,of place will produce a more delightful state of feeling; forgetting
1870,A FABLE.,"that in a little time we should become familiar with all these objects,"
1871,A FABLE.,and then we return again to our former selves.
1872,A FABLE.,
1873,A FABLE.,Precisely so it is with children in the country. They come to this busy
1874,A FABLE.,"city, and eagerly gaze at the varied shows which attract the eye, and"
1875,A FABLE.,would prefer to exchange situations with _you_; but by and by they
1876,A FABLE.,"become wearied with sightseeing, and the home they have left rises"
1877,A FABLE.,"before them as a pleasanter abode than any other dwelling, however rich"
1878,A FABLE.,or elegant. Thus they learn to be _happy at home_; and this is a most
1879,A FABLE.,valuable attainment.
1880,A FABLE.,
1881,A FABLE.,"But, in order to be permanently happy, we must have something to do."
1882,A FABLE.,There are other lessons to be learned besides those we commit in the
1883,A FABLE.,"schoolroom. The whole world, indeed, is a school, and we are daily"
1884,A FABLE.,committing our tasks. These teachings are preparations for our future
1885,A FABLE.,happiness.
1886,A FABLE.,
1887,A FABLE.,"You have all noticed the growth of a tree. At first, only a little twig"
1888,A FABLE.,springs out of the ground. And so with the flower. You deposit only a
1889,A FABLE.,"tiny seed; but in a little time a shoot springs up, and by natural but"
1890,A FABLE.,"slow processes the twig becomes a large shady tree, and the shoot a"
1891,A FABLE.,"beautiful blooming flower. Though they grow very slowly, yet they never"
1892,A FABLE.,_rest_. Day and night the hidden processes are going on which help to
1893,A FABLE.,promote their growth. Just so it is with the minds of children. They are
1894,A FABLE.,daily acquiring those habits which will eventually make the whole sum of
1895,A FABLE.,"their characters. But then, great care is requisite how they form these"
1896,A FABLE.,"characters; that they may spring up in fair proportions, making their"
1897,A FABLE.,possessors worthy members of society.
1898,A FABLE.,
1899,A FABLE.,"I will illustrate this by a fable, which occurred to me as I walked over"
1900,A FABLE.,"the beautiful garden of a friend, with whom I spent a few weeks the past"
1901,A FABLE.,"summer. We will suppose, for our present purpose, that the flowers have"
1902,A FABLE.,an articulate voice.
1903,A FABLE.,
1904,A FABLE.,A stately dahlia grew in a cultivated garden. There were many of the
1905,A FABLE.,"same species of flowers, but no other had the peculiar variegated tints"
1906,A FABLE.,"of this particular one. Every one, in passing by it, was attracted by"
1907,A FABLE.,"its beauty. It seemed as if vain of flattery, although we know it had no"
1908,A FABLE.,"ears to hear, for every day it seemed to increase in size and beauty."
1909,A FABLE.,"With its lofty head, it gained a supremacy above all its neighbors, and"
1910,A FABLE.,the heavy shower and furious wind failed to soil its petals or bend its
1911,A FABLE.,graceful form.
1912,A FABLE.,
1913,A FABLE.,"Away off in the farther corner of the garden, under a hedge, bloomed a"
1914,A FABLE.,"simple white clover. It was entirely unheeded by the multitude, although"
1915,A FABLE.,"it gave a sweetness and fragrancy to the air, which made the invalid"
1916,A FABLE.,"stop to inhale it. In its modesty it bloomed, in its lowly bed it sought"
1917,A FABLE.,"no observation, and was passed by as a simple white clover. By and by"
1918,A FABLE.,the mower's scythe passed that way and levelled it among common grasses.
1919,A FABLE.,"It was gathered in the general mass of hay, and became a part of the"
1920,A FABLE.,sustenance of the master's cattle.
1921,A FABLE.,
1922,A FABLE.,"The dahlia was plucked by the horticulturist, and placed in a glass"
1923,A FABLE.,"receptacle, among kindred flowers, where it was gazed at for a time;"
1924,A FABLE.,then it faded and was thrown among common rubbish. During their lifetime
1925,A FABLE.,we will suppose them to have conversed together.
1926,A FABLE.,
1927,A FABLE.,"""I,"" said the dahlia, ""am queen of this garden. I attract every eye that"
1928,A FABLE.,"passes; while you, little clover, are hidden by the tall grass, and"
1929,A FABLE.,"liable to be crushed at any moment."""
1930,A FABLE.,
1931,A FABLE.,"""Well,"" replied the clover, ""let it be so _now_; but look at our _final"
1932,A FABLE.,"end_. You will be placed in a glass, plucked from your native stem,"
1933,A FABLE.,where you will wither and die as a worthless thing; while I shall be
1934,A FABLE.,"felled by the scythe, after I have reached my maturity, and then a"
1935,A FABLE.,"thousand tiny seeds will I strow around me; so that, another reason, I"
1936,A FABLE.,"shall bloom all about the hedges, and my usefulness will be appreciated."
1937,A FABLE.,"And pray where will you then be?"" The dahlia blushed, and hung its head"
1938,A FABLE.,for shame.
1939,A FABLE.,
1940,A FABLE.,"Here, children, is a fable designed to illustrate pride and humility."
1941,A FABLE.,"Which appears the most beautiful, because the most useful? I know you"
1942,A FABLE.,"will prefer humility to pride. If so, you must remember that the"
1943,A FABLE.,peculiar traits you now cultivate are forming within you the one or the
1944,A FABLE.,"other. By a thousand little kind acts, you can diffuse happiness in your"
1945,A FABLE.,"homes; and all the while you are disseminating these virtues, you are"
1946,A FABLE.,"acquiring these lasting graces, in _yourselves_, which will spring up,"
1947,A FABLE.,"like the violet and sweet clover, leaving a fragrancy and beauty"

1958,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,the Sabbath school to meet your happy countenances and smiling faces.
1959,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"Children, you do not assemble together for the purpose of passing an"
1960,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,hour that perhaps might pass unpleasantly elsewhere. It is for a higher
1961,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,and nobler purpose. It is to gain useful and religious instruction from
1962,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"the _Bible_, the best of all books. You should not be content with"
1963,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"learning and reciting your lessons, but you should try to remember what"
1964,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"you learn. And when you grow up to be men and women, you will never"
1965,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"regret it. It is in the _Bible_ that we are taught to love God, and all"

1977,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"as each season in its turn, spring, summer, autumn, and even winter,"
1978,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"clothed in its robes of snow, has its own pleasures, so each season of"

1980,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,
1981,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"Though it is now spring-time, it will soon be autumn with you, when you"

1984,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"childhood and youth are rightly employed, age will compare no more"
1985,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"unfavorably, as regards its joys, with youth and middle age, than does"
1986,A TALK WITH THE CHILDREN.,"winter with spring. Endeavor, then, to acquire that useful knowledge"

2140,THE INFLUENCE OF SABBATH SCHOOLS.,may assail even such a one; but their shafts will fall harmless at his

2142,THE INFLUENCE OF SABBATH SCHOOLS.,from the heart the influence of the high and holy lessons which it

2147,THE INFLUENCE OF SABBATH SCHOOLS.,"are intrusted to their hands. If they perform their duties faithfully,"
2148,THE INFLUENCE OF SABBATH SCHOOLS.,they may have the satisfaction of seeing the pupils of their charge

2250,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,In admiring the virtues and moral excellence of one who holds a high
2251,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"rank in society, who fills a distinguished place in the State, or"
2252,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"occupies a responsible seat in the halls of science or in the church, we"
2253,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,are liable to be swayed in our judgment. His social position is a kind
2254,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"of magnifying lens, through which all his virtues are viewed. But when a"
2255,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,comparatively obscure individual from the humbler walks of life claims
2256,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"our attention, we are better able to estimate his virtues at their true"
2257,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,value.
2258,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2259,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Such a one we meet with in the subject of this brief sketch. Miss Hannah
2260,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"S. Shedd was born in Boston, February 5, 1826. The death of her father,"
2261,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"preceded as it was by the death of her mother, left her an orphan at the"
2262,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,age of eight years. She was the second of three surviving children by
2263,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"their father's second marriage, all of whom were left in charge of a"
2264,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"half sister, who was the eldest of five children by a former marriage,"
2265,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,and who was all to them that a mother even could be.
2266,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2267,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"One of the parents was an Episcopalian in sentiment, the other a"
2268,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Universalist. The elder children were attendants upon Universalist
2269,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"worship in the School street Church, while the younger attended one of"
2270,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the Baptist churches of the city. Hannah, the subject of our sketch,"
2271,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,continued under the influence of Baptist doctrines and worship until
2272,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"about fifteen years of age, when at her own earnest solicitation she was"
2273,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"permitted to attend the Universalist church, and become a member of the"
2274,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,School street Universalist Sunday school.
2275,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2276,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,The influence upon her feelings of the change in regard to a place of
2277,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"worship, was very marked. She was naturally inclined to religious"
2278,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"meditation and reflection, but was never satisfied with what she had"
2279,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"been accustomed to hear. Nor can she be regarded as singular, in this"
2280,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,respect. However true it may be that Christianity is adapted in its
2281,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,simplicity to the susceptibilities of the young--and I believe this is
2282,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"eminently true--it is equally true, that the ordinary partialist"
2283,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,interpretations of it are not thus adapted to their susceptibilities.
2284,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"The young are not satisfied with these. The clearer their perceptions,"
2285,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"and the more comprehensive their thought, the greater is their"
2286,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"dissatisfaction. It was so with Hannah, even when but a child."
2287,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2288,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,But when the hungerings of her soul found their appropriate aliment in
2289,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the ministrations of the venerable Hosea Ballou, then the sole pastor of"
2290,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the church to which she turned for peace, the change was in the highest"
2291,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,degree salutary. Her satisfaction was very great. She also found great
2292,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,pleasure in accompanying her eldest sister to the Rev. Mr. Streeter's
2293,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Friday evening meetings; and so highly did she prize these religious
2294,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"privileges, that she could scarcely submit to be deprived of them for a"
2295,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,single evening or Sabbath without shedding tears.
2296,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2297,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Her natural amiability and generosity of disposition--a generosity
2298,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"especially marked in her demeanor towards her eldest sister, who had"
2299,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,become a mother to her--made the Universalist interpretation of
2300,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Christianity to be to her indeed the ""bread of life."" Not only did she"
2301,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,seek for this spiritual nutriment in the regular ministrations of the
2302,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"sanctuary and in the conference meeting, but she turned also to the"
2303,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Sabbath school with the same fond devotion to Christian truth.
2304,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2305,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,During the connection of the Rev. Mr. Soule with the School street
2306,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Society, he established a Bible class, of which Miss Shedd became one of"
2307,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,the earliest members. She has often spoken to the writer of this of the
2308,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,great profit she was conscious of having derived therefrom. She was also
2309,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,one of the earliest members of the class formed by the present junior
2310,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"pastor of the Society, Rev. Mr. Miner, and in the discharge of her"
2311,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"duties in that capacity she showed uncommon clearness of perception, and"
2312,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,not a little vigor of thought.
2313,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2314,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,At the age of fourteen she left school and took up the needle that she
2315,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,might aid her sisters in gaining for the family an honorable
2316,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,maintenance. She has been known to ply the needle with all diligence
2317,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"till ten o'clock at night, and then turn to her Sunday school book to"
2318,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,make preparation for the Sabbath. If this is an example of too severe
2319,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"application to toil, it shows at the same time a devotion to spiritual"
2320,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,culture in the highest degree commendable.
2321,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2322,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Strict integrity and a strong sense of justice characterized her even in
2323,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,her childhood. A little circumstance bearing upon this point I will
2324,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"relate. She had been to an apothecary's shop for some medicines, and on"
2325,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,reaching home found that she had received back more change than was due.
2326,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Of her own accord she proposed to return it, nor would she willingly"
2327,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,delay for a moment the performance of so manifest an act of justice. She
2328,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"received from the apothecary the highest encomium, and a reward for her"
2329,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,integrity. In all her transactions she showed the same scrupulousness in
2330,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"matters of right, and thus became a bright example for all children to"
2331,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,imitate.
2332,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2333,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,She was not less remarkable for her obedience to the wishes of her
2334,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"sister, than for her regard for justice. She not only obeyed, but obeyed"
2335,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,readily and cheerfully. And so sensible is that sister of her great
2336,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"excellence in this respect, now that she has passed away, that she"
2337,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,cannot speak of her but with the deepest emotion.
2338,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2339,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,She seemed to have very little power to bear disappointment. Her
2340,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"feelings were very tender, and her sensibilities great. Disappointment,"
2341,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"therefore, brought the ready tear to her eye; and solicitous affection,"
2342,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"if possible, removed the pressure which had caused it. But some of the"
2343,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,later revelations of her life indicated rare ability to endure
2344,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"disappointment, and to cherish hope even in the audience-chamber of"
2345,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,death. Thus will it appear in the end that her heart was full of
2346,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Christian confidence and holy trust.
2347,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2348,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"In the course of June, 1850, it was observed by her friends that her"
2349,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,health was manifestly declining. She was advised to leave her employment
2350,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"at once, and seek in relaxation and change of scene the reestablishment"
2351,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,of her health and the restoration of her accustomed vigor. Accordingly
2352,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"accompanied by her brother, she spent some three weeks of the month of"
2353,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,July in various parts of Maine; but health did not come back to her.
2354,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,Disease was too deeply seated to be beguiled away.
2355,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2356,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,She returned to her home but to languish and die. When the news of her
2357,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"mortal illness reached the Sabbath school, in which she had now been a"
2358,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"faithful and beloved teacher for about a year, it produced the most"
2359,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,intense interest and solicitude. All felt that a dearly beloved sister
2360,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"had become the victim of the destroyer. That, however, which was a"
2361,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"source of unmingled grief in the beginning, became a sanctifying power"
2362,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,in the end.
2363,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2364,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,When first informed that it was feared her disease would terminate
2365,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"fatally, she betrayed the deepest emotion, with scarcely the utterance"
2366,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,of a word. Her natural sensibility made the weight upon her spirits seem
2367,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,insupportable. But when the first shock was past and her powers had had
2368,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"time to rally, she was found equal to the trial that awaited her. That"
2369,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"truth which she had long loved, and which had produced very little of"
2370,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"that Christian display by which the world judges, had wrought silently"
2371,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,but powerfully upon her understanding and her heart. It had begotten
2372,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"hopes in a naturally hopeful spirit, stronger than death itself."
2373,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2374,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,When her pastor from time to time spoke to her of the labors and
2375,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"sacrifices of Christ, of the love of the Father and of the blessedness"
2376,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"of immortality, leading her sometimes to meditate upon the highest forms"
2377,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"of Christian truth, the smile of satisfaction that played upon her"
2378,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"countenance, showed not only that her powers were equal to the effort,"
2379,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,but that her heart was satisfied with its fruit.
2380,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2381,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Her disease, which was consumption, was of a very painful character,"
2382,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,especially as regarded difficulty of breathing. She was compelled to sit
2383,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"up continually, almost to the hour of her death. Yet in the moment of"
2384,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"expected dissolution, so generous was her nature, her heart was yearning"
2385,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,for blessings on others rather than herself. At one time just before her
2386,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,death she requested her pastor to remember in his prayer an absent
2387,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"sister, that she might recover from a critical illness; and in one of"
2388,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"his last interviews with her, she desired him to ""attend her funeral and"
2389,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"comfort her brothers and sisters, and especially that sister who had"
2390,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"been a mother to her."" ""_Oh, Hannah has always been a good girl_"" burst"
2391,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"from the lips of that sister,--an involuntary tribute to cheerful, ready"
2392,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"obedience, and true excellence of heart. She had given some little"
2393,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"memento of affection to each of the family and friends, and enjoined"
2394,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"upon her brother, who still remains with the sisters, to ""be sure and be"
2395,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"kind to them,"" when she quietly fell asleep."
2396,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2397,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Thus died an excellent young woman, Oct. 2d, 1850, aged 24 years and 8"
2398,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,months. The strength of her trust and the depth of her Christian
2399,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"experience could be seen in her meek submission to suffering, in that"
2400,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,remarkable patience which allowed not a word of murmuring to escape her
2401,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"lips through the whole progress of her disease, and which enabled her to"
2402,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,believe that every providence of God is ordered in perfect wisdom.
2403,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2404,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"Humble in her outward position, her spiritual attainments were of the"
2405,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,most exalted character. The stores of excellence treasured in her heart
2406,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"were made manifest in the hour of great trial, and the Christian"
2407,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"instruction to which she was accustomed to apply herself, begat the"
2408,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,holiest resignation and the most confident trust.
2409,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,
2410,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,The fact that this good was in no small degree wrought in the Sabbath
2411,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"school, should lead the Sabbath school teacher to understand the dignity"
2412,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"and importance of his office, the opportunities he enjoys for directing"
2413,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,"the affections of the young heart, and the necessity of a large measure"
2414,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,of Christian attainment to qualify him for the successful discharge of
2415,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,so great responsibilities. May the example of our departed sister be
2416,A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH.,sanctified to the good of all thus employed.

2423,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2424,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"""What do we go to the Sabbath school for?"" asked a little boy of his"
2425,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"companion who was some years older than himself, and who had, as I"
2426,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"discovered by their conversation, attended the school for a long time,"
2427,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"that is, compared with the time which many children, boys especially,"
2428,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,think it of any use to go to the Sabbath school. Some boys when at the
2429,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"age of twelve or fourteen years, think they are too old to receive any"
2430,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,benefit from Sabbath school instruction. Hearing the question of this
2431,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"little boy, and observing the look of intelligence and sincerity in his"
2432,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"companion, and being desirous of knowing what answer would be given, I"
2433,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"remained within hearing of their conversation, and will try to present"
2434,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"to the scholars in our school, through the medium of ""Our Gift,"" the"
2435,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"good reasons which he gave to his little companion, (who was his younger"

2437,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2438,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ I go because I like to go, and I like to go because I always"
2439,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,enjoy myself there better than I do anywhere else. I find pleasure in
2440,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"the singing, in the prayer, and in the lessons. The lessons are not hard"
2441,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"to learn when I understand them, and the learning of them is even a"
2442,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,pleasant task; for my teacher has a way of making our lessons
2443,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"interesting to us, in hearing us recite. He asks us questions about the"
2444,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"subject of the lesson before using the book, and he generally finds some"
2445,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"interesting matter relating to it, and we become so much engaged that"
2446,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"the time is gone before we are aware of it, and we have to stop and wait"
2447,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,for the next session of the school.
2448,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2449,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Young. B._ I like the school too, though I have been only twice. How"
2450,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"old was you when you first went to the Sabbath school, brother?"
2451,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2452,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ I was seven years old, and I am now fourteen; and I mean to"
2453,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,continue till I am able to take a class myself. I want to have the
2454,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"pleasure of being a teacher in our school, and I hope soon to do so, for"
2455,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,the school is increasing very fast in numbers. There are a good many
2456,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"small children coming into the school, and I think that I shall be"
2457,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"wanted, for I observe that there are not male teachers enough. Sometimes"
2458,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"one teacher has to attend to two or more classes, and the time of a"
2459,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,session in the school is not sufficient to do this with much advantage.
2460,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"What did you learn in twice going to the school? tell me that, and then"
2461,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"we shall know, at least, what you went to the Sabbath school for."
2462,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2463,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Young. B._ I will tell you. After I had said a short lesson, my teacher"
2464,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"gave me a little piece called ""The Child's First Hymn,"" which she said"
2465,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,she found in a paper published in England. It was published for the
2466,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,children of the Sabbath schools of Old England. She said it would do for
2467,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"us, the children of New England, and wished me to learn it."
2468,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2469,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ Well, brother, I am sure you have improved the few times that"

2508,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ It is indeed a very pretty hymn, and I am glad you have"
2509,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,learned it so well. I hope you will never forget it. Here comes my
2510,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"teacher; and as it will be ten minutes before the school commences, we"
2511,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,shall have time for conversation.
2512,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2513,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,Here the teacher drew near and spoke to the boys:--
2514,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2515,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Teach._ Good morning, my boys; how do you do, this fine morning?"
2516,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2517,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ Good morning, sir; we are well, I thank you."
2518,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2519,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Teach._ You are in good season this morning, and I am glad to see that"
2520,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"you are. It is so much better to be before our time, than to be a little"
2521,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"late. We get along so much better with the business of the school, and"
2522,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"have time to converse together. Besides, to be in school at the opening"
2523,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"of the exercises, shows that you value and wish to improve its"
2524,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,privileges.
2525,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2526,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ We were talking about the school, and why we go there. I told"
2527,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,my brother that I went because I like to go. Will you please to tell us
2528,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,the advantages of attendance on the Sabbath school?
2529,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2530,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Teach._ I will, my dear boys, so far as I can. It is well to know what"
2531,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"we are doing, how we are accomplishing our work, and what is to be the"
2532,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,result of our labors.
2533,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2534,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ I am very often asked what I learn at the Sabbath school, and"
2535,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"I sometimes answer that I learn what there is in the Bible, and that my"
2536,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,lessons are subjects derived principally from that book.
2537,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2538,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Teach._ You answer rightly so far. You might add, also, that you learn"
2539,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,by the example of others. Do you see punctuality? You will learn to be
2540,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"punctual. Do you see system in the arrangement of the school, in the"
2541,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"method of instruction, in the library department, and in the general"
2542,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,discipline of the school? You will be orderly and correct in your
2543,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,deportment.
2544,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2545,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Eld. B._ As I am almost old enough to be a teacher, and desire to take"
2546,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"a class as soon as I am wanted, I should like to know the best way to"
2547,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"make my scholars interested in their studies, so that they will attend"
2548,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,and be correct with their lessons.
2549,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2550,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Teach._ It is often the case that children feel no interest or pleasure
2551,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"in the school, because they do not understand its object. They may"
2552,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"recite well, so far as to repeat the words of the lesson, yet if it be"
2553,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"above their capacity, they will not be benefited."
2554,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2555,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Eld. B._ This has been the case with me sometimes. After I had recited
2556,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"my lesson correctly by the book, I have felt that I did not know much"
2557,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"about it, and did not understand what I had learned to repeat."
2558,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2559,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Teach_. It is of great importance in teaching that the subject should
2560,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"be presented to the pupil in the simplest form possible, that he may be"
2561,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,profited by his instructions. I read an anecdote the other day which
2562,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"illustrates this matter, and I will repeat it to you. ""It is related of"
2563,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"Dr. Green, of Philadelphia, that in early life he was one day"
2564,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"returning from the services of the sanctuary, and was accosted by a"
2565,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,woman in the humble walks of life. She found difficulty in understanding
2566,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"him, and took the liberty of giving her youthful pastor a hint. 'Mr."
2567,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"Green,' says she 'what do you think is the great duty of the shepherd?'"
2568,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"'No doubt, to feed the flock, madam,' was the reply. 'That is my notion"
2569,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"too,' she added, 'and therefore I think he should not hold the hay so"
2570,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,high that the sheep cannot reach it.' This admonition was kindly
2571,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"received, in the spirit in which it was given, and had an influence in"
2572,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"making him afterwards 'hold the hay lower.'"" This fact should cause you"
2573,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"to see to it, as the old lady did with her pastor, that your teachers"
2574,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,present their instructions in such a form that you will understand them.
2575,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"The hay may be of very good quality, but it will give no nourishment to"
2576,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,the hungry sheep if it is beyond their reach; it will not benefit them
2577,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,any more than if it were not provided at all. So with your lessons. If
2578,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"you do not feel an interest in them, if they are beyond your reach, they"
2579,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"may be of no benefit to you. No lasting principle is gained, but the"
2580,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"whole may be lost, as the words of the lesson are lost to memory and"
2581,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,forgotten.
2582,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2583,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Eld. B._ What are the results of attendance on the Sabbath school?
2584,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2585,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"_Teach._ That question we answer, partly in faith, and partly by"
2586,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,knowledge. Faith is good;--and we know that our school is a good school;
2587,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,we know that we enjoy ourselves there; and we know what is learned there
2588,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,is good. It is there that divine influences and joyful communions fill
2589,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"with gladness the hour. We enjoy them, and if we could say no more, we"
2590,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,think that this would be sufficient.
2591,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2592,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Eld. B._ That is true.
2593,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2594,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Teach._ But that is not all; the results go still further. They are not
2595,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,confined to the hour passed in the schoolroom. The scholar is better and
2596,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,happier for having been there. Is it not so with you?
2597,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2598,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Eld. B._ Yes sir; I always feel better when I have been to the school.
2599,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"When I have said my lesson, conversed upon the subject of it, and"
2600,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"obtained my library book, I am always glad to have been there."
2601,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2602,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,_Teach._ Your answer is full of hope and promise; for if you now find
2603,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"your enjoyment in learning the things of the Kingdom of God, those evil"
2604,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"days will never come to you, when you will say you have no pleasure in"
2605,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,them. The Sabbath school scholar who is prompt in his duty is in a safe
2606,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"path,--one which, while affording happiness by the way, results in the"
2607,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,fulness of joy. To him the example of Christ is an example of love and
2608,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"goodness, drawing him to the Father by these divine influences and"
2609,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"attractions. ""He sees God, not only as the Creator, but as he is"
2610,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"manifested in the world, by his providence, which shows us that he not"
2611,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"only _made_ the world, but that he _makes_ the world; that he is the"
2612,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,same in the creation of the flowers and streams as in the creation of
2613,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"storms and tempests; that he is not far off, but near, ever blessing us"
2614,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,with the favors of his parental providence; that his power is over
2615,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"everything; that motion is his power, for there can be no motion without"
2616,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,mind; that God is present in the child. It cannot live by bread alone.
2617,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"Communion must be held with God--spirit with spirit."""
2618,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,
2619,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"It is recorded of our Savior that he was led into the waters, and was"
2620,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,buried in baptism; the Spirit descended upon him; he heard the
2621,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,encouragement of that voice which proclaimed his Sonship to the Most
2622,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"High, and in the enjoyment of that holy time he came up from the river."
2623,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"Then came the tempter; in the strength of the spirit of the baptism, he"
2624,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"resisted the temptation, and was victorious over all its forms. So with"
2625,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,the object and mission of our Sabbath schools. You are led to the river
2626,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"of divine truth, that you may be baptized in its pure waters. You are"
2627,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"there shown the Father, and we trust that when you go out into the"
2628,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"world, you will, in the strength of your Sabbath school baptism, resist"
2629,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"and overcome all temptation to wrong, and being always engaged for the"
2630,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,"right, and living in the light of the gospel, you will pass through life"
2631,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,undefined; thus may a Christian character be the result of your
2632,THE SABBATH SCHOOL BOYS.,attendance on the Sabbath school.

2658,ILL TEMPER.,
2659,ILL TEMPER.,"It was the season of vacation, when children's minds are given to play,"
2660,ILL TEMPER.,"instead of study. It was during this interval, that a little girl, whom"
2661,ILL TEMPER.,"we will call Jane, came from a neighboring town to visit one of her"
2662,ILL TEMPER.,"school-mates, another little girl, whose name we will call Emily."
2663,ILL TEMPER.,
2664,ILL TEMPER.,The disposition of Emily was very different from that of Jane. She was
2665,ILL TEMPER.,"always pleasant and kind, willing to confer favors upon others, even"
2666,ILL TEMPER.,"though she should not receive the same in return. Jane was ill-tempered,"
2667,ILL TEMPER.,"told wrong stories, and did many things which rendered her a very"
2668,ILL TEMPER.,"disagreeable companion. Her parents could see no fault in her, therefore"
2669,ILL TEMPER.,"she was permitted to give way to her temper, which was the cause of her"
2670,ILL TEMPER.,losing friends and gaining enemies. When she was in these violent fits
2671,ILL TEMPER.,of passion she would accuse her companions of things which would wound
2672,ILL TEMPER.,"their feelings very much. During vacation, Emily accepted an invitation"
2673,ILL TEMPER.,which had been given her to spend a few days with Jane.
2674,ILL TEMPER.,
2675,ILL TEMPER.,She enjoyed herself very much while there and invited Jane to come and
2676,ILL TEMPER.,see her. Soon after Jane went to visit Emily. The first part of the
2677,ILL TEMPER.,"time, she enjoyed very much; but as her visit was drawing to a close,"
2678,ILL TEMPER.,she gave way to a violent fit of temper. She took this opportunity to
2679,ILL TEMPER.,relate to Emily many things her parents said about her after she had
2680,ILL TEMPER.,left them. She told her that if she knew what her father and mother said
2681,ILL TEMPER.,"about her, she would never visit them again. Whether they did talk about"
2682,ILL TEMPER.,"her, or whether it was Jane's ugly temper, that led her to taunt Emily,"
2683,ILL TEMPER.,"I do not know. But it caused Emily to feel very much grieved, because"
2684,ILL TEMPER.,she was not conscious of having done anything which would cause them to
2685,ILL TEMPER.,"talk about her. Emily has never visited Jane since, nor has she desired"
2686,ILL TEMPER.,to. She thinks that those who treat her well when she is present and
2687,ILL TEMPER.,"talk about her when she is absent, cannot be her true friends. Thus we"
2688,ILL TEMPER.,"see that those who govern their temper, and endeavor to make themselves"
2689,ILL TEMPER.,"pleasant and agreeable, are much more loved and respected than those who"
2690,ILL TEMPER.,give way to this wicked passion.

2698,READING.,"In my experience, both as teacher and scholar, I have observed among the"
2699,READING.,"young those who read a great many books, but at the end appear but"
2700,READING.,little wiser. They may have a confused and indistinct recollection of
2701,READING.,"events and characters, and may be able perhaps to follow out the plan of"
2702,READING.,a story. Out of the mass that they have read they may have retained a
2703,READING.,"great many facts; but being without connection or object, they are"
2704,READING.,"nearly useless. Bad habits are formed, their reading is to no purpose,"
2705,READING.,"and their time, therefore, misspent."
2706,READING.,
2707,READING.,I fear there are too few among those whose years should enable them to
2708,READING.,"understand and appreciate the objects for which we live, that do"
2709,READING.,appreciate them. There are too many who suppose that reading is only a
2710,READING.,very pleasant amusement. They think of printing as a very ingenious
2711,READING.,"invention, and have no thought higher. They may look about and see a"
2712,READING.,great deal of misery and unhappiness; but its alleviation is nothing to
2713,READING.,"them. ""The great mission of life"" is something that is very well to be"
2714,READING.,"talked of in the pulpit, and ministers and reformers will accomplish it,"
2715,READING.,no doubt. But life has no responsibilities for them.
2716,READING.,
2717,READING.,One of our first duties is to seek our own moral and intellectual
2718,READING.,culture. Let both these portions of our nature be cultivated together.
2719,READING.,"Do not separate them, for by so doing both are threatened with danger."
2720,READING.,"Heart without mind is generally weak, but mind without heart is always"
2721,READING.,dangerous. Do not suppose because you have left the schoolroom and no
2722,READING.,"longer have lessons set, and are no longer reprimanded if they are not"
2723,READING.,"committed, that your education is finished. Rather regard the _school_"
2724,READING.,"as the place where you shall learn to study, life as your term-time, and"
2725,READING.,consider your education finished when there is nothing more for you to
2726,READING.,learn. It is not necessary that study should be confined to books.
2727,READING.,Accustom yourself to study actions and their influences and effects.
2728,READING.,"Public lectures, conversations, in short, every event of your life, will"
2729,READING.,"present questions, and your own mind, with a little reflection, will"
2730,READING.,"present the answers. If it does not, do not let the fear of ridicule"
2731,READING.,prevent your asking.
2732,READING.,
2733,READING.,"But it is through books, chiefly, that we are to look for improvement."
2734,READING.,Every person should appropriate some part of each day to reading. Young
2735,READING.,persons should early be taught the advantages of a method for
2736,READING.,appropriating their time. Let each duty have its time. In this way much
2737,READING.,time is saved. Let the time you appropriate to reading be one that will
2738,READING.,"be the least liable to interruption. Defer it not, if it can be avoided,"
2739,READING.,"till late in the evening, when you are wearied with the fatigues of the"
2740,READING.,day.
2741,READING.,
2742,READING.,"At the present day, when books are so easily obtained, there is no need"
2743,READING.,of the excuse of inability to procure them. Circulating libraries are
2744,READING.,"easy of access,--though caution should be used in selecting from"
2745,READING.,"them,--and each Sabbath school has a library open for all. There has"
2746,READING.,"been much said, and much written about books of fiction, whether they"
2747,READING.,may be read with safety by the young. Fiction as such need not be
2748,READING.,"condemned, though works of fiction should be sparingly read. But if read"
2749,READING.,"at all, let them be selected by persons of experience. There is much in"
2750,READING.,the current fiction of the day that is pernicious and unfit for
2751,READING.,publication.
2752,READING.,
2753,READING.,"But if we set aside the light reading, there are standard works enough"
2754,READING.,to furnish reading for one generation. The better newspapers of the day
2755,READING.,should be carefully read. The newspapers of this week are the history of
2756,READING.,the world for this week. In each particular branch of literature there
2757,READING.,"are books without number, not only worthy of perusal, but deserving of"
2758,READING.,"careful study. In history we have Rollin, Hume, Smollet, Prescott,"
2759,READING.,"Macaulay, and Robertson. Philosophy, theology, and science, each in its"
2760,READING.,"turn, brings names as illustrious."
2761,READING.,
2762,READING.,But there is one book above all others. Never complain for want of
2763,READING.,"reading while we have such historians as Moses, poets before whom"
2764,READING.,"Shakspeare dwindles into insignificance, philosophers of a higher and"
2765,READING.,"holier school, and truths that exceed the most astonishing fictions."
2766,READING.,Where has Scott a heroine that can compare with Ruth? Grand as are the
2767,READING.,"beauties of the Bible, life-giving as is its wisdom, and imperishable as"
2768,READING.,"are its truths, it is too frequently left unread."
2769,READING.,
2770,READING.,"As a general thing, too much is read; more than can be well retained."
2771,READING.,One page well read is more beneficial than a whole volume merely glanced
2772,READING.,over. Never read the second line until the first is fully understood.
2773,READING.,Make the author's sentiments your own. In reading history it is highly
2774,READING.,important you should have a clear idea of the locality where the events
2775,READING.,occurred. I have found by experience that the best method deeply to
2776,READING.,"impress what I have read, is to have at hand writing materials, and"
2777,READING.,after each reading write out as fully as possible whatever new idea has
2778,READING.,"been presented. But in all that you read, keep in view the great object"
2779,READING.,"of your reading,--_Self Improvement_."

2819,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And there a crowd, intent on sports more gay,"
2820,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,In lively measure tread the hours away.
2821,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Some roam in groups through fields and meadows green,"
2822,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And laden with the fragrant spoils are seen,"
2823,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Bedecked with crowns from Flora's own fair hand,"
2824,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,A radiant company from Fairy-land.
2825,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Apart from this another group behold,"
2826,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,A burden sweet their little arms unfold--
2827,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Lilies, fit emblem, when by childhood twined,"
2828,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Of purity and innocence combined.
2829,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,But hark! what sound is pealing through the air?
2830,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,A summons from their sports to join in prayer;
2831,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Come one and all, your voices mingle here,"
2832,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,To bless His presence who is ever near.
2833,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"From east and west they come, from south and north,"
2834,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"From every path and thicket issuing forth,"
2835,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Till all together seated once again,"
2836,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,The songs of worship and of praise begin.
2837,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Up to the throne of Heaven their prayers ascend,"
2838,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Together rich and poor their voices blend;
2839,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"While with their songs unite the feathered choir,"
2840,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"With gratitude each spirit to inspire,"
2841,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Till hill and valley echo all around,"
2842,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And ""God's first temples"" with His praise resound."
2843,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,And look! for now again the scene is changed;
2844,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"A group before that rustic altar ranged,"
2845,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"With bended knee the throne of grace implore,"
2846,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,On infant heads its showers of love to pour;
2847,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"That infant tongues may lisp the praise of God,"
2848,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,To guide their feet in paths by Jesus trod.
2849,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Sure, angels hallow scenes like this below,"
2850,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And holy spirits at that altar bow,"
2851,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Like winged messengers from Heaven, to bear"
2852,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"These offerings, and ever guard them there,"
2853,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"That every bud of promise reared below,"
2854,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"May bloom in Heaven, and to perfection grow."
2855,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,But fast in scenes like this the day is spent;
2856,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Again toward home their weary steps are bent.
2857,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Weary with pleasure, they reluctant go,"
2858,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Once more the toils and cares of earth to know:
2859,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"But purified, and strengthened for the strife"
2860,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Of labor, and the busy scenes of life;"
2861,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,While the remembrance of those happy hours
2862,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Shall deck the barren path of toil with flowers;
2863,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And praying each that as the years roll on,"
2864,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Laden with pleasures soon forever gone,"
2865,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Each year shall bring but added virtues forth,"
2866,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,And leave behind the impress of their worth;
2867,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Till every heart to innocence be tuned,"
2868,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Nor sinful pleasures ever dare intrude,"
2869,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"To mar the image God has made and blest,"
2870,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"With means of pleasure, happiness and rest;"
2871,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"That all may find, in holy joys and pure,"
2872,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"Relief from care, for every sorrow cure;"
2873,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,"And live to be in holy pleasures blest,"
2874,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,Till earthly toil is changed for heavenly rest.
2875,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,
2876,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,
2877,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,
2878,A SABBATH SCHOOL EXCURSION.,
2879,CHRIST AND DUTY.,CHRIST AND DUTY.
2880,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2881,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2882,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"It is profitable for us to meditate on such a character as Christ's, if"
2883,CHRIST AND DUTY.,by dwelling upon it we become even in one respect like him. The more we
2884,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"know of him, the more we shall love him; for his character is love. We"
2885,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"should imitate the example of Mary, who was first at the door of the"
2886,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"sepulchre where Jesus was laid. She had great love for him, and her"
2887,CHRIST AND DUTY.,faith in him was as strong as her love. She was not a stranger to the
2888,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"miracles which he performed while here on earth. She had seen him, and"
2889,CHRIST AND DUTY.,she knew that in him perfection dwelt. So we should try to be first in
2890,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"doing any act of kindness or benevolence, not in a spirit of unholy"
2891,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"emulation, but from a love of doing good. By cultivating this spirit we"
2892,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"shall be happy in life, and prepared for death. We shall be far happier"
2893,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"than those who seek worldly honors; and more than all, we shall leave a"
2894,CHRIST AND DUTY.,name behind us more precious than fame or wealth can bestow. When I was
2895,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"young as are many of you to whom I am now speaking, I had not the"
2896,CHRIST AND DUTY.,privilege of worshipping God as we now do. I was taught that a greater
2897,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"part of the human family will be destroyed, and will have no part in the"
2898,CHRIST AND DUTY.,heavenly kingdom. But thanks be to God that he has now opened the eyes
2899,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"of many to see him a Father to the fatherless, and a sure help in time"
2900,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"of need. When such thoughts take possession of the heart, we view him in"
2901,CHRIST AND DUTY.,his true character.
2902,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2903,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"In order to serve him as we ought, we should commence in youth. Christ"
2904,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"said, ""they that seek me early shall find me."" The whole life is short,"
2905,CHRIST AND DUTY.,if happily spent in his service. We have every encouragement to trust
2906,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"wholly in his kind care and keeping, for his watchful eye is ever over"
2907,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"us. If you seek Christ in youth, nothing will be lost, but much will be"
2908,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"gained. When I look back upon the early days of my life, I regard them"
2909,CHRIST AND DUTY.,as lost to the true service of Christ. It was impressed upon my young
2910,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"mind, that God was filled with anger and wrath; and still I was told"
2911,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"that I must love him with my whole heart. I am sorry to say it, but I"
2912,CHRIST AND DUTY.,fear I had no true love for him at that time. If the path in which I
2913,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"have walked has been desolate and dreary, I do not desire that others"
2914,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"should walk in it. If God is seen in his true loveliness, the young, as"
2915,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"well as the old, will love his holy name."
2916,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2917,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"In this regard, I think much good can be done in the Sabbath school, and"
2918,CHRIST AND DUTY.,many profitable and lasting impressions may be made upon the young mind.
2919,CHRIST AND DUTY.,I cannot think we meet together every Sabbath in vain. The blessing of
2920,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"God will surely rest upon us, and we shall be profited by our"
2921,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"assemblings. We must not be forgetful of God, for he is not forgetful of"
2922,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"us. When we lie down on our pillow at night, we ought not to close our"
2923,CHRIST AND DUTY.,eyes to sleep without thanking him for his kind care of us through the
2924,CHRIST AND DUTY.,day; and in the morning we should thank him for his watchful care
2925,CHRIST AND DUTY.,through the night.
2926,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2927,CHRIST AND DUTY.,In time of sorrow and trouble we at once fly to him. This is right; but
2928,CHRIST AND DUTY.,still it is our duty and privilege to call on him in time of prosperity
2929,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"as well as in time of adversity, never forgetting to seek his divine"
2930,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"blessing. Without this we cannot enjoy life, or be prepared for death."
2931,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"And when the days on earth are all passed, and we are called to lay"
2932,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"ourselves on the bed of death, if we can but look back upon a life well"
2933,CHRIST AND DUTY.,"spent, it will smooth the pillow of pain, and make even death itself"
2934,CHRIST AND DUTY.,sweet.
2935,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2936,CHRIST AND DUTY.,Salvation is the right direction of all one's powers and activities.
2937,CHRIST AND DUTY.,
2938,CHRIST AND DUTY.,Hope is the sunshine of the soul.
