131,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.
132,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
133,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
134,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"AS Brownies rambled 'round one night,"
135,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,A country schoolhouse came in sight;
136,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And there they paused awhile to speak
137,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"About the place, where through the week"
138,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The scholars came, with smile or whine,"
139,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
140,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
141,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
142,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Each morning at the stroke of nine.
143,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"""This is,"" said one, ""the place, indeed,"
144,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Where children come to write and read.
145,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"'T is here, through rules and rods to suit,"
146,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The young idea learns to shoot;
147,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And here the idler with a grin
148,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"In nearest neighbor pokes the pin,"
149,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
150,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
151,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
152,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Or sighs to break his scribbled slate
153,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And spring at once to man's estate.
154,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,How oft from shades of yonder grove
155,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,I've viewed at eve the shouting drove
156,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"As from the door they crowding broke,"
157,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Like oxen from beneath the yoke."""
158,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
159,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Another said: ""The teacher's chair,"
160,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The ruler, pen, and birch are there,"
161,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The blackboard hangs against the wall;
162,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The slate's at hand, the books and all."
163,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,We might go in to read and write
164,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And master sums like scholars bright."""
165,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
166,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
167,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
168,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
169,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
170,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The more they talked, the stronger grew"
171,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The wish to prove how much they knew.
172,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,From page to page through books to pass
173,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And spell the words that tried the class;
174,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,So through their skill they soon obtained
175,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Access to all the room contained.
176,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
177,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
178,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
179,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"""I'll play,"" cried one, ""the teacher's part;"
180,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"I know some lessons quite by heart,"
181,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And every section of the land
182,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"To me is plain as open hand."""
183,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"""With all respect, my friend, to you,"""
184,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Another said, ""that would not do."
185,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"You're hardly fitted, sir, to rule;"
186,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
187,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
188,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
189,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Your place should be the dunce's stool.
190,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,You're not with great endowments blessed;
191,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Besides, your temper's not the best,"
192,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And those who train the budding mind
193,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Should own a disposition kind.
194,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The rod looks better on the tree
195,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Than resting by the master's knee;
196,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"_I'll_ be the teacher, if you please;"
197,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"I know the rivers, lakes, and seas,"
198,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And, like a banker's clerk, can throw"
199,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The figures nimbly in a row.
200,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"I have the patience, love, and grace,"
201,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"So requisite in such a case."""
202,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
203,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
204,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
205,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
206,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Now some bent o'er a slate or book,"
207,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And some at blackboards station took.
208,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"They clustered 'round the globe with zeal,"
209,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And kept it turning like a wheel.
210,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Said one, ""I've often heard it said,"
211,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The world is rounder than your head,"
212,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And here, indeed, we find it true."
213,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"With both the poles at once in view,"
214,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,With latitudes and each degree
215,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"All measured out on land and sea."""
216,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Another said, ""I thought I knew"
217,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The world from Maine to Timbuctoo,"
218,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Or could, without a guide, have found"
219,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,My way from Cork to Puget Sound;
220,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,But here so many things I find
221,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"That never dawned upon my mind,"
222,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"On sundry points, I blush to say,"
223,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"I've been a thousand miles astray."""
224,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"""'T is like an egg,"" another cried,"
225,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"""A little longer than it's wide,"
226,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,With islands scattered through the seas
227,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Where savages may live at ease;
228,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
229,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
230,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
231,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
232,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
233,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And buried up in Polar snows
234,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,You find the hardy Eskimos;
235,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,While here and there some scorching spots
236,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Are set apart for Hottentots.
237,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And see the rivers small and great,"
238,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,That drain a province or a state;
239,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The name and shape of every nation;
240,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Their faith, extent, and population:"
241,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And whether governed by a King,"
242,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"A President, or council ring."""
243,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
244,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
245,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
246,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,While some with such expressions bold
247,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Surveyed the globe as 'round it rolled,"
248,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Still others turned to ink and pen,"
249,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And, spreading like a brooding hen,"
250,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,They scrawled a page to show the band
251,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Their special ""style,"" or ""business hand."""
252,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
253,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
254,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
255,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"The teacher had enough to do,"
256,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,To act his part to nature true:
257,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"He lectured well the infant squad,"
258,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"He rapped the desk and shook the rod,"
259,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And stood the dunce upon the stool,"
260,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,A laughing-stock to all the school--
261,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"But frequent changes please the crowd,"
262,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,So lengthy reign was not allowed;
263,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And when one master had his hour,"
264,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Another took the rod of power;
265,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And thus they changed to suit the case,"
266,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Till many filled the honored place.
267,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
268,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
269,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
270,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,So taken up was every mind
271,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"With fun and study well combined,"
272,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
273,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
274,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
275,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"They noticed not the hours depart,"
276,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Until the sun commenced to dart
277,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"A sheaf of lances, long and bright,"
278,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,Above the distant mountain height;
279,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"Then from the schoolroom, in a heap,"
280,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"They jumped and tumbled, twenty deep,"
281,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,In eager haste to disappear
282,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,In deepest shades of forests near.
283,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
284,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"When next the children gathered there,"
285,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"With wondering faces fresh and fair,"
286,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"It took an hour of morning prime,"
287,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"According to the teacher's time,"
288,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"To get the books in place once more,"
289,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,And order to the room restore.
290,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"So great had been the haste to hide,"
291,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,The windows were left open wide;
292,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,"And scholars knew, without a doubt,"
293,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,That Brownies had been thereabout.
294,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
295,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,[Illustration]
296,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,

301,THE BROWNIES AT SCHOOL.,
302,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.
303,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
304,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
305,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,ONE night a cunning Brownie band
306,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Was roaming through a farmer's land,"
307,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And while the rogues went prying 'round,"
308,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,The farmer's mare at rest they found;
309,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And peeping through the stable-door,"
310,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,They saw the harness that she wore.
311,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"The sight was tempting to the eye,"
312,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,For there the cart was standing nigh.
313,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
314,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
315,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
316,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"""That mare,"" said one, ""deserves her feed--"
317,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Believe me, she's no common breed;"
318,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Her grit is good: I've seen her dash
319,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Up yonder slope without the lash,"
320,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Until her load--a ton of hay--
321,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Went bouncing in beside the bay.
322,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"In this same cart, old Farmer Gill"
323,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Takes all his corn and wheat to mill;
324,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"It must be strong, though rude and rough;"
325,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"It runs on wheels, and that's enough."""
326,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
327,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
328,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
329,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Now, Brownies seldom idle stand"
330,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,When there's a chance for fun at hand.
331,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
332,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
333,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
334,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,So plans were laid without delay;
335,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"The mare was dragged from oats and hay,"
336,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"The harness from the peg they drew,"
337,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,And every one to action flew.
338,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,It was a sight one should behold
339,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"To see them working, young and old;"
340,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Two wrinkled elves, like leather browned,"
341,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Whose beards descended near the ground,"
342,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Along with youngsters did their best
343,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,With all the ardor of the rest.
344,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
345,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
346,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
347,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"While some prepared a rein or trace,"
348,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Another slid the bit in place;
349,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"More buckled bands with all their might,"
350,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Or drew the harness close and tight.
351,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
352,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
353,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
354,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"When every strap a buckle found,"
355,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And every part was safe and sound,"
356,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Then 'round the cart the Brownies flew,--"
357,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,The hardest task was yet to do.
358,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"It often puzzles bearded men,"
359,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Though o'er and o'er performed again.
360,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
361,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Some held the shafts to steer them straight,"
362,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"More did their best to balance weight,"
363,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,While others showed both strength and art
364,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,In backing Mag into the cart.
365,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"At length the heavy job was done,"
366,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,And horse and cart moved off as one.
367,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
368,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
369,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
370,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Now down the road the gentle steed
371,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Was forced to trot at greatest speed.
372,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
373,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
374,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
375,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,A merrier crowd than journeyed there
376,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Was never seen at Dublin Fair.
377,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Some found a seat, while others stood,"
378,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Or hung behind as best they could;
379,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"While many, strung along, astride,"
380,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Upon the mare enjoyed the ride.
381,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
382,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
383,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
384,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"The night was dark, the lucky elves"
385,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Had all the turnpike to themselves.
386,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"No surly keeper barred the way,"
387,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"For use of road demanding pay,"
388,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Nor were they startled by the cry
389,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Of robbers shouting, ""Stand or die!"""
390,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Across the bridge and up the hill
391,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And through the woods to Warren's mill,--"
392,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"A lengthy ride, ten miles at least,--"
393,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Without a rest they drove the beast,"
394,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,And then were loath enough to rein
395,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Old Mag around for home again.
396,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
397,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
398,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
399,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Nor was the speed, returning, slow;"
400,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"The mare was more inclined to go,"
401,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Because the feed of oats and hay
402,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Unfinished in her manger lay.
403,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,So through the yard she wheeled her load
404,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,As briskly as she took the road.
405,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,No time remained to then undo
406,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,The many straps which tight they drew.
407,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,For in the east the reddening sky
408,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Gave warning that the sun was nigh.
409,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
410,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
411,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
412,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
413,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
414,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,The halter rope was quickly wound
415,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,About the nearest post they found;
416,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Then off they scampered, left and right,"
417,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,And disappeared at once from sight.
418,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
419,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,[Illustration]
420,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,
421,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,When Farmer Gill that morning fair
422,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"Came out and viewed his jaded mare,"
423,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,I may not here in verse repeat
424,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,His exclamations all complete.
425,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"He gnashed his teeth, and glared around,"
426,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And struck his fists, and stamped the ground,"
427,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"And chased the dog across the farm,"
428,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Because it failed to give alarm.
429,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"""I'd give a stack of hay,"" he cried,"
430,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"""To catch the rogue who stole the ride!"""
431,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,"But still awry suspicion flew,--"
432,THE BROWNIES' RIDE.,Who stole the ride he never knew.

441,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,
442,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,"ONE night, when the cold moon hung low"
443,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,And winter wrapped the world in snow
444,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,And bridged the streams in wood and field
445,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,"With ice as smooth as shining shield,"
446,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,Some skaters swept in graceful style
447,THE BROWNIES ON SKATES.,"The glistening surface, file on file."

1365,THE BROWNIES TOBOGGANING,"Oft moves with pleasure, hand in hand,"
