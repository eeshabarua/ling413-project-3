42,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,
43,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"OOTS is our baby. He is a queer one too; up early, and always in dread"
44,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"of bed-time. One morning, not long ago, we heard him singing, and on"
45,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"looking for him, found the little rogue in the very middle of our best"
46,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"bed in the guest chamber, where he was playing hand-organ with a long"
47,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,hairpin put through the pretty pillow covers which had just come home
48,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"from the laundry. There he sat singing a droll medley of ""Uncle Ned,"""
49,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"""Blessed Desus,"" and ""Down in the Coal Mine."" He had been watching two"
50,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"soldiers with a hand-organ, and Toots likes to do everything he sees"
51,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"done. While we were putting the guest-room in order, Toots marched out"
52,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"as a blind man, with his eyes shut and a cane in his hand. This brought"
53,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"him to grief, for he was picked up at the foot of the stairs with two"
54,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,large bumps on his pretty white brow. Toots was quiet then for a little
55,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"while, a very little while, for as soon as we decided that his bones"
56,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"were all sound and a doctor need not be called, he ""played sick,"" and"
57,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"asked for ""shicken brof"" and toast."
58,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,
59,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"One night mamma was imprudent, for she said to a visitor, who was"
60,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"praising the little fellow, ""Oh, yes, Toots is always lovely and gentle"
61,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"at bed-time."" That very night while mamma was resting on the lounge, and"
62,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"her friend was chatting, both ladies heard a mysterious clicking. ""It"
63,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"can't be Toots,"" said mamma; ""his eyes were closed when I left him."""
64,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"Then the clicking came again louder than ever, and suddenly a crash as"
65,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"of breaking glass. Mamma sprang up at once, and there was Toots seated"
66,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,on a bath-tub driving for dear life with two of his best sashes for
67,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"reins. He had fastened one on each side of the mirror, and in his"
68,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"eagerness to drive fast, had tumbled down toilet-bottles, cushions, and"
69,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,all the pretty things his mamma loved to see. Toots was playing circus.
70,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"Barnum had been in town the day before, and Toots had made a grand"
71,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"procession with chairs, books, bottles, pictures, and everything his"
72,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"little hands could reach. Such a happy, beaming face was never seen"
73,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"before. ""Why, Toots, I thought you were asleep,"" said mamma. ""No, I hab"
74,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"too much to do, my 'cession is coming up street fast."""
75,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,
76,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"When he was quite small, Toots used to spend hours in the garden safely"
77,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,fastened into the standing stool which his grandpa had when a little
78,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"boy. The little fellow's face was so bright, and his large eyes so full"
79,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,"of innocent fun, that no one could be angry with Toots even when he did"
80,HOW TOOTS WENT TO BED.,very strange and unexpected things.

88,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,
89,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"|WHEN Toots was old enough to enter a little school, his mamma said he"
90,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"must go to a Kindergarten, which, you all know, is a delightful place"
91,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,for all children. Our good German friends first thought of it for their
92,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"little people, and here in America we have found it an excellent fashion"
93,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"to follow. Block building, song singing, and drawing with pretty things"
94,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"in needlework, and forms in clay, not only teach the children to think"
95,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"but to do, and good thinking must always come before well doing, Toots'"
96,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"mamma knew a kind German lady who understood teaching the little ones,"
97,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,and after some delay a school was opened and Toots was a pupil. He cried
98,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"hard at first. He was afraid of strangers, and he dreaded to speak aloud"
99,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"before them, although he was such a rogue at home. His mamma bought him"
100,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"a pretty lunch basket and put in it some little cakes for his lunch, and"
101,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,then they rode away in the horse car to the schoolroom. After the first
102,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"day Toots was always ready to go. ""It is only play,"" he said. But it"
103,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"was more than play, for every night Toots had something new to tell;"
104,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"sometimes he had watered the plants in the school-room, sometimes he"
105,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"talked of cubes and triangles, sometimes he sang a little song. Toots"
106,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"was learning without knowing it, and all the time he was very happy. No"
107,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"one was allowed to say a naughty word, no one was ever rude or unkind,"
108,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,and all the little eyes and hands were trained.
109,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,
110,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,[Illustration: 0016]
111,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,
112,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,When Toots told his grandma about the seed germ of a plant and how
113,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"it grew she said, ""Ah, I wish I could have gone to such a school; the"
114,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"children are very fortunate now a days."" One day Toots brought his"
115,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"grandma a pretty book-mark he had worked, and he could tell the names of"
116,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,all the colors in it and the names of the stitches. Such pretty things
117,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"as he made in clay, such dainty shapes and forms, it really was quite"
118,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,wonderful to see them and hear the little fellow in kilt skirts talk
119,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,about them. One day Toots did not come home from the Kindergarten as
120,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,usual. His favorite car driver shook his head as he passed the house.
121,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,Toots had not come out to ride home with him. Grandma was much worried.
122,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"""Never mind,"" said mamma, ""he is quite safe, perhaps they are all out"
123,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"for walk, or studying the trees or flowers in the garden; he will come"
124,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"in the next car, for his teacher always puts him on herself."" When the"
125,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"next car came, there was the little boy, smiling and happy. The children"
126,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"had taken a long walk with their teacher, and when they returned Toots"
127,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"had fallen asleep, so the kind teacher would not disturb him, and the"
128,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,little fellow was well rested.
129,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,
130,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,After dinner he had a long story to tell about the lungs of plants
131,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"and the edges of leaves, which were like little saws, and a pretty"
132,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"pitcher-plant he had seen. When his story was complete he added, ""All my"
133,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"children shall go to a Kindergarten, for it is the nicest place in the"
134,TOOTS AT THE KINDERGARTEN.,"world 'cept mamma's room."""

143,THE HAPPY HOUR.,VERY night just before bedtime Toots and his mamma had a happy hour
144,THE HAPPY HOUR.,together.
145,THE HAPPY HOUR.,
146,THE HAPPY HOUR.,Sometimes a friend or two would share the pleasures of this evening
147,THE HAPPY HOUR.,"hour, and Toots enjoyed it much more if Bessie or Flossie, or some of"
148,THE HAPPY HOUR.,"his mates, could hear mamma's stories or verses written expressly for"
149,THE HAPPY HOUR.,children. When Toots was quite small he was rude enough one day to
150,THE HAPPY HOUR.,"strike his nurse, and after mamma had heard all the story, she read"

228,ELFIE.,
229,ELFIE.,MONG Toots' friends was a little girl whose name was Elfie. She lived
230,ELFIE.,"just across the way, and her papa's garden joined that of Toots' mamma."
231,ELFIE.,"There was a large gate, between the gardens, and the children went back"
232,ELFIE.,"and forth in the summer. They seldom quarrelled, and both children were"
233,ELFIE.,glad to share their playthings. When Toots had the scarlet fever and
234,ELFIE.,"was shut up in a room with his mamma and nurse, Elfie cried to have the"
235,ELFIE.,"fever too, so she could see him. It was summer time when Toots was sick,"
236,ELFIE.,and sometimes when he was tired and restless he would moan so Elfie
237,ELFIE.,could hear him in the garden. One day when it was very warm and every
238,ELFIE.,"one was tired and cross, Auntie bathed Elfie and put her on the bed, but"
239,ELFIE.,she did not stay there long; she began to think of Toots--how warm he
240,ELFIE.,"must be, how tired of the bed and that ugly dark room. Suddenly Elfie"
241,ELFIE.,remembered that people used to bring her mamma pretty flowers when she
242,ELFIE.,was ill.
243,ELFIE.,
244,ELFIE.,[Illustration: 0022]
245,ELFIE.,
246,ELFIE.,Perhaps she might carry Toots some flowers; her auntie was fast asleep
247,ELFIE.,"and the nurse was out. Yes, she would go into the garden and get the"
248,ELFIE.,prettiest flowers there for poor Toots. She had no shoes--auntie had put
249,ELFIE.,them away--and no stockings; but it would not matter; plenty of children
250,ELFIE.,"never had shoes or stockings, and it could not hurt very much, for they"
251,ELFIE.,could run.
252,ELFIE.,
253,ELFIE.,Just then a low moan was heard and that decided Elfie; she sprang up and
254,ELFIE.,"ran down stairs; no one was in sight but Touser, and he was such a good"
255,ELFIE.,"dog, he only lapped her bare feet with his tongue, so little Elfie went"
256,ELFIE.,into the garden and began to gather flowers.
257,ELFIE.,
258,ELFIE.,"Presently she heard another moan from the sick-room, and she ran as fast"
259,ELFIE.,as she could through the gate and up to the door. One of the servants
260,ELFIE.,"was just coming out. ""Why, little Elfie!"" said she, ""you will hurt those"
261,ELFIE.,"poor bare feet and you must not come here now, did any one send you?"""
262,ELFIE.,
263,ELFIE.,"""No, I runned away,'coz I wanted Toots to have some flowers, and I wish"
264,ELFIE.,"I could have the fever too, and be sick with him."""
265,ELFIE.,
266,ELFIE.,"""Poor child!"" said the maid, ""Master Toots shall have your flowers and"
267,ELFIE.,"he is better to-day, only the great heat makes him moan; wait here a bit"
268,ELFIE.,"until I send them up to his room and then I will take you home."""
269,ELFIE.,
270,ELFIE.,The flowers were carried to the sick-room and Toots smiled when they
271,ELFIE.,"told him what his little friend said. ""Tell her not to wish for the"
272,ELFIE.,"fever,"" he said, ""for I feel as if I were on fire, and there is no cool"
273,ELFIE.,place in the bed; but when I am well again we will play together at the
274,ELFIE.,"fountain and keep our store as we used to."" Elfie was very happy when"
275,ELFIE.,"she heard this message, and after that she sent flowers to the sick boy"
276,ELFIE.,every day.

285,PAUL BROWN.,HEN Toots first went to the Kindergarten he met there a little boy whose
286,PAUL BROWN.,"name was Paul Brown. He was a very bright little fellow, but he could"
287,PAUL BROWN.,not talk as well as Toots; some of his words were cut short and it
288,PAUL BROWN.,"sounded very cunning, for Paul did his best and the Kindergarten teacher"
289,PAUL BROWN.,told the boys and girls that no one could do better than his best. One
290,PAUL BROWN.,day a little baby sister came to Paul's house and this is the story he
291,PAUL BROWN.,told his grandpa when the old gentleman came in to see the stranger:

599,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
600,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"HEN Toots was four years old, his mamma thought she would let him have a"
601,A BUBBLE PARTY.,birthday party. She wrote the invitations on the prettiest little
602,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"paper, with funny frogs and dogs and cats in the corner, and each"
603,A BUBBLE PARTY.,little envelope was made to match. Twenty-five pretty little notes to
604,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"twenty-five dear little people, and every one came. No one else ever had"
605,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"such a party before. Large tables were covered with books and toys,"
606,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"all manner of games were waiting to be played, and in one corner of the"
607,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"children's play-room was a table with bowls, plates, and pipes, and all"
608,A BUBBLE PARTY.,the children were invited to blow bubbles. Such fun as they had! Some
609,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"blew large and some blew small, and those who laughed hard blew none at"
610,A BUBBLE PARTY.,all. At last Toots and Robbie Mason began to see something in the soap
611,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"bubble, ""beautiful colors like the rainbow,"" said Toots."
612,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
613,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"""More of them,"" said Robbie, and then all the children began to wonder."
614,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
615,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"""What makes it?"" asked Robbie, eagerly; ""I wish I knew?"""
616,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
617,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"""I will tell you,"" said mamma. ""When a ray of light is divided, as it"
618,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"always is when it reaches an object on which to rest, it has different"
619,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"colors, because each color has different powers and is refracted or"
620,A BUBBLE PARTY.,turned from its course. Let us cast a ray of light on this piece
621,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"of glass called a prism; now examine it closely, here we have seven"
622,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"colors--red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet The red is"
623,A BUBBLE PARTY.,bent out of its course the least and it remains at the bottom; the blue
624,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"is refracted most and goes to the top. Now blow a nice bubble, little"
625,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"Daisy, and I will explain the colors. You see the film is thicker"
626,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"in some places than in others, and that causes different powers of"
627,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"refraction or turning aside of the rays, and therefore, you observe"
628,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"different colors; as the soap bubble constantly changes its thickness,"
629,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"the rays vary or change also."""
630,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
631,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"""There isn't any soap in the real rainbow in the clouds, is there?"""
632,A BUBBLE PARTY.,asked thoughtful Robbie.
633,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
634,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"""Oh, no; when the clouds opposite the sun are dark and rain is still"
635,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"falling, the rays of the bright sun are divided by the rain drops as"
636,A BUBBLE PARTY.,"they would be here with my prism."" #"
637,A BUBBLE PARTY.,
638,A BUBBLE PARTY.,After the children grew tired of bubbles they had many games and a nice

744,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,LL Toots' playmates among the boys and girls knew how very fond he was
745,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"of his four-footed friends, and the children were very fond of watching"
746,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,him when he made his pets perform all sorts of tricks. Poor Toots
747,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,was nearly ill one day when one of his pet cats was found dead in the

768,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"little head peeping out of the bosom of his night-gown, and then she"
769,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"slept a long, long time. Toots was much troubled to find a pretty name"
770,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"for her. At last he said, ""poor little Pussy, we cannot find a name"
771,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"good enough or sweet enough for you."" His mamma said suppose we call her"
772,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,_Psyche._ This pleased Toots very much and the new kitty was duly named

774,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,lived in Toots' room and nestled close to him. As she grew older she
775,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,grew wiser and very full of fun. All summer long she chased flies and
776,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"grasshoppers, and when the children played ball, Pysche understood it"
777,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,all and took her place properly. She has two very cunning tricks--one
778,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,was to never enter a door if she could make some one open a window to
779,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"let her in, and the other was to hide away at bedtime and then come out"
780,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,to play when all the house was still. In the summer time Pysche went to
781,A FOUR-FOOTED FRIEND.,"the seaside with the family, where she was a great pet with the grown-up"

1012,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1013,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,LIVER TWIST was the name of a fine rooster or gamecock which belonged to
1014,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"Toots' grandpa, and many were the stories told of him. He became quite"
1015,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"famous in the family, and out of it, and none of the children wanted"
1016,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,him killed or sold even if he grew too old to walk. When grandpa bought
1017,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"Oliver he carried him home between his knees in the carriage, while he"
1018,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"drove Frisk, the pony. Toots' mamma sat by his side with a huge basket"
1019,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,in her lap containing a fine old mother hen with ten little chicks. They
1020,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"were all going into grandpa's coop at the farm, and then he would take"
1021,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,care of them for Toots.
1022,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1023,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"""I suppose I have been very foolish to pay such a price for this"
1024,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"fellow,"" said grandpa, ""but he is smart enough to peck pretty hard."""
1025,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1026,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,All the way to the farm the new rooster made himself as disagreeable as
1027,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"he could, now biting grandpa's hands, and now his knees, until the"
1028,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,dear old man wished he had never seen him. At last he was safe in
1029,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"the hen-house, where he soon began to eat, and, as he never seemed"
1030,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"satisfied, he was called Oliver Twist."
1031,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1032,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"""There has been an old fox about here stealing chicks,"" said the hired"
1033,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"man, ""but this Oliver will tackle him, I reckon."""
1034,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1035,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,The hired man was right. Only a few days after grandpa heard a great
1036,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"noise among the poultry, and there was a large fox trying to get into"
1037,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,the chicken-yard from the barn. Grandpa stole softly into the house and
1038,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,got his gun. When he went back Oliver was pecking at the head and eyes
1039,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,of the fox with all his might. Oliver was very angry but did not show
1040,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"any signs of fear, while the fox tried in vain to get nearer. At last"
1041,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,the old fox made up his mind to spring over and eat chicken for his
1042,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"lunch, but just then, bang! went grandpa's gun, and the sly enemy"
1043,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,tumbled over on the barn floor.
1044,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1045,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"When Oliver heard the gun he thought he was shot too, for he fell down"
1046,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"and closed his eyes. When grandpa petted and praised him, and held out a"
1047,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"dish of corn, he seemed to think better of it, and began to strut about,"
1048,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,while all the hens cackled in chorus and seemed very proud of their
1049,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,defender.
1050,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,
1051,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,Poor Oliver met with an accident during the cold winter weather; his
1052,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,beautiful red comb was frozen and fell off. He seemed so ashamed of it
1053,OLIVER TWIST AT HOME.,"that he could not or would not hold up his head, but a nice new comb has"

1066,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,P at grandpa's farm the chicks were very happy since the old fox was
1067,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"killed, and as Toots wanted some more cunning little ones to play with"
1068,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"and feed when he went up for a visit, grandpa decided to put some eggs"
1069,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"under Mrs. White. Now, Mrs. White was a very fine hen, and although she"
1070,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"had never raised any chicks of her own, she seemed so kind and gentle"
1071,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,that grandpa was sure she would make a kind mother. He selected the eggs
1072,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"with great care, marking some very choice ones with a blue pencil. Mrs."
1073,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"White sat very quietly upon her nest for many days, until it was time"
1074,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,for the little chicks to come out of their shell houses; then grandpa
1075,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"paid her a visit. Three little ones were already toddling about, and"
1076,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,Mrs. White seemed to be in great distress concerning some others who
1077,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,were just trying to see what the world was made of. Grandpa helped the
1078,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"little fellows by picking away small bits of the shell, and then he"
1079,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"hurried away to make some nice dough for them. When he returned, Mrs."
1080,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"White was nowhere to be seen, so grandpa covered the little new babies"
1081,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,with some wool and then looked for the neglectful mother. He soon found
1082,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,her in the yard with Oliver Twist and a large flock of hens.

1088,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"for a few moments while grandpa was there, and then ran away again."
1089,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,
1090,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"Grandpa tried shutting her up, but still she hurt her little chicks"
1091,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"and at last killed one. Then grandpa told her she was a cruel, wicked"
1092,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"mother, and he carried the chicks into the kitchen and covered them over"
1093,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,in a nice warm basket. There they nestled for several days until they
1094,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,began to hop out and get under grandma's feet. After that they had a
1095,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,little house in the shed and soon grew very fast. Toots called them the
1096,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"orphans, and never again liked Mrs. White, although she was so handsome."
1097,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,Soon after this grandpa put some eggs under a queer old hen which all
1098,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"the family called Mrs. Gummidge, she was so cross and queer. When her"
1099,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,chicks came she was a very kind mother and scratched for them all day
1100,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"long. She was very proud of them, too, and seemed to say, ""Did you ever"
1101,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"see such little darlings?"" Mrs. Gummidge went about with her children"
1102,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"until they were large enough to take care of themselves, and then she"
1103,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,"sat quietly on some more eggs and raised another family, but none of"
1104,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,them ever seemed quite so precious to Toots as the little neglected
1105,MRS. WHITE'S FAMILY.,chicks of Mrs. White.

1218,THE COMMISSARY.,COMMISSARY is one who furnishes supplies of food to an army or body of

1220,THE COMMISSARY.,"the boarding-school where Toots' mamma went when a little girl, and his"
1221,THE COMMISSARY.,owner was the lady who kept the school. Her son brought him home one day
1222,THE COMMISSARY.,"and taught him many tricks. Every day he went to market for the family,"
1223,THE COMMISSARY.,"and it was great fun for the younger girls to see ""Captain Com"" go out"
1224,THE COMMISSARY.,with his basket in his mouth. His errands were always faithfully done.
1225,THE COMMISSARY.,"No boy ever dared to meddle with Com, and although he went five blocks"
1226,THE COMMISSARY.,to market no one ever tried to get his note out of the basket. Every
1227,THE COMMISSARY.,morning he waited until madam consulted with cook and wrote down the
1228,THE COMMISSARY.,"order, and then when it was put into his care he would trot away in a"
1229,THE COMMISSARY.,"very happy frame of mind. ""Com"" was very good to the younger pupils. He"
1230,THE COMMISSARY.,"would let them drive him in a little cart, or play tag with them by the"
1231,THE COMMISSARY.,"hour. Once in the vacation, when nearly all the pupils had gone home,"

1254,THE COMMISSARY.,would kindly wait upon him. Sometimes his bag would be full of letters

1625,DADDY TOUGH.,
1626,DADDY TOUGH.,"T was a queer, very queer name, but the soldiers gave it to him, and"
1627,DADDY TOUGH.,when you hear how he conducted himself you will not wonder. Daddy Tough
1628,DADDY TOUGH.,"lived in a fort in the western country, and he belonged to the United"
1629,DADDY TOUGH.,"States Government. On one side he had the letters ""U. S."" branded, in"
1630,DADDY TOUGH.,order to keep people from stealing him. The children in the fort all
1631,DADDY TOUGH.,"called those letters ""Uncle Sam,"" and everything with that mark on it"
1632,DADDY TOUGH.,"was said to belong to Uncle Sam, meaning the Government."
1633,DADDY TOUGH.,
1634,DADDY TOUGH.,The children about the fort used to ride on his back in a sort of double
1635,DADDY TOUGH.,saddle made of willow. One day the soldiers took him inside of a small
1636,DADDY TOUGH.,gate in order to remove some ashes from a cellar. The cart was backed in
1637,DADDY TOUGH.,and Daddy stood with his head just outside of the gate. He looked like
1638,DADDY TOUGH.,a droll picture in a frame. There he stood winking his eyes and shaking
1639,DADDY TOUGH.,his long ears. When the soldiers had the ashes all in the wagon they
1640,DADDY TOUGH.,"told Daddy to go on, but he would not move; then they coaxed him but he"
1641,DADDY TOUGH.,"did not stir. His driver pelted and pulled, but Daddy winked and never"
1642,DADDY TOUGH.,moved a step.
1643,DADDY TOUGH.,
1644,DADDY TOUGH.,"""We must get him away somehow,"" said the soldiers, and at last they"
1645,DADDY TOUGH.,"struck him. Daddy looked at them in the most reproachful manner, but he"
1646,DADDY TOUGH.,did not move an inch. For more than half an hour the poor soldiers tried
1647,DADDY TOUGH.,to have him carry his burden away.

1649,DADDY TOUGH.,"""We must be all cleared up before dress parade,"" said one."

1657,DADDY TOUGH.,"you will disgrace the command."""
1658,DADDY TOUGH.,
1659,DADDY TOUGH.,"Daddy looked knowing, but still stood firm. Other soldiers came and"
1660,DADDY TOUGH.,"they tried, but Daddy would not yield even after hard whipping. Then"
1661,DADDY TOUGH.,"the colonel came out and told them what to do, but Daddy winked at the"
1662,DADDY TOUGH.,"colonel as if to say, ""I like this place very much and I will not go"
1663,DADDY TOUGH.,"even for you."""
1664,DADDY TOUGH.,
1665,DADDY TOUGH.,"When all efforts had failed the colonel's wife said,"

1671,DADDY TOUGH.,The lady brought out some sugar and gave Daddy a taste. He shook his
1672,DADDY TOUGH.,ears and made a sort of grunt. Then she patted him and held it farther
1673,DADDY TOUGH.,away and at last he marched after her out of the gate and ran so fast he
1674,DADDY TOUGH.,upset part of the ashes. After that when Daddy grew sulky a little sugar
1675,DADDY TOUGH.,would win him over.

1693,BUTTON BLUE.,"""Bocker-nickers."" He was a droll little fellow, and always managed to"

1719,BUTTON BLUE.,sprang off his horse and unlocked the door of the little house known as

1799,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,
1800,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,KIND lady and dear friend of Toots and his mother owns a bright little
1801,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,dog named Benjamina. Its mother was blind and lame when the little puppy
1802,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"was born, and the good lady thought it was the child of the dog mother's"
1803,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"old age; so she called it Benjamina, and a very cunning, wise little"
1804,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,creature she is.
1805,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,
1806,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,Benjamina likes to curl up on a sofa pillow and take life easy. Nearly
1807,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,every day she takes a walk with her mistress and frisks about here and
1808,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"there. Once when they were out walking, naughty Bennie ran too near the"
1809,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,horse car and was kicked by one of the horses. She lay quite still for
1810,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"a moment, and all who saw her feared she was dead. Before any one could"
1811,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"reach her, a large, strong dog who belonged to a neighbor sprang across"
1812,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,the street and carried her to her mistress. Poor doggie had a bad cut
1813,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"in her side which the doctor sewed up, and it was so very sore that she"
1814,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,could not lie down for many days. It was quite pitiful to see it walk
1815,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"around and around in a circle, trying to go to sleep. Old Major came"
1816,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"every day to see her, and when he was allowed to come into the room he"
1817,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"would sit down gravely and look at her. He evidently wanted to say, ""I"

1822,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,After a time poor Benjamina grew well enough to sit in a chair at the
1823,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"window, and Major would sit outside on the piazza and look at her. They"
1824,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,really seemed to understand each other perfectly. If anything went wrong
1825,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"in the street Major would run down the steps and attend to it, and then"
1826,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,come back to his station before the window. At last Bennie was taken
1827,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"out for a drive and Major ran all the way by the side of the carriage,"
1828,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,barking with pleasure.
1829,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,
1830,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"Once Bennie's mistress found a large bone put on her piazza, which Major"
1831,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"had brought for his friend's breakfast, and great was the good fellow's"
1832,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,delight when it was carried to Bennie.
1833,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,
1834,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,Major went to church every Sunday and sat in the porch until his master
1835,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,came out; he tried very hard to go inside but was never allowed to do
1836,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,so. When the sexton went out to open the doors Major would shake himself
1837,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,and take his position on the steps. Once he came on Sunday and tried to
1838,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,"coax Bennie out, but her mistress said no. When I last saw Bennie she"
1839,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,was sitting in her mistress' lap while she wrote some letters. Major is
1840,MAJOR AND BENJAMINA.,still the same faithful friend and visits her every day.

1862,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"they told the children all about it. Two little boys, Philip and"
1863,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"Harry, who lived in the cottage at the point, heard the story with much"
1864,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"pleasure; so did Toots, who wished he could see it. One morning when"
1865,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"the wind blew hard and the water was covered with white caps, Philip's"
1866,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"mother missed both her little boys. ""Perhaps they have gone over to"
1867,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"Toots',"" she said. Their sister inquired, but Toots was swinging in the"
1868,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,hammock with another little friend. He had not seen Philip or Harry all
1869,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"the morning. Then the nurse and all the family began to look, but no"
1870,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,boys could they find.
1871,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1872,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"At last an old sailor said, ""There's a little boat a-bob-bing up and"
1873,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"down out there, and I think it has two little chaps in it."""
1874,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1875,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"The ladies took a glass, and there indeed were the two little rogues"
1876,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,liable to be drowned at any moment; but two kind sailors went after them
1877,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,and brought them safe on shore.
1878,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1879,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""Where were you going?"" asked their mamma."
1880,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1881,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""To visit the Tommodore's pretty water-house."""
1882,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1883,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,Both boys were very small and could not speak distinctly.
1884,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1885,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""But how strange! you were not invited,"" said their mother."
1886,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1887,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""Oh, yes, I 'vited 'Ilip and 'Ilip Vited me!"""
1888,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1889,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""What would you have done if you had reached the yacht?""'"
1890,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1891,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""I was going to 'duce 'Ilip to the Tommodore and 'Ilip was going to"
1892,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"'duce me."""

1895,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"yourself and invited. When the Commodore invites my little boys, I will"
1896,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"take them out to his yacht and introduce them myself. Besides, the water"
1897,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"is very rough and you are too young to row a boat so far."""
1898,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,
1899,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"""We could do it;'cause 'Ilip rowed one oar and I rowed the other. We"
1900,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"like it."""

1902,THE COMMODORE'S GUESTS.,"Their mother was very glad to get them back again, and the good"
