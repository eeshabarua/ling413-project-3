138,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"As the lion is called the king of beasts, so the eagle is called the"
139,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"king of birds; but except that it is bigger, stronger, and swifter than"
140,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"other birds, there does not seem much reason for the name. It is a"
141,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"mistake to attribute noble or mean qualities to animals or birds, or to"
142,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"think they can do good or bad actions, when they can only do what God"
143,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"has created them to do, and as their instinct teaches."
144,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,
145,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"The most powerful of the eagles is the Golden Eagle, so called because"
146,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,of the rich yellowish-brown bordering to its feathers. It makes its nest
147,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"in the clefts of the rocky sides of the mountains, and seldom on a tree,"
148,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"unless where one has sprung up in between the clefts, and the tangled"
149,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"roots make a sort of platform. This the eagles cover with sticks, and"
150,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"here they make their house, living in it always, and not only when they"
151,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,lay eggs or have young ones.
152,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,
153,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"If there are eaglets in the nest, the food is at once carried home to"
154,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"them, and the skinning and eating done at home. Eagles are very"
155,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,"attentive to their young, and feed them with great care until they are"
156,THE KING OF THE CASTLE.,able to take care of themselves.

166,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"Mrs. Zebra, standing with her baby by her side, asks proudly of the"
167,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"lookers-on, ""Did you ever see such a likeness?"" and certainly mother and"
168,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"child are very much alike, striped all over their bodies, from head to"
169,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"foot, and from nose to tail, with the same regular marks of black."
170,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"Strong and wild by nature, the zebra family are left very much to"
171,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"themselves, which is a source of great happiness to the mother and child"
172,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"in the picture before us. ""No! no! my baby is not going to become as"
173,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"tame as the donkey, or to draw carts and carriages like the horse; it is"
174,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"to have its freedom, and go just where it likes all over these large"
175,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"plains;""--so says Mrs. Zebra, and she means it too, for if anybody took"
176,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"the trouble to go all the way to the hot country of Africa, where Mrs."
177,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"Zebra is at home, and tried to carry off her baby, they would find their"
178,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,"journey a vain one, and that she would kick severely, and perhaps break"
179,ZEBRA AND YOUNG.,the legs of the person bold enough to take away her darling.

189,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"This is the American black bear, who is looking so lively and seemingly"
190,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"inviting the young folks to have a romp, which they will be only too"
191,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"willing to join in. The black bear is of a timid disposition, and seldom"
192,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,attacks man except in self-defense. The female bear is a most
193,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"affectionate mother, and many stories are related showing her care and"
194,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"love for her young, and her sorrow and mournful cries when any evil"
195,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,befalls them. On one occasion a black bear with her two cubs was pursued
196,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,across the ice by some armed sailors. At first she urged her cubs to
197,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"increased speed, but finding her pursuers gaining upon them, she"
198,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,"carried, pushed, and pitched them, alternately, forward, until she"
199,MRS. BRUIN AND FAMILY.,effected their escape from her pursuers.

209,LITTLE OWLS.,Who has not at one time or other of his life read fairy tales and
210,LITTLE OWLS.,sympathized with stories of enchanted princes and princesses? I once
211,LITTLE OWLS.,thought of this when a country boy offered me a nest with four of the
212,LITTLE OWLS.,"young of the Little Owl. I put them into a large cage, where they could"
213,LITTLE OWLS.,stare at each other and at my pigeons to their hearts' content.
214,LITTLE OWLS.,
215,LITTLE OWLS.,"Let me say that this little owl is a very useful bird, for it keeps"
216,LITTLE OWLS.,"mice, bats, beetles, and other creatures in check, which might otherwise"
217,LITTLE OWLS.,multiply too fast. On a spring or summer evening you may hear its
218,LITTLE OWLS.,"plaintive hoot among the apple-blossoms of an orchard, or the sheaves of"
219,LITTLE OWLS.,"a cornfield. Curiously enough, this simple sound earned the little bird"
220,LITTLE OWLS.,"the name of being the harbinger of death, and peasants believed that"
221,LITTLE OWLS.,"whenever its cry was heard where sickness was in the family, the patient"
222,LITTLE OWLS.,was sure to die.

232,AUROCHS.,"An Aurochs in blind rage, charging through thick and thin, has had a"
233,AUROCHS.,"fascination for me as long as I can remember. The true aurochs and this,"
234,AUROCHS.,"the European Bison, ceased to exist in the British Isles, except in the"
235,AUROCHS.,"Zoological Gardens; but the latter is still found wild in Lithuania, and"
236,AUROCHS.,"is also carefully preserved in other parts of Russia, of which the"
237,AUROCHS.,Emperor has a herd. There is much talk about their being untamable--that
238,AUROCHS.,they will not mix with tame cattle--that tame cows shrink from the
239,AUROCHS.,aurochs' calves; but does not any cow shrink from any calf not her own?
240,AUROCHS.,"The American Bison, with which you are all pretty familiar, is very"
241,AUROCHS.,similar to the one just mentioned. There have been several attempts made
242,AUROCHS.,"to domesticate the American bison, and have been so far successful. The"
243,AUROCHS.,"size and strength of the animal make it probable that if domesticated,"
244,AUROCHS.,it would be of great use.

254,THE KANGAROO.,"""Well,"" said little Herbert Joyce, as he looked over the books of"
255,THE KANGAROO.,"drawings which his cousin had just brought home from Australia, ""I never"
256,THE KANGAROO.,saw anything so extraordinary before in all my life; why here is an
257,THE KANGAROO.,"animal with three heads, and two of them are very low down, and much"
258,THE KANGAROO.,"smaller than the others."" ""What do you mean, Herbert?"" asked his cousin,"
259,THE KANGAROO.,"who just then came into the room. ""There are no three-headed"
260,THE KANGAROO.,animals--let me see the picture. Oh! no wonder you were puzzled; it does
261,THE KANGAROO.,"look like a queer creature. That is a kangaroo, and the small heads"
262,THE KANGAROO.,"belong to her children, whom she carries about in a bag formed by a hole"
263,THE KANGAROO.,"in her skin, until they are old enough to walk; and the little things"
264,THE KANGAROO.,"seem very happy there; and sometimes, as their mother moves along over"
265,THE KANGAROO.,"the grass, you may see them nibbling it."""

281,THE PEACOCK.,"In heaven's hues arrayed,"
282,THE PEACOCK.,And plainer birds at sight of thee
283,THE PEACOCK.,Might shrink and be dismayed:
284,THE PEACOCK.,
285,THE PEACOCK.,"Yet, pampered bird! there still are those"
286,THE PEACOCK.,"I value higher far,"

324,SWANS.,
325,SWANS.,This beautiful and majestic bird was considered the bird-royal in
326,SWANS.,"England, owing to a law of England that when found in a partially wild"
327,SWANS.,state on the sea and navigable rivers it belonged to the crown; but of
328,SWANS.,course it is to be found on the ponds and lakes of many a gentleman's
329,SWANS.,"estate, and is always prized as a great ornament to the lake. The swan"
330,SWANS.,"is also very valuable in clearing the ponds of weeds, and makes a most"
331,SWANS.,"effective clearance, as they eat them before they rise to the surface."
332,SWANS.,The swan affords a pleasing illustration of the love of the mother-bird
333,SWANS.,"for its young, and has been known to vanquish a fox who made an attack"
334,SWANS.,on its nest--showing that the instinct of motherhood kindles boldness
335,SWANS.,and bravery in the breast of the most timid animals. The nest is
336,SWANS.,"generally made on an islet, and composed of reeds and rushes, and when"
337,SWANS.,"the five or seven large eggs are hatched, the mother may be seen"
338,SWANS.,swimming about with the young ones on her back.

350,THE SEA LION.,"legs they may be called, and is sitting on a chair with his flappers"
351,THE SEA LION.,over the back of the chair. It inhabits the eastern shores of
352,THE SEA LION.,"Kamtchatka, and is in some places extremely abundant, and measuring"
353,THE SEA LION.,"about fifteen feet in length. It is much addicted to roaring, which, as"
354,THE SEA LION.,"much as the mane of the old males, has obtained for it the name of the"
355,THE SEA LION.,"Sea Lion. The old males have a fierce appearance, yet they fly in great"
356,THE SEA LION.,"haste on the approach of man, but if driven to extremities they will"
357,THE SEA LION.,"fight desperately; but in captivity they are capable of being tamed, and"
358,THE SEA LION.,become very familiar with man. The scientific name of the sea lion is

402,BADGERS.,much a wild animal goes through till it has got used to a state of
403,BADGERS.,things so opposite to its natural habits. Their wants are attended to as
404,BADGERS.,"much as possible, but cannot be always met; and so we have here a"
405,BADGERS.,"devoted mother, worn out by the demands of her cubs, and vainly anxious"
406,BADGERS.,to hide herself from daylight and man's gaze. She has long given up
407,BADGERS.,trying to dig or scratch her way out. All she can do is to lean against
408,BADGERS.,"the wall, ready for a last defence, should anybody come within her"
409,BADGERS.,"prison. She dares not curl up into a ball, like the one cub, and go to"
410,BADGERS.,"sleep; while this little careless imp on her back, happy and trustful,"
411,BADGERS.,adds to her tiredness by his weight.

425,THE BIRD'S NEST.,
426,THE BIRD'S NEST.,How curious is the structure of the nest of the Bullfinch or Chaffinch!
427,THE BIRD'S NEST.,The inside of it is lined with cotton and fine silken threads; and the
428,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"outside cannot be sufficiently admired, though it is composed only of"
429,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"various kinds of fine moss. The color of these mosses, resembling that"
430,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"of the bark of the tree in which the nest is built, proves that the bird"
431,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"intended it should not be easily discovered. In some nests, hair, wool,"
432,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"and rushes are cleverly interwoven. In others, the parts are firmly"
433,THE BIRD'S NEST.,"fastened by a thread, which the bird makes of hemp, wool, hair, or, more"

815,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,"rims of the gutter, twisting their little heads, opening their"
816,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,"yellow-lined beaks, singing to their hearts' content. Whole families"
817,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,"would perch there together, or the young would rest in rows of four or"
818,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,"five, according to the nest-broods of each. How delightful to see them"
819,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,fed by their agile parents! how tantalizing to have them almost within
820,THE SWALLOW'S NEST.,"reach of my hands, yet not to be able to catch them or give them a kiss,"

2077,THE OTTER.,
2078,THE OTTER.,The Otter belongs to a class of animals which we may call the Weasel
2079,THE OTTER.,"tribe. Their bodies are long and lithe, and their legs short. This"
2080,THE OTTER.,"family includes the weasel (its smallest member), the stoat, the ferret,"
2081,THE OTTER.,"the pole-cat, the marten, and the otter (its largest member). You may"
2082,THE OTTER.,"then think of the Otter as a water-ferret, or water-weasel. He can swim"
2083,THE OTTER.,"most elegantly, and he is a beautiful diver. Let a fish glide underneath"
2084,THE OTTER.,"him, and he is after it in a moment; and as the fish darts here and"
2085,THE OTTER.,"there to escape, the Otter follows each rapid movement with unerring"
2086,THE OTTER.,"precision. When the fish is caught, the Otter carries it to the bank and"
2087,THE OTTER.,makes a meal. But the Otter is like naughty Jack who leaves a saucy
2088,THE OTTER.,plate--he spoils much more fish than he eats. The trout and other fish
2089,THE OTTER.,"are so much alarmed at the appearance of an Otter, that they will"
2090,THE OTTER.,sometimes fling themselves on the bank to get out of his way.

2102,THE MASTIFF.,all dogs this is the most vigilant watcher over the property of his

2104,THE MASTIFF.,"him. Notwithstanding his commanding appearance, and the strictness with"
2105,THE MASTIFF.,"which he guards the property of his master, the mastiff is possessed of"
2106,THE MASTIFF.,"great mildness of character, and is very grateful for any favors"
2107,THE MASTIFF.,bestowed upon him. I once went into the barn of a friend where there was
2108,THE MASTIFF.,"a mastiff chained; I went up to the dog and patted him on the head, when"

2112,THE MASTIFF.,"but had I shown any fear, and hastily removed my hand, I might have"

2146,SEA REPTILES.,"illustrations. One of them has been named the Ichthyosaurus, which means"
2147,SEA REPTILES.,"Fish Reptile. Its head somewhat resembled that of the crocodile, except"
2148,SEA REPTILES.,"that the orbit was much larger, and had the nostril placed close to it,"
2149,SEA REPTILES.,"as in the whale, and not near the end of the snout. It had four paddles"
2150,SEA REPTILES.,"and a powerful tail, and was very active in its movements and a rapid"
