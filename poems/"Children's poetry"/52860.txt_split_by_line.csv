107,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
108,CONTENTS,
109,CONTENTS,His real name was Willy. But because he was always on the look-out for
110,CONTENTS,"any fun or mischief, Father and Mother called him “Wideawake” as well."
111,CONTENTS,
112,CONTENTS,One sunny day he and his little friends went out to play cricket.
113,CONTENTS,
114,CONTENTS,"“I'm going to make a hundred runs!” cried Willy, as he took up the bat."
115,CONTENTS,"But when he had made ten, Freddy bowled him out, and the other boys were"
116,CONTENTS,glad it was their turn to go in.
117,CONTENTS,
118,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
119,CONTENTS,
120,CONTENTS,"In the winter, father made a big slide, and Willy and the boys went down"
121,CONTENTS,"it as fast as they could go. When he fell half way down, Willy thought"
122,CONTENTS,"it great fun, and called to his snowman as he glided past, “Look at me"
123,CONTENTS,old fellow! Don't _you_ wish you could slide?”
124,CONTENTS,
125,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
126,CONTENTS,
127,CONTENTS,On his birthday he had a party. It _was_ a merry time. They played
128,CONTENTS,"“Blind Man's Buff,” and “Puss in the Corner,” and Willy always managed"
129,CONTENTS,to catch the little girls by their long curls.
130,CONTENTS,
131,CONTENTS,It was spring when Wideawake Willy went exploring. He shot his Teddy
132,CONTENTS,"Bear, and tied it up in a scarlet handkerchief, for he knew explorers"
133,CONTENTS,"ate bears. Then he stuck a long feather in his hat, and strode gaily"
134,CONTENTS,"down the road. Presently he came to a big house. The door was open, and"
135,CONTENTS,a lady asked him to go in. She showed him all sorts of wonderful things.
136,CONTENTS,"What he liked best was Chin Chan, the Chinese boy, whose long pig-tail"
137,CONTENTS,"touched the floor. The lady told Willy that in China he lived in a boat,"
138,CONTENTS,and helped his mother look after the chickens.
139,CONTENTS,
140,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
141,CONTENTS,
142,CONTENTS,"After seeing other Chinese people, he went home and told his mother what"
143,CONTENTS,strange things he had seen.

151,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
152,CONTENTS,
153,CONTENTS,"There was an old Woman,"
154,CONTENTS,And what do you think?
155,CONTENTS,She lived upon nothing but
156,CONTENTS,Victuals and drink;
157,CONTENTS,And though victuals and drink
158,CONTENTS,"Were the chief of her diet,"
159,CONTENTS,This little Old Woman could never be quiet.
160,CONTENTS,
161,CONTENTS,This little Old Woman (the story so goes)
162,CONTENTS,Had nothing to wear but
163,CONTENTS,Abundance of clothes.
164,CONTENTS,"And, oh, let me weep"
165,CONTENTS,"At the dismal news,"
166,CONTENTS,"She would have been barefooted, but for her shoes."
167,CONTENTS,
168,CONTENTS,"This Little Old Woman,"
169,CONTENTS,"Twas always the case,"
170,CONTENTS,Never looked in the glass
171,CONTENTS,But she saw her own face;
172,CONTENTS,"And what was still worse,"
173,CONTENTS,"Yet, we vouch for its truth,"
174,CONTENTS,"By growing so old, she had lost all her youth."

178,CONTENTS,[Illustration]
179,CONTENTS,
180,CONTENTS,"This Little Old Woman,"
181,CONTENTS,"The tale too declares,"
182,CONTENTS,Had nothing to sit on
183,CONTENTS,But sofas and chairs.
184,CONTENTS,No place to repose in
185,CONTENTS,At night but her bed;
186,CONTENTS,"No pillows, but those made of down, for her head."
187,CONTENTS,
188,CONTENTS,"This Little Old Woman,"
189,CONTENTS,"We here may remark,"
190,CONTENTS,"Had no house to live in,"
191,CONTENTS,"But one in the park,"
192,CONTENTS,"And none to wait on her,"
193,CONTENTS,"Poor soul, but her maids,"
194,CONTENTS,With some livery servants of different grades.
195,CONTENTS,
196,CONTENTS,"This Little Old Woman,"
197,CONTENTS,"I'm sorry to tell,"
198,CONTENTS,"Had always bad health,"
199,CONTENTS,When she was not quite well.
200,CONTENTS,"And hard was her lot,"
201,CONTENTS,For they tell me that she
202,CONTENTS,Was ever in want
203,CONTENTS,When she wanted her tea.
204,CONTENTS,
205,CONTENTS,"This Little Old Woman,"
206,CONTENTS,"On dying, we find,"
207,CONTENTS,Left nothing—except
208,CONTENTS,"A large fortune, behind."
209,CONTENTS,"So pity her fate,"
210,CONTENTS,"Gentle reader, and say,"
211,CONTENTS,Such women are not to be found every day.

274,C.M. RUTLEY.,There were seven froggies of Lee
275,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Who were happy as happy could be,"
276,C.M. RUTLEY.,Till a duck close by
277,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Just winked his eye,"

285,C.M. RUTLEY.,"He snapped up the last,"
286,C.M. RUTLEY.,And that tells you my story is done.

298,C.M. RUTLEY.,Frisk was a dear little dog. He belonged to Mistress Molly.
299,C.M. RUTLEY.,
300,C.M. RUTLEY.,"One morning Molly said, “Now Frisk, I am going to the town, and you must"
301,C.M. RUTLEY.,"stay and look after the house, for Mother is going out too.”"
302,C.M. RUTLEY.,
303,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Frisk sat down in his little chair, and held his walking stick between"
304,C.M. RUTLEY.,his paws.
305,C.M. RUTLEY.,
306,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“No one shall steal the dinner while _I_ am here,” he said. “Bow, wow!”"
307,C.M. RUTLEY.,
308,C.M. RUTLEY.,"On her way to the town, Molly saw her cousin Tommy leaning over a gate."
309,C.M. RUTLEY.,
310,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
311,C.M. RUTLEY.,
312,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Oh, Tommy!” she said, “If you are passing our house, please look in and"
313,C.M. RUTLEY.,see how Frisk is getting on.”
314,C.M. RUTLEY.,
315,C.M. RUTLEY.,And Tommy ran off at once.
316,C.M. RUTLEY.,
317,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Frisk _was_ glad to see Tommy, who gave him a good drink of water from a"
318,C.M. RUTLEY.,tub.
319,C.M. RUTLEY.,
320,C.M. RUTLEY.,When Molly reached the town she went into the baker's shop to buy a loaf
321,C.M. RUTLEY.,of bread.
322,C.M. RUTLEY.,
323,C.M. RUTLEY.,But when she put her hand in her pocket she found her purse had gone!
324,C.M. RUTLEY.,
325,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Don't cry, my dear,” said the baker."
326,C.M. RUTLEY.,
327,C.M. RUTLEY.,"And he left his shop, and went with Molly down the road."
328,C.M. RUTLEY.,
329,C.M. RUTLEY.,Very soon they found the purse with all the money quite safe inside.
330,C.M. RUTLEY.,
331,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Then Molly saw a shop with “SALE” printed in the window, and went in."
332,C.M. RUTLEY.,
333,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Good morning, ma'am!” said the shopman. “What can I get for you?”"
334,C.M. RUTLEY.,
335,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“I want some stockings, please,” said Molly."
336,C.M. RUTLEY.,
337,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
338,C.M. RUTLEY.,
339,C.M. RUTLEY.,“How do you like these?” said the shopman. “They are _only_ one shilling
340,C.M. RUTLEY.,"the pair, because it is sale time!”"
341,C.M. RUTLEY.,
342,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“They _are_ lovely!” said Molly, “And the scarlet stripes just match my"
343,C.M. RUTLEY.,"dress! Please make them into a tiny parcel, and I will put them in my"
344,C.M. RUTLEY.,"pocket.” Then she paid her money, and set off home."
345,C.M. RUTLEY.,
346,C.M. RUTLEY.,And what had Frisk been doing all this time?
347,C.M. RUTLEY.,
348,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
349,C.M. RUTLEY.,
350,C.M. RUTLEY.,"He soon grew tired of looking after the dinner, and spied his master's"
351,C.M. RUTLEY.,hat.
352,C.M. RUTLEY.,
353,C.M. RUTLEY.,“Bow wow!” he said. “What fun!”
354,C.M. RUTLEY.,
355,C.M. RUTLEY.,"He poked his head into the hat, and though it came right down on to his"
356,C.M. RUTLEY.,shoulders he didn't mind a bit.
357,C.M. RUTLEY.,
358,C.M. RUTLEY.,"He hopped into the garden on his hind legs, and when the birds saw him"
359,C.M. RUTLEY.,they thought it was a scarecrow come to frighten them away!
360,C.M. RUTLEY.,
361,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Bow wow!” said Frisk. “I'm hungry!” He went back indoors, pushed the"
362,C.M. RUTLEY.,"lid off the pot, and dragged out a bone. How good it was!"
363,C.M. RUTLEY.,
364,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Then a tiny mouse scampered past, and Frisk pounced on it and killed it."
365,C.M. RUTLEY.,
366,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
367,C.M. RUTLEY.,
368,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Oh, Frisk, Frisk!” cried Molly, when she came home. “You _naughty_ dog!"
369,C.M. RUTLEY.,I shall never be able to leave you in charge again!”
370,C.M. RUTLEY.,
371,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Bow, wow!” cried Frisk. “Bow, wow! I'm _very_ glad. For I'd much rather"
372,C.M. RUTLEY.,go to the town with you!”

382,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
383,C.M. RUTLEY.,
384,C.M. RUTLEY.,Jack always said he should be a sailor when he grew up.
385,C.M. RUTLEY.,
386,C.M. RUTLEY.,"No toy ever pleased him so much as a boat, and he was constantly"
387,C.M. RUTLEY.,"imitating the ways of sailors, from dancing a hornpipe, down to floating"
388,C.M. RUTLEY.,about in a big round tub on the little stream which ran at the end of
389,C.M. RUTLEY.,the garden.
390,C.M. RUTLEY.,
391,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
392,C.M. RUTLEY.,
393,C.M. RUTLEY.,"“Wouldn't it be too lovely for words,” he said on one occasion when he"
394,C.M. RUTLEY.,"was taking his sisters for a voyage in his tub-ship, “if we could go in"
395,C.M. RUTLEY.,"a _real_ big boat, and sail away across the sea?”"
396,C.M. RUTLEY.,
397,C.M. RUTLEY.,"And that is exactly what they did do! For one summer day, Father and"
398,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Mother and the children, Elsie, Doris and Jack, all went on board a big"
399,C.M. RUTLEY.,boat and steamed across the channel to France for a long holiday.
400,C.M. RUTLEY.,
401,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
402,C.M. RUTLEY.,
403,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Oh! what a glorious time they had! What fun the bathing was, undressing"
404,C.M. RUTLEY.,"in the little rocky caves and running down the firm sand, and then"
405,C.M. RUTLEY.,tumbling into the water with shouts of joy. Then afterwards they paddled
406,C.M. RUTLEY.,"and dug in the sands, and searched for shells and seaweed, and"
407,C.M. RUTLEY.,thoroughly enjoyed themselves the whole day long.
408,C.M. RUTLEY.,
409,C.M. RUTLEY.,"There was so much to interest them, too, in the little French village,"
410,C.M. RUTLEY.,and they were delighted with the quaint dresses of the peasants.
411,C.M. RUTLEY.,
412,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
413,C.M. RUTLEY.,
414,C.M. RUTLEY.,"One girl came to bring them fruit and vegetables, and the children"
415,C.M. RUTLEY.,"thought how pretty she looked in her snowy cap, coloured skirt and"
416,C.M. RUTLEY.,"wooden shoes, as she lifted her little sister to look for father's boat."
417,C.M. RUTLEY.,
418,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Jack, of course, was just in his glory, and never tired of watching the"
419,C.M. RUTLEY.,fishing boats sailing out to sea.
420,C.M. RUTLEY.,
421,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Sometimes he went on the water himself, and soon learned to row, tho'"
422,C.M. RUTLEY.,"the first time he tried, his oar swung round and knocked him head over"
423,C.M. RUTLEY.,heels into the bottom of the boat.
424,C.M. RUTLEY.,
425,C.M. RUTLEY.,"This, Father explained, was called “catching a crab!”"
426,C.M. RUTLEY.,
427,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
428,C.M. RUTLEY.,
429,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Afterwards they made a huge sandcastle, and Jackie sat at the top of it,"
430,C.M. RUTLEY.,singing: “I'm the King of the Castle!” at the top of his voice.
431,C.M. RUTLEY.,
432,C.M. RUTLEY.,Presently he began to examine some shells and treasures which he had
433,C.M. RUTLEY.,"been collecting in his pail, and was so intent on this, that he did not"
434,C.M. RUTLEY.,notice how quickly the tide had come in.
435,C.M. RUTLEY.,
436,C.M. RUTLEY.,"When he looked up he found, somewhat to his horror, that he was quite"
437,C.M. RUTLEY.,surrounded by water.
438,C.M. RUTLEY.,
439,C.M. RUTLEY.,The castle was soon washed away; but not before the “King” was rescued
440,C.M. RUTLEY.,from his perilous position.
441,C.M. RUTLEY.,
442,C.M. RUTLEY.,"Father waded out, and pick-a-backed him safely ashore."
443,C.M. RUTLEY.,
444,C.M. RUTLEY.,That was the little sailor's first adventure at sea!
445,C.M. RUTLEY.,
446,C.M. RUTLEY.,"The last time for Jackie to sail his boat came all too soon for him, and"
447,C.M. RUTLEY.,the next day the children found themselves back in old England once
448,C.M. RUTLEY.,more.
449,C.M. RUTLEY.,
450,C.M. RUTLEY.,[Illustration]
451,C.M. RUTLEY.,
452,C.M. RUTLEY.,But they hope some day to return for another delightful holiday to the
453,C.M. RUTLEY.,dear little French fishing village where they spent such a pleasant
454,C.M. RUTLEY.,time.

483,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"The basket was so big,"
484,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"That carefully each held a side,"
485,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Until they met a pig.
486,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
487,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“Why, he's escaped from Farmer Brown,”"
488,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Cried Jack, “that's very wrong!”"
489,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"And so they put the basket down,"
490,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,To chase the pig along.
491,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
492,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"And when they'd sent him back again,"
493,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Joan found a pretty flow'r,"
494,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Then off they wandered down a lane,"
495,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,And played for half an hour.
496,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
497,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"On, on they walked, and looked around."
498,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"An orchard was near by,"

501,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
502,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"They scrambled through the fence, alas!"
503,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"T'was very wrong 'tis true,"

506,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
507,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"They rushed away, just like the wind,"
508,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Then Joan exclaimed “Oh, dear,"
509,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"We've left the basket far behind,"
510,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"It will be gone, I fear!”"
511,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
512,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"They hurried back with all their might,"

533,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
534,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"So the five little frogs ran merrily off,"

536,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"When one said, “Brothers, do as you like,"
537,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,But I do not mean to come;

540,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
541,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"So the four little frogs ran off to school,"

543,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,But their naughty brother turned his head
544,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,And went another way;
545,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"But he knew all the time he was doing wrong,"

547,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
548,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"He almost wished he had gone to school,"

550,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"And as she was sailing down the brook,"
551,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Little froggy caught her eye;
552,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"So she swallowed him up with a joyful quack,"
553,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,And that froggy had to die.
554,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
555,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Still many a mother-frog tells the tale

557,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"As she gathers her little ones by her side,"
558,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,And the warning they'll never forget.

578,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
579,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"“Let's go to the pond,” said Dickie. “Nurse isn't here to say 'don't.'”"
580,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
581,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"“Let's,” agreed Daisy. She always agreed with Dickie."
582,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
583,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"“We'll get father's rod and line, and catch some fish,” said Dickie. So"
584,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,when no one was looking they got the things and ran to the water.
585,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
586,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"“You have the rod,” said Dickie, “and I'll have the hook. Don't make a"

594,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
595,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"But before Dickie could catch hold of her, in she went. The water ran"

597,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
598,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"Dickie was dreadfully frightened. He made a grab at her, and she made a"

600,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,as the other. Father's rod had disappeared.

608,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,caught a cold. When Dickie got up he put on his spectacles and brought
609,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,out his watch. He put his fingers on the little thumper in her wrist.
610,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
611,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"“You must stay in bed” he said, “and take Lemon Squash. Lemon is good"

676,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,
677,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,One morning I was having a drink of water when two other little pups

680,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,“Will you come and have a game?” they said.

701,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,everybody what I had done. So Mr. Turkey chased _me_ out of the
702,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"farmyard. In a field I met such a funny man. Two birds sat on his arms,"
703,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"and one said, “Everyone would be quite fond of Sammy if he only left off"
704,THE DOINGS OF DICKIE AND DAISY,"being disagreeable!” I trotted home, and began to try at once. Nobody"

830,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"There are four of us altogether—Kitty, Tabby, Fluffy, and me."
831,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
832,THE KITKIN FAMILY,When we were very little we used to live up in the stable loft with our

834,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
835,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"We did not like learning very much, but I don't believe anyone ever"

837,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
838,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"It was horrid having to wash our faces every morning, and I used to wish"
839,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I was black like Kitty, then I need not have been so particular, but"
840,THE KITKIN FAMILY,Mother said that was all nonsense.
841,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
842,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"When we were clean and tidy, we had breakfast out of the brown saucer;"

846,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"As soon as we were old enough to go out by ourselves, we had fine fun."
847,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
848,THE KITKIN FAMILY,But one day Tabby very nearly got himself into trouble.
849,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
850,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"Tabby, you see, was rather a bold, bad kitten; he was always wanting to"

852,THE KITKIN FAMILY,quarrel with Mike.
853,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
854,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"Mike was the black and white fox terrier, who thought no end of himself;"
855,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"but Tabby did not care a bit what he thought, so he just stood in front"

858,THE KITKIN FAMILY,[Illustration]
859,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
860,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"This was not at all what Mike was accustomed to, and he got stiff all"

862,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"think he would have gone for Tabby, had not Miss Daisy picked him up and"
863,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"carried him off. Tabby never told me, but I believe he was very glad to"

867,THE KITKIN FAMILY,

870,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
871,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I knew Miss Daisy had been given a dear little camera on her birthday,"
872,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"and that she was making pictures with it all day long, so one morning I"
873,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"went and sat on the wooden chair in the hall, just where the sun was"
874,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"shining very brightly. I sat quite still, and then Miss Daisy and her"
875,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"camera came along, as I felt sure they would, and I had my likeness"
876,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"taken, and—here it is."
877,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
878,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"Oh how proud I was of myself after that, and Miss Daisy was so pleased"
879,THE KITKIN FAMILY,with me for sitting so still that she gave me a beautiful blue ribbon to
880,THE KITKIN FAMILY,wear round my neck.
881,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
882,THE KITKIN FAMILY,Alas! that blue ribbon was the cause of great trouble to me.
883,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
884,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I just jumped on the kitchen table to look at myself in the glass, and—I"
885,THE KITKIN FAMILY,upset a bowl of milk that Cook had put ready for a pudding.
886,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
887,THE KITKIN FAMILY,[Illustration]
888,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
889,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I jumped after it, and—oh what a lovely feast I had; but my ribbon got"
890,THE KITKIN FAMILY,all splashed and wet—I was in such a hurry—and that was how Cook found
891,THE KITKIN FAMILY,out it was I who had upset the milk. She would not let me go into the
892,THE KITKIN FAMILY,kitchen for three whole days afterwards.
893,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
894,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I was very dull for those three days. You see, there were mice and all"
895,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"kinds of nice things in the kitchen, and my whiskers were growing fast,"
896,THE KITKIN FAMILY,and that makes you feel that you want mice more than anything else
897,THE KITKIN FAMILY,almost.
898,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
899,THE KITKIN FAMILY,On the third day I went and explored in Cook's bedroom.
900,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
901,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"All kinds of funny things I found in it, and oh! such lovely slippers to"
902,THE KITKIN FAMILY,play with.
903,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
904,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"I took one of these slippers, one with a big bow on the toe. I took it"
905,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"and hid it in the garden, to punish Cook for being so angry with me. It"
906,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"was a very difficult thing for a kitten to do, I can tell you, and I had"
907,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"to rest many times on the way, but I did it, and then I went and sat in"
908,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"the sun and watched, and what do you think I saw? Why, that horrid"
909,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"person, Mike, must have seen all I did, for he went straight to where I"
910,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"had hidden it, and carried it off to Cook. She gives him bones; that is"
911,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"why he chums up to her. Oh, how I should have liked to have—scratched"
912,THE KITKIN FAMILY,him.
913,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
914,THE KITKIN FAMILY,I must not forget to tell you about Tabby and Fluffy and their “night
915,THE KITKIN FAMILY,out.”
916,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
917,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"It was in the summer time, and they had been playing all the evening on"
918,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"the lawn, and then they disappeared."
919,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
920,THE KITKIN FAMILY,[Illustration]
921,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
922,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"They never came in to supper, and they never came in to bed. We never"
923,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"saw a sign of them till the next morning, when they came back looking as"
924,THE KITKIN FAMILY,proud as you please.
925,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
926,THE KITKIN FAMILY,[Illustration]
927,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
928,THE KITKIN FAMILY,Then they told us what they had been doing. They had been having a mouse
929,THE KITKIN FAMILY,hunt in the kitchen.
930,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
931,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"They had hidden under the big armchair in which Cook sits on Sundays,"
932,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"and then, when it was all quite dark and quiet, they had watched the big"
933,THE KITKIN FAMILY,hole by the store cupboard.
934,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
935,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"In a little while, two fat mice had popped out, and then—the hunt began."
936,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
937,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"“We caught them both,” said Fluffy. “We had one each. Oh, what a lovely"
938,THE KITKIN FAMILY,time we had!”
939,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
940,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"Next time they go hunting, I am going, too."
941,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
942,THE KITKIN FAMILY,One day Kitty and I had a most tremendous adventure. We went to the
943,THE KITKIN FAMILY,grand Show up in London.
944,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
945,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"The journey was not a bit nice, but we kept very close to each other,"
946,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"and shut our eyes up tight, and tried to pretend we were not shut up in"
947,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"a hamper, but under Cook's chair, waiting for the mice to come out."
948,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
949,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"When we got to the Show we felt a little strange, but we soon got used"
950,THE KITKIN FAMILY,to the noise and all the people.
951,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
952,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"“We must look our best, Kitty, Miss Daisy said so,” I whispered. “We are"
953,THE KITKIN FAMILY,much handsomer than the other cats here; let us show ourselves off.”
954,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
955,THE KITKIN FAMILY,And we did.
956,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
957,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"Presently a lady came and pinned a big white card, with “First Prize” on"
958,THE KITKIN FAMILY,"it, right in front of us. We showed ourselves off more than ever after"
959,THE KITKIN FAMILY,that.
960,THE KITKIN FAMILY,
961,THE KITKIN FAMILY,This is our picture. Don't you think we deserved the First Prize?
962,THE KITKIN FAMILY,

1336,P. S. BRUFF.,
1337,P. S. BRUFF.,"Mrs. Puss-Cat had a lovely tabby coat, as smooth as velvet, and a"
1338,P. S. BRUFF.,"beautiful fluffy tail. Her eyes were bright and twinkly, and she would"
1339,P. S. BRUFF.,sit in front of the fire for hours and hours thinking of nothing but
1340,P. S. BRUFF.,mischief.
1341,P. S. BRUFF.,
1342,P. S. BRUFF.,"One day Mrs. Gamp was invited out to tea. She put on her very best gown,"

1345,P. S. BRUFF.,When she looked at herself in the glass she felt pleased!

1349,P. S. BRUFF.,"As soon as Mrs. Gamp had gone, Mrs. Puss-Cat gave three loud purrs of"

1351,P. S. BRUFF.,
1352,P. S. BRUFF.,She trotted into the garden and got her feet all covered with mud.
1353,P. S. BRUFF.,
1354,P. S. BRUFF.,[Illustration]
1355,P. S. BRUFF.,
1356,P. S. BRUFF.,"Then she scampered upstairs, and danced a cat dance all over the clean"
1357,P. S. BRUFF.,"white counterpane on Mrs. Gamp's bed. She climbed on the washstand, and"
1358,P. S. BRUFF.,"upset the water jug, then she squeezed into the wardrobe, and pulled"
1359,P. S. BRUFF.,Mrs. Gamp's dresses out on to the floor. And some of them she tore to
1360,P. S. BRUFF.,teeny tiny shreds!
1361,P. S. BRUFF.,
1362,P. S. BRUFF.,When she had finished she darted out of the room.
1363,P. S. BRUFF.,
1364,P. S. BRUFF.,"But alack-a-day! At the top of the stairs she slipped, and"
1365,P. S. BRUFF.,"fell—bumpetty, bumpetty, bump, all the way to the bottom."
1366,P. S. BRUFF.,
1367,P. S. BRUFF.,Presently Mrs. Gamp came home. And the first thing she heard was a
1368,P. S. BRUFF.,strange noise in the kitchen. First a miaou. Then a sob. Then more
1369,P. S. BRUFF.,"miaous. Then—sob, sob, sob! She opened the door, and there, perched upon"
1370,P. S. BRUFF.,a stool in front of the dresser sat Mrs. Puss-Cat.
1371,P. S. BRUFF.,
1372,P. S. BRUFF.,"Her head was swollen very, _very_ big. Round her neck was tied some of"
1373,P. S. BRUFF.,"the ribbon off Mrs. Gamp's best bonnet, and another piece was twisted"
1374,P. S. BRUFF.,round one fat paw. And from her big round eyes great tear-drops were
1375,P. S. BRUFF.,"falling—splash, splash upon the floor."
1376,P. S. BRUFF.,
1377,P. S. BRUFF.,Mrs. Gamp threw up her arms. “Oh! dearie me!” she cried. “What ever is
1378,P. S. BRUFF.,"the matter? Oh! dearie, dearie me!”"
1379,P. S. BRUFF.,
1380,P. S. BRUFF.,"“Miaou, miaou!” sobbed Mrs. Puss-Cat. “Oh! my poor paw! My poor, poor"
1381,P. S. BRUFF.,paw!”
1382,P. S. BRUFF.,
1383,P. S. BRUFF.,Mrs. Gamp's tender heart was touched. She rushed upstairs to fetch some
1384,P. S. BRUFF.,ointment. But when she opened her bedroom door—well! _you_ know what she
1385,P. S. BRUFF.,saw!
1386,P. S. BRUFF.,
1387,P. S. BRUFF.,[Illustration]
1388,P. S. BRUFF.,
1389,P. S. BRUFF.,"Her tender heart grew cold as stone, and oh! she was _so_ angry! She"
1390,P. S. BRUFF.,"raced downstairs, and gave Mrs. Puss-Cat the biggest whipping she had"
1391,P. S. BRUFF.,ever given her before.
1392,P. S. BRUFF.,
1393,P. S. BRUFF.,"Then she took off her best ribbon, and opened the front door wide."
1394,P. S. BRUFF.,
1395,P. S. BRUFF.,"And Mrs. Puss-Cat went slinking out with her tail between her legs, and"
1396,P. S. BRUFF.,a terribly vicious look in her big round eyes.
1397,P. S. BRUFF.,
1398,P. S. BRUFF.,[Illustration]
1399,P. S. BRUFF.,
1400,P. S. BRUFF.,But Mrs. Gamp's heart soon grew tender again.
1401,P. S. BRUFF.,
1402,P. S. BRUFF.,"She opened the front door, and called Mrs. Puss-Cat back. And Mrs."
1403,P. S. BRUFF.,"Puss-Cat came at once, looking very penitent and sad."
1404,P. S. BRUFF.,
1405,P. S. BRUFF.,"Mrs. Gamp gave her some nice hot milk, and put her in a comfy basket in"
1406,P. S. BRUFF.,front of the fire.
1407,P. S. BRUFF.,
1408,P. S. BRUFF.,"Then she sat by her side, and stroked her smooth velvety head."
1409,P. S. BRUFF.,
1410,P. S. BRUFF.,"And slowly all the naughty mischief slipped out of Mrs. Puss-Cat's head,"
1411,P. S. BRUFF.,"and nice, kind thoughts came in."
1412,P. S. BRUFF.,

1615,AUNTIE.,
1616,AUNTIE.,After looking about for some time they decided on a corner close to the

1618,AUNTIE.,
1619,AUNTIE.,"They made a cosy little nest of string and paper, working hard all day,"
1620,AUNTIE.,"hardly resting till late at night. As to food, Mr. Mousey soon found"
1621,AUNTIE.,"where that was to be got. Many were the visits he paid to the larder,"
1622,AUNTIE.,and delicious were the biscuits and cheese that he found there. It
1623,AUNTIE.,"almost seemed as if things were left for them, for the biscuits were in"
1624,AUNTIE.,bags and the cheese uncovered.
1625,AUNTIE.,
1626,AUNTIE.,At last the nest was finished and they lay down to rest.
1627,AUNTIE.,
1628,AUNTIE.,The very next morning six very tiny pinkish-looking things were to be
1629,AUNTIE.,"seen in the nest. They had bright eyes and long tails, and would soon"
1630,AUNTIE.,"grow into brown little animals like their father and mother. Oh, how"
1631,AUNTIE.,"proud the latter were! Mr. Mousey could hardly keep his eyes off them,"
1632,AUNTIE.,and Mrs. Mousey danced round squeaking with delight. “They are
1633,AUNTIE.,"beautiful, my dear,” said Mr. Mousey, “just like you.”"

1639,AUNTIE.,"embraced each other tenderly, and then Mr. Mousey started off to find"
1640,AUNTIE.,food for the little family.
1641,AUNTIE.,
1642,AUNTIE.,"Every day the children grew bigger and stronger, and merry games they"

1645,AUNTIE.,[Illustration]
1646,AUNTIE.,
1647,AUNTIE.,"But, alas! their happiness was not to continue. One sad day a terrible"
1648,AUNTIE.,disappointment awaited Mr. Mousey. He had started off on his usual visit
1649,AUNTIE.,"to the larder. He returned almost at once, saying,"
1650,AUNTIE.,
1651,AUNTIE.,"“My dear, we must move. I heard the Cook say everything was to be put in"
1652,AUNTIE.,"tins, so we shall starve if we stay, and,” with a shudder, “worse still,"
1653,AUNTIE.,"she has got a cat. I fear she will hear the children's voices, and we"
1654,AUNTIE.,shall be caught.”
1655,AUNTIE.,
1656,AUNTIE.,"So gathering their family around them they told the sad news, and"
1657,AUNTIE.,"glancing tearfully at their cosy nest, they crept sadly away."

1704,MARY HAMILTON.,
1705,MARY HAMILTON.,
1706,MARY HAMILTON.,"Jennie and Jackie were twins. They had two dearly-loved playmates, Fifie"
1707,MARY HAMILTON.,"the puppy, and Fipps the kitten. Fifie was nearly always in disgrace."
1708,MARY HAMILTON.,
1709,MARY HAMILTON.,"One day Fifie thought, “Now I will be good to-day. I will sit in the"
1710,MARY HAMILTON.,field and there will be nothing to make me naughty.”
1711,MARY HAMILTON.,
1712,MARY HAMILTON.,But as he passed through the hall he spied Jennie's doll on a chair.
1713,MARY HAMILTON.,
1714,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Ah!” said Fifie, “Betsy Ann enjoys the fresh air. I'll take her with"
1715,MARY HAMILTON.,me.”
1716,MARY HAMILTON.,
1717,MARY HAMILTON.,So he carried her off and carefully laid her on the grass.
1718,MARY HAMILTON.,
1719,MARY HAMILTON.,After a while he grew fidgetty and then he saw that Betsy Ann was
1720,MARY HAMILTON.,staring at him with her great eyes.
1721,MARY HAMILTON.,
1722,MARY HAMILTON.,“Don't stare at me like that!” he barked.
1723,MARY HAMILTON.,
1724,MARY HAMILTON.,But she took no notice and went on staring. This made him so angry that
1725,MARY HAMILTON.,"he bit her foot, and when it came off in his mouth he tore her arm, and"
1726,MARY HAMILTON.,"then rolled her over and shook and worried her, until she was lying"
1727,MARY HAMILTON.,scattered all round him in lots of pieces.

1735,MARY HAMILTON.,
1736,MARY HAMILTON.,"Jennie was terribly upset about it, and when Nurse came, Fifie was"
1737,MARY HAMILTON.,soundly smacked.
1738,MARY HAMILTON.,
1739,MARY HAMILTON.,Not long after there were fearful mi-ows from the pond. Jennie rushed
1740,MARY HAMILTON.,"with her butterfly net, and was just in time to save Fipps from"
1741,MARY HAMILTON.,drowning.
1742,MARY HAMILTON.,
1743,MARY HAMILTON.,He had been trying to catch fish in the pond and had fallen in.
1744,MARY HAMILTON.,
1745,MARY HAMILTON.,So Jennie carried him home and put him in Betsy Ann's bed.
1746,MARY HAMILTON.,
1747,MARY HAMILTON.,Jackie used sometimes to dab a little butter on the tip of Fifie's nose
1748,MARY HAMILTON.,just for the fun of seeing him try to lick it off with his tongue and
1749,MARY HAMILTON.,roll his eyes round and round to try and see it.
1750,MARY HAMILTON.,
1751,MARY HAMILTON.,"When Mother heard of Fifie's naughtiness with Betsy Ann, she said that"
1752,MARY HAMILTON.,Fifie must wear a muzzle for some hours every day until he learnt to
1753,MARY HAMILTON.,behave better. Poor Fifie! how he hated it and longed to join in the
1754,MARY HAMILTON.,romps with Jennie and Fipps.
1755,MARY HAMILTON.,
1756,MARY HAMILTON.,"However he was so good for a week, that Mother said the muzzle might be"
1757,MARY HAMILTON.,left off.

1847,C. E. C. WARNER.,"Gretchen was a goose girl. She lived in a tiny cottage with a red roof,"
1848,C. E. C. WARNER.,"all amidst the fields, and woods, and hills, and every day she took a"
1849,C. E. C. WARNER.,big stick and drove her geese across the common to the pond on the other
1850,C. E. C. WARNER.,side.
1851,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1852,C. E. C. WARNER.,"One summer morning her mother said she might take a holiday, and go and"
1853,C. E. C. WARNER.,visit her Auntie Jeanne. So Gretchen dressed herself in her best
1854,C. E. C. WARNER.,"clothes, and set out to the village. She spent a happy time with her"
1855,C. E. C. WARNER.,"auntie, and after tea started for home."
1856,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1857,C. E. C. WARNER.,Just on the edge of the common she met her geese.
1858,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1859,C. E. C. WARNER.,"When they saw her they began to cackle in great excitement, and caught"
1860,C. E. C. WARNER.,hold of her skirts. Gretchen drove them off with her umbrella. But they
1861,C. E. C. WARNER.,"only waddled on a little way, then looked back to see what she was"
1862,C. E. C. WARNER.,doing.
1863,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1864,C. E. C. WARNER.,“I believe they want me to follow them!” cried Gretchen.

1868,C. E. C. WARNER.,"As soon as the geese saw her coming they began to run, and Gretchen ran"
1869,C. E. C. WARNER.,"after. On and on they went, over the common, across the fields, until"
1870,C. E. C. WARNER.,"they came to a little shady dell in a wood. And here Gretchen stopped,"
1871,C. E. C. WARNER.,"and clapped her hands with delight, for on the mossy ground was spread"
1872,C. E. C. WARNER.,the most delicious tea she had ever seen. All around sat a number of
1873,C. E. C. WARNER.,little brown rabbits. Peter Bunny spied Gretchen first.
1874,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1875,C. E. C. WARNER.,[Illustration]
1876,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1877,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“Look, mother!” he cried. “There's a little servant girl!”"
1878,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1879,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“So there is!” exclaimed Mrs. Bunny, staring at Gretchen. “What wages do"
1880,C. E. C. WARNER.,"you ask, my dear?”"
1881,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1882,C. E. C. WARNER.,[Illustration]
1883,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1884,C. E. C. WARNER.,"Gretchen thought this great fun. “If you please,” she said, “I should be"
1885,C. E. C. WARNER.,quite satisfied with some of those lovely cakes.”
1886,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1887,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“As many as you like,” said Mrs. Bunny. “Now go and fetch the tea.”"
1888,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1889,C. E. C. WARNER.,"The geese had vanished, so Gretchen filled the tea pot from the little"
1890,C. E. C. WARNER.,"kettle on the fire, and Peter Bunny carried dishes of cakes. Then they"
1891,C. E. C. WARNER.,"all sat down, and Gretchen had as many cakes as she could eat. When tea"
1892,C. E. C. WARNER.,"was over, Mrs. Bunny told Gretchen to go and play with the children"
1893,C. E. C. WARNER.,until bedtime.
1894,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1895,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“What's that?” asked Peter, presently, pointing to the umbrella, and"
1896,C. E. C. WARNER.,Gretchen showed him how it opened and shut.
1897,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1898,C. E. C. WARNER.,“I know!” he cried. “We'll go for a sail in the air.”
1899,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1900,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“Hurrah!” cried all the other rabbits, and they dragged Gretchen and the"
1901,C. E. C. WARNER.,umbrella on to the common.
1902,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1903,C. E. C. WARNER.,[Illustration]
1904,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1905,C. E. C. WARNER.,"She opened the umbrella wide, Peter caught hold of her skirts, and the"
1906,C. E. C. WARNER.,"other rabbits joined on behind, holding on to each other's tails. “One,"
1907,C. E. C. WARNER.,"two, three—go!” cried Peter, and the whole party went soaring into the"
1908,C. E. C. WARNER.,"air. It was a delicious feeling. Higher and higher they went, until at"
1909,C. E. C. WARNER.,last they were right above the clouds.
1910,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1911,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“Oh!” cried Gretchen, suddenly, “the umbrella's shutting up! Oh!"
1912,C. E. C. WARNER.,whatever shall we do?” Sure enough the umbrella was no longer puffed out
1913,C. E. C. WARNER.,"like a balloon, but hanging loosely round the handle, and the next"
1914,C. E. C. WARNER.,moment it began to fall.
1915,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1916,C. E. C. WARNER.,“We're tumbling into the sea!” cried the rabbit at the bottom of the
1917,C. E. C. WARNER.,"chain, and there was a loud splash."
1918,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1919,C. E. C. WARNER.,[Illustration]
1920,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1921,C. E. C. WARNER.,"Splash, splash, splash! One by one all the bunnies fell in until only"
1922,C. E. C. WARNER.,Peter and Gretchen were left. All of a sudden the umbrella flew out of
1923,C. E. C. WARNER.,"her hands, and she awoke to find herself sitting by the side of the"
1924,C. E. C. WARNER.,"pond, while her geese were splashing in for their evening swim. On the"
1925,C. E. C. WARNER.,"ground in front of her lay the umbrella, but Peter and the rest of the"
1926,C. E. C. WARNER.,rabbits had completely disappeared.
1927,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1928,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“I hope they're not drowned,” she said, as she got up and peered into"
1929,C. E. C. WARNER.,"the pond. But the water was so clear she could look right to the bottom,"
1930,C. E. C. WARNER.,and no sign of a bunny rabbit could she see.
1931,C. E. C. WARNER.,
1932,C. E. C. WARNER.,"“It must have been a dream,” she said, as she smoothed out her dress."
1933,C. E. C. WARNER.,“But those cakes were lovely. So was the journey through the air.” She
1934,C. E. C. WARNER.,"picked up her umbrella and opened it, but it wouldn't lift her an inch"
1935,C. E. C. WARNER.,off the ground. So she scampered home to find mother standing in the
1936,C. E. C. WARNER.,"doorway looking for her, but when she told her story, mother laughed."

2080,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2081,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2082,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"My name is Tim, and I am only a rough-haired terrier dog, so you must"
2083,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"not mind if I make mistakes in this story, because it is the first time"
2084,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"I have ever told a real, story book one."
2085,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2086,BABY'S BUNNIE.,I thought perhaps you would like to hear about some of the people I met
2087,BABY'S BUNNIE.,the first time I went on a visit with my master.
2088,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2089,BABY'S BUNNIE.,We went to stay at a big house in the country. There were no other
2090,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"houses round it, only lots and lots of trees, and they kept the houses"
2091,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"away, I expect."
2092,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2093,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"When we first arrived, I kept pretty quiet The train had made me feel"
2094,BABY'S BUNNIE.,rather queer in my legs. I wasn't frightened; none of our family are
2095,BABY'S BUNNIE.,ever frightened of anything—certainly not of a silly old train that
2096,BABY'S BUNNIE.,doesn't even know how to growl properly.
2097,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2098,BABY'S BUNNIE.,[Illustration]
2099,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2100,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"Well, after I began to get used to things, I went out into the garden to"
2101,BABY'S BUNNIE.,see if I could find someone to play with. It was rather dull without Jo.
2102,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"He is my brother, but he isn't old enough to go visiting like I do."
2103,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2104,BABY'S BUNNIE.,At first there did not seem to be anyone about at all. Then I saw an old
2105,BABY'S BUNNIE.,wooden tub.
2106,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2107,BABY'S BUNNIE.,I went and had a look at that. I have found some funny things in tubs
2108,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"before now—sticks and boats, bits of cork that give you a pain inside if"
2109,BABY'S BUNNIE.,you eat them—but never have I seen such a funny thing as there was in
2110,BABY'S BUNNIE.,this tub.
2111,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2112,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"It was very small, with shiny black hair, a shiny red face, and it was"
2113,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"swimming about just like a fish. It smiled at me all the time, too. I"
2114,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"didn't like that a bit, so I barked as loud as I could; but it made no"
2115,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"difference. I could not make it out, and I got very angry, so I walked"
2116,BABY'S BUNNIE.,off with my tail in the air.
2117,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2118,BABY'S BUNNIE.,In a sunny corner I found the Duke and Duchess. They were very rude to
2119,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"me indeed. In fact, the Duchess spat at me, just like the common Tabby"
2120,BABY'S BUNNIE.,family do at home.
2121,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2122,BABY'S BUNNIE.,[Illustration]
2123,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2124,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"I very soon left them, and then I found Laddie, the fine old Scotch"
2125,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"collie, but he wasn't much fun; he is nearly deaf, and he was very busy"
2126,BABY'S BUNNIE.,staring at some white woolly lambs on green stands. Laddie loves those
2127,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"lambs; he once ate one when he was young. He told me so himself, and—it"
2128,BABY'S BUNNIE.,was much worse than eating cork.
2129,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2130,BABY'S BUNNIE.,[Illustration]
2131,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2132,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"Then I heard a great deal of barking, growling and snarling."
2133,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2134,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"I knew it must be Bob, the bull dog. I had been longing to fight him"
2135,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"ever since I came. I ran to the field as fast as I could, my heart"
2136,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"beating very hard, for Bob had boasted to me of all the fights he had"
2137,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"won, and I was thirsting to beat him."
2138,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2139,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"Then I saw him, tearing down the field, his tail tucked in between his"
2140,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"legs, his ears laid flat. He was running away from the old red bull. He"
2141,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"had made faces at him, and then ran away when the bull pretended to"
2142,BABY'S BUNNIE.,chase him. I wasn't going to fight him after that. _I_ wouldn't run away
2143,BABY'S BUNNIE.,from an old bull.
2144,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2145,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"Bob ran into the kitchen, and pretended to be asleep when I spoke to"
2146,BABY'S BUNNIE.,him.
2147,BABY'S BUNNIE.,
2148,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"I went back to the tub after that, and I just went straight up to the"
2149,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"funny, smiling thing, and—I kissed it. After that, we were great"
2150,BABY'S BUNNIE.,"friends, and had lovely games every day till I went away. I wonder if"
2151,BABY'S BUNNIE.,Bob ever plays with it. I will fight him if he does.

2272,C. M. HAMMIL.,"It was Margery's and Trixy's birthday; they were exactly the same age,"
2273,C. M. HAMMIL.,"so they had only one birthday between them, but they had always gone"
2274,C. M. HAMMIL.,"shares in everything as long as they could remember, so they were quite"
2275,C. M. HAMMIL.,happy in sharing their birthday. And what a splendid birthday this one
2276,C. M. HAMMIL.,"had been! First of all, they had been allowed to choose their birthday"
2277,C. M. HAMMIL.,"treat, which was to go to Woodcote Farm."
2278,C. M. HAMMIL.,
2279,C. M. HAMMIL.,"They had driven to the farm in the morning, sitting on the box-seat of"
2280,C. M. HAMMIL.,"the waggonette by John, and as soon as they arrived they had gone all"
2281,C. M. HAMMIL.,"round the farmyard, and looked at the dear little ducks and chickens,"
2282,C. M. HAMMIL.,and every other living creature on the place. They had well shaken the
2283,C. M. HAMMIL.,apple tree and filled their pockets with lovely rosy apples. After
2284,C. M. HAMMIL.,dinner they had gone out into the big field to have a game with old
2285,C. M. HAMMIL.,Dobbin. Dobbin seemed to understand that the children wished to catch
2286,C. M. HAMMIL.,"him by his long tail, and would stand still until they nearly touched"
2287,C. M. HAMMIL.,"him, and then with a toss of his head would gallop off to the other side"
2288,C. M. HAMMIL.,"of the field, followed by the children, until at last, quite out of"
2289,C. M. HAMMIL.,"breath, they had flung themselves down under the willow by the side of"
2290,C. M. HAMMIL.,the little stream.
2291,C. M. HAMMIL.,
2292,C. M. HAMMIL.,"The afternoon was warm, and Trixy was surely getting a little sleepy,"
2293,C. M. HAMMIL.,"when Margery suddenly jumped up. “Come, Trix,” she said, “I hear the"
2294,C. M. HAMMIL.,waggonette;” and off they ran as fast as they could.

2314,MARY HAMILTON.,
2315,MARY HAMILTON.,"It's put on so tight and is so very strong,"
2316,MARY HAMILTON.,"Why if I tear and bite it the whole day long,"
2317,MARY HAMILTON.,"It would not come off, oh dear me no,"
2318,MARY HAMILTON.,My spirits are sinking each day more low.
2319,MARY HAMILTON.,
2320,MARY HAMILTON.,"Then again there are those stupid fluffy things,"

2322,MARY HAMILTON.,"Well, what do you think, they come round and stare,"
2323,MARY HAMILTON.,"And say to each other, “What's that fellow there?”"

2325,MARY HAMILTON.,Yet I'm quite unable to frighten them now

2344,MARY HAMILTON.,am the rest of the army.”
2345,MARY HAMILTON.,
2346,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Very well. Don't be too long at the War, because tea will soon be"

2348,MARY HAMILTON.,
2349,MARY HAMILTON.,[Illustration]
2350,MARY HAMILTON.,
2351,MARY HAMILTON.,“So we will!”
2352,MARY HAMILTON.,
2353,MARY HAMILTON.,And away went the three over the white snow in the bright winter day;
2354,MARY HAMILTON.,"Tom beating the drum till it was a wonder the parchment did not burst,"
2355,MARY HAMILTON.,and Bertie blowing the bugle till he had hardly any breath left. What a
2356,MARY HAMILTON.,splendid noise they all made together! Birds flew out of the hedges and
2357,MARY HAMILTON.,"rabbits scuttled away as the army marched on, feeling very warlike"
2358,MARY HAMILTON.,indeed; and presently met the army's father.
2359,MARY HAMILTON.,
2360,MARY HAMILTON.,[Illustration]
2361,MARY HAMILTON.,
2362,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Please be our General, father,” they begged, “and lead us against the"

2364,MARY HAMILTON.,
2365,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Certainly,” he replied; “but first we will return to camp and storm the"
2366,MARY HAMILTON.,tea-table.”
2367,MARY HAMILTON.,
2368,MARY HAMILTON.,"So home they went in the same fashion, with drum beating and bugle"
2369,MARY HAMILTON.,blowing.
2370,MARY HAMILTON.,
2371,MARY HAMILTON.,"After tea, the younger children also volunteered for the Front, and"
2372,MARY HAMILTON.,"Uncle Bob was little Dick's horse, for of course cavalry was needed. How"
2373,MARY HAMILTON.,"Uncle Bob pranced and galloped! The trumpeter nearly fell off his back,"
2374,MARY HAMILTON.,but went on blowing the trumpet all the same. Uncle Bob told him to blow
2375,MARY HAMILTON.,"it well away from the horse's ears, so Dick sat backwards. As for Baby,"
2376,MARY HAMILTON.,"big brother Gerald put him on the rocking-horse, to be a rough-rider."
2377,MARY HAMILTON.,
2378,MARY HAMILTON.,"“The great thing is to learn to stick on,” said Gerald, “because you"
2379,MARY HAMILTON.,"will find falling off is very easy. Hold the horse's nose, Nellie; it"
2380,MARY HAMILTON.,seems rather a wild one.”
2381,MARY HAMILTON.,
2382,MARY HAMILTON.,"At last everybody joined the army, except the cat. She sat on a chair"
2383,MARY HAMILTON.,"and turned up her whiskers; for cats like peace and quietness, and there"

2399,MARY HAMILTON.,"But Tommy was naughty, “I won't go,” he said."
2400,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Well, choose,” said his mother, “between that and bed;"
2401,MARY HAMILTON.,"You either shall go off to school as I say,"
2402,MARY HAMILTON.,Or go straight to bed for the rest of the day!”
2403,MARY HAMILTON.,
2404,MARY HAMILTON.,"At this Tommy's cousin looked in at the door,"
2405,MARY HAMILTON.,And gave a loud mew of surprise when he saw
2406,MARY HAMILTON.,"The kitten was crying:—“Why, what's that I see?"
2407,MARY HAMILTON.,"Come, Tommy,” he said, “come to school then with me.”"
2408,MARY HAMILTON.,
2409,MARY HAMILTON.,"He took Tommy's paw, and old Tabby Cat said,"
2410,MARY HAMILTON.,"As she stood at the door with a cap on her head,"
2411,MARY HAMILTON.,"“Now, Tommy, remember! if good you will be,"
2412,MARY HAMILTON.,I'll catch you a mouse or a rat for your tea.”
2413,MARY HAMILTON.,
2414,MARY HAMILTON.,"So Tommy was dragged by the paw up the lane,"
2415,MARY HAMILTON.,Nor stopped he his mewing at all till they came
2416,MARY HAMILTON.,"To where old Dame Smut kept a school for those cats,"
2417,MARY HAMILTON.,Who learnt something more than the killing of rats.
2418,MARY HAMILTON.,
2419,MARY HAMILTON.,"The kitten ceased mewing, and gazed on the rows"
2420,MARY HAMILTON.,"Of good little cats, and he murmured, “Who knows"
2421,MARY HAMILTON.,"That p'raps after all I shall like school as well,"
2422,MARY HAMILTON.,And quite enjoy learning to write and to spell!”
2423,MARY HAMILTON.,
2424,MARY HAMILTON.,"When lessons were over, Dame Smut said, “I see"
2425,MARY HAMILTON.,That Tommy a very good kitten can be.”
2426,MARY HAMILTON.,And Tommy in triumph laughed gaily the while
2427,MARY HAMILTON.,He ate up the mouse for his tea with a smile.

2446,EDITH GRABHAM.,Then he looked all round him. He was wondering what could have happened
2447,EDITH GRABHAM.,to all his friends.
2448,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2449,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“This is very funny,” he said to himself. “I wonder where they can all"
2450,EDITH GRABHAM.,"be; they can't have gone to a party and left me behind. Besides, they"
2451,EDITH GRABHAM.,"have not had time to put on their best clothes, for I have only been"
2452,EDITH GRABHAM.,having forty winks.”
2453,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2454,EDITH GRABHAM.,"That was what he thought, but he had really been asleep for a long time,"
2455,EDITH GRABHAM.,and a great many things had happened which he knew nothing about.
2456,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2457,EDITH GRABHAM.,"Presently, Dobbin, the big wooden horse, came walking slowly by."
2458,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2459,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“Hullo,” cried Mister Jack-in-the-box, “How are you, my fine friend?”"
2460,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2461,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“I am looking for a hairy skin,” said Dobbin, sadly. “Every horse is"
2462,EDITH GRABHAM.,wearing one now; the fashion has changed since you went to sleep.”
2463,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2464,EDITH GRABHAM.,[Illustration]
2465,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2466,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“But I have only been having forty winks,” cried Mister Jack-in-the-box."
2467,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2468,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“Forty hundred,” corrected Dobbin. “Here comes Mister Zebra, he will"
2469,EDITH GRABHAM.,tell you I am right in what I say.”
2470,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2471,EDITH GRABHAM.,And Mister Zebra did.
2472,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2473,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“I don't know what will happen next,” he said, tearfully. “I am told"
2474,EDITH GRABHAM.,that Teddy Bears are always asked for now that no one cares for zebras.
2475,EDITH GRABHAM.,"I do think it is a little hard. I know Teddy Bears are hairy, but not"
2476,EDITH GRABHAM.,one of them has a striped coat like mine.”
2477,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2478,EDITH GRABHAM.,[Illustration]
2479,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2480,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“Look at my legs,” said Dobbin. “No hairy horse ever had legs like"
2481,EDITH GRABHAM.,mine.”
2482,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2483,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“I passed a whole new family on my way here,” sighed the Zebra. “There"
2484,EDITH GRABHAM.,"was an elephant that walked without wheels, a boat with sails, a doll"
2485,EDITH GRABHAM.,"with a voice, crackers with toys inside them, a Father Christmas with a"
2486,EDITH GRABHAM.,"real beard, and——”"
2487,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2488,EDITH GRABHAM.,“A hairy horse!” cried Dobbin.
2489,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2490,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“A hairy horse,” answered Mr. Zebra."
2491,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2492,EDITH GRABHAM.,"“Cheer up, cheer up, you boys,” chuckled Mister Jack-in-the-box. “There"
2493,EDITH GRABHAM.,is plenty of room for us all in the world. Suppose we make a family all
2494,EDITH GRABHAM.,"to ourselves, just we three old friends.”"
2495,EDITH GRABHAM.,
2496,EDITH GRABHAM.,And that is what they did.

2580,FIR TREE FARM.,
2581,FIR TREE FARM.,
2582,FIR TREE FARM.,"Fir Tree Farm was the name of the big stone house, so the Squirrels"
2583,FIR TREE FARM.,"thought they could not do better than call their house Fir Tree House,"
2584,FIR TREE FARM.,which they did.
2585,FIR TREE FARM.,
2586,FIR TREE FARM.,"There were three of them, Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel and Miss Brighteyes,"
2587,FIR TREE FARM.,their daughter.
2588,FIR TREE FARM.,
2589,FIR TREE FARM.,Every morning at one o'clock they had lunch on the big branch that was
2590,FIR TREE FARM.,"very high up, because, you see, they knew very well that James and John"
2591,FIR TREE FARM.,"were about, and James and John thought it fine fun to chase them. James"
2592,FIR TREE FARM.,"and John were a terrible pair of pickles, very different to Joseph, the"
2593,FIR TREE FARM.,"black poodle, but then he was a Frenchman, and he could not bear the"
2594,FIR TREE FARM.,"ways of James and John, whom he looked upon as common terriers."
2595,FIR TREE FARM.,
2596,FIR TREE FARM.,"They used to bark at him, and make dreadful fun of him when he went out"
2597,FIR TREE FARM.,"shopping with his mistress, carrying the basket for her."
2598,FIR TREE FARM.,
2599,FIR TREE FARM.,"James and John longed to make him fight them, but he never did, because"
2600,FIR TREE FARM.,"nothing would make him put down the basket, and no dog can fight with a"
2601,FIR TREE FARM.,basket in his mouth.
2602,FIR TREE FARM.,
2603,FIR TREE FARM.,[Illustration]
2604,FIR TREE FARM.,
2605,FIR TREE FARM.,Little Miss Brighteyes rather liked the look of the pickles; she thought
2606,FIR TREE FARM.,"James was lovely, with his black and white coat, but she never ventured"
2607,FIR TREE FARM.,to go down and speak to them—she was not brave enough for that—but once
2608,FIR TREE FARM.,"or twice she threw nuts down on the top of them, and this made them very"
2609,FIR TREE FARM.,"angry, because they were not at all accustomed to be the ones who were"
2610,FIR TREE FARM.,teased.
2611,FIR TREE FARM.,
2612,FIR TREE FARM.,"They used to get into trouble sometimes, and many a good thrashing the"
2613,FIR TREE FARM.,"farmer gave them, especially on the day when they snapped at the"
2614,FIR TREE FARM.,"beautiful frills Joseph wore on his legs, and made him drop a basket of"
2615,FIR TREE FARM.,"fresh eggs. They were rather sorry for themselves that day, and Joseph"
2616,FIR TREE FARM.,was so pleased that he did not know what to do with himself.
2617,FIR TREE FARM.,
2618,FIR TREE FARM.,"Poor old Jane, the brown cow, found them a terrible worry."
2619,FIR TREE FARM.,
2620,FIR TREE FARM.,[Illustration]
2621,FIR TREE FARM.,
2622,FIR TREE FARM.,"They used to hide in the big wheelbarrow, where her dinner was put, when"
2623,FIR TREE FARM.,"the grass was poor, and jump up and frighten her when she came to eat"
2624,FIR TREE FARM.,"it, and they didn't mind a bit when she snorted at them—they rather"
2625,FIR TREE FARM.,enjoyed it.

2630,FIR TREE FARM.,
2631,FIR TREE FARM.,"But one day Jerry, the old horse, who lived in the paddock with Jane,"
2632,FIR TREE FARM.,spoke to them very gravely about it.
2633,FIR TREE FARM.,
2634,FIR TREE FARM.,Now James and John had a great respect for Jerry; they thought he was
2635,FIR TREE FARM.,"quite the wisest person they had ever met, and when he explained to them"
2636,FIR TREE FARM.,"how very rude it was to sit in Jane's dinner place, they promised not to"
2637,FIR TREE FARM.,do it again.
2638,FIR TREE FARM.,
2639,FIR TREE FARM.,"One day the farmer's daughter came to Fir Tree Farm, and when she went"
2640,FIR TREE FARM.,away she took James with her.
2641,FIR TREE FARM.,
2642,FIR TREE FARM.,"John was very sad at first, and Miss Brighteyes felt dreadfully sorry"
2643,FIR TREE FARM.,"for him; even Joseph tried to be nice to him, but it was Jerry who"
2644,FIR TREE FARM.,"comforted him best, and gave him good advice."
2645,FIR TREE FARM.,
2646,FIR TREE FARM.,"Then he set to work to be useful, and behaved himself so well that the"
2647,FIR TREE FARM.,farmer used to send him to bring the horses in from the fields.

2742,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,
2743,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,After the day of reckoning Mr. Northcote went abroad. There success

2749,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"One day he hailed a hansom, and before stepping into it was giving the"

2751,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,strange whinnying sound.
2752,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,
2753,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"“What's the matter with yer?” cried the cabman, giving the animal a"

2756,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"“Don't beat him! He's all right!” said Mr. Northcote, coming to the"

2759,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"Again came the strange whinny, and the deep velvety eyes looked into Mr."

2769,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"“To think you should have come down to this, Firefly,” he murmured, with"

2772,NORA PITT-TAYLOR.,"The poor horse had changed masters several times, and had had a hard"

2831,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,stopped and all the dolls got down. He found himself then hustled into a
2832,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"tiny train, the engine of which whistled loudly, and had a piece of"
2833,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,cotton wool coming out of its funnel for smoke.
2834,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2835,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“Here is the Zoo,” said the doll; “and there are the animals going to"
2836,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,bed.”
2837,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2838,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Charlie looked. Why, the Zoo was his Noah's ark, and the animals"
2839,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,belonged to it! “_This_ isn't the Zoo!” said Charlie.
2840,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2841,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,At this point up came a very grandly dressed gentleman doll with an
2842,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,eye-glass.
2843,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2844,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“This gentleman would like a game of nine-pins, Lady Arabella,” he said;"
2845,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“pray come this way,” and he led them to a lawn where a set of nine-pins"
2846,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,were.
2847,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2848,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“Those are my nine-pins,” cried Charlie."
2849,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2850,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,“Nonsense!” said the doll. “They belong to this gentleman.”
2851,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2852,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“You are a very rude doll,” observed the possessor of the eye-glass to"
2853,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Charlie. “How dare you say my things are yours!”
2854,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2855,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"“So they are,” shouted Charlie; “and I'm not a doll, and you _are_ one,"
2856,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"and you belong to my sister, and you are made of wax, so there!”"
2857,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2858,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,The gentleman doll grew very angry at this. “How dare you!” he said
2859,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,loudly. “Policeman! hi! Policeman!” and one came hurrying across the
2860,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,street.
2861,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2862,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Charlie laughed; he recognised one of the little wooden policemen in his
2863,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,toy box.
2864,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2865,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,“Hush!” cried the doll; “the soldiers are coming!”
2866,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2867,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"Marching down the street came Charlie's tin soldiers, all with drawn"
2868,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"swords, and most of them on horseback."
2869,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2870,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,[Illustration]
2871,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,
2872,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,Charlie boldly advancing laid his hand on the bridle of the general's
2873,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,"horse. Immediately there was a great clatter of arms, and Charlie would"
2874,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,have been cut to pieces if just then he had not woke up to find himself
2875,CONSTANCE M. LOWE.,on the nursery rug.

2925,A. E. BONSER.,Bobbie was only a little stable lad; the only relation he ever knew was
2926,A. E. BONSER.,"a brother, whose vocation was sweeping crossings. One day, a brougham"
2927,A. E. BONSER.,"ran over him, a crowd collected, he followed them to the hospital, and"
2928,A. E. BONSER.,"was told his brother was dead. The gentleman, whose brougham it was,"
2929,A. E. BONSER.,"came and spoke to him, and then he remembered him taking his hand and"
2930,A. E. BONSER.,"leading him to a big house. He was taken to the kitchen and well fed,"
2931,A. E. BONSER.,"and after staying there a day or two, was sent into the country."
2932,A. E. BONSER.,
2933,A. E. BONSER.,[Illustration]
2934,A. E. BONSER.,
2935,A. E. BONSER.,"Mr. Wake, after questioning the delicate-looking child, felt he could"
2936,A. E. BONSER.,repay him for the loss of his brother by taking care of him.
2937,A. E. BONSER.,
2938,A. E. BONSER.,The first thing to be done was to send him to one of his farms in the
2939,A. E. BONSER.,"country, where kind but rough hands would do more than smoky town."
2940,A. E. BONSER.,
2941,A. E. BONSER.,"The people he lived with grew very fond of him, and treated him in every"
2942,A. E. BONSER.,way as their own.
2943,A. E. BONSER.,
2944,A. E. BONSER.,"He had a terrier dog given to him by one of the farm hands, and this he"
2945,A. E. BONSER.,"took a great interest in. Now Floss was a good rat catcher, and as rats"
2946,A. E. BONSER.,"were most destructive in the barn, Bobbie used to take Floss up there,"
2947,A. E. BONSER.,"by the hour together, and hunt them."
2948,A. E. BONSER.,
2949,A. E. BONSER.,One day he caught fourteen rats and mice and laid them at his little
2950,A. E. BONSER.,master's feet.
2951,A. E. BONSER.,
2952,A. E. BONSER.,"On another occasion, they had been waiting some time for a rat, which"
2953,A. E. BONSER.,"had made quite a home of three sacks of corn in a corner of the barn,"
2954,A. E. BONSER.,"when Floss suddenly darted round and sniffed one corner, and then kept"
2955,A. E. BONSER.,his eyes fixed on something which Bobbie could not see. Floss moved a
2956,A. E. BONSER.,"little on one side, and as the rat made its intended escape, he pounced"
2957,A. E. BONSER.,"upon it. The rat was also very sharp, and bit and scratched poor"
2958,A. E. BONSER.,"Flossie's face; this worried him so much, that he gave it one dreadful"
2959,A. E. BONSER.,"bite, which killed it."
2960,A. E. BONSER.,
2961,A. E. BONSER.,"Bob was very kind to animals, and took Floss to bathe his face, and"
2962,A. E. BONSER.,treated him quite as an invalid till his face was well.

2974,A. E. BONSER.,"The children had been ill with whooping-cough, and as soon as they were"
2975,A. E. BONSER.,"well enough they were told, to their great delight, that they were going"
2976,A. E. BONSER.,to stay at a farmhouse by the sea.
2977,A. E. BONSER.,
2978,A. E. BONSER.,"“Oh! Mother,” cried Gerald, “do let us take Nip with us! I am sure he"
2979,A. E. BONSER.,would be miserable without us.”
2980,A. E. BONSER.,
2981,A. E. BONSER.,"“I thought you would want to take him,” answered Mother, with a smile,"
2982,A. E. BONSER.,“so I arranged with the people at the farm that Nip should go with you!”
2983,A. E. BONSER.,
2984,A. E. BONSER.,"The children were overjoyed at hearing this, and rushed out to tell Nip,"
2985,A. E. BONSER.,whom they found lying in front of his kennel wondering what all the
2986,A. E. BONSER.,excitement was about.
2987,A. E. BONSER.,
2988,A. E. BONSER.,"A chorus of excited voices shouted the good news to him, and he wagged"
2989,A. E. BONSER.,"his little stump of a tail, and barked so loudly that he made almost as"
2990,A. E. BONSER.,much noise as the children.
2991,A. E. BONSER.,
2992,A. E. BONSER.,"A few days later they were settled at the farm, and of course were"
2993,A. E. BONSER.,"charmed with everything, and were never tired of visiting the calves,"
2994,A. E. BONSER.,"the ducks, the chickens, the pigeons, and the little baby pigs."

3000,A. E. BONSER.,"When the children fed the pigeons Nip had to be tied up, to his great"
3001,A. E. BONSER.,"disgust, because the birds were afraid of him and would not peck up the"
3002,A. E. BONSER.,"grain while he was loose. This, perhaps, was why he took a dislike to"
3003,A. E. BONSER.,the pigeons. “Stupid things!” he would growl. “They can do nothing but
3004,A. E. BONSER.,"sit and say 'Coo, coo!' all day!”"
3005,A. E. BONSER.,
3006,A. E. BONSER.,But Nip soon had good cause to change his opinion. One day the farmer
3007,A. E. BONSER.,"was going to market ten miles away, and knowing that he would need to"
3008,A. E. BONSER.,"send a message back immediately, he took one of his carrier-pigeons with"
3009,A. E. BONSER.,"him. Some hours later the pretty white bird flew down into the farmyard,"
3010,A. E. BONSER.,"and, tied to its feathers, the children found a tiny roll of paper"
3011,A. E. BONSER.,containing the farmers message.
3012,A. E. BONSER.,
3013,A. E. BONSER.,"“Not so stupid, after all,” thought Nip, with a sniff, and felt a little"
3014,A. E. BONSER.,ashamed of himself.
