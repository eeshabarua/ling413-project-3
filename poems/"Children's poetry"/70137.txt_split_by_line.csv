30,FATHER PORCUPINE AND THE ORANGES.,One day Father Porcupine was out hunting food. He came to a tree in which

46,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
47,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"There was a “pleasant spot” in Mrs. Hall’s parlor, and every day at just"
48,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"three o’clock in the afternoon, if they had been perfectly good children,"
49,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"little Dick and Fanny Hall could go in and sit in that place an hour, and"
50,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,nobody else could go there at that time. The “pleasant spot” was under
51,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,the green palm tree.
52,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
53,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"If they had behaved well, Dick and Fanny always went to their mother at"
54,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,ten minutes of three to be made as “sweet as roses.” But if they had been
55,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,naughty they never went.
56,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
57,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"What did they do in the “pleasant spot?” They told each other stories,"
58,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,and they themselves made the stories.
59,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
60,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"Fanny’s stories were very short ones, such as this:"
61,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
62,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,“One day a little small new small small baby-girl fly went into
63,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"a rose, an’ her mama was not looking, an’ she los’ her way in"
64,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"the rose’s leaves an’ never comed out, an’ that little girl-fly"
65,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"never saw her mama any more, never, never, never again, Dicky.”"
66,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
67,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"Dicky’s stories were short too, and such as this one:"
68,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
69,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"“Sometimes, when little boys have a toy train, just a tin one,"
70,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"and they are playing with it, it turns into a live train, and"
71,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"the engine puffs out live smoke, and live people travel in it."
72,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"But if their fathers and mothers look, or anybody, it is a tin"
73,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"train. And this is a fairy story, Fanny.”"
74,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
75,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"Or like this one, which Dicky said was a “nadventure:”"
76,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,
77,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"“One time, when three little boys went up the mountain, they"
78,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,set their lunch basket down on the tip-top. In about two
79,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"minutes they heard a noise at their basket, and a chipmunk"
80,THE PLEASANT SPOT.,"stood there, and the chipmunk had one of their cookies in his"

138,THE MOON AND I.,
139,THE MOON AND I.,"I said to the Moon,"

144,THE MOON AND I.,Of one so exceedingly bright.”
145,THE MOON AND I.,
146,THE MOON AND I.,The Moon said to me:
147,THE MOON AND I.,"“Baby Bee, Baby Bee,"
148,THE MOON AND I.,Then _why_ don’t you shut up your eyes
149,THE MOON AND I.,"And sleep as you ought,"
150,THE MOON AND I.,And as you’ve been taught?
151,THE MOON AND I.,What folly to act otherwise!”
152,THE MOON AND I.,
153,THE MOON AND I.,"I said to the Moon,"
154,THE MOON AND I.,With a coo and a croon:
155,THE MOON AND I.,"“Pray how can I sleep when in truth,"
156,THE MOON AND I.,"O, Moon, though I try,"

158,THE MOON AND I.,"O, Moon, I am cutting a tooth!”"

212,“KEECOO CARL.”,"“Bless your heart!” she said, drawing her little friend in, and when he"

476,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Miss Howells has told the story of Posy Pinkham’s cat that dreamed. This
477,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,is a story of two other cats Posy had.
478,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
479,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,The cats were sisters. Their names were Fluff and White-face. Fluff was a
480,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,gentle milk cat. White-face was a fierce mouser. White-face would often
481,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"bite and claw her sister, but Fluff never bit and clawed back."
482,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
483,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"Once, however, Fluff bit and clawed first, and there was a fight, and"
484,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Fluff—but that’s the story.
485,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
486,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Papa Pinkham had caught a gray mouse in the wire cage-trap. It was so
487,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"cunning Posy begged to keep it, and Papa Pinkham left it in the cage-trap"
488,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"and went off to business. Posy fed the mouse with five kernels of corn,"
489,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,and then went to dress her doll Lilybell for breakfast.
490,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
491,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,[Illustration: FLUFF ALSO ADMIRES THE MOUSE.]
492,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
493,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Fluff had been looking on. Now she went close up to the cage and sat
494,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,down.
495,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
496,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"Just then White-face came creeping, creeping up, in the way of"
497,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,mouse-hunting cats.
498,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
499,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"“Hush,” she whispered to Floss; “there’s a mouse; see me catch it!”"

503,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"“No,” whispered Floss, “it’s such a cunning mouse, so soft and smooth,"

505,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
506,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"“I shall, I say!”"

508,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"“No, you mustn’t—besides, it is Posy’s mouse.”"

511,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
512,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,[Illustration: UP THE TREE.]
513,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
514,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Just then the mouse moved so its tail came through the wires. White-face
515,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"sprang, but Floss sprang quicker, not at the tail, but at her fierce"
516,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,sister.
517,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
518,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,White-face was very angry; she bit and clawed terribly; she scratched
519,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,Floss across the face—but Floss fought on.
520,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,
521,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"At last White-face got away, and ran out the door and up a tree. Floss"
522,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,chased her and nipped the tip of her tail as she climbed. Then she ran
523,THE KIND LITTLE CAT.,"back to the house, and told Posy all about it."

884,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
885,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,There was a day in her baby-life that little Mary Ellen always spoke of
886,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,as “my first day.”
887,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
888,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“It was when I was a little crib-baby, a little bye-o-baby, you know,”"
889,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Mary Ellen would say.
890,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
891,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Mary Ellen meant it was the first day she could remember.
892,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
893,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,She remembered it by two things—it was the first time she ever heard her
894,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"pretty mama scream, and the first time she ever got her little hands into"
895,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,the fur of a cat.
896,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
897,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mary Ellen was in her crib, in the pretty baby-room of the big white"
898,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"mansion, called “The House of the Grandmothers.” A pink rosebush was"
899,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"growing in a blue-and-white pot, a yellow canary hung in the window,"
900,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,and the sunshine was streaming in over everything. Mary Ellen was lying
901,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"awake, looking at the pretty window, when all at once something made her"
902,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,turn her eyes.
903,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
904,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"There, on the foot-rail, sat some beautiful, furry, bright-eyed"
905,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"creatures, looking at her, and making the most lovely noise. She smiled"
906,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"at them, saying, “goo-goo-goo.” At that, one of them hopped down on the"
907,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"quilt, then came closer, blinking its green eyes and still making the"
908,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"lovely noise. Mary Ellen’s tiny body gave a quick little spring, and—O,"
909,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,delightful!—her hands grabbed into the soft warm fur of a kitty.
910,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
911,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Then came the scream, and mama with it, both through the open door."
912,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
913,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,“Dick! mercy! come quick! scat! scat!”
914,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
915,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Not only papa came, but the two grandmamas and one of the"

918,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“They were right on the foot-rail of her crib—the three tiger-cats,”"

921,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
922,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Papa Dick smiled. “Awful!” said he. “No doubt, Nan, they came in"
923,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,purposely to eat your baby up!”
924,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
925,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,The grandmothers smiled too. “Nan! as if our cats would hurt Mary Ellen!”
926,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,said the youngest grandmother.
927,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
928,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Well, you can all laugh,” said Mama Nan, “but I think six cats are much"

945,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
946,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,There were two or three other events in her baby days that little Mary
947,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Ellen always wished she could remember.
948,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
949,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,[Illustration: THE BIG CAT-BASKET.]
950,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
951,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,One was her first birthday celebration. It was not like any that any
952,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,other little baby ever had. Little Mary Ellen had a birthday when she was
953,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,six months old!
954,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
955,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"The youngest of the four great-grandmothers, Mrs. Persis, was talking one"
956,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"day with Madam Esther, the next-to-the-oldest great-grandmother. “It is"
957,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"time Nan’s baby had some kind of a celebration,” said she. “Why not let"
958,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,her have a birthday the day she is six months old?”
959,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
960,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,“Who ever heard of such a thing!” Madam Esther gasped.
961,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
962,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Why, _we_ have!” laughed Grandmother Lee, Mary Ellen’s father’s mother."
963,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“All we six here have heard of it, hav’n’t we, just this very minute?”"
964,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
965,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Well, this _is_ an idea,” said Grandmother Camp, Mary Ellen’s mother’s"
966,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"mother. “A birthday at six months old! Still, if we choose, what is to"
967,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,prevent? I’ll ring for Nan.”
968,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
969,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"They were all in Miss Persis’ room, the large southwest corner room,"
970,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"in their rocking-chairs, sitting in the sun. The cats lay in the big"
971,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"cat-basket, basking in the golden warmth."
972,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
973,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"When Mama Nan came in, her mother told her the plan. “Did I ever hear"
974,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,anything so absurd!” cried Mama Nan.
975,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
976,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Papa Dick said, “Why not?” and helped the plan on."
977,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
978,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,So Mary Ellen had the celebration. It was held in Mrs. Persis’ sunny
979,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"sitting-room, and she was taken in in her best embroidered robe and blue"
980,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"ribbons with a pink rose stuck in each bow, and the cats had new blue"
981,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,ribbons with rosebuds tied in—and what do you think was the center-piece
982,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,on the tea-table?
983,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
984,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Why, Mary Ellen herself, on a pink sofa pillow, nestled in among the big"
985,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,lace ruffles!
986,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
987,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"And her birthday presents? Six white sugar-candy doves. And when, one by"
988,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"one, they were held up to her face to see, what do you think Mary Ellen"
989,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,did? At the last dove she put out her little pink tongue on its white
990,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,breast and had her first taste of candy.

1007,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Two other celebrations followed little Mary Ellen’s birthday as fast as
1008,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,possible. Mary Ellen’s mama said the baby’s six grandmothers made her

1010,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1011,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,[Illustration: THE SIX STOCKINGS.]
1012,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1013,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"But Christmas was coming, and certainly a baby’s first Christmas must be"
1014,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,celebrated.
1015,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1016,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Great-grandmother Day, one of Mary Ellen’s father’s grandmothers, said"
1017,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"one day to Mama Nan, “I suppose Mary Ellen has six stockings?”"
1018,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1019,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Why, yes, I suppose so—why do you ask?”"
1020,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1021,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“You may hang them for her Christmas Eve,” said the venerable lady."
1022,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Stockings have never been hung in this house, but Mary Ellen probably"
1023,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,will have to be indulged.”
1024,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1025,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Great-grandmother Day was the oldest of the four great-grandmothers.
1026,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"She was a very dignified old lady, and wore steel-bowed spectacles and"
1027,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"carried a snuff-box in her pocket with a vanilla bean in it, and was"
1028,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,treated with the greatest respect throughout the house.
1029,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1030,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Christmas Eve, six baby socks hung in a row in the nursery, and what do"
1031,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,you think was in them next morning?
1032,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1033,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Six tiny packages, just alike. There were six fifty-dollar bank notes."
1034,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Each was labelled: “_To be kept for Mary Ellen’s wedding-dress._”
1035,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1036,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mary Ellen’s mama looked as if she would cry. Papa Dick said, “I wonder"
1037,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,what these grandmothers will do next!”
1038,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1039,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Mary Ellen’s next celebration was on New-Year’s Day. Nothing would do but
1040,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,that the Baby must make New-Year’s calls. Her mama feared she might take
1041,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"cold from “drafts,” being carried in and out of so many rooms, but Papa"
1042,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Dick said, “O, bundle her up!”"
1043,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1044,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,So New-Year’s morning Mary Ellen was dressed in her long white cashmere
1045,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"cape-cloak and her white velvet hood, and was carried about the house,"
1046,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"up stairs and down, to call on her grandmothers in their own rooms."
1047,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"She was quite equal to the occasion. She said, “Da-da, da-da!” (“Happy"
1048,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"New-Year!”) to each and every one who took her mite of a hand, and came"

1069,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1070,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"It was small and round and flat and smooth. Mary Ellen hardly felt it,"
1071,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,and as the hand of a little baby mostly keeps itself shut very tight it
1072,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"did not drop out, and by and by it grew just the least bit sticky and"
1073,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,staid fast.
1074,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1075,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"To be sure, when Mama Nan was undressing her and putting on her nightgown"
1076,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"she suddenly began to sniff. “I seem to smell peppermint,” she said, and"
1077,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,dipped her nose down among Mary Ellen’s ruffles. Then she lifted her head
1078,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,and sniffed all about in the air in the funniest way. “If she were not
1079,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"mine,” she said, “I should certainly say somebody had been giving this"
1080,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"child peppermint! Come here, Dick! Don’t you smell peppermint? Put your"
1081,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,head down here!”
1082,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1083,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Papa Dick put his nose down in Mary Ellen’s ruffles and sniffed. He said
1084,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"it did seem as if he got a whiff of peppermint, but perhaps babies always"
1085,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,smelt of peppermint.
1086,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1087,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Of course she _hasn’t_ had any,” Mama Nan said at last, and they went"

1089,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"little hand staid shut, and she went to sleep."
1090,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1091,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,[Illustration: HE FLASHED UP THE NIGHT LAMP.]
1092,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1093,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"That night, suddenly, just as the nursery clock began striking twelve,"
1094,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"there was an outcry from the crib, so sharp, so painful, that it brought"
1095,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mama Nan to her feet in the millionth part of a second. Papa Dick, too!"
1096,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"He flashed up the night lamp and then there was a second scream, from"
1097,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mama Nan, and she dropped in a heap by the crib. As for Papa Dick, his"
1098,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"hair stood on end. He dashed at the crib and snatched a small mouse,"
1099,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"a live mouse but ever so little, from Mary Ellen’s fingers that were"
1100,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,clutching it tight. In his horror he flung it into the water-pitcher.
1101,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Then he flung the water, some of it, and the mouse with it, into Mama"
1102,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Nan’s face, for she had fainted; and the mouse leaped from Mama Nan’s wet"
1103,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,cheek and ran for his life.
1104,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1105,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"The next minute both were bending over Mary Ellen. Her big blue eyes,"
1106,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"full of tears, were just shutting to sleep again. A tiny pink peppermint"
1107,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,lay on the crib quilt. Mama Nan pounced on it. “What did I tell you!” she
1108,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,cried.
1109,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1110,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Papa Dick was examining the warm little hand. It was very sticky and
1111,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"sugary. There was a tiny red spot, like a pin-prick, on one side of the"
1112,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"palm. “The mouse was after the candy,” said he, “and she just shut her"
1113,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"fingers on him when he bit—hurrah for our baby, Nan!”"
1114,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1115,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“_Bit!_” screamed Nan, and for a moment she looked as if she might faint"

1119,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1120,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"But dear Old Lady Lois, who truly was as fond of sweets as a child, had"

1212,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"She was sitting on the rug, reaching for her playthings—her rag doll and"

1214,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"nursery to help get them, and finally in her repeated reaching forward,"

1303,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,In the midst of the excitement Old Lady Lois came in. The reason of the

1305,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"crossed the floor, lifted the child, poised her a moment on her feet,"
1306,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"then gently laid her down, face forward; and at that second the parrot"

1309,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1310,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Quite around the nursery she followed after her papa and the brilliant

1351,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,sight. The big white house was in a state of excitement. The grandmothers
1352,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,were downstairs all day. Mrs. Persis was sure she had felt the tooth for
1353,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,a week. All had to touch the bit of sharp pearl. “I believe the little
1354,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"rogue _knows_ she is biting us,” Madam Esther said as Mary Ellen let go"
1355,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,her finger with a gurgle of a laugh. She pointed out a tiny red spot on

1357,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,and Papa Dick said grandmothers were queer beings.
1358,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1359,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"But he and Mama Nan “felt” the tooth, too, when once they were alone with"

1365,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,After Mary Ellen could creep she wouldn’t stay on her rug. She would

1368,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"pounding along like a little dog until she got to a chair, when she would"

1370,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"joyfully, she would step about it as fast as she could go, jumping,"
1371,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"gurgling and crowing, until in her wild glee down she would tumble! And"
1372,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"one day, in climbing up after a tumble, she found the chair could walk"
1373,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"too! Mary Ellen made experiments. A good smart push, and off the chair"

1416,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,was very puffy all over. But she seemed to have an instinct as to what
1417,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,to do next. Or perhaps she had studied it all out on her rug. Learned
1418,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"men are trying to pry into the minds of babies now, but as yet none has"
1419,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"discovered _very_ much as to what a baby thinks of, or whether it thinks"

1492,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1493,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,[Illustration: “MARY ELLEN MUSTN’T TOUCH!”]
1494,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1495,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“No, no,” said Mama Nan. “My little Mary Ellen must grow up able to do"
1496,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,right without being watched. If somebody sits by her and prevents her
1497,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"from everything, how can I ever tell whether she is good or whether she"
1498,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,is bad?”
1499,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1500,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Well,” said Papa Dick, “I hope you wont come to grief a-carrying out"
1501,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,your ideas about your little Mary Ellen.”
1502,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1503,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"The next day after her adventure, Mary Ellen was left alone as usual with"
1504,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"her playthings. Her little nose was black-and-blue, and gave her a look"
1505,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,of not being a specially good child. Once or twice she put her little
1506,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"hand up to her face. “Nosey ache, Dom P’e-do,” she said to the parrot."
1507,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1508,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Great-Grandmother Day’s tall old pier glass stood in the room. On its
1509,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,low marble shelf Mama Nan generally kept a vase filled with flowers. It
1510,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"was a glass vase, and very tall and slender. She had been warned about"
1511,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,leaving this vase in Mary Ellen’s reach. “She will pull it over some
1512,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"day,” said Madam Esther, “and the vase’ll break and she’ll get cut with"
1513,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,the broken glass.”
1514,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1515,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mama Nan said “no, she is to learn not to touch things.” But after the"
1516,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"parrot, the vase of flowers was the first object the baby took notice of."
1517,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Mama Nan would take a flower out and give to her, then set the vase back,"
1518,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"shake her head and say slowly, “Mary Ellen mustn’t touch!”"
1519,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1520,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Mary Ellen is a little human being,” she said, “and knows just as well"
1521,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,as I do that I mean she is not to touch the vase.”
1522,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1523,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Yes,” said Papa Dick, “and because she is a little human being she will"
1524,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,some day investigate that vase for herself.”
1525,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1526,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,[Illustration: MARY ELLEN DIDN’T LIKE WATER.]
1527,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1528,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,And now that day had come. Mary Ellen sat for a time on the rug after her
1529,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"mother went out, holding her rag doll by one leg. Suddenly she dropped"
1530,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,the doll and made vigorously for the mirror. She didn’t hesitate a second
1531,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"after getting there. She reached for the biggest rose of the lot, grabbed"
1532,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"it by its head and pulled. Over came the vase, crash, splash, drench!"
1533,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Mary Ellen gazed at the puddle. She didn’t like water. When it spread
1534,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"out and wet her dress, she struck at it and drew herself away. “Notty"
1535,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,watty!” she said. This amused the parrot and he laughed. “Notty watty!”
1536,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"she cried, looking up at him, and struck at it again. Mary Ellen had"
1537,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"never seen anything struck, but it was a very fierce little blow she"
1538,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,gave the puddle of drenched flowers. Then she set off with her big rose
1539,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"for the open door into the hall, and up the stairs she went, and nearly"
1540,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,twice as quick as on the day before.

1552,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1553,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,Poor little Kit laid down the armful she had fetched to the trunks. “How
1554,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,will I ’muse me?” said she mournfully.
1555,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1556,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,"“O,” said her mother cheerfully, “there is a wonderful seashore plaything"
1557,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,which I shall buy you.”
1558,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1559,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,All the way Kit thought about this “plaything.” It proved to be a little
1560,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,blue wooden pail and a spoon.
1561,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1562,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,"Kit had never seen outdoors sand before. “Nurse,” said she, “Is this sand"

1565,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,[Illustration: KIT AND HER PRECIOUS PAIL.]
1566,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1567,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,The little blue pail was truly a “wonderful plaything.” Kit forgot
1568,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,doll-house and dolls. She was world-building—mountains and caves and
1569,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,rivers and seas; wells and “little homes” for star-fish and sand-crabs;
1570,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,great treasure-vaults for shells and pebbles; gardens of sea-weed.
1571,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,"Other children had sand-pails. Some days they toiled in company, and"
1572,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,built long lines of forts. Other days they built large cities. One boy
1573,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,dug a deep well and called it an “oil well.” He sunk a small tin cup of
1574,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,"kerosene in it and put in rags and set it afire with a match, and the"
1575,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,whole little crowd jumped up and down and shouted. But Kit’s mother and
1576,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,other mothers put it out and said it was wrong.
1577,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,
1578,THE LITTLE SAND PAIL.,On the last day of all Kit filled her pail with “sc’ubbing sand” to carry

1590,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1591,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Not one of the grandmothers heard Mary Ellen on the stairs or on the

1593,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"red slippers, past the door where she had tumbled in the day before, past"
1594,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Madam Esther’s, and turned into the other hall with her rose. This hall"
1595,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"was lighted by a large window, and as Mary Ellen felt the sunshine full"
1596,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,in her face she began to smile and look like herself again. She pattered
1597,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"along faster, smiling and smiling, and just as she came to the last door"
1598,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,was on the point of exploding into a whole fireworks of laughs and crows

1600,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1601,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Gum-um!” she called, but first running into the corner and backing"
1602,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,up close against the wall. Mary Ellen had no notion of falling in when
1603,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,_this_ door opened.
1604,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1605,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"It was at Old Lady Lois’s room that she had stopped, as she her little"

1607,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,great-grandmother did not see the child at first. She looked all about
1608,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"her, as if very much alarmed."
1609,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1610,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Yosy!” Mary Ellen cried out. “Yosy, Gum-um!” She toddled forward and"
1611,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,held up the big wet rose.
1612,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1613,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Old Lady Lois gathered her up in her arms and went in. “Are you up here
1614,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"_again_, child?” she said, reproachfully."
1615,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1616,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Yosy,” said Mary Ellen. “Yosy.”"
1617,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1618,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Yes, pretty rosy,” answered Old Lady Lois."
1619,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1620,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,“Yosy!” persisted Mary Ellen.
1621,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,

1623,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1624,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“You best take the flower, Mrs. Gray,” said Mrs. Camp. The others had"
1625,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,heard the chirping of the little voice and had come in to see what had
1626,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,happened.
1627,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1628,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,“Don’t you see she has brought it on purpose for _you_? I _told_ you she
1629,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,would know us apart. I knew she would know _you_ by your _flower_! She

1632,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1633,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Yosy,” said Mary Ellen, pushing the wet flower up against the gentle"
1634,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,old face. This time Old Lady Lois took the rose and pinned it in her
1635,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,kerchief. She looked very pleased. The child seemed satisfied now. She
1636,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,laid her little yellow head back on the white kerchiefed shoulder and
1637,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,looked around on the others.
1638,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1639,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“I shouldn’t be surprised,” said Mrs. Persis, contemplating her, “if she"

1642,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"“Notty watty,” said Mary Ellen."
1643,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1644,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,Madam Esther had gone down-stairs. She came up now with Mary Ellen’s
1645,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,father and mother. Poor Mama Nan seemed even more terrified and
1646,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,breathless than on the day before. “I _told_ you I should never know

1648,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1649,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Papa Dick laughed at her. “You ought to feel relieved,” said he. “Here"

1652,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1653,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,But Mama Nan was not to be comforted in that way. “What _is_ to be done?”
1654,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,said she. “She will undertake this thing every day.” And here she quite
1655,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,broke down and began to sob in a miserable helpless way.
1656,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1657,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Nobody spoke for a minute. Then Great-Grandmother Day said gently, “Just"

1660,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,

1685,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,natural to a child as getting up-stairs does. And there is more danger
1686,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"about it. Mary Ellen ought to be taught how to do it, and then be"

1689,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,
1690,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"The venerable lady stood her cane up in a corner, took Mary Ellen from"
1691,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Old Lady Lois’s lap, gave her a finger and toddled her along to the"

1693,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"Then she stepped down. “Come,” said she, “let’s go down-y, down-y,"

1712,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"After a long breath or two, Mrs. Day bent down and tried again. But Mary"

1738,THE HOUSE OF THE GRANDMOTHERS.,"In Great-Grandmother Day’s it was to ride the cane cock-horse, like a"
