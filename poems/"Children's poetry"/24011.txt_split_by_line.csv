131,ZODIAC TOWN,"Amos and Ann had a poem to learn,"
132,ZODIAC TOWN,A poem to learn one day;
133,ZODIAC TOWN,"But alas! they sighed, and alack! they cried,"
134,ZODIAC TOWN,'Twere better to go and play.
135,ZODIAC TOWN,Ann was sure 'twas a waste of time
136,ZODIAC TOWN,To bother a child with jingling rhyme.
137,ZODIAC TOWN,"Amos said, ""What's the sense in rhythm--"
138,ZODIAC TOWN,"Feet and lines?"" He had finished with 'em!"
139,ZODIAC TOWN,
140,ZODIAC TOWN,"They peered at the poem with scowly faces,"
141,ZODIAC TOWN,And yawned and stumbled and lost their places.
142,ZODIAC TOWN,"Then--a breeze romped by, and a bluebird sang,"
143,ZODIAC TOWN,And they shut the book with a snap and a bang;
144,ZODIAC TOWN,"Shut the book and were off and away,"
145,ZODIAC TOWN,Away on flying feet;--
146,ZODIAC TOWN,"Never did squirrels move more light,"
147,ZODIAC TOWN,Or rabbits run more fleet!
148,ZODIAC TOWN,
149,ZODIAC TOWN,Over a wall and down a lane
150,ZODIAC TOWN,And through a field they ran;
151,ZODIAC TOWN,"And ""Where shall we go?"" said Amos. ""Oh,"
152,ZODIAC TOWN,"And where shall we stop?"" cried Ann."
153,ZODIAC TOWN,"Then all at once, round the curve of a hill,"
154,ZODIAC TOWN,They pulled up panting and stood stock-still;
155,ZODIAC TOWN,
156,ZODIAC TOWN,"For there, by the edge of a ripplety brook,"
157,ZODIAC TOWN,"In a deep little, steep little place,"
158,ZODIAC TOWN,"Sat a long-legged youth, with a staff and a book"
159,ZODIAC TOWN,"And a quaint, very quizzical face."
160,ZODIAC TOWN,His cap and his trousers were dusty green
161,ZODIAC TOWN,"And his jacket was rusty brown,"
162,ZODIAC TOWN,"And he whittled away on sweet white wood,"
163,ZODIAC TOWN,With shavings showering down.
164,ZODIAC TOWN,"He whittled away 'twixt a laugh and a tune,"
165,ZODIAC TOWN,With fingers as light as thistles.
166,ZODIAC TOWN,
167,ZODIAC TOWN,"""And what are you making?"" asked Amos and Ann."
168,ZODIAC TOWN,
169,ZODIAC TOWN,"He said, ""I am making whistles."""
170,ZODIAC TOWN,"He finished one with a notch and a slit,"
171,ZODIAC TOWN,And threw back his head and blew on it.
172,ZODIAC TOWN,
173,ZODIAC TOWN,"The whistle sang like a bird when he blew,"
174,ZODIAC TOWN,Then he twinkled and put it down.
175,ZODIAC TOWN,"""And where are you going,"" he said, ""you two?"
176,ZODIAC TOWN,"_Are you going to Zodiac Town_?"""
177,ZODIAC TOWN,
178,ZODIAC TOWN,Each of them shook a doubtful head
179,ZODIAC TOWN,(For truly they didn't know).
180,ZODIAC TOWN,
181,ZODIAC TOWN,"""But make us a whistle like yours,"" they said,"
182,ZODIAC TOWN,"""And anywhere we will go!"""
183,ZODIAC TOWN,
184,ZODIAC TOWN,"""I'll make you a whistle apiece,"" quoth he,"
185,ZODIAC TOWN,"""And if you like, you may follow me;"
186,ZODIAC TOWN,"Zodiac Town's in the land of Time,"
187,ZODIAC TOWN,"And I go by the road of Rhyme."""
188,ZODIAC TOWN,
189,ZODIAC TOWN,Ann looked at Amos and Amos at Ann;
190,ZODIAC TOWN,They blinked with sheer surprise;
191,ZODIAC TOWN,"And then they looked at the long-legged man,"
192,ZODIAC TOWN,Who twinkled back with his eyes.
193,ZODIAC TOWN,"They said (and their voices were meek and low),"
194,ZODIAC TOWN,"""We ran away from a rhyme, you know."""
195,ZODIAC TOWN,
196,ZODIAC TOWN,"""You did?"" cried the fellow in green and brown."
197,ZODIAC TOWN,"""Then it's unmistakably plain, oho,"
198,ZODIAC TOWN,"That you're due in Zodiac Town!"""
199,ZODIAC TOWN,
200,ZODIAC TOWN,"He took up his book and shouldered his staff,"
201,ZODIAC TOWN,And turned to Amos and Ann.
202,ZODIAC TOWN,"""Call me J. M.,"" he said with a laugh."
203,ZODIAC TOWN,"""That stands for Journeying Man."
204,ZODIAC TOWN,"I'll make you some whistles along the way,"
205,ZODIAC TOWN,While you are remembering rhymes to say;
206,ZODIAC TOWN,For more than once in the land of Time
207,ZODIAC TOWN,"You will have to speak in rhyme."""
208,ZODIAC TOWN,
209,ZODIAC TOWN,"""Our names,"" said the children, ""are Amos and Ann;"
210,ZODIAC TOWN,"And poetry is rather hard for us,"
211,ZODIAC TOWN,"But we'll do the best we can."""
212,ZODIAC TOWN,
213,ZODIAC TOWN,"Then they went away with the young-faced man,"
214,ZODIAC TOWN,"Joyfully up and down,"
215,ZODIAC TOWN,"Talking in rhyme by hill and lea,"
216,ZODIAC TOWN,"Gayly in rhyme--for that, said he,"
217,ZODIAC TOWN,Was the tongue of Zodiac Town.
218,ZODIAC TOWN,To Zodiac after a while they came--
219,ZODIAC TOWN,"The twistiest, mistiest town,"
220,ZODIAC TOWN,"With odd little collopy, scallopy streets"
221,ZODIAC TOWN,Meandering up and down.
222,ZODIAC TOWN,"The home of the years and the hours was there,"
223,ZODIAC TOWN,"Of the minutes, the months, and the days--"
224,ZODIAC TOWN,"Houses with windows that winked and smiled,"
225,ZODIAC TOWN,And doors with sociable ways;
226,ZODIAC TOWN,And leaves and apples and chestnuts brown
227,ZODIAC TOWN,"Came pattering down, came clattering down,"
228,ZODIAC TOWN,And stairways wound to the top of a hill
229,ZODIAC TOWN,That a person could climb if he had the will--
230,ZODIAC TOWN,"That a person could climb, then start at the top,"
231,ZODIAC TOWN,"And bumpeting down and thumpeting down,"
232,ZODIAC TOWN,Go zip! to the bottom with never a stop.
233,ZODIAC TOWN,
234,ZODIAC TOWN,"""_Whoopee!_"" cried Amos--and off and away,"
235,ZODIAC TOWN,"Quick with a kick, like a clown,"
236,ZODIAC TOWN,"He ran to the top of the highest stair,"
237,ZODIAC TOWN,Ann at his heels--And zip! the pair
238,ZODIAC TOWN,Came bumpeting down and thumpeting down.
239,ZODIAC TOWN,
240,ZODIAC TOWN,"Then, ""Come, you two,"" said the Journeying Man,"
241,ZODIAC TOWN,"""We have twelve calls to pay."
242,ZODIAC TOWN,"We'll visit the months this time, if we can."
243,ZODIAC TOWN,Now listen to me: at every house
244,ZODIAC TOWN,Many clocks will be ticking away:
245,ZODIAC TOWN,Grandfather clocks and cuckoo clocks
246,ZODIAC TOWN,"And moon-faced clocks on shelves,"
247,ZODIAC TOWN,"Clocks with alarms and eight-day clocks,"
248,ZODIAC TOWN,All talking low to themselves;
249,ZODIAC TOWN,"Little gilt clocks and clocks with chimes,"
250,ZODIAC TOWN,And all of them keeping different times.
251,ZODIAC TOWN,And any minute of any hour
252,ZODIAC TOWN,"(You never did see their like),"
253,ZODIAC TOWN,"Evening or morning, with never a warning,"
254,ZODIAC TOWN,One of the lot will strike.
255,ZODIAC TOWN,"And you _may_ be talking your everyday talk,"
256,ZODIAC TOWN,"But the instant the hour shall chime,"
257,ZODIAC TOWN,"Quick as a flash you must stop, and dash"
258,ZODIAC TOWN,"Right into a rollicking rhyme!"""
259,ZODIAC TOWN,
260,ZODIAC TOWN,"""What kind of a rhyme?"" gasped Amos and Ann."
261,ZODIAC TOWN,"""What kind of a rhyme, J. M.?"""
262,ZODIAC TOWN,
263,ZODIAC TOWN,"""Any kind at all,"" said the Journeying Man,"
264,ZODIAC TOWN,As he twinkled his eyes at them.
265,ZODIAC TOWN,"""But it must begin with the very two sounds,"
266,ZODIAC TOWN,"(Or three or four, if you like,)"
267,ZODIAC TOWN,_The last few sounds that were on your tongue_
268,ZODIAC TOWN,"_When the clock began to strike_!"""

284,_JANUARY_,"A house made all of snow,"
285,_JANUARY_,"With windows of ice, and chandeliers"
286,_JANUARY_,Of icicles all in a row.
287,_JANUARY_,The trim young master was dressed in fur
288,_JANUARY_,And didn't seem cold at all--
289,_JANUARY_,"A red-cheeked, rollicking, frolicking chap,"
290,_JANUARY_,"Who offered each caller an ermine wrap,"
291,_JANUARY_,And let them skate in his hall.

293,_JANUARY_,[Illustration: _They went to the January house_]
294,_JANUARY_,
295,_JANUARY_,"While they were skating round the hall, Amos's feet flew from under him"

297,_JANUARY_,
298,_JANUARY_,"""Did you break anything?"" asked the January boy. ""I hope not, indeed,"" he"
299,_JANUARY_,"added earnestly, ""because so many things are broken here."""
300,_JANUARY_,
301,_JANUARY_,"""What kind of things?"" Amos wanted to know."
302,_JANUARY_,
303,_JANUARY_,"""Mainly resolutions,"" answered January with a wry face. And then he"
304,_JANUARY_,"further said: ""So many of _them_ get broken that sometimes I think I'll"
305,_JANUARY_,"move into another house."""
306,_JANUARY_,
307,_JANUARY_,"""But then,"" put in little Ann, ""we shouldn't have any New Year. And oh,"
308,_JANUARY_,"how we'd miss New Year--"""
309,_JANUARY_,
310,_JANUARY_,A square-faced clock on the hall-landing struck one just as Ann said she'd
311,_JANUARY_,miss New Year.
312,_JANUARY_,
313,_JANUARY_,"""Oh!"" said Ann with a gasp. ""Now I've got to say a rhyme beginning--'miss"
314,_JANUARY_,New Year.' What shall I say?
315,_JANUARY_,
316,_JANUARY_,"""Miss New Year, miss New Year--"" Then all at once, to her intense"
317,_JANUARY_,"surprise, she found herself reciting:"
318,_JANUARY_,
319,_JANUARY_,"""Miss New Year dressed herself in white,"
320,_JANUARY_,"With crystal buttons shining,"
321,_JANUARY_,"A spangled scarf, all lacy-light"
322,_JANUARY_,About her shoulders twining;
323,_JANUARY_,"A bunch of pearly mistletoe,"
324,_JANUARY_,"A twig of ruddy holly,"
325,_JANUARY_,"She tucked among her curls, and oh,"
326,_JANUARY_,She was so sweet and jolly!
327,_JANUARY_,
328,_JANUARY_,"""She tapped upon my window-pane"
329,_JANUARY_,"And waked me, bright and early."
330,_JANUARY_,"'Come, come,' she cried, 'the sun's outside,"
331,_JANUARY_,The winds are gay and whirly!
332,_JANUARY_,"'Neath winter frost and summer sky,"
333,_JANUARY_,"In spring or autumn weather,"
334,_JANUARY_,"Come out, dear child, and you and I"
335,_JANUARY_,"Will be good chums together!'"""
336,_JANUARY_,
337,_JANUARY_,J. M. was the next one to get caught. January had just asked the three to
338,_JANUARY_,stay to lunch.
339,_JANUARY_,
340,_JANUARY_,"""Wish we could,"" said the Journeying Man, ""but in spite of all these"
341,_JANUARY_,"clocks there is no time. I can smell your stew cooking, January--, such"
342,_JANUARY_,"stew!"""
343,_JANUARY_,
344,_JANUARY_,"A clock struck eight just as the Journeying Man said ""such stew."" Without"
345,_JANUARY_,hesitation he went on:--
346,_JANUARY_,
347,_JANUARY_,"""'Such stupid days!' said Willie Green"
348,_JANUARY_,With long and doleful face.
349,_JANUARY_,'Suppose to-night the whirling globe
350,_JANUARY_,Should drop us into space:
351,_JANUARY_,"Hooray! I'd ride the moon astride,"
352,_JANUARY_,"And, if a cloud sailed up,"
353,_JANUARY_,"Pretend it was a feather-bed,"
354,_JANUARY_,"And dive right in, kerplup!'"
355,_JANUARY_,
356,_JANUARY_,"""'What if the moon went in eclipse?'"
357,_JANUARY_,Said little Johnny Brown;
358,_JANUARY_,'Or if the clouds turned into rain
359,_JANUARY_,And sent you drizzling down?
360,_JANUARY_,Or if a thunder-bolt went off
361,_JANUARY_,And knocked you rather flat?'
362,_JANUARY_,
363,_JANUARY_,"""'Now that's the truth,' said Willie Green,"
364,_JANUARY_,'I hadn't thought of that!'
365,_JANUARY_,
366,_JANUARY_,"""But, 'Earth's so poky,' still he mused;"
367,_JANUARY_,'It must be finer far
368,_JANUARY_,"To play _I Spy_ across the sky,"
369,_JANUARY_,And skip from star to star.'
370,_JANUARY_,
371,_JANUARY_,"""'Stars fall, sometimes,' quoth Johnny Brown,"
372,_JANUARY_,"'To where, nobody knows.'"
373,_JANUARY_,
374,_JANUARY_,"""'Oh, dearie me!' cried Willie Green,"
375,_JANUARY_,"'I only said _Suppose_!'"""
376,_JANUARY_,
377,_JANUARY_,Amos had a question to ask as the travelers turned to leave the January
378,_JANUARY_,house.
379,_JANUARY_,
380,_JANUARY_,"""Don't you keep any pets?"" he said."
381,_JANUARY_,
382,_JANUARY_,"January grinned. ""It would have to be a cold kind of pet,"" he replied."
383,_JANUARY_,"""And I don't like seals and walruses. The very animal that I want I can't"
384,_JANUARY_,"have: the alligator has always been my favorite."""
385,_JANUARY_,
386,_JANUARY_,"""The alligator?"" echoed Amos and Ann."
387,_JANUARY_,
388,_JANUARY_,"""Yes,"" said January, firmly. ""Always the al--"""
389,_JANUARY_,
390,_JANUARY_,"But a little nickel clock caught him just there, so he remarked instead:--"
391,_JANUARY_,
392,_JANUARY_,"""Always the alphabet to me"
393,_JANUARY_,Is like a happy family.
394,_JANUARY_,"They work in groups, they work in pairs,"
395,_JANUARY_,But each one has his little airs:
396,_JANUARY_,"R runs and romps, and so does S,"
397,_JANUARY_,And Z is full of foolishness;
398,_JANUARY_,"H always smiles, and A is jolly;"
399,_JANUARY_,G's somehow sort of melancholy.
400,_JANUARY_,Q sticks his tongue into his cheek
401,_JANUARY_,And always waits for U to speak;
402,_JANUARY_,D's fat and lazy; so is C;
403,_JANUARY_,And O makes funny mouths at me.
404,_JANUARY_,Among the pleasant alphabet
405,_JANUARY_,"It's hard to pick and choose--and yet,"
406,_JANUARY_,"When all is said, I can't deny"
407,_JANUARY_,"(You'll understand), my choice is I!"""

422,_FEBRUARY_,They went to the February place:
423,_FEBRUARY_,"'Twas fashioned, with curious art,"
424,_FEBRUARY_,"Of colored sugar and paper lace,"
425,_FEBRUARY_,With a front door shaped like a heart.
426,_FEBRUARY_,"A trim little, slim little maid within"
427,_FEBRUARY_,Was rolling out cookies crisp and thin;
428,_FEBRUARY_,"She blew them a kiss through the window wide,"
429,_FEBRUARY_,And bade them step inside.

431,_FEBRUARY_,[Illustration: _They went to the February place_]
432,_FEBRUARY_,
433,_FEBRUARY_,The little valentine girl in the February house was very sociable; but she
434,_FEBRUARY_,"talked so much, and there were so many clocks striking all around, that"
435,_FEBRUARY_,she was always getting side-tracked into a rhyme.
436,_FEBRUARY_,
437,_FEBRUARY_,"For example, she was just about to describe a jolly party she went to one"
438,_FEBRUARY_,"day last year, when a clock struck six, and she was obliged to say,"
439,_FEBRUARY_,instead:--
440,_FEBRUARY_,
441,_FEBRUARY_,"""One day last year, with hems and haws and sidelong steps and"
442,_FEBRUARY_,"nervous caws, the crows came mincing forth to mail gay valentines,"
443,_FEBRUARY_,"you know. The post box was a hollow tree. They did not know,"
444,_FEBRUARY_,"unluckily, that squirrels had gnawed the floor away, and owls moved"
445,_FEBRUARY_,in below.
446,_FEBRUARY_,
447,_FEBRUARY_,"""The crows went flapping off with glee. They said, 'Our woodland"

791,_APRIL_,"Smooth, round kittens, quite calm and fat;"
792,_APRIL_,On every twig hung a little cat.
793,_APRIL_,"And the fairies danced, and the glad wood-folk"

859,_APRIL_,In a silver cap.
860,_APRIL_,
861,_APRIL_,"""As she moves--how funny!"
862,_APRIL_,Yet it's very plain--
863,_APRIL_,Brighter grows her one eye
864,_APRIL_,And shorter grows her train.
865,_APRIL_,
866,_APRIL_,"""Now, what's the answer?"" she cried."
867,_APRIL_,
868,_APRIL_,"""That's easy,"" the Fool said promptly. ""The answer is, of course, a"
869,_APRIL_,"mushroom."""
870,_APRIL_,
871,_APRIL_,Amos laughed loudly at that; but kind little Ann was distressed to think
872,_APRIL_,what a pitifully poor guess her host had made.
873,_APRIL_,
874,_APRIL_,"""Oh, not a mushroom, Mr. Fool,"" she said. ""Don't you see it has something"
875,_APRIL_,"to do with sewing?"""
876,_APRIL_,
877,_APRIL_,"""Then of course it's a mushroom,"" the Fool said calmly. ""Don't I sow"
