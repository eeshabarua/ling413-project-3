370,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"I’ve been in California for more than three long years,"
371,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"But I’m safely home at last, in spite of mother’s fears.”"
372,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
373,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“Yes, Alfred, it has seemed, to dear mamma and me,"
374,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"A long, long time, and we are glad your happy face to see;"
375,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Morning and evening, do you know? when we knelt down to pray,"
376,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Mamma has asked, that God would bless and guard you while away."
377,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
378,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“And God has kindly heard her prayer, and kept you safe and well.”"
379,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"She worked awhile,--at length, she said, “Dear Alfred, please to tell"
380,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Where you have put your Bible? I’ve unpacked the trunk with care,"
381,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And I have laid upon the bed most all the clothes you wear.
382,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
383,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“I’ve looked at every article, and yet I have not seen"
384,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"A Bible or a Testament; brother, what can it mean?"
385,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,I fear that you have been without a Bible all the way;
386,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Is it in California, or have you lost it,--say?”"
387,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
388,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“You little chatter-box, do see the presents I have brought;"
389,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"This for mamma, and that for you; Why! really I had thought"

391,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"How do you like this India fan, I ask you, Minnie Bell?”"
392,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
393,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“O, it is very beautiful! I thank you, Alfred, dear;"
394,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"But yet you have not told me, what most I wish to hear.”"
395,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“Well, Minnie,” said her brother, “if really you must know,"
396,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,When I sailed for California my Bible did not go.
397,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
398,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“I know ’twas wrong to leave it out, for never have I seen"
399,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,A Bible or a Testament in any place I’ve been;
400,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,We did not often think of God when we were digging gold;
401,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"That is the truth; now, Minnie dear, pray don’t begin to scold.”"
402,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
403,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“Forgotten God for three long years! Alfred, can this be true?"

405,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"He took the dear child in his arms, and bursting into tears,"
406,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“My conduct has been wrong,” he said, “how sinful it appears!”"
407,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
408,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Just then his mother entered, with her heart quite full of joy"
409,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"And gratitude to God above, who had kept her darling boy;"
410,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"She had been alone to thank him, and offer up a prayer"
411,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"That God who had preserved her son, would keep him in his care."
412,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
413,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"“Dear mother, will you pray,” said he, “and read in God’s own Word"
414,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"That story of the Prodigal, which I have often heard;"
415,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"For I have wandered far away, but now desire to come"
416,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And love and serve that Being who hath safely brought me home?”
417,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
418,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Her prayer was heard; and Alfred Bell is now a Christian man,"

437,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,Returned to this village a few days ago.
438,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
439,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"I sent them, this morning, a cart-load of wood,"
440,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And fear that they now may be suffering for food;
441,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"We’ll fill up their baskets with bread and with meat,"
442,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And give the dear children a plenty to eat.
443,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
444,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Their mother is proud, and she cannot endure"
445,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,The neighbors should know they are now very poor;
446,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"But since we’ve “a will,” we must find out “a way,”"
447,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,To help this poor widow--we must not delay.
448,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
449,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Her father’s a drunkard, her husband is dead,"
450,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And she is too ill to hold up her head;
451,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"The wretched old man now reels thro’ the street,"
452,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And never provides them a mouthful to eat.
453,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
454,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Ruth ran to the door, and called them both in;"
455,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Their feet were most naked, their garments were thin,"
456,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,Too thin to go out in this cold wintry weather;
457,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,Here Ruth and her sister both whispered together.
458,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
459,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"O, yes, sister Mary, those stockings you’ve knit,"
460,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Just the thing, and so warm! I am sure they will fit;"
461,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"We’ll make up a bundle, and stow it away"
462,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,In the baskets they’ve left in the entry to-day.
463,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
464,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Little Ella and Harry were grateful indeed,"
465,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,That God had provided such friends in their need;
466,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"Their baskets were filled with biscuit and meat,"
467,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And warm shoes and stockings to cover their feet.
468,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,
469,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"The Greenwood’s oft drew from their plentiful store,"
470,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,And quietly sent to the poor widow’s door
471,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,Such things as she needed. Her proud heart was melted;
472,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"She welcomed their visits, and soon was contented"
473,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,To let little Harry and Ella go where
474,MINNIE’S FAITHFULNESS,"They could hear of the Saviour, and his tender care,"

4112,LOST CHILD.,And loudly-beaten drum.
4113,LOST CHILD.,
4114,LOST CHILD.,"A child was lost,--none could be found"

4122,LOST CHILD.,Till morning lit the sky.
4123,LOST CHILD.,

4129,LOST CHILD.,"That morning, when he strayed from home,"

4131,LOST CHILD.,"Along the water’s edge to roam,"

4133,LOST CHILD.,
4134,LOST CHILD.,"And, as he sported free from care"
4135,LOST CHILD.,"The slippery rocks around,"
4136,LOST CHILD.,"The rising tide surprised him there,"
4137,LOST CHILD.,And there the boy was drowned.
4138,LOST CHILD.,
4139,LOST CHILD.,"They bore him home, a mournful sight,"

4340,HAPPY CAT.,
4341,HAPPY CAT.,Tib saw the bonnet of the guest

4361,HAPPY CAT.,A most unusual sound one night
4362,HAPPY CAT.,"Was heard, and Tib thereby"

4374,HAPPY CAT.,No bigger than herself.
4375,HAPPY CAT.,
4376,HAPPY CAT.,"Tib loved the baby from that day,"

4380,HAPPY CAT.,
4381,HAPPY CAT.,"When puss was old, the baby Tom"

4386,HAPPY CAT.,"In nursing the poor, feeble cat,"
