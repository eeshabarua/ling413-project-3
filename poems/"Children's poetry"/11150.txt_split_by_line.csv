30,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"It is an excellent rule, no doubt, children, not to be in a hurry; and"
31,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"the proverbs, ""Take time by the forelock"" and ""The more haste the"
32,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"worse speed,"" are wise proverbs, worth keeping. But occasions occur,"
33,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"once in a while, when working hastily is a great deal better than not"
34,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"working at all, and may be working to some purpose too. I remember a"
35,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"case of this kind. In a certain town, on the forenoon of July 3, 183-,"
36,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"when ""Floral Processions"" were novel affairs, a company of ladies and"
37,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"gentlemen were assembled in a barn-chamber, finishing off and packing"
38,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"up a lot of moss baskets, and arranging bunches of flowers to be sent"
39,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"to Boston, to the Warren-street Chapel, by the mail coach at 3"
40,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"o'clock, P.M. It was about 10 o'clock when one of the party,--suppose"
41,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"we call him, for convenience just now, Mr. Perseverance,--who had been"
42,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"looking out of the window, down upon a very little garden, suddenly"
43,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"turned round, and exclaimed that something might be made prettier than"
44,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"any thing they had yet done. He told what it was. ""It is impossible to"
45,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"do it now. We must wait till next year,"" said his friends. ""Nothing"
46,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,like trying: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. No time like
47,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"the present,"" replied Mr. Perseverance, a pertinacious gentleman, who"
48,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"wanted to ""strike when the iron was hot,"" and carry out his notion"
49,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"without delay. Accordingly, he caught up two sticks, and nailed them"
50,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"together, so as to get the right shape. Then he went down town,--the"
51,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"town being small, he had not far to go,--begged at the bookstore a few"
52,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"""show-bills,"" containing the letters he needed for patterns; bought a"
53,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"sheet of gold paper and half an ounce of gum-arabic, twice as much of"
54,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,both as he really wanted; people in a hurry are not apt to calculate
55,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"very nicely, or be very economical, you know. He carried his articles"
56,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"back to the barn, and asked a lady to try to cut out a motto he had"
57,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"selected, and gum it on a ribbon. ""But where shall I get the ribbon?"""
58,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"said the lady. ""Oh! find it somewhere,"" said Mr. Perseverance; ""and be"
59,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"sure and have all ready when I return."" There was one spot in the"
60,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,woods he remembered visiting months before with a boy in his
61,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"neighborhood, on which grew another material, indispensable to his"
62,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,project. He found the lad: they jumped into a chaise; rode two or
63,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"three miles to a grove; and, on searching a few moments, found what"
64,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"they were after,--a plant green in mid-winter as well as in summer,"
65,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"and prized by everybody who loves Christmas; gathered a bushel of it,"
66,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"more or less; and got home again before dinner. Meanwhile, the lady,"
67,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"with others to help her, had been busy; and all were wide awake now,"
68,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"entering into the spirit of the matter, thinking that the bright idea"
69,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,of Mr. Perseverance might possibly be accomplished in season. A
70,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"splendid bunch of pure white lilies, not quite open, was fastened to"
71,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"the longest stick, the stems covered with wet paper or moss; then both"
72,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"pieces of wood were wound round with thick and rich evergreen, leaving"
73,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"the glorious flowers standing out gracefully, and white as the"
74,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"new-fallen snow. Next came the motto, in golden letters, on a broad"
75,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"white satin ribbon, which Mrs. Perseverance had found: it was the belt"
76,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"of her bridal dress, carefully preserved for several years, and now"
77,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"devoted to a good cause. The ""emblem"" was completed and packed just in"
78,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"time for the coach. ""And what was it?"" An evergreen cross, with the"
79,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"lilies at the centre; the ribbon hanging as a festoon from the arms,"
80,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,and bearing the words--
81,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,
82,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"""_Consider the Lilies_!"""
83,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,
84,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"On reaching the city, it was much admired, and attracted a good many"
85,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,eyes in the show the next day. I believe there has hardly been a
86,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"""Floral Procession"" since, without a similar device; and among the"
87,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"banners used at the Warren-street Chapel, is a bright one of silk,"
88,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,which has on it the cross and the lilies finely painted.
89,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,
90,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"Now, let me tell you why I have sketched this incident as an"
91,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"introduction to the following pages. On the 24th of December, 1850, a"
92,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"letter came to me from a friend, asking if I was preparing a tract, as"
93,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"in former days, for a New Year's Gift, or if I could help him, his"
94,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"brother and sister teachers, in selecting some fit and cheap book for"
95,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"all the two hundred children they love to meet every Sunday. At first,"
96,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,I only thought of answering that I was sorry to say he must look to
97,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,somebody else for what was wanted. But I did not quite like to do
98,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"this; and, presently remembering the achievement of Mr. Perseverance,"
99,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"I said to myself, if he got that cross made in a few hours, why cannot"
100,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"a tract be made in a few days? I consulted the printer, and he agreed"
101,A BRIGHT THOUGHT SPEEDILY EXECUTED.,"to do all he could. So we went to work immediately, and here are the"

110,GEMS GATHERED IN HASTE.,"To show how great evils may be prevented by a little care, and how"
111,GEMS GATHERED IN HASTE.,"much good a child may do, let me begin with the story of"
112,GEMS GATHERED IN HASTE.,
113,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.
114,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,
115,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"At an early period in the history of Holland, a boy was born in"
116,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"Haarlem, a town remarkable for its variety of fortune in war, but"
117,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,happily still more so for its manufactures and inventions in peace.
118,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"His father was a _sluicer_,--that is, one whose employment it was to"
119,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"open and shut the sluices, or large oak-gates, which, placed at"
120,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"certain regular distances, close the entrance of the canals, and"
121,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"secure Holland from the danger to which it seems exposed, of finding"
122,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"itself under water, rather than above it. When water is wanted, the"
123,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"sluicer raises the sluices more or less, as required, as a cook turns"
124,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"the cock of a fountain, and closes them again carefully at night;"
125,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"otherwise the water would flow into the canals, then overflow them,"
126,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,and inundate the whole country; so that even the little children in
127,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,Holland are fully aware of the importance of a punctual discharge of
128,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"the sluicer's duties. The boy was about eight years old, when, one"
129,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"day, he asked permission to take some cakes to a poor blind man, who"
130,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"lived at the other side of the dyke. His father gave him leave, but"
131,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"charged him not to stay too late. The child promised, and set off on"
132,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,his little journey. The blind man thankfully partook of his young
133,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"friend's cakes; and the boy, mindful of his father's orders, did not"
134,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"wait, as usual, to hear one of the old man's stories; but, as soon as"
135,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"he had seen him eat one muffin, took leave of him to return home."
136,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,
137,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"As he went along by the canals, then quite full,--for it was in"
138,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"October, and the autumn rains had swelled the waters,--the boy now"
139,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,stopped to pull the little blue flowers which his mother loved so
140,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"well; now, in childish gayety, hummed some merry song. The road"
141,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,gradually became more solitary; and soon neither the joyous shout of
142,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"the villager, returning to his cottage-home, nor the rough voice of"
143,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"the carter, grumbling at his lazy horses, was any longer to be heard."
144,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,The little fellow now perceived that the blue of the flowers in his
145,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,hand was scarcely distinguishable from the green of the surrounding
146,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"herbage, and he looked up in some dismay. The night was falling; not,"
147,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"however, a dark winter night, but one of those beautiful, clear,"
148,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"moonlight nights, in which every object is perceptible, though not as"
149,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"distinctly as by day. The child thought of his father, of his"
150,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"injunction, and was preparing to quit the ravine in which he was"
151,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"almost buried, and to regain the beach, when suddenly a slight noise,"
152,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"like the trickling of water upon pebbles, attracted his attention. He"
153,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"was near one of the large sluices, and he now carefully examines it,"
154,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"and soon discovers a hole in the wood, through which the water was"
155,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,flowing. With the instant perception which every child in Holland
156,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"would have, the boy saw that the water must soon enlarge the hole"
157,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"through which it was now only dropping, and that utter and general"
158,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,ruin would be the consequence of the inundation of the country that
159,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"must follow. To see, to throw away the flowers, to climb from stone to"
160,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"stone till he reached the hole, and to put his finger into it, was the"
161,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"work of a moment; and, to his delight, he finds that he has succeeded"
162,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,in stopping the flow of the water.
163,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,
164,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"This was all very well for a little while, and the child thought only"
165,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"of the success of his device. But the night was closing in, and with"
166,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,the night came the cold. The little boy looked around in vain. No one
167,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,came. He shouted--he called loudly--no one answered. He resolved to
168,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"stay there all night; but, alas! the cold was becoming every moment"
169,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"more biting, and the poor finger fixed in the hole began to feel"
170,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"benumbed, and the numbness soon extended to the hand, and thence"
171,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"throughout the whole arm. The pain became still greater, still harder"
172,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,to bear; but still the boy moved not. Tears rolled down his cheeks as
173,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"he thought of his father, of his mother, of his little bed, where he"
174,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,might now be sleeping so soundly; but still the little fellow stirred
175,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"not, for he knew that did he remove the small slender finger which he"
176,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"had opposed to the escape of the water, not only would he himself be"
177,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"drowned, but his father, his brothers, his neighbors--nay, the whole"
178,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"village. We know not what faltering of purpose, what momentary"
179,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"failures of courage, there might have been during that long and"
180,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"terrible night; but certain it is, that, at day-break, he was found in"
181,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,the same painful position by a clergyman returning from attendance on
182,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"a death-bed, who, as he advanced, thought he heard groans, and,"
183,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"bending over the dyke, discovered a child seated on a stone, writhing"
184,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"from pain, and with pale face and tearful eyes."
185,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,
186,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"""Boy,"" he exclaimed, ""what are you doing there?"""
187,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,
188,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"""I am hindering the water from running out,"" was the answer, in"
189,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"perfect simplicity, of the child, who, during the whole night, had"
190,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,been evincing such heroic fortitude and undaunted courage.

196,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,I copy these verses for two reasons. They teach trust in God; and they
197,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,"were written by a gentleman who, I am sure, remembers with pleasure"
198,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,when he was a scholar in the Sunday School; the request of whose
199,THE LITTLE HERO OF HAARLEM.,superintendents induced me to make this miniature book.

204,STORM AT SEA.,We were crowded in the cabin;

229,STORM AT SEA.,"Then we kissed the little maiden,"

246,KINDNESS.,"This word seldom begins an article in a newspaper, but ""cruelty"" or"
247,KINDNESS.,"""murder"" more often instead. It is a pleasure to record an act of"
248,KINDNESS.,kindness; painful that we have not frequent opportunities. Yet such an
249,KINDNESS.,"act made our heart glad, filled it with a new love for our kind, only"
250,KINDNESS.,"a day or two since. A school-girl, about ten years of age, was"
251,KINDNESS.,"passing, with a smaller school-girl in her arms, whom she carried with"
252,KINDNESS.,much difficulty; for the weather was sultry. Other children were in
253,KINDNESS.,"company, with books in their hands. The whole party stopped to rest"
254,KINDNESS.,"under the shade of a tree. Just then, a gentleman observed the group."
255,KINDNESS.,"His attention was particularly attracted by the child, still supported"
256,KINDNESS.,"by the arm of her friend. ""What's the matter, my little Miss?"" he"
257,KINDNESS.,"inquired, in his kind, soft tone. ""She's sick, sir,"" replied the"
258,KINDNESS.,"friend. ""And are you taking her home?"" ""I'm trying, sir."" ""How far off"
259,KINDNESS.,"does she live?"" ""Down by the Long Bridge."" ""A mile or more! and you"
260,KINDNESS.,"would carry her through the hot sun! no shade on the way either!"" ""I"
261,KINDNESS.,"must try, sir,"" answered the school-girl. ""No, you must not,"" said the"
262,KINDNESS.,"kind gentleman, ""it would kill both of you."" A carriage passed at this"
263,KINDNESS.,moment. A word and a waving arm caused it to draw up to the pavement.
264,KINDNESS.,"All the party entered it, and all right merry, except the sick one;"
265,KINDNESS.,"but even she looked up with a faint smile, fixing her large, tender"
266,KINDNESS.,eyes on the face of the stranger. The driver had been instructed fully
267,KINDNESS.,"as to his destination, had been paid too, and now drove away. ""Poor"
268,KINDNESS.,"little girl!"" said the gentleman to himself, in a low voice. ""Good"
269,KINDNESS.,"bye, sir!"" said all the children, in a high tone."

276,A BRAVE BOY.,"An interesting little boy, who could not swim, whilst skating on our"
277,A BRAVE BOY.,"river on New Year's Day, ran into a large air-hole. He kept himself"
278,A BRAVE BOY.,"for a time above water: the little boys, all gathered round the"
279,A BRAVE BOY.,"opening, tried to hand him poles; but the ice continued breaking, and"
280,A BRAVE BOY.,"he was still floating out of reach. Despair at last seized his heart,"
281,A BRAVE BOY.,"and was visible in every face around. At this moment, when, exhausted,"
282,A BRAVE BOY.,"the poor little fellow was about to sink, a brave and generous-hearted"
283,A BRAVE BOY.,"boy exclaimed, ""I cannot stand it, boys!"" He wheeled round, made a"
284,A BRAVE BOY.,"run, and dashed in at the risk of his own life, and seized the little"
285,A BRAVE BOY.,boy and swam to the edge of the ice with him: after breaking his way
286,A BRAVE BOY.,"to the more solid ice, he succeeded in handing him out to his"
287,A BRAVE BOY.,"companions, who then assisted him out. In Rome, this act of heroism"

349,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,
350,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"At Smyrna, the burial-ground of the Americans, like that of the"
351,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"Moslems, is removed a short distance from the town, is sprinkled with"
352,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"green trees, and is a favorite resort not only with the bereaved, but"
353,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,with those whose feelings are not thus darkly overcast. I met there
354,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"one morning a little girl with a half-playful countenance, busy blue"
355,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"eye, and sunny locks, bearing in one hand a small cup of china, and in"
356,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,the other a wreath of fresh flowers. Feeling a very natural curiosity
357,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"to know what she could do with these bright things, in a place that"
358,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"seemed to partake so much of sadness, I watched her light motions."
359,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"Reaching a retired grave, covered with a plain marble slab, she"
360,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"emptied the seed, which it appeared the cup contained, into the slight"
361,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,cavities which had been scooped out in the corners of the level
362,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"tablet, and laid the wreath on its pure face. ""And why,"" I inquired,"
363,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"""my sweet child, do you put the seed in those little bowls there?"" ""It"
364,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"is to bring the birds here,"" she replied with a half-wondering look:"
365,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"""they will light on this tree,"" pointing to the cypress above, ""when"
366,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"they have eaten the seed, and sing."" ""To whom do they sing?"" I asked:"
367,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"""to you or to each other?"" ""Oh! no,"" she quickly replied, ""to my"
368,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"sister: she sleeps here."" ""But your sister is dead?"" ""Oh! yes, sir;"
369,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"but she hears the birds sing."" ""Well, if she does hear the birds sing,"
370,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"she cannot see that wreath of flowers."" ""But she knows I put it there;"
371,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"I told her, before they took her away from our house, I would come and"
372,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"see her every morning."" ""You must"" I continued, ""have loved that"
373,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"sister very much; but you will never talk with her any more, never see"
374,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"her again."" ""Yes, sir,"" she replied, with a brightened look, ""I shall"
375,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"see her always in heaven."" ""But she has gone there already, I trust."""
376,THE SISTER'S GRAVE.,"""No, she stops under this tree till they bring me here, and then we"

484,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"So, my dear little friend, you wish for an answer to your letter, and"
485,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,could not understand that the little feather brush I sent you was a
486,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"reply to your loving remembrance, just as if I had written one with"
487,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,pen and ink. But you were a kind and loving child to transfer the gift
488,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"to little Julia, in your pity for her tears. I hope it soothed her"
489,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"troubled heart, and dried her blue eyes; and you now shall have,"
490,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"instead, the story which those soft feathers were sent to tell."
491,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,
492,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"One evening last summer, Miss L---- came home from one of her rides,"
493,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,with a large basket closely covered; and what do you think it
494,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"contained? Why, a great anxious mother-hen, all tawny-colored and"
495,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"white, with thirteen downy little chickens, who were frightened"
496,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"enough, and wondering where in the wide world they were. We made a"
497,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"house for them in the green meadow, of a barrel turned upside down;"
498,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"and they all crept under their mother's wing, and went to sleep. But,"
499,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"lo! a great storm came in the night, such a pouring rain, such a"
500,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"blowing gale,--we really feared the tiny things would be drowned! But"
501,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"a kind neighbor put on his big coat, and went to their rescue. He put"
502,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"them all together in the basket again, and brought it into the"
503,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"kitchen, where they got thoroughly warm and dry; after which, they"
504,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"were taken out to the barn, where they lived a few days very"
505,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"comfortably. Then one of them disappeared, we never knew where; and"
506,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"another lamed herself in some way, and, notwithstanding all our care,"
507,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"she died. But the rest grew up, a healthy and obedient little family,"
508,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"always ready to eat, and so quick to run with their tiny feet, when"
509,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"any one appeared at the door, that it was very funny to see them."
510,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,
511,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"Another day, Miss L---- brought home two large chickens; one of them"
512,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"with a long neck, and a beautiful black crest upon her head, and a"
513,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,dress of black feathers softer than velvet. Her we named Donna:
514,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,sometimes we call her Bella Donna. The other was dressed in white
515,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"feathers, some of them tipped with glossy black and brown, but many of"
516,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,them pure white. She was named Luca. They were shut together for a few
517,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"days, until they began to feel at home; then they were set free to"
518,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"scratch in the barn-yard, and get acquainted with the neighbors'"
519,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"fowls, when we began to see how different they were in character as"
520,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"well as dress. Donna holds her head very high, and pays no attention"
521,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"to any other hens; runs away from us, when we invite her to dinner, no"
522,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"matter how nice it is; and never will get acquainted, all we can do."
523,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"But Luca we love as we should a gentle, timid little girl. Sometimes,"
524,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"when we open the door, there she stands patiently waiting, and looks"
525,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"up at us with her bright eye so pleasantly, that we must stop, if ever"
526,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"so busy, and feed her. Occasionally we hear a gentle sound on the"
527,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"door-step, which we all know; then some one is sure to exclaim,"
528,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"""There's Luca,"" and run to get her something nice to eat. The little"
529,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"chickens, with Mater their mother, all come rushing, tapping,"
530,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"perching, chirping at the door, and tease and tap-tap and ""yip-p"
531,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"yip-p"" until we quite weary of them. If the door stands open, they fly"
532,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"up the steps, walk in, look round the room, and pick up any thing they"
533,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"can find, until we send them away. The moment their tin pan appears,"
534,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"they are all in a flying huddle, tumble over each other, fly to the"
535,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"pan, to our shoulders, or anywhere, to get the first mouthful. Old"
536,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"Mater is ravenous and impolite as the rest, except that she always"
537,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,waits for her children to get a few mouthfuls first; but not another
538,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"hen or chicken must come near them. Luca, patient gentle Luca, often"
539,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"stands and waits modestly behind; and, if she gets nothing, makes a"
540,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"little mournful sound,--that is all."
541,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,
542,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"Some _flocks_ of russet, black and brown hens, crowers, and chickens,"
543,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"who live close by, are a great annoyance to Mater, and to all of us."
544,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"They come shooting into the yard like little steam-engines, and snatch"
545,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"all they can of the dinner to which they were not invited; and, if"
546,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"driven away a dozen times, rush back, the first chance, to get and"
547,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"devour all they can. Why, they have been into the house, and eaten a"
548,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"pie which was set to cool, pecked at the apples, Pony's oats, and any"
549,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,thing they could find to eat! What would you have said then? Even
550,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"Mater's _children_ never did such impertinent things, hungry as they"
551,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"always are. One white chicken about their size, a naughty-looking"
552,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"little thing, with her head always down, left her own mother, and"
553,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,would come dashing in as if she belonged among them; but Mater and her
554,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"little ones always found her out, and sent her away."
555,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,
556,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"One day we thought we would name the eleven chickens, as Mater could"
557,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"not name them herself; and, since then, we know them each and all, and"
558,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,just how they behave. Annie and Mary are two sober-looking little
559,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"creatures, in quakerish feathers of drab and grey. Nat is a white"
560,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"crower, with beautiful soft feathers, and a long graceful black tail."
561,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"Louise has a shaded dress of grey and white, and is almost as modest"
562,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"and gentle as Luca. Hannah is a little bantam, with tufted head and"
563,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"large eyes, the smallest but the sprightliest of the family: she"
564,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"always tumbles in amongst the rest, and gets the first taste of every"
565,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"thing; and her mother allows her to do it. One of them, named Lise, a"
566,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"white one, came in the other morning, just as we had finished"
567,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"breakfast; and, seeing many things spread out to eat, she flew up to"
568,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"the back of a chair, and, perching herself there, surveyed the whole"
569,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"table, and was very unwilling to get down. At length, getting a little"
570,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"alarmed at our efforts to teach her better, she pounced directly down"
571,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"amidst the cups and dishes, putting her foot into a saucer of tea, and"
572,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"making a great commotion in her fright. Two, named George and John,"
573,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"are trying to learn to crow. Little Mary hears the large hens cackle,"
574,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,and you would laugh loud to hear her try to imitate them. They are
575,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"having warm, new dresses made for them; so they let the summer ones"
576,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"blow about in the breeze for any little girls who want them,"
577,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"particularly kind and neat and useful little maidens, who love to dust"
578,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"their mother's books, picture frames, and flower baskets."
579,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,
580,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"If I can send you another brush, my little friend, you must imagine"
581,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"neat little Louise, Annie and Mary, gentle Luca and handsome Donna,"
582,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"sending their best love and kind wishes, and inviting you to come some"
583,THE FEATHER BRUSH.,"summer's day, to see them eat their dinner, and run about with them in"

829,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
830,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Eudora._ Right glad am I, Rachel, to be once more by your side. The"
831,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"sun has not shone so brightly, nor the birds sung so sweetly, since"
832,DIALOGUE--PART I.,you bade me farewell at my father's; and every moment has increased my
833,DIALOGUE--PART I.,desire to be with you again.
834,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
835,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rachel._ You have well done that you have come to me. And though I
836,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"was not conscious of robbing your lovely home of its brightness, yet"
837,DIALOGUE--PART I.,sure I am the remembrance of your true kindness and tender friendship
838,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"has been to me ever since an increase of sunshine and song; and, now"

841,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
842,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Eudora._ Still faithful, I see, to your temple and Jehovah; and so"
843,DIALOGUE--PART I.,may it ever be! But I trust you have more respect for the gods I
844,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"worship, and will not, as of yore, pronounce them false."
845,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
846,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ Sorry should I be to pain a true heart, and, most of all,"
847,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"that of my much-loved guest; but, still I _must_ say, the gods that"
848,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"you worship are no gods. There is but one God, and that is Jehovah."
849,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
850,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Eudora._ As I came near Jerusalem, I remembered your earnest words on"
851,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"that subject,--as what that you ever uttered have I forgotten? I"
852,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"remembered, too, how nearly out of patience I often felt with you for"
853,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"claiming your god to be the only God; and, so as I drew near, I felt a"
854,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"desire to know him better. It being a time of worship in the temple, I"
855,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"went with a Jewish friend of mine up the hill, and entered the outer"
856,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"court, called, I believe, the Court of the Gentiles. And, verily, I"
857,DIALOGUE--PART I.,saw _no_ god there. Perchance he was in the temple itself.
858,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
859,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ Yes, in the holy of holies: in the farther apartment of that"
860,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"building which you saw rising amid all the courts, he dwells."
861,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
862,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Eudora._ I imagined that was his abode. But wherein differs your
863,DIALOGUE--PART I.,worship from ours? You have a temple; so have we. You have priests
864,DIALOGUE--PART I.,clothed in sacred robes; so have we. You have altars and sacrifices;
865,DIALOGUE--PART I.,so have we. You have an oracle and prophets; so have we. You go up to
866,DIALOGUE--PART I.,the dwelling-place of your God to worship and offer sacrifices; so do
867,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"we. Wherein, then, do we differ?"
868,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
869,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ If in nothing else, Eudora, yet in this: we have but _one_"
870,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"temple and one God for our nation; you have many. And again, you"
871,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"worship the work of men's hands,--images of wood and stone, that can"
872,DIALOGUE--PART I.,neither see nor feel.
873,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
874,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rebecca (coming forward--Jezebel approaches)._ My heart is moved
875,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"within me; and though my sister, in her joy of seeing her friend, has"
876,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"left me standing apart, yet your voice has drawn me to you."
877,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
878,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Eudora._ Surely the sister of my friend shall be my sister: would
879,DIALOGUE--PART I.,that I could say her God shall be my God!

881,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rebecca._ Even so may it be!
882,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
883,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Eudora._ And my gods hers!
884,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
885,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rebecca._ But that is impossible.
886,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
887,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Eudora._ Why? Because, as she says, we have images for gods! But this"
888,DIALOGUE--PART I.,is not so. Is Jupiter the thunderer confined to an image? or is Juno
889,DIALOGUE--PART I.,or any other deity? Have we not many images of all the gods in many
890,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"places, and are they not in them all? Do not our armies go forth to"
891,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"war, and is not Jupiter with them and Mars also? These images are but"
892,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_reminders_ of the gods, as my father's statue is of him."
893,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
894,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rebecca._ 'Tis true these many images and temples may not hold your
895,DIALOGUE--PART I.,gods more than our synagogues hold Jehovah; but as great an error is
896,DIALOGUE--PART I.,yours. You worship what has no existence; your gods are creatures of
897,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"fancy. Your gods, too, are of various character, and not always"

904,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"but one, may not that one be our Jupiter, known as the father of gods"
905,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"and men, as well as your Jehovah?"
906,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
907,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Jezebel_ (To Eudora). _Because he is not._ (To Rachel and Rebecca).
908,DIALOGUE--PART I.,Why do you talk with that stupid Heathen? You might as well convince a
909,DIALOGUE--PART I.,Samaritan dog. I have waited here with a message from David since the
910,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"fifth hour, and all to be contaminated with idolatrous breath."
911,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
912,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ Why, Jezebel, do you not remember what the wise Solomon has"
913,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"said: ""He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that"
914,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city;"" or Moses' commands"
915,DIALOGUE--PART I.,concerning the stranger and hospitality?
916,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
917,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Jezebel._ Well, prate not to me, daughter of Eliab; for I need it"
918,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"not. Tell me if you have fulfilled the mission given you this day, and"
919,DIALOGUE--PART I.,what answer I shall make.
920,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
921,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ I have. Ye only need say, ""It is well."" _[Jezebel departs"

923,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"manners. Did she love Jehovah, she would not thus do."
924,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
925,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Eudora._ And is Jehovah careful about _these_ things?
926,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
927,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Rachel._ Yes: every act is noticed by him; every heart is his desire;
928,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"and herein he differs from all imaginary gods. Jupiter sits apart, and"
929,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"simply _rules_ the nations. Jehovah loves the children he has created,"
930,DIALOGUE--PART I.,and is careful about their least concerns. He desires their love in
931,DIALOGUE--PART I.,return. Your gods demand conduct and sacrifices injurious and
932,DIALOGUE--PART I.,degrading. Jehovah's every word is for his people's prosperity.
933,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
934,DIALOGUE--PART I.,_Eudora._ And you are like your god. Your patient doing of right in
935,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"the past comes to me; and this, with your kindness to the unfeeling"
936,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"and abusive Jezebel, has convinced me more, if possible, than your"
937,DIALOGUE--PART I.,arguments. Surely I see that it was such a god that I desired to
938,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"worship in Jupiter. If this be found alone in your god, then does my"
939,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"heart move me to say, Jehovah, He is God, and there is none else. Oh!"
940,DIALOGUE--PART I.,may I not be mistaken!
941,DIALOGUE--PART I.,
942,DIALOGUE--PART I.,"_Rachel._ Trust in Jehovah, and thou shalt not err."

1009,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1010,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Salome._ Let us not cheat ourselves with any more fanatical dreams.
1011,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1012,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Miriam._ No dream this; no fanatic's voice; no prophet's word, but a"
1013,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,message direct from Heaven.
1014,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1015,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Martha._ A message from Heaven!
1016,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1017,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Leah._ 'Tis even so. Listen while I tell you. At Bethlehem, last"
1018,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"night, the shepherds were watching their flocks as usual; at midnight"
1019,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"they were startled by the sudden appearance of an angel of the Lord,"
1020,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,and the shining round about them of an exceeding bright light; and the
1021,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"angel spoke to them. ""Fear not,"" said he, ""for, behold! I bring you"
1022,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for unto"
1023,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"you is born this day, in the city of David, a _Saviour_, even the"
1024,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"Messiah."""
1025,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1026,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Martha._ Can this be true?
1027,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1028,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Salome._ But how shall he be known?
1029,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1030,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Anna._ In Bethlehem, did you say? But there is no palace in"
1031,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"Bethlehem, where a prince should be born."
1032,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1033,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Leah._ Wait a little: I have not told you all. ""This,"" said the angel"
1034,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"to the shepherds, ""shall be a sign to you. Ye shall find the babe"
1035,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."" And, when he had"
1036,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"thus said, there suddenly joined him a multitude of the heavenly host;"
1037,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"and presently they burst forth into this song,--""Glory to God in the"
1038,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"highest; on earth peace and good will towards men!"" And with this song"
1039,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,they departed.
1040,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1041,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Anna._ This is indeed wonderful!
1042,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1043,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Salome._ But have the shepherds seen the babe?
1044,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1045,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Martha._ Oh! tell us that. Have they seen the babe? and are all
1046,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,things as they have declared?
1047,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1048,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Miriam._ Yes. We met them on their return. They were, with full"
1049,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"hearts, praising God for the new hope of a glorious deliverance given"
1050,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,to the nation.
1051,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1052,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Leah._ All hearts warmed as they spoke; and, catching their gladness,"
1053,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,we come to you.
1054,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1055,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Mary._ Then shall we indeed hope! O my people! my people Israel!
1056,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,shall we see you again in your former glory?
1057,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1058,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Martha._ Surely, this news inspires my own soul. Once more shall the"
1059,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"Roman be driven forth by the Lord of hosts; once more ""shall Jehovah"
1060,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"triumph, and his people be free."""
1061,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1062,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Salome._ Yes; and Messiah shall bring all nations into subjection to
1063,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_us_, as we are now to the Romans."
1064,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1065,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Anna._ Well may we wait a little longer, and bear the yoke with"
1066,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,patience.
1067,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1068,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Mary._ I knew the Lord would not always chide, nor keep his anger for"
1069,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,ever. Now may we rejoice and glory in the God of our salvation.
1070,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1071,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Martha._ Once more shall the name of _a Jew_ be somewhat more than a
1072,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"byword. When our King shall ride forth in his majesty, conquering and"
1073,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"to conquer, then shall the Jews be terrible to their enemies, honored"
1074,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"by their friends, and known everywhere as the people of the whole"
1075,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,earth whom the Lord delighteth to honor.
1076,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1077,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Leah._ Let us tarry no longer here, feasting on these good things"
1078,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"alone; but away; and, in every closet and from every house-top, let us"
1079,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,spread the good news.
1080,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1081,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,"_Mary._ Let us first, however, sing to Jehovah a song of triumph, and"
1082,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,then to our work.
1083,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,
1084,DIALOGUE.--PART II.,_Miriam._ Even so let it be.

1131,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"and JEZEBEL, _Jews._"
1132,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1133,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ Well, Rachel, I owe you more than tongue can tell. The more"
1134,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"I study Moses and the prophets, the more I believe in and love"
1135,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"Jehovah; and the more surprised am I, that, for a moment, I hesitated"
1136,DIALOGUE--PART III.,in giving up the false gods of my childhood.
1137,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1138,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rachel._ To Jehovah be your thanks, my friend, my sister; for never"
1139,DIALOGUE--PART III.,by human reasoning should we have been different from you. In love
1140,DIALOGUE--PART III.,Jehovah revealed himself to us; and what we have so fully learned from
1141,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"him, we have given to you."
1142,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1143,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ But what think you of the prophet in the wilderness,--John I"
1144,DIALOGUE--PART III.,think they call him?
1145,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1146,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rachel._ He is dead. He was a bold man, and a good one, I think; but"
1147,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"the best should be careful how they rebuke kings. John rebuked Herod,"
1148,DIALOGUE--PART III.,and lost his head in consequence thereof.
1149,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1150,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ Well, we must all die."
1151,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1152,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rachel._ Not so says he whom John declared to be greater than
1153,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"himself,--Jesus of Nazareth."
1154,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1155,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Zachariah._ If he be what many claim him, he speaks with more"
1156,DIALOGUE--PART III.,authority on that point than the Pharisees.
1157,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1158,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Eudora._ And what do people say he is?
1159,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1160,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Zachariah._ The Messiah.
1161,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1162,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Eudora._ Israel's Deliverer?
1163,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1164,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Zachariah._ Yes.
1165,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1166,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ Well, what says he?"
1167,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1168,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_John._ That they who believe in him shall never die.
1169,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1170,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ Surely, no one believeth that. Or does he jest, by saying"
1171,DIALOGUE--PART III.,what he knows they cannot receive?
1172,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1173,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rachel._ You have never seen him, or you would not ask that question."
1174,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"No one hearing him can doubt, that he, like John, would seal his words"
1175,DIALOGUE--PART III.,with his blood.
1176,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1177,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_John._ You have seen him: is he like John?
1178,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1179,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rachel._ In boldness very like him. In other respects they differ.
1180,DIALOGUE--PART III.,John was clothed like the prophets; Jesus wears the common garb. John
1181,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"dwelt in the wilderness, and on the banks of the Jordan; but Jesus"
1182,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"frequents the cities and villages. John was stern in manner, and"
1183,DIALOGUE--PART III.,abstemious in food; Jesus is neither. He is gentle and social; often
1184,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"seen at the feasts of the publicans, and associating with the"
1185,DIALOGUE--PART III.,multitudes.
1186,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1187,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ But does he, like the former kings of Israel, combine"
1188,DIALOGUE--PART III.,military ardor with his religious enthusiasm?
1189,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1190,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rachel._ He seems, with all his boundless benevolence, formed to"
1191,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"command; but never has he aimed to form an army, though the people"
1192,DIALOGUE--PART III.,would at one time have declared him king. Salome promised to meet us
1193,DIALOGUE--PART III.,here at this time. I wish she were present. She can tell you more of
1194,DIALOGUE--PART III.,him than can I.
1195,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1196,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Eudora._ And here she is.
1197,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1198,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_John._ Welcome to our circle! and doubly so now; for we would hear of
1199,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"you concerning this Jesus, who we hoped was to be our deliverer from"
1200,DIALOGUE--PART III.,bondage.
1201,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1202,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ Right glad am I to be here, and more so to speak of him; for"
1203,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"he hath come indeed to deliver us from bondage,--a worse, however,"
1204,DIALOGUE--PART III.,than _Roman_ bondage.
1205,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1206,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_John._ Are we to have a harder taskmaster than the Romans, before we"
1207,DIALOGUE--PART III.,are delivered?
1208,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1209,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Salome._ No harder master than we now have. The Roman is not our only
1210,DIALOGUE--PART III.,or worst bondage.
1211,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1212,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ What talk you of so earnestly?
1213,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1214,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Salome._ Jesus of Nazareth.
1215,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1216,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rebecca._ He has come, it is said, to set up a new kingdom."
1217,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1218,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Salome._ Rather to enlarge the kingdom already flourishing in heaven.
1219,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1220,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rebecca._ Call it what you may, he is slow in gathering his armies."
1221,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1222,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ He needs no army for his conquests, but an army of loving"
1223,DIALOGUE--PART III.,hearts and pure spirits.
1224,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1225,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rebecca._ Then the nation's hope is again blasted, and we are to"
1226,DIALOGUE--PART III.,remain yet longer subjects of a foreign king.
1227,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1228,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Salome._ Not so. This is the true Messiah: he who joins his kingdom
1229,DIALOGUE--PART III.,shall be free indeed.
1230,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1231,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ But what freedom can there be greater than from Roman
1232,DIALOGUE--PART III.,bondage?
1233,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1234,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ Unless it be a deliverance, such as mine, from idolatry and"
1235,DIALOGUE--PART III.,superstition. Methinks there is no liberty to be compared with that;
1236,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"and, having that, slavery loses its power."
1237,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1238,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Jezebel._ Or deliverance, such as mine, from an unholy temper."
1239,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"Surely, Eudora, mine is the greater deliverance; for what is truth"
1240,DIALOGUE--PART III.,without goodness? You were delivered from _error_; I from _sin._ Oh!
1241,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"since I have been from place to place with the Son of God, and"
1242,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"listened to his gracious words, I have forgotten to be angry; and, I"
1243,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"trust, my growing love for his Father and mine will cleanse me from"
1244,DIALOGUE--PART III.,all sin!
1245,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1246,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Mary._ I, too, have felt his power, and am seeking to join his"
1247,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"kingdom. I first took him for a second David, who should glorify his"
1248,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"people; then, when no army gathered around him, for a prophet sent to"
1249,DIALOGUE--PART III.,reform the nation. But now I believe him to be greater than
1250,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"either,--even the Son of God, and begin to think that he purposes to"
1251,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"bless, not Jews alone, but Gentiles; not Palestine, but the world."
1252,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1253,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rebecca._ Why should we think him greater than the prophets? why, the"
1254,DIALOGUE--PART III.,Son of Jehovah? Are the reports about his working miracles to be
1255,DIALOGUE--PART III.,received as true?
1256,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1257,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ Certainly; for I have witnessed them. I have, at his mere"
1258,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"word or touch, _seen_ the leper cleansed; the blind receive sight; the"
1259,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"lame walk; and, that last wonderful work, Lazarus of Bethany raised"
1260,DIALOGUE--PART III.,from the dead.
1261,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1262,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ And what think you of all this?
1263,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1264,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ Just what one of our rulers declared to him the other night,"
1265,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"""No man can do these miracles and not come from God, and have God with"
1266,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"him."" When the Pharisees or the Scribes tell me I am immortal, I"
1267,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"question; but when he, thus aided by Jehovah, asserts the truth, it is"
1268,DIALOGUE--PART III.,enough.
1269,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1270,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca (to Mary)._ And did this move you also?
1271,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1272,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Mary._ How could I doubt any doctrine of his, after witnessing these"
1273,DIALOGUE--PART III.,works?
1274,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1275,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Jezebel._ But this is not all. He moved our hearts to love, as well"
1276,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"as our minds to believe. With all my ill temper in the past, I have"
1277,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"ever taken an interest in children. Judge ye, then, of the effect"
1278,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"produced upon me, the first time I saw him, by this circumstance. I"
1279,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"was walking along, filled with my usual impatience, when I suddenly"
1280,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"saw Jesus at a distance, surrounded by a crowd, many of whom were"
1281,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"Scribes and Pharisees. He had pleased the multitude, and excited even"
1282,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"the admiration of his enemies; when, as I came nigh, I saw several"
1283,DIALOGUE--PART III.,persons endeavoring to get nearer to him with their children. They
1284,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"were rebuked even by his disciples; but Jesus, seeing the act, asked"
1285,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"for the children, took them in his arms, and blessed them. From that"
1286,DIALOGUE--PART III.,moment have I loved and followed him.
1287,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1288,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Mary._ Then came his kind, yet firm rebuke of sin; his description of"
1289,DIALOGUE--PART III.,those who were prepared to join his kingdom; his promise to receive
1290,DIALOGUE--PART III.,the worst who would become like himself; his assurance that all who
1291,DIALOGUE--PART III.,continued faithful to the end of this life should in the next be
1292,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"joined to his Father's family; and, above all, the representation of"
1293,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"Jehovah as our Father, who would give us eternal joy. Oh! what change"
1294,DIALOGUE--PART III.,have his glorious words wrought in us!
1295,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1296,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Rebecca._ Why do you say ""changed _us_""? _Jezebel_ needed to be"
1297,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"changed, but not _you._"
1298,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1299,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Mary._ Such change as he demanded I needed. Oh! how much! 'Tis true,"
1300,DIALOGUE--PART III.,in _form_ I have served the God of my fathers. I have endeavored to
1301,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"keep unbroken the law; but that was not sufficient. To be like him,"
1302,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"the _heart_ must burn with that love to his Father, that your delight"
1303,DIALOGUE--PART III.,will be even to be crucified in his service.
1304,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1305,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ Yes; as Mary says, he demands that love which not only pours"
1306,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"itself forth to friends, but to strangers, and with diligence seeks"
1307,DIALOGUE--PART III.,the happiness even of our bitterest foes.
1308,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1309,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Zachariah._ O that I might have such a spirit, and be one of such a"
1310,DIALOGUE--PART III.,society!
1311,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1312,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Mary._ And so you may.
1313,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1314,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_John._ And I!
1315,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1316,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ And I!
1317,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1318,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Salome._ Yes; all, _all_ who are weary of sin, and heavy laden with"
1319,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"cares,--all may come, and none will be cast forth."
1320,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1321,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_John._ This is freedom indeed.
1322,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1323,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rachel._ And greatness indeed.
1324,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1325,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ Such a people must be the chosen of the Lord.
1326,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1327,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"_Eudora._ No longer Jew and Gentile, but one in Jesus."
1328,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1329,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Salome._ Is not this a Saviour for Israel? Oh! my heart burns within
1330,DIALOGUE--PART III.,me for joy; for all people shall partake of this salvation.
1331,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1332,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rachel._ Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace and good-will to
1333,DIALOGUE--PART III.,men!
1334,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1335,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Mary._ The angel's song; and why should not we in a song praise God
1336,DIALOGUE--PART III.,that he hath visited and redeemed his people?
1337,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1338,DIALOGUE--PART III.,_Rebecca._ And may God make us true to this Saviour to the last!
1339,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1340,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1341,DIALOGUE--PART III.,Next came an appropriate hymn; after which the pastor reviewed and
1342,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"explained the meaning of the different exercises of the evening, and"
1343,DIALOGUE--PART III.,what they were intended to teach about the origin and truth and
1344,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"blessedness of Christianity. A prayer was offered, and the services"
1345,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"closed with that noble hymn, beginning ""All hail the power of Jesus'"
1346,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"name,"" sung to that noble old tune, ""Coronation."""
1347,DIALOGUE--PART III.,
1348,DIALOGUE--PART III.,"I thought the Dialogues would please you, and asked leave to print"
