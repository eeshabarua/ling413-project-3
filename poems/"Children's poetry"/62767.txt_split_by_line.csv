72,THE MILLER.,THE MILLER.
73,THE MILLER.,
74,THE MILLER.,
75,THE MILLER.,"If, ’mid the passions of the breast,"
76,THE MILLER.,"There be one deadlier than the rest,"
77,THE MILLER.,Whose poisonous influence would control
78,THE MILLER.,"The generous purpose of the soul,"
79,THE MILLER.,"A cruel selfishness impart,"
80,THE MILLER.,"And harden, and contract the heart;"
81,THE MILLER.,"If such a passion be, the vice"
82,THE MILLER.,Is unrelenting Avarice.
83,THE MILLER.,And would my youthful readers know
84,THE MILLER.,"The features of this mortal foe,"
85,THE MILLER.,The lineaments will hardly fail
86,THE MILLER.,To strike them in the following tale.
87,THE MILLER.,
88,THE MILLER.,In England—but it matters not
89,THE MILLER.,That I precisely name the spot—
90,THE MILLER.,"A Miller liv’d, and humble fame"
91,THE MILLER.,Had grac’d with rustic praise his name.
92,THE MILLER.,For many a year his village neighbours
93,THE MILLER.,Felt and confess’d his useful labours;
94,THE MILLER.,"Swift flew his hours, on busy wing"
95,THE MILLER.,Revolving in their rosy ring:
96,THE MILLER.,"His life, alternate toil and rest,"
97,THE MILLER.,"Nor cares annoy’d, nor want oppress’d."
98,THE MILLER.,
99,THE MILLER.,"Whang’s mill, beside a sparkling brook,"
100,THE MILLER.,Stood shelter’d in a wooded nook:
101,THE MILLER.,"The stream, the willow’s whispering trees,"
102,THE MILLER.,"The humming of the housing bees,"
103,THE MILLER.,Swell’d with soft sounds the summer breeze;
104,THE MILLER.,"Those simple sounds, that to the heart"
105,THE MILLER.,"A soothing influence impart,"
106,THE MILLER.,And full on every sense convey
107,THE MILLER.,Th’ impression of a summer’s day.
108,THE MILLER.,
109,THE MILLER.,"A cot, with clustering ivy crown’d,"
110,THE MILLER.,"Smil’d from a gently sloping mound,"
111,THE MILLER.,"Whose sunny banks, profusely gay,"
112,THE MILLER.,"Gave to the view, in proud display,"
113,THE MILLER.,The many colour’d buds of May;
114,THE MILLER.,"Flowers, that _spontaneous_ fringe the brink"
115,THE MILLER.,"Of sinuous Tame, and bend to drink."
116,THE MILLER.,My native River! at thy name
117,THE MILLER.,What mix’d emotions thrill my frame!
118,THE MILLER.,"Through the dim vista of past years,"
119,THE MILLER.,How shadowy soft thy scene appears!
120,THE MILLER.,"With earliest recollections twin’d,"
121,THE MILLER.,To thee still fondly turns my mind;
122,THE MILLER.,While Memory paints with faithful force
123,THE MILLER.,The grace of thy meandering course
124,THE MILLER.,"’Neath bending boughs, whose mingling shade"
125,THE MILLER.,"Now hid, and now thy stream betray’d.—"
126,THE MILLER.,Bright—though long distant from my view—
127,THE MILLER.,Rise all thy magic charms anew;
128,THE MILLER.,And on thy calm and shallowy shore
129,THE MILLER.,"Again, in Fancy’s eye, I pore,"
130,THE MILLER.,"The steps retrace, our infant feet"
131,THE MILLER.,"So buoyant trod, and once more meet"
132,THE MILLER.,Each object in my wandering gaze
133,THE MILLER.,That form’d the joys of “other days.”
134,THE MILLER.,"All, all return, and with them bring"
135,THE MILLER.,"The “life of life,” its vivid spring."
136,THE MILLER.,"The sun is bright, the flowers re-bloom,"
137,THE MILLER.,"Cold friends are kind, kind e’en the tomb:"
138,THE MILLER.,For one brief moment ’tis forgot
139,THE MILLER.,"There once _were_ those, who now _are not_."
140,THE MILLER.,"Eyes beam, and hearts as fondly beat,"
141,THE MILLER.,Voices their wonted tones repeat—
142,THE MILLER.,But ’tis on Fancy’s ear alone—
143,THE MILLER.,"I wake, alas! and _all are gone_!"
144,THE MILLER.,
145,THE MILLER.,"Yet, Tame, the theme of childish praise,"
146,THE MILLER.,For thee were fram’d my earliest lays;
147,THE MILLER.,"Thy banks of all were deem’d the pride,"
148,THE MILLER.,"Thy flowers, by none to be outvied."
149,THE MILLER.,Those days are past—and sad I view
150,THE MILLER.,"The time I bade thee, Tame, adieu:"
151,THE MILLER.,"Those days are gone, and I have seen"
152,THE MILLER.,Full many a river’s margent green;
153,THE MILLER.,Full many a bursting bud display
154,THE MILLER.,The rich luxuriance of May—
155,THE MILLER.,"But loveliest _still_ thy flowers I deem,"
156,THE MILLER.,"And dearest thou, my native stream!"
157,THE MILLER.,
158,THE MILLER.,Thus clings around our early joys
159,THE MILLER.,"A mystic charm no time destroys,"
160,THE MILLER.,"Endearing recollections more,"
161,THE MILLER.,When all of _real_ joy is o’er.
162,THE MILLER.,
163,THE MILLER.,"Forgive, Whang, this digressive strain;"
164,THE MILLER.,"The journey done, I’m yours again."
165,THE MILLER.,If for a simile I sought
166,THE MILLER.,"Back through the distant tracks of thought,"
167,THE MILLER.,The flowers I gather’d by the way
168,THE MILLER.,Upon your fabled banks I lay;
169,THE MILLER.,Where primrose groups were yearly seen
170,THE MILLER.,"Peeping beneath their curtain green,"
171,THE MILLER.,"With aromatic mint beside,"
172,THE MILLER.,And violets in purple pride.
173,THE MILLER.,"In gay festoons, o’er hazles thrown,"
174,THE MILLER.,Hung many a woodbine’s floral crown;
175,THE MILLER.,"The brier-rose too, that woos the bee,"
176,THE MILLER.,"And thyme, that sighs its odours free."
177,THE MILLER.,"The lark, the blackbird, and the thrush,"
178,THE MILLER.,Hymn’d happiness from every bush:
179,THE MILLER.,The Eden to their lot assign’d
180,THE MILLER.,Fill’d with content the feather’d kind;
181,THE MILLER.,"Example worthy _him_, I ween,"
182,THE MILLER.,Who reign’d sole monarch of the scene—
183,THE MILLER.,"The Miller.——“What!” you will enquire,"
184,THE MILLER.,“Possess’d he not his soul’s desire?
185,THE MILLER.,Ah! could his wishes soar above
186,THE MILLER.,The calm of this untroubled grove?”
187,THE MILLER.,Alas! his frailty must be told—
188,THE MILLER.,Whang entertain’d a love for gold:
189,THE MILLER.,"And none, whatever their demerit,"
190,THE MILLER.,"That did of wealth a store inherit,"
191,THE MILLER.,But gain’d (so strong the dire dominion)
192,THE MILLER.,"Whang’s reverence, and his best opinion."
193,THE MILLER.,"“_Gold_, my dear spouse,” would cry his wife,"
194,THE MILLER.,“Is call’d an _evil_ of our life.”
195,THE MILLER.,"“True,” Whang rejoin’d, “the only _evil_"
196,THE MILLER.,Whose visits I consider civil;
197,THE MILLER.,"But ’tis, alack!—the thought is grievous—"
198,THE MILLER.,_The evil_ most in haste to leave us.”
199,THE MILLER.,
200,THE MILLER.,"’Twere proper that my readers knew,"
201,THE MILLER.,"That, by _degrees_, this passion grew;"
202,THE MILLER.,Not _always_ was the silly elf
203,THE MILLER.,"So craving, coveting of pelf,"
204,THE MILLER.,Though he was ever prone to hold
205,THE MILLER.,In high esteem _pound-notes_ and _gold_:
206,THE MILLER.,And CIRCUMSTANCES sometimes root
207,THE MILLER.,Firm in the mind the _feeblest_ shoot;
208,THE MILLER.,"A truth, erewhile, this man of meal"
209,THE MILLER.,By his example will reveal.
210,THE MILLER.,
211,THE MILLER.,"“True,” would he say, “I am not poor:"
212,THE MILLER.,What then? may I not wish for more?
213,THE MILLER.,"This paltry mill provides me food,"
214,THE MILLER.,Keeps dame and I from famine—good!
215,THE MILLER.,"Yet, mark the labour I endure,"
216,THE MILLER.,A meagre living to secure.
217,THE MILLER.,"’Tis lucky that I have my health,"
218,THE MILLER.,Since this poor mill is all my wealth;
219,THE MILLER.,"Though irksome, I confess, to toil"
220,THE MILLER.,"To catch Dame Fortune’s niggard smile,"
221,THE MILLER.,When she so prodigal can be
222,THE MILLER.,"To men of less desert than me,"
223,THE MILLER.,"Throwing her bounties in their lap,"
224,THE MILLER.,Almost without their asking—slap!
225,THE MILLER.,"’Twas but to-day that I was told,"
226,THE MILLER.,"With truth I’ll vouch, a pan of gold"
227,THE MILLER.,Seen by a neighbour in a dream—
228,THE MILLER.,"—Thrice dreamt on, though, as it should seem—"
229,THE MILLER.,"My neighbour dug for, as directed—"
230,THE MILLER.,(Shame had such warning been neglected!)—
231,THE MILLER.,"Dug for, and, better still, he found"
232,THE MILLER.,"A treasure hidden under ground,"
233,THE MILLER.,"In the same spot, or thereabout,"
234,THE MILLER.,His happy dream had pointed out.
235,THE MILLER.,"Such riches _now_ his coffers fill,"
236,THE MILLER.,"No more he labours, let who will."
237,THE MILLER.,"I wish with all my heart,” he cried,"
238,THE MILLER.,“I wish such luck may me betide!”
239,THE MILLER.,"So saying, from the bags he started,"
240,THE MILLER.,"While through his brain vague fancies darted,"
241,THE MILLER.,And with a brisker air and gait
242,THE MILLER.,"He left the mill to seek his Kate,"
243,THE MILLER.,The golden vision to relate.
244,THE MILLER.,"At eve, before the cottage-door,"
245,THE MILLER.,They talk’d the wondrous story o’er;
246,THE MILLER.,"And every time it was repeated,"
247,THE MILLER.,With warmer hope Whang’s brain was heated.
248,THE MILLER.,"Complacent to his bed he hies,"
249,THE MILLER.,"Certain, when sleep should close his eyes,"
250,THE MILLER.,Like _him_ to dream who gain’d the prize:
251,THE MILLER.,And doubtless _might_ have dream’d the same;
252,THE MILLER.,But neither sleep nor vision came.
253,THE MILLER.,"He toss’d and turn’d him all night long,"
254,THE MILLER.,Tried all manœuvres—all were wrong.
255,THE MILLER.,"“Had never known the like before,"
256,THE MILLER.,"Was us’d to sleep quite sound, and snore;"
257,THE MILLER.,"But now, when he desir’d it most,"
258,THE MILLER.,The art to sleep seem’d wholly lost.”
259,THE MILLER.,
260,THE MILLER.,When Hope (t’ indulge a short digression)
261,THE MILLER.,"Gains of weak minds complete possession,"
262,THE MILLER.,"She buoys them up, like cork and sail,"
263,THE MILLER.,’Gainst Disappointment’s heavy gale.
264,THE MILLER.,"So Whang, with undishearten’d mind,"
265,THE MILLER.,"Trusting the _future_ would be kind,"
266,THE MILLER.,Rose from his dreamless bed next morn
267,THE MILLER.,Neither discourag’d nor forlorn:
268,THE MILLER.,"With one idea fill’d, he sought"
269,THE MILLER.,"His mill, but little there he wrought."
270,THE MILLER.,"Week follow’d week, and months the same,"
271,THE MILLER.,"Whang slept indeed, but could not dream;"
272,THE MILLER.,"Yet, prescient still of his success,"
273,THE MILLER.,His industry grew less and less.
274,THE MILLER.,"He thought it wrong in him to labour,"
275,THE MILLER.,"Who, by and by, might, like his neighbour,"
276,THE MILLER.,"Receive the happy wish’d-for warning,"
277,THE MILLER.,And wake to thousands in the morning!
278,THE MILLER.,It was amusing to observe
279,THE MILLER.,"His solemn pomp, his proud reserve,"
280,THE MILLER.,"His sad exchange of glee, for state,"
281,THE MILLER.,That ill-beseem’d his rustic gait.
282,THE MILLER.,"His temper open, far from vicious,"
283,THE MILLER.,Chang’d too—for he was grown ambitious.
284,THE MILLER.,"He, that so early erst was seen"
285,THE MILLER.,"With active step to cross the green,"
286,THE MILLER.,"Now slept, supinely slept away"
287,THE MILLER.,"The prime, the golden hours of day."
288,THE MILLER.,The sun shot down his highest beam
289,THE MILLER.,Upon th’ unprofitable stream;
290,THE MILLER.,Whang’s duty bade him sleep and dream.
291,THE MILLER.,I will not say but Whang was born
292,THE MILLER.,"With sense enough to grind his corn,"
293,THE MILLER.,Or on a market-day to tell
294,THE MILLER.,Whether ’twere good to buy or sell;
295,THE MILLER.,"But since the store his neighbour found,"
296,THE MILLER.,I dare not say his wits were sound.
297,THE MILLER.,In sad neglect the mill-wheel stood
298,THE MILLER.,That long supplied his daily food;
299,THE MILLER.,"And marvelling neighbours shook the head,"
300,THE MILLER.,Amaz’d the Miller’s glee was fled.
301,THE MILLER.,Some thought his conscience overcast
302,THE MILLER.,Was but a judgment for the _past_.
303,THE MILLER.,Old Robin with a wink could tell
304,THE MILLER.,That “Whang had manag’d matters well;
305,THE MILLER.,"He shrewdly guess’d how things would end,"
306,THE MILLER.,"For gain, ill-gotten, would not spend.”"
307,THE MILLER.,And Gammer Gabble _now_ could prate
308,THE MILLER.,That her “last sack had wanted weight.”
309,THE MILLER.,"_She_ “knew the Miller long ago,"
310,THE MILLER.,And wonder’d _others_ did not know.”
311,THE MILLER.,So all most prudently prepare
312,THE MILLER.,To trust their grain to better care.
313,THE MILLER.,"Thus, by degrees the stores declin’d,"
314,THE MILLER.,Till Whang had scarce a batch to grind.
315,THE MILLER.,No matter! Hope still talk’d the more
316,THE MILLER.,About his unfound hidden store:
317,THE MILLER.,But inauspicious yet appear’d
318,THE MILLER.,His wish; no warning voice was heard.
319,THE MILLER.,"Now Mistress Whang, of nature humble,"
320,THE MILLER.,"Had smil’d to hear her husband grumble,"
321,THE MILLER.,"And would admonish him, ’tis said,"
322,THE MILLER.,To chase vain phantoms from his head.
323,THE MILLER.,"She, more incredulous, insisted"
324,THE MILLER.,His visions ought to be resisted;
325,THE MILLER.,"Thought they had chang’d his very nature,"
326,THE MILLER.,And sourly curl’d each homely feature:
327,THE MILLER.,She felt full dearly they bestood
328,THE MILLER.,Sad substitutes for wholesome food.
329,THE MILLER.,
330,THE MILLER.,"At issue long, as oft the case,"
331,THE MILLER.,The war of words to peace gave place.
332,THE MILLER.,In truth the visionary Whang
333,THE MILLER.,Ceas’d now entirely to harangue
334,THE MILLER.,"On this dear theme:—he hated _doubt_,"
335,THE MILLER.,"And Kate had many, staunch and stout:"
336,THE MILLER.,"And in a hostile muster, they"
337,THE MILLER.,Gave her the better of the fray.
338,THE MILLER.,"Though silent on his favourite theme,"
339,THE MILLER.,"He did resolve, when he _should_ dream,"
340,THE MILLER.,"And _find_ th’ anticipated pelf,"
341,THE MILLER.,To _keep_ the secret to _himself_;
342,THE MILLER.,For he averr’d it “quite vexatious
343,THE MILLER.,His wife should be so pertinacious.”
344,THE MILLER.,No passions vain _her_ heart misled:
345,THE MILLER.,The path of humble peace to tread
346,THE MILLER.,"Was her sole aim; of this secure,"
347,THE MILLER.,"She felt content, nor sigh’d for more."
348,THE MILLER.,"She griev’d to find her counsels failing,"
349,THE MILLER.,"They were sincere, though unavailing;"
350,THE MILLER.,"And oft midst wishes, fears, and sighs,"
351,THE MILLER.,’Twas thus she would soliloquise:—
352,THE MILLER.,“My pretty window! that commands
353,THE MILLER.,"Those meadows green, and wooded lands,"
354,THE MILLER.,"So sunny, that the latest ray"
355,THE MILLER.,Its panes receive of parting day.
356,THE MILLER.,"O! with what joy, when near it plac’d,"
357,THE MILLER.,I’ve watch’d my husband homeward haste!
358,THE MILLER.,"Or heard, from fair returning late,"
359,THE MILLER.,"The welcome sounds of ‘Holla, Kate!’"
360,THE MILLER.,Through it I trace on every hand
361,THE MILLER.,"Beauties, would grace a fairy-land,"
362,THE MILLER.,"And think that, like a grateful eye,"
363,THE MILLER.,It smiles on all beneath the sky.
364,THE MILLER.,"There, too, my sweet geranium blows,"
365,THE MILLER.,"And mignionette, and crimson rose,"
366,THE MILLER.,When all without is clad in snows.
367,THE MILLER.,"I doubt me, if a princess feels"
368,THE MILLER.,"More joy than that which o’er me steals,"
369,THE MILLER.,"When light and morn my slumbers break,"
370,THE MILLER.,And to this blissful scene I wake.
371,THE MILLER.,I cannot form a wish beside
372,THE MILLER.,"What Heaven’s bounty has supplied,"
373,THE MILLER.,Save that to Whang I could impart
374,THE MILLER.,The same content that fills my heart;
375,THE MILLER.,"Yield him that thankful state of rest,"
376,THE MILLER.,Or teach to _prize the good possess’d_.”
377,THE MILLER.,
378,THE MILLER.,Good fortune seldom comes too late;
379,THE MILLER.,For lo! at last indulgent Fate
380,THE MILLER.,"Smil’d on the importunate swain,"
381,THE MILLER.,And eas’d at length his anxious pain.
382,THE MILLER.,"Dreams—one,—two,—three,—th’ important number,"
383,THE MILLER.,"Omen’d him hence to quit his slumber,"
384,THE MILLER.,"With spade and mattock arm’d, to delve"
385,THE MILLER.,"Six feet—nay, I believe ’twas twelve,"
386,THE MILLER.,Close by the long-forsaken mill—
387,THE MILLER.,"He flies, the mission to fulfil!"
388,THE MILLER.,"The mattock rings, the spade descends,"
389,THE MILLER.,The sturdy arm its vigour lends;
390,THE MILLER.,At such light labour who could sleep?
391,THE MILLER.,Whang is already three feet deep!
392,THE MILLER.,Upon the spade observe him smile:
393,THE MILLER.,What sees he?—what?—a broken tile;
394,THE MILLER.,"The very tile his dream foretold,"
395,THE MILLER.,A landmark to his pan of gold!
396,THE MILLER.,Upturns one token more—a bone!
397,THE MILLER.,"And now, behold the broad flat stone!"
398,THE MILLER.,A moment on its ample size
399,THE MILLER.,He gaz’d with wide distended eyes—
400,THE MILLER.,“Beneath _that_ is the pan!” he cries.
401,THE MILLER.,“’Twas under such a stone as this
402,THE MILLER.,That neighbour Drowsypate found his.
403,THE MILLER.,"So then, at last, my hopes are crown’d!"
404,THE MILLER.,"Come, then, let’s raise thee from the ground.”"
405,THE MILLER.,"But, ere to lift the stone he tries,"
406,THE MILLER.,"He shook his head, not over wise,"
407,THE MILLER.,"And, with a self-approving glance,"
408,THE MILLER.,"One foot a little in advance,"
409,THE MILLER.,"With nose and lip contemptuous curl’d,"
410,THE MILLER.,"That said, “A fig for all the world!”"
411,THE MILLER.,"He cried, “My wife, she, silly trot!"
412,THE MILLER.,Shall never know the wealth I’ve got:
413,THE MILLER.,To punish her I made a _vow_;
414,THE MILLER.,"The time is come, I’ll keep it now."
415,THE MILLER.,"She could not dream, poor fool! not she;"
416,THE MILLER.,"Some trite old tale of ‘busy bee,’"
417,THE MILLER.,"Of saving pins, and pence, and groats,"
418,THE MILLER.,For ever occupied _her_ thoughts.
419,THE MILLER.,"Besides, the hussey laugh’d outright"
420,THE MILLER.,Whene’er I pass’d a dreamless night.
421,THE MILLER.,"Yes, yes, I will requite her scorn;"
422,THE MILLER.,"She’ll rue it, sure as she is born!”——"
423,THE MILLER.,"Ah, bootless boast! the stone so great"
424,THE MILLER.,Exceeds by far his strength in weight.
425,THE MILLER.,"In vain he digs and delves the ground,"
426,THE MILLER.,"And clears away the rubbish round,"
427,THE MILLER.,"And gathering strength with his vexation,"
428,THE MILLER.,Widens the fearful excavation.
429,THE MILLER.,He cannot move the stone for life;
430,THE MILLER.,"So forc’d at last, he calls his wife,"
431,THE MILLER.,"Imparts the fact so long repress’d,"
432,THE MILLER.,"And glads, reluctantly, her breast."
433,THE MILLER.,The news he stated wak’d her fear;
434,THE MILLER.,"What gave delight at first to hear,"
435,THE MILLER.,One apprehension turn’d to pain—
436,THE MILLER.,She trembled for her husband’s brain.
437,THE MILLER.,"“Can it be true?” cried she, misdeeming;"
438,THE MILLER.,"“Dear Whang, too surely thou _art dreaming_:"
439,THE MILLER.,"Try, recollect thyself, good man—”"
440,THE MILLER.,"“Tut, hussey! why, I’ll shew the pan:"
441,THE MILLER.,"Only a minute’s help I ask,"
442,THE MILLER.,And thou shalt see’t—a trifling task
443,THE MILLER.,"Just to remove, I know not what,"
444,THE MILLER.,"A stone, it may be, from the spot."
445,THE MILLER.,"Come, come, thy hand.” They gain the door,"
446,THE MILLER.,"When, turning, Kate asks, “_Are you sure?_”"
447,THE MILLER.,"“_Sure? yes_,” vociferates her spouse."
448,THE MILLER.,"This said, they issue from the house—"
449,THE MILLER.,"“I’m _certain_, as to all I’ve told,"
450,THE MILLER.,As if e’en _now_ I _touch’d_ the _gold_:
451,THE MILLER.,_Sure_ as that I no more will bear
452,THE MILLER.,This russet doublet now to wear:—
453,THE MILLER.,That I no more will condescend
454,THE MILLER.,"To own Ralph Roughspeech for _my friend_,"
455,THE MILLER.,Nor tolerate the pert monition
456,THE MILLER.,"Of neighbours, in my chang’d condition:"
457,THE MILLER.,"_Sure_—but, ye Powers! what do I see?—"
458,THE MILLER.,The mill! the mill!—Oh! woe is me!
459,THE MILLER.,"My only stay, my certain aid,"
460,THE MILLER.,All level with the earth is laid!——
461,THE MILLER.,"Presumptuous! I have scorn’d my fate,"
462,THE MILLER.,And wrought this mischief: all too late
463,THE MILLER.,"The error of my life I see,"
464,THE MILLER.,And misery my portion be.
465,THE MILLER.,"Time, that no more I may recal,"
466,THE MILLER.,"By wise men priz’d, and dear to all,"
467,THE MILLER.,How have I squander’d! how abus’d!
468,THE MILLER.,"My friends, my neighbours, basely us’d!"
469,THE MILLER.,"How shall I bear, acquaintance meeting,"
470,THE MILLER.,Scorn to behold where once was greeting?
471,THE MILLER.,Now comes _their_ turn to treat the fool
472,THE MILLER.,"With jeers, contempt, and ridicule."
473,THE MILLER.,Laugh’d at on all sides—and to know
474,THE MILLER.,And _feel_ I have _deserv’d_ the blow!
475,THE MILLER.,Undone by mine own discontent!—
476,THE MILLER.,But ah! too late I do repent.
477,THE MILLER.,"Forc’d now in poverty to roam,"
478,THE MILLER.,I soon must quit this quiet home;
479,THE MILLER.,"And where with thee, poor Kate! to fly?—"
480,THE MILLER.,Oh! I could lay me down and die!
481,THE MILLER.,"Wretch that I am! Kate, Kate, forgive!”"
482,THE MILLER.,"“_My_ pardon, dearest Whang, receive:"
483,THE MILLER.,"But ’twas not _I_ who gave thee health,"
484,THE MILLER.,"Strength, talent to improve thy wealth;"
485,THE MILLER.,"Who cast thy lot in such fair land,"
486,THE MILLER.,Or bless’d thee with such liberal hand.
487,THE MILLER.,O! turn to _Him_ with thankful prayer
488,THE MILLER.,Who deigns e’en yet thy life to spare;
489,THE MILLER.,Implore His pardon—kneel with me;
490,THE MILLER.,This ruin might have cover’d _thee_.
491,THE MILLER.,"But thou art spar’d, and yet remain"
492,THE MILLER.,The means our livelihood to gain:
493,THE MILLER.,A heartfelt willing perseverance
494,THE MILLER.,Will mend our lot before a year hence.
495,THE MILLER.,Thou knowest well that neighbour Ralph
496,THE MILLER.,Each morn will spare an hour or half
497,THE MILLER.,To help us to repair the mill.”
498,THE MILLER.,"“Doest think,” Whang blushing ask’d, “he will?”"
499,THE MILLER.,"“Yes, yes, I do believe so too,"
500,THE MILLER.,He was a neighbour kind and true;
501,THE MILLER.,"And if his counsels gave offence,"
502,THE MILLER.,The fault was in my want of sense.
503,THE MILLER.,"Yet, ideot! I”—“Enough!” cried Kate,"
504,THE MILLER.,Exulting in her alter’d mate;
505,THE MILLER.,"“To see our faults in their just light,"
506,THE MILLER.,Is next akin to acting right.
507,THE MILLER.,But time no longer let us waste;
508,THE MILLER.,I’ll to friend Roughspeech quickly haste:
509,THE MILLER.,"Own thou, meanwhile,” she smiling cried,"
510,THE MILLER.,“To have a help-mate in thy bride
511,THE MILLER.,Is _treasure perhaps_ of equal worth
512,THE MILLER.,With _aught conceal’d beneath the earth_.”
513,THE MILLER.,"With look of conscious proud delight,"
514,THE MILLER.,"She caught the sound of, “Kate, thou’rt right;”"
515,THE MILLER.,While a “small voice” responsive join’d
516,THE MILLER.,Applausive music in her mind.
517,THE MILLER.,
518,THE MILLER.,"Then turn’d she from the yawning ground,"
519,THE MILLER.,"And, eying Whang with thought profound,"
520,THE MILLER.,"Saw in his look, on her that bent,"
521,THE MILLER.,A meaning most intelligent.
522,THE MILLER.,"A wish defin’d she saw, and knelt;"
523,THE MILLER.,Beside her soon his form she felt:
524,THE MILLER.,"Then, with join’d hands uplift in air,"
525,THE MILLER.,Burst from their lips the ardent prayer.
526,THE MILLER.,"With brighter hopes from earth they rose,"
527,THE MILLER.,Nor long (—for so the story goes)
528,THE MILLER.,In idle wailings spent the day:
529,THE MILLER.,Just then a neighbour pass’d that way.—
530,THE MILLER.,Whang turn’d his head; a crimson streak
531,THE MILLER.,"Rush’d hastily across his cheek,"
532,THE MILLER.,And Cath’rine’s palpitating breast
533,THE MILLER.,A momentary shame confess’d:
534,THE MILLER.,"For well they knew, Old Robin’s tale"
535,THE MILLER.,"Soon through the village would prevail,"
536,THE MILLER.,"And bring a host about their ears,"
537,THE MILLER.,"With pity some, and some with jeers."
538,THE MILLER.,But _guilt_ and _folly_ must endure
539,THE MILLER.,The _caustics_ that effect a cure.
540,THE MILLER.,"Whang therefore strove, with patient heart,"
541,THE MILLER.,To bear th’ anticipated smart;
542,THE MILLER.,Nor vainly strove: the threaten’d ill
543,THE MILLER.,"Fell, he with patience met it still."
544,THE MILLER.,Few in the morning of his grief
545,THE MILLER.,"Or gave, or proffer’d him relief."
546,THE MILLER.,"Those who had _counsell’d heretofore_,"
547,THE MILLER.,"Excus’d themselves from doing more,"
548,THE MILLER.,“Presuming nothing _they_ could offer
549,THE MILLER.,Would meet acceptance from the scoffer.”
550,THE MILLER.,"Others, meanwhile, of nature good,"
551,THE MILLER.,"Assisted, comforted, withstood"
552,THE MILLER.,"With honest scorn the worldling’s cant,"
553,THE MILLER.,"Nor shunn’d a neighbour, though in want."
554,THE MILLER.,"To all, Whang bore an humble mien,"
555,THE MILLER.,"By all, his contrite spirit’s seen;"
556,THE MILLER.,"Till even they who smil’d at first,"
557,THE MILLER.,"When o’er his head the tempest burst,"
558,THE MILLER.,"Were forc’d, in justice, to declare"
559,THE MILLER.,His penitence _appear’d sincere_.
560,THE MILLER.,"“They trusted, nay, _almost believ’d_"
561,THE MILLER.,His loss of character retriev’d:”
562,THE MILLER.,"And, soften’d by his chang’d address,"
563,THE MILLER.,"“Good fortune _wish’d_, and happiness.”"
564,THE MILLER.,
565,THE MILLER.,And he _was_ happy—“he was bless’d
566,THE MILLER.,"Beyond desert,” he oft confessed,"
567,THE MILLER.,"By friends, by all the good caress’d."
568,THE MILLER.,"A smiling garden, rescu’d mill,"
569,THE MILLER.,"His dear old cottage on the hill,"
570,THE MILLER.,"A faithful wife, a conscience clear,"
571,THE MILLER.,Shed brightness on each coming year.
572,THE MILLER.,
573,THE MILLER.,"The church-yard stone, that bears his name,"
574,THE MILLER.,Records his failing and his fame;
575,THE MILLER.,"And, in his life and death, conveys"
576,THE MILLER.,A moral truth to future days.
