60,TO THE THIRD SERIES.,In this as well as in all the other Series nothing has been permitted

81,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
82,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
83,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"George Washington, late President of the United States, always spoke"
84,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"the truth. During his whole life he had great regard for truth, and was"
85,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"never known, under any circumstance, to make a false statement."
86,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
87,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"When he was about six years old, a friend of his gave him a hatchet."
88,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"George thought it a very fine present and was constantly going about,"
89,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,chopping every thing that came in his way.
90,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
91,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"One very pleasant morning, he walked out into his father's garden with"
92,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"his hatchet in his hand. It was a beautiful garden, in which were"
93,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"flowers, of various kinds, such as pinks, lilies, lilachs, roses, &c."
94,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,which greeted the eye at every step. George was delighted with the
95,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,prospect around him.
96,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
97,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,In the east end of the garden was a quantity of pea-bushes which had
98,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,been placed there by his excellent mother. These bushes were dry and
99,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,dead so that the hacking of George's hatchet on them did not do much
100,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"hurt, except to weaken their strength and make them less able to bear"
101,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,the weight of peas that might grow on the pea-vines.
102,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
103,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,But George had the misfortune thoughtlessly to try the edge of his
104,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,hatchet on the body of a beautiful young English cherry-tree which he
105,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,injured so much that it scarcely if ever got over it.
106,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
107,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"On the following morning his papa, in his walk in the garden, observed"
108,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"the injury done to his favourite cherry-tree, and after walking awhile,"
109,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"returned to the house, and inquired of the different members of the"
110,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"family whether any of them knew who had done the mischief, remarking,"
111,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"at the same time, that he would not have taken five dollars for the"
112,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"tree. No one was able to inform him, for there was no person in the"
113,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,garden with George when he cut the tree.
114,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
115,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,Presently George made his appearance with his hatchet in his hand.
116,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
117,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"""George,"" said his papa, ""do you know who killed that beautiful little"
118,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"cherry-tree yonder in the garden?"""
119,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
120,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"[Illustration: _Little George with his Hatchet in his hand, and his"
121,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,Papa pointing to the ruined Cherry-tree._]
122,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
123,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"This was an unpleasant question, and George staggered under it for a"
124,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"moment; then looking at his papa, he bravely cried out ""I can not tell"
125,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"a lie, papa; you know I can not tell a lie, I did it with my little"
126,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"hatchet!"" ""Run to my arms, my dearest boy"", said his papa, ""you have"
127,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,paid me for my tree a thousand times; I freely forgive you for killing
128,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"it; and I hope my son will always be hero enough to tell the truth, let"
129,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"what will come."""
130,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,
131,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,I hope all my young friends will be as honest as little George
132,ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH.,"Washington was, and remember _always to speak the_ TRUTH."

138,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
139,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
140,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"In a delightful town in New England, there lived a family of the name"
141,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,of Davis. Their residence was in a neat little cottage in a beautiful
142,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"valley on the bank of a river, whose waters glided smoothly by the side"
143,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,of their humble but happy mansion. Mr. Davis had two daughters who were
144,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"twins. Mrs. Davis took great pains to dress them alike, and always to"
145,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,have them make a neat appearance. Their names were Helen and Maria.
146,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"In pleasant, warm weather, they often took a walk by the river, and"
147,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"were much pleased with the delightful groves and scenery, which their"
148,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,handsome valley presented to their view.
149,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
150,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,[Illustration: _Helen and Maria meet an old Gentleman with his little
151,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,Dog by his side._]
152,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
153,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"One fine morning they were neatly dressed by their mamma, and walked"
154,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"out as usual. A short distance from the house, they met an old"
155,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"gentleman who was very kind, wealthy, and friendly, and very fond of"
156,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"good children. His residence was in a very splendid mansion, in a"
157,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,village about two miles from the cottage of Mr. Davis. He wore a plain
158,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"coat and an old-fashioned hat. Owing to his advanced age, he made use"
159,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"of spectacles--all which gave him a very grave appearance. The girls,"
160,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"who were then about ten years of age, had been taught by their good"
161,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"and excellent mamma, that aged people who conduct themselves properly,"
162,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"should always be treated with kindness, respect, and attention. They,"
163,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"therefore, as they came near the old gentleman, made a polite and"
164,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,modest courtesy to him.
165,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
166,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"Mr. Walker, (which was the name of the old gentleman), spoke very"
167,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"kindly to the girls, and inquired about their health and other matters"
168,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"connected with their family. Helen, who was not as diffident as Maria,"
169,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"answered Mr. Walker very frankly and modestly, and in such an artless"
170,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,manner that he was much pleased.
171,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
172,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,He inquired of them whether they would not prefer a residence in the
173,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"village. They both informed him, that they chose rather to remain in"
174,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,their cottage than in any other place. They had all the comforts of
175,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,life; and there they were able to take a walk by the side of their
176,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,delightful river. They could also raise their own fowls and milk their
177,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"own cows, all which was very nice sport for them."
178,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
179,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,They said there were many things which people who live in the village
180,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"have that they, in their humble cottage, could not have; yet they"
181,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"were quite happy, as they never wished for any thing which their kind"
182,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,parents were not able to furnish them.
183,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
184,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,The old gentleman was quite surprised at their candid and simple
185,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"manners, as well as their wise and discreet remarks, and left them, and"
186,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"returned home, fully convinced that people who live in cottages may be"
187,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"happy, though they are poor, if they are only contented."
188,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,
189,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"All young persons should remember, that contentment renders every good"
190,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"thing that we may enjoy doubly sweet; and that, without contentment,"
191,THE TWO COTTAGE GIRLS.,"they would be wretched, if they had the richest palace for a dwelling."

197,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
198,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
199,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,Eliza and Harriet were two very lovely girls. Eliza was twelve years
200,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"old, and Harriet, her little sister, was six years old. Eliza was"
201,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"a very kind and good girl, and extremely fond of her little sister"
202,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"Harriet; who was also a sweet, pleasant child. Whenever their mamma"
203,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"purchased any thing for Eliza, or if she had a present of any thing,"
204,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"she always divided it equally with Harriet; and, if she wished any of"
205,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"her playthings, she would at once lend them to her, and never quarrel"
206,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"with her, or tease her."
207,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
208,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"The house in which they lived stood on a pleasant and delightful spot,"
209,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,from which all the surrounding country could be viewed. In rear of the
210,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"house stood a beautiful and stately sugar maple-tree, the branches of"
211,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"which spread over nearly all of the yard, and extended over a part of"
212,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"the roof of the house. Under this large tree, Eliza and Harriet spent"
213,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"a great deal of time, when they were not in school and the weather was"
214,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,pleasant. There they sometimes amused themselves with their dolls and
215,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"other playthings, and sometimes Eliza would amuse Harriet with little"
216,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"stories which had been told to her, or which she had read in her little"
217,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"books. When they took a walk together, Eliza would take Harriet by the"
218,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"hand, and lead her along very carefully, always keeping her out of the"
219,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,dirt and wet places.
220,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
221,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"One fine morning they arose very early, and took a walk to inhale the"
222,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"pure air of the hills and mountains, just as the sun came forth to look"
223,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"upon the beauties of creation, while the lark soared high above them"
224,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"on its happy wings. Eliza was delighted with the sight; and, putting"
225,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"her left hand gently on Harriet's shoulder, pointed to the Lark with"
226,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"her right hand. Harriet took off her bonnet, and put up her right hand"
227,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"to screen her eyes from the dazzling rays of the sun, while she looked"
228,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"at the beautiful bird. After they had walked a little farther, they"
229,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,returned home very cheerful and much refreshed.
230,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
231,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"[Illustration: _Eliza pointing to the Lark, soaring in the sky._]"
232,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
233,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,One day her little sister Harriet wished her to teach her how to sew.
234,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"So Eliza very patiently threaded the needle for her, made the knots in"
235,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"the ends of the thread, and basted down the hems for her, until Harriet"
236,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,was able to do these things herself.
237,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
238,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"Eliza takes care of her own clothes and always folds them up neatly,"
239,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"and shows her little sister to do so too; and, therefore, she knows"
240,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,where they are and can find them in the dark as well as in the light.
241,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"When she and Harriet come home from school, she takes the school books"
242,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"out of the basket, and puts them in their proper place, and never"
243,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"leaves them scattered about, to be in the way of her mamma."
244,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,
245,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"Eliza and Harriet were both such excellent children, that their mamma"
246,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,scarcely ever had any occasion to chide them or find fault with them;
247,ELIZA AND HARRIET.,"and, all who were acquainted with them, esteemed them very highly."

254,THE CROSS GIRL.,
255,THE CROSS GIRL.,Huldah Jones is a very cross and peevish little girl. When she wishes
256,THE CROSS GIRL.,"any thing, she always whines or frets at the time she asks for it; and,"
257,THE CROSS GIRL.,never speaks in a pleasant manner.
258,THE CROSS GIRL.,
259,THE CROSS GIRL.,"[Illustration: _Mrs. Jones washing Huldah's face, so that she could go"

261,THE CROSS GIRL.,
262,THE CROSS GIRL.,"When it is time for Huldah to go to school, and her mamma wishes to"
263,THE CROSS GIRL.,"wash her face and hands, and comb her hair, she always murmurs or"
264,THE CROSS GIRL.,"appears sulky, and scarcely ever bids her mamma good morning, or sets"
265,THE CROSS GIRL.,off cheerful and happy as good girls do. I hope none of my young female
266,THE CROSS GIRL.,friends are like Huldah Jones.

274,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"Peter was always inclined to do what was not prudent, and would"
275,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,not mind what was said to him. At one time he would get upon the
276,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"window-seat, and be in imminent danger of falling out of the window;"
277,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"at another time he would climb up on the back of a chair, so as to be"
278,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,in danger of falling when the person should rise who was sitting on the
279,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,chair.
280,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,
281,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"One day Peter wished to have some apples; and, his mamma told him that"
282,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,she would send for some to the orchard as soon as the hired man should
283,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"come in to his dinner. Peter, who was then but six years old, told his"
284,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"mamma, that he could climb the tree and get some himself. His mamma"
285,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"answered him, that she feared he would fall and hurt him badly. He"
286,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"waited a few moments for the man to come; and, as soon as his mamma was"
287,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"out of sight, ran to the orchard, got into one of the trees, fell, and"
288,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,"broke his arm. Poor Peter wept bitterly, when the Doctor came to set"
289,THE IMPRUDENT BOY.,the broken bone!
