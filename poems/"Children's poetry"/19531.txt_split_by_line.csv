42,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Punky Dunk, very sly, with a wink of his eye"
43,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Strolled lazily all through the house;
44,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,To the cellar he went and the morning he spent
45,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,On a hunt for a fat little mouse.
46,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
47,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
48,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
49,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""Over there by the coal,"" he said, ""Mouse has his hole,"
50,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,So I'll sit there beside it and wait.
51,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"There's a trap with some cheese just as nice as you please,"
52,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And Mouse soon will come out for that bait."""
53,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
54,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
55,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
56,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Punky sat by the trap, and seemed taking a nap,"
57,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,But you know that bold Punky was wise.
58,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Though he looked half asleep he was taking a peep
59,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,For the gleam of two bright little eyes.
60,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
61,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
62,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
63,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Soon the mouse crept right out and went running about;
64,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Punky smiled to himself and he said:
65,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""I will just let him play in his own foolish way"
66,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Till I think that I need to be fed."""
67,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
68,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
69,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
70,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"But the Mouse, too, was smart, and he got a good, start,"
71,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Then he leaped, and he saved his wee hide,"
72,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,For he dashed in a hole that was not near the coal
73,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,But was hidden away at one side.
74,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
75,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
76,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
77,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""Ha, Ha!"" Punky said as he shook his white head."
78,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""Well, Mouse, you may run if you please,"
79,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"But I'll eat just the same--'twas for that that I came."""
80,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,So he reached in the trap for the cheese.
81,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
82,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
83,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
84,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Snip-snap! went the trap-- Wasn't that a mishap!
85,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Punky's black little paw was inside.
86,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,He leaped and he jumped and he ran and he bumped--
87,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And the Mouse sat and laughed till he cried.
88,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
89,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
90,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
91,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Punky ran up the stairs and he knocked over chairs
92,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And he sprang to the table and dropped,"
93,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"He ""Meowed!"" in his fright, for the trap held him tight,"
94,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And it was a long time till he stopped.
95,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
96,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
97,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
98,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Baby's mama then came and she said: ""What a shame!"""
99,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And she took off the trap from his paw,"
100,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And she wrapped it in silk and she fed him with milk
101,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And she gave him some fish bones to gnaw.
