57,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
58,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
59,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",IF you’ll sit on my knee
60,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","As still as a stone,"
61,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",And listen to me
62,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",While we’re all alone—
63,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","While the wind whistles cold,"
64,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And the snow falls so fast,"
65,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",While the young and the old
66,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Feel the chill of the blast—
67,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",I will tell you about
68,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",A poor little lad
69,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Who now, without doubt,"
70,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Is smiling and glad.
71,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
72,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
73,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",(_His picture._)
74,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
75,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Brown and curly his head,"
76,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Bright blue was his eye,"
77,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","His feet bare and red,"
78,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",His look rather shy;
79,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","His face, somewhat soiled,"
80,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Unfamiliar with soap,"
81,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Was thin, while there curled"
82,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","In his neck, like a rope,"
83,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
84,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Certain locks which had grown,"
85,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Unhindered by shears
86,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","That he never had known,"
87,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","You would think, all his years;"
88,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","His shirt was a sight,"
89,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","You may think, to behold,"
90,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Through which shone the light
91,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Unblushingly bold.
92,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
93,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","His trousers, in shreds,"
94,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","His legs dangled round,"
95,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Long needing the threads
96,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Which they never had found;
97,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",While his cap—what was left
98,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Of the original pattern—
99,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Of all shape was bereft,"
100,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",And looked like a slattern.
101,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
102,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Such, such was the creature"
103,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Who stood in the door;
104,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","In dress, form and feature—"
105,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Nothing less, nothing more."
106,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","May you love this, my lad"
107,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",From the slums of the city;
108,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Not think him all bad,"
109,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",But regard him with pity.
110,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
111,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
112,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",(_The name._)
113,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
114,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Though nameless he stood
115,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Clad in rags in that door,"
116,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Whether evil or good,"
117,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",He is nameless no more.
118,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","We’ll call him hereafter,"
119,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","If you make no objection,"
120,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","In tears—or in laughter,"
121,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",On further reflection—
122,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Thomas Tinker, all told,"
123,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But “Tommy” for short,"
124,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Until he grows old—
125,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Perhaps then, when in sport."
126,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
127,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But I’ll tell you I think, sir,"
128,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Before saying more,"
129,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",This is not the “Tom Tinker”
130,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","You’ve heard of before,"
131,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But another, whose fame"
132,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Is as worthy of mention
133,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",As the first of his name
134,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Who claimed your attention.
135,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
136,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
137,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",(_The story._)
138,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
139,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","We will trace him as we may, on his way"
140,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","From that doorstep, where at play on that day;"
141,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",We will see just how he earned
142,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","That for which his young heart yearned,"
143,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",How from good he firmly turned not astray.
144,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
145,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Selling papers he began, little man,"
146,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Then on errands often ran, like a “van”;"
147,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Then his matches he would sell,"
148,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Blacking boots the while, as well;"
149,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",And with cheerful voice would tell all his plan.
150,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
151,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Tried his courage was, I’m told; nor condoled"
152,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","By humanity, which rolled, with its gold,"
153,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","On its laughing, rushing way,"
154,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Like a crowd of boys at play,"
155,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Or a flock of sheep astray from the fold.
156,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
157,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But his heart was brave and true, and he knew"
158,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",That to flinch would never do; so say you?
159,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Thus he bravely bore his part
160,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","With a true and loyal heart,"
161,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Never doubting from the start; “tried and true.”
162,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
163,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",The days seemed often long; but his song
164,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Rang brave and strong; just the song
165,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Of the wares he had to sell;
166,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Of the news they had to tell—
167,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Good and bad alike as well, for the throng."
168,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
169,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And he worked, and worked away, every day,"
170,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","With his heart as light and gay, as the May;"
171,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And he did his level best, late and early;"
172,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Never grumbling, never sad, and never surly;"
173,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","With a smile ’neath his golden head and curly, as at play."
174,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
175,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","So he fought the fiends of hunger and of cold, true as gold;"
176,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Like a veteran tried and bold, I am told,"
177,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Was this soldier in life’s battle
178,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",’Mid the daily hum and rattle;
179,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Driven forth like sheep or cattle, to be sold."
180,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
181,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Many brave fall by the way, every day;"
182,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Some survive, their country’s stay; well they may;"
183,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",But of all the rank and file
184,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Grandly marching up the aisle
185,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Of stern duty, all the while, who can say"
186,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
187,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Which the most deserve the name, writ in fame?"
188,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Those who fell ’mid shot and flame, on land or main,"
189,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Or those who in obscurer strife
190,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Have given heart, and soul, and life"
191,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","For husband ill, for child, or wife, in duty “tame”?"
192,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
193,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Well, Tommy stood, sturdy and grave—no slave—"
194,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",His soul had what we well might crave; no knave
195,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Was he; but faithful in the daily fight,"
196,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Cheerful, happy, eager, bright—"
197,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","A nineteenth century valiant knight, youthful, brave."
198,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
199,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Perhaps you’d like to know his foes, who arose"
200,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",To strike him down with deadly blows. Who knows
201,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",But such as he? Who else can tell
202,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","The horrid shapes, the cruel spell"
203,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",These demons from the pit of hell disclose?
204,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
205,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","“Hunger,” you say, “sickness and cold; no fold;"
206,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","No home that such as he might hold, to mould"
207,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And make them good, and true, and wise?”"
208,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Ah, yes! and on the streets before his eyes"
209,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Were Satan’s minions in disguise; so bold!
210,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
211,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","These dens of ill, they grow, you know;"
212,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","We find them everywhere as we go, ready to throw"
213,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Their snares with fiendish skill.
214,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Almost ’twould seem, to suit their will,"
215,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",They’d gorge earth’s prisons to their fill below.
216,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
217,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","God looked on Tommy in the fight for right,"
218,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Saw darkness struggling with the light, so bright—"
219,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",That light which shone on Eastern plain
220,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Where shepherds heard angelic strain
221,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Such as will surely come again some night.
222,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
223,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","God knew about the thrall, the small,"
224,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Weak hands which yet might fall, the call"
225,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",Which all too loud might prove to be
226,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","For one so young, so little helped as he,"
227,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","So tempted oft, and yet withal so free to fall."
228,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
229,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And so, one cold Thanksgiving Day, so gay"
230,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","With jingling bells, and sleigh and play,"
231,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","The father sent a messenger in love,"
232,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","To take poor Tommy to his home above,"
233,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Where, clad in garments whiter than the dove, he’ll stay."
234,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
235,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","And now no more he’ll walk that street, where sleet"
236,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",And slush so cruel hurt his feet; repeat
237,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","No more his song of paper vending,"
238,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Shiver no more while restless horse attending,"
239,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But join in song triumphant, never ending and sweet."
240,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.",
241,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","But on this day of this November, remember"
242,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Tommies there are, with feet as cold and tender, remember,"
243,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","As his once were, who now on golden strand"
244,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","Meet rich and poor, of this and every land."
245,"A STORY TO REMEMBER, IN NOVEMBER.","These need your store, your love, your helping hand, remember!"

251,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.
252,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
253,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
254,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"THEY were great friends, Robert Truesdale and Claire Waterman. During"
255,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the long, bright summer at the seashore they spent as much time"
256,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"together as possible, and discussed all sorts of questions. They had"
257,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"opinions concerning everything under the sun, and agreed so well,"
258,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"generally, that to find a subject upon which they totally differed only"
259,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,added interest to the summer.
260,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
261,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,One of these subjects was found one morning when they sat together on
262,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the beach. It began—that is, the discussion did—by Robert’s making the"
263,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,astonishing statement that he never went to circuses.
264,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
265,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,Claire stopped playing with the sand which she was letting run idly
266,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"through her fingers, and turned so that she could see his face. “How"
267,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,very queer!” she said; “I thought all boys went to circuses. Did you
268,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,never go?”
269,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
270,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“I went once,” said Robert, low-voiced, “when I was quite a little"
271,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"fellow, and that was once too often. I never cared to try it again.”"
272,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
273,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,“I cannot imagine why. I think circuses are splendid. We never go in
274,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the city, of course. Why, they don’t have circuses in cities, do they?"
275,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,But I go to my Auntie’s every summer for two months—I always have until
276,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,this summer—and Uncle West takes us children to the circus just as
277,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,regularly. That is the reason I like the country so much better than
278,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the city, you can go to such queer out-of-door things. And I think the"
279,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,little circus ponies are too cunning for anything; I have always wanted
280,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"one for my own. Mamma laughs, and says she doesn’t know but I will be a"
281,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,circus rider when I grow up—and then the clown is so funny. Why don’t
282,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"you want to go, Robert? What happened when you went once? Was there an"
283,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,accident?”
284,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
285,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“No,” said Robert slowly, “I suppose not; I am afraid it was an"
286,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"every-day affair. It is a long story, Claire, and begins away back of"
287,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"that day. I have been brought up differently from you, you know. My"
288,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"father was a minister, and he and my mother did not approve of shows"
289,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"of that kind, and I was never taken to them when I was a small boy. I"
290,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"never heard nor thought much about them; we lived in a large town, but"
291,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"not too large for the traveling circus; but I got the idea, somehow,"
292,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"that only low people attended such places, and never coaxed to go.”"
293,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
294,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"Claire exclaimed over this, “Why, Robert, where my Auntie lives"
295,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"everybody goes, only the minister and a few old dried-up people.”"
296,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
297,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,[Illustration: “HOW VERY QUEER!”]
298,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
299,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“Yes, I know,” said Robert gravely; “some people in the country have"
300,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,different views from those which my father and mother had; but I did
301,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,not know it when I was a little chap; I thought that all respectable
302,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,people thought alike. The first time I changed my ideas any was when I
303,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,had gone to spend the year with my Grandmother in the country—that was
304,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the summer after mother died, and my father had died the winter before."
305,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,I found that a great many country people went to circuses. All the boys
306,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,and girls who went to school with me in the little old schoolhouse were
307,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,looking forward to going as a matter of course; and I heard more talk
308,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,about the circus that summer than I had ever heard in my life before.
309,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"I began to want to go very much. The more I talked with the boys, the"
310,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,more I became convinced that it was because my father was a minister
311,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,that I had been held away from such places. ‘Of course ministers ought
312,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"not to go,’ I told myself, ‘because’—and there I would have to stop; I"
313,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"knew no reason why they should not go where other people did, and could"
314,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,not reason about it any better than some grown people can nowadays;
315,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"still I called it a settled point, and began to coax my grandmother to"
316,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"let me go to the circus. ‘Just this once,’ I said to her; ‘I want to"
317,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,see for myself.’
318,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
319,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“I have never understood how she came to let me have my way, unless it"
320,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"was because she was a very indulgent grandmother, and pitied the orphan"
321,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"boy, and could not bear to say ‘No.’ Any way, I received permission,"
322,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"and the necessary quarter of a dollar, and started off in great glee."
323,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
324,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“I ought to tell you,” he continued, after a slight hesitation—and the"
325,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,flush on his brown cheek deepened a little—“that although I was only
326,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"a little fellow ten years old, I was a member of the church, and was"
327,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,trying to live my religion. There was a ragged little boy not much
328,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"older than myself, very ignorant and neglected, but a leader in all"
329,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"sorts of mischief, whom I had had ambitions to help. I had been kind to"
330,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"him, instead of making sport of his rags, as the other boys did, until"
331,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"I had a certain sort of influence over him, and he had partly promised"
332,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,me to try to be a better boy.
333,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
334,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“Well, I went to the circus, and saw the ponies, and heard the"
335,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"jokes, and was delighted; but as I stood around outside afterwards,"
336,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"open-mouthed and open-eyed, I saw two of the men whom I had most"
337,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"admired in the ring, fighting. They had been drinking just enough to"
338,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"make them quarrelsome, and such horrid oaths as they were using I had"
339,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,never even imagined possible before. I stood still with fright and
340,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"horror and watched the blows, and listened to the vile language, until"
341,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"somebody touched my elbow, and there was little Pete, the ragged boy."
342,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"He was grinning wickedly. ‘My eyes!’ he said, ‘was you in there?’"
343,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,nodding toward the tent. ‘I was struck all of a heap when I see you
344,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,come out. I didn’t think this kind was for you. I thought you belonged
345,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"to the “goody-goodies,” you know. Miss Wheeler, she said when she was"
346,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"talking to us fellows about it, “O, no! Robert Truesdale won’t go to"
347,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"the circus, I am sure; he is his father’s own boy, and is walking the"
348,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"same road he did.” I guess you got off the road this time, didn’t you?’"
349,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
350,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,“I do not believe I shall ever forget the wicked leer in the little
351,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,fellow’s face as he said those words; and I am sure I shall never
352,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,forget the feeling of shame which I had as I looked at those two
353,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"dreadful men with the blood streaming down their faces, and the vile"
354,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"words streaming from their mouths, and realized that I had spent my"
355,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"afternoon in laughing at their speeches, and had been found out of the"
356,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,road in which my father had walked—so far out that this street boy had
357,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"noticed it! I turned and ran away as fast and as far as I could, and I"
358,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,do not think I shall ever attend another circus.”
359,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,
360,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,"“How very strange!” said Claire; “but then, after all, Robert, bad men"
361,ROBERT TRUESDALE’S LOGIC.,will swear and drink and fight. You did not make them any worse by

386,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,MY neighbor’s little boy one evening saw his teacher coming up the lane
387,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,and called her in to take a look at his pet fawn.
388,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
389,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Well, if he didn’t get half a foot taller since I saw him last,” said"
390,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"the teacher; “if he keeps on like that, Tommy, he will be a big deer"
391,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,the first thing you know.”
392,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
393,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Yes, he’s growing,” said Tommy; “but I wanted to see you about"
394,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"something else. He seems to be sick, and we do not know what to do"
395,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,about it.”
396,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
397,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Why, he looks all right now; what seemed to be the matter with him?”"
398,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
399,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“He doesn’t eat,” said Tommy, “and he upset his water dish when I tried"
400,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,to make him drink. I went up on the hill to get him the best grass I
401,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"could find, but it’s no use; he must be sick.”"
402,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
403,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Let me see that grass,” said the teacher. “I thought so,” she laughed,"
404,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,when Tommy took her to the fawn’s fodder corner; “you got a lot of
405,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"wormwood leaves mixed up with the grass, and one of the leaves got in"
406,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,that water dish.”
407,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
408,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"Tommy stared. “Oh! maybe that’s the reason he upset his water,” he"
409,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,burst out; “but I had no idea that would make any difference. What
410,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"makes him so very particular about a few leaves, I wonder?”"
411,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
412,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“You will know if you taste them,” said the teacher; “and maybe your"
413,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,fawn wanted to get even with you for teaching him to jump through a
414,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,hoop.”
415,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
416,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Why, he seems to like that,” laughed Tommy."
417,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
418,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“That’s just what I mean,” said the teacher; “he felt so much obliged"
419,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,to you and wanted to pay you back—by teaching you a good lesson. An
420,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"animal, you see, won’t touch any bad-tasting food if it is in good"
421,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"health, and if you give it the wrong kind of drink it doesn’t mind its"
422,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"thirst, but waits till it gets something better. And that’s an answer"
423,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"to the question you asked me a few weeks ago, when you wanted to know"
424,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,how people could help getting fond of drinks that make them drunk and
425,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"sick. They should let such stuff alone altogether, if they find out"
426,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,it does not taste right at first. You found out something about that
427,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"yourself, didn’t you?”"
428,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
429,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“About what—the ugly taste of bad drinks, you mean?”"
430,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
431,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,“Yes; don’t you remember what you told me about that hotel where you
432,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"got thirsty, and tried a glass of something you thought was lemonade,"
433,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,and found it was beer?”
434,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
435,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“O, yes! I remember,” laughed Tommy; “I never tasted anything worse"
436,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,in my life. I don’t see how in the world people can get fond of such
437,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,stuff.”
438,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
439,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“That’s just it,” said the teacher; “they should do as your little deer"
440,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"did this afternoon, and never meddle with a drink that tastes very"
441,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"bad the first time they try it, unless they should be sick and need a"
442,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,bitter medicine for particular purposes. If a healthy person should
443,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,try to drink big glasses full of ugly medicine just for fun every day
444,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"he would soon be sick, and few medicines taste as bad as some of the"
445,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,drinks so many people get drunk on.”
446,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
447,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Cod-liver oil doesn’t, nor herb tea,” said Tommy. “I tried them, and"
448,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,know they are not half as ugly as beer. And they say beer isn’t the
449,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"worst yet,” he added; “there are drinks that taste like burning fire,"
450,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,if you get a drop on your tongue. I don’t see how in the world anybody
451,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,can get fond of such stuff.”
452,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
453,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Let me tell you,” said the teacher. “The first time they try it"
454,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"they cannot help disliking it, and they should take the hint to let"
455,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,it alone altogether. But if they keep drinking it in spite of their
456,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"horror, it will lead to a very strange result. Their nature gradually"
457,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"gets changed, till a time comes when they cannot do without a drink"
458,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,that made them shudder when they tasted it first. It is that way with
459,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"beer and brandy, and even with a drink made of that very wormwood"
460,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,that would have made your deer sick if it had eaten it. Just rub one
461,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"of those leaves between your fingers, and then put the tip of your"
462,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,finger to your tongue. That is just exactly the taste of a stuff called
463,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"absinthe, and brandy and strong beer are almost as bad.”"
464,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
465,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“You say people get fond of it if they drink it again and again,” mused"
466,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"Tommy, “but what makes them do that, I wonder? What makes them try it"
467,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,at all?”
468,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
469,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“They see other people do it,” said the teacher, “and so they try it"
470,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"themselves, and keep on trying, because they think Mr. So-and-so ought"
471,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"to know better than nature. Their own nature warns them against it,"
472,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"but they do not mind that warning, and keep on till it is too late"
473,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,to turn back. Now you might ask me to tell you who first took it in
474,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,his head to make himself sick with such a foolish habit. That seems a
475,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"puzzle, indeed, but it has been explained in this way. Before people"
476,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"drank wine they drank the fresh juice of grapes—‘must,’ as they call"
477,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,it—and probably tried to keep some of it in bottles and jars. Now in
478,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,warm weather sweet juices of that sort are very apt to spoil—they
479,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"ferment, as it is called, and their pleasant taste becomes sharp and"
480,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,disagreeable. Some stingy housekeeper in old times may have forced his
481,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"servants to drink that spoiled stuff rather than throw it away, and"
482,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"after a while they got fond of it, and the foolish habit spread all"
483,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,over the country. Now wine is nothing but fermented or spoiled must.
484,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"Beer is fermented barley water. They let barley get soaked in water,"
485,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,and then mix it and stir till it gets that sharp taste that made you
486,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,sick when you tried it by mistake in that summer hotel last year.”
487,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
488,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“Yes; and on that same trip I once got in the wrong railway car,” said"
489,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"Tommy, “and that car was full of tobacco smoke enough to make my"
490,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"little brother cry, and I thought it would choke me before the train"
491,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,stopped and we got back in the right car. I know a boy who got so sick
492,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,he had to go to bed when he first tried to smoke; but I am sure I shall
493,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,never try it at all.”
494,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
495,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,[Illustration: SHE’S SUCH A DARLING!]
496,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
497,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“That’s right, Tommy; let such things alone altogether,” said the"
498,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"teacher. “It’s very easy never to begin, but if you should get fond of"
499,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,such bad habits you might find it hard to get rid of them.”
500,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
501,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“I have a book about travels,” said Tommy, “and I read that the"
502,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,American Indians first taught white men to smoke. One of my cousins has
503,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"been in Mexico, and when I asked him what made the Indians so fond of"
504,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"tobacco smoke, he said they first used it to drive mosquitoes out of"
505,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"their cabins. They burn tobacco leaves on a hot pan, and the gnats all"
506,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,fly out of the window.”
507,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,
508,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,"“I should not wonder,” laughed the teacher; “and that would show that"
509,HOW THE DEER KNEW.,mosquitoes have more sense than those Indians.”

517,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
518,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
519,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,I GET the idea and most of the details from Harper’s Bazar. The article
520,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"from which they are taken says the contrivance is for an invalid, but"
521,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"let me assure you that mamma will like it very much, or, for the matter"
522,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"of that, papa also, though they have not thought of being invalids."
523,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
524,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"First, contrive to get a nice pine board about twenty-five inches"
525,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,long and twenty-one wide (if you are making it for me I should like
526,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"the board a little narrower, but perhaps mamma might not); cover it"
527,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,with felt of any color you please—perhaps it would be well to have
528,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"in mind the furniture in the room where it is chiefly to live, and"
529,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"secure a color which will harmonize, or at least not “fight,” with the"
530,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,prevailing color there.
531,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
532,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"Perhaps, however, you will be in the condition in which I have"
533,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"sometimes found myself; namely, with a piece of felt of a certain"
534,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"color which obstinately refuses to turn into another, no matter how"
535,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"much I might desire it; in that case, if I were you I would go right"
536,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"ahead with my present; I feel sure mamma will find it useful, even"
537,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,though it is not just the shade which you and she like best. The same
538,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"remarks will apply to material. I have used cretonne, or even calico,"
539,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"where I would have preferred felt if I could have got it. Well, we"
540,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,will pretend to cover this pine board with felt; we will have the felt
541,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,so long and wide that it will reach say for six inches or so below
542,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"the board at both ends, and on the front side. Then make neat little"
543,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"pockets for these ends and side, with a flap to button down over them"
544,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"when desired. These are to hold letters, envelopes, bits of poetry,"
545,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"scraps of prose, recipes, in fact anything which mamma desires to have"
546,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,convenient when she sits down to write. If mamma uses a fountain pen
547,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"I think she will like exceedingly a little narrow pocket, just wide"
548,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"enough for her pen to slip in easily, and just deep enough for it to"
549,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,stand upright and put its head out for her to get hold of. If she does
550,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"not, a “traveler’s inkstand,” leather covered, may be glued at the"
551,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"right end of the board; it has a “spring” cover, you will remember,"
552,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,and takes faithful care of the ink when closed. A stamp box of wood or
553,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,paper may be glued at the other end.
554,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
555,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,What a delightful present that will be when you get it done! I am
556,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,sure “mamma” will appreciate and enjoy it. The Bazar says a row of
557,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"brass-headed nails should be driven all around the edges of the board,"
558,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,I suppose to hold the felt firmly in place; but a little girl who had
559,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,no brass nails could very easily sew her felt or cretonne or calico
560,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"around the under side of the board, and make her pockets separately,"
561,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"sewing them firmly to their places, if she wished."
562,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
563,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"In fact, there is room in this device for many changes and"
564,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,improvements. I can imagine an ingenious girl or boy—or perhaps it
565,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"would be better to say girl and boy—putting their heads together, and"
566,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,making many variations which would be a comfort to the fortunate owner.
567,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"Try it, and let me know the result."

577,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
578,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
579,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"IT was very early in the morning; earlier, in fact, than Nannie was"
580,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"in the habit of being up; but on account of Thanksgiving Day, and the"
581,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"fact that they were all going, to Aunt Cornelia’s to dinner, Nannie"
582,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,thought she ought to be on hand early. She was waiting for mamma to
583,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"give her her bath, and sat down to pet Rosamond Catherine Lorinda in"
584,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"the meantime. The middle name, Catherine, was in honor of Grandma"
585,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Patterson, but Nannie did not like it very well, and felt obliged to"
586,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"place it between two names which she called “delicious,” in order to"
587,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,tolerate it. A bright thought occurred to her; she might dress the
588,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,child for the Thanksgiving dinner while she waited. It was while she
589,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,struggled with the sleeve which did not want to go on that the thought
590,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,came which caused all her trouble.
591,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
592,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"“This sleeve is too small,” she said; “I b’lieve my child’s arm must"
593,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,have grown a great deal since she wore this dress before; she ought to
594,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,have had a new dress for Thanksgiving; she would look sweet in a white
595,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,embroidered one trimmed with lace.” Just then the baby in the willow
596,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"cradle at her side nestled in his sleep, and Nannie turned and looked"
597,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,at him.
598,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
599,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,“If Rosamond Catherine Lorinda only had one dress like what Teddy has
600,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"so many of, I should be too perfectly happy,” she said. “Just think, I"
601,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,b’lieve he has as many as ’leven or eight! Mamma might borrow me one
602,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"just for to-day; it would be too long, but I could cut it off at the"
603,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,bottom; it would be just as easy to sew it on again when Teddy needed
604,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"it; and the sleeves I could loop up with pink ribbons, and she would"
605,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,look too perfectly sweet!”
606,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
607,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"The more she thought about it, the more the longing grew; at last it"
608,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,began to seem a positive injustice that Teddy should have so many
609,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,clothes and not be willing to lend any to Rosamond Catherine Lorinda.
610,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"“I know he would, if he understood,” said Nannie, looking approvingly"
611,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"upon the sleeping baby; “he loves my Rosamond, and kisses her just as"
612,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,cunning! And he has such a perfectly lovely lot of dresses! I just
613,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"mean to look in the bruro drawer and count them.” Saying which, she"
614,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"tiptoed toward the bureau behind the cradle, and opened the second"
615,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"drawer. To be sure she was barefooted, and could not have made much"
616,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"noise; besides, if she was doing right why should she care if her"
617,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"footsteps were heard? Nevertheless, she instinctively tiptoed along,"
618,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,and opened the drawer as softly as she could; and it was not for fear
619,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"of waking Teddy, either."
620,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
621,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,There lay the dresses in a fluffy white heap; on the top was the one
622,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,which Nannie most coveted.
623,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
624,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"“Teddy hardly ever wears it,” she said reassuringly, as she drew it"
625,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,out; “I guess mamma doesn’t like it very much or she would put it on
626,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,him oftener; and Rosamond Catherine will look too perfectly sweet for
627,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,anything in it. I am most sure mamma would not care. I could cut it off
628,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"right through all those little embroidery holes, then Grandma could sew"
629,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,them together again just as easy.”
630,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
631,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,I grieve to tell you that she did exactly that dreadful thing. Not
632,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"immediately; she resolved to try the dress on first, and see if it"
633,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"would do; and despite the fact that the waist was many times too large,"
634,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"and the limp arms were altogether lost in the sleeves, the waxen-haired"
635,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"beauty looked so enchanting to her mother’s eyes, under those billows"
636,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"of white, that in a very short space of time the shining shears were"
637,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"making a long, crooked line through the costly embroidery with which"
638,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,Teddy’s best dress was trimmed.
639,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
640,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"O, me! the troubles which in this way were stored up for naughty,"
641,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,foolish Nannie. They began almost immediately; for despite the fact
642,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,that Nannie had coaxed herself into the fancy that there was no harm
643,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"in what she did, she found she was not willing to have her mother"
644,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"know about it, and crumpled the elegant dress into a small bundle and"
645,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,thrust it under the great rug at her feet when she heard her mother’s
646,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"footsteps. All through the breakfast hour, and even at family worship,"
647,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,she was engaged in planning how she should get Rosamond Catherine
648,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,Lorinda dressed and wrapped in her traveling cloak without any one
649,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"having seen her; for fond as she was of exhibiting the beauty, she"
650,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,found that to-day she would rather her charms were hidden from all eyes.
651,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
652,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,She was still planning ways and means when the discovery came. She was
653,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"not prepared for it, because when Teddy had so many dresses, how could"
654,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,she suppose that when her mother opened the drawer to select one she
655,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"would exclaim, “Why, what has become of his dress? I laid it on top so"
656,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,as to get it without disturbing the others.”
657,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
658,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,A good deal of talk followed. Papa suggested that she had laid it in
659,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"some other drawer, and Aunt Laura said perhaps Grandma had taken it to"
660,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"set a stitch in; and Grandma affirmed that she had not, and asked what"
661,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Nannie was longing to: “Why don’t you take one of the others, daughter,"
662,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,and get the little fellow ready while he is good-natured?”
663,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
664,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"“Well, but where can it be?” asked the puzzled mother, closing the"
665,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"drawer. “I am sure I laid it here, on the top. I wanted Adelaide to see"
666,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"him in that dress, because she sent me the embroidery for it, you know,"
667,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,and it is more expensive than any I should have bought.”
668,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
669,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,Nannie caught her breath nervously over this; she had not supposed the
670,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,embroidery was so choice; she might just as well have taken one of the
671,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,other dresses if she had only known.

673,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Just at that moment Susan, who was bustling about, packing Teddy’s"
674,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"traveling bag, stooped down and pulled at something white under the"
675,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"rug, as she said, “Shall I put in some playthings, Mrs. Walters? Why,"
676,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,what’s this?”
677,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
678,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"What was it, sure enough, but the lost dress cut in two, in a fearful"
679,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"zigzag manner, directly through the costly embroidery! Can you imagine"
680,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"what followed? I am sure you will not be surprised to learn that poor,"
681,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,naughty little Nannie had a whipping then and there. Her mother did
682,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"not even wait for Susan to leave the room, as she generally did before"
683,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,punishing any of her children. It is true the whipping was not very
684,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"severe, for Mrs. Walters was never severe; but the disgrace of it was"
685,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"terrible, for Nannie was very rarely whipped."
686,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
687,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"However, this was by no means the worst of her troubles; behold, mamma"
688,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"declared that she could not go to the Thanksgiving dinner, but must"
689,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,stay at home with Susan and the cat. Now when you reflect that they
690,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,were to ride four miles in a beautiful sleigh drawn by two prancing
691,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"horses, and meet a baker’s dozen of little cousins, some of whom Nannie"
692,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"had never seen, to say nothing of the delights of the Thanksgiving"
693,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"dinner, and the little pies with their names on, done in sugar plums,"
694,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"which were to be ready for each cousin, I am sure you will feel with"
695,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Nannie that her punishment was greater than she could bear. In truth,"
696,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"the others thought so. Papa said, “My dear, couldn’t you reconsider,"
697,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"somehow?” Aunt Laura said, “Jennie, I think you are horrid!” And even"
698,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Susan ventured to say, “I don’t think she knew it was his best dress,"
699,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"ma’am; and she says Grandma can sew it together, poor little heart.”"
700,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,But Mrs. Walters was very firm. She did not deign to answer Laura
701,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"or Susan, but said to her husband, “Richard, I don’t know how I can"
702,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"change, now. I said she couldn’t, and you know I ought to keep my word."
703,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Besides, the child needs a serious lesson; it is quite as hard for me,"
704,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"I think, as for her,” and the mother’s lip quivered a little. Then the"
705,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"father said soothingly, that of course he knew she was doing it for"
706,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Nannie’s best good, and he could trust her judgment where he couldn’t"
707,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"his own. But Aunt Laura remained indignant, and the whole household was"
708,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"in trouble. “Our Thanksgiving is spoiled,” said Aunt Laura; “I’ve a"
709,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,good mind not to go.”
710,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
711,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Meantime, Grandma said not a word. It was nearly an hour afterwards,"
712,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"and the preparations for starting, which had gone on much more"
713,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"silently, were almost completed, when Grandma opened the door of Mrs."
714,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Walters’ room, dressed in her best black silk, with her beautiful white"
715,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"satin hair peeping out from under the soft laces of her best cap, and"
716,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"holding by the hand a little girl with very red eyes, and a red nose,"
717,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"who kept up a suspicious little sniffing, as though it was only by"
718,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,great effort she refrained from bursting into fresh tears. Grandma
719,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"walked straight toward her daughter, and said, “Mamma, we have come to"
720,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"ask you if you will not forgive poor little Nannie, who is very sorry,"
721,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"and let her go to-day, for Grandma’s sake—not for hers at all, but for"
722,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,Grandma’s.”
723,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
724,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"And the handsome mother, with a sudden glad light flashing in her gray"
725,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"eyes, stooped and kissed the cheek of her sweet old mother, and then of"
726,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"her own little daughter, as she said, “Dear mother, you know what you"
727,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,ask for your own sake I could certainly never refuse.”
728,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,
729,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"The years have rolled on since then, enough of them to make little"
730,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"Nannie twenty-six, and the mother of one Rosamond, who has golden hair"
731,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"like the dollie, her namesake, but who is mischievous, as Rosamond of"
732,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"old never was. And I heard the sweet mother say, last Thanksgiving"
733,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"morning, after having told this story of her past for the benefit of"
734,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"some young mothers, “I am thankful for two things: that I had a mother"
735,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"who taught me that wrong-doing must bring unhappiness, not only to"
736,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"myself, but to others; and that I had a dear Grandmother who taught me"
737,NANNIE’S THANKSGIVING.,"what it was to have a powerful friend to come between me and Justice,"

889,LORA’S SERMON.,
890,LORA’S SERMON.,
891,LORA’S SERMON.,"IT was Sunday morning, and all the family except Lora and her mother"
892,LORA’S SERMON.,"had gone to church. As a rule they, or at least Lora, were the first to"
893,LORA’S SERMON.,be tucked into the sleigh; but on this particular morning Mrs. Wheeler
894,LORA’S SERMON.,"had said she was not going; that she had a little cold, she believed,"
895,LORA’S SERMON.,"and was “all tuckered out” with the week’s work, and just in condition"
896,LORA’S SERMON.,to get more cold very easily; and Lora’s coat did look too ridiculous
897,LORA’S SERMON.,"to wear to church, so she had better stay at home with her."
898,LORA’S SERMON.,
899,LORA’S SERMON.,"“By next Sunday you will have your new coat,” she said, to console the"
900,LORA’S SERMON.,"child, “and be all in order for church for the rest of the winter.”"
901,LORA’S SERMON.,
902,LORA’S SERMON.,Lora looked sober for a few minutes; she was very fond of riding to
903,LORA’S SERMON.,"church tucked in among the great soft robes, and she did not mind the"
904,LORA’S SERMON.,"service so very much, though the sermon was pretty long. However, she"
905,LORA’S SERMON.,"was naturally a sunny little girl, and her face soon cleared as she"
906,LORA’S SERMON.,"buttoned her somewhat shabby coat, and went out to watch the snowbirds,"
907,LORA’S SERMON.,who were gathering in great numbers near the barn doors.
908,LORA’S SERMON.,
909,LORA’S SERMON.,Lora and the snowbirds were friends; indeed she made friends with all
910,LORA’S SERMON.,"sorts of dumb animals, and had queer little ideas about them."
911,LORA’S SERMON.,
912,LORA’S SERMON.,"“You will fall,” she said gravely, addressing a fat bird who swung on"
913,LORA’S SERMON.,a tiny branch almost at her side; “you have picked out a very slimsy
914,LORA’S SERMON.,branch; it looks as though it was almost broked off; maybe it will
915,LORA’S SERMON.,break while you are swinging on it—I most know it will—then you will
916,LORA’S SERMON.,"fall down in the snow and hurt yourself. I falled off of a limb once,"
917,LORA’S SERMON.,and it hurted.”
918,LORA’S SERMON.,
919,LORA’S SERMON.,"The bird paid not the slightest attention to this friendly warning, but"
920,LORA’S SERMON.,"Lora continued to stand still, looking at the swaying bush, her face"
921,LORA’S SERMON.,"full of earnest thought. She had already turned from the bird, and was"
922,LORA’S SERMON.,thinking about the verse sister Nannie had taught her that morning. It
923,LORA’S SERMON.,"was a long verse for a little girl, with some hard words in it; but"
924,LORA’S SERMON.,"Lora had mastered them, and said them over in her mind, revolving,"
925,LORA’S SERMON.,"meanwhile, the explanation which Nannie had made of them. “If a man"
926,LORA’S SERMON.,"abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered.”"
927,LORA’S SERMON.,"“Branches do wivver as soon as they are broked off,” said Lora. “I’ve"
928,LORA’S SERMON.,seen them; and papa and Moses burn them up—that is what it said.
929,LORA’S SERMON.,
930,LORA’S SERMON.,"“This stick is broked off,” she continued, carefully examining the one"
931,LORA’S SERMON.,"which she grasped with both chubby hands; “it used to grow, but it"
932,LORA’S SERMON.,"won’t ever any more. All the leaves have wivvered off it, and some day"
933,LORA’S SERMON.,"it will get burned up, I s’pose; it isn’t good for much.”"
934,LORA’S SERMON.,
935,LORA’S SERMON.,"Words stopped just here, but that little Lora’s brain went on with the"
936,LORA’S SERMON.,"great thoughts which she could not express, was evident from the look"
937,LORA’S SERMON.,on her face. The Bible verse and Nannie’s careful explanation of it had
938,LORA’S SERMON.,taken deep root in her heart. She went into the house presently; the
939,LORA’S SERMON.,thoughts had grown so large that she felt as though she must ask some
940,LORA’S SERMON.,more questions.
941,LORA’S SERMON.,
942,LORA’S SERMON.,"As a usual thing, Sunday quiet reigned in Mrs. Wheeler’s kitchen at"
943,LORA’S SERMON.,"this hour of the day. But this day was an exception. Mrs. Wheeler,"
944,LORA’S SERMON.,bustling about doing up the last things connected with the morning
945,LORA’S SERMON.,"work, had come across a bowl of mince meat and a lump of dough"
946,LORA’S SERMON.,"evidently left from pie crust. “I declare for it!” she exclaimed, “I"
947,LORA’S SERMON.,"thought Kate made up all the pies yesterday. What a careless thing, to"
948,LORA’S SERMON.,leave this bowl of mince meat here over Sunday! It would make two good
949,LORA’S SERMON.,"pies, and if all the folks come for Thanksgiving we may fall short;"
950,LORA’S SERMON.,they set such store by my pies. I wonder what Kate was about? It must
951,LORA’S SERMON.,have got dark before she finished. These must be made up the first
952,LORA’S SERMON.,"thing to-morrow—but there is pretty near everything to do to-morrow,"
953,LORA’S SERMON.,too; it makes a great deal of work getting ready for such a house full;
954,LORA’S SERMON.,"and pie crust is none the better for standing, either; I declare,"
955,LORA’S SERMON.,I’ve a mind to slap this on to a couple of tins and set them in the
956,LORA’S SERMON.,"oven; there is fire enough to bake them nicely, and it won’t take five"
957,LORA’S SERMON.,"minutes, hardly, and there are so many ways to turn to-morrow.”"
958,LORA’S SERMON.,
959,LORA’S SERMON.,"There were more thoughts about it not put into words, but it ended in"
960,LORA’S SERMON.,"the moulding board being spread out on the table, and the flour jar"
961,LORA’S SERMON.,and rolling-pin and pastry knife being laid beside it. I wonder they
962,LORA’S SERMON.,"did not all blush for shame, for such a thing had never happened to"
963,LORA’S SERMON.,"them before on a Sabbath. Mrs. Wheeler’s cheeks were rather red, and"
964,LORA’S SERMON.,she felt what she would have called “kind of queer”; but she flew about
965,LORA’S SERMON.,"very fast, and meant to be soon seated in the best room in her Sunday"
966,LORA’S SERMON.,dress.
967,LORA’S SERMON.,
968,LORA’S SERMON.,It was just at that moment that Lora pushed open the kitchen door and
969,LORA’S SERMON.,"entered, her eyes large with the thoughts about which she wanted to"
970,LORA’S SERMON.,question. They grew larger as she took in the situation. Her mother
971,LORA’S SERMON.,rolling out pie crust! And it was Sunday! Such a thing had never
972,LORA’S SERMON.,happened in Lora’s experience. Nobody knows why the queer little brain
973,LORA’S SERMON.,"put together the thoughts which had come to her outside, and the pie"
974,LORA’S SERMON.,"crust in the kitchen; but it did, and there came, presently, this"
975,LORA’S SERMON.,"question: “Did you get broked off, muvver?”"
976,LORA’S SERMON.,
977,LORA’S SERMON.,"“Did I what?” said Mrs. Wheeler, her cheeks very red. There was"
978,LORA’S SERMON.,something in Lora’s look and tone which made them redder.
979,LORA’S SERMON.,
980,LORA’S SERMON.,“Get broked off. That is what Nannie said. She said folks that got
981,LORA’S SERMON.,broked off did things that Jesus did not want done; and kept doing
982,LORA’S SERMON.,"them. Does he want you to make pies to-day, muvver?”"
983,LORA’S SERMON.,
984,LORA’S SERMON.,"“If I ever saw such a child!” said Mrs. Wheeler, making the rolling-pin"
985,LORA’S SERMON.,revolve over the board at railroad speed. “What does Nannie mean
986,LORA’S SERMON.,"putting such notions into your head? Go into the other room, child, and"
987,LORA’S SERMON.,take off your coat; I’ll be there in a few minutes. I’m not going to
988,LORA’S SERMON.,make pies; I shall wad up this dough and keep it until to-morrow.”

1016,THAT RAINY DAY.,"wiped a tear away, he, too, thought she would be a nice teacher, and"
1017,THAT RAINY DAY.,must have a good heart to be so willing to help his motherless ones.
1018,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1019,THAT RAINY DAY.,There are a great many things I would like to tell you about this
1020,THAT RAINY DAY.,"little family and their splendid teacher, but all I will have time for"
1021,THAT RAINY DAY.,"now, is the story of one rainy day, and what they did about it."
1022,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1023,THAT RAINY DAY.,The storm was so hard they could none of them venture out; certainly
1024,THAT RAINY DAY.,"little Gretchen must not be taken out, so there seemed a prospect for a"
1025,THAT RAINY DAY.,"dull, dreary, lonesome day."
1026,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1027,THAT RAINY DAY.,"The few dishes were soon put away, and all were hungry for school."
1028,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1029,THAT RAINY DAY.,"“I know what to do,” said Pauline; “let’s play school. We can read and"
1030,THAT RAINY DAY.,"spell and make numbers, and maybe we can study geography a little; then"
1031,THAT RAINY DAY.,when we go to school to-morrow teacher will be so s’prised to see how
1032,THAT RAINY DAY.,"much we have learned; and then she’ll smile, and maybe she will kiss"
1033,THAT RAINY DAY.,"us, every one! Won’t that be fun?”"
1034,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1035,THAT RAINY DAY.,"She didn’t try to rhyme, but in her eagerness it came of itself."
1036,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1037,THAT RAINY DAY.,"So they had school, and Metza played teacher, and Pauline sat by little"
1038,THAT RAINY DAY.,"Gretchen, and Fritz and Mary sat with them on the long lounge, and they"
1039,THAT RAINY DAY.,"had such a nice time they forgot that it was storming outside, and were"
1040,THAT RAINY DAY.,"much astonished when at noon papa came home to lunch, and so sorry they"
1041,THAT RAINY DAY.,had forgotten to heat the water for his coffee.
1042,THAT RAINY DAY.,
1043,THAT RAINY DAY.,"But when they told him what a nice time they had had, he smiled, and"
1044,THAT RAINY DAY.,"said, “My Pauline has been a good mother to-day.” And she thought, “I"
1045,THAT RAINY DAY.,have the best papa in the world.”

1086,I.,I.
1087,I.,
1088,I.,IT was the dawn of a winter morning. Ding-dong-ding clanged the
1089,I.,"chapel bell. I sprang up and began to dress, while Marta went to the"
1090,I.,"mission-house for a cup of coffee. As I fastened the last button, there"
1091,I.,"was a rap at the door. “Come,” I called, and in walked the dear little"
1092,I.,"maid with a cup of coffee carefully covered to keep in the steam, and a"
1093,I.,"roll done up in a napkin, which the cook had insisted upon her bringing."
1094,I.,
1095,I.,"Ding-dong began the bell again. “Tell the girls not to wait for me,” I"
1096,I.,said; and soon the clatter of many feet on the stairs indicated their
1097,I.,"departure. The coffee must be swallowed, and the little roll must not"
1098,I.,"be wholly neglected; then putting on bonnet and ulster, I started to"
1099,I.,"follow. Fido, our little spaniel, was standing disconsolate in the"
1100,I.,"hall below. Her eyes were full of entreaty, and wagging her tail"
1101,I.,"persuasively, she accompanied me to the door."
1102,I.,
1103,I.,"“Go back, Fido. Can’t take little dogs to church!” I exclaimed. She"
1104,I.,"knew it was no use to tease, and stood watching me as I opened the"
1105,I.,"heavy door with difficulty, and slammed it after me—it would not latch"
1106,I.,"unless slammed. As I reached the church door, I heard the organ—that"
1107,I.,"meant the service had begun, and I was late! something I never meant"
1108,I.,"to be, but this was so early to go to church! The Armenians are all"
1109,I.,"accustomed in the Gregorian Church to a service even earlier, and when"
1110,I.,"they become Protestant, or Evangelical, they still cling to the old way"
1111,I.,"of making worship the first thing in the morning, and giving breakfast"
1112,I.,the second place.
1113,I.,
1114,I.,"Instead, then, of going up the men’s aisle, and sitting at the further"
1115,I.,"end where we missionaries usually do, I went on to the door at the"
1116,I.,left—the women’s—and slipped into a back seat. A little girl just in
1117,I.,"front of me passed me her hymn book, so that I could join with the"
1118,I.,"congregation in singing “_Garode yem, voh garode yem_”—“I need Thee,"
1119,I.,"O, I need Thee.” Just as the hymn closed, the sun’s rays struck the"
1120,I.,eastern window and streamed in; then the preacher arose and read the
1121,I.,"epistle to Philemon, and also 1 Cor. vii. 22. . . ."
1122,I.,
1123,I.,"The benediction was pronounced, and the congregation slowly streamed"
1124,I.,"out. The walk from the chapel to the street is narrow, and as it is"
1125,I.,"not proper for women to crowd in among the men, we waited till they"
1126,I.,"had mostly passed on. While standing outside, Shushan, one of our day"
1127,I.,"pupils, came along with her mother; both were completely enveloped"
1128,I.,in the white crapy wrap which is worn by the Armenian women in this
1129,I.,"section. Shushan’s bright-colored dress showed through, and at the same"
1130,I.,time set off the figure in the wrap.
1131,I.,
1132,I.,"“_Par-ee loo-is_, Shushan; are you of the same mind as yesterday about"
1133,I.,going to Kozloo?”
1134,I.,
1135,I.,"She returned my good-morning, and said she was; yes, indeed!"
1136,I.,
1137,I.,“Why should we change our minds?” said her mother. “Are we not also
1138,I.,Christ’s servants?” referring to the sermon we had just heard.
1139,I.,
1140,I.,"You see, Shushan’s brother was bitterly opposed to her going away"
1141,I.,"to teach, and I thought it quite possible that he had influenced her"
1142,I.,to give it up. It was years after girls’ schools were opened before
1143,I.,people were willing to send their children to a woman teacher—I mean a
1144,I.,native—still worse if she was “only a girl.” They would far rather send
1145,I.,"them to a man, however ignorant and incapable. That long struggle has"
1146,I.,"ended at last in victory, and we have no more trouble in finding work"
1147,I.,for our girls; but we have another difficulty now. Well-to-do parents
1148,I.,and brothers consider it a disgrace—at least many of them do—to have
1149,I.,their daughters and sisters work as though they were obliged to earn
1150,I.,their support.
1151,I.,
1152,I.,"“Haven’t you food and clothes?” they ask indignantly, when a girl,"
1153,I.,"filled with a desire to do something for her people, intimates a"
1154,I.,purpose to teach. Perhaps I may as well complete this little tale here
1155,I.,"and now, although it does not belong to the incident of the Sabbath I"
1156,I.,have been describing.
1157,I.,
1158,I.,"A few days later the (native) pastor came to me and asked anxiously,"
1159,I.,"“Can’t you persuade Shushan, for the sake of peace, to give up going to"
1160,I.,"Kozloo? Her brother is very violent, and talks terribly, declaring that"
1161,I.,"even if she were mounted, and going through the most public street, he"
1162,I.,would drag her off the horse; if she should by any chance succeed in
1163,I.,"carrying out her plan, she should never come home again—he would never"
1164,I.,again acknowledge her as his sister.” The pastor went on to say that he
1165,I.,thought the brother had offered to send her away to school if she would
1166,I.,"give up “this crazy scheme,” as he called it."
1167,I.,
1168,I.,"I sent for Shushan, and finding that her brother had made the offer"
1169,I.,"referred to, advised her to accept it. The sacrifice of her will for"
1170,I.,"the sake of avoiding scandal, would, I was sure, be as acceptable"
1171,I.,to the Master as the service she had intended. In less than a week
1172,I.,"thereafter, she was on her way to a distant school."
1173,I.,
1174,I.,"We passed out through the arched gateway, and then parted with a mutual"
1175,I.,“_yer-tak par-rov_”—“good-by.” How the sun sparkled on the snowy
1176,I.,"street, on the mountains which seemed to stand across it, so near they"
1177,I.,"looked, and reared their dazzling summits into the brilliant blue of"
1178,I.,the winter sky.
1179,I.,
1180,I.,"The girls with their shawls modestly over their heads, crossed the"
1181,I.,street in a straggling little procession. Fido appeared in the window
1182,I.,which she had pried open with her little black nose—windows are hung
1183,I.,"like doors—gave an eager and joyful bark or two, and rushed down to"
1184,I.,welcome them home. Then they sat down to their breakfast of tea and
1185,I.,bread. The former was seasoned with white lump sugar (brown sugar is
1186,I.,"unknown), but there was no butter for the bread."
1187,I.,
1188,I.,"I doubt whether my readers would have recognized the thin, whity-brown"
1189,I.,"sheets, or the rags placed before one of the girls who had elected"
1190,I.,"to take the pieces, as bread, but so it was. They have many kinds in"
1191,I.,"Turkey, and this thin kind, a little thicker than blotting-paper, is"
1192,I.,very popular here. In the autumn it is a very common thing for a girl
1193,I.,"to come and say, “Teacher, mother says will you please excuse me from"
1194,I.,"school to-day?” And she explains that they are baking bread, and need"
1195,I.,her help.
1196,I.,
1197,I.,“But why doesn’t your mother get some woman to help her?”
1198,I.,
1199,I.,Then I find that it is a regular “bee”—a bread bee! The neighbors are
1200,I.,"already there, and they will work all night—it is no small job to roll"
1201,I.,it out so thin. There will be no more baking till the worst of the
1202,I.,"winter is over. It is stacked away in a dry place, and when wanted the"
1203,I.,"requisite number of sheets (about two feet long by one wide) is taken,"
1204,I.,"sprinkled as you would clothes for ironing, and after a few moments,"
1205,I.,"folded once lengthwise and laid around the edge of the table. If,"
1206,I.,"instead of being sprinkled, the bread is held over the fire a moment,"
1207,I.,it becomes crisp and really nice; but this is seldom done.
1208,I.,
1209,I.,"After the housework was done we had prayers, and then the girls were"
1210,I.,"dismissed with a charge not to hang about the halls or stairways,"
1211,I.,"as the boys were coming over again to sing, and to keep their doors"
1212,I.,"closed. “Not ajar as last Sunday, to my mortification and your"
1213,I.,disgrace; most likely the boys thought you left them open on purpose so
1214,I.,that they could look in.” Somehow the boys and girls are wonderfully
1215,I.,interesting to each other all the world over.
1216,I.,
1217,I.,"Soon the young fellows filed in, looking half-pleased, half-shy—big,"
1218,I.,"six-foot Isaac, and clever little Bo-ghos; Sumpad, with his bright,"
1219,I.,"frank smile; poor, awkward Deekran, the best writer in school, and"
1220,I.,his brother Arsen. We practiced “Hold the Fort”; there were two bad
1221,I.,mistakes with which we struggled for a while. Then we sang “What a
1222,I.,"Friend we have in Jesus,” “Sweet By and by,” “Almost Persuaded,” “Go"
1223,I.,"Bury thy Sorrow,” “The Ninety and Nine,” and others—all in Armenian, of"
1224,I.,course.
1225,I.,
1226,I.,Then I said just a word to Deekran about money I entrusted to
1227,I.,him—merely a caution to be careful to return any money that might
1228,I.,"be left over. It was hardly the thing for the Sabbath, but I was"
1229,I.,"not likely to see him for some days, and I wanted to prevent any"
1230,I.,carelessness—it is so important for boys that they learn to be careful
1231,I.,and business-like.

1251,THE HARD TEXT.,
1252,THE HARD TEXT.,But there is a sin against the Holy Ghost so great that it cannot be

1381,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“Mamma, what am I going to do to make somebody happy to-morrow? What"
1382,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,can little girls do?”
1383,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1384,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“You can be just as sweet as a rose all day, and obey mamma as soon as"
1385,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"she speaks. That will make me very happy,” said mamma."
1386,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1387,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,“But I want to give something to somebody to s’prise ’em and make ’em
1388,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"glad,” Lucy said."
1389,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1390,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,“Who is there that you would like to surprise?” her mamma asked.
1391,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1392,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"Lucy thought a minute, then she said:"
1393,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1394,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,“Mrs. Bly.”
1395,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1396,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"Mrs. Bly lived in the “Home for Aged Women.” She was a nice old lady,"
1397,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,and Lucy often went with her mother to call upon her.
1398,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1399,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“Very well, dear,” said mamma; “there is your gold dollar; if you want"
1400,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,to give it you may.”
1401,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1402,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“May I buy ’zactly what I please, mamma?”"
1403,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1404,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“Yes, dear.”"
1405,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1406,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“O, how nice!” said Lucy. “Can’t we go now, right off, to buy it?”"
1407,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1408,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"Mamma said “Yes” again, and Lucy ran off to get her hood and cloak and"
1409,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"mittens. In a few minutes she was out on the street with mamma, gazing"
1410,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,into all the shop windows. “What shall I buy? What shall I buy?” she
1411,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,kept asking.
1412,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1413,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"Mamma said a little shawl for Mrs. Bly’s shoulders would be nice, or a"
1414,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,pair of warm stockings or some handkerchiefs. But Lucy shook her head.
1415,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1416,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,“Wouldn’t she like a bu’ful dollie or a sweet little kitty better?” she
1417,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,asked.
1418,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1419,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,Mamma had to laugh at that.
1420,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1421,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"Just then Lucy cried out, “There it is! I see it! That is what I want.”"
1422,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1423,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,Guess what it was.
1424,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1425,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,[Illustration: WHAT THEY NEED.]
1426,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1427,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,It was a beautiful large rosebush in a pretty pot. There were two roses
1428,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,on it and plenty of buds.
1429,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1430,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,So they went in and bought it. The man said he would send it up right
1431,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,away.
1432,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1433,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,Old Mrs. Bly was sitting in her rocking-chair knitting. There came a
1434,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"knock at the door. She opened it, and who should be there but Lucy and"
1435,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"her mamma, and a boy with a rosebush!"
1436,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1437,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"How surprised Mrs. Bly was, and how pleased, when she knew that little"
1438,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,Lucy bought the plant with her own money.
1439,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1440,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"“You dear little lamb,” she said; “it will make me very happy. It is"
1441,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,like the roses in my old home.”
1442,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1443,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,When Christmas morning came Mrs. Bly cut off one of those lovely roses
1444,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,and put it in a vase. She carried it to a poor old lady across the hall
1445,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"who was ill in bed, and it made her glad."
1446,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,
1447,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,So you see little Lucy made three people happy that Christmas day—the
1448,A HAPPY CHRISTMAS.,"sick old lady, Mrs. Bly and herself."

1480,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,A LONG CHRISTMAS.
1481,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1482,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1483,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"THERE had been the usual Christmas-tree, which the cousins from three"
1484,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,homes had gathered to enjoy. There had not been a Christmas since the
1485,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,oldest of them could remember—and he was sixteen—that the cousins had
1486,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"not been together in one of the homes, and had a frolic around the"
1487,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas-tree. It was always hung with bright-colored balls, and"
1488,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"strings of popcorn, and all the bright and pretty and useless things"
1489,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,which people from year to year have contrived for such trees. It always
1490,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"had clustered about it the various sorts of fruits which refused,"
1491,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"because of their weight, to be hung upon the branches—dolls, and kites,"
1492,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"and wagons, and swords, and books and baskets. Every year the fruit"
1493,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"grew stranger in some respects, with a dreary sameness in others, which"
1494,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,was actually beginning to weary the hearts of the cousins.
1495,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1496,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,The first excitement was over. The fathers and mothers and maiden
1497,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"aunts, together with three grandmothers and two grandfathers, had"
1498,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"retired to quieter parts of the house, and the young people were left"
1499,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"to their enjoyment. It was not very noisy in the room, nor were most of"
1500,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,the cousins absorbed in their gifts; in fact their faces were already
1501,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"sobering. Little Nell was still happy over her new building-blocks,"
1502,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"and Dell, her other self, was trying to advise her concerning them,"
1503,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"while Harold tried his new paints and brushes on the chair he occupied,"
1504,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"his guardian sister leaning over the back of the chair, so absorbed"
1505,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,the while in her own grave thoughts that she did not even notice the
1506,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,mischief he was doing.
1507,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1508,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“It is all over once more,” said Holly. He was the sixteen-year-old"
1509,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"cousin, and he thrust his hands in his pockets, and said it with a yawn."
1510,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1511,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Some of it is a good deal of a bore,” answered Tom, the cousin next"
1512,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"in age, echoing the yawn. “I didn’t get the first thing I expected or"
1513,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,wanted.”
1514,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1515,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Neither did I; but then I don’t know what I wanted, I am sure, unless"
1516,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"it was a bicycle, and you can’t put that on a Christmas-tree very"
1517,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,well.”
1518,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1519,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Why not, as well as the trumpery which is put on?” asked Tom"
1520,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,contemptuously. “I tell you the whole thing is getting to be a bore.
1521,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Even the small fry don’t care for it half so much as they think they
1522,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"do; there’s Nannie sulking this minute because her dollie, which she"
1523,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"has deserted, is not so nice according to her notion as Lily’s is. And"
1524,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Ted has turned his back on the whole of it because he didn’t get a
1525,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,drum. This crowd needs something new.”
1526,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1527,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“I don’t know what it would be; we have had everything imaginable, and"
1528,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,if the simple truth were told need presents less than any young folks
1529,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"in the kingdom, I do suppose. My father says there is nothing new to"
1530,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,get for pampered young people like us; and I don’t know but he is about
1531,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,right.”
1532,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1533,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“There’s a whole lot of money spent about it every year, though.”"
1534,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"This was from Hortense, the oldest of the girl cousins, and a sort of"
1535,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,adviser of the two older boys.
1536,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1537,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“I know it,” said Holly; “and a good deal of it is wasted. Nannie, for"
1538,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"instance, did not need another doll any more than the cat needs two"
1539,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"tails, and as for me I have seven jack-knives now.”"
1540,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1541,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,At that moment Helen turned away from the paint brush which she had not
1542,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"noticed, and joined in the conversation."
1543,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1544,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Isn’t it funny? I have five new balls, and I don’t care for any of"
1545,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,them. They keep giving us the same things over and over.”
1546,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1547,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“They forget,” said Holly; “and there is nothing new for them to get"
1548,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"us, anyhow.”"
1549,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1550,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“I know something that would be new.” It was Hortense again, speaking"
1551,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,with grave thoughtfulness. The boys turned and looked at her
1552,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,inquiringly. “Don’t you know what Mr. Briggs told about the children
1553,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"out in the Colorado mountains, who never had a Christmas present in"
1554,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"their lives, and didn’t know anything about such times as we have? I"
1555,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,was thinking what if we could make up a box and put into it all the
1556,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"dollies, and balls, and jack-knives, and things that we don’t want, and"
1557,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"some books, and perhaps a little candy, and send it out there, wouldn’t"
1558,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,it be nice?”
1559,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1560,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,[Illustration: THEIR FACES WERE ALREADY SOBERING.]
1561,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1562,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Too late for this year,” said Tom promptly."
1563,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1564,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Why, no, it isn’t; if we hadn’t had any Christmas at all, ever, we"
1565,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,would be willing to have one come to us in January.”
1566,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1567,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"The boys laughed, and Holly said heartily, “That’s so.” And Hortense"
1568,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"began to tell a story that she had heard Mr. Briggs tell to her uncle,"
1569,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"and the younger ones gathered about her, leaving dolls and paints, and"
1570,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,the interest grew.
1571,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1572,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,It was the very next day that Hortense and Tom and Holly went to Dr.
1573,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Parsons’ house to see Mr. Briggs.
1574,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1575,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“Why, yes,” he said, looking perfectly delighted with them, when Holly"
1576,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"explained; “let me tell you about a brave little chap out there, only"
1577,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,eleven years old; his father was guide to the tourists who wanted to
1578,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"climb the dangerous and difficult mountains, and lost his life from"
1579,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"exposure, hunting a party of men who had strayed away. Little Teddy"
1580,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"is as brave as a soldier. He is a guide himself, though so young, and"
1581,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"getting to be one of the surest and safest to be found in that region,"
1582,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"only he is so young and small yet, that strangers are afraid to trust"
1583,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,him. A dreary life Teddy leads; he and his mother live all alone in a
1584,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,little house at the foot of a mountain. The boy has only the clothes
1585,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"which his father left, made over for him the best way his mother can."
1586,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,He never had anything that fitted him; and he never had any playthings
1587,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"in his life, only what he picked up; as for knives, or balls, or any"
1588,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"of the things which boys like him enjoy, I don’t know what he would"
1589,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,think if one should happen to come to him. You needn’t suppose that
1590,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,he hasn’t heard all about Christmas; his mother used to live in a
1591,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"farmhouse in New York State, and the stories she has told have almost"
1592,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,driven him wild. A few rods away from their cottage lives a family with
1593,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"five children—three little girls, and a four-year-old boy and a baby. I"
1594,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,happen to know that Teddy set his heart this year on having some sort
1595,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,of a Christmas present for every one of those children—and failed! I
1596,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"did not mean that he should, but I was sick at just the wrong time"
1597,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"after I reached home, and my plans did not work. I heard from there"
1598,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"only last night, and poor Teddy’s plans did not work, either.”"
1599,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1600,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Holly had his note book and pencil in hand. “Will you give us his full
1601,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,name and address?” he said.
1602,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1603,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Such a time as the cousins had packing that box! Every baby of them
1604,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"contributed, not only the toys which they did not want, but a few that"
1605,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"they loved, and parted from with sighs. The same may be said of the"
1606,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"elder cousins, especially when it came to books; Holly was a miser"
1607,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"where these were concerned, and Hortense knew how to sympathize with"
1608,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,him. It took these two several hours to be willing to pack in that box
1609,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"some of their handsomely bound volumes, written by favorite authors."
1610,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1611,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"But they had to go; for Mr. Briggs, among other things, had said, “I"
1612,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,never saw a boy so hungry for reading in my life as Teddy; and he has
1613,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"only scraps of old newspapers, which he has picked up from time to time"
1614,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,among the tourists.”
1615,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1616,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,And more than books and toys went into that box.
1617,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1618,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,“It is a shame for a fellow to have no clothes that fit him!” declared
1619,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"Tom. “I’ve been there myself, and I know how it feels. I had to wear my"
1620,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"brother Dick’s overcoat once, and it was too large for me. Mr. Briggs"
1621,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"says he is about the size of Roger”—he meant Teddy, and not Mr. Briggs."
1622,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,“We must ask mother about that.”
1623,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1624,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"They asked her to such purpose, and Aunt Cornelia as well, that two"
1625,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,neat suits of Roger’s and Cousin Harry’s second best clothes went into
1626,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,the box.
1627,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1628,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,The day in which it was finally packed was a jubilee. The cousins were
1629,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"all invited to Aunt Cornelia’s to supper, and packed the box in the"
1630,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"large dining-room after supper, with a little of Aunt Cornelia’s and"
1631,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,Uncle Roger’s help.
1632,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1633,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"“I don’t know as I ever had so much fun in my life,” said Holly,"
1634,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,looking up from the driving of the last nail to make the remark. “It
1635,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,is better than Christmas a dozen times; in fact it is a Christmas
1636,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,extension.”
1637,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1638,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,“And won’t it be fun to hear from Teddy?” said Hortense.
1639,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,
1640,A LONG CHRISTMAS.,"But as for us, we cannot expect to hear from Teddy until January."

1761,I.,
1762,I.,EDWARD STEADMAN was at home for the Christmas holidays. Everybody
1763,I.,"was glad to see him, of course, particularly his mother; because in"
1764,I.,the first place mothers always are a little bit more glad over the
1765,I.,"home-coming of their boys than anybody else in the world can be, and"
1766,I.,"secondly because she needed some help very much, and knew that he"
1767,I.,could give it. She explained matters to him that morning: “I want to
1768,I.,"get Grandma’s room all in order, Edward, and her new carpet down, and"
1769,I.,"every thing, before Christmas, you know; and we shall have to work"
1770,I.,"like bees. I’m so glad you came home this week, instead of stopping at"
1771,I.,"your uncle’s first. To-day we can hang all her pictures, and put up"
1772,I.,"the curtains and the wall-pockets, and do things of that kind; they"
1773,I.,"will not make a speck of dust in putting down the carpet—it is new,"
1774,I.,"you know. I want to get all those things done to-day, they are so"
1775,I.,puttering—take a great deal of time and judgment. I’m so glad to have
1776,I.,you to depend upon; you are such a tall boy that you can reach where
1777,I.,mother can’t; and Dick is so clumsy I hate to have him stumping about
1778,I.,"Grandma’s room. Your father was going to help me, though he did not"
1779,I.,know how to spare the time; he was as pleased as could be when I told
1780,I.,him that you could do it all. ‘Sure enough!’ he said; ‘we have got a
1781,I.,boy to depend upon once more; how good it seems!’”
1782,I.,
1783,I.,"The sentence closed with a fond smile, and such a look in the mother’s"
1784,I.,eyes as ought to have made a boy happy. Edward was happy; he whistled
1785,I.,"as he went down the stairs, and thought to himself that there were not"
1786,I.,"many fellows who had such a mother as his, and that he would show her"
1787,I.,"just how tall, and how handy and how wise he was."
1788,I.,
1789,I.,She called after him as she heard the street door open.
1790,I.,
1791,I.,"“Where are you going, Edward? We ought to get right to work; it will be"
1792,I.,"an all-day job, do the best we can, and the light is good in Grandma’s"
1793,I.,room now for hanging the pictures. Must you go to the post-office
1794,I.,"first? O, well! that is but a short distance; run along, and get back"
1795,I.,as soon as you can.”
1796,I.,
1797,I.,"“Halloo!” said Mr. Arkwright, the postmaster, who had known Edward"
1798,I.,"ever since he was a little fellow in kilts and curls, “back again, are"
1799,I.,"you? How you do shoot up, to be sure! I believe you are about a foot"
1800,I.,taller than you were in the fall. Here’s your mail; nothing but papers
1801,I.,"this time, but enough of them to snow you under!” And he pitched them"
1802,I.,through the little window so fast that they fell to the right and left.
1803,I.,
1804,I.,"“Catalogues, some of them,” said Edward, smiling; “I asked them to send"
1805,I.,me a number of the new ones; and the reports of our commencement and
1806,I.,society exercises are in these papers.”
1807,I.,
1808,I.,"“Like enough,” said Mr. Arkwright; “had a grand time, I suppose? You"
1809,I.,"carried off a first prize, I hear? Glad of it. I always knew it was in"
1810,I.,"you. Do you happen to be going directly home? If you are, would you"
1811,I.,mind taking this letter and handing it in at Westlake’s as you pass? I
1812,I.,"see it is marked ‘Important,’ and it may save him some trouble to get"
1813,I.,it right away. He’s all alone in the office to-day; his boy is sick.”
1814,I.,
1815,I.,"“Certainly, sir,” said Edward, reaching for the letter, and dropping it"
1816,I.,"into his jacket pocket. Then he walked away, looking steadily at one of"
1817,I.,"the papers, which he had already opened."
1818,I.,
1819,I.,“I do not see what in the world can have detained Edward!” said Mrs.
1820,I.,"Steadman, speaking as well as she could with her mouth full of tacks."
1821,I.,"She was mounted on a box which in its turn was mounted on a chair, and"
1822,I.,was trying to reach to fasten the curtain in Grandma’s room.
1823,I.,
1824,I.,"“I should think you would wait for him,” said her daughter Fannie"
1825,I.,"anxiously. “You ought not to climb up like that, mother; father would"
1826,I.,"not like it at all, and I’m afraid you will fall. You are not high"
1827,I.,enough yet to get it right.”
1828,I.,
1829,I.,"“I know it; and I can’t drive a nail away up here, either. I cannot"
1830,I.,understand why Edward doesn’t come; it seems as though something must
1831,I.,have happened to him. I explained to him particularly what a hurry we
1832,I.,"were in, and how much there was in which he could help me.”"
1833,I.,
1834,I.,"[Illustration: “CERTAINLY, SIR,” SAID EDWARD.]"
1835,I.,
1836,I.,"“What has happened to him is that he has found something to read, I"
1837,I.,"suppose, and has seated himself somewhere to enjoy it.” Fannie spoke a"
1838,I.,"little irritably; she was worried about her mother, and they had been"
1839,I.,waiting for Edward for more than two hours. The short December day was
1840,I.,"hurrying toward its noon, and nothing had been done of the many things"
1841,I.,in which he was to have been a central figure. Fannie was very fond of
1842,I.,"her brother, but she realized his besetments better than the others"
1843,I.,"did, or at least she said more about them."
1844,I.,
1845,I.,"“O, no!” said the mother decidedly, taking a tack out of her mouth to"
1846,I.,"enable her to speak plainly; “Edward wouldn’t do that, after all I said"
1847,I.,to him this morning. He knew how anxious we were to have everything
1848,I.,"ready for Grandma by Christmas. Something unusual has happened, I feel"
1849,I.,sure. I don’t know but Tommy would better run out and see if he can
1850,I.,"find him, only it seems rather absurd to be sending out in search of a"
1851,I.,big boy like Edward.”
1852,I.,
1853,I.,"“I should think so!” Fannie said, and they waited another half-hour."
1854,I.,Then a sharp ring at the door-bell startled Mrs. Steadman so that she
1855,I.,"nearly lost her balance. Fannie screamed a little, and ran toward her."
1856,I.,
1857,I.,"“I didn’t fall,” she said, leaning against the window-casing for"
1858,I.,support; “but I think I shall have to get down. I don’t see what makes
1859,I.,me so nervous. It seems all the time as though something was going to
1860,I.,happen; I suppose it is because Edward doesn’t come. Did Jane go to the
1861,I.,door?”
1862,I.,
1863,I.,"Yes, Jane had; and now they listened and heard Mr. Westlake’s, their"
1864,I.,"neighbor’s, voice."
1865,I.,
1866,I.,“Is Edward here?”
1867,I.,
1868,I.,"No, Jane said, somewhat shortly, he was not; and as to where he was,"
1869,I.,that was more than they knew. Jane had been called from her work three
1870,I.,"times that morning to help with something which Edward could have done,"
1871,I.,and she did not feel sweet-natured.
1872,I.,
1873,I.,"“Well, I wish you would ask your folks if they have any idea where I"
1874,I.,"might find him,” Mr. Westlake said anxiously; “I have just come from"
1875,I.,the office—it was the first chance I had for going this morning—and
1876,I.,Arkwright says he sent a letter to me marked ‘Important’—sent it by
1877,I.,"Edward nearly three hours ago, he should think. I have some business"
1878,I.,"matters that are very important, and I thought this might be a summons"
1879,I.,"to me to go away on the express, and there is but a half-hour or less"
1880,I.,before it goes.”
1881,I.,
1882,I.,Before this long sentence was finished Mrs. Steadman was at the door;
1883,I.,"but she had no information to give, and could only tell the annoyed man"
1884,I.,"that she was sorry, and that she could not imagine what had detained"
1885,I.,Edward.
1886,I.,
1887,I.,"“I can,” muttered Jane, as he turned hurriedly away; “his own sweet"
1888,I.,"notion is detaining him; he’s enjoying himself somewhere, readin’ a"
1889,I.,"book or paper, and letting others get along the best way they can.” But"
1890,I.,Jane was only talking to herself.
1891,I.,
1892,I.,"The Steadman dinner bell was sounding through the house when Edward,"
1893,I.,"flushed and embarrassed, came bounding up the stairs two steps at a"
1894,I.,"time, to assure his mother how sorry he was."
1895,I.,
1896,I.,"“I hadn’t the least idea how time was going,” he explained; “never"
1897,I.,was so astonished in my life as I was to hear the bell ring for noon!
1898,I.,"Why, you see,” in answer to her anxious questions, “I got a lot of"
1899,I.,"papers at the office—all about our closing days, you know; of course I"
1900,I.,"was anxious to see what they said about the examinations, and essays,"
1901,I.,"and things, so I stepped into Dr. Mason’s office just to glance them"
1902,I.,"over. The doctor was out, and I sat and read first one thing and then"
1903,I.,"another, and talked a little with folks who kept coming in search of"
1904,I.,"the doctor, until, to my utter astonishment, as I tell you, I heard the"
1905,I.,bell.”
1906,I.,
1907,I.,"“Then nothing detained you, Edward?”"
1908,I.,
1909,I.,"“Why, no, ma’am; nothing but the papers, as I tell you. I had not the"
1910,I.,faintest idea”—
1911,I.,
1912,I.,She interrupted him. “Have you seen Mr. Westlake?”
1913,I.,
1914,I.,"“Yes’m,” and now Edward’s face crimsoned; “I met him on the street and"
1915,I.,gave him his letter. I’m dreadfully sorry about that; almost as sorry
1916,I.,"as I am about keeping you waiting, mother.”"
1917,I.,
1918,I.,“He said it might want him to take the train; do you know if it did?”
1919,I.,
1920,I.,"“Yes’m, it did.”"
1921,I.,
1922,I.,“And he missed it?”
1923,I.,
1924,I.,"“Why, of course, mother dear; the train goes at eleven, you know. I’m"
1925,I.,awfully sorry. It is perfectly unaccountable what has become of this
1926,I.,forenoon!”
1927,I.,
1928,I.,Mrs. Steadman made no comment; she did not want to trust herself to do
1929,I.,so just then. She turned away with a sigh so deep that it would have
1930,I.,"cut Edward’s heart, had he heard it."
1931,I.,
1932,I.,"And Jane nodded her gray head and muttered, “I told you so!”"

1940,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1941,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1942,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,ADELE CHESTER had never spent a Christmas in the country before;
1943,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,neither had she ever felt quite so desolate. Mother and father were in
1944,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Europe, in search of health for the father, and Adele, who had been"
1945,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"left in charge of Aunt Martha, had herself decreed that she would go"
1946,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,nowhere for Christmas.
1947,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1948,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“I can’t be happy and frolic when papa is sick,” she said; “and as for"
1949,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"the country, if Aunt Martha can live there all her life, I think I can"
1950,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,endure one Christmas.” So she had staid; but it must be confessed that
1951,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"the world looked dreary to her that wintry morning, with nothing but"
1952,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,snow to be seen from her window. She almost thought she would have been
1953,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,wiser to have joined the Philadelphia cousins. “At least there would
1954,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"have been a chance to spend my Christmas money,” she murmured gloomily,"
1955,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,as she tapped on the frosty window pane with restless fingers. “I’m
1956,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,sure I don’t know what I can buy in this little tucked-up place.”
1957,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1958,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,The “tucked-up place” was really a nice town with about five thousand
1959,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"people living in it, but to Adele, whose home was in New York City,"
1960,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,it seemed absurd to call it a town. Aunt Martha’s farmhouse was only
1961,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"half a mile from some very good stores, where Adele had found a few"
1962,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"things to suit her during the three months she had spent there, and on"
1963,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,the whole she had managed to be quite happy. But she did not feel like
1964,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,being suited with anything this morning. Such a queer Christmas for
1965,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"her! She had had her presents, as usual—a new fur cap from Aunt Martha,"
1966,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"a writing-desk well furnished from Uncle Peter, a lovely ring with a"
1967,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"real diamond in it from mamma, and a new chain for her pretty watch"
1968,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"from papa. What more could a reasonable girl want? Truth to tell, she"
1969,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"wanted nothing but the dear home, and mamma’s kisses, and papa’s arms"
1970,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"around her. The ring and chain were beautiful, but they did not seem"
1971,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"like presents from them, when she knew they crossed the ocean weeks"
1972,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"ago, and had been lying in Aunt Martha’s bureau drawer waiting for this"
1973,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,morning. She valued the letter more which had arrived only the night
1974,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"before, and she drew it from her pocket and kissed it, letting a tear"
1975,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"or two fall on the words, “My Darling Child,” as she read them once"
1976,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"more. “Papa and I are so sorry to be away from you to-day,” the letter"
1977,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,read; “we have tried to find something suitable to send on so long a
1978,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"journey, and planned to reach you on the very day, but have failed;"
1979,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"papa has not been well enough to look about much for a few weeks, and"
1980,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,I could not go alone. At last we decided to send you a fifty-dollar
1981,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,bank note and bid you go and spend it in the way which would make you
1982,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,happiest.”
1983,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1984,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“The idea!” said Adele, smiling through her tears, as she refolded"
1985,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"the letter, “just as though I could find anything here to buy to make"
1986,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,me happy! Mamma must have forgotten for the moment where I was. Yet I
1987,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"want a few things, some Christmas bonbons, at least, if they know the"
1988,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"meaning of the word in this little place, and above all, I want a brisk"
1989,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"walk in the snow. I shall take ten dollars of my fifty, and go out and"
1990,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,spend it; I won’t waste another cent on this old town. I wonder what I
1991,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,can do with ten dollars to make me happy?” She laughed half scornfully.
1992,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Ten dollars seemed so very little to this girl, who had always spent"
1993,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"money as freely as water, and done as little thinking about it as the"
1994,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,birds do over the spring cherries.
1995,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
1996,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,In a very few minutes she was wrapped in furs and out upon the snowy
1997,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"road. Aunt Martha offered her the sleigh and the driver, and her"
1998,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“leggings” and woollen mittens, but she would have none of them. She"
1999,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"was a good walker, and had been used to miles in the city. She hid her"
2000,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"nose in her muff, because the wind over this wide stretch of snow was"
2001,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"very keen, and sped along “like a snowbird,” Aunt Martha said, watching"
2002,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"her from the window. And then she sighed, this dear old auntie whom the"
2003,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,country satisfied. She saw the shade on the face of her darling this
2004,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"morning, and was sorry for her, and wished so much that she could do"
2005,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,something to brighten her Christmas day.
2006,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2007,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"The little town was reached in due time, and the streets were gay with"
2008,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas finery; the stores were open quite generally, to catch the"
2009,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,belated Christmas buyers. In an hour or two they would close for the
2010,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,day; but the custom in this thriving manufacturing town was to give
2011,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,the tardy ones a Christmas morning chance. Adele went from one store
2012,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"to another, dissatisfied, disconsolate. Nothing suited her. The truth"
2013,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"is, when a girl does not need an earthly thing, and is yet determined"
2014,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"to spend some money, she is sometimes rather difficult to suit. She"
2015,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,halted at last before a show window and looked at the bright fineries
2016,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"displayed there. So did little Janey Hooper, who had come out with ten"
2017,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"cents to buy a soup bone for the day’s dinner. Adele, turning from the"
2018,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"window, jostled against her, and looked down upon the mite. She seemed"
2019,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"not more than eight, yet there was a wise, grown-up look in her eyes"
2020,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,which held the homesick girl’s attention.
2021,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2022,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,“Are you trying to make Christmas too? What do you see in the window
2023,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,you like?”
2024,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2025,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Everything,” said the little girl simply."
2026,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2027,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,“Do you? you are fortunate. Are you going to buy them all?”
2028,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2029,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“O, no! not a single one. I couldn’t.”"
2030,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2031,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Adele, looking closely at her, was seized with a sudden impulse."
2032,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Suppose you could buy one thing, what would it be?” she asked."
2033,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2034,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,The little girl’s eyes flashed. “Oh! I would buy that shawl—that soft
2035,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,gray one with pussy fringe—it looks just like mother.”
2036,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2037,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"It was a dingy little shoulder shawl, of the kind which can be bought"
2038,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,for two dollars. “Does your mother need a shawl?” asked Adele.
2039,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2040,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“O, yes’m! she needs it badly enough; but we are not going to get one,"
2041,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,not this year; we can’t.”
2042,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2043,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"There was decision and composure in the tone, like a woman who had"
2044,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"settled the whole question, and put it beyond the range of argument."
2045,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,Her manner amused Adele.
2046,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2047,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“That was for your mother,” she said; “what would you choose for"
2048,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,yourself?”
2049,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2050,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Me?” said the child, surprised. “Oh! I don’t know. I might take that"
2051,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"brown coat, maybe, or some mittens, or—I don’t know which I would take."
2052,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,What’s the use?”
2053,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2054,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,She was turning away; but Adele’s gloved hand detained her. The little
2055,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,sack she wore was much too thin for so cold a morning.
2056,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2057,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Wait a minute,” she said gently. “Tell me what your name is, won’t"
2058,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"you, and where you live, and what you came out for this cold morning"
2059,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,with so thin a sack?”
2060,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2061,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,“I’m Janey Hooper; we live down there on Factory Lane. It wasn’t far to
2062,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"go, and my sack is worn out, that is why it is so thin; but it will do"
2063,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,very well for this winter. I came out to buy the Christmas dinner.”
2064,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2065,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Did you, indeed! Aren’t you very young to go to market?”"
2066,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2067,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“O, no, ma’am! I’m turned nine, and the oldest of four, and father’s"
2068,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,dead. Of course I have to do all I can. I know how to choose a lovely
2069,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,soup bone.”
2070,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2071,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,“Do you? Are you going to have soup to-day?”
2072,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2073,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Yes’m, a big kettle full; I’ve got ten cents to buy a bone with. I"
2074,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,generally get a five-cent one; but we thought for Christmas we would
2075,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"have it fine. My brother is to be home to dinner; he is most twelve,"
2076,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,and likes soup.”
2077,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2078,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,There was a mist before Adele’s eyes that the frosty air did not make.
2079,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,She brushed it away and settled her plans.
2080,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2081,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Come in here with me a minute,” she said; “I want your help about"
2082,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"something.” The child followed her wonderingly, with eyes that grew"
2083,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"every moment larger, as the thick brown coat which hung on a wire"
2084,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,figure was taken down and deliberately tried by the smiling shop girl
2085,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,on her quaint little self.
2086,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2087,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“It fits to a T,” said the girl; “Janey has a pretty figure, and that"
2088,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,just suits her.”
2089,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2090,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“It is warm, at least,” said Adele. “Did you say it was two and a"
2091,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"half? What an absurd price! Keep it on, child; it is for you. This is"
2092,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Christmas, you know, and Santa Claus sent it to you. Now that shoulder"
2093,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,shawl.”
2094,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2095,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"A moment more, and it was in Janey’s astonished arms. Her eyes"
2096,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"sparkled, but she made an earnest protest: “Oh! if you please, I don’t"
2097,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,think I can; I am afraid mother would not”—
2098,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2099,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Your mother cannot help herself,” interrupted Adele. “Don’t you know I"
2100,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"told you it was Santa Claus? He does what he likes always. Come along,"
2101,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,I’m going to market with you; I want to see you pick out a soup bone.
2102,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,Is it to go in that basket?”
2103,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2104,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"She picked it out with grave care and with skill, Adele and the market"
2105,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"man watching her the while. “Isn’t it a nice one, Bobby?” said the"
2106,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"child, to a stout boy who had also stopped. Adele turned as the"
2107,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,freckled boy nodded.
2108,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2109,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Who is this? Is he a friend of yours? Well, Bobby, Santa Claus wants"
2110,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"you to do an errand for him, will you? He will give you four of those"
2111,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,red-cheeked apples if you will.”
2112,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2113,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"The boy laughed good-naturedly, and said he didn’t know much about"
2114,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Santa Claus, but he would do whatever she wanted done."
2115,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2116,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Very well,” said Adele merrily; “I want that market basket which hangs"
2117,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,up there. Can you lend it to this boy for a little while?” The market
2118,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"man declared his entire willingness to do so, and kept Janey Hooper"
2119,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,waiting for her bone while he filled that basket with everything which
2120,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Adele’s eyes could discover, which might add to a Christmas dinner."
2121,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"There was a plump chicken, a roast of beef, a string of sausage, some"
2122,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"potatoes, apples, onions, turnips, a great bunch of celery, and, in"
2123,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"short, whatever the market man suggested, after the girl’s skill was"
2124,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,exhausted.
2125,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2126,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,“Is that too heavy for you?” said Adele.
2127,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2128,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“O, no, ma’am!” Bobby assured her."
2129,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2130,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“Very well; I want you to take it to this little girl’s mother’s house,"
2131,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"and tell her Santa Claus sent it to go with the soup, and that it has"
2132,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,given him a happy Christmas to do so. Will you remember?”
2133,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2134,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"He nodded brightly, stuffing rosy-cheeked apples into his pocket the"
2135,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"while, and they trudged away, Janey trying to murmur her bewildered"
2136,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"protests, while Adele paid her bill."
2137,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2138,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"“I’ve spent every cent of my ten dollars,” she told Aunt Martha an hour"
2139,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,later. “I hadn’t even enough to buy you any Christmas bonbons; but
2140,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,I have obeyed mamma’s directions; I was to buy something to make me
2141,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"happy, and I haven’t felt so happy in weeks as I do this minute. When I"
2142,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,get my things put away I’ll come down and tell you all about it.”
2143,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2144,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"Aunt Martha watched her bound up the stairs, a glow on her cheeks and"
2145,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,a sparkle in her eyes which they had lacked when she went out; and
2146,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"whatever the purchase had been, she was grateful."
2147,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,
2148,A TEN-DOLLAR CHRISTMAS.,"As for Janey Hooper and her mother, to say nothing of Bobby, who took"

2158,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.
2159,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2160,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2161,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"THERE were thirteen of them, all told. An “unlucky number,” one of"
2162,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"them said, and laughed; they were girls who did not believe in “luck.”"
2163,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"They laughed a great deal during these days, and were very happy. They"
2164,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"had as lovely a secret on their minds as thirteen girls, all of them"
2165,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"between the ages of eleven and thirteen, ever had. They were also very"
2166,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"busy, and held many committee meetings, and discussed plans, and went"
2167,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,in companies of twos and threes to transact business. “We were never so
2168,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"busy before at this time of year, were we?” they said to one another."
2169,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,“And we never had so much fun in our lives!” some one would be sure to
2170,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,say. To this sentiment they all agreed.
2171,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2172,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,“This time of year” was a few days before Christmas. The preparations
2173,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"for Christmas, so far as these girls are concerned, began two weeks"
2174,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,before. It started on Sunday afternoon in the Bible class. Miss Parker
2175,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,had been even more interesting than usual that day. She succeeded in so
2176,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"filling their hearts with the lesson, especially with one thought in"
2177,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"it, that Cora Henderson said, half enviously:"
2178,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2179,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“O, dear! I can’t help wishing that we had lived in those times. Of"
2180,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"course it was dreadful; but then, after all, it gave one such splendid"
2181,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,opportunities! Think of John having a chance to take Jesus’ mother home
2182,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"and do for her. And to know that Jesus wanted him to, and was pleased"
2183,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,with it! I think it would have been just lovely; there are no such
2184,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"chances nowadays,” and Cora, aged thirteen, sighed."
2185,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2186,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Miss Parker smiled on her brightly. “Are you sure of that, my dear"
2187,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,girl? Remember we are talking about a history which is different from
2188,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"any other in the world, because Jesus is ‘the same yesterday, to-day"
2189,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,and forever.’”
2190,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2191,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“O, yes’m!” Cora said civilly; “I know it; but then, of course, things"
2192,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,are different. His mother is not here on earth for us to take care of;
2193,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"I should love to do it, I know I should,” and Cora’s fair face glowed,"
2194,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,and her eyes had a sweet and tender light in them.
2195,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2196,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Miss Parker looked at her fondly. “My dear child,” she said, “I think"
2197,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"you would; but do you forget how He said, ‘Whosoever shall do the will"
2198,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and"
2199,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,mother’?”
2200,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2201,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Cora looked a little bewildered, and Miss Parker explained."
2202,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2203,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,“I think we all forget that according to that verse Jesus has many
2204,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"‘mothers’ on earth, in the persons of his dear old saints, who are"
2205,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"poor, and weak, and tired, and are only waiting to be called home."
2206,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"There are so many things we could do for their comfort, if we only"
2207,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,remembered that they were the same to Jesus as his own dear mother.”
2208,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2209,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,The girls looked at one another wonderingly. This was a new way of
2210,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,putting it. Cora did more than look. “What a lovely thought!” she
2211,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"said; “I should never have thought it out for myself, but it must be"
2212,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"so, because what would that verse mean if it were not? O, Miss Parker!"
2213,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,couldn’t we girls do it? Do you know of any old lady whom we could help
2214,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"a little—make a pretty Christmas for, perhaps? Girls, wouldn’t you all"
2215,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,like to do it?”
2216,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2217,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"So that was the beginning. Yes, Miss Parker knew an old lady; had had"
2218,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,her in mind all the week; had wondered how she could set to work to
2219,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"interest her dear girls in her. She needed a great deal of help, and"
2220,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Miss Parker had very little of this world’s goods. She knew that some
2221,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,of her girls came from homes where there was plenty. “But I do not like
2222,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"to be always begging,” she told her mother. Then she had asked the Lord"
2223,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Jesus to show her some way of interesting the girls in poor Grandmother
2224,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Blakslee. And here they were asking for the name of an old lady whom
2225,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,they could help! What a lovely answer it was to her prayer.
2226,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2227,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,[Illustration: “NOW LET US ASK A BLESSING.”]
2228,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2229,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Grandmother Blakslee’s story was a sad one, though only too common."
2230,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Her two daughters and her one son had died long years before, leaving"
2231,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"a little granddaughter, who had grown to girlhood and married a"
2232,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"worthless drunkard, who deserted her, and at last she died, leaving to"
2233,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Grandmother Blakslee the care of her poor little baby boy. In many ways
2234,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"life had gone hard with Grandmother Blakslee; and now in her old age,"
2235,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"when she was too feeble to work, the thing which she had dreaded most"
2236,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"in the world, next to sin, had come to her door. She could no longer"
2237,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"pay the rent for her one little bare room, and must send her little boy"
2238,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"to the orphan asylum, and go herself to the poorhouse. It seemed a very"
2239,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,pitiful thing to Grandmother Blakslee that she should have had to plan
2240,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"to leave the bare little room on Christmas morning, but that happened"
2241,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,to be the day when it was convenient for the man who had promised to
2242,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,take her and her old arm-chair. Poor little Johnnie was to go with
2243,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"her for that one day, and the next morning he was to be taken in the"
2244,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,market wagon to the asylum. Poor Grandmother Blakslee! her heart was
2245,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"very sad and sore, but she tried to keep her face quiet and peaceful"
2246,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,for Johnnie’s sake. She had not been able to make the little fellow
2247,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,understand that he was to be separated from her; the most he realized
2248,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,was that they were to take a ride together and spend the day in a big
2249,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"house, and he was happy. On the little three-cornered table was set a"
2250,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"dish with baked potatoes and warm rolls, and the teapot stood near it;"
2251,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,a neighbor only a little less poor than themselves had remembered them.
2252,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Grandmother tried to have only thankfulness in her heart; but could she
2253,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"forget that she had lived in that town more than sixty years, and been"
2254,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,a member of the church all that time? Occasionally she could not help
2255,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,feeling it was strange that there could have been no other way but to
2256,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"go to the poorhouse. “It won’t be long now for me,” she told herself,"
2257,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“and I should like to have kept Johnnie while I staid, poor little"
2258,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"boy! But it was not to be.” Then she smothered a sigh and said, “Come,"
2259,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Johnnie, let us ask a blessing, then we will have our last breakfast"
2260,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,alone together.”
2261,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2262,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"It was while Johnnie stood with clasped hands, saying after Grandmother"
2263,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the words of blessing, that a knock was heard at the little door. “Come"
2264,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"in,” said Grandmother Blakslee the moment the words of prayer were"
2265,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"spoken, and a strange head was thrust in at the door."
2266,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2267,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“I can wait, ma’am,” said the owner of it respectfully. “I’m to take"
2268,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"you in my rig, and my orders were to wait until you were ready.”"
2269,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2270,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“Did Mr. Patterson send you?” asked Grandma, her voice all in a"
2271,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"tremble. “I thought he meant to come himself, and I thought he said"
2272,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"about ten o’clock; but we’ll hurry, Johnnie and me; we won’t keep you"
2273,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"long. Can you take the chair, too?”"
2274,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2275,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“Yes’m; them’s my orders; and no hurry in life, ma’am, take your time,”"
2276,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,and he closed the door.
2277,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2278,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Johnnie stuffed in the buns and potatoes, and pronounced them good; but"
2279,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,poor Grandmother Blakslee only swallowed a few mouthfuls of tea which
2280,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,almost choked her. Life was very hard.
2281,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2282,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,She was soon ready; it would not do to keep Mr. Patterson’s team
2283,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,waiting. But she stared at it when she came out. It was not the market
2284,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"wagon; instead it was a handsome two-horse sleigh, with gay robes’ on"
2285,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the seats, and gay bells on the handsome horses. “You needn’t be at"
2286,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"all afraid, ma’am,” said the strange man, “these horses is gentle as"
2287,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"kittens, if they do love to go,” and he lifted her in as though she had"
2288,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"been a kitten, tucked Johnnie under the robes beside her, and before"
2289,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,she could get her breath to speak they were off. Just a gay dash around
2290,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the corner, down one familiar street, up another, and they halted"
2291,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,before a tiny white house set back among tall trees which staid green
2292,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,even in winter.
2293,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2294,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“There is some mistake,” faltered Grandma Blakslee, more breathless"
2295,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,than ever. “I wasn’t to be brought here; I was to go to the asylum out
2296,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"on the Corning Road, near two miles; I don’t know the folks that live"
2297,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,here; I didn’t know it was rented.”
2298,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2299,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"The strange man chuckled. “I guess there’s no mistake,” he said, “and"
2300,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"you’ll like to make their acquaintance; anyhow, I must do my duty and"
2301,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,leave you here; I’m under orders.”
2302,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2303,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Trembling and bewildered, poor Grandma, because she did not know what"
2304,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"else to do, let herself be set down in front of the door, which the"
2305,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"man opened hospitably, saying as he did so, “Step right in; the folks"
2306,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,that live here will be glad to see you.” Then he shut the door and went
2307,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"away. They were left, Grandmother and Johnnie, in a little hall opening"
2308,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"into a pretty room at the right. The door was wide open, and a bright"
2309,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,fire burned in a shining stove. There was a bright carpet on the floor;
2310,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"there was a rose in blossom in one window, and some geraniums in the"
2311,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"other. There was a large easy chair in front of the stove, with a table"
2312,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,beside it on which was set out a lovely breakfast for two. On the stove
2313,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the tea-kettle sang, and some genuine tea in a little brown teapot on"
2314,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the right-hand corner back, sent out its delicious aroma. In an alcove,"
2315,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"behind some pretty curtains which were partly drawn, waited a plump"
2316,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,white bed; and Grandma Blakslee stood in the midst of all this luxury
2317,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,and stared.
2318,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2319,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"“Grandma,” said Johnnie, “have we got there? Is this the big house?"
2320,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Where are all the folks? Where is this, and whose breakfast is that?"
2321,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Are we to eat it, Grandma? It is nicer than ours. Why don’t you sit"
2322,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"down in that pretty chair? Here is a little one for me, with wed"
2323,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"cushions. Can’t we stay here every day, Grandma?”"
2324,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2325,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Grandma, feeling unable to stand another minute, tottered forward and"
2326,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"dropped into the softness of the easy chair, and spied, tucked under"
2327,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"the edge of a plate, a sheet of folded paper. Then she fumbled for"
2328,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"what Johnnie called the “speticles that could wead,” and read:"
2329,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2330,MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"Welcome home, dear Grandma Blakslee. Merry Christmas to"

2334,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,
2335,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"No, they hadn’t “done it every bit themselves.” There had been several"
2336,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"fathers and mothers who were glad to help, as soon as they thought"
2337,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"about it. Cora Henderson’s father had said, “Why, Grandma Blakslee"
2338,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,might live in the little empty cottage this winter and welcome;” he
2339,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,wondered they had not thought of it before. Anna Smith’s mother said
2340,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,she would be glad to get rid of that carpet rolled up in the attic;
2341,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"she had no use for it, and it was a pattern she had never liked. Ella"
2342,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,Stuart’s mother said the old arm-chair and the old lounge would do
2343,FROM MISS PARKER’S GIRLS.,"nicely if they were re-covered, and she was sure she did not want them."

2367,II.,bath as often as I thought they ought. While I was considering this
2368,II.,"problem, an Armenian gentleman gave me something over two dollars to"
2369,II.,"use as I saw fit. Thinking “cleanliness next to godliness,” though the"

2381,II.,written a few lines of boyish admiration for the heroes of his own
2382,II.,"race, the Armenians. And so he must die alone of typhus fever after a"
2383,II.,"four months’ imprisonment, utterly cut off from all his friends. Poor"

2396,II.,"of the senior class in the high school, took charge of the second of"
2397,II.,"these. After going over the lesson, she began to ask personal questions:"
2398,II.,
2399,II.,"“Now, girls, what have you done for Jesus this week?”"
2400,II.,
2401,II.,A hand was raised.
2402,II.,
2403,II.,"“What is it, Marta?”"
2404,II.,
2405,II.,"“I let Funduk have my comb for Jesus’ sake. It was such a nice one, I"
2406,II.,did not like to have her use it; but Miss Goulding told me I ought to
2407,II.,be kind to Funduk.”
2408,II.,
2409,II.,"Then Armenoohe said that going home from school one day, a girl she"
2410,II.,"did not know very well called out, “Armenoohe, run and get me another"
2411,II.,clog; mine’s broken.” (The clog is a wooden sole with a heel at each
2412,II.,"end, as it were, and a leather strap to slip the foot into. These heels"
2413,II.,"are from one to three or four inches in height, and raise the foot well"
2414,II.,"out of the mud or snow.) “At first,” said she, “I thought that it was"
2415,II.,"no affair of mine, and that the girl was rather impudent to ask such a"
2416,II.,"thing. Then I remembered what you told us, Isgoohe, about not pleasing"
2417,II.,"ourselves; so I asked her which was her house, and got the clog and"
2418,II.,"brought it to her, and she never even thanked me!” (It was not so very"
2419,II.,long since Armenoohe herself had learned to say “thank you.”)
2420,II.,
2421,II.,Two or three others told their little efforts at denying self; then the
2422,II.,bell rang for the afternoon service.
2423,II.,
2424,II.,In the evening I invited any who wished to talk with me to come to my
2425,II.,"room. Soon afterward Rakel came. She was rather a pretty girl, with"
2426,II.,"bright red hair; she was full of fun, and a dreadful tease. She dropped"
2427,II.,on to the hassock at my side in a bashful sort of a way.
2428,II.,
2429,II.,"“Was there something you wanted to say, Rakel?”"
2430,II.,
2431,II.,"“Yes,” came the whispered answer; “I want to love my companions.”"
2432,II.,
2433,II.,"I enlarged a little upon the duty and privilege of loving others,"
2434,II.,"and then waited for her to speak; but she was silent so long, that I"
2435,II.,finally asked if there was anything else she wished to say.
2436,II.,
2437,II.,“Yes; how can I love those who make me angry?”
2438,II.,
2439,II.,"Well, that was a problem, to be sure! But then, the dear Saviour can"
2440,II.,"help us solve every problem, so we knelt and prayed, both of us, for"
2441,II.,his help in this particular matter.
2442,II.,
2443,II.,"She had been gone but a minute, when her cousin Sarra came, Bible in"
2444,II.,"hand, to ask the meaning of the verse, “Whether therefore ye eat, or"
2445,II.,"drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” There were"
2446,II.,"several other verses she wanted explained, and then by a little gentle"
2447,II.,"questioning, I learned some more of the trouble between her and Rakel,"
2448,II.,"who she said was always teasing her, using her books, and leaving them"
2449,II.,about carelessly. Then she hung her head and confessed that when she
2450,II.,"found her Bible on the divan, and Fido tearing out a leaf, she had at"
2451,II.,"once blamed Rakel, and retaliated by getting her Bible and banging it"
2452,II.,on to the floor.
2453,II.,
2454,II.,"“Was that right, Sarra? Do you think that was one way to glorify God?”"
2455,II.,
2456,II.,"“No,” she replied honestly, but her voice was low and husky. Then we"
2457,II.,"talked of the way Christ bore with men and their cruelty and sins, and"
2458,II.,"we asked him to make us gentle and patient, kind to others, even when"
2459,II.,they were unkind to us.
2460,II.,

2462,II.,blessed day.

2480,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,“WHAT IF I HAD!”
2481,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2482,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2483,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"NEW YEAR’S morning and the snow lying deep over all the paths, drifted"
2484,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,even to the tops of the fences! Plenty of work for Stephen Watson;
2485,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,he frowned a little as he looked out of his attic window in the cold
2486,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,gray of the early morning and saw his nicely-made paths all carefully
2487,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"covered. But almost before the frown had cleared away he laughed,"
2488,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,and broke at last into a cheery whistle. “No great loss without some
2489,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"gain.” He stopped to make this wise remark aloud, then went on with his"
2490,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,whistling. What he longed for just now was a holiday—a chance to take a
2491,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,run across lots to Dick Wheeler’s home and see the new book which his
2492,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,uncle sent him for Christmas. A beautifully bound book with “oceans of
2493,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"pictures,” and telling all about a journey to Europe. “Not a stupid"
2494,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"history,” Dick reported, “but a regular story, telling all about how"
2495,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"some folks went and had jolly times, and saw no end of things, and"
2496,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,described them.” Stephen’s brain was fairly whirling with a desire to
2497,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,examine this book. It may as well be owned that a book of almost any
2498,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"sort had wonderful attractions for this boy; and books and papers, and"
2499,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"indeed reading matter of any kind, were painfully scarce in the country"
2500,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"farmhouse where Stephen was chore boy. Mrs. Griggs, the mistress, did"
2501,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,not more than half believe in them; she eyed even Stephen’s Geography
2502,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"with suspicion, and occasionally asked her husband “What sense there"
2503,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,was in that boy’s learning where all the rivers and mountains in
2504,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,creation with outlandish names were to be found. What good would it do
2505,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,him? He would never find them outside of a book.”
2506,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2507,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Well, Stephen had smiled and whistled, because he saw that this heavy"
2508,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,fall of snow was likely to further his plans for a holiday. If it had
2509,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,only drifted enough to make the roads to the ledge farm impassable then
2510,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Mr. and Mrs. Griggs would stay at home and take care of the house, and"
2511,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"when his chores were done, he might possibly be allowed to go over to"
2512,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Dick’s.
2513,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2514,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Everything seemed to be shaping according to his plans. Mr. Griggs
2515,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,remarked at the breakfast table that there “wouldn’t be no sense in
2516,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,trying to get to Mary Ann’s that day; the ledge road always drifted
2517,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"if it could get a chance, and the wind was still blowing in that"
2518,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"direction.” Mrs. Griggs had sighed, it is true, and said that “Mary"
2519,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Ann would be dreadfully disappointed,” but she, too, had said that she"
2520,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,supposed there was no use in trying to go.
2521,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2522,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Stephen went about his chores with a will, a trifle sorry for Mrs."
2523,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Griggs, and a little curious over the idea that anybody in the world"
2524,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,could be much disappointed over not receiving a visit from her and
2525,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Mr. Griggs. “But then I suppose it is because they are her father
2526,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"and mother, and that makes a difference,” said this orphan boy, with"
2527,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,a sigh. But he could not help being glad that they were not to go.
2528,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,What if he got the chores all done so early that there were several
2529,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"hours before dinner, and Mr. Griggs would let him go in the forenoon?"
2530,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Wouldn’t that be a lark worthy of the day! Dick Wheeler’s mother was
2531,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"always good-natured, and twice she had asked him to stay to supper with"
2532,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Dick; there was everything to be hoped for in that direction. He was
2533,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"coming from the old well with two brimming pails of water, when Mr."
2534,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Griggs, out by the ash barrel, with his hands in his pockets to keep"
2535,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"them warm, dashed the boy’s hopes to the ground. “Got about through,"
2536,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Stephen? Then I guess you may hitch up, after all. The wind has gone"
2537,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"down, and Mis’ Griggs is disappointed, and she thinks we better try it."
2538,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,You may get things ready as fast as you can; we ought to be off if we
2539,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,are going; then you’ll have a long warm day in the kitchen. Don’t on no
2540,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"account leave the place; that wouldn’t do, of course.”"
2541,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2542,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Not a word said Stephen, though he would like to have thrown the pails"
2543,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"of water over Mr. Griggs, and kicked the empty pails into a snowdrift."
2544,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,He had never been so disappointed in his life! “A long warm day in the
2545,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,kitchen!” If there was any day which he utterly hated it was such an
2546,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,one; not even a new almanac to read—Farmer Griggs had been waiting for
2547,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"one to be sent to him from somewhere, and it had not come. Of course"
2548,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,there was nothing to do but obey; but Stephen felt that he hated New
2549,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Year’s dinners, and wished that “Mary Ann” lived fifty miles away, and"
2550,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,hoped that Farmer Griggs would encounter a drift so deep that Mother
2551,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Griggs would be rolled over in the snow! Oh! he was fierce enough to
2552,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,wish almost anything.
2553,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2554,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,It was because of all this that a very glum-faced boy looked out of
2555,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"the small-paned kitchen window about two hours afterwards, and watched"
2556,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,a single horse and cutter skim gaily along. Only one person in the
2557,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"sleigh, and he muffled in furs, and looking as though life was one"
2558,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,long holiday. Stephen believed that everybody but himself was having a
2559,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,holiday. Suddenly the sleigh drew up in front of their gate. “Halloo!”
2560,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"said the man in furs, and Stephen ran out and down the snowy path."
2561,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“Good-morning! Happy New Year,” said a pleasant voice. “Can you tell me"
2562,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,whether this is the right road to Mr. Bennett’s farm?”
2563,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2564,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“Yes, sir, it is.”"
2565,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2566,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,“How far from here to Mr. Bennett’s?”
2567,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2568,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“Five miles, sir; but there are none of them at home.”"
2569,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2570,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,“They are not? How do you know that?”
2571,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2572,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“I know the boy who drives their horses, and he went by awhile ago; he"
2573,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"was on his way back from Dr. Freeman’s, where he had been to take Miss"
2574,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Carrie—Mr. Bennett’s daughter—and the boy said his folks were all away
2575,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"for the day, and he was going to his grandmother’s to dinner.”"
2576,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2577,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Stephen could not help adding that last, because it had been a very"
2578,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,bitter drop in his cup of trouble. Mr. Bennett’s house could stay
2579,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"alone, it seemed, while the boy went to his grandmother’s to dinner,"
2580,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,whereas this old farmhouse had to be watched as though there was danger
2581,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,of its running away.
2582,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2583,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“That is the state of things, is it?” said the stranger. “Thank you; I"
2584,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,do not care to take a five-mile drive through these drifts to find a
2585,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,shut-up house. Can you tell me where Dr. Freeman lives?”
2586,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2587,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,“He lives about a mile from here; but Miss Carrie Bennett isn’t there
2588,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"now, sir; she has gone with Miss Freeman to bring a Miss Banks, who"
2589,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"lives two miles west, to eat dinner with them at the doctor’s.” Stephen"
2590,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,told this story with an amused twinkle in his eye; it struck him as a
2591,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,queer thing that he should be so well posted concerning matters which
2592,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,evidently interested this handsome stranger. The stranger turned on him
2593,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"a keen, questioning glance. “You seem to understand your neighbors’"
2594,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"affairs very well indeed, my boy. How does it happen?”"
2595,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2596,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Stephen laughed. “Why, Pete just happened to tell me about it, sir;"
2597,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"he said he was in luck, and did not have to drive them there himself,"
2598,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,because the doctor’s team drove up in just the nick of time and took
2599,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,them. Everybody is in luck except me.”
2600,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2601,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“Is that so?” asked the stranger, his face breaking into a genial"
2602,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"smile. “I am certainly, since I have found a quick-witted boy who has"
2603,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,saved me ten miles of useless driving. Can you do me another favor
2604,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"now, and let me come in and visit with you for awhile, until in your"
2605,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,judgment the doctor’s team has had time to find Miss Banks and bring
2606,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,her back? I do not happen to be acquainted with any of the party save
2607,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Miss Bennett, and would prefer waiting until she is there before I make"
2608,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,my call.”
2609,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2610,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Mr. Griggs never refused travelers a chance to warm, and of course"
2611,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Stephen invited this one into the house and did the honors of the
2612,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,kitchen as well as he could. Somehow—he never quite understood how it
2613,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,was—he found himself telling the story of his bitter disappointment to
2614,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,this stranger—all about the wonderful book full of pictures and stories
2615,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,of travel. He was astonished afterwards to think how much he talked;
2616,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"but then, the stranger listened so kindly, and his eyes were so bright,"
2617,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"and his smile so pleasant, and he asked so many questions, it seemed"
2618,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,impossible not to confide in him.
2619,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2620,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"“So you like books,” he said, as at last he arose; “and books of"
2621,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"travel? Well, I do myself; and it happens curiously enough that I"
2622,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"have a package of books in my sleigh at this moment, two of which I"
2623,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"think you would enjoy. I was taking them to a nephew of mine, and"
2624,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,missed seeing him; probably because it was intended that you should
2625,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,have them instead. I owe you a debt of gratitude; and I’ll exchange the
2626,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,information you gave me for whatever information you can find in the
2627,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"books, which are yours to keep, you understand. And now don’t you think"
2628,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,Miss Banks may have arrived at the doctor’s by this time?”
2629,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2630,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"Stephen helped him off in good style, but in such a flutter of"
2631,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"excitement that he could hardly respond to the cheery “good-by,” for in"
2632,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"his hands were two very large, very handsomely bound books, sparkling"
2633,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"with pictures, and with the most inviting-looking reading. They must"
2634,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"certainly be larger than Dick Wheeler’s one, for that had been minutely"
2635,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"described to him. Besides, there were two of these; and besides, oh!"
2636,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"besides, they were his very own, to keep!"
2637,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,
2638,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"As he turned the leaves, like one in fairyland, he said aloud, “What"
2639,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,if I had got a chance to go to Dick Wheeler’s this morning and missed
2640,“WHAT IF I HAD!”,"this? O, my! what if I had!”"

2662,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2663,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,His house was in a big hollow tree. The door to it was a little round

2665,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2666,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"All day long, in the pleasant Oc-to-ber weather, when children were"
2667,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"playing, Bunny was picking nuts and scampering down the trees to put"
2668,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,them safe in his pantry.
2669,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2670,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,He had a good many kinds of nuts. There were butternuts and walnuts and
2671,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"chestnuts, and tiny beechnuts for the teeny weeny squirrels. At last"
2672,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"Bunny’s pantry was full, and he was all ready for December with its"

2674,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2675,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,One morning something happened! Just as Bunny started out he found
2676,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,a wire cage in front of his door. He thought it was a pretty little
2677,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"house, so he walked in."
2678,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2679,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"Snap! went the door of this pretty little house, and shut itself tight."
2680,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2681,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"Bunny tried on every side to get out, but he could not. He was in a"

2683,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2684,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,While he wondered what he should do a big boy came and looked at him.
2685,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2686,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,“Hurrah!” he said.
2687,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2688,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,Then big boy took up the cage and carried it off home.
2689,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2690,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,He gave Bunny to his little sister Susie.
2691,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2692,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,Susie was kind to Bunny. She put him in a basket with a soft bed and
2693,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,gave him cake and candy.
2694,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2695,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,But Bunny was not happy. He was too warm in the house with his fur coat
2696,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"on, and he wanted to get back to his dear children. He would not play;"
2697,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,he sat still and looked sad.
2698,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2699,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"“Poor Bunny!” said Susie’s mamma; “he is used to being outdoors, and"
2700,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,frisking about. He wants to see his little children and eat the nuts he
2701,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,laid up.”
2702,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2703,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"“Then he shall go,” Susie said."

2705,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,[Illustration: “THEN HE SHALL GO.”]
2706,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2707,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,"So she told him good-by, and carried the cage out in the garden and"

2709,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2710,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,Away went Bunny! He scampered over the fence and whisked up a tall tree
2711,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,as quick as wink.
2712,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,
2713,WHAT HAPPENED TO BUNNY.,How happy he was to get to his hollow tree once more.

2726,PART II.,
2727,PART II.,"IT was a January night, very cold. The snow which was always on the"
2728,PART II.,mountains looked down on the snow which sometimes melted from the
2729,PART II.,"valleys, and seemed to smile at it in a hard, cold way, for supposing"
2730,PART II.,itself to be of any importance at all. The white cross made by the
2731,PART II.,"peculiar shape of the mountains, and the action of the sun on the snow,"
2732,PART II.,"gleamed in the moonlight more beautiful than usual to Teddy Simpson,"
2733,PART II.,"as he pushed back the overcoat several times too large for him, thrust"
2734,PART II.,"his hands into his pockets, and leaned against the snow-covered hill"

2743,PART II.,"letter in his life, nor even a paper through the mails. To have done so"
2744,PART II.,even once would have almost taken his breath away. Yet he was deeply
2745,PART II.,interested in the teamster’s wagon; as he stood still in the moonlight
2746,PART II.,"to think, there was an eager look in his eyes, and he listened for the"
2747,PART II.,sound of the cracking whip with such an air of expectancy as his face
2748,PART II.,"did not often wear. The fact is, Teddy Simpson had planned a wonderful"
2749,PART II.,surprise for his mother which his friend the teamster was helping him
2750,PART II.,"to carry out. Very poor they were, he and his mother; she cooked for"
2751,PART II.,"the miners, and washed for them, and mended their clothes, but the"
2752,PART II.,"miners, too, were poor, and could pay but little. The truth is, the"
2753,PART II.,"people who lived and worked in this beautiful, desolate region were all"
2754,PART II.,"poor together. Teddy had had plans, beautiful plans, for the Christmas"
2755,PART II.,"three weeks behind him, and had failed in them. He and his mother"
2756,PART II.,knew all about Christmas; had not she hung up her stocking every year
2757,PART II.,of her life until she was a great girl fifteen years old? Teddy never
2758,PART II.,"had, because Santa Claus seemed never to get so far West as where he"
2759,PART II.,lived; but while the father was alive Teddy always had at least one
2760,PART II.,"Christmas present, if it was nothing but a picture cut from some of"
2761,PART II.,"the illustrated papers of the tourists, and framed by his mother with"
2762,PART II.,some bits of bright paper laid away for such purposes. Teddy had been
2763,PART II.,a man grown now for two years—at least he felt like one—with no time
2764,PART II.,for such trifles; but he had longed to make a bright Christmas for the
2765,PART II.,"miner’s family with five little children, their nearest neighbors. If"
2766,PART II.,his mother had not had a sick day when he was obliged to do her work as
2767,PART II.,"well as he could, and in doing it wasted some of the material and lost"
2768,PART II.,"a good deal of time, he thought he should have accomplished it. As it"
2769,PART II.,"was, he could not get the Christmas treat ready for them, but promised"
2770,PART II.,himself that another year he would be on hand. Then he had turned his
2771,PART II.,"thoughts to a surprise for his mother. That, too, had been a Christmas"
2772,PART II.,"plan, but failing then, he resolved that he would not wait for the next"
2773,PART II.,season. The surprise was nothing more nor less than a half-pound of the
2774,PART II.,best tea which the silver half-dollar he had sent by the teamster could
2775,PART II.,supply. The poor little overworked mother was very fond of tea; he
2776,PART II.,had often heard her say that a good cup of it after a hard day’s work
2777,PART II.,"seemed to rest her as nothing else would; but since the father died,"
2778,PART II.,she had bravely put it aside as one of the luxuries which they could
2779,PART II.,not now afford.
2780,PART II.,
2781,PART II.,If there were time to tell you how long and hard Teddy had worked for
2782,PART II.,"that extra half-dollar, never taking a cent for it from the regular"
2783,PART II.,"wages of the day which he earned as his share of the family support,"
2784,PART II.,you would not wonder that he had grown almost feverish in his anxiety
2785,PART II.,"as the weeks went on, lest he should fail in having the right amount."
2786,PART II.,"He had accomplished it, and the day had come for the teamster to go"
2787,PART II.,"on his fortnightly trip, and the day and evening had arrived for his"
2788,PART II.,"return, and here at a bend in the road Teddy waited for him."
2789,PART II.,
2790,PART II.,Away in the distance on the still frosty air broke at last the sound of
2791,PART II.,"a cheery whistle, and Teddy held himself still and listened. Jim Coon,"
2792,PART II.,"the teamster, was a friend of his, and Teddy did not believe he would"
2793,PART II.,whistle if anything so cruel had happened as that the supply grocer had
2794,PART II.,been out of tea.
2795,PART II.,
2796,PART II.,"“Halloo!” said Jim, as he came with a flourish around the bend in the"
2797,PART II.,"snowy road, “waitin’, be you? I thought it was a ghost froze stiff"
2798,PART II.,"to the rocks. Climb up here, and we’ll be home in a jiffy. Beats all"
2799,PART II.,"what a hurry this team has been in this afternoon—all owing to you, I"
2800,PART II.,"s’pose. O, yes! I got it, safe and sound; the very best kind of tea"
2801,PART II.,"ever brought to these parts, Joe Derrick says, and he put in a good big"
2802,PART II.,"half-pound of it, I’m witness to that.”"
2803,PART II.,
2804,PART II.,"Then Teddy drew a long breath, and immediately the longing which he had"
2805,PART II.,kept in the background came to the front; also the problem over which
2806,PART II.,he had been studying for weeks. Wouldn’t it on the whole have been
2807,PART II.,better to have gotten a quarter of a pound of tea and spent the rest
2808,PART II.,of the money in sugar? mother did so like a little sugar with her tea.
2809,PART II.,"But then, a quarter of a pound seemed such a very little bit, and the"
2810,PART II.,"winter was long in this mountain region, and there was no telling when"
2811,PART II.,"he would have a chance to get any more. But he wished, O, so much! that"
2812,PART II.,he knew how to get just a little sugar; that would make the present
2813,PART II.,complete.
2814,PART II.,
2815,PART II.,"“I got somethin’ else,” said Jim, with a curious note of suppressed"
2816,PART II.,excitement in his tones; “somethin’ for you.”
2817,PART II.,
2818,PART II.,"“For me?” echoed Teddy, amazed."
2819,PART II.,
2820,PART II.,"“Yes, sir, for you; Teddy Simpson is the name on the box, as large as"
2821,PART II.,life.”
2822,PART II.,
2823,PART II.,“On the box!” In his astonishment and excitement all that Teddy could
2824,PART II.,do was to echo Jim’s words.
2825,PART II.,
2826,PART II.,"“Yes, sir, on the box; a good-sized box, and as heavy as though it had"
2827,PART II.,been stuffed with lead. Come by freight; got there yesterday just about
2828,PART II.,"an hour before I drove into town; come all the way from New York State,"
2829,PART II.,too.”
2830,PART II.,
2831,PART II.,"After that, the quarter of a mile between Teddy Simpson and home seemed"
2832,PART II.,"endless. A box by freight for him! What would mother think, and the"
2833,PART II.,"neighbors! Above all, what could be in the box?"
2834,PART II.,
2835,PART II.,Before it was half-unpacked the question became what was not in it? Two
2836,PART II.,"suits of clothes for Teddy, two new dresses for his mother—or dresses"
2837,PART II.,"quite as good as new—a warm, bright shawl, and a fur hood. Shoes, and"
2838,PART II.,"stockings, and socks, and mittens, and oh! books, and papers, and"
2839,PART II.,"pictures, and more books. Was ever anything so wonderful? Then there"
2840,PART II.,"were toys—dolls, and balls, and tops, and wooden dogs, and wax cats,"
2841,PART II.,and cloth elephants—and some little bits of dresses and sacks which
2842,PART II.,"could fit only the children further down the mountain. Teddy felt this,"
2843,PART II.,"even before he discovered that these were all labeled, “For Teddy to"
2844,PART II.,"give to his friends, the little Perkinses.” Moreover, there was a"
2845,PART II.,"little leather bag in the very bottom of the box, drawn together by a"
2846,PART II.,"bright cord and securely tied, which when opened was found to contain"
2847,PART II.,"seventeen bright silver dollars, the gifts of the cousins and aunts and"
2848,PART II.,uncles for Teddy to use as he thought best. Do you want to know what he
2849,PART II.,thought of first? A whole pound of sugar to go with that half-pound of
2850,PART II.,"tea which was still lying snugly in his overcoat pocket, where Teddy"
2851,PART II.,"meant to leave it until the next morning. Such a box as that, and a"
2852,PART II.,"half pound of tea in the bargain, he considered altogether too much for"
2853,PART II.,his mother’s nerves in one evening.
2854,PART II.,
2855,PART II.,"Such a wonderful morning as it was—such a wonderful day, indeed!"
2856,PART II.,"The Perkinses were hopelessly wild all day, and their poor little"
2857,PART II.,half-discouraged mother was not much better.
2858,PART II.,
2859,PART II.,The next time teamster Jim went over the snow road between the
2860,PART II.,mountains he carried a fat little letter written in Teddy’s best round
2861,PART II.,hand—and he was by no means a bad writer; his mother had taught him.
2862,PART II.,In this letter he described to the cousins just how he stood by the
2863,PART II.,"rocks and waited for Jim Coon’s team, just how surprised he was, just"
2864,PART II.,"how the box was opened, just what he and his mother exclaimed as long"
2865,PART II.,"as they had any breath for exclaiming, just how the Perkinses acted"
2866,PART II.,the next day—at least as well as language would do it—and altogether
2867,PART II.,"wrote so surprising a letter that Hortense said, drawing a long sigh of"
2868,PART II.,delight: “Isn’t it lovely? Hasn’t this been a long Christmas? It is
2869,PART II.,"better than the Christmas-tree a great deal, isn’t it?”"
2870,PART II.,
2871,PART II.,"“It is the jolliest Christmas I ever had,” said Holly."
2872,PART II.,
2873,PART II.,"“And it has taught us how to have some more jolly ones,” said Tom."
2874,PART II.,
2875,PART II.,"As for Tom’s father, he said: “That boy Teddy is a smart fellow; he"
2876,PART II.,ought to have an education. There ought to be a good school out there.
2877,PART II.,Why wouldn’t that be a good place for us to send Richard Winston? He
2878,PART II.,would be a grand fellow to work among just such people.”
2879,PART II.,
2880,PART II.,"So the “long Christmas” is in a fair way to grow longer, you see, for"
2881,PART II.,"every cousin in the three homes is interested in Tom’s father’s idea,"
2882,PART II.,and so is Richard Winston.

2895,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"very few pennies of your own to spend; and mamma, like other mammas,"
2896,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,thinks that something which her daughter has made with her own hands
2897,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"is of far more value than an article, however fine, bought at a store."
2898,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,You have been disconsolate for several days because there are so few
2899,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"“things” which you know how to make, and because you have so little"
2900,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"money with which to buy material. Take heart, my dear, there are happy"
2901,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,surprises in store for mamma.
2902,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
2903,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"How much money have you for this particular gift? “Twenty-five cents,”"
2904,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"and you blush and are troubled, and say in your heart, “Just as though"
2905,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"anything worth having could be made for twenty-five cents!” Why, my"
2906,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"dear, that is enough and to spare. Did you notice the table mats"
2907,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,yesterday at dinner? They are made of bits of oiled wood ingeniously
2908,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"put together, and in their prime were pretty, and rather expensive; but"
2909,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"they are sadly worn now—so much so, indeed, that Hannah declared only"
2910,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,yesterday that she did not know what to do with the things; they were
2911,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,so much worn that she could not wash them any more. She knew what she
2912,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,would like to do with them; if she had her way she would “chuck” them
2913,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,into the fire.
2914,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
2915,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"What I propose is, that you plan your Christmas present so that Hannah"
2916,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,can have the pleasure of doing just that thing.
2917,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
2918,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"What you want is a ball of macremé cord, of a delicate creamy tint,"
2919,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"price fifteen cents, and a ball of candle wicking for three cents, or"
2920,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"possibly five, though it ought not to be if your merchants are up with"
2921,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"city prices. Positively that is all. O, yes! a crochet needle, large"
2922,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"size; but that of course you have; or if not, I am almost certain that"
2923,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"mamma, or better still grandma, will make you a present of one, because"
2924,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"of the many useful things you can make with it; still, if you wish to"
2925,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"be entirely independent, why, buy one, for five cents surely (a large"
2926,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"price), and you are ready."
2927,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
2928,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,Hold the end of candle wicking over your left forefinger and crochet
2929,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,the macremé cord over it with what is known as the long stitch; it is
2930,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"very rapid work after you have once mastered the stitch, and before you"
2931,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"realize it, you will have a long, long rope of creamy cord. Do not pull"
2932,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"hard on the crochet cord, but let the work lie up loose and fluffy."
2933,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"When you think you have enough done to experiment with, get your neat"
2934,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"little work box, thread a needle with strong cotton—number thirty"
2935,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,being a very good size—curl the beginning of your cord into a graceful
2936,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"circle, and take firm stitches on the under side to hold it there; then"
2937,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"another coil, and another, sewed neatly and firmly, and continue until"
2938,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"you have a table mat large enough round to take the vegetable dishes,"
2939,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"or the soup tureen, or whatever you wish to set on it. Then cut off"
2940,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"the supply, fasten the end firmly, and finish the whole with a pretty"
2941,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"crocheted scallop all around. Just compare that mat with the slippery,"
2942,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"stained wood one with frayed edges! You admire it now, but what will"
2943,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,it be when Hannah has washed and starched it until it holds its shape
2944,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"as firmly as the wooden one, and yet is flexible and graceful? More of"
2945,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"them? Certainly, an entire set, varying in size to match the uses to"
2946,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,which they are to be put.
2947,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,
2948,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"Have I made a mistake? Are your vegetable dishes all oval? Well, my"
2949,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"dear, your table water pitcher is not, I am sure. Just use this first"
2950,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"one for it, and start your next sewing with an oval shape instead of a"
2951,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,circle; it must be a very small oval for the beginning—not over three
2952,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,quarters of an inch in length—else your mat will grow too long for its
2953,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,width. Your best plan would be to experiment a little. Lay the work
2954,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"loosely, confined by a mere basting stitch, and see whether, when the"
2955,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"mat has grown as long as your paper pattern, it will be of the proper"
2956,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,width. You will not find the planning difficult; it merely needs the
2957,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,patience and carefulness which I feel sure you will bestow; and the
2958,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,result will be an entire nest of pretty and useful mats which will be a
2959,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"delightful surprise to mamma on Christmas morning, and a comfort to her"
2960,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,"as well as to Hannah throughout the year. Try it, and be sure to let me"
2961,SOMETHING FOR MAMMA.,hear how you succeeded.

2973,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
2974,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
2975,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,I CAN see her now as she looked to me that winter morning wrapped in
2976,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"furs, ready all but her fur cap to brave the frosty air, when she held"
2977,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"up in triumph a spray of brilliant bloom, and said: “Look, Aunt Myra,"
2978,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,did you ever see anything prettier than that from a conservatory? And
2979,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"they blossomed in my window-seat!” I was not her auntie, but was so old"
2980,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,and intimate a friend of the family that the children had adopted me.
2981,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
2982,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Hasn’t Ethel a beautiful face?” I said to Miss Margaret, another"
2983,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"friend of the family, who, with myself, was a guest at the Carlisles’."
2984,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,“It is so very bright. Did you notice what a peculiar brightness there
2985,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,is to her eyes when she smiles? And she has a lovely smile.”
2986,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
2987,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Miss Margaret looked grave, almost troubled. “It is a sweeter face than"
2988,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"it will be in a few years, I am afraid,” she said, shaking her head,"
2989,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,which already had threads of silver in it. Miss Margaret was a wise
2990,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"sweet woman, not given to croaking, so I waited somewhat anxiously"
2991,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,to hear her words. “Ethel is cultivating habits which will spoil her
2992,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"face,” she said; “I have not been here before for two years, and I"
2993,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,notice a very decided change in it since then. She was one of the
2994,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"sweetest little children I ever knew, but if you watch through only one"
2995,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,day you will discover what I mean. Unless something occurs to change
2996,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"her habits, there will be another spoiled face in the world in a few"
2997,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,years.”
2998,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
2999,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"I had been in the house but a day, and had been absent from the"
3000,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"country for more than two years, so I knew very little of the younger"
3001,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Carlisles. Ethel had always been my favorite, and it made me sad and a"
3002,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,trifle annoyed to hear Miss Margaret’s words. I felt sure she must have
3003,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,grown over particular.
3004,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3005,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Of course, with such a warning, it would have been impossible not to"
3006,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,have watched. Long before night I knew what Miss Margaret meant.
3007,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3008,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Where in the world is my French Grammar?” I heard Ethel’s voice, with"
3009,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"a very sharp note in it, rasping through the hall. “I left it on the"
3010,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"dining-room table while I ran out to speak to Nellie, and somebody has"
3011,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"taken it. I declare, I cannot lay down a thing for a second and find it"
3012,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,again. I do wish Ann could be taught to let my books alone!”
3013,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3014,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Indeed, Miss Ethel, I have not touched a book this morning; I have not"
3015,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"dusted in the dining-room yet.” This was Ann’s voice; then Ethel’s,"
3016,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"by no means sweetened: “That is perfect nonsense, Ann; I left it here"
3017,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"not two minutes ago, and now it is gone. What do you think could have"
3018,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,become of it? It couldn’t walk off without hands.”
3019,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3020,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Ethel!” from Mrs. Carlisle, in a reproving tone, “do not speak so to"
3021,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Ann, daughter; she has not been in the dining-room since breakfast.”"
3022,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3023,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Well, but, mother, my French Grammar is gone that I just laid there,"
3024,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"and the bell is ringing; I shall be late, and I think it is just too"
3025,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"bad!” There was an ugly frown all over the fair forehead, and a sharp"
3026,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,and at the same time whining tone to the voice which had been so sweet
3027,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,but a little while before.
3028,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3029,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Ethel,” called her older sister Nannie from the hall above, “here is"

3032,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Away went Ethel without a word of explanation to mother or to Ann, and"

3035,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3036,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"I heard the mother sigh, and was sorry for her, and glad that the"

3039,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3040,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"Ethel came home at lunch time, and was out of sorts with the soup"
3041,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"because it tasted of onions, and with the squash because it had been"
3042,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"peppered. She said she wished anybody ever consulted her tastes, and"
3043,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,she would just as soon think of puffing tobacco smoke in the face of
3044,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,people as of eating onions for them to smell afterwards. She scolded
3045,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,her brother Tom for forgetting the music he was to call for; and when
3046,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"he said he was very sorry, and it was because he had so many important"
3047,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"errands for his father that he forgot it, she tossed her head and said"
3048,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"sharply, “Oh! you needn’t explain; of course you would forget what I"

3055,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"she entered that day, and complained of unkindness or of discomforts at"
3056,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"every turn. Yet at family worship, when she played,"
3057,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3058,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“Sun of my soul, thou Saviour dear,”"
3059,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3060,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"and led the singing with a very sweet voice, she looked like an angel."
3061,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"It broke my heart to hear her, not ten minutes afterwards, scolding"
3062,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,Baby Frank for overturning her spool basket. “You are just a little
3063,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"nuisance!” she said, sharp-voiced again; “I think mamma ought to whip"
3064,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"you. Well, mamma, I do,” in response to a reproving look from her"
3065,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"mother; “you are just spoiling him, I think.”"
3066,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3067,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,“Is it possible that this is a fair specimen of that child’s days?” I
3068,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"asked Miss Margaret, as we went down the hall together."
3069,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,
3070,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"“I am afraid it is,” said Miss Margaret. “She is learning to frown and"
3071,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,"fret over the veriest trifles, and to answer even her mother rudely,"
3072,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,as you noticed just now. How many years of such living will it take to
3073,ETHEL CARLISLE’S FACE.,utterly spoil the pretty face? Isn’t it strange that a young girl who

3101,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"IF my father and mother had been at home it would never have happened,"
3102,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,but they started in the morning as soon as they could see the road for
3103,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"my Aunt Margaret’s, taking Emeline with them. I remember just how I"
3104,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,felt when I saw them drive from our gate with Emeline sitting between
3105,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"them; it seemed so terrible, somehow, to think of her sitting in my"
3106,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"place, because I was the one who always sat between father and mother."
3107,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"But Cousin Emeline was Aunt Margaret’s little girl, and word had come"
3108,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"that Aunt Margaret was very sick, and that Emeline must be brought home"
3109,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"as fast as possible; so of course they started, though there was every"
3110,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"sign of a storm, Uncle Peter said, and he hardly ever made a mistake in"
3111,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,the weather. He was our “signal service” in those days. Cousin Edward
3112,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"was at our house, too; he was Uncle Edward’s son, and always spent his"
3113,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"short vacation with us, because his folks lived too far away for him"
3114,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"to go home. He was thirteen years old, and thought he knew all there"
3115,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"was to know in life. He was a smart fellow, and would have been real"
3116,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,nice if he had not felt so sure of it himself. Father and mother had
3117,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,not been gone an hour when he began to plan to drive to town to the New
3118,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Year festival which was to be held in one of the churches, and take me"
3119,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,along. Kirke said everything in the world to hinder us from going; he
3120,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,thought it was going to storm.
3121,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3122,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,“Who’s afraid of a few snowflakes?” said Edward. “I want Nannie to have
3123,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,a cheery time for New Year’s; it is dreadful dull for her with Auntie
3124,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,and Uncle both gone.”
3125,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3126,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Kirke was a boy who did chores at our house for his board, and went to"
3127,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"school; we lived two miles nearer the schoolhouse than his mother did,"
3128,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"and they were pretty poor, and Kirke earning his board away from home"
3129,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,helped them a good deal. We all loved Kirke; he was a good sensible
3130,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"boy, and stood at the head of his classes in school. But I did not"
3131,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,approve of him that day; I wanted to go to town. I was a silly little
3132,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"thing in those days, not afraid of anything; I laughed at the storm"
3133,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,just as Edward did.
3134,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3135,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“It will be more than a few flakes,” Kirke said, shaking his head"
3136,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,gravely; “I think we are going to have the worst storm of the season.”
3137,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Then Edward began to make fun of him—call him Uncle Peter, and ask what"
3138,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,kind of a winter it was forty years ago; because Uncle Peter was always
3139,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,going back to old times and telling stories about the weather. Kirke
3140,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"kept good-natured, and laughed with me over Edward’s speeches, but for"
3141,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,all that he did not stop trying to keep us from going to town.
3142,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3143,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“Look here,” he said, “I have a tip-top plan for this afternoon. Mrs."
3144,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,Baker gave me a jug of molasses and some splendid ears of pop-corn to
3145,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"take home: suppose you and Nannie walk out home with me, and we will"
3146,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"pop some corn, and make candy with hickory nuts in? We’ve got a bushel"
3147,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"of nuts stored away in the garret, and we’ll have no end of fun. Nannie"
3148,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"can stay all night—she has done it before, you know—and sleep with my"
3149,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"sister Mary, and you and I will turn in with little Billy up in the"
3150,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,attic; he likes company.”
3151,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3152,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,The picture looked quite inviting to me; I had often been out to
3153,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Kirke’s house, for my father and mother liked their family very much,"
3154,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,and were always willing to have me play with their children.
3155,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3156,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"But Edward was not to be persuaded. “No, you don’t, old fellow,” he"
3157,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,said; “candy and nuts are first-rate things for any night in the year
3158,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,but New Year’s; a fellow needs something extra then. I’ve set my heart
3159,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"on seeing the festival tables, and watching them give out the prizes,"
3160,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,and I’m going; my uncle said three days ago that I could.”
3161,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3162,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“But he did not know that it was going to snow,” Kirke said, more and"
3163,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"more anxious. “Really, Edward, I do not think Mr. and Mrs. Baker would"
3164,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,like to have you take Nannie out when it looks so much like a storm.”
3165,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Then Edward got angry and told Kirke to mind his own business, that"
3166,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"we were not left in his charge at least, and that he should do as he"
3167,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,liked; and Kirke was to remember that Mr. and Mrs. Baker were his own
3168,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"uncle and aunt, and that he might be supposed to know as much about"
3169,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"what they would like as a stranger could. Kirke said no more, but he"
3170,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"looked very much troubled. I was half-disposed to give up the plan,"
3171,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,but Edward laughed at me. The good-natured housekeeper in whose care
3172,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"we were left never paid much attention to the weather, and made no"
3173,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,objection to my going. I don’t know but that it would have come out all
3174,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"right even then, if Edward’s pride had not got the upper hand. He took"
3175,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,a notion to drive to town by the old road.
3176,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3177,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“O, don’t!” I urged; “you do not know that way at all, and Uncle Peter"
3178,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,said this morning that the wind last night must have drifted the snow
3179,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,on the old road.”
3180,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3181,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“Poh!” said Edward, “Uncle Peter is an old croaker; he’s an old man,"
3182,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Nannie, and always makes mountains out of molehills. The wind will be"
3183,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"at our backs part of the time on the old road, and I’m going that way."
3184,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"What if I have not driven it? The horse won’t get lost, if you think I"
3185,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,will.”
3186,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3187,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Well, we started, and for the first ten minutes everything was right;"
3188,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"then we began to come to drifts, and I was dreadfully scared. We almost"
3189,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"turned over two or three times. I kept squealing out, and that provoked"
3190,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Edward. “Keep still,” he would say; “I did not know you were such a"
3191,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"little coward.” To make matters worse, it began to snow harder than I"
3192,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"ever saw it before, and grew so dark that we could hardly see our way."
3193,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"We had been riding a good while, and ought to have reached the town,"
3194,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,but no sign of a town was to be seen.
3195,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3196,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,After a while Edward made up his mind that he must have taken the
3197,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"wrong turn, and said he was going back a little way to see if he had."
3198,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"He tried to turn around, but the wind blew so that the snow blinded"
3199,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"his eyes; and it was not a good place for turning around, any way. The"
3200,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"first thing I knew over went the sleigh, and I was in a snowdrift!"
3201,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"That was not the worst of it, either; the runner of the sleigh snapped"
3202,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"as if it had been a pipe-stem. Good old Jim stood still, fortunately."
3203,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"But there we were with a driving storm, with a broken sleigh! I do"
3204,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,not think I was ever so glad of anything in my life as I was to hear
3205,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,Kirke’s voice above the roar of the wind.
3206,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3207,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“What in the world are you doing there?” he said, bounding along over"
3208,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,drifts of snow. “Is Nannie hurt? If she is not all right never mind
3209,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,anything else. Oh! the sleigh is broken. How came you to be on this
3210,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,road? This is not the way to town; it is an old wood road that was used
3211,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"early in the winter, but it is all snowed up; you could not have got"
3212,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,much farther; you ought to have turned to the right a mile below here;
3213,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,I thought you knew the way. Now I’ll tell you what will have to be
3214,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,done. Nannie must go to our house—it is less than a quarter of a mile
3215,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"from here—and I’ll get a rope and tie up that sleigh somehow, enough to"
3216,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,get it and Jim back to the stable; then I’ll tell your folks that you
3217,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,are going to stay at our house all night—shall I?”
3218,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3219,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"[Illustration: “THERE WE WERE, WITH A BROKEN SLEIGH!”]"
3220,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3221,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"He seemed to have forgotten how disagreeably Edward had spoken to him,"
3222,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,and was just as nice as could be. But Edward’s cheeks were pretty red.
3223,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"“No, sir,” he said firmly; “I started out to have my own way and ought"
3224,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,to have the benefit of it. If you will take Nannie to your house I’ll
3225,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,get this rig home myself and take care of Jim; it is not fair that you
3226,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,should lose your New Year’s fun to help me out. I’ll foot it out to
3227,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,your house if it is not too late after I have been to see Mr. Ormstead
3228,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,about mending this sleigh; but I’m not going to let you go for me a
3229,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,single step.”
3230,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3231,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"No amount of coaxing could turn him from his purpose. So at last Kirke,"
3232,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,after helping him to tie up the runner with some twine which they found
3233,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"in their pockets, tucked me under his arm, and we marched off to their"
3234,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,little house.
3235,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,
3236,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"Their kitchen was the cleanest, brightest, cheeriest place you ever"
3237,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"saw, and the molasses taffy was splendid. I had a lovely time; but"
3238,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,there was such a dreadful storm that Edward could not get back that
3239,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"night, and Jim had lamed himself somehow in stumbling through deep"
3240,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"drifts; and it cost four dollars to mend the sleigh, which Edward had"
3241,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"to pay, because my father said he did not believe in boys having their"
3242,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,own way and not being willing to take the consequences. To be sure he
3243,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"gave the money back again, and more too, when Edward’s next birthday"
3244,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,came. But I don’t think Edward ever forgot the lesson. I ought to have
3245,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"been punished too, for I pretended to agree with Edward, even when I"
3246,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,thought he was foolish; but some way I slipped through the trouble and
3247,MOTHER DUNLAP’S STORY.,"had all the pleasure, just as girls often do, I think."

3265,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3266,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"THERE is a story of a little boy who was very fond of angling, and who"
3267,HUNGER AND THIRST.,one day told his grandfather that he had caught a fish as large as a
3268,HUNGER AND THIRST.,horse.
3269,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3270,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"“Look here, Tom,” said the old man, “don’t you know it’s wrong for a"
3271,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"little boy like you to tell such a big untruth? You are not six years,"
3272,HUNGER AND THIRST.,are you?”
3273,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3274,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"“No,” said Tommy; “I am only five, and I’ll not do it again. After this"
3275,HUNGER AND THIRST.,I’m going to tell only little bits of fish stories.”
3276,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3277,HUNGER AND THIRST.,That boy often reminds one of people who talk about being “temperate”
3278,HUNGER AND THIRST.,and “moderate” in the use of things which they ought to let alone
3279,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"altogether. A little glass of strong drink, a little cigar, are just as"
3280,HUNGER AND THIRST.,certainly wrong as a little untruth.
3281,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3282,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"But how can we know what is good or bad for the body? The answer is,"
3283,HUNGER AND THIRST.,that our body itself will tell us. The body has a conscience as well as
3284,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"the soul. Put your hand into a potful of warm water, and your hand will"
3285,HUNGER AND THIRST.,at once let you know if the water is too hot. Go out sleigh-riding in a
3286,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"light straw hat on a cold winter morning, and your ears will soon ask"
3287,HUNGER AND THIRST.,for a warmer cover. After a laborer has been hard at work for eight or
3288,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"ten hours, his body will ask for rest. Make a child sit down in a chair"
3289,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"without moving for six hours, and its body will ask for exercise. Our"
3290,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"body soon lets us know if a coat or a shoe is too tight, or if a burden"
3291,HUNGER AND THIRST.,is too heavy. And it can just as certainly be relied upon to warn us
3292,HUNGER AND THIRST.,against unwholesome food. It is true that we can silence that voice of
3293,HUNGER AND THIRST.,our body’s conscience. After a man has swallowed a good many glasses
3294,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"of bad drink or smoked a cigar every morning for a couple of weeks, he"
3295,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"at last gets “used to it,” as we call it; his nature gets changed, and"
3296,HUNGER AND THIRST.,at last he is unable to let such things alone. But at the first trial
3297,HUNGER AND THIRST.,our sense of taste will plainly warn us against unwholesome food and
3298,HUNGER AND THIRST.,drink. Before an apple is ripe it tastes sour. The taste of over-ripe
3299,HUNGER AND THIRST.,or spoiled fruit gets more and more disagreeable.
3300,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3301,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"An Italian naturalist, during his travels in Southern Africa, noticed"
3302,HUNGER AND THIRST.,that a little pet monkey of his never made a mistake in choosing
3303,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"its food, and could tell poisonous herbs and berries from good ones"
3304,HUNGER AND THIRST.,the moment he tasted them. The traveler made that little creature
3305,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"his kitchen master, as he called it, and always let it try a bit of"
3306,HUNGER AND THIRST.,every kind of food that was offered to him for sale. “If Jocko ate a
3307,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"spoonful of honey and stretched out his hand for more,” he writes, “I"
3308,HUNGER AND THIRST.,was satisfied that it was worth buying; if the little chap grinned and
3309,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"flung the sample away, I felt sure that the bees must have gathered"
3310,HUNGER AND THIRST.,their honey from poisonous flowers. Jocko never made mistakes in such
3311,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"things, and that our own people blundered so often might be explained"
3312,HUNGER AND THIRST.,by the fact that we have blunted our sense of taste with strong drink
3313,HUNGER AND THIRST.,and hot spices.”
3314,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3315,HUNGER AND THIRST.,A boy who has been brought up on perfectly wholesome food can tell
3316,HUNGER AND THIRST.,injurious things almost as quick as that little monkey. He will dislike
3317,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"the taste of sharp pepper sauces, of pickles, of strong cheese, of"
3318,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"spoiled meat, and will not be apt to mistake a bitter swamp berry for a"
3319,HUNGER AND THIRST.,huckleberry.
3320,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3321,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"Our stomach also lets us know when we should stop eating. In that case,"
3322,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"too, it is not safe to disregard the warnings of our bodily conscience."
3323,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"If a boy keeps eating, just to while time away, after he feels that he"
3324,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"has had enough, and after his stomach has asked him again and again to"
3325,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"stop, his nature at last changes, and he wants to be stuffing himself"
3326,HUNGER AND THIRST.,all the time. I knew a little chap of ten years who seemed to think
3327,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"it a pity to lose a chance for gorging himself, and who had to be"
3328,HUNGER AND THIRST.,watched like a tricky cat to keep him from slipping into his mother’s
3329,HUNGER AND THIRST.,pantry and helping himself to all the good things in sight. On his
3330,HUNGER AND THIRST.,way to school he would stop to buy a package of peanuts or pick up a
3331,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"pocketful of apples on the outside of an orchard, and when he came home"
3332,HUNGER AND THIRST.,for dinner he ate away as if nothing had happened. All his schoolmates
3333,HUNGER AND THIRST.,called him “Glutton Joe.”
3334,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3335,HUNGER AND THIRST.,Such gluttons are apt to think that they are getting more fun out of
3336,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"life than other people. The truth is, that they hardly ever know an"
3337,HUNGER AND THIRST.,hour of real happiness. They feel dull and weary; they become too
3338,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"sluggish to play; they take no interest in their studies, and drop a"
3339,HUNGER AND THIRST.,new book or new paper after a short look at the pictures; they would
3340,HUNGER AND THIRST.,rather not know the end of a pretty story than go to the trouble of
3341,HUNGER AND THIRST.,reading it through. They feel drowsy as soon as the weather gets a
3342,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"little warm, but when they go to sleep their rest is broken by ugly"
3343,HUNGER AND THIRST.,dreams. Glutton Joe had no friends; he was so cross and lazy that
3344,HUNGER AND THIRST.,nobody wanted him for a playmate.
3345,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3346,HUNGER AND THIRST.,An old fisherman once told me that it was worth while going out sailing
3347,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"in bad, chilly weather, just for the fun of getting home again and"
3348,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"taking a rest in a warm chimney-corner, and I have often thought that"
3349,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"many people would find it worth while to fast once in a while, when"
3350,HUNGER AND THIRST.,they begin to complain that they cannot enjoy their meals. After a
3351,HUNGER AND THIRST.,day’s exercise in the woods and mountains the plainest food tastes
3352,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"well. A supper of bread, milk and huckleberries tastes better to the"
3353,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"poor Tennessee mountain boy, who has been out herding cows all day,"
3354,HUNGER AND THIRST.,than a banquet of thirty dishes tastes to a rich merchant who has
3355,HUNGER AND THIRST.,not yet digested his last meal. There is no danger in an occasional
3356,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"fast, though some people seem to think it a misfortune to miss one of"
3357,HUNGER AND THIRST.,their three daily meals. There was a time when rich and poor thought
3358,HUNGER AND THIRST.,it enough to eat one good meal a day. The old Romans and Greeks ate a
3359,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"biscuit and perhaps half a handful of dried fruit in the morning, and"
3360,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"then did not eat again till they had finished their day’s work, when"
3361,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"they took a bath, changed their dress, and then sat down to a good"
3362,HUNGER AND THIRST.,supper. An Indian hunter thinks nothing of going a day without any food
3363,HUNGER AND THIRST.,at all. A few years ago an American physician thought it worth while to
3364,HUNGER AND THIRST.,try how long a man could fast without hurting himself. People thought
3365,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"he was crazy, and told him he would kill himself in less than a week."
3366,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"He made no reply, and his friends changed their opinion when he had"
3367,HUNGER AND THIRST.,fasted forty days and nights. Few of those friends would have cared to
3368,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"try their own pluck in that manner, but they would certainly have been"
3369,HUNGER AND THIRST.,ashamed to complain of an accident that might lose them a dinner and
3370,HUNGER AND THIRST.,oblige them to eat their principal meal in the evening.
3371,HUNGER AND THIRST.,
3372,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"But though there can be no harm in a day’s fast, it is never safe to"
3373,HUNGER AND THIRST.,suffer for want of drinking water. The same doctor who passed nearly
3374,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"six weeks without a mouthful of food, took a sip of cold lemonade every"
3375,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"few hours, and it is a curious fact that in warm weather a glass of"
3376,HUNGER AND THIRST.,water served with our dinner is by far the most important part of the
3377,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"meal. Hunger, or what we call a “good appetite,” often stops after"
3378,HUNGER AND THIRST.,the mealtime has passed without a chance of getting a mouthful of
3379,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"food, but thirst cannot be put off in that way, and becomes at last so"
3380,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"intolerable that a starved traveler, after a three days’ journey in the"
3381,HUNGER AND THIRST.,"desert, would give a wagon-load of food for a drink of cold water."

3407,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"YOU see it is most beautiful to the eye, though you Pansies of the"
3408,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,great cities may think some of your churches quite as handsome. But
3409,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"none of them has such a history. This church was founded—started, as"
3410,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,some would say—more than a thousand years ago! Now where’s your pretty
3411,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,“meeting-house” which was built only last year?
3412,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3413,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Old King Siebert, a Saxon, built Westminster Abbey, and many of the"
3414,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Saxons really believed that the Apostle Peter dedicated it, though"
3415,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,Peter had died nearly one thousand years before!
3416,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3417,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,[Illustration: A VIEW OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY.]
3418,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3419,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"However, this building is not the very same that King Siebert put up."
3420,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"That one stood several hundred years, when Edward, “the Confessor,” as"
3421,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"he was called, rebuilt it. Two hundred years later King Henry the Third"
3422,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"enlarged it, making it look about as it now is."
3423,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3424,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,For years and years the English kings and queens have been crowned
3425,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"here, and buried, too, nearly all. Here the great ones of the nation"
3426,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"are buried—Shakespeare, Milton, Ben Jonson, Wordsworth, and many more,"
3427,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,the poets in the “Poets’ Corner.”
3428,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3429,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Under the coronation (crowning) chair is the “Stone of Scone,” which"
3430,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,some actually say is the very one Jacob laid his head upon when he
3431,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"dreamed! However that be, many kings have sat upon it when they were"
3432,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,crowned.
3433,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3434,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,Of course you will search out the “Jerusalem Chamber” when you visit
3435,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Westminster. The Presbyterian Church began in this chamber. Here, too,"
3436,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,the Bible was revised (re-translated from the Hebrew and Greek).
3437,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3438,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,“Why do they call it the ‘Jerusalem Chamber’?”
3439,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3440,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Probably because its windows came from that old city, and the Cedar of"
3441,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,Lebanon forms the wainscoting.
3442,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3443,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,So this wonderful building has served many purposes besides that of a
3444,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,church. For some hundred years the House of Commons (something like
3445,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"our House of Representatives) made laws here, especially laws to secure"
3446,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,the liberties of the people.
3447,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3448,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,So you see this building is something like Faneuil Hall of Boston and
3449,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,Independence Hall of Philadelphia.
3450,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,
3451,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,What a book Westminster Abbey could make if it only could write. But
3452,WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"somehow, like Nineveh and such places, it will rise up in the Judgment;"

3486,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,There’s dynamite blasting to loosen the earth.

3488,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,"Hurry out now; the tunnel may cave in, and you’ll be choked, as were"

3490,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,
3491,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,"Here we are outside. See, the ground is two feet deep with the earth"
3492,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,"carted out. They are harrowing it, or the rain is falling upon it. It"
3493,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,is crumbling fine. Ah! see the shining treasures. But look out! Don’t
3494,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,put one into your pocket without permission; you are watched.
3495,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,
3496,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,Now back we come—in thought. There! have not we had one of the
3497,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,brightest New Year’s?
3498,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,
3499,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,Thus brighten up your imagination and you need not be bothering
3500,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,yourself forever with cars and steamboats and ships and seasickness
3501,A NEW YEAR’S TRIP.,and such things to see foreign lands. With a good book of travels or

3617,A HERO.,
3618,A HERO.,You see the different tribes of Indians have different mouth or spoken

3620,A HERO.,must have an interpreter to give its meaning; but they all seem to have

3652,A HERO.,“What for?”
3653,A HERO.,
3654,A HERO.,To spread knowledge among the Indians. To give them the Gospel—the

3656,A HERO.,
3657,A HERO.,"“But has not the Bible been put into Indian for them to read, and don’t"

3659,A HERO.,
3660,A HERO.,"Yes, indeed; but don’t you see that for each one of the many tribes it"
3661,A HERO.,may be necessary to have just the Bible and missionary that each can

3663,A HERO.,"can read the Lord’s Prayer, and any other part of the Bible, if put in"
3664,A HERO.,this sign talk. And all the more so because every one can understand a
3665,A HERO.,thing better if he can see the language as well as hear it.
3666,A HERO.,
3667,A HERO.,Now to do this good work Mr. H—— lived among the Indians. He is a
3668,A HERO.,missionary unlike any other. He has suffered much living as the Indians
3669,A HERO.,do to learn this language. Read what Mrs. Degen says: “Would you like
3670,A HERO.,to go out to dine where all the family kneel on an earth floor around

3847,DOLLIES TO THE FRONT.,"were two bridal groups, dressed in satin and old lace regardless of"

3850,DOLLIES TO THE FRONT.,"Mother Hubbard dress, and one very large rag doll, with lips made of"
3851,DOLLIES TO THE FRONT.,"beet juice and eyes of black beads, came to the wedding in the little"

4033,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"FOR a boy who was usually happy, Carl Hammond certainly spent a very"
4034,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"uncomfortable winter. It is true it was his first away from home, and"
4035,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"some people thought he was young to be sent from home, but that was not"
4036,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"the trouble. He was with Aunt Mary, which was almost the same as being"
4037,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,with mother; and the schools where Aunt Mary lived were so much better
4038,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"than at Carl’s own home, that his mother had made the sacrifice, and"
4039,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,sent him away.
4040,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4041,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,His unhappiness had to do with a certain September day which was as
4042,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,bright and beautiful as a sunny day in early autumn can be. Carl
4043,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,remembered every little thing about that afternoon—just how his
4044,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"father’s desk looked, and what books were piled on the table at its"
4045,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"left, and above all, just how Bunce looked when he bounded in at the"
4046,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"window. He was writing to Aunt Mary then, he remembered, telling her on"
4047,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"what train to expect him, and he had held the pen in hand and turned to"
4048,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,laugh at Bunce because he was so ridiculously glad over having found
4049,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"him. He had leaned over and patted the dog’s eager head, and had asked"
4050,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,him how he was going to manage to get along without his playmate all
4051,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,winter; and Bunce had begun to run around his chair in that absurd
4052,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"fashion he had when especially pleased, and had bumped against the"
4053,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,table just as Carl had shouted to him to “take care!” The shout came
4054,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"too late. Bunce succeeded in jostling the table, so that a ponderous"
4055,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"book set too near the edge tumbled off, taking the great cut-glass"
4056,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"inkstand with it, and the contents of that dreadful inkstand spread"
4057,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"itself not only over the costly book, but the handsome carpet as well."
4058,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"If it had happened but the day before, Carl could not have remembered"
4059,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,every little particular more vividly.
4060,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4061,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,Especially what followed; there is no denying that Carl was very much
4062,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"frightened. It seems a strange thing to say, but the truth is, he was"
4063,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,not very well acquainted with his father. Mr. Hammond was connected
4064,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"with a business firm which sent him every year, and sometimes two or"
4065,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"three times a year, to Europe; and between times he had to go South"
4066,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"and West, and Carl hardly knew where else, on business; so that he"
4067,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"was not often at home for many days together, and when there, was so"
4068,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,crowded with business as to have little leisure for his family. Carl
4069,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,had once complained that whenever his father was at home for an hour or
4070,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,two it was always after he had gone to bed. Perhaps on this account he
4071,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"was the more frightened; for his father had great respect for books,"
4072,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,and was particularly careful of the large one that Bunce had ruined.
4073,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,Carl could seem to hear his quick firm voice giving directions:
4074,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4075,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Remember, my son, you are on no account to allow Bunce in the study;"
4076,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,he is a dangerous fellow in such a place; he can hardly move without
4077,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,doing injury. Be careful always to close the sash window when you go
4078,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"there, lest he might follow you.” And Carl had been in the study on the"
4079,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"day in question for a half hour, with the sash window wide open. Not"
4080,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"that he had forgotten, but he believed Bunce to be a mile away taking a"
4081,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,walk with his young mistress; and he said to himself: “It is very much
4082,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"pleasanter with the window open, and of course papa does not care when"
4083,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,Bunce is away.” As if Bunce could not return at any moment! which he
4084,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,presently did. Even then Carl might have ordered him instantly out and
4085,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"closed the sash, but the dear fellow was so absurdly glad to see him,"
4086,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,and ran around in such a funny fashion to show his joy that it seemed
4087,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,too bad to dismiss him at once. Therefore the result which I have given
4088,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,you.
4089,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4090,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"But this was not the end of the story. Carl arose in great alarm, and"
4091,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"without even attempting to repair damages, which indeed would have been"
4092,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"beyond his skill, made all haste from the room, taking Bunce with him"
4093,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"and closing the sash window carefully. Then, an hour afterwards, when"
4094,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"his father’s stern voice questioned: “Carl, do you know anything about"
4095,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"the accident in the study?” What did Carl do but ask: “What accident,"
4096,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,sir?”
4097,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4098,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,“The overturning and breaking of the large inkstand and the spoiling of
4099,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,a very valuable book. Did you have anything to do with it?”
4100,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4101,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“No, sir,” said Carl; “I had not.”"
4102,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4103,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,The poor fellow told his conscience that he really did not have a
4104,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"thing to do with it, that the dog did all the mischief while he sat"
4105,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"perfectly still, and that his father was the one who had left the book"
4106,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,open on the table so dangerously near the edge. But his conscience had
4107,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"been better taught than that, and would have nothing to do with such"
4108,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"flimsiness. It told him plainly before he slept that night, that the"
4109,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"name of such talk, in plain English, was lying!"
4110,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4111,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,Nobody questioned Carl further; his friends were in the habit of
4112,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"believing his word, and his father had been almost immediately"
4113,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"called away by a telegram, so that indeed there had been no time to"
4114,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"investigate. Two days afterwards, Carl himself left home. Now you know"
4115,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"why his winter had been uncomfortable. The simple truth was, that"
4116,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"he was an honorable, truth-loving boy, who had been astonished and"
4117,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"dismayed at himself for telling what was not true, and who could not"
4118,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"help despising himself for it. Moreover, he knew that if there was"
4119,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,one sin more than another which his father hated with all his earnest
4120,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"nature, it was the sin of lying."
4121,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4122,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,It may be surprising to think that a boy like Carl should be half the
4123,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,winter making up his mind to tell the exact truth; nevertheless such
4124,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"was the case. The longer he put it off, the more impossible it seemed"
4125,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,to him to write to his father and explain his share in the mischief.
4126,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"But at last, one snowy winter day, only two weeks before the holidays,"
4127,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,he did it. He felt better as soon as the letter was mailed. He told
4128,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"himself that no matter what his father said in reply, he knew he had at"
4129,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"last done right, and should be glad over it. Still he watched for the"
4130,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"home letter more anxiously than ever before. It was from his mother,"
4131,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"with a little note enclosed, for Carl’s private reading, from his"
4132,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,father.
4133,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4134,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“A fellow couldn’t have a better letter,” said Carl, wiping his eyes,"
4135,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,and feeling a warm glow in his heart for the dear father who had been
4136,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"so kind and gentle, and yet honest and plain-spoken. Less than a"
4137,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"week afterwards, Carl was on his way home. His mind was in a strange"
4138,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,confusion as the train neared the home station. He could not help
4139,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,feeling just a little sorry that his father was at home. “Of course
4140,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"he will punish me,” thought the poor fellow. “I suppose he must; he"
4141,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,always punishes disobedience. What if he should not let me see mother
4142,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,to-night! Or perhaps he will not let me go to Grandma’s with the family
4143,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"to-morrow. I’d most rather he would whip me, and perhaps he will!”"
4144,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4145,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,Over this thought the twelve-year-old boy’s heart almost stood still.
4146,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"His father had not often punished him in this way, but on the very"
4147,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"rare occasions when it had to be done, it was managed in such a manner"
4148,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,that Carl distinctly remembered it. By the time the train ran into
4149,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,the station he had succeeded in working himself up to such a pitch
4150,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"of excitement that he was almost tempted to run away, to avoid the"
4151,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"disgrace of this home-coming. But his father was there, waiting."
4152,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4153,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Here’s my boy!” Carl heard him say, and in a minute more the father’s"
4154,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"arms were around him, and the father’s kiss was on his cheeks. Mother"
4155,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"was waiting in the carriage, and not a word during the quick ride home,"
4156,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"nor at the joyous supper table afterwards, was said to him about his"
4157,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"fault. They went to Grandma’s the next day in great happiness, and"
4158,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"the next day they went to Uncle Will’s. “I am having a holiday,” his"
4159,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"father explained, “in honor of my boy’s home-coming. I am taking a"
4160,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,longer vacation from business than I have had before in two years.” The
4161,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"days passed, and not a word was said to Carl about his disobedience"
4162,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,and falseness. Nobody could be kinder or more thoughtful for his
4163,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"comfort and pleasure than his father, yet Carl could not help wondering"
4164,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"when and how his punishment was to come. At last, one evening, when"
4165,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"they were alone together for a few minutes, he resolved to discover."
4166,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Father,” he said, and his voice trembled a little, “when are you going"
4167,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,to punish me?”
4168,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4169,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"His father turned astonished eyes upon him. “Punish you, my dear boy!"
4170,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,For what?”
4171,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4172,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"Carl’s cheeks were very red. “Why, father, don’t you know—surely you"
4173,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,remember? I wrote about it.”
4174,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4175,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“But surely, my boy, I wrote you about it! Did I not tell you I forgave"
4176,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,you utterly?”
4177,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4178,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“O, yes, sir! but then I thought—that you would think”—Carl stopped in"
4179,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,confusion.
4180,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4181,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“You thought I must remember the sin, and punish the sinner, even"
4182,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,though I had forgiven him? Is that it?”
4183,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4184,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Yes, sir,” said Carl, low-voiced and troubled."
4185,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4186,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“No,” said Mr. Hammond, and Carl noticed how tender his voice was;"
4187,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,“I do not remember anything about it in the sense which you mean. Do
4188,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,you remember my telling you once that God meant fathers to be object
4189,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"lessons to their children, giving them some faint idea, at least, of"
4190,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,what kind of a father God would be to those who trusted him?”
4191,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4192,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Yes, sir,” said Carl."
4193,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4194,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"“Very well, then, here on this card, which I would like you to keep in"
4195,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"your Bible, is my answer to your question.”"
4196,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4197,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"The card was a lovely blue celluloid, and had printed on it in gold"
4198,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"letters, the words, “I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember"
4199,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,their sin no more.”
4200,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,
4201,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"One evening, when Carl was twenty years old, he repeated that verse"
4202,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"in a Christian Endeavor prayer meeting, and said that his father’s"
4203,CARL HAMMOND’S LESSON.,"commentary on it had made him understand it. Then he told, in brief,"

4218,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4219,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4220,HOWARD’S WAY.,"THEY were all in the library after dinner, and were all talking at"
4221,HOWARD’S WAY.,"once, as the Edwards family were inclined to be. “I don’t see why"
4222,HOWARD’S WAY.,"we always have so much more to say than other people seem to,” Lora"
4223,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Edwards had once remarked, setting them all into shouts of laughter."
4224,HOWARD’S WAY.,Howard was not talking; his head was bent low over a Latin dictionary.
4225,HOWARD’S WAY.,"They were waiting for some of the family, because they always gathered"
4226,HOWARD’S WAY.,"at this hour in the library for evening prayers; but Howard, while he"
4227,HOWARD’S WAY.,"waited, saved the minutes, remembering the hard lesson of the morning,"
4228,HOWARD’S WAY.,and the liability to be interrupted in his study hour.
4229,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4230,HOWARD’S WAY.,The back parlor door was pushed open and Uncle Edward’s handsome form
4231,HOWARD’S WAY.,appeared. “Where is Ashman Square?” he inquired.
4232,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4233,HOWARD’S WAY.,Several voices at once attempted to answer him. “It is just off of
4234,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Second Street,” said Lora. And Emma in the same breath said, “It is"
4235,HOWARD’S WAY.,"over by the river somewhere; near Park Street, isn’t it?” Then Dickie,"
4236,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Why, Lora, it can’t be near Second Street, because Wyeth Avenue runs"
4237,HOWARD’S WAY.,in there.”
4238,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4239,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“No, it doesn’t; Wyeth Avenue crosses at Third Street.”"
4240,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4241,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Then exclamations from at least four: “Why, Lora Edwards! Wyeth Avenue"
4242,HOWARD’S WAY.,isn’t near Third Street. I think Ashman Square is down by the Lincoln
4243,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Statue; isn’t it, papa?”"
4244,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4245,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“I am sure I don’t know,” said papa, who just then entered the room."
4246,HOWARD’S WAY.,“The city changes so rapidly and adds so many fancy names that I cannot
4247,HOWARD’S WAY.,keep track of it. Who wants to know—Edward? There is a map about
4248,HOWARD’S WAY.,somewhere. I shouldn’t wonder if Ashman Square was down near the old
4249,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Ashman place, towards the river.”"
4250,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4251,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“There!” said Emma, “I was sure it was near the river.”"
4252,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4253,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“But the river is quite a stream, my dear niece,” Uncle Edward said,"
4254,HOWARD’S WAY.,smiling.
4255,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4256,HOWARD’S WAY.,“Yes; but Ashman Square is not very far down; it is near the Westfield
4257,HOWARD’S WAY.,car line.”
4258,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4259,HOWARD’S WAY.,Then a perfect babel of voices ensued.
4260,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4261,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“O, Emma, no!”"
4262,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4263,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Emma Edwards! it is a quarter of a mile from the Eastman line, I am"
4264,HOWARD’S WAY.,certain.”
4265,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4266,HOWARD’S WAY.,“I don’t think Ashman Square is on this side at all; I think you are
4267,HOWARD’S WAY.,all confused.”
4268,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4269,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Yes, it is; I pass it every day, but I don’t remember on which side"
4270,HOWARD’S WAY.,"of the avenue it is. I go down one way and come up another, and so get"
4271,HOWARD’S WAY.,things mixed.”
4272,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4273,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“I don’t think any of you know much about it,” said Uncle Edward, and"
4274,HOWARD’S WAY.,"this time he laughed. Several voices began again in eager disclaimer,"
4275,HOWARD’S WAY.,"but Father Edwards silenced them: “See here, children, we must have"
4276,HOWARD’S WAY.,"prayers at once; I have an important engagement at seven. Afterwards,"
4277,HOWARD’S WAY.,one of you can find a map and settle your discussion.”
4278,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4279,HOWARD’S WAY.,Lora struck the chord and the entire family joined in:
4280,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4281,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“While Thee I seek, protecting Power,"
4282,HOWARD’S WAY.,Be my vain wishes stilled.”
4283,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4284,HOWARD’S WAY.,"In the momentary lull which there was as they rose from their knees,"
4285,HOWARD’S WAY.,"Howard spoke, for the first time that evening."
4286,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4287,HOWARD’S WAY.,“Uncle Edward.”
4288,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4289,HOWARD’S WAY.,“Yes.”
4290,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4291,HOWARD’S WAY.,“About Ashman Square—do you know where the Station D post-office is?”
4292,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4293,HOWARD’S WAY.,“Perfectly.”
4294,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4295,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Well, Ashman Square begins two blocks east of that.”"
4296,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4297,HOWARD’S WAY.,“So it does!” declared Lora; “why in the world didn’t some of us think
4298,HOWARD’S WAY.,of the post-office? that would have located it.”
4299,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4300,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“I never noticed how near it was to the post-office,” said Emma. “What"
4301,HOWARD’S WAY.,"I would like to know is, why Howard did not speak before, and save us"
4302,HOWARD’S WAY.,all this talk.”
4303,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4304,HOWARD’S WAY.,“Sure enough!” said Dickie. “Did you find the answer to that conundrum
4305,HOWARD’S WAY.,"in your Latin dictionary? Why didn’t you look up, old fellow, and join"
4306,HOWARD’S WAY.,the colloquy?”
4307,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4308,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Couldn’t get a chance,” said Howard, with a good-natured smile; “you"
4309,HOWARD’S WAY.,"all had a great deal to say, and were bent on saying it, all at once;"
4310,HOWARD’S WAY.,"I thought I would keep still until the shower was over, and in the"
4311,HOWARD’S WAY.,meantime a grain of fact might be evolved out of it; but there wasn’t.”
4312,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4313,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“Howard always waits until there is clear sailing,” said Lora. “I’ve"
4314,HOWARD’S WAY.,noticed that he is the only one in our family who isn’t apparently
4315,HOWARD’S WAY.,burning to speak at the same moment when some one else is.”
4316,HOWARD’S WAY.,
4317,HOWARD’S WAY.,"“And when he does speak it is to the point,” said Uncle Edward. “Much"

4332,BY THE PANSIES.,"a man so good and kind to sailors, and to people in distress on the"
4333,BY THE PANSIES.,"water, that he was named St. Botolph, because the word “Botolph” is"
4334,BY THE PANSIES.,"made from two words, which mean boat help. After a while the word"
4335,BY THE PANSIES.,"“Boston” grew out of the name, and the place where this man had lived"

4396,HELEN WESTOVER.,"of places, and showed me the picture of Ann Pollard; she lived to be a"
4397,HELEN WESTOVER.,"hundred and five years old, and she was the first to jump from the boat"
4398,HELEN WESTOVER.,when the colonists came over from Charlestown; she was only ten years
4399,HELEN WESTOVER.,"old then, and she gave a spring from the boat just as it was touching"

4408,ANNIE POLLARD.,"WE have been studying in school about John Hancock and his times, and"
4409,ANNIE POLLARD.,our teacher told us about his wife’s breakfast party at the old Hancock
4410,ANNIE POLLARD.,"House. It was in 1778, and a French fleet came into Boston harbor."
4411,ANNIE POLLARD.,Governor Hancock proposed that the officers be invited to breakfast;
4412,ANNIE POLLARD.,"so his wife had her table set for thirty officers, and instead all"
4413,ANNIE POLLARD.,the under officers of the fleet came also—a hundred and twenty more
4414,ANNIE POLLARD.,than were expected! Mrs. Hancock must have been in a panic for a few
4415,ANNIE POLLARD.,"minutes, but she got out of her difficulties. First, she ordered all"
4416,ANNIE POLLARD.,"the cows on the Common milked, and the milk brought to her; then she"
4417,ANNIE POLLARD.,"sent among her friends and borrowed cakes and other things to help out,"
4418,ANNIE POLLARD.,and gave them all a very nice breakfast.

4423,ANNIE POLLARD.,invited the governor and his wife to visit his fleet and bring their
4424,ANNIE POLLARD.,friends. This was Mrs. Hancock’s chance to be politely revenged upon
4425,ANNIE POLLARD.,him for bringing so many people to breakfast; she invited five hundred
4426,ANNIE POLLARD.,friends to go with her to the fleet! But they were politely received

4435,FANNIE BROOKS.,lived there I suppose it looked fine. I like old John Hancock; it is
4436,FANNIE BROOKS.,great fun to read about him. Of course it was all nonsense for him
4437,FANNIE BROOKS.,"to think that Washington ought to call on him first, that time when"
4438,FANNIE BROOKS.,"Washington went to Boston to visit in 1789, but for all that I think"
4439,FANNIE BROOKS.,"it was awfully cute, the way in which Hancock finally backed down. He"
4440,FANNIE BROOKS.,"had the gout, you know, so he did himself up in flannel and had his men"

4452,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,ninety-seven steps. Not every father thinks that a child of eight
4453,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,"could appreciate such things. Many and many a time since then, have"
4454,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,I thanked my father for helping me to enjoy the remembrance of things
4455,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,which I never expect to see again. During that visit to Boston a boy
4456,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,ten years old took from my grandfather’s library a copy of one of
4457,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,"the “Jonas” books which he coveted. The book was never missed, but"
4458,JOHN STUART WINTHROP.,twenty years afterwards the boy returned it with compound interest and

4468,MRS. OLIVIA C. WARNE.,very statue. It is in Scollay Square. Governor Winthrop is dressed just
4469,MRS. OLIVIA C. WARNE.,"as they used to dress in his time; he has a Bible in one hand, and a"
4470,MRS. OLIVIA C. WARNE.,copy of the king’s charter in the other. There is a carved rope wound
4471,MRS. OLIVIA C. WARNE.,around a carved tree which stands for the ship that brought him over. I
4472,MRS. OLIVIA C. WARNE.,"went to the beautiful State House, too. It is the one which was begun"

4484,HARRY WESTFIELD.,On the steeple is the date “1723.” The chime of bells on this church
4485,HARRY WESTFIELD.,are just lovely! I heard them play. One of them has on it these words:
4486,HARRY WESTFIELD.,“We are the first ring of bells cast for the British Empire in North
4487,HARRY WESTFIELD.,"America.” Another bell says: “Since generosity has opened our mouths,"
4488,HARRY WESTFIELD.,our tongues shall ring aloud its praise.” Inside the church are some
4489,HARRY WESTFIELD.,queer wooden angels. The pews are very old-fashioned. The Bible in
4490,HARRY WESTFIELD.,the desk was the one that George the Second gave to the church. After
4491,HARRY WESTFIELD.,making this visit I learned “Paul Revere” and recited it at school; you

4520,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I will tell you some things about myself which I should like you to
4521,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,remember.
4522,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4523,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I am growing old pretty fast, and if I had not the kindest master in"
4524,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,the world I would stand a slim chance.
4525,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4526,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"My smelling is good yet, and things taste nice enough, but my teeth"
4527,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"are nearly gone. Bones which once would have been a luxury, now do me"
4528,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,little good. The best I can do is to lap off a little of the meat and
4529,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,grease.
4530,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4531,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Yes, I can bark loud enough yet, but it vexes me terribly when I see"
4532,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"the cattle in the field where they do not belong, or some wicked boys"
4533,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"in the orchard stealing apples, to know that about all I can do is to"
4534,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,bark.
4535,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4536,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I do not pretend that I have been a perfect dog, but I have had a great"
4537,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"deal of experience in my day, and am not without the hope that you,"
4538,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"my young friends, may profit by what I have seen and heard and felt"
4539,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"myself, and known in the lives of others."
4540,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4541,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"No, I shall not try to tell it all to-day; I have no wish to bore you"
4542,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"with “long yarns,” as the sailors say. Besides, there would not be time"
4543,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,before Fido might be wanted to go with his mistress across the pasture
4544,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,when she takes that beef tea to Willie Jones. She never seems afraid
4545,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"with her pet along. Bose, too, will be wanted to drive home the cows;"
4546,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"so I will tell you only a little to-day, and more another time."
4547,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4548,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Where I was born I really do not know, but I am inclined to think it"
4549,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"was a great way from here, perhaps in another country; we will never"
4550,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"know, I suppose, though it seems to me it must be nice to know where"
4551,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"one came into the world, and what kind of father and mother he had."
4552,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"But, dear me, I have seen some dogs, and folks too, who would have been"
4553,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,happier if they had never known their parents!
4554,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4555,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I can just remember seeing my mother once. I think she must have been
4556,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,beautiful. The man who took me away from her often said in my hearing
4557,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,that I had her hair and eyes.
4558,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4559,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I can remember how mother cried when they carried me away. I had never
4560,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"seen her cry before, and though I was awfully frightened, yet I felt"
4561,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,sorry for her.
4562,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4563,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I was petted enough, and had plenty to eat, but the journey was long,"
4564,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and shut up in that little box I was dreadfully lonesome.
4565,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4566,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"But finally we reached home; then I had a warm bed, and a nice place;"
4567,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,but some nights I was terribly scared there in the dark all alone. The
4568,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"boys had a pet donkey, and the first night I was there that fellow made"
4569,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"his horrid bray. My! I thought I should die with fright. Well, when I"
4570,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"had got a little used to the donkey, what should I hear in the tree"
4571,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,over my head but a horrid “To hoo! to who?”
4572,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4573,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Yes, Sport, you may wag your tail and laugh; you know “who,” for you"
4574,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"are a full-grown dog, and know all about the great staring owl, but"
4575,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,with me it was a different matter.
4576,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4577,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"As I remarked before, I think, my master was kind, and so was mistress,"
4578,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and they had no very small children to torment a little pup. Their
4579,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"little girl was so sweet and kind, it was always a pleasure to kiss her"
4580,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,soft cheek; I do not believe she ever had any nice thing to eat that
4581,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,she did not wish to share with me.
4582,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4583,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Her brother was a noble fellow, too. Not always so thoughtful as his"
4584,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"sister, and sometimes pretty rough; but so long as he did not mean to"
4585,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"be ugly and hurt me, I could bear it."
4586,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4587,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"The worst, I remember, was when their cousins and some of the"
4588,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,neighbors’ children would come for the afternoon on a visit.
4589,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4590,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"At first I was glad to see so many little children, but I soon found"
4591,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"that all children had not such sweet dispositions as my master’s, or"
4592,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,else their parents had not taught them so carefully.
4593,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4594,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"We all ran and romped, and for a time it was jolly enough; but when my"
4595,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"young master and mistress were out of sight, one of those rough boys"
4596,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,would do something to torment me. He pulled my ears and my tail; once
4597,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,he boxed my ears so hard that I cried right out.
4598,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4599,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Then they put me on that donkey’s back, and while I was held there, the"
4600,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,creature made one of those dreadful noises! Then I cried so loud my
4601,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,little mistress came and took me away.
4602,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4603,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,Once I was so frightened by those rude children that I hid under the
4604,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"barn. I could hear them call my name and whistle for me, but I did not"
4605,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,mean to come out till the children had gone.
4606,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4607,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"It seemed a long time, but they finally went—I mean the visitors—and"
4608,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"then I was only too ready to get out, for it was growing pretty dark"
4609,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,where I was.
4610,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4611,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"We were all very much frightened, but when master came home he took a"
4612,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"big iron bar and pried a stone out, and made a hole big enough for me"
4613,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,to crawl through as easy as need be.
4614,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4615,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I cannot make myself believe that those children remembered with
4616,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,pleasure what they had done to me that day. They never looked sweet and
4617,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,happy like little Lucy and her brother.
4618,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4619,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I long ago came to the conclusion that if one would be happy he must
4620,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,try to make others so; and I do not believe it makes much difference
4621,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,whether he walks upon two legs or four.
4622,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4623,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Another thing, I believe one’s usefulness depends very much upon"
4624,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"whether he keeps his eyes open or not. Why, one does not need to be"
4625,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"a full-grown dog to be able to make himself useful, and so thought a"
4626,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,great deal of.
4627,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4628,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Take my case, for example: As I was saying, even when I was quite small"
4629,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,the hired man used to take me when he went after the cows at night.
4630,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4631,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I suppose this was to give me the pleasure of a run in the pasture;
4632,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"they took old Sport along to do the work of driving. He, poor fellow,"
4633,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"was getting pretty old, and could not run fast; but he was a good dog,"
4634,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and was well educated.
4635,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4636,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I did not at first understand how he could know so much—how he could
4637,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"tell the oxen from the cows, and the cows from the steers; and when"
4638,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"there were other cattle mixed up with our master’s, on the road or"
4639,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"anywhere, how he could know which ones to drive in, and which to leave"
4640,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,or drive away.
4641,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4642,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,One day as we were waiting for the hired man to fix a little place in
4643,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"the fence, Sport said something that astonished me greatly."
4644,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4645,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I think I had been saying how I wished I knew as much as he, and could"
4646,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"do what he did. Then he gave me this hint. Said he, “I think our good"
4647,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,master is planning to have you take my place in a few months. Soon I
4648,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"shall not be able to do the work, and if you watch out you will be able"
4649,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"to do all that I have done. Even now,” said he, “you are beginning to"
4650,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,save me a great many steps by starting up the cattle which are lagging
4651,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"behind, or that get out of the way.”"
4652,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4653,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I shall never forget how pleased I was. I almost felt like another
4654,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"dog, and was so glad to think that I could do anything worth any one’s"
4655,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,notice. I feel sure it was a great help to me to have him speak like
4656,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"that, and cannot but think that a great many others might be encouraged"
4657,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,in the same way.
4658,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4659,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Proud little puppy that I was, I almost split my throat barking at the"
4660,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"cattle that afternoon, and was much pleased to see that I could help."
4661,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4662,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,[Illustration: OLD MAJOR.]
4663,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4664,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Well, it was not many weeks after that, when one day the hired man went"
4665,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"off fishing, and the master was all alone at home. It was late in the"
4666,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"afternoon, and he was resting upon the front steps, looking very tired,"
4667,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,for he was not well. I remember I had been wishing for the time to come
4668,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"when I could do something, and would be big enough to watch things. You"
4669,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,see the fishing party had taken Sport with them to watch the wagon. I
4670,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,was thought too young to be taken off so far.
4671,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4672,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I had felt pretty sober all the morning, but the master had spoken very"
4673,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"kindly to me several times, and while sitting there had called me to"
4674,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"him and patted my head, and called me a nice little fellow. Finally he"
4675,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"looked up from the paper he had been reading and said, “Well, Major, it"
4676,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,is about time to go for the cows.”
4677,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4678,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"“Now is your chance,” I said to myself, and off over the big stone wall"
4679,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I went. About the only thing I feared was that he would call me back,"
4680,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,but he seemed too much surprised for that; so I ran away as fast as my
4681,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,four feet could carry me.
4682,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4683,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I did not know so well then where to look for the cows, but scampered"
4684,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,around so fast that I soon caught sight of them and quickly had the
4685,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,whole lot on their way to the yard.
4686,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4687,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"My only mistake was in doing my job too well, for I drove up the oxen"
4688,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and steers and yearlings as well as the cows.
4689,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4690,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"When I had them all near the gate then I barked as hard as I could, and"
4691,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"the master came and let down the bars, and drove in the cows and let"
4692,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,the others go back.
4693,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4694,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Then I remembered how it was generally done, and felt much ashamed of"
4695,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"my blunder. But master called me to him and petted me, and told me I"
4696,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"had been a good fellow. Then late in the evening, when the others came"
4697,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"home, he told them how I had surprised him by driving up the cows, and"
4698,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,never said a word about my mistake in driving up the other cattle. I
4699,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,think that was so kind of him! I know a great many who would have been
4700,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,either so thoughtless or unkind as to have made fun of a youngster’s
4701,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,little blunder when trying to do his best. But he was not that kind of
4702,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,a man. You may be sure I never made that mistake again.
4703,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4704,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Then old Sport came over to my kennel, and congratulated me heartily"
4705,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"on driving up the cows. All I could do was to thank him, and tell him"
4706,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"it was because of the way he had encouraged me, helping me to think I"
4707,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,might do something.
4708,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
4709,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"There have been many changes in farming since I can remember, but the"
4710,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"cows have to be got and milked just as ever, only there seem to be more"
4711,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"of them, and so I must not keep you any longer this time."

4729,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,BESSIE has good times. She lives in the country where the hills are

4731,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4732,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,Every morning after breakfast she puts on her long cloak and her warm

4736,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,[Illustration: BESSIE GIVES CARLO A RIDE.]
4737,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4738,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"Sometimes she runs and draws her sled. It is a new one, painted red,"
4739,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,and is one of her Christmas presents.
4740,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4741,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"Sometimes she sits on the sled, and her brothers give her a nice ride."
4742,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"They play they are ponies, and run very fast. Then Bessie shouts and"

4744,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4745,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,Their home is in that little house beyond the hill. You can see the

4748,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,They are on their way home from school now.

4750,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,Just as they got to the top of the hill Carlo came to meet them. He
4751,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"wagged his tail and licked Bessie’s hand, he was so glad to see her,"

4753,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,

4757,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"“Carlo shall have a ride,” said Bessie. So she took him in her arms and"

4759,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4760,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"She gave it a little push, and away they went, whiz! down the long hill"

4762,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,
4763,A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL.,"Two more rides they took, then Charlie picked up the bag and said,"

4803,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Brockway that bright spring morning. It is true it was only March, but"
4804,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Teddy lived so far South that the month of March meant spring; he was
4805,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"dressed in a neat spring suit, had his little sister Margaret by the"
4806,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"hand, and Sally Amelia, her dollie, under his special care, and was"
4807,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"started for a trip all by themselves to old Auntie Blaikslee’s, almost"
4808,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,a half-mile away!
4809,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4810,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,“Aren’t you afraid to let those two babies go off alone?” Grandmamma
4811,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"asked, looking up from her knitting with a somewhat troubled face."
4812,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4813,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Mrs. Brockway smiled as she answered: “O, no! what could harm them?"
4814,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Teddy knows every foot of the way as well as I do, and every neighbor"
4815,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"along the road; and everybody knows him. Besides, he is seven years"
4816,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"old, and I must begin to trust him.” However, she went to the door and"
4817,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"called after them: “Remember, Teddy, I trust Margaret to you. It isn’t"
4818,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,every little boy of your age who can be depended upon to take care of
4819,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"his sister. And, Teddy, remember you are not to ride with any strange"
4820,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,person who may ask you.”
4821,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4822,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“Course not!” said Teddy, with dignity; “not unless he is Uncle Ben or"
4823,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Deacon West. I can ride with Deacon West—can’t we, muvver?”"
4824,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4825,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“O, yes!” said Mrs. Brockway, smiling. “He is not much more likely to"
4826,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"meet Deacon West on this road than he is to meet the man in the moon,”"
4827,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"she said laughingly to grandma, “but he has to provide for all the"
4828,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,possibilities.”
4829,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4830,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Two hours afterwards Teddy and Margaret, with Sally Amelia somewhat"
4831,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,the worse for being handled by all the grandchildren of old Auntie
4832,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Blaikslee, were trudging back in triumph. The errand entrusted to them"
4833,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"had been carefully done, and Teddy had said over the message he was to"
4834,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"give his mother until he knew it by heart, and had bravely resisted"
4835,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,two invitations from good-natured teamsters to have a ride. He was
4836,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,almost within sight of the corner where they turned into their own
4837,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"grounds, and Margaret had been good and minded beautifully. Truth to"
4838,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"tell, Teddy’s heart was swelling with importance; he had never before"
4839,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,been sent on so long a trip with only Margaret for company. He felt at
4840,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"least ten years old. At the top of the hill he came to a halt. There,"
4841,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"just in front of them, jogging comfortably along, was Jake Winchell,"
4842,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Judge Aker’s hired man. Everybody knew Jake and his old horse and cart,"
4843,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"but nobody, or at least Teddy, had ever happened to meet him in that"
4844,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,direction before; his road always lay the other way.
4845,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4846,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“Halloo!” he said, getting out to fix something about the harness, and"
4847,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"spying the children as he did so, “here’s luck; an almost empty cart"
4848,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,and two nice passengers to have a ride in it down the hill. Don’t you
4849,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,want to jump in?”
4850,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4851,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Teddy never wanted anything worse. For a small minute he hesitated.
4852,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,What was that “muvver” had said? “You are not to ride with any strange
4853,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"person who may ask you.” “Course not!” said Teddy again, indignant with"
4854,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,himself; “just as though Jake was a strange person.” But even while his
4855,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"heart said the words, a voice away down deep contradicted it: “Teddy"
4856,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Brockway, don’t you know she meant anybody you are not used to riding"
4857,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,with? And you never had a ride with Jake.”
4858,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4859,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“What of that?” said Teddy’s other thought, still impatiently; “that’s"
4860,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"because he never comes the way we live; but I’ve talked with him, and"
4861,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"muvver said she thought he was kind to boys, and patient with them,"
4862,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,and everything. Just as if she would care for Margaret and me to ride
4863,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,down hill to the gate! We’re most there; and it is a bad hard hill for
4864,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Margaret; and she has had a long walk.”
4865,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4866,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“Yes, sir, thank you,” he said aloud to Jake, smiling and bowing like"
4867,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"a gentleman. “I should like to ride ever so much, for Margaret’s sake;"
4868,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,she is tired.”
4869,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4870,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“All right,” said Jake, with a good-natured chuckle; “climb in and I’ll"
4871,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"tuck her in after you, and take you a few miles on your road as well as"
4872,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,not.”
4873,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4874,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Little Margaret, who paid small attention to cautions, and who"
4875,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,expected that everybody in the world was bound to be kind to her and
4876,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"help take care of her, took this ride as a matter of course, and was"
4877,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"soon seated beside Teddy, with Sally Amelia tucked safely under her"
4878,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,arm. Jake decided to walk down the hill. “It’s a pretty steep pitch for
4879,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"this part of the world,” he explained, “and the harness ain’t none of"
4880,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,the safest; I guess I better walk.”
4881,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4882,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Teddy looked at the harness and trembled. What would his mother say if
4883,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,she could hear that? Even now it was not too late to ask Jake to set
4884,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"them back again on the dusty road, but how he would laugh and call him"
4885,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"a coward! Teddy couldn’t, and the down-hill ride began."
4886,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4887,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,What made that poor old half-blind horse stumble on a hidden root that
4888,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,particular morning and pitch the crazy old cart forward with such a
4889,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,sudden lunge as to send Teddy rolling down the hill faster than the
4890,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"horse could have traveled? Above all, how did it happen that Margaret"
4891,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"did not fall out, but lay flat in the bottom of the cart and screamed?"
4892,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Nobody knows how any of it happened. They only know that when the
4893,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"almost distracted Jake had succeeded in getting the horse on his feet,"
4894,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"and lifting Margaret in his arms, and trying his best to hush her had"
4895,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"stumbled with all speed to the spot where Teddy had stopped rolling,"
4896,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"the poor little fellow had fainted, and had to be carried by Jake to"
4897,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"the very door of his mother’s house, Margaret trudging solemnly along"
4898,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"by his side, occasionally asking pitifully why Teddy went to “s’eep,”"
4899,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,and why he didn’t wake up.
4900,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4901,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,Poor Teddy “waked up” almost too soon for his comfort. It had been a
4902,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"terrible pain, when he tried to pick himself up from the road, which"
4903,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,had made him faint.
4904,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4905,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Days afterwards, as he lay in his white bed with his leg done in"
4906,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“splints,” whatever they were, and watched the long, bright spring days"
4907,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"full of Southern sunshine and sweet smells, and thought how long it"
4908,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"would be before he could run about again, he would sigh out wearily,"
4909,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"“O, muvver! if I only hadn’t!” Of course his mother tried to comfort"
4910,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"him. Once she said: “But, Teddy dear, you did not mean to do wrong."
4911,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"You supposed of course that because Jake was considered an honest,"
4912,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"clean-souled man, mother would be willing to have you ride with him."
4913,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,It was what we call an error in judgment. If I were you I would be glad
4914,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"that you escaped with only a broken leg, and that dear little Margaret"
4915,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"was not hurt at all, and then try to forget about it.”"
4916,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,
4917,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"Teddy considered this for some minutes with a grave face, and in his"
4918,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,eyes an earnest longing to take the comfort to his heart. But at last
4919,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"he spoke, in the slow, old-fashioned way he sometimes had: “No, muvver,"
4920,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,it was an error in want-to! I knew ‘not to ride with any strange
4921,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,person’ meant with any person that you had not let me ride with before;
4922,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,and I knew I wasn’t doing real heart right; so if Margaret had been
4923,“IF I ONLY HADN’T!”,"hurt it would have been my fault. O, muvver! if I only hadn’t!”"

5031,CARRIE FOSTER.,it. The room is made of iron—I mean the shelves and rafters and all
5032,CARRIE FOSTER.,those things are—and the roof is of copper. It is said to be the only
5033,CARRIE FOSTER.,library in the world that is entirely fire proof. There are more than
5034,CARRIE FOSTER.,"six hundred thousand books, and thousands and thousands of pamphlets"
5035,CARRIE FOSTER.,in this library. Every book which has been copyrighted has to send two
5036,CARRIE FOSTER.,copies to the library. It is about ninety years since books were first
5037,CARRIE FOSTER.,gathered there. It was in 1800 that Congress voted to use five thousand

5039,CARRIE FOSTER.,"that would get books enough to last for a century, but hundreds of"

5075,II.,II.
5076,II.,
5077,II.,ALTHOUGH I am a dog myself I do wonder how some of my race can afford
5078,II.,"to waste so much love upon masters who have so little love for them,"
5079,II.,"or, it would seem, for any one else."
5080,II.,
5081,II.,"Now, for instance, there is Mr. Billings who lives on the hill; just"
5082,II.,"think how he ill-treats and almost starves his dog, cuffing, scolding,"
5083,II.,licking him; and yet that poor fellow is just as glad to see him the
5084,II.,"next time as though he had been petted, and is ready to hunt, drive"
5085,II.,"cows or sheep, or watch all night."
5086,II.,
5087,II.,"I have known that dog ever since he came into the neighborhood, and I"
5088,II.,knew old man Billings long before.
5089,II.,
5090,II.,Being up that way I had a few words with friend Dash the day he
5091,II.,arrived. I found him to be friendly—a dog that any man might love and
5092,II.,"be proud of. I was awfully sorry for him then, and have been ever"
5093,II.,"since, for I did not think much of his master."
5094,II.,
5095,II.,"Sometimes, when I see the poor fellow coming, looking so lean and"
5096,II.,"hungry, I run out into the road with the best bone I have on hand, for"
5097,II.,"a bit of a lunch, and leave it where I know Dash will find it. My! it"
5098,II.,does me good to see him take it down.
5099,II.,
5100,II.,I often think of him trotting for fifteen or twenty miles after that
5101,II.,"team, and as likely as not without a mouthful of breakfast before"
5102,II.,starting.
5103,II.,
5104,II.,This is not mere surmise; he told me so one day—said he had been all
5105,II.,day with nothing to eat but a scrap or two which he happened to find
5106,II.,"on the way; for he had not time to hunt for anything while in town,"
5107,II.,"because he had to stay and watch the things in the wagon. It’s too bad,"
5108,II.,too bad!
5109,II.,
5110,II.,Just think what Dash has done for that man!
5111,II.,
5112,II.,You never heard about it?
5113,II.,
5114,II.,"Well, I will tell you. It was in the spring of last year—the time for"
5115,II.,"washing sheep. When Mr. Billings went for his sheep, all his children"
5116,II.,who were big enough to help drive went along.
5117,II.,
5118,II.,"As he never pets anything that he has, so he never petted his sheep,"
5119,II.,therefore as soon as they heard him call they were much more afraid of
5120,II.,"him than they would have been of our master, I really believe, so away"
5121,II.,they went as fast as their legs could carry them.
5122,II.,
5123,II.,"If it had not been for Dash, Mr. Billings and all his boys could never"
5124,II.,"have penned those creatures. But he seemed to know just what to do, and"
5125,II.,it was not long before they seemed to feel as though they had found a
5126,II.,"friend instead of an enemy in this dog; he worked like a good fellow,"
5127,II.,as he is.
5128,II.,
5129,II.,"After much skillful maneuvering, hard running and gentle barking, the"
5130,II.,"sheep were all finally gotten into the pen, where Billings and his boys"
5131,II.,could take them one by one and wash them with the water which fell over
5132,II.,the dam.
5133,II.,
5134,II.,"After the father and older boys were gone, little Bennie Billings, who"
5135,II.,"is only a few months more than three years old, crawled through the"
5136,II.,garden fence and started after the others.
5137,II.,
5138,II.,"His mother did not miss him, thinking he had gone with his brothers. As"
5139,II.,"it was, Bennie came trotting along while the rest were absorbed in the"
5140,II.,"work of washing sheep, and so was not noticed by any one of them."
5141,II.,
5142,II.,"But faithful Dash had his eye upon him all the while, and felt that it"
5143,II.,was more important that he should look after the boy than the lambs.
5144,II.,
5145,II.,"He tried hard to keep between Bennie and the water, but this he was not"
5146,II.,long able to do.
5147,II.,
5148,II.,"Sliding down the bank the boy crawled out upon a slippery rock, and"
5149,II.,from that fell into the water.
5150,II.,
5151,II.,"It was deep, and Dash had all he could do to drag the little fellow"
5152,II.,to the land. He could not pull him out; but holding on as well as he
5153,II.,"could, he growled very loud."
5154,II.,
5155,II.,"Dash was getting pretty tired, and the case was growing desperate, when"
5156,II.,"a neighbor hearing the growl, came to the rescue."
5157,II.,
5158,II.,Poor Bennie was almost gone; he would not have lived much longer; but
5159,II.,"if help had not come, Dash would have died with the little chap he was"
5160,II.,trying to save.
5161,II.,
5162,II.,"Think of that father kicking Dash after that, or ever forgetting to"
5163,II.,give him all he needed to eat! You would think the boy’s mother would
5164,II.,look after her child’s rescuer; but it is said she has little to do
5165,II.,with.
5166,II.,
5167,II.,It would not seem so strange if the faithful fellow were not all the
5168,II.,time doing things worthy of being remembered.
5169,II.,
5170,II.,"It was only last fall, when the corn was well grown, that this hard"
5171,II.,master came home one rainy night and forgot to fasten the gate after
5172,II.,"him. There were a great many cattle upon the road, and Dash told me he"
5173,II.,could hear the bell upon one old cow dingling away as plain as day all
5174,II.,the time the master was unharnessing the horses. He said he ran out by
5175,II.,the gate and barked as loud as he could when Mr. Billings was going
5176,II.,into the house; but it did no good. So there was nothing for him to do
5177,II.,but go and stay there all night in the hard rain.
5178,II.,
5179,II.,"Telling me about it he said: “I wouldn’t have minded it, though it was"
5180,II.,"so cold and wet, if master had noticed it; if he had just said, ‘Good"
5181,II.,"faithful fellow, you saved our garden and cornfield!’ but he never"
5182,II.,noticed me except to scold me for getting in the way when I came into
5183,II.,"the kitchen to warm myself a little, though he knew there were more"
5184,II.,than twenty head of cattle which would have been in that garden and
5185,II.,cornfield if I had not kept them out.”
5186,II.,
5187,II.,"But for all that he would do the same things over again, or anything"
5188,II.,else that he can do for the comfort and help of his hard master.
5189,II.,
5190,II.,I suspect Dash misses these little kindnesses more for the reason that
5191,II.,he has not always been used to such treatment.
5192,II.,
5193,II.,You see he once had a good master; but the man was taken ill and had to
5194,II.,"go away, and for some reason could not take Dash with him."
5195,II.,
5196,II.,One day when we met down town near the post-office he told me this
5197,II.,story.
5198,II.,
5199,II.,By some mishap the house of his former master took fire. How it
5200,II.,happened he did not seem to know. The mistress had gone into a
5201,II.,"neighbor’s house for a few moments, and had left her baby asleep in the"
5202,II.,"cradle, in charge of a little girl, while Dash watched at the front"
5203,II.,gate to see that no tramp came in.
5204,II.,
5205,II.,"Said he, “I smelt something, and looked around just in time to see that"
5206,II.,little girl as she ran out of the front door crying ‘Fire!’
5207,II.,
5208,II.,"“In a moment I thought of Baby, and saw that the girl had left it in"
5209,II.,"the house; so I dashed through the door and into the thick smoke, and"
5210,II.,"finding the cradle I caught the child by his frock, and pulling with"
5211,II.,all my might I got him out on the floor and dragged him to the door.
5212,II.,"Just as I got him to the first step, where we could breathe again, the"
5213,II.,mother arrived.
5214,II.,
5215,II.,“But she came too late to have saved her baby if it had been in the
5216,II.,"cradle then, for that was already in full blaze. As it was, the poor"
5217,II.,thing was almost smothered with the smoke.
5218,II.,
5219,II.,“How that mother hugged and kissed me! She made so much ado about it
5220,II.,that I felt almost ashamed. Yet I must confess it was gratifying to
5221,II.,know that the mother appreciated what I had done.
5222,II.,
5223,II.,"“Well, after that there was nothing in the house too good for me to"
5224,II.,"eat, no place where I was not welcome, no kennel too nice for me to"
5225,II.,"sleep in, nor was there any lack of petting.”"
5226,II.,
5227,II.,"Just imagine what a change from a home such as that, to the miserable"
5228,II.,one he now has to endure.
5229,II.,
5230,II.,I do feel so sorry for him!
5231,II.,
5232,II.,Sometimes I feel as though I should not be as faithful as Dash is if I
5233,II.,"were in his place; yet I must not forget that duty is duty, and that"
5234,II.,one must not do wrong because he has not been treated as he should be.
5235,II.,
5236,II.,"If this poor fellow’s case were a solitary one, it would not seem so"
5237,II.,bad; but I am sorry to say that all over our land there are as faithful
5238,II.,fellows as Dash treated no better than he.
5239,II.,
5240,II.,Think of those dogs with drunken masters! Think how much they have to
5241,II.,"endure of hunger and cold and abuse, though they are as faithful as"
5242,II.,life. I can hardly keep from growling when I think of it!
5243,II.,
5244,II.,But I must not talk in this way any longer to-day. I have spent the
5245,II.,"hour speaking of another, so we must wait till some other time before I"
5246,II.,can tell you anything more of my own experience.
5247,II.,
5248,II.,Indeed I was not intending to talk all the time about myself; I would
5249,II.,"like to set before you a little of the lives of the best of our race,"
5250,II.,"such as will afford you excellent examples for imitation, that your"
5251,II.,lives may be good and true.

5264,VESUVIUS.,
5265,VESUVIUS.,"NEARLY two thousand years ago there was a mountain, and its name was"
5266,VESUVIUS.,Vesuvius. From the foot of it to the very top it was almost like a
5267,VESUVIUS.,garden.
5268,VESUVIUS.,
5269,VESUVIUS.,"At the bottom were two great cities, called Herculaneum and Pompeii."
5270,VESUVIUS.,"The mountain is there now, and near it is the city of Naples in Italy."
5271,VESUVIUS.,
5272,VESUVIUS.,"[Illustration: ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS, 1880.]"
5273,VESUVIUS.,
5274,VESUVIUS.,"One day, when everything was going on in those great cities just as"
5275,VESUVIUS.,"usual, an awful sound was heard like the firing of ten thousand of the"
5276,VESUVIUS.,"biggest cannon; the earth shook as if it was going to pieces, then"
5277,VESUVIUS.,"it grew dark like night. The sky was filled with flying cinders, or"
5278,VESUVIUS.,something like ashes; the air had a sulphurous smell. All the people
5279,VESUVIUS.,"wondered. Some ran into the street, some took to the boats and rowed"
5280,VESUVIUS.,"away as fast as possible, some screamed. Children clung to their"
5281,VESUVIUS.,"mothers, hiding their faces in their dresses. Animals broke away and"
5282,VESUVIUS.,"ran furiously, dashing themselves against the rocks or plunging into"
5283,VESUVIUS.,the sea; the very birds sighed as they swept through the sky.
5284,VESUVIUS.,
5285,VESUVIUS.,The mountain—this Vesuvius—was on fire; the fire was spouting from its
5286,VESUVIUS.,"top in terrific forms. Smoke, such as you have never seen it, leaped as"
5287,VESUVIUS.,"the darkest thunder clouds upward, while melted earth and rock ran down"
5288,VESUVIUS.,"the sides of Vesuvius like a devouring flood. Before it, the gardens"
5289,VESUVIUS.,"fled away. On it came, rushing, foaming, burning. It leaped upon the"
5290,VESUVIUS.,"houses and buried them, whole streets at once. So suddenly it came that"
5291,VESUVIUS.,few of the people escaped. What a time was that!
5292,VESUVIUS.,
5293,VESUVIUS.,"Think of a whole city, like Philadelphia, buried ten or twenty feet"
5294,VESUVIUS.,"deep, so that in the place of the grand palaces, stores and temples,"
5295,VESUVIUS.,nothing was seen but a smoking furnace—red-hot lava!
5296,VESUVIUS.,
5297,VESUVIUS.,"Not a great while since people began to dig. They dug and dug, and"
5298,VESUVIUS.,"after years of digging there were the streets again and buildings, the"
5299,VESUVIUS.,"merchant selling his goods, babies sleeping in their mamma’s arms, a"
5300,VESUVIUS.,"bride and groom standing up to be married, a funeral procession coming"
5301,VESUVIUS.,"from a house, a miser counting his money, a cruel father beating his"
5302,VESUVIUS.,"child, a loving mother kissing her son, a marriage feast in this"
5303,VESUVIUS.,"house, a dying parent in that. Just as the fierce, quick flood of lava"
5304,VESUVIUS.,"found them, so it buried them, and so they were found after nearly two"
5305,VESUVIUS.,thousand years!
5306,VESUVIUS.,
5307,VESUVIUS.,"Since that awful day the volcano, Vesuvius, has been on fire again and"

5320,AURORA LEIGH.,HOW many of my Pansies are acquainted with her? She is “a woman in a
5321,AURORA LEIGH.,"book,” and the book was written by a woman of whom you have surely"
5322,AURORA LEIGH.,heard—Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I want you to know something about
5323,AURORA LEIGH.,this story book and its author. There are those who think the story is
5324,AURORA LEIGH.,too “grown-up” to interest children; but that is because they do not
5325,AURORA LEIGH.,understand certain kinds of children very well. When I was a little
5326,AURORA LEIGH.,"girl of ten, I was very fond of narrative poems, and read some which"
5327,AURORA LEIGH.,were judged far above my understanding.
5328,AURORA LEIGH.,
5329,AURORA LEIGH.,"Would you like a picture of Aurora’s room, as she describes it? Listen:"
5330,AURORA LEIGH.,
5331,AURORA LEIGH.,“I had a little chamber in the house
5332,AURORA LEIGH.,As green as any privet hedge a bird
5333,AURORA LEIGH.,Might choose to build in. . . .
5334,AURORA LEIGH.,"The walls were green, the carpet was pure green,"
5335,AURORA LEIGH.,"The straight small bed was curtained greenly,"
5336,AURORA LEIGH.,"And the folds hung green about the window,"
5337,AURORA LEIGH.,Which let in the out-door world with all its greenery.
5338,AURORA LEIGH.,You could not push your head out and escape
5339,AURORA LEIGH.,A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle.”
5340,AURORA LEIGH.,
5341,AURORA LEIGH.,"Poor Aurora lost her mother when she was four years old, and her dear,"
5342,AURORA LEIGH.,dear father when she was just a little girl. Then she sailed across the
5343,AURORA LEIGH.,ocean from her home in Italy to her father’s old home in England. When
5344,AURORA LEIGH.,"she first saw English soil, this is the way she felt:"
5345,AURORA LEIGH.,
5346,AURORA LEIGH.,". . .  “oh, the frosty cliffs looked cold upon me!"
5347,AURORA LEIGH.,"Could I find a home among those mean red houses,"
5348,AURORA LEIGH.,Through the fog?. . . Was this my father’s England?
5349,AURORA LEIGH.,.       .       .       .       .       .
5350,AURORA LEIGH.,I think I see my father’s sister stand
5351,AURORA LEIGH.,Upon the hall-step of her country house
5352,AURORA LEIGH.,"To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,"
5353,AURORA LEIGH.,Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
5354,AURORA LEIGH.,As if for taming accidental thoughts
5355,AURORA LEIGH.,From possible quick pulses. Brown hair
5356,AURORA LEIGH.,Pricked with gray by frigid use of life.
5357,AURORA LEIGH.,"A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;"
5358,AURORA LEIGH.,A close mild mouth . . . eyes of no color;
5359,AURORA LEIGH.,"Once they might have smiled, but never, never"
5360,AURORA LEIGH.,Have forgot themselves in smiling.”
5361,AURORA LEIGH.,
5362,AURORA LEIGH.,"You cannot imagine, I think, any life more unlike what Aurora had been"
5363,AURORA LEIGH.,"used to in her home in Florence, than the one to which she came in"
5364,AURORA LEIGH.,England. She describes her aunt’s life as—
5365,AURORA LEIGH.,
5366,AURORA LEIGH.,"“A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,"
5367,AURORA LEIGH.,Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
5368,AURORA LEIGH.,Was act and joy enough for any bird.
5369,AURORA LEIGH.,"Dear Heaven, how silly are the things"
5370,AURORA LEIGH.,"That live in thickets, and eat berries!"
5371,AURORA LEIGH.,"I, alas, a wild bird scarcely fledged,"
5372,AURORA LEIGH.,"Was brought to her cage, and she was there to meet me."
5373,AURORA LEIGH.,Very kind! ‘Bring the clean water; give out the fresh seed!’”
5374,AURORA LEIGH.,
5375,AURORA LEIGH.,You wonder what sort of a little girl she was? She tells us:
5376,AURORA LEIGH.,
5377,AURORA LEIGH.,"“I was a good child on the whole,"
5378,AURORA LEIGH.,A meek and manageable child. Why not?
5379,AURORA LEIGH.,I did not live to have the faults of life.
5380,AURORA LEIGH.,There seemed more true life in my father’s grave
5381,AURORA LEIGH.,Than in all England. . . . . .
5382,AURORA LEIGH.,At first I felt no life which was not patience;
5383,AURORA LEIGH.,"Did the thing she bade me, without heed"
5384,AURORA LEIGH.,To a thing beyond it; sat in just the chair she placed
5385,AURORA LEIGH.,"With back against the window, to exclude"
5386,AURORA LEIGH.,"The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,"
5387,AURORA LEIGH.,Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods
5388,AURORA LEIGH.,To bring the house a message.”
5389,AURORA LEIGH.,
5390,AURORA LEIGH.,"So quiet was she, and pale, and sad, that her aunt’s friends visiting"
5391,AURORA LEIGH.,"there, whispered about her that “the child from Florence looked ill,"
5392,AURORA LEIGH.,"and would not live long.” This made her glad, for she was homesick for"
5393,AURORA LEIGH.,"her father’s grave. But her cousin, Romney Leigh, a boy somewhat older"
5394,AURORA LEIGH.,"than herself, took her to task for this. He said to her:"
5395,AURORA LEIGH.,
5396,AURORA LEIGH.,"“You’re wicked now. You wish to die,"
5397,AURORA LEIGH.,"And leave the world a-dusk for others,"
5398,AURORA LEIGH.,With your naughty light blown out.”
5399,AURORA LEIGH.,
5400,AURORA LEIGH.,"Well, she did not die, but lived to be a sweet, proud, brave, foolish,"
5401,AURORA LEIGH.,"sorrowful, glad, happy woman! You think my words contradict one"
5402,AURORA LEIGH.,"another? No; they may belong to one life, and often do."
5403,AURORA LEIGH.,
5404,AURORA LEIGH.,I do not mean that you will be interested in all her story—hers and
5405,AURORA LEIGH.,"“Cousin Romney’s”—not yet awhile. Some day you will read it, study it,"
5406,AURORA LEIGH.,"I hope, for the beauty of the language, and for the moral power there"
5407,AURORA LEIGH.,"is in it. Just now, my main object is to introduce you, so that when"
5408,AURORA LEIGH.,"you hear the name “Aurora Leigh,” you may be able to say: “I know her;"
5409,AURORA LEIGH.,"she is one of Mrs. Browning’s characters—a little girl from Florence,"
5410,AURORA LEIGH.,who lived with an aunt in England.” Or when you hear Mrs. Browning’s
5411,AURORA LEIGH.,"name, you will say, or think: “She wrote a long poem once, named Aurora"
5412,AURORA LEIGH.,Leigh.”
5413,AURORA LEIGH.,
5414,AURORA LEIGH.,"Why should you care to know that? Because, my dear, it is a little"
5415,AURORA LEIGH.,"crumb of knowledge about English Literature, a study which I am hoping"
5416,AURORA LEIGH.,you are going to greatly enjoy by and by.
5417,AURORA LEIGH.,
5418,AURORA LEIGH.,"Oh! Mrs. Browning wrote many other poems, though the one about which we"
5419,AURORA LEIGH.,have been talking is perhaps considered her greatest. There are some
5420,AURORA LEIGH.,which I think you must know and love. For instance:
5421,AURORA LEIGH.,
5422,AURORA LEIGH.,“Little Ellie sits alone
5423,AURORA LEIGH.,"’Mid the beeches of a meadow,"
5424,AURORA LEIGH.,By a stream-side on the grass;
5425,AURORA LEIGH.,And the trees are showering down
5426,AURORA LEIGH.,"Doubles of their leaves in shadow,"
5427,AURORA LEIGH.,On her shining hair and face.
5428,AURORA LEIGH.,
5429,AURORA LEIGH.,"“She has thrown her bonnet by,"
5430,AURORA LEIGH.,And her feet she has been dipping
5431,AURORA LEIGH.,In the shallow water’s flow;
5432,AURORA LEIGH.,Now she holds them nakedly
5433,AURORA LEIGH.,"In her hands, all sleek and dripping,"
5434,AURORA LEIGH.,While she rocketh to and fro.
5435,AURORA LEIGH.,
5436,AURORA LEIGH.,"“Little Ellie sits alone,"
5437,AURORA LEIGH.,And the smile she softly uses
5438,AURORA LEIGH.,Fills the silence like a speech;
5439,AURORA LEIGH.,While she thinks what shall be done—
5440,AURORA LEIGH.,And the sweetest pleasure chooses
5441,AURORA LEIGH.,For her future within reach.”
5442,AURORA LEIGH.,
5443,AURORA LEIGH.,"There are seventeen verses; of course I have not room for them, but you"
5444,AURORA LEIGH.,will like to find the poem and read for yourselves. It is entitled “The
5445,AURORA LEIGH.,Romance of the Swan’s Nest.”
5446,AURORA LEIGH.,
5447,AURORA LEIGH.,Then there is that wonderful poem of hers called “The Cry of the
5448,AURORA LEIGH.,Children.” Surely you ought to know of that. It was suggested to her
5449,AURORA LEIGH.,by reading the report which told about children being employed in the
5450,AURORA LEIGH.,mines and manufactories of England. It is said that Mrs. Browning’s
5451,AURORA LEIGH.,poem was the means of pushing an act of Parliament which forbade the
5452,AURORA LEIGH.,employment of young children in this way. The poem has thirteen long
5453,AURORA LEIGH.,"verses, every one of which you should carefully read. Let me give you"
5454,AURORA LEIGH.,just a taste:
5455,AURORA LEIGH.,
5456,AURORA LEIGH.,"“Do you hear the children weeping, O, my brothers!"
5457,AURORA LEIGH.,Ere the sorrow comes with years?
5458,AURORA LEIGH.,"They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,"
5459,AURORA LEIGH.,And that cannot stop their tears!
5460,AURORA LEIGH.,The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;
5461,AURORA LEIGH.,The young birds are chirping in the nest;
5462,AURORA LEIGH.,The young fawns are playing with the shadows;
5463,AURORA LEIGH.,The young flowers are blowing toward the west;
5464,AURORA LEIGH.,"But the young, young children, O, my brothers!"
5465,AURORA LEIGH.,They are weeping bitterly.
5466,AURORA LEIGH.,"They are weeping in the playtime of the others,"
5467,AURORA LEIGH.,In the country of the free.
5468,AURORA LEIGH.,. . . . . .
5469,AURORA LEIGH.,
5470,AURORA LEIGH.,"“‘True,’ say the children, ‘it may happen"
5471,AURORA LEIGH.,That we die before our time;
5472,AURORA LEIGH.,Little Alice died last year; her grave is shapen
5473,AURORA LEIGH.,Like a snowball in the rime.
5474,AURORA LEIGH.,We looked into the pit prepared to take her;
5475,AURORA LEIGH.,There’s no room for any work in the coarse clay;
5476,AURORA LEIGH.,"From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,"
5477,AURORA LEIGH.,"Crying ‘Get up, little Alice! it is day.’"
5478,AURORA LEIGH.,"If you listen by that grave in sun and shower,"
5479,AURORA LEIGH.,"With your ear down, little Alice never cries."
5480,AURORA LEIGH.,"Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,"
5481,AURORA LEIGH.,For the smile has time for growing in her eyes.
5482,AURORA LEIGH.,"And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled"
5483,AURORA LEIGH.,In the shroud by the kirk-chime.
5484,AURORA LEIGH.,"‘It is good, when it happens,’ say the children,"
5485,AURORA LEIGH.,‘That we die before our time.’”
5486,AURORA LEIGH.,
5487,AURORA LEIGH.,"It will never do to take more room with this paper, and I have told you"
5488,AURORA LEIGH.,almost nothing about the dear lady who voiced the children’s cry so
5489,AURORA LEIGH.,"wonderfully, and to such purpose! Suppose you let me take her story,"
5490,AURORA LEIGH.,"little bits of it, for the next PANSY. Besides, I want to introduce you"
5491,AURORA LEIGH.,to her dear “Flush.”

5513,A GOOD TIME.,
5514,A GOOD TIME.,As Trudy ran along through the woods she saw a little bluebird singing
5515,A GOOD TIME.,"on a branch, and she found yellow violets and tiny blue flowers with a"
5516,A GOOD TIME.,long name. They had just poked up their heads through the snow. Brave
5517,A GOOD TIME.,little blossoms they were!
5518,A GOOD TIME.,
5519,A GOOD TIME.,Wooden pails hung on all the maple-trees. The sap was running into
5520,A GOOD TIME.,"them. When the pails were full of sap John, the hired man, brought it"
5521,A GOOD TIME.,"into the little sugar house and boiled it, and made nice cakes of maple"
5522,A GOOD TIME.,sugar.
5523,A GOOD TIME.,
5524,A GOOD TIME.,The house had a great fireplace. A bright fire was crackling there.

5528,A GOOD TIME.,[Illustration: TRUDY.]
5529,A GOOD TIME.,
5530,A GOOD TIME.,There was a big black kettle over the fire; it was almost full of sap.
5531,A GOOD TIME.,It bubbled and boiled and made a good smell.
5532,A GOOD TIME.,
5533,A GOOD TIME.,John stirred it with a long wooden spoon. He stirred and stirred a long
5534,A GOOD TIME.,"time, and the fire snapped and the sap boiled, and Trudy watched, and"
5535,A GOOD TIME.,by and by it was done!
5536,A GOOD TIME.,
5537,A GOOD TIME.,"Then papa got a pan of snow, and John dropped little bits from the"
5538,A GOOD TIME.,spoon all over the snow.
5539,A GOOD TIME.,
5540,A GOOD TIME.,"When it was cool Trudy put in her thumb and finger, and plump! went one"
5541,A GOOD TIME.,of the little brown balls into her mouth. Oh! but it was good. Trudy
5542,A GOOD TIME.,thought maple candy was ever so much better than the pink and white
5543,A GOOD TIME.,stuff she bought at the stores.
5544,A GOOD TIME.,
5545,A GOOD TIME.,"She ate and ate, till papa said, “No more, dearie.” So she carried the"
5546,A GOOD TIME.,rest of it to little brother.
5547,A GOOD TIME.,
5548,A GOOD TIME.,"They rode home on the wood sled, drawn by two big oxen. Trudy said it"
5549,A GOOD TIME.,was just the “beautifulest time” she ever had in her life.

5551,A GOOD TIME.,She whispered to papa that she thought God was very good to make so

5818,PART I.,
5819,PART I.,You would not have called her pretty had you seen her as she stood
5820,PART I.,"before that little old-fashioned mirror, pushing in the old-fashioned"
5821,PART I.,"comb into her knot of hair, and trying to make it hold the hair in the"
5822,PART I.,way the pretty new style fancy pins which the girls wore held theirs;
5823,PART I.,"but you would have liked her face, I think; nearly every one did. It"
5824,PART I.,"was quiet and restful looking. She gave very little time to the hair,"
5825,PART I.,for she was late. There was so much to be done mornings that she was
5826,PART I.,very apt to be late—I mean hurried. They never called her late at
5827,PART I.,the store; she was always in her place before the great bell ceased
5828,PART I.,"ringing, but it required much bustling about and some running, to"
5829,PART I.,"accomplish this. She was only thirteen, and most of the girls in her"
5830,PART I.,class in Sunday-school were students at the High School; but Marion had
5831,PART I.,been for more than a year earning her own living. She had charge of the
5832,PART I.,spool-cotton counter in one of the large stores.
5833,PART I.,
5834,PART I.,"It was a matter of some pride to her that she was a small saleswoman,"
5835,PART I.,"instead of a cash girl. She had commenced, of course, in that way; but"
5836,PART I.,"one happy day an unexpected vacancy had occurred at the spool counter,"
5837,PART I.,"and she had fitted in so well that she had been kept there, although"
5838,PART I.,younger than most of the other salesgirls. Her face was quieter than
5839,PART I.,usual this morning. Perhaps because it was such a rainy morning that
5840,PART I.,"she had felt compelled to wear the quite old dress, instead of the"
5841,PART I.,somewhat fresher one which had lately begun to come to the store on
5842,PART I.,pleasant days. Marion had discovered that she needed special grace to
5843,PART I.,help her through the rainy days and the old-fashioned gown.
5844,PART I.,
5845,PART I.,Not very many people were abroad shopping; but Marion had her share
5846,PART I.,"of work, for those who came were in need of such commonplace useful"
5847,PART I.,"things as spool cotton, or tape, or needles. She bent carefully over a"
5848,PART I.,"drawer full of various colors, holding a tiny brown patch in her hand"
5849,PART I.,"the while, trying to match the shade. “No,” she said, shaking her head,"
5850,PART I.,"“that is not quite a match, but I am afraid it is the best I can do."
5851,PART I.,If I were you I would take a shade darker rather than the lighter; my
5852,PART I.,mother always does.”
5853,PART I.,
5854,PART I.,"The middle-aged woman, in a plain gossamer which covered her from head"
5855,PART I.,"to foot, glanced up at the thoughtful young face and smiled."
5856,PART I.,
5857,PART I.,“Does she?” she said. “I like to hear a young girl quote her mother’s
5858,PART I.,"judgment; it is apt to be wise judgment, I have noticed, as I think it"
5859,PART I.,"is in this case. Show me darker shades, please.”"
5860,PART I.,
5861,PART I.,"So another drawer was brought, and yet another, and the young head bent"
5862,PART I.,"with the older one over them, and tried and tried again, and at last a"
5863,PART I.,satisfactory shade was found and the sale was made. Five cents’ worth
5864,PART I.,of thread for fifteen minutes’ work!
5865,PART I.,
5866,PART I.,“Why in the world did you putter so over that old maid and her patch?
5867,PART I.,I should have told her I couldn’t match it and sent her about her
5868,PART I.,business fifteen minutes ago.”
5869,PART I.,
5870,PART I.,It was the girl whose stand was next to Marion who offered this bit of
5871,PART I.,"advice, while the “old maid” in question was but a few steps away from"
5872,PART I.,them looking at pin balls.
5873,PART I.,
5874,PART I.,"Marion turned a warning glance in her direction, and lowered her voice"
5875,PART I.,to answer: “Because I couldn’t find a match sooner. We went over all
5876,PART I.,"the thread drawers on that side, but I think we secured the exact shade"
5877,PART I.,at last.”
5878,PART I.,
5879,PART I.,“What does it signify? Nothing but brown cotton. Wasn’t the patch part
5880,PART I.,cotton? I thought so. The idea of making such an ado over a match for
5881,PART I.,"cheap goods like that! I wouldn’t fuss with such customers, I can tell"
5882,PART I.,you. Five cents’ worth of goods and fifty cents’ worth of bother. You
5883,PART I.,couldn’t have done more for her if she had been your sister.”
5884,PART I.,
5885,PART I.,"Marion looked after the plain woman thoughtfully, then looked down at"
5886,PART I.,"the tiny pin she wore. “I am not sure but she is. Anyhow, I was bound"
5887,PART I.,"to endeavor to please her. I’m an Endeavorer, you know.” She gave the"
5888,PART I.,pin a significant touch as she spoke. It was very small—almost too
5889,PART I.,"small to attract attention—but the letters “C. E.” were, after all,"
5890,PART I.,quite distinct.
5891,PART I.,
5892,PART I.,"“O, bother!” said her neighbor, speaking contemptuously, “so am I; at"
5893,PART I.,least so far as wearing the pin is concerned. I wear it because it is
5894,PART I.,"pretty, and I have so few ornaments that I have to make the most of"
5895,PART I.,them; but as for putting sentiment into spools of cotton and balls of
5896,PART I.,"tape, I can’t do it; the things don’t match.”"
5897,PART I.,
5898,PART I.,"“They ought to,” Marion said gravely. “If you and I don’t put our"
5899,PART I.,pledges into spools of cotton and balls of tape of what use are they?
5900,PART I.,Because we spend our days in just such work.”
5901,PART I.,
5902,PART I.,"“I know it,” with a discontented yawn; “I’m sick and tired of it. It"
5903,PART I.,is a slave life; I’d get out of it if I could. If there was any chance
5904,PART I.,of getting promoted it would be a little different. Belle Mason has
5905,PART I.,"been transferred to the ribbon counter, and she gets more wages and"
5906,PART I.,"sees other sorts of people, and has lots of fun; she hasn’t been in"
5907,PART I.,"the house as long as I have, either; it is just because she was put at"
5908,PART I.,"a counter where she had a chance of pleasing people, and here we have"
5909,PART I.,"just to poke over tape and cotton and pins, and such stuff. I think"
5910,PART I.,it’s mean!”

5925,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5926,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Oh! good-evening, Mrs. Glenn,” she added, as she noticed a lady who"
5927,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,sat sewing with her mother.
5928,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5929,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“What does the child mean?” exclaimed Mrs. Glenn, returning Helen’s"
5930,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"nod, then looking her astonishment at Mrs. Palmer, who said: “What do"

5932,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5933,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Why, the girls are all talking to-day about to-morrow being ‘April"
5934,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"Fool Day,’ and they said a lot of things I don’t understand, about"
5935,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,calling people ‘April fool.’ They all agreed to see who could make the
5936,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"most fools and tell about it Monday. They said I must too, and I didn’t"
5937,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"want to tell them I did not know how to do it, or what it means.”"
5938,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5939,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“You don’t mean to tell me, Helen Palmer, that you don’t know anything"
5940,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"about April fool?” cried Mrs. Glenn, in surprise."
5941,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5942,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“No,” said Mrs. Palmer; “she doesn’t. This is her first year at school,"
5943,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"you know; I have taught her at home, and in our country home she heard"
5944,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,very little but what we told her. I never saw any sense or fun in the
5945,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"custom of fooling on the first day of April, and did not instruct her"
5946,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"in it when I taught her of Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, St."
5947,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"Valentine’s Day, Washington’s Birthday, Decoration Day and Fourth of"
5948,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,July.”
5949,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5950,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,“But what is it?” insisted Helen.
5951,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5952,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Well, my dear, it is a custom which I’ve read has come down hundreds"
5953,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"of years, to send people on ridiculous errands on that day and call it"
5954,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"an April fool. It is done all over Europe, and the Hindoos of India do"
5955,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,exactly the same thing on the thirty-first of March. As I’ve always
5956,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"known it, people not only send others on foolish errands, but they"
5957,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"often play practical jokes, silly and cruel, and actually lie to each"
5958,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,other to fool them. It is a custom much better forgotten than kept.”
5959,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5960,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“I should think so,” cried Helen."
5961,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5962,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“But, mamma,” she continued, “what shall I do? The girls expect me to"
5963,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,tell my share on Monday.”
5964,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5965,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“We’ll see, dear, by and by. Go and put away your things now.”"
5966,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5967,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"Mrs. Glenn went away after tea, and Helen began at once to coax her"
5968,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,mother to tell her how to come up to the girls’ plans without doing
5969,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,anything silly or wicked.
5970,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5971,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“I think, if I were you, I would spend the day surprising people with"
5972,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"something good. Do things to help or please, and when they show their"
5973,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,surprise say ‘April fool!’”
5974,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5975,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“O, mamma! that will be delightful,” cried Helen. “Tell me some things"
5976,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,to do.”
5977,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5978,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“No, my dear, that is your business.”"
5979,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5980,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"All that evening Helen was very thoughtful, and next day she was"
5981,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,unusually busy. At night she declared she had never been so happy.
5982,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"Monday morning she met the girls, and they began to tell their jokes."
5983,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5984,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“I fooled everybody around the house,” said Carrie Andrews. “I filled"
5985,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"the sugar-bowl with salt, and papa got a big spoonful in his coffee."
5986,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,You ought to have seen the face he made. He didn’t more than half like
5987,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"it, even when I called out ‘April fool!’ I sent George out to pick up"
5988,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,a package of sand I had dropped near the gate. I rang the doorbell and
5989,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"got Ann to go to the door, and there I stood and said ‘April fool.’ I"
5990,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"sent a letter to Louise, and tied mamma’s apron-strings to her chair.”"
5991,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5992,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"Helen listened in amazement, as one girl after another told of such"
5993,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,silly tricks.
5994,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5995,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"At last they turned to her. “Well, Helen, what did you do?”"
5996,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
5997,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Oh! I fooled every one in the family, but I did a lot of new things,”"
5998,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,said Helen.
5999,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6000,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“What were they?” cried the girls, in chorus."
6001,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6002,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Well,” said she, in a low voice, “I got up real early, and crept"
6003,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"softly downstairs and set the table in the dining-room, while Jane"
6004,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,was starting breakfast in the kitchen. She ’most always has it set at
6005,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"night, but mamma and the sewing woman were using the long table to cut"
6006,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"out goods when Jane went to bed. She was hurrying as fast as she could,"
6007,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"and rushed in, and when she saw the table set she threw up both hands,"
6008,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"and said: ‘Well, now, however did that table get set? Was it witches’"
6009,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,work?’
6010,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6011,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,“Then I jumped out from behind the door and cried: ‘April fool!’
6012,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6013,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“‘So it is,’ she said; ‘an’ it’s a fine one you’ve given me; I’ll not"
6014,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,forget it of you.’
6015,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6016,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“After breakfast mamma was just going to get Baby to sleep, and some"
6017,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,one came to see her on business. She asked me to keep him till she
6018,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"could get back. I took him, and rocked and sung to him, and he went"
6019,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"to sleep. I laid him down in his crib, and then hid to see what mamma"
6020,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,would do. I heard her hurrying upstairs and into the room. Then she
6021,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"stopped and stared. I stepped up softly behind her and kissed her, and"
6022,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"said, ‘April fool!’ She thought it was a nice one."
6023,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6024,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,“Uncle Guy came in and asked mamma to mend his glove when she had time.
6025,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,As quick as I could I got my thimble and needle and silk and mended the
6026,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"glove; and when he came in again in a hurry and said: ‘Well, I can’t"
6027,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"wait now for it to be mended,’ he drew it on and said, ‘Why, it is"
6028,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"mended.’ Then I called out, ‘April fool, Uncle Guy!’"
6029,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6030,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“‘O, you little rogue!’ he said; ‘I’ll pay you up.’"
6031,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6032,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Well, then I mended Frank’s sails to his boat when he started to do it"
6033,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"and papa called him away, and”—"
6034,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6035,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,“What did you do for your father?” asked Marjie Day.
6036,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6037,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,“Oh! papa said he must hunt up some papers in the library at
6038,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"lunch-time, so I looked them up and laid them on his plate, and when he"
6039,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"said: ‘Why, how did these get here?’ I said: ‘April fool!’ And that’s"
6040,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"all,” added Helen, with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes."
6041,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6042,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Well!” exclaimed Carrie Andrews, “if that don’t beat the Dutch.”"
6043,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6044,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Wasn’t it a good way?” asked Helen, almost crying."
6045,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6046,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Of course, you little goose! but who else would ever have thought of"

6048,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,
6049,HELEN’S “APRIL FOOL.”,"“Mamma said she didn’t like silly jokes, and said I had better try"

6099,LAURA CREEDMORE.,fourteen acres of floor to walk around in Mr. Wanamaker’s store! The
6100,LAURA CREEDMORE.,different departments are fixed up beautifully. They have lovely
6101,LAURA CREEDMORE.,parlors and dining-rooms and bedrooms all rigged up with beautiful
6102,LAURA CREEDMORE.,"furniture, to show people how to furnish their rooms, and every few"
6103,LAURA CREEDMORE.,days they change and give you another style. But the most interesting
6104,LAURA CREEDMORE.,"part of the store, to me, was the way the money is sent to the"
6105,LAURA CREEDMORE.,cashiers. There are eighty-one pay-stations in the store; then there
6106,LAURA CREEDMORE.,is a central cash desk where twenty-five cashiers are busy all day
6107,LAURA CREEDMORE.,long receiving the money that is brought to them through the tubes.
6108,LAURA CREEDMORE.,"The clerk at a pay-station takes the money you give him, and starts it"
6109,LAURA CREEDMORE.,"in one of the pneumatic tubes, and away it shoots to the central desk"

6129,HENRY W. GILMORE.,let in by a door-keeper. The singing sounds just grand. There is a very
6130,HENRY W. GILMORE.,"large choir, and the organ rolls and rolls. I liked Mr. Conwell almost"
6131,HENRY W. GILMORE.,"better than any minister I ever heard, except my own, of course. Then I"
6132,HENRY W. GILMORE.,went to Sunday-school; hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of children!
6133,HENRY W. GILMORE.,I never saw so many together before. Of course I saw other things in
6134,HENRY W. GILMORE.,"Philadelphia, but what I liked the best was that church. It seemed so"
6135,HENRY W. GILMORE.,"funny to see folks crowding into church on Sunday morning, and to have"
6136,HENRY W. GILMORE.,a big overflow meeting for those who couldn’t get in. Where I live they
6137,HENRY W. GILMORE.,"have to coax the people to come to church, and there’s lots of room"
6138,HENRY W. GILMORE.,always.

6144,FANNY PIERCE.,ONCE I went to “Old Swede’s” Church in Philadelphia. It is very old.
6145,FANNY PIERCE.,There used to be a log church on the place where it stands; sometimes
6146,FANNY PIERCE.,"it was used for a fort. That was in 1677, but about three years"
6147,FANNY PIERCE.,"afterwards the brick church was built, and that is the one I went to."
6148,FANNY PIERCE.,"In the churchyard are many very old graves, and some new ones. Some"
6149,FANNY PIERCE.,of the names on the grave-stones are so old I could not make them
6150,FANNY PIERCE.,out. It seemed very strange to be in a church which was built almost
6151,FANNY PIERCE.,two hundred years ago. Then we went to the queer little old house on
6152,FANNY PIERCE.,Letitia Street where William Penn used to live. Great big buildings
6153,FANNY PIERCE.,"have grown up around it, and they make it look very odd. Then we went"
6154,FANNY PIERCE.,"to the old London Coffee House; I had studied about that in my history,"
6155,FANNY PIERCE.,and I was disgusted to find it turned into a cigar store. It is a very
6156,FANNY PIERCE.,queer old building. I saw the house where the first American flag was
6157,FANNY PIERCE.,made; that is on Arch Street.

6166,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,MY sister Helen has written all about old places and never mentioned

6168,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,there with father and Helen. I think it is one of the grandest places
6169,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,in Philadelphia. It is the “Cradle of American Independence.” That
6170,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,was where the first prayer in Congress was made the morning after
6171,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,Boston was bombarded. Before that some of the people had objected to
6172,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,"having Congress opened with prayer, but after that morning nobody ever"
6173,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,objected again. The inscription on the wall says it was here that
6174,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,"“Henry, Hancock and Adams inspired the Delegates of the Colonies with"
6175,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,Nerve and Sinew for the toils of war.”
6176,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,
6177,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,"Then of course we went to Independence Hall, where the second"

6179,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,on the first Fourth of July. Helen says there was a Fourth of July
6180,HELEN STUART CAMPBELL.,every year before that time; but I mean the first one which was worth

6188,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,If I lived there I should want to stay in the park all summer. The
6189,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,drive out is just as lovely as it can be. We crossed the Girard Avenue
6190,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,"bridge, which is a thousand feet long. You can walk or ride across,"
6191,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,just as you please. There is a sidewalk on each side of the carriage
6192,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,"drive sixteen feet wide, and beautifully paved. The railing around this"
6193,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,"bridge is trimmed with flowers, vines and birds, made in bronze. We saw"
6194,ROBERT STUART CAMPBELL.,the old house which was built by William Penn’s son. And we went to the

6217,PART II.,“WHAT did you say?” This last sentence was addressed to a customer who
6218,PART II.,"had been standing for some seconds. “Green braid? No, we haven’t any to"
6219,PART II.,match that.”
6220,PART II.,
6221,PART II.,“Are you sure?” questioned the young girl anxiously. “Haven’t you a

6223,PART II.,
6224,PART II.,[Illustration: THE LIBERTY BELL.]
6225,PART II.,
6226,PART II.,"“No, we haven’t!” sharp-voiced and spiteful."
6227,PART II.,
6228,PART II.,"“Saucy thing!” she added, as the girl turned away; “I told her I"
6229,PART II.,hadn’t; what business had she to ask again?”
6230,PART II.,
6231,PART II.,"“O, Nellie! I don’t think you are sure. I think I found some in your"
6232,PART II.,upper row of boxes yesterday which would answer for the sample.”
6233,PART II.,
6234,PART II.,“Nonsense! as if you could tell without looking. I know I haven’t; I
6235,PART II.,"tumbled the whole lot over yesterday for a fussy woman, and I remember"
6236,PART II.,"every shade in it. It is of no consequence, anyhow; a seven-cent braid!"
6237,PART II.,
6238,PART II.,"“O, Jean! look here; let me see your photographs. Are they good?”"
6239,PART II.,
6240,PART II.,She had darted away to the counter below.
6241,PART II.,
6242,PART II.,"Marion stood for a moment irresolute, then moved toward the girl. “Let"
6243,PART II.,"me see it, please; I think I can match it.”"
6244,PART II.,
6245,PART II.,The woman to whom she had sold a spool of thread turned at the sound
6246,PART II.,"of her voice and smiled on the girl. “Give it to her, Jennie, she will"
6247,PART II.,"match it; she knows how,” she said. Marion answered the smile; her"
6248,PART II.,heart was warm over the simple words of commendation. She sought among
6249,PART II.,the upper row of boxes for the one which her memory associated with
6250,PART II.,"yesterday’s shades, and found it. The girl made her seven-cent purchase"
6251,PART II.,"and went away pleased, just as Nellie came back from her photographs."
6252,PART II.,
6253,PART II.,“Such a stupid day!” she yawned toward its close. “Not a person of
6254,PART II.,importance has even passed our counter. I’ve sold about a dollar’s
6255,PART II.,worth of goods to-day. How much have you done?”
6256,PART II.,
6257,PART II.,"“Hardly that,” said Marion, smiling. “It has all been spools of cotton"
6258,PART II.,"and darning needles. It has rained, you know, all day.”"
6259,PART II.,
6260,PART II.,"The next morning’s sun shone brightly, and the large store was thronged"
6261,PART II.,"early in the day with shoppers. Both Marion and Nellie were busy, the"
6262,PART II.,latter not much pleasanter than she had been the day before; it all
6263,PART II.,seemed such trivial work to her.
6264,PART II.,
6265,PART II.,“Are you sure you are not mistaken in the name?” one of the chiefs was
6266,PART II.,"saying, in a perplexed tone, to a lady who stood near Marion’s counter."
6267,PART II.,"“We have but one clerk of that name, and she is the youngest in the"
6268,PART II.,store.”
6269,PART II.,
6270,PART II.,"“This one is quite young, and she sells spool cotton,” said the lady,"
6271,PART II.,catching Marion’s eye and smiling a recognition. She had laid aside the
6272,PART II.,"long gossamer, and was carefully dressed. “I have a fancy to be waited"
6273,PART II.,on by her.”
6274,PART II.,
6275,PART II.,"“Marion,” said the chief, turning to her, “this lady wants to look at"
6276,PART II.,the light trimming silks; do you know anything about them?”
6277,PART II.,
6278,PART II.,"“Yes, sir,” said Marion promptly; “I know the shades and prices.”"
6279,PART II.,
6280,PART II.,"“I thought so,” the lady said, and Marion moved down the archway at her"
6281,PART II.,side.
6282,PART II.,
6283,PART II.,"“I have a fancy that you can match silks,” the lady said; “at least I"
6284,PART II.,think you will patiently try. A girl who could do her best on a rainy
6285,PART II.,"day for a spool of cotton, can be depended upon for silk, I believe.”"
6286,PART II.,
6287,PART II.,"From the silk department they went to the glove counter, and from there"
6288,PART II.,"to the millinery, in each of which departments the young girl with"
6289,PART II.,wide-open eyes and deft fingers and careful taste gave satisfaction.
6290,PART II.,"“You ought to be in this room,” said the head milliner, smiling on her"
6291,PART II.,as she saw her select the right shade of velvet. “Where do you belong?”
6292,PART II.,"She laughed when told, and said that the spool-cotton department was"
6293,PART II.,fortunate.
6294,PART II.,
6295,PART II.,"“That Marion Wilkes,” said the chief on Saturday evening, “what about"
6296,PART II.,her?” The clerk told briefly what he knew about her.
6297,PART II.,
6298,PART II.,"“Promote her,” said the chief briefly. “Keep watch of her; if she"
6299,PART II.,"succeeds in other departments as well, keep pushing her. She has been"
6300,PART II.,worth several hundred dollars to us this week. Miss Lamson told me
6301,PART II.,"she had expected to buy her niece’s outfit over at Breck’s, but was"
6302,PART II.,attracted here by that little girl selling her a spool of cotton on a
6303,PART II.,rainy day. And Jennie Packard brought her mother here for the winter
6304,PART II.,"supplies for their family, because that girl matched a dress braid; in"
6305,PART II.,"fact, I have heard half a dozen stories of the kind about her. She is"
6306,PART II.,valuable; we cannot spare her for spool cotton.”
6307,PART II.,
6308,PART II.,"It was four years ago that this true story happened. Last Saturday,"
6309,PART II.,"as I stood near the spool counter in the fashionable store, I heard a"
6310,PART II.,voice ask: “And what has become of Marion Wilkes? She used to be here
6311,PART II.,"next to you, didn’t she, Nellie?”"
6312,PART II.,
6313,PART II.,"“Why, yes, she was the spool-cotton girl; but she didn’t stay here"
6314,PART II.,long; she got to be a favorite with the proprietors somehow. I never
6315,PART II.,understood it. She was a sly little thing; they promoted her all the
6316,PART II.,while; you never saw anything like it. She gets the largest salary of
6317,PART II.,"any saleswoman in the store now, and I heard last week that they were"
6318,PART II.,going to put her at the head of the art department. That’s just the way
6319,PART II.,"with some people, always in luck. Here I have been at this tape and"
6320,PART II.,"braid counter for years, and expect to be until my eyes are too dim to"
6321,PART II.,pick out the stupid things. I told you I had no tape of that width;
6322,PART II.,what is the use in asking again?” This last sentence was addressed to a
6323,PART II.,little girl who was waiting to be served.

6335,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“ISN’T he lovely?” asked Miss Henderson, as we three stood in front of"
6336,THE SPOILED FACE.,"Charlie’s portrait, which had just come from the artist’s hand. “He has"
6337,THE SPOILED FACE.,"such great expressive eyes, so soft, and yet so full of intelligence."
6338,THE SPOILED FACE.,The artist has caught the very expression. I think I never saw a more
6339,THE SPOILED FACE.,beautiful boy.”
6340,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6341,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“I think I never saw a greater nuisance,” said Miss Maylie, speaking"
6342,THE SPOILED FACE.,"with a good deal of energy and with a slight frown on her face, as"
6343,THE SPOILED FACE.,though some unpleasant memory was stirred by the sight of the lovely
6344,THE SPOILED FACE.,face in the frame. We both turned and looked at her in surprise.
6345,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6346,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“Nuisance!” repeated Miss Henderson. “Why, what can you mean? I have"
6347,THE SPOILED FACE.,heard that his character is as lovely as his face. He is one of the
6348,THE SPOILED FACE.,"most generous little fellows, always dividing his goodies with the"
6349,THE SPOILED FACE.,children.”
6350,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6351,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“Oh! I don’t doubt it,” said Miss Maylie; “but there are other traits"
6352,THE SPOILED FACE.,in children to be sought after besides that of dividing their goodies.”
6353,THE SPOILED FACE.,"Then she laughed, as if half-ashamed of the warmth of her manner,"
6354,THE SPOILED FACE.,"and said: “I’ve been a recent victim to one of his habits, and feel"
6355,THE SPOILED FACE.,"somewhat deeply, perhaps. I had an important engagement with his mother"
6356,THE SPOILED FACE.,yesterday—a business matter for which I had asked an interview—and
6357,THE SPOILED FACE.,"told her I was pressed for time, and had but a half-hour. I suppose we"
6358,THE SPOILED FACE.,had been together about two minutes when the door opened without the
6359,THE SPOILED FACE.,"ceremony of a knock, and Charlie appeared to ask if he might go over to"
6360,THE SPOILED FACE.,"Uncle Harry’s. He was told that he could not, it looked too much like"
6361,THE SPOILED FACE.,"rain; and he argued the matter, assuring his mother that the wind had"
6362,THE SPOILED FACE.,changed and was blowing from the west; that the cook said it was not
6363,THE SPOILED FACE.,"going to rain any more; that he would put on his rubbers and bundle up,"
6364,THE SPOILED FACE.,"and I don’t know what else. He was listened to patiently by his mother,"
6365,THE SPOILED FACE.,"and impatiently by me, for my precious half-hour was slipping away. He"
6366,THE SPOILED FACE.,"shut the door at last with a frown on his face which, if it had been"
6367,THE SPOILED FACE.,"painted, would have made this picture much less beautiful, but I am"
6368,THE SPOILED FACE.,afraid more natural.
6369,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6370,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“It was certainly not five minutes before he was back, and this time it"
6371,THE SPOILED FACE.,"was, ‘Mamma, may I call Jerry to bring in the kittens?’"
6372,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6373,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“‘O, no, dear! not this afternoon; you are dressed for dinner, you"
6374,THE SPOILED FACE.,know.’
6375,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6376,THE SPOILED FACE.,“‘That won’t make any difference; I won’t soil my clothes. The kittens
6377,THE SPOILED FACE.,"haven’t been out in the mud. Do, mamma, let me.’"
6378,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6379,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“‘No, Charlie; I do not want them in the parlor, you know.’"
6380,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6381,THE SPOILED FACE.,“‘Then I’ll go to the kitchen and play with them; Jane won’t care.’
6382,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6383,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“‘Yes, Jane cares very much; the kittens annoy her. Charlie will have"
6384,THE SPOILED FACE.,to get along without them this afternoon.’
6385,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6386,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“Another slam to the door, with the scowl deepened. But we were by"
6387,THE SPOILED FACE.,no means to be left in peace. I was just in the midst of the most
6388,THE SPOILED FACE.,"intricate part of my business explanation, when Charlie arrived again."
6389,THE SPOILED FACE.,"Now he was hungry; could not wait another minute, and wanted some"
6390,THE SPOILED FACE.,"bread and butter and syrup, and a piece of cake and a glass of milk."
6391,THE SPOILED FACE.,It was carefully explained to him that dinner would be served within
6392,THE SPOILED FACE.,"the hour, and that syrup was not good for him, the doctor said—to which"
6393,THE SPOILED FACE.,he replied that he did not care what the old doctor said—and that cake
6394,THE SPOILED FACE.,would be given him at the table when it was passed to the others.
6395,THE SPOILED FACE.,To each of these explanations he returned an answer which had to be
6396,THE SPOILED FACE.,"answered, and when all was settled, he began over again to coax for"
6397,THE SPOILED FACE.,something to eat! The fourth time he came he wanted the gas lighted
6398,THE SPOILED FACE.,"in the library, and the fifth he wanted a certain great book which he"
6399,THE SPOILED FACE.,could not lift placed conveniently for him to look at the pictures.
6400,THE SPOILED FACE.,When at last even his mother felt the strain on her patience and told
6401,THE SPOILED FACE.,"him he must run away and not interrupt her again, he burst into a loud"
6402,THE SPOILED FACE.,"howl, and slammed the door after him so that my nerves all shivered at"
6403,THE SPOILED FACE.,the jar.
6404,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6405,THE SPOILED FACE.,“I must say it would be difficult for me to admire his face to-day; my
6406,THE SPOILED FACE.,annoyances are too recent. Seven times during a single half-hour to be
6407,THE SPOILED FACE.,"interrupted by a little boy, when you are trying to transact important"
6408,THE SPOILED FACE.,"business with his mother, has spoiled his face for me. If he had"
6409,THE SPOILED FACE.,"wanted one single thing which it was important to have at that moment,"
6410,THE SPOILED FACE.,it would have made a difference.”
6411,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6412,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“They all seemed important to him, I suppose,” said gentle Miss"
6413,THE SPOILED FACE.,"Henderson, who always tried to apologize for everybody."
6414,THE SPOILED FACE.,
6415,THE SPOILED FACE.,"“Yes, they did,” said Miss Maylie; “that is just the trouble; he"
6416,THE SPOILED FACE.,"evidently considered himself a very important person, and thought that"
6417,THE SPOILED FACE.,his mother should leave her business and her caller and attend to him.
6418,THE SPOILED FACE.,I should call him a spoiled child.”

6509,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6510,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6511,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,NOBODY knew or even dreamed how large a thought was puzzling the brains
6512,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,of little Sadie Wilmot. It had begun at family worship that morning.
6513,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Or no; perhaps it began back of that, at the meeting of “Cheerful"
6514,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Givers,” on Thursday. Mr. Wilmot said it was an absurd idea for such"
6515,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"little dots as Sadie to be going to missionary meeting, but grandmamma"
6516,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"quoted to him: “As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined,” and herself"
6517,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"dressed Sadie for the gathering. Then Miss Harlowe, the leader, had"
6518,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,told a story about a little heathen boy who prayed to an ugly little
6519,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"wooden image, with a hideous face; she showed a model of the little"
6520,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"heathen’s god, and Sadie was shocked and distressed. She thought"
6521,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"about the heathen a good deal that day. Now, this Saturday morning"
6522,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"grandfather, at family worship, had read a Psalm. Sadie had not been"
6523,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"listening very closely; in fact, it was hard for her to listen to Bible"
6524,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"reading, some way, unless it had a story in it. This was not in the"
6525,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"least like a story, and Sadie’s thoughts were, if the truth must be"
6526,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"told, upon her dollie’s new hat and how she should make it, when she"
6527,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"heard these words: “Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for"
6528,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,thine inheritance.” It was that word “heathen” which caught her ear.
6529,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,Who was talking? To whom were the heathen to be given? Had some naughty
6530,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"king given them away to a bad man, and was that why they prayed to ugly"
6531,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,wooden dollies? Sadie’s thoughts were in a turmoil; she could hardly
6532,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"wait until the prayer was over, before she was at grandpapa’s knee"
6533,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,questioning.
6534,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6535,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Why, child,” said grandpapa, with a puzzled air, for he was not used"
6536,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"to explaining the Bible to little people, “it means what it says; the"
6537,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,heathen are to be given to Jesus.”
6538,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6539,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Given to Jesus!” said Sadie, amazed, “then why do they pray to ugly"
6540,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,wooden dollies?”
6541,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6542,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,“Because He hasn’t got them yet; they don’t know they belong to him.”
6543,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6544,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,“Why doesn’t somebody tell them?”
6545,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6546,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,“They do. People are at work telling them. Did you never hear about the
6547,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"missionaries, child? I thought you belonged to a Mission Band?”"
6548,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6549,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Of course she did, and had heard about missionaries, and assured her"
6550,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,grandfather that she gave five cents a month to support them. He did
6551,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,not say that that was a larger sum than he gave regularly for the same
6552,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,purpose; for some reason he did not care to do so; he only said:
6553,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6554,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Very well, then, you understand all about it. The Bible says the"
6555,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"heathen will be given to Jesus, and the missionaries have gone over"
6556,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"there to tell them about it, and show them how to serve the Lord.”"
6557,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6558,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Has every single one of them heard it?” questioned Sadie, in great"
6559,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,earnestness.
6560,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6561,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Well, no,” said grandfather; “I believe they haven’t yet.”"
6562,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6563,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Why don’t they do it faster? Why don’t lots more missionaries go, and"
6564,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"take Bibles, and hurry? Because maybe some of them will die before they"
6565,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,hear it.”
6566,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6567,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Sadie was in intense earnest, but her father laughed, and said: “That’s"
6568,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"the question, father. Puts some of you Christians in a tight place,"
6569,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,doesn’t it?”
6570,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6571,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,Sadie could not imagine what he meant; her grandfather sat at ease in
6572,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"his big leather-covered chair, and was not in a tight place at all."
6573,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,But she was disappointed at his telling her to run away and not ask
6574,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"any more questions for five minutes. If she only had a mamma, Sadie"
6575,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"thought, she would ask her all the questions she pleased, for her"
6576,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,friend Trudie Brown said that mammas never got tired of answering. But
6577,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,Sadie’s mamma went to heaven when she was a wee baby.
6578,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6579,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"She went away to think it over, as she had to do with so many of"
6580,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"her puzzles, only to have it added to presently by words from her"
6581,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,grandmother.
6582,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6583,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“I declare!” said that good woman, coming in from the back yard, where"
6584,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"she had been talking to Tony, the errand-boy, “that boy is a perfect"
6585,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,heathen.”
6586,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6587,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Sadie nearly dropped her dollie with a china head on the floor, in her"
6588,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"dismay. “Is he truly, Grandma?” she asked."
6589,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6590,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Yes, he is,” said grandmamma, with emphasis; “I don’t believe there is"
6591,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,a greater heathen in the depths of Africa than Tony. I have been trying
6592,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"to explain the simplest matter to him, and he does not understand me as"
6593,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,well as a child of three ought to.”
6594,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6595,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“How should he?” asked grandfather, to whom this sentence was chiefly"
6596,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,addressed; “he has never had any chance to learn. The whole settlement
6597,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"over there where he came from live like heathen, and know no better.”"
6598,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6599,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Then came one of Sadie’s startling questions: “Grandfather, is he one"
6600,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,of those who were given to Jesus?”
6601,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6602,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,[Illustration: THINKING IT OVER.]
6603,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6604,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“What?” asked grandfather, in astonishment. He had already forgotten"
6605,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,the morning’s questions.
6606,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6607,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Why, isn’t he one that you read about, out of the Bible, that was"
6608,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,given to Jesus?”
6609,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6610,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Oh!” said grandfather, “I suppose so; why, yes, child, certainly."
6611,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Jesus came to save him, as well as other heathen.”"
6612,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6613,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,“Does he know it?”
6614,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6615,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,“What a child you are!” said grandmother; but as this was no answer
6616,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Sadie waited, looking at her grandfather."
6617,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6618,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“I doubt if he does,” he said at last, “or would understand if he was"
6619,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,told.”
6620,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6621,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Why, then he ought to be told over and over, ever so many times, as"
6622,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,you said you had to do with Bruce before he understood that he was to
6623,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"stand on his hind feet and ask for a bone, oughtn’t he?”"
6624,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6625,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"Both grandfather and grandmother began to laugh, though Sadie had no"
6626,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,knowledge of what there was to laugh about; she was often treated in
6627,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"this way, and did not understand it. She turned away with a dignified"
6628,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"air, a trifle hurt that her logic should produce only laughter; but"
6629,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,there was decision as well as dignity in the tone in which she said: “I
6630,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,mean to tell him.”
6631,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6632,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"That was the beginning of effort for Tony Black, as he was called for"
6633,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"convenience, though his full name was Antony Blackwell."
6634,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6635,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,Faithfully did Sadie pour information on him and ply him with questions
6636,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"until, from staring and being stupidly amused, and then half-vexed with"
6637,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"her, he at last became interested, and listened and asked questions"
6638,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"himself, and began to think. “Sadie’s heathen,” he was familiarly"
6639,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"called by certain amused friends, who were told the story."
6640,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,
6641,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,He was called so long after the name had ceased to fit him; for this
6642,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,is a true story of something which happened years ago. The years went
6643,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"by, and Tony Black became so utterly changed that people forgot that"
6644,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"they had ever called him heathen, or even Tony. “Young Blackwell”"
6645,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"was the name by which he began to be known; then, after a time,"
6646,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“Mr. Blackwell.” And one evening, when there was a great meeting in"
6647,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"one of the largest churches of a certain city, he was introduced as"
6648,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"“The Rev. Mr. Blackwell, who is under appointment to go to Africa"
6649,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,as a missionary.” Who do you think went with him? Sadie herself! He
6650,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,told on the platform something of his story; of the time when he was
6651,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"called “Sadie’s heathen,” and of his joy and pride in having the name"
6652,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,"altered, until now, by her friends, he was called “Sadie’s minister.”"
6653,SADIE’S “HEATHEN.”,But by mere acquaintances they were spoken of as Rev. and Mrs. Antony

6666,QUEER CREATURES.,you see. The way of it was that one of the crocodiles was sleeping—or
6667,QUEER CREATURES.,"pretending to sleep—on the bank of the river, when along came a"
6668,QUEER CREATURES.,"careless little monkey, and his eyes were not where they should have"
6669,QUEER CREATURES.,"been, or they did not look sharply at this thing that seemed to be but"
6670,QUEER CREATURES.,"a log; when, before he knew what he was about, this “log” opened his"
6671,QUEER CREATURES.,"big mouth, and with a sudden flap of his tail, in went the thoughtless"
6672,QUEER CREATURES.,monkey. That was the end of that young monkey. That’s about the way the

6677,QUEER CREATURES.,"She was mad as—“a setting hen.” She shouted at the top of her voice,"

6680,QUEER CREATURES.,matter; so they all set up such a hue and cry as you never heard. They
6681,QUEER CREATURES.,"scolded and insulted the crocodile, and twitched their faces and shook"
6682,QUEER CREATURES.,"their fists at him, and jabbered such a bedlam that all the crocodiles"
6683,QUEER CREATURES.,ran together to see what was to pay. Upon the bank out of the water
6684,QUEER CREATURES.,"they climbed, and with open mouths and loud hisses, hurried after the"
6685,QUEER CREATURES.,scampering monkeys; but those spry creatures bounded up that big high
6686,QUEER CREATURES.,"tree, and from the lofty limbs looked down and scolded with all their"
6687,QUEER CREATURES.,"might and main, and again shook their fists and snapped their long"
6688,QUEER CREATURES.,finger-nails to show how they would tear every hair out of the crock’s
6689,QUEER CREATURES.,hide if they could get a chance—if there were any hair.
6690,QUEER CREATURES.,

6826,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6827,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6828,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,ABOUT three hundred years ago England’s great queen died. She was not
6829,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"very beautiful. Some said this was a great trial to her, and that she"
6830,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,took marvelous pains to “fix” herself up to look as well as any lady
6831,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"in the land. Fine feathers often make pretty birds, but all Queen"
6832,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"Bess’ efforts failed to make her handsome. However, as she had royal"
6833,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"power she had many admirers. They called her “charming,” “lovely,”"
6834,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"“lily,” “rose,” and such other words to flatter her. She liked it,"
6835,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,and persuaded herself that after all her features and complexion were
6836,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,nearly exquisite.
6837,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6838,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,However that be she had not a few offers of marriage. But none suited
6839,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"her, or may be she, as a queen, did not want to be bothered with a"
6840,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"husband, who would be continually interfering in the government."
6841,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6842,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,It is sad to think of some things this woman did. Of course you will
6843,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,read about it. Sometimes she would have outbursts of anger so great
6844,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"that she would actually box the ears of those around her, no matter how"
6845,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,distinguished they were.
6846,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6847,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"The great stain upon her character was her treatment of Mary, Queen of"
6848,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"Scots, her own relative. Mary was imprisoned eighteen years, then put"
6849,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,to death on charge of conspiracy.
6850,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,
6851,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,But England arose to extraordinary prosperity under the long reign of
6852,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,"“Queen Bess.” There were great scholars in her day, and she encouraged"
6853,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,all sorts of improvements. You Pansy girls must some day dress your P.
6854,QUEEN ELIZABETH.,S. President up in the Elizabethan style and say if you would like it

6880,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6881,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6882,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"THE thought grew in Elsie’s mind, nourished by three remarks made by"
6883,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"her mother and sisters. They were all at work except Irma, who was"
6884,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"trying to teach Leoline to jump gracefully from her shoulder, instead"
6885,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,of giving such a rude bound. Leoline was the cat. Irma was not apt to
6886,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"be at work, if the truth must be told; she was the only one of the"
6887,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,little household who did not seem to understand the need for being
6888,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"industrious. She was two years older than Elsie, but the grown-up"
6889,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,sisters often said of her that Elsie was at least three years ahead
6890,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,of Irma in judgment. I have sometimes thought if they had said in
6891,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,conscientiousness it would have been nearer the truth.
6892,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6893,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"At this particular time, while Irma struggled with the cat’s education,"
6894,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Elsie took neat stitches in the apron she was mending, her face looking"
6895,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"thoughtful the while. Margaret, the oldest sister, was sewing swiftly"
6896,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"on a dress of Irma’s, setting in new sleeves, and in other ways trying"
6897,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"to make the half-worn garment look like a new one. Nannie came in,"
6898,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"dustpan in hand, and with a handkerchief bound about her hair to"
6899,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"protect it from the dust, just as her mother opened the door of the"
6900,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"kitchen, with her hands filled with soiled napkins and towels."
6901,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6902,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“Mother, where can I put that roll of matting?” Nannie asked, a touch"
6903,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,of irritation in her voice; “I have reached the end of my resources in
6904,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,tucking things away. If I ever do build a house I will have all the
6905,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"closets I want; good-sized ones, too—and if there is any space left for"
6906,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"rooms, there may be a few tucked in; but the closets I will have.”"
6907,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6908,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Mrs. Harding sighed. “Closets are certainly very scarce in this house,”"
6909,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"she said wearily, “as well as many other things. I don’t know what to"
6910,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,do with the soiled clothes; we need a clothes hamper very much. There
6911,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"is a corner in the upper back hall where one might stand, if we had"
6912,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"it.” The sentence ended as it had begun, with a little sigh."
6913,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6914,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Irma echoed the sigh in a sort of groan. “I saw such a pretty one,"
6915,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"mother, last night, at Turner’s. It was only two dollars; I thought of"
6916,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,you when I saw them unpacking it. And to think that we cannot afford
6917,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,even two dollars for a basket!”
6918,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6919,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“There are worse trials in life than even that, I suspect,” said"
6920,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Nannie, darting an angry glance at Irma, as she saw the flush spread"
6921,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,and deepen over her mother’s face. Margaret made haste to change the
6922,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,subject.
6923,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6924,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“We each have our perplexities, it seems,” she said, with a light"
6925,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,laugh; “mine has to do with dress. I don’t know what to do with that
6926,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"light sateen of mine; it is too gay to wear about the house at work,"
6927,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"even if it were long enough, which it isn’t. It is not worth giving"
6928,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"away, it is too good to throw into the rag bag, and there isn’t room"
6929,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,for it in my closet. Now what is to be done in such a case?”
6930,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6931,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Then Elsie spoke for the first time, eagerly, a bright look flashing"
6932,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"over her face, as though some perplexity had just then been"
6933,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"delightfully solved. “O, Margaret! will you give the dress to me to do"
6934,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,just what I please with?”
6935,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6936,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“To you, child! what can you do with it? It isn’t just the thing for a"
6937,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"dollie, I should say.”"
6938,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6939,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“No,” said Irma scornfully, “I should think not. Do let us have our"
6940,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"dolls dressed in good taste and decent style, even if we cannot afford"
6941,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,anything for ourselves.”
6942,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6943,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“I don’t want it for my doll, Margaret. I have a plan, a real nice one,"
6944,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"if you will let me have the dress, and if mother will give me the"
6945,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"matting Nannie cannot find a place for. Will you, mother? There is only"
6946,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,a little of it left.”
6947,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6948,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“Is it the yellow plaid, Nannie? Why, yes, dear, if there is any"
6949,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"pleasure to be gotten out of that yard and a half of cheap matting, by"
6950,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,all means use it; especially since there is no place to store it.”
6951,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6952,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Then Mrs. Harding left the room, giving Nannie a chance to say what she"
6953,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,was longing to.
6954,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6955,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“I never saw such a girl as you are, Irma; you omit no opportunity"
6956,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,to remind mother of our poverty. Even so trivial a thing as a soiled
6957,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,clothes hamper must draw from you a woe-begone sigh. Why can’t you
6958,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"remember that it is hard enough for mother, at the best, without trying"
6959,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,to keep the thought of our troubles ever before her?”
6960,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6961,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“Why, dear me!” said Irma, “what did I say? Mother knew before I spoke"
6962,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,of it that we could not afford even two dollars to buy a clothes
6963,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,hamper. I don’t think she is very likely to forget that we have lost
6964,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,our money.”
6965,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6966,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“Not if you are around,” answered Nannie angrily. “I think you are a"
6967,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"selfish girl; you do nothing but groan and regret, for your share."
6968,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Well, I can’t help it,” she added, in answer to Margaret’s warning"
6969,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,look; “that child’s selfish frettings do try me so!”
6970,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6971,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“We must not expect old heads on young shoulders, remember,” Margaret"
6972,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"said gently, as Irma put Leoline down with a decided bounce, and"
6973,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"slammed the door the least bit after her, as she left the room."
6974,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6975,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“It is the contrast that makes one notice it so,” answered Nannie, with"
6976,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,a significant nod of her head toward Elsie. But Elsie neither heard the
6977,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"words, nor saw the nod; her mind was busy elsewhere."
6978,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6979,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“O, Margaret!” she said eagerly, “I have the loveliest plan. You"
6980,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"know to-morrow will be mother’s birthday, and I was all the evening"
6981,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"wondering what I could give her; now I know. Nannie, I will take the"
6982,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,matting out of your way. I mean to make a clothes hamper for mother out
6983,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,of that and Margaret’s dress.”
6984,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6985,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"Nannie laughed outright, and even Margaret smiled as she said: “Why,"
6986,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"dear child, how can you? I am afraid that is a very large undertaking.”"
6987,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6988,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“No,” said Elsie positively; “I see just how I can do it. The plan"
6989,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,flashed into my mind as soon as you and Nannie began to talk about the
6990,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,two things in the way. I almost know I can do it. If you will help to
6991,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"keep mother away from our room this afternoon, and she won’t give me"
6992,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"anything special to do, I can make it and have it ready for to-morrow"
6993,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,morning. I know just how to go to work.”
6994,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
6995,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"“Let her try it,” said Nannie, with a wise nod of her head. “The child"
6996,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,will make something; I never knew her to fail when she had undertaken
6997,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"to do a thing, and mother’s birthday ought to be noticed in some"
6998,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"way, even though we cannot do as we used. I’m going to fix over her"
6999,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,sewing-chair; I believe in useful presents myself. We will agree to
7000,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"keep mother in order, Elsie, and the sooner the matting disappears from"
7001,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,the front hall the better.”
7002,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,
7003,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,So the little room occupied by the two younger girls was locked all the
7004,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"afternoon, while Elsie worked steadily, and Irma lounged on the bed"
7005,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"with a book, encouraging her sister occasionally with: “You never can"
7006,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,"do it in the world, Elsie Harding! I don’t see any sense in trying. For"
7007,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,my part I would rather give her no present than a bungling thing like
7008,ELSIE’S PLAN.—I.,that. You can’t sew matting decently; it ravels so.”

7078,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,it cost more than six hundred thousand dollars. Peter Cooper built it
7079,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,about thirty-five years ago; and then he gave three hundred thousand
7080,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,dollars to keep the free library going which belongs to it. They have
7081,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,"all sorts of schools in the building. You can learn how to telegraph,"
7082,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,"and to write on the type-writer, and how to draw and paint. My mother"
7083,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,"was in the painting school, and she paints beautifully. We went up to"
7084,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,the reading-room; it is on the third floor; there are rows and rows and
7085,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,rows of books! It makes me dizzy to think of so many. The books are all
7086,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,"covered, so they don’t look very pretty. There are long tables and lots"
7087,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,"of chairs; you are given a check made of brass, or tin, or something,"
7088,DAVID G. DUNLAP.,when you go into the room; then if you want a book or magazine you go

7143,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"LAURA has written a letter about Central Park, and hasn’t mentioned"
7144,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"the obelisk. Ho, ho! if that isn’t just like a girl. I have studied up"
7145,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,about it since I was there. They had an awful time bringing it over
7146,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,here from Egypt. They had to cut a hole in the bow of the boat that
7147,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"brought it to get it in; and then mend the hole, of course, before they"
7148,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,could start. And when the steamer reached New York it took thirty-two
7149,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,horses to draw just the pedestal down to Central Park!

7153,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"The carvings on the obelisk are called hieroglyphics, and used to mean"
7154,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,writing; but scholars have had a great time trying to find out what the
7155,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"writing says. They don’t agree about it, but they think it is a lot of"
7156,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,stuff about some heathen gods. There are carved hawks on the top of the
7157,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"column, and these are said to be the birds that belonged to one of the"
7158,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"gods, because they could fly the highest and could look at the sun."
7159,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,"The obelisk is sixty-nine feet high, and it weighs three hundred and"
7160,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,twenty tons. I don’t exactly see what we wanted of it; but it is rather
7161,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,nice to look at it and think it came all the way from Egypt and was
7162,LAURA J. WESTOVER.,presented to us by Ismail Pasha.

7168,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,THE nicest ride I had while in New York was along Fifth Avenue. We
7169,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,started at Washington Square and went up to Central Park. It is
7170,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"almost three miles, and all the way there were such beautiful houses"
7171,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"and churches to look at, and the road was as smooth as the floor. We"
7172,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,passed the white marble house built by A. T. Stewart; it cost three
7173,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"million dollars, and the people who now rent it pay thirty-seven"
7174,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,thousand dollars a year for it. Only think! and we get three hundred a
7175,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"year for our house, and call it a good rent; but then, it didn’t cost"
7176,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"three millions. Then we passed the elegant Vanderbilt houses, and the"
7177,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"magnificent Lenox Library building, and O, dear! I can’t think what"
7178,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"others. I thought I knew a great deal about them when I began, but"
7179,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,"they are all mixed up in my mind. But what I wanted to say was, that"
7180,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,the drive from Washington Square away up to Eighty-first Street must
7181,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,certainly be the very splendidest in the world. I know I never saw so
7182,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,many beautiful buildings before; and I do like grand houses and grand
7183,REUBEN T. WESTOVER.,churches and everything.

7279,III.,I am so thankful we have a master of another kind.
7280,III.,
7281,III.,One of you run and bring some of that supper that was left.
7282,III.,
7283,III.,"We had a very nice supply this evening, and there is enough for two"
7284,III.,hungry fellows yet.
7285,III.,
7286,III.,"You just say no more till you have had the meat from that bone, and"
7287,III.,see if you don’t feel better. Things hurt worse when one is tired and
7288,III.,hungry.
7289,III.,
7290,III.,"There, now rest a while, and I will tell you a story about a"
7291,III.,"great-uncle of mine, who lived in Groton."
7292,III.,
7293,III.,"He was pretty well educated, and did a great many things that some of"
7294,III.,"his four-footed friends would not be trusted to do, even if they knew"
7295,III.,enough.
7296,III.,
7297,III.,"Well, Diamond—that was his name—was pretty good-natured, but a little"
7298,III.,"sensitive. Being very affectionate, it was easy for those whom he loved"
7299,III.,to hurt his feelings.
7300,III.,
7301,III.,"His master was a mechanic, and had to go to his shop every day. The"
7302,III.,distance was so great that he did not come home to dinner; so his wife
7303,III.,"would prepare his dinner, put it in a pail, or in a basket, as it might"
7304,III.,"happen, lay in the bottom a nice bone for Diamond, and give it all to"
7305,III.,him to take to his master. That he would do as faithfully as any one.
7306,III.,
7307,III.,"When the master had finished eating what had been brought, or as much"
7308,III.,"as he wanted, he would take the bone, and any scraps left, and give"
7309,III.,"them to his faithful carrier, who had been, the while, lying under the"
7310,III.,"bench, patiently waiting."
7311,III.,
7312,III.,But one day there was a break. The mistress said she was going shopping
7313,III.,"that day, and would take the dinner to her husband herself."
7314,III.,
7315,III.,"That rather hurt Diamond’s feelings, though he said nothing, but"
7316,III.,"followed on, and lay down in his usual place to wait for his bone. The"
7317,III.,master sat down to his dinner with no word for his faithful servant who
7318,III.,"was not permitted to bring the basket, finished his meal, closed the"
7319,III.,"basket, and handed it to his wife."
7320,III.,
7321,III.,"No bone was there, nothing for the one who had been waiting, hungry,"
7322,III.,but patient. The only notice taken of him was a call to follow the lady
7323,III.,and carry the empty basket. With a heavy heart and drooping tail he
7324,III.,"obeyed. When the purchases were made and put into the basket, Diamond"
7325,III.,was ordered to go ahead of his mistress and take the burden home.
7326,III.,
7327,III.,"On he trudged until he neared a bridge which they must cross, when a"
7328,III.,"thought came suddenly into Diamond’s mind, and quickly darting forward"
7329,III.,"to the middle of the bridge he went to one side of it, and deliberately"
7330,III.,let the basket and its contents fall into the stream; then ran for home
7331,III.,as fast as his four legs could carry him.
7332,III.,
7333,III.,"I am not telling you this because I think he did right, but that you"
7334,III.,may see that others are treated as badly as you have been.
7335,III.,
7336,III.,I suppose I am sorry that a relative of mine ever resorted to revenge;
7337,III.,but it does sometimes seem very strange to me that more dogs do not
7338,III.,revenge themselves in some way for the hard treatment they so often
7339,III.,receive.
7340,III.,
7341,III.,You would not like to be guilty of such an act as that?
7342,III.,
7343,III.,"Well, I am glad of it. Indeed, I think my kinsman was soon sorry for"
7344,III.,what he had done.
7345,III.,
7346,III.,Let me tell you how he proved it. His master had been out nearly all
7347,III.,day with Diamond hunting. The next morning he discovered that he had
7348,III.,"somewhere lost a key. So he showed Diamond another, and told him his"
7349,III.,"trouble, and ordered him to go and hunt for it."
7350,III.,
7351,III.,"Off he went, and at three o’clock that afternoon returned, bringing the"
7352,III.,lost key.
7353,III.,
7354,III.,"He was tired and hungry, but a good dinner was ready for him, and kind"
7355,III.,words soon made him forget his fatigue.
7356,III.,
7357,III.,"In fact, I believe both master and dog were ashamed and sorry for the"
7358,III.,"past, and inwardly determined to do right in the future."
7359,III.,
7360,III.,"Now after these true stories of my great-uncle, I hope you feel better,"
7361,III.,"and will go home, not to plan how you can be revenged, but how you can"
7362,III.,"be true and faithful, and, if possible, win better treatment in future."

7378,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,SOMEBODY in one of our exchanges tells an amusing story of his attempt
7379,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,at studying human nature in the barnyard. He placed a large piece
7380,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"of looking-glass against the trunk of a tree, and scattered corn in"
7381,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"front of it, then took a convenient position and watched. Some of the"
7382,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"hens came up with cautious tread, to meet what they supposed were new"
7383,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"acquaintances, and were simply astonished and bewildered by the result."
7384,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"Others pecked at the glass, and were anxious to get up a fight with the"

7387,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,The high-stepping rooster was bent on a victory. He advanced with

7389,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,lose sight of his enemy. Of course he had stepped too far to the left
7390,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"or right, and so gotten out of range of the glass, but this he did not"
7391,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"understand. He gave an astonished crow, looked about him fiercely,"
7392,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"saw no one, finally gave up and went back for a kernel of corn;"
7393,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"behold, just in front of it was that other rooster, looking fierce."
7394,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"He made another attempt for a fight, with exactly the same result as"
7395,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,before; but the second surrender to mystery brought him quite near to
7396,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"the mirror and his enemy. He ruffled his feathers, so did the other"
7397,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"rooster. He made a dash forward, so did the other, and—the rooster was"
7398,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,astonished; but you are prepared to hear that the mirror was broken
7399,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,into bits. The question which seemed to puzzle that rooster for hours
7400,BARNYARD ILLUSIONS.,"afterwards was, What became of his enemy, that he could not find even a"

7489,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,
7490,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,MANY hundred years ago there were two magnificent cities on opposite
7491,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,sides of the Mediterranean Sea. One was Carthage and the other was
7492,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"Rome. But they were jealous of each other, and shook their fists at"
7493,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"each other and went to war, each trying to do the other all the harm it"
7494,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,was possible.
7495,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,
7496,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,In Carthage was a man by the name of Hannibal. He hated Rome bitterly.
7497,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,
7498,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"A little before his death he took his son out to the altar, where they"

7502,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"It was an awful thing for any one to do, but how dreadful for a dying"

7505,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,
7506,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,The old man died. When young Hannibal was now twenty-four he was made
7507,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"commander of the troops, and, dressed in a coat of armor, he started"
7508,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"from Carthage with a mighty army. Away he marched toward Spain,"
7509,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"conquering and slaying his enemies on the way. On and on he went, over"

7511,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"in Spain, laughed at the thought of his coming to Rome; they said none"

7517,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"fort. Mighty armies went out to meet Hannibal, but one after another"
7518,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,was slaughtered or put to flight. In one of the great battles forty

7521,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,"The Roman general, Fabius, was a great man, but he was compelled to"

7525,HANNIBAL’S VOW.,he must hurry home with his army and save Carthage from a Roman army

7539,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,"FIVE hundred years ago began very troublous times in England, and it"

7542,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,"out at the ballot box, with bits of paper upon which names are printed."
7543,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,The man or party which gets the greater number of ballots rules. In

7545,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,strike the harder blows ruled.
7546,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,
7547,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,The names of these two great parties were York and Lancaster. The
7548,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,"Yorkers wore the white rose, the Lancastrians the red rose, so it was"

7561,THE WAR OF THE ROSES.,just as in America a man wants to be president. Richard the Third

7878,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7879,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“O, dear, how provoking! No, ma’am, I can’t say I am in the least"
7880,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,prepared for it.”
7881,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7882,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"The mother arose and moved toward the music-room. “Why, dear child!”"
7883,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"she said, in surprise, “you ought not to have that dress on to-night."
7884,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,Even if it were not a rainy evening it is not suitable to wear to a
7885,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,rehearsal.”
7886,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7887,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“Why not, pray? ever so many people come to the rehearsals. I want to"
7888,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,be as well dressed as I am on Sunday.”
7889,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7890,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“My dear, that is a pretty evening dress, and the rain will spot it,"
7891,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"you know. You would have to wear your gossamer, and that would crush"
7892,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"the trimmings. Besides, it doesn’t look at all suitable for this"
7893,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,evening. If you were going out to a social gathering you could not
7894,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"dress more than that. Do go and change it, dear; it won’t take you"
7895,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,long.”
7896,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7897,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“I assure you, mamma, it is quite out of the question that I should"
7898,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,change my dress now. It is already late; you just said I ought to be
7899,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"going. It was quite a work of art to get this dress on, and I haven’t"
7900,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,the least desire to change it; I am not at all afraid of it.”
7901,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7902,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“But, my dear child, just consider how unsuitable it is. Those laces"
7903,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"at the neck and wrists are real, you know, and as fine as cobwebs;"
7904,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,you certainly could not dress more than that if you were going to a
7905,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,reception.”
7906,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7907,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“O, mamma! how absurd. As though anybody would take notice of me, or"
7908,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"care whether my laces were real or not. They fit the dress, any way,"
7909,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,and as long as I don’t object to them I don’t see why anybody else
7910,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,should.”
7911,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7912,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“My daughter, your mother objects to them. Moreover, the dress is lower"
7913,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"in the neck than you have been wearing all day, and it is quite a cool"
7914,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,evening; that in itself should be sufficient to make you change it. I
7915,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,really must insist on your putting on a more proper dress.”
7916,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7917,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,Angie’s pretty fingers came down upon the keys with a crash which
7918,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,made me start in my chair; then she whirled herself about on the
7919,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"music-stool. “Really, mamma,” she said, and the voice was so sharp it"
7920,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,hardly seemed possible that it could be the same which had filled the
7921,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"room with melody, “I should think I was old enough to decide what dress"
7922,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"to wear; I am almost fifteen, and I think I might have the privilege of"
7923,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,choosing my own clothes once in a while.”
7924,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7925,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“Do not speak in that tone, dear,” said her mother gently. “You shall"
7926,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,have all the privileges I can give you; but we haven’t time to discuss
7927,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"it now. Run and slip on your gray cashmere, it is in order; I fixed"
7928,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"that place in the sleeve this morning, and brushed it and got it all"
7929,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,ready to put on.”
7930,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7931,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,“Mamma Conran! that old gray cashmere. As if I would go out in it
7932,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"to-night! Why, the Barnards come to rehearsal, and the Needhams, and"
7933,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,their cousin from New York. The idea of rigging up in that old thing
7934,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"and standing out there to sing, the most prominent person in the choir."
7935,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,I just can’t do it! If I can’t wear the dress I have on I’m not going
7936,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,at all.”
7937,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7938,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“My daughter, don’t be so foolish; the rehearsal surely doesn’t depend"
7939,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,upon the dress you wear. You are wasting time; I cannot think of
7940,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,letting you go in that dress. If I had noticed it before I should have
7941,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,called your attention to it; but I hadn’t the least idea you would
7942,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"think of putting it on. The gray cashmere is entirely suitable, my"
7943,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"dear. Your mother has not lost all sense of propriety, even though she"
7944,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,is older than fifteen. You must allow yourself to be guided by her. I
7945,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"would not make a scene if I were you, and spoil the beauty of the music"
7946,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,you have given us. There is ample time just to slip on another dress.
7947,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"Run along, and I will get out your wraps and have them ready for you"
7948,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,when you come down.”
7949,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7950,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"“Mamma, I’m not going to do it. I told you if I had to wear that old"
7951,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"cashmere dress I shouldn’t go out of the house to-night, and I meant"
7952,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,it. Other girls can wear decent dresses. Carrie Wheeler wears a white
7953,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"silk to rehearsal often, and here I have got to rig up like an old"
7954,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"woman and sing the leading part. You don’t know anything about it,"
7955,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,mamma; it is so long since you were a girl you don’t realize how girls
7956,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,dress now. I wouldn’t hurt this dress and you know it. It is just too
7957,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,mean for anything. You always spoil my pleasure.”
7958,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7959,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,“Angeline!”—the mother’s gentle voice was growing stern at last—“I
7960,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,cannot allow you to speak to your mother in that way. There are the
7961,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"Wheeler girls coming up the walk now, to call for you. If you will go"
7962,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,immediately and change your dress I will explain to them that you will
7963,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,be down in a few minutes.”
7964,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,
7965,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"A loud, angry cry from Angie, a sound like that from a naughty child"
7966,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"who had lost all control of herself, and between the sobs she managed"
7967,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"to get out: “I won’t go a single step, and you can tell them so; and"
7968,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"you can tell them the reason, if you choose; then they will understand"
7969,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,just what hard times I have.” And with another jarring crash of the
7970,ANGIE’S CROSS.—I.,"keys the angry girl left the room, slamming the door after her."

7987,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
7988,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“I’M going to stop its raveling,” said Elsie serenely. “I’m going"
7989,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"to overcast it, as mother does dress seams, and then line it with"
7990,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"Margaret’s dress skirt; that is real strong, and will make it stand up"
7991,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,beautifully.”
7992,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
7993,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"Sure enough, by dint of patient, painstaking effort, a circle of"
7994,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"matting measuring nearly a yard around was cut off, the raw edges"
7995,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“overcast” with a large needle and strong linen thread, then the dress"
7996,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"skirt was ripped and carefully smoothed. A journey to the kitchen,"
7997,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"where Mrs. Hobbs, the woman who washed and ironed on the same day for"
7998,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"this fallen family, was at work. Elsie hinted that it would save her"
7999,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"time if Irma would see to the ironing, but at that moment Irma was in"
8000,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"the depths of her book, and seemed to be deaf. Back again with her"
8001,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"ironed skirt, the yard of matting was laid on the floor, the cloth"
8002,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,spread over it and neatly tacked at sides and ends; then the long side
8003,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"seam was sewed, amid statements from Irma that it could not be done,"
8004,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,because whose arms could be expected to reach down such a ridiculous
8005,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,cylinder as that to sew! It was hard work. Twice Elsie gave up with a
8006,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"sigh, and once was on the point of going to Margaret for advice, but"
8007,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"the strong desire to do the work herself held her, and she actually did"
8008,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"accomplish it! To stand the cylinder on one end, and draw with white"
8009,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"chalk a “head” for it, and then another a trifle larger for a cover,"
8010,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,was comparatively easy. These two were lined by cutting out a circle
8011,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"of cloth three inches larger than the matting circle, running a strong"
8012,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"gathering string around the edge, and drawing it up around the matting."
8013,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8014,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,“What is the use of that?” Irma demanded; and upon being informed that
8015,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"it was for strength and also to give something substantial to sew to,"
8016,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"she said, with a little sniff, “Such a lot of trouble for what will"
8017,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,only be an ugly bungle when you get it done.”
8018,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8019,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“It will be a bungle that will hold the clothes nicely,” Elsie said"
8020,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,merrily.
8021,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8022,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,She was so sure now of succeeding that she could afford to be merry.
8023,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8024,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"The small patient fingers sewed away, and Irma, watching, grew"
8025,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,interested in spite of herself. “You are not making a true round for
8026,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"the cover,” she presently exclaimed. “The thing wiggles in and out so,"
8027,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,it is hard to make a true circle; you ought to cut a paper pattern
8028,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"first, and work at it until you get it true, then cut the matting by"
8029,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"it. Here, I’ll make a pattern for you; and if I were you I would wire"
8030,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,the creature around the top; that would make it stay in place.”
8031,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8032,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“That is an excellent idea,” Elsie said, “and I know just where there"
8033,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,is a bit of wire that will do; I’ll run and get it.” She smothered a
8034,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"wee sigh as she went; it was a good plan to cut a pattern, and Irma’s"
8035,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"eye for cutting was better than her own, but she had wanted to do this"
8036,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"work entirely herself. The pattern was troublesome, but at last a fair"
8037,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"circle was made, an edge of matting four inches deep sewed around it,"
8038,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"the whole carefully lined, and the thing was done."
8039,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8040,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“It really looks very well,” Irma said, “and will do to stand in the"
8041,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,back hall. That wire around the top was a good scheme.”
8042,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8043,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“Yes,” said Elsie heartily, “it was.”"
8044,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8045,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,Mrs. Harding gave no faint praise the next morning when the matting
8046,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“hamper,” duly addressed and wrapped, stood close to her seat at table."
8047,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"She examined the workmanship most minutely, declared that the idea was"
8048,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"original, and the completed work most useful."
8049,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8050,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,“You have no idea how much more precious it is to me than anything
8051,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"bought with money could possibly be,” she said, kissing again the rosy"
8052,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"cheeks of her youngest daughter, while the others looked on, smiling."
8053,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"Then truthful Elsie bethought herself. “Irma helped me,” she said"
8054,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"quickly; “she made the circle true, and planned the wire for the top;"
8055,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,it would not have been nearly so nice without her help.”
8056,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8057,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“I didn’t do the least thing, mother, except to cut a paper pattern for"
8058,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"her, and to propose that some wire be sewed around the top. She had it"
8059,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,nearly done before I said a word. It is all nonsense to say I helped.
8060,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,All I did was to give a little advice.”
8061,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8062,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"The older daughters laughed merrily, for Irma was very fond of giving"
8063,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"advice; but Mrs. Harding drew Irma to her side and kissed her lovingly,"
8064,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,while she said: “There spoke my truthful girl. She is not going to be
8065,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,commended for what she has not done.”
8066,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8067,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“Oh! but, mother, she did truly help,” was Elsie’s eager explanation."
8068,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,
8069,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,"“Of course she did,” declared Margaret; “I have seen the time when I"
8070,ELSIE’S PLAN.—II.,needed a little good advice more than any other kind of help.”

8082,IV.,"I AM glad you do not get tired of my talking so much about myself, and"
8083,IV.,"what I have seen and heard. It shows how you have been brought up, so"
8084,IV.,far; and if we old dogs live a great deal in the past you may pick up
8085,IV.,"a little wisdom from us, after all, and be none the worse for what"
8086,IV.,"we say, if you only learn to profit by our experiences and avoid our"
8087,IV.,mistakes.
8088,IV.,
8089,IV.,"You want to hear more? Well, let me see, what shall I tell you about"
8090,IV.,this time? I am reminded by the talk I overheard about the family going
8091,IV.,"to the seaside, of the summer when I was two years old. I spent it with"
8092,IV.,my old master at a place on the New Jersey coast. There did not seem
8093,IV.,"to be any one with whom I could well stay at home; besides, my young"
8094,IV.,"master’s little girl was very anxious to have me go with them, so they"
8095,IV.,"finally agreed to it, and were not sorry afterwards."
8096,IV.,
8097,IV.,"As I remember, I enjoyed the bathing as well as any of the party, or"
8098,IV.,would have done so had I not been anxious all the time about little
8099,IV.,"Lucy’s drowning. When those big waves would roll in, it seemed to me"
8100,IV.,they meant to carry my little friend out of my sight forever.
8101,IV.,
8102,IV.,The summer proved to be one which we could all remember without trying.
8103,IV.,"For the first few weeks there was nothing very unusual happened, and"
8104,IV.,some seemed to think it was going to be very dull and monotonous. But
8105,IV.,"it “is a long road that has no turn,” and a “turn” finally came which"
8106,IV.,was exciting enough for all of us.
8107,IV.,
8108,IV.,The old settlers near the beach said we were to have a storm which
8109,IV.,"would afford us a chance for a vacation in our bathing, and give us a"
8110,IV.,"sight of some “big seas,” for we would probably see the Atlantic in one"
8111,IV.,of his angry moods before many hours.
8112,IV.,
8113,IV.,"We felt ready for the change, and lay down at night thinking what a"
8114,IV.,good time we would have the next day looking at the great waves roll in.
8115,IV.,
8116,IV.,"I knew the wind was blowing pretty fresh, but had such a protected"
8117,IV.,place that I did not know how the storm had arisen until towards
8118,IV.,"morning I heard the sound of a big gun. It sounded again and again, and"
8119,IV.,"then there was a noise in the house, and a general turn out and rush"
8120,IV.,"for the beach. Of course I followed the crowd, and soon learned what"
8121,IV.,"was the matter. There was a ship in distress, and being driven upon the"
8122,IV.,shore.
8123,IV.,
8124,IV.,"The men were there with the life-saving apparatus, and soon a line was"
8125,IV.,"got out to the ship, and they were running a kind of boat back and"
8126,IV.,"forth upon it, bringing the passengers from the ship to the shore."
8127,IV.,
8128,IV.,"Well, the people were all safety landed, but there was a splendid big"
8129,IV.,"dog on that ship, and no one had seemed to think of or to care for him."
8130,IV.,"O, yes! he knew how to swim, but that was a terribly angry water, and"
8131,IV.,"the distance was great, and they said there was an ugly undertow. That"
8132,IV.,means that water which has come pouring in upon the shore runs back on
8133,IV.,the bottom with such power sometimes as to carry anything with it that
8134,IV.,it can get hold of.
8135,IV.,
8136,IV.,Poor Hercules—that was the dog’s name—had seen himself left there
8137,IV.,"alone, the while the great waves were breaking all over the ship. If"
8138,IV.,"the poor fellow had been a fool he might have suffered less, for he"
8139,IV.,would have thrown himself into the water at once; but as it was he
8140,IV.,"knew the danger. Why, we could hear his howl above the noise of the"
8141,IV.,breakers! and some of the men were almost wild with anxiety to try to
8142,IV.,save him. I suppose none of them thought the poor dog would know enough
8143,IV.,to get into that little car which had brought the people to the shore;
8144,IV.,and if he had he could not have shut himself in. So there he was. His
8145,IV.,"owner, having several children besides his wife and the nurse to look"
8146,IV.,"after, had entirely forgotten the dog."
8147,IV.,
8148,IV.,Hercules ran up and down the deck until there finally came a wave much
8149,IV.,"bigger than any which had preceded it, and he was washed overboard. Of"
8150,IV.,"course he did then the best he could, and that was saying a great deal,"
8151,IV.,"for he was a powerful fellow; but those were terrible waves, and what"
8152,IV.,could anything but a fish do in such a sea? We could see him now and
8153,IV.,"then upon the crest of a wave, and then he would disappear. Every time"
8154,IV.,"we saw him he seemed to be nearer the shore, and we had a little hope"
8155,IV.,that some big sea would throw him near enough for us to help him.
8156,IV.,
8157,IV.,[Illustration: HERCULES.]
8158,IV.,
8159,IV.,"But the women and children must be cared for, so the people were soon"
8160,IV.,"gone, only a few of the boarders remaining to watch the sea, all"
8161,IV.,believing the four-footed passenger to have been drowned. Looking
8162,IV.,"steadily, I thought I caught sight of the fellow once, then again, and"
8163,IV.,"much nearer the shore. Yes, there he was, and a big wave landed him so"
8164,IV.,"near that his body actually rolled over on the sand, as the waves ran"
8165,IV.,back to their home again. He was too weak to help himself; but I ran
8166,IV.,"down, and before the next wave came seized him by the back of the neck"
8167,IV.,and stopped his rolling; but he was too heavy for me to drag alone. My
8168,IV.,"presence, however, seemed to give him courage, and he got upon his feet"
8169,IV.,again; then came another wave and covered us both. This did not prove
8170,IV.,"to be so heavy as most of them, and the men came to our assistance, so"
8171,IV.,brave Hercules was saved.
8172,IV.,
8173,IV.,Those who had remained to see this part of the scene sent up a rousing
8174,IV.,"shout, and both of us were petted at a great rate."
8175,IV.,
8176,IV.,I have never seen many happier moments in my long life than those which
8177,IV.,"followed for a little while. I was so glad to see this stranger safe,"
8178,IV.,and glad that I had been able to help save him!
8179,IV.,
8180,IV.,"He understood it all, too, though he did not understand English very"
8181,IV.,well. I need not tell you that we were together that summer all we
8182,IV.,"could be. The man who owned the dog had gone off and left him, and my"
8183,IV.,"master said that Hercules belonged to him more than to any one else,"
8184,IV.,because I had been the means of saving his life.
8185,IV.,
8186,IV.,But after a while the dog’s master came down there from New York to
8187,IV.,"look after the wreck, and see if he could not find anything of value"
8188,IV.,washed ashore which belonged to him. The place proved so pleasant
8189,IV.,that he sent for his family to come and spend a few weeks. They had
8190,IV.,experienced such a fright from the ocean the day of the wreck that at
8191,IV.,"first they were very shy of the water, but it was not long before they"
8192,IV.,"were in with the others, enjoying the bathing."
8193,IV.,
8194,IV.,"This lasted for some time, and the children became very careless,"
8195,IV.,venturing out where they ought not. My new friend and his master had
8196,IV.,"not met since the day of the storm, as they were bathing at another"
8197,IV.,part of the beach. For some reason my master decided not to go into
8198,IV.,"the water one day, and we took a stroll along the beach to where those"
8199,IV.,"people were bathing. We had hardly reached the place, and my master"
8200,IV.,"seated himself in a comfortable position to watch the bathers, when"
8201,IV.,"Hercules gave a loud bark, as much as to say “Come,” and bounded into"
8202,IV.,"the breakers. Of course I followed fast after him, on, on, out into"
8203,IV.,the sea; and he had his master’s little Gretchen by the back of her
8204,IV.,bathing-suit and was starting for the shore. It was a hard struggle; it
8205,IV.,was all both of us could do to save her.
8206,IV.,
8207,IV.,"The poor child was almost gone when we got to her, for no one had"
8208,IV.,noticed her trouble and danger except Hercules.
8209,IV.,
8210,IV.,"Well, there was a scene on the shore again, and for a time one could"
8211,IV.,"hardly tell which the father was most rejoiced over, the saving of his"
8212,IV.,"child, or the sight of the dog who had saved her life."
8213,IV.,
8214,IV.,"Yes, we had a good time the rest of the summer, and then we had to"
8215,IV.,part; for of course the man had his dog back again.
8216,IV.,
8217,IV.,How I have wished I might see the brave fellow once more. I think he
8218,IV.,will never be forsaken again.
8219,IV.,
8220,IV.,They went away from the coast a little earlier than we did. The
8221,IV.,"children all bade me good-by, and Hercules’ master invited me to go"
8222,IV.,"with them. We had a long visit the night before they went, and both"
8223,IV.,of us felt very sorry to part company; but some way people do not
8224,IV.,"think that we dogs have much heart, or ever mourn for absent friends."
8225,IV.,"There, excuse that tear, but it always makes me feel badly to talk of"
8226,IV.,"Hercules, and that delightful summer by the sea."

8252,BY THE PANSIES.,"He was just a boy, but he remembers lots of queer things. He went to"
8253,BY THE PANSIES.,"church in a kind of a barn; the front part was the church, and there"

8256,BY THE PANSIES.,a school kept in a little room on Water Street; the woman who taught
8257,BY THE PANSIES.,it had twenty scholars. The mail was brought once a week by a man on
8258,BY THE PANSIES.,"horseback, and the postmaster had a row of old boots nailed up on the"

8272,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,THE word “Chicago” used to be spelled “Chicagoux.” Some people think
8273,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,"it was named for the “Cheagomeinan River,” which is the Indian name"
8274,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,for the Chicago River. The Indians called the Mississippi River
8275,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,"“Chacaqua,” which means “divine river,” and I think they worked the"
8276,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,name Chicago out of all these notions. My uncle says the name of the
8277,ROBERT CHAPPELL.,"French fort in 1688 was Fort Checagou. I like to study about names, and"

8298,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,I READ about how Chicago came to be called the “Garden City.” It grew
8299,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,"out of hard times. They had what is called a business panic, when"
8300,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,"everybody owed everybody else, and could not pay them, and business was"
8301,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,"awfully dull, and people thought the town was going to ruin. The most"
8302,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,people had to do was to take care of their grounds. They whitewashed
8303,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,"the fences, cleaned up the yards, planted fruits and vines, and did"
8304,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,everything they could think of to make their places look pretty. I
8305,ROBERT TOWNSEND.,suppose they hoped somebody would come along and buy them. And that is

8313,ALICE PETERSON.,have had so high an opinion of the city as people do who live there
8314,ALICE PETERSON.,now. A Mr. Miltimore built a schoolhouse on Madison Street which was
8315,ALICE PETERSON.,"called “Miltimore’s Folly,” because people did not believe that there"
8316,ALICE PETERSON.,would ever be children enough in the town to fill so large a building.
8317,ALICE PETERSON.,The mayor of the city urged the Council to have it turned into an
8318,ALICE PETERSON.,"insane asylum, or sold, and the money from it used to build and care"
8319,ALICE PETERSON.,"for a smaller building, suited to the present and future needs of the"
8320,ALICE PETERSON.,"city! I don’t think he could have been a very bright man, because in"
8321,ALICE PETERSON.,less than four years from that time the building was not only crowded

8510,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8511,EDMUND SPENSER.,"JUST three hundred years ago, and just one hundred years after Columbus"
8512,EDMUND SPENSER.,"discovered America and planted his flag on San Salvador, there stood in"
8513,EDMUND SPENSER.,"the middle of a wide, boggy Irish plain a building better than most of"
8514,EDMUND SPENSER.,"those anywhere near it, called Kilcolman Castle. It was a time when the"
8515,EDMUND SPENSER.,English Government was having a hard time to keep the Irish under their
8516,EDMUND SPENSER.,"control, and we shall see after a while how the poor people of the"
8517,EDMUND SPENSER.,"castle suffered on account of this fact. But there lived at Kilcolman,"
8518,EDMUND SPENSER.,"in those days from 1586 to 1598, one of the most celebrated of the"
8519,EDMUND SPENSER.,poets about whom we shall talk in our English Literature Papers. It was
8520,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Edmund Spenser, and the old picture of him that has come down to us"
8521,EDMUND SPENSER.,"shows him to be a kind, gentle looking man, with a long thin nose and"
8522,EDMUND SPENSER.,"a high forehead, dressed in a black robe, and with a great lace collar"
8523,EDMUND SPENSER.,"coming up above his ears, which must have been very uncomfortable in"
8524,EDMUND SPENSER.,warm weather.
8525,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8526,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Spenser was born in a part of London called East Smithfield, right"
8527,EDMUND SPENSER.,under the shadow of the great Tower; and it is a very disagreeable
8528,EDMUND SPENSER.,"fact to one who is trying to write about him, that we know almost"
8529,EDMUND SPENSER.,"nothing about the little events of his life, and especially of his"
8530,EDMUND SPENSER.,"boyhood. Three hundred years ago, you know, people did not take notes"
8531,EDMUND SPENSER.,"of themselves so much as we do nowadays, or as they did even in the"
8532,EDMUND SPENSER.,last century; or if they did they have not been kept for us. Just a few
8533,EDMUND SPENSER.,"people have told us anything about Edmund Spenser, and the probability"
8534,EDMUND SPENSER.,is that even his picture is not any better than many of those which we
8535,EDMUND SPENSER.,see nowadays in the newspapers.
8536,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8537,EDMUND SPENSER.,One of the few things which we find about him was that he entered
8538,EDMUND SPENSER.,"one of the colleges at Cambridge when he was seventeen, as what was"
8539,EDMUND SPENSER.,"then called a “sizar.” These sizars were the poorer students, who had"
8540,EDMUND SPENSER.,to work for their living in a much more disagreeable way than any
8541,EDMUND SPENSER.,"students do now, by waiting on the older and richer ones at their"
8542,EDMUND SPENSER.,"meals and elsewhere, and were paid by their tuition in the college and"
8543,EDMUND SPENSER.,the fragments of food which their employers left for them. I suppose
8544,EDMUND SPENSER.,if the student on whom Edmund Spenser waited could come back to earth
8545,EDMUND SPENSER.,for a little while he would be considerably surprised and perplexed to
8546,EDMUND SPENSER.,find that the only reason why the world would like to know more about
8547,EDMUND SPENSER.,him would be on account of the little sizar whom he used to have at
8548,EDMUND SPENSER.,Cambridge!
8549,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8550,EDMUND SPENSER.,"When he had left college, in which we find that he was a very good"
8551,EDMUND SPENSER.,"scholar, Spenser taught for a while in the northern part of England,"
8552,EDMUND SPENSER.,and began to write the first poetry which made him at all famous; it
8553,EDMUND SPENSER.,"was a long poem in twelve parts, about the twelve months of the year,"
8554,EDMUND SPENSER.,"and he called it at first “The Poet’s Year,” and afterward the name"
8555,EDMUND SPENSER.,"by which we know it, “The Shepherd’s Calendar.” It was a very pretty"
8556,EDMUND SPENSER.,"poem, and described the scenery and the country life of England in a"
8557,EDMUND SPENSER.,way that made all good Englishmen like the author. So Spenser fell in
8558,EDMUND SPENSER.,"with some good friends, and was introduced to Queen Elizabeth. It is a"
8559,EDMUND SPENSER.,curious thing that in those days the best writers did not depend for
8560,EDMUND SPENSER.,"their payment upon the number of books which were sold, or what their"
8561,EDMUND SPENSER.,"publishers paid them; but it was the custom of the king or queen,"
8562,EDMUND SPENSER.,"whenever an especially good writer appeared, to support him at the"
8563,EDMUND SPENSER.,"royal court or elsewhere, in return for which the writer served his"
8564,EDMUND SPENSER.,"sovereign in any way he could, especially by paying him any number"
8565,EDMUND SPENSER.,of compliments in his writings. It is as though whenever a promising
8566,EDMUND SPENSER.,"young author should appear in New York or Boston, he should find a"
8567,EDMUND SPENSER.,Congressman who would introduce him to the President at Washington; and
8568,EDMUND SPENSER.,if he found that he was likely to be a pleasing writer and a convenient
8569,EDMUND SPENSER.,"friend to have near him, he should invite him to stay in the city, and"
8570,EDMUND SPENSER.,should see that he had all the money he needed.

8572,EDMUND SPENSER.,[Illustration: THE AUTHOR OF THE FAERY QUEENE.]
8573,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8574,EDMUND SPENSER.,But we shall be sorry to find that although Queen Elizabeth received
8575,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Spenser very pleasantly, and although he paid her any number of pretty"
8576,EDMUND SPENSER.,"compliments in his after life, she never did very much for him. The"
8577,EDMUND SPENSER.,first piece of good fortune which seemed to come to him was when he was
8578,EDMUND SPENSER.,"appointed secretary to Lord Grey de Wilton, who was the Governor of"
8579,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Ireland. After that he was also given Kilcolman Castle, which we spoke"
8580,EDMUND SPENSER.,"of at the beginning, where he spent so many years. We shall see that"
8581,EDMUND SPENSER.,"he did a good deal of writing while there, and also acted as the agent"
8582,EDMUND SPENSER.,"of the English Government, in looking after whatever matters needed"
8583,EDMUND SPENSER.,his attention. It was this that probably made the Irishmen dislike
8584,EDMUND SPENSER.,"him, rather than any one thing which he did, for when he had been"
8585,EDMUND SPENSER.,"there twelve years there was a rebellion among them, and they burned"
8586,EDMUND SPENSER.,the castle and forced the poet to run away to England. The saddest
8587,EDMUND SPENSER.,"thing about it was that his baby was burned at the same time, and they"
8588,EDMUND SPENSER.,tell us that the lonely father never recovered from his sorrow over
8589,EDMUND SPENSER.,"this event. At any rate he died the next year in London, in a small"
8590,EDMUND SPENSER.,"lodging-house, and probably with very little money left. It was with"
8591,EDMUND SPENSER.,"him as with so many, many others, both in those days and now: the"
8592,EDMUND SPENSER.,"people did not begin to think enough of him until he was dead, and then"
8593,EDMUND SPENSER.,"they gave him a magnificent funeral, and buried him in Westminster"
8594,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Abbey, where the graves of all the greatest Englishmen are."
8595,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8596,EDMUND SPENSER.,We know nothing but what is good about Edmund Spenser; he seems to have
8597,EDMUND SPENSER.,"been a kind man, loving everything true and beautiful, and when we"
8598,EDMUND SPENSER.,have a chance to read his writings we shall feel certain that this is
8599,EDMUND SPENSER.,so. Besides the “Shepherd’s Calendar” he wrote a book in prose about
8600,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Ireland while he was there, and it was also at Kilcolman Castle that"
8601,EDMUND SPENSER.,"his great poem, “The Faery Queene,” or as we should say “The Fairy"
8602,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Queen,” was written. This is a long, long poem, and was planned to"
8603,EDMUND SPENSER.,"be written in twelve parts, but it is probable that only six of them"
8604,EDMUND SPENSER.,were ever finished. At any rate that is all which has come down to us;
8605,EDMUND SPENSER.,and some one has said that in this work “the half is better than the
8606,EDMUND SPENSER.,"whole,” meaning that although Spenser wrote six very nice books, he"
8607,EDMUND SPENSER.,could scarcely have written six more anywhere nearly so good.
8608,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8609,EDMUND SPENSER.,The “Fairy Queen” is what people call an allegory; those of us who have
8610,EDMUND SPENSER.,read “The Pilgrim’s Progress” have probably found out what is meant by
8611,EDMUND SPENSER.,"that. In allegories the story seems to be about real people, but all"
8612,EDMUND SPENSER.,"the time the people stand for good or bad qualities, or something of"
8613,EDMUND SPENSER.,"that sort—like Christian and Mr. Greatheart, or the Fairy Queen and the"
8614,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Red Cross Knight. If we look in Webster’s Dictionary under “allegory,”"
8615,EDMUND SPENSER.,we shall find that the “Pilgrim’s Progress” and “The Faery Queene” are
8616,EDMUND SPENSER.,spoken of as the most celebrated examples.
8617,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8618,EDMUND SPENSER.,I am sorry to say that we shall find the “Faery Queene” rather hard
8619,EDMUND SPENSER.,"reading; not because the story is not interesting, but because there"
8620,EDMUND SPENSER.,were so many good English words in those days that we have forgotten
8621,EDMUND SPENSER.,"all about now. Then the spelling, as we have already guessed from the"
8622,EDMUND SPENSER.,"name of the poem, seems more like one of our PANSY “Queer Stories” than"
8623,EDMUND SPENSER.,"anything else. We will try to read just one very pretty verse, at the"
8624,EDMUND SPENSER.,"beginning of the second Canto, which describes the sunrise. Spenser put"
8625,EDMUND SPENSER.,quaint little rhymed headings at the top of his cantos; the one here is—
8626,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8627,EDMUND SPENSER.,“The guilefull great Enchaunter parts
8628,EDMUND SPENSER.,The Redcrosse Knight from Truth:
8629,EDMUND SPENSER.,"Into whose stead faire Falshood steps,"
8630,EDMUND SPENSER.,And workes him woefull ruth.”
8631,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8632,EDMUND SPENSER.,In reading the description of the sunrise we shall want to remember
8633,EDMUND SPENSER.,that there was an old story that the sun was a golden wagon driven
8634,EDMUND SPENSER.,"up the sky by the god Phœbus, and also that “chanticleer,” or"
8635,EDMUND SPENSER.,"“chaunticlere,” was the old-fashioned word for rooster. Here is the"
8636,EDMUND SPENSER.,"verse, and we will bid Spenser good-by with it:"
8637,EDMUND SPENSER.,
8638,EDMUND SPENSER.,“By this the northerne wagoner had set
8639,EDMUND SPENSER.,His sevenfold teme behind the stedfast starre
8640,EDMUND SPENSER.,"That was in ocean waves yet never wet,"
8641,EDMUND SPENSER.,"But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre"

8960,THE FIRST FLAG.,"there are only twelve, when everybody knows that thirteen was the"
8961,THE FIRST FLAG.,original number? The explanation is said to be that at the time this
8962,THE FIRST FLAG.,particular flag was made—that is in 1779—the Legislature of Maryland
8963,THE FIRST FLAG.,"had not yet formally joined the Union, so her star was omitted."
8964,THE FIRST FLAG.,

8967,THE FIRST FLAG.,"and beautiful. Then it went to war, and was shot and fell into the"
8968,THE FIRST FLAG.,"sea. A young lieutenant, Stafford by name, jumped overboard to save"
8969,THE FIRST FLAG.,the flag. When it fell the British thought the Yankees had “struck
8970,THE FIRST FLAG.,"their colors,” but in a little time it waved aloft again, trimmed with"
8971,THE FIRST FLAG.,bullet holes. You must read in our United States history about the
8972,THE FIRST FLAG.,"great victory which Captain Jones and his brave vessel, the _Bonhomme"

8999,PANSY.,and sharpened on both sides. In a bunch of arrows these points are
9000,PANSY.,absolutely uniform. The shaft is made of ash about twenty-three inches
9001,PANSY.,long. The feathers are glued on and lashed at each end with sinew. The
9002,PANSY.,"head or point is inserted in the wood, and also lashed with sinew."
9003,PANSY.,And running along the arrow are three wave-like grooves from the head
9004,PANSY.,"to the feathers. This, the Indians explain, is to make the arrow go"
9005,PANSY.,"straight. The bow is also made of ash, and with a string of twisted"
9006,PANSY.,sinew taken from along the back of a beef. So that with an ordinary
9007,PANSY.,"butcher knife and a file, if it is to be had, an Indian can make his"

9241,V.,
9242,V.,I want my young friends to remember that the way is always open for
9243,V.,"any dog to get a good name if he will only try. Why, even a little"
9244,V.,"insignificant poodle can be of use. There is our neighbor, Mr. Fellows;"
9245,V.,"he had two or three dog sentinels all about his place, and the other"
9246,V.,"night a man got clear to his front door, and none of these big fellows"
9247,V.,said or knew any thing of it; but the moment the man reached the door
9248,V.,"little Tip, the poodle, notified the whole house."
9249,V.,
9250,V.,"Well, this dog Sport was taken by his master, one fall, away off into"
9251,V.,the wood. They went miles and miles beyond where anybody pretended
9252,V.,"to live, and there in a little hut they staid for days and days, the"
9253,V.,master hunting and fishing and resting.
9254,V.,
9255,V.,"This was all well enough so long as nothing unusual occurred, though"
9256,V.,it was pretty lonesome for the four-footed one. The master seemed to
9257,V.,"take it for granted that his dog knew nothing but how to follow game,"
9258,V.,"so said little to him, sometimes hardly noticing him from morning till"
9259,V.,night.
9260,V.,
9261,V.,"As I said, matters moved on very well for a time, but there came a"
9262,V.,"change. Mr. Stillman awoke one night feeling very ill, and by morning"
9263,V.,was sick enough.
9264,V.,
9265,V.,"He took such medicine as he had, but grew worse and worse. The poor man"
9266,V.,"could not sit up to write, and if he could have written, who would be"
9267,V.,mail carrier for him?
9268,V.,
9269,V.,"He lay there and thought, and tried to plan. “If I only had a St."
9270,V.,Bernard dog I might send him for help; but Sport is nothing but a
9271,V.,"hunting dog, and he cannot understand anything but how to follow a"
9272,V.,track.”
9273,V.,
9274,V.,"In the meantime Sport was feeling badly, and trying to think what he"
9275,V.,"might do, for his master was getting worse all the time. Walking around"
9276,V.,"the room he saw an envelope with something in it, and while his master"
9277,V.,"was seemingly asleep, he took the package in his mouth and started upon"
9278,V.,the run in the direction in which they came into the woods.
9279,V.,
9280,V.,He made pretty fast time for eight or ten miles; then he came to a
9281,V.,"trail, and knew a party had passed there not long before. So, putting"
9282,V.,"his nose to the ground, he soon learned which way they had gone, and"
9283,V.,followed them at good speed.
9284,V.,
9285,V.,Fortunately he came upon them where they had encamped for the night. It
9286,V.,proved to be quite a large party with an experienced guide.
9287,V.,
9288,V.,"Sport dashed in among them and laid down his package and barked, to"
9289,V.,"call their attention to it. The men examined the writing, and while it"
9290,V.,did not tell them how it was sent—it not having been sent—it seemed to
9291,V.,"be an attempt of some one to leave on record the condition he was in,"
9292,V.,"his name and address, so that if he should die, any one finding this"
9293,V.,might be able to inform his friends.
9294,V.,
9295,V.,No one of those who first composed the party knew what to think of the
9296,V.,"paper, for there was little of it which could be read, more than the"
9297,V.,"name; but the guide was not long in interpreting Sport’s meaning, and"
9298,V.,told them that the faithful dog had without doubt come from some one in
9299,V.,"distress, and that they must try to find him."
9300,V.,
9301,V.,“If I don’t miss my guess by a shot or two this four-legged
9302,V.,mail-carrier will be dreadful glad to pilot us back the way he came;
9303,V.,"won’t you, old fellow?”"
9304,V.,
9305,V.,Sport showed his readiness by jumping up and starting; but
9306,V.,"Simpkins—that was the guide’s name—called him back, patted him on the"
9307,V.,"head, and gave him something to eat, promising to go with him pretty"
9308,V.,soon.
9309,V.,
9310,V.,[Illustration: SPORT BEFRIENDS HIS MASTER.]
9311,V.,
9312,V.,"The guide told the party to remain there, all but one or two, till"
9313,V.,"he should return. One of their number was a doctor, who was taking"
9314,V.,"his vacation, and he volunteered to be one of the company to make the"
9315,V.,search for the supposed sufferer. Although all had believed themselves
9316,V.,"to be tired, yet they were soon off, Sport taking the lead, and so"
9317,V.,eager that he let his followers only just keep in sight. It was dark
9318,V.,some time before the little hut was reached.
9319,V.,
9320,V.,"When the men told the story afterward, they said it was a great wonder"
9321,V.,"they kept on following a dog in that way, though the guide never"
9322,V.,hesitated; and the men probably preferred following him to being left
9323,V.,alone.
9324,V.,
9325,V.,"As they neared the place on the main trail, Sport would run ahead and"
9326,V.,"bark, and then come back to the guide and whine."
9327,V.,
9328,V.,"Well, they got to the hut at last, and it appeared as though the sick"
9329,V.,"man had not moved while his faithful friend was gone; and what is more,"
9330,V.,the doctor said he never would have moved if help had not come.
9331,V.,
9332,V.,"The men rubbed him and gave him medicine, and towards morning he opened"
9333,V.,"his eyes. It took him a little while to make out what it all meant, but"
9334,V.,"when Sport heard his voice he sprang to his side, and seemed wild with"
9335,V.,delight.
9336,V.,
9337,V.,There is a great deal more to this story which I will not take time to
9338,V.,"tell. The doctor tried hard to buy Sport after that, but his master"
9339,V.,said he would sooner let him have one of his hands; he kept him until
9340,V.,he died of old age.
9341,V.,
9342,V.,Before he died Mr. Stillman had his picture painted by a fine artist.
9343,V.,"Master and dog have been dead for years, but I have seen both their"
9344,V.,"pictures, made by the same man. Saw them often when I was little. Our"
9345,V.,"folks used to tell the story to people who visited them, and then"
9346,V.,"point to me and say: “This little fellow is related to that noble dog,"
9347,V.,and we hope he will be like him.” Then I would be so proud of the
9348,V.,"relationship, and resolve to be just as good if I could not be as smart."
9349,V.,
9350,V.,Now it is time to look around and see that everything is all right. If
9351,V.,"they have not forgotten to shut the hen-house door, we can take our"
9352,V.,places as usual till morning.
9353,V.,
9354,V.,"No, I never had such a chance as old Uncle Sport had for making a name,"
9355,V.,"but I have done what I could, and my master is not slow to show that he"
9356,V.,loves me.

9364,JACK’S DECISION.,
9365,JACK’S DECISION.,
9366,JACK’S DECISION.,"JACK was in a very doleful frame of mind. It was Sabbath morning, and"
9367,JACK’S DECISION.,as bright a day as even July could furnish to that part of the world.
9368,JACK’S DECISION.,"The birds in the trees, the leaves as they rustled, and the sweet"
9369,JACK’S DECISION.,"odors in the air, all seemed to whisper that it was a perfect Sunday."
9370,JACK’S DECISION.,"Jack wanted to go to church. Not that he was devoted to church-going,"
9371,JACK’S DECISION.,"either. The sermon often seemed long to him, and he sometimes grew very"
9372,JACK’S DECISION.,tired of counting the bits of stained glass of which the large round
9373,JACK’S DECISION.,"window was made; but on this particular morning, as he sat curled up"
9374,JACK’S DECISION.,"in the large armchair with a great pillow at his back, he made himself"
9375,JACK’S DECISION.,believe that there was nothing in life he wanted so much as to go to
9376,JACK’S DECISION.,church that day. It was not simply that the new carriage was to be used
9377,JACK’S DECISION.,"for the first time, and that Prince and Tony were harnessed together"
9378,JACK’S DECISION.,"before it, and would look splendid, but in addition to these excellent"
9379,JACK’S DECISION.,"reasons Jack had not been out of the house for nearly a week, and had"
9380,JACK’S DECISION.,"not had a ride since last Sabbath, and it seemed to him he should fly"
9381,JACK’S DECISION.,"if he had to stay in much longer. But then, Jack had the mumps, so it"
9382,JACK’S DECISION.,couldn’t be helped.
9383,JACK’S DECISION.,
9384,JACK’S DECISION.,Uncle Jack was to stay with him; or rather he was to stay with Uncle
9385,JACK’S DECISION.,"Jack, which was pleasant, for although this favorite uncle always staid"
9386,JACK’S DECISION.,"at home on Sundays, and could not take a single step without somebody"
9387,JACK’S DECISION.,"on either side to help, yet his nephew considered him the “jolliest"
9388,JACK’S DECISION.,kind of a companion.” This may have been partly owing to the fact
9389,JACK’S DECISION.,that Jack the uncle was quite young to have that title—only a boy of
9390,JACK’S DECISION.,"twenty—and he was as sunshiny, in fact more so than many boys of ten"
9391,JACK’S DECISION.,contrive to be.
9392,JACK’S DECISION.,
9393,JACK’S DECISION.,On this particular day he exerted himself to his utmost to entertain
9394,JACK’S DECISION.,"his namesake, and succeeded so well that when the clock struck twelve"
9395,JACK’S DECISION.,"the boy said, in round-eyed wonder: “Why, who would have thought it was"
9396,JACK’S DECISION.,"so late? They will be home in a little while, won’t they?”"
9397,JACK’S DECISION.,
9398,JACK’S DECISION.,"“That’s a fact,” said Uncle Jack. “I think there will be just time for"
9399,JACK’S DECISION.,"us to have our Bible story together, and a little talk about it before"
9400,JACK’S DECISION.,"they come. You know that was to finish the morning’s programme, Jack.”"
9401,JACK’S DECISION.,
9402,JACK’S DECISION.,"“All right,” said Jack, settling back on his pillow, “go ahead; I like"
9403,JACK’S DECISION.,"to hear you read the Bible better than anybody else, except mother, of"
9404,JACK’S DECISION.,course.”
9405,JACK’S DECISION.,
9406,JACK’S DECISION.,"This was no wonder, for Uncle Jack had a way of reading between the"
9407,JACK’S DECISION.,"lines, something after this fashion: “‘And a certain man, lame from his"
9408,JACK’S DECISION.,"mother’s womb, was carried.’ Just think of that, my boy! Forty years"
9409,JACK’S DECISION.,"old, and never had walked a step! That is worse than being lame for two"
9410,JACK’S DECISION.,"years, isn’t it?”"
9411,JACK’S DECISION.,
9412,JACK’S DECISION.,“How do you know he was forty years old? It doesn’t say so.”
9413,JACK’S DECISION.,
9414,JACK’S DECISION.,"“It does in another place; I hunted it up once, to see how long he had"
9415,JACK’S DECISION.,been a burden on his friends. And just listen to this as the best they
9416,JACK’S DECISION.,"could do for him: ‘Whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple,"
9417,JACK’S DECISION.,"which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the"
9418,JACK’S DECISION.,temple.’”
9419,JACK’S DECISION.,
9420,JACK’S DECISION.,"“They were a mean lot,” said Jack; “they might have kept him at home"
9421,JACK’S DECISION.,and taken care of him.”
9422,JACK’S DECISION.,
9423,JACK’S DECISION.,"“Ah, my boy! that is much the way it is to-day in countries where Jesus"
9424,JACK’S DECISION.,"Christ does not reign; still, we must not be too hard on these friends"
9425,JACK’S DECISION.,"of his; they may have been miserably poor, and to carry the man to"
9426,JACK’S DECISION.,the gate and leave him there may have been the utmost that was in their
9427,JACK’S DECISION.,power to give.”
9428,JACK’S DECISION.,
9429,JACK’S DECISION.,[Illustration: DOLEFUL JACK.—(_See “Jack’s Decision.”_)]
9430,JACK’S DECISION.,
9431,JACK’S DECISION.,“Then they ought to have taken him to the hospital.”
9432,JACK’S DECISION.,
9433,JACK’S DECISION.,"“There was none, Jackie. No provision whatever was made in that country"
9434,JACK’S DECISION.,"for the suffering poor; such things belong to Christianity. Well, ‘Who,"
9435,JACK’S DECISION.,"seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked an alms.’ He"
9436,JACK’S DECISION.,"liked the appearance of those ministers, I fancy. I suppose he said,"
9437,JACK’S DECISION.,"‘They look kind, and I shouldn’t wonder if they would give me quite a"
9438,JACK’S DECISION.,lift.’”
9439,JACK’S DECISION.,
9440,JACK’S DECISION.,"“I should say they did,” chuckled Jack, who knew the outcome of the"
9441,JACK’S DECISION.,story. Reading in this way you can see how long it might take them to
9442,JACK’S DECISION.,get through with even a short story; but Jack thought it a “tip-top”
9443,JACK’S DECISION.,way to read.
9444,JACK’S DECISION.,
9445,JACK’S DECISION.,He sat lost in thought for some minutes after the lame man had gone
9446,JACK’S DECISION.,"leaping into the temple, then said, half-doubtfully, as though not sure"
9447,JACK’S DECISION.,"whether it were just the proper thing to say: “Uncle Jack, wouldn’t it"
9448,JACK’S DECISION.,"be a splendid thing if Peter were alive now, and should come home from"
9449,JACK’S DECISION.,"church with the folks, and cure you so you could run all around?”"
9450,JACK’S DECISION.,
9451,JACK’S DECISION.,"Uncle Jack turned bright smiling eyes on his nephew. “You forget,” he"
9452,JACK’S DECISION.,said briskly; “it wasn’t Peter who did it; he was only the instrument.
9453,JACK’S DECISION.,You might as well call the cup in which you take your beef tea the
9454,JACK’S DECISION.,"food, as to call Peter the physician in this case.”"
9455,JACK’S DECISION.,
9456,JACK’S DECISION.,"“Well, then,” said Jack, looking resolute, “I don’t understand why he"
9457,JACK’S DECISION.,"doesn’t cure folks now—Jesus, I mean. People say he is here all the"
9458,JACK’S DECISION.,"time, though we can’t see him, and that he is just the same as ever he"
9459,JACK’S DECISION.,"was; why don’t he cure you, Uncle Jack, just as he cured the man at the"
9460,JACK’S DECISION.,temple gate?”
9461,JACK’S DECISION.,
9462,JACK’S DECISION.,"“He has,” said Uncle Jack promptly; “He has performed a much greater"
9463,JACK’S DECISION.,cure for me than He did for the man at the gate.”
9464,JACK’S DECISION.,
9465,JACK’S DECISION.,And then Jack looked astounded. As though he did not know that his
9466,JACK’S DECISION.,"Uncle Jack had not taken a step in two years, and even the great"
9467,JACK’S DECISION.,surgeon from the city could not be sure if he ever would.
9468,JACK’S DECISION.,
9469,JACK’S DECISION.,"The gay young uncle laughed over his astonishment, then said: “I see I"
9470,JACK’S DECISION.,"shall have to tell you something, Jackie. Before I was hurt I was in a"
9471,JACK’S DECISION.,"bad way—lame not only in my feet, but in my will power, which is much"
9472,JACK’S DECISION.,"worse. I was making a headlong rush toward ruin, and when the accident"
9473,JACK’S DECISION.,"happened which laid me flat on my back, I knew before many weeks that"
9474,JACK’S DECISION.,it was Jesus Christ trying to cure me.”
9475,JACK’S DECISION.,
9476,JACK’S DECISION.,Little Jack stared. “Couldn’t He have done it without that?” he asked.
9477,JACK’S DECISION.,
9478,JACK’S DECISION.,"“No,” said his uncle confidently; “I don’t believe He could. I wouldn’t"
9479,JACK’S DECISION.,"let Him, you see. He had called me hundreds of times, and urged me to"
9480,JACK’S DECISION.,"let Him do the best things for me, but I wouldn’t. My will power, as I"
9481,JACK’S DECISION.,"told you, was lame, sick—deathly sick; I couldn’t seem to want to be"
9482,JACK’S DECISION.,"cured, nor to do any of my part of the work. There is always our part"
9483,JACK’S DECISION.,"to do in a cure, you know.” Jack nodded, and remembered the bitter"
9484,JACK’S DECISION.,"medicine which he had rebelled against swallowing. “Well, I wouldn’t do"
9485,JACK’S DECISION.,"my part; refused out and out, and kept on refusing until I was placed"
9486,JACK’S DECISION.,on my back. I suppose the Lord Jesus knew that that only would bring me
9487,JACK’S DECISION.,"to my senses, and give him a chance to cure my heart sickness, so he"
9488,JACK’S DECISION.,let it come to me. Understand?”
9489,JACK’S DECISION.,
9490,JACK’S DECISION.,Jack was not disposed to answer. He was thinking. “Why doesn’t He cure
9491,JACK’S DECISION.,"your back now?” he asked, speaking part of his thought."
9492,JACK’S DECISION.,
9493,JACK’S DECISION.,"His uncle’s voice was a trifle lower, and hinted at strong feeling"
9494,JACK’S DECISION.,"which was being controlled. “I believe he will, Jackie, just as soon as"
9495,JACK’S DECISION.,it is best for me to be cured. I think I am going to get quite well;
9496,JACK’S DECISION.,"indeed, I may say I am almost sure of it, though the surgeon is not. I"
9497,JACK’S DECISION.,"believe the Lord Jesus has decided to let me be well and strong again,"
9498,JACK’S DECISION.,"so I can be a witness for him, as the lame man was, you remember. Why,"
9499,JACK’S DECISION.,"we didn’t finish the story, did we? And there is no time now. Here"
9500,JACK’S DECISION.,"come the people from church. You look that up, Jackie, in your Bible"
9501,JACK’S DECISION.,"sometime, and see what an unanswerable argument the man was.”"
9502,JACK’S DECISION.,
9503,JACK’S DECISION.,"Jack the younger thought over the entire story later, while he was"
9504,JACK’S DECISION.,"eating his beef tea. Thought and thought, and by a way which was clear"
9505,JACK’S DECISION.,"to himself, came at last to this point: “I wonder if He let me have the"
9506,JACK’S DECISION.,mumps so as to stop me from doing different from what mother says? If
9507,JACK’S DECISION.,I hadn’t thought it wouldn’t do any harm to run into Judge Howell’s a
9508,JACK’S DECISION.,"few minutes, even after she had told me not to stop anywhere, why, I"
9509,JACK’S DECISION.,suppose I shouldn’t have had these horrid old mumps. Maybe He knows it
9510,JACK’S DECISION.,"was the only way to cure me. Well, I tell you what it is; I believe"
9511,JACK’S DECISION.,"I’ll be cured. I guess, after this, I’ll do just exactly as I’m told,"
9512,JACK’S DECISION.,"and be a ‘witness’ myself, so that folks will begin to say of me: ‘Jack"
9513,JACK’S DECISION.,"Campbell won’t do it; his folks told him not to, and you can’t move"
9514,JACK’S DECISION.,"Jack after that any more than you could a stone wall.’ I declare, that"
9515,JACK’S DECISION.,will be tip-top fun. I’ll do it!”

9530,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9531,CLAUDE’S STORY.,CLAUDE TALMAN was ten years old. He lived in a marble house. Its floors
9532,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"had costly carpets, and all the furniture was elegant. His clothes were"
9533,CLAUDE’S STORY.,fine and rich; his food came from almost all parts of the world. How
9534,CLAUDE’S STORY.,soft was his bed. Tenderly was he watched over. He seemed to have more
9535,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"than heart could wish—not his heart, however."
9536,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9537,CLAUDE’S STORY.,[Illustration: CARACTACA BEGS TO BE SENT HOME.]
9538,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9539,CLAUDE’S STORY.,One day as he looked from his elegant window he saw a poor boy passing
9540,CLAUDE’S STORY.,drawn in a little wagon by a goat; then he set up a loud cry that he
9541,CLAUDE’S STORY.,must have that very wagon and goat. It did no good for his mother to
9542,CLAUDE’S STORY.,promise him just as good an one if it could be found in the Central
9543,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"Market, where almost everything could be bought. No, he must have"
9544,CLAUDE’S STORY.,that. That boy must sell it to him or it must be taken from him. What
9545,CLAUDE’S STORY.,right had that poor boy to something that he (Claude) didn’t have?
9546,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"His mother reasoned with him, but all to no purpose; he stormed about,"
9547,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"stamping his foot, saying he would have it if he had to kill the boy to"
9548,CLAUDE’S STORY.,get it. When he got over his rage somewhat his mother said: “You remind
9549,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"me of another Claude, only his real name was Claudius.”"
9550,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9551,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"Then Master Claude quieted down and listened, for he was fond of"
9552,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"stories, and now he knew his mother had one for him. So she went on"
9553,CLAUDE’S STORY.,thus: “Two thousand years ago there lived a large family in the country
9554,CLAUDE’S STORY.,that is now called England. Their name was Briton. They were not the
9555,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"handsomest or wisest folks in the world, nor were they always gentle"
9556,CLAUDE’S STORY.,among themselves. Their houses were mere huts and their dress was the
9557,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"skins of wild animals. They were a brave people, but generally minded"
9558,CLAUDE’S STORY.,their own business. The great father of this family—I should say one of
9559,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"the big brothers—was Caractacus. He was strong and fearless, and very"
9560,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"wise and good in his way. When they were in trouble they went to him,"
9561,CLAUDE’S STORY.,and somehow he always knew just what to do. So they thought of him just
9562,CLAUDE’S STORY.,as American people think of Washington.
9563,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9564,CLAUDE’S STORY.,“Miles and miles away across the great waters lived another family in
9565,CLAUDE’S STORY.,an elegant marble palace”—

9567,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"“Now you are going to tell a story about me,” interrupted Claude."
9568,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9569,CLAUDE’S STORY.,—“in an elegant marble palace. Everything without as well as within
9570,CLAUDE’S STORY.,this beautiful mansion was costly and wonderful. There was nothing just
9571,CLAUDE’S STORY.,like it on all the face of the earth.
9572,CLAUDE’S STORY.,
9573,CLAUDE’S STORY.,“But they were unhappy. They wanted something more. One day while they
9574,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"were sitting and feasting, dressed in purple and fine linen, and bands"
9575,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"of music were playing, word came from one of their travelers about a"
9576,CLAUDE’S STORY.,"fair island far away, and about this Briton family who owned it, and"
9577,CLAUDE’S STORY.,were living there so contentedly.

9708,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9709,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9710,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,IT was Nancy and the book together which put the idea into Clara’s
9711,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"mind. They were slipping along in the shadows of the quiet river, she"
9712,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"and Wallace. It was the Fourth of July, and most of the boys and girls"
9713,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,of the region were busy with what firecrackers they could get—those of
9714,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,them who had not taken a five-mile tramp to the village to attend the
9715,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,celebration.
9716,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9717,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"But Clara was too old to care for firecrackers, and Wallace had had"
9718,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"enough of them before he came; he was only here for a few days,"
9719,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,and preferred a visit with his sister to all the Fourth of July
9720,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,celebrations that could be planned. She was reading aloud to him bits
9721,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,from a new book which he had brought her as a birthday present; for
9722,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"the Fourth of July was not only the birthday of freedom, it was also"
9723,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Clara’s birthday.
9724,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9725,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“O, Wallace!” she said, “this is a lovely book.” She had said the same"
9726,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,thing at least a dozen times that day. “Just see what queer ideas
9727,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"she had,” Clara continued, meaning the girl in the book; “she was"
9728,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,very good—better than anybody I ever knew. I should think it would be
9729,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,lovely to do half the nice things she did. One plan was to pick out a
9730,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,friend—another girl—and try to help her in every way she could. Pray
9731,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"for her, you know, and talk with her, and influence her, until at last"
9732,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,the girl would be converted; then they two would choose two others to
9733,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"help in the same way, and they were going to see how large a circle"
9734,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,they could make of that kind. She thought perhaps she could reach all
9735,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"around the world; she was only a young girl, and she thought if she"
9736,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"lived to be a woman perhaps she could. Wallace, what are you laughing"
9737,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,at?”
9738,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9739,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“At the modesty of the young woman and her ideas,” said Wallace,"
9740,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"laughing afresh. “She hasn’t gotten around the world yet, I take it;"
9741,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,I’ve never seen anything of her.”
9742,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9743,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“I am sure the idea is beautiful,” said Clara, half-inclined to be"
9744,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,vexed with Wallace for making sport of it. “And of course one could do
9745,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,a great deal of good in that way. I would just like to try it.”
9746,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9747,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Why don’t you?” Wallace asked, his eyes twinkling; “I’m sure you"
9748,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,have a good field for work of the sort here among the natives. Look
9749,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,at that specimen on the bank at this moment. Her eyes are as large as
9750,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"sunflowers, and she looks as though she might take any amount of doing"
9751,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,good to and not be hurt by it.”
9752,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9753,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Clara turned around and stared back at Nancy on the shore.
9754,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9755,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"A little girl with a sallow, wistful face, and great mournful-looking"
9756,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"eyes. She had on a worn and faded dress, an apron which was much too"
9757,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"long for her, but seemed to have been put on to cover the deficiencies"
9758,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"of the dress. She wore neither shoes nor stockings, and was hanging"
9759,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"tightly by the two strings to her pink gingham sunbonnet, and gazing at"
9760,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,the people in the boat with the most unutterable longing in her eyes
9761,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,that Clara had ever seen.
9762,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9763,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“Poor thing!” said Clara; “she envies us our row. I wonder if she never
9764,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,has a chance to take a row on the river? Only see how hungry her eyes
9765,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,look.”
9766,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9767,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“It is more probable that she envies you your hat and dress,” said"
9768,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"Wallace; “she keeps her eyes on them. She has an eye to the beautiful,"
9769,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,that is what is the matter with her. I am not sure but it is your hair
9770,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"she wants most, after all, though hers is arranged elaborately. She"
9771,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"would make an excellent beginning for your scheme, Clara.”"
9772,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9773,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“I am not sure but she would.” Wallace was teasing, but his sister was"
9774,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"grave and in earnest. “Row toward the shore, Wallace, and let me speak"
9775,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,to her; I never saw a child who had such a wistful look.
9776,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9777,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Good afternoon, little girl,” she said pleasantly, as Wallace obeyed"
9778,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"directions and the boat drew near, “are you having a pleasant Fourth of"
9779,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,July?”
9780,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9781,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“No,” said the child, without hesitation or ceremony."
9782,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9783,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“Not? I am very sorry. What has been the trouble?”
9784,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9785,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Nothing,” said the child, as promptly as before. Then, seeming to"
9786,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"consider something more necessary, added: “Nothing more than always"
9787,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,is. We don’t never have no pleasant times to our house.”
9788,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9789,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“You see,” said Wallace, in low tones, nodding significantly to his"
9790,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"sister, “she is in perishing need of being chosen.”"
9791,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9792,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“So she is. Wallace, you are simply making fun, but I am in earnest. I"
9793,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,wonder what I could do for the poor little thing? I have been here for
9794,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"two months, and haven’t done a thing for anybody. I have tried to get"
9795,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"acquainted with a few of the girls of my age, but they are shy of me;"
9796,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,this child does not seem to be shy.”
9797,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9798,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Not in the least,” said Wallace. “Very well, how shall we commence?"
9799,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Shall I invite her to sail with us this afternoon as a sort of entering
9800,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,wedge?”
9801,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9802,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Do you mean it?” Clara asked, well pleased, and she turned again to"
9803,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Nancy. “Do you ever go rowing on the river?”
9804,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9805,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“No.”
9806,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9807,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“Why not? Would not you like to?”
9808,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9809,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"“Never had no chance. We ain’t got no boat, and nobody won’t lend us"
9810,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"poor folks any; and we don’t never go nowheres, me and Billy.”"
9811,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9812,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“Poor little girl! Who is Billy? your little brother? Would you like to
9813,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,take a ride with us this afternoon? If you would you may come down to
9814,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,the landing and get in the boat.”
9815,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9816,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,The child stared for a moment as though she felt her ears were not to
9817,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"be trusted, then turned and made a dash for the landing below. Wallace"
9818,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,laughed and steered the boat in the same direction. A few moments more
9819,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"and they were off, with the barefooted Nancy seated comfortably beside"
9820,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Clara.
9821,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9822,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,It is only the very beginning of this story that I have space for. I
9823,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,am wondering if you Pansies cannot sit down thoughtfully and think it
9824,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"out for yourselves, perhaps write it out. The story is true, and it"
9825,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"happened years ago. Such a girl as Clara, who was spending a summer in"
9826,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"a backwoods region, for reasons which I need not stop here to explain,"
9827,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,and such a girl as Nancy met first in the way I have described; and in
9828,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,the course of that afternoon ride Clara heard enough about the home
9829,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"where they “never had no pleasant times,” to make her heart ache. The"
9830,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"beautiful idea in the book kept coming to her, or rather staid with her"
9831,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,and kept asking if she could not do something of the kind with this
9832,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Nancy. To be sure Nancy was not like the girl chosen in the book; she
9833,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"had been of about the same age and station as her friend. “But then,”"
9834,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"said Clara to herself, “she did not need help half so much as this one"
9835,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,does; and I think with this kind of people I might help one younger
9836,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,than myself better than one of my own age. At least I can pray for her.”
9837,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9838,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,[Illustration: ON THE QUIET RIVER.]
9839,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9840,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"Now the story for you to work out is begun, and I will give you just"
9841,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"a few more facts, and then jump to the end of it—that is so far as I"
9842,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"know it—leaving you to fill up the blank space. It was a stony, hilly,"
9843,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"desolate country side, where the people were very poor, and were cursed"
9844,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,with more rum saloons than with any other form of business; where the
9845,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"nearest church was five miles away; where there was no Sunday-school,"
9846,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"and no day-school except for three months in the winter. And Nancy,"
9847,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"being questioned, showed that she not only did not know what Fourth of"
9848,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"July meant, but she did not know what Sunday meant in the true sense of"
9849,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"the word; nor did she know about Jesus Christ, save as she had heard"
9850,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“Pap swear his name sometimes!” Did ever girl need helping more?
9851,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9852,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"Now for the end, so far as it can be said to be ended, for the people"
9853,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,are still living. Nancy is a young woman who wears the neatest of
9854,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"dresses and hats, and the nicest fitting boots and gloves. She is"
9855,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,herself a teacher in the day-school in that part of the country where
9856,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,her home has always been. The school is in session nine months of
9857,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"the year. She is a teacher in the Sunday-school, which has a room"
9858,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"of its own, opening from the pretty church where every Sabbath day"
9859,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,the people gather to hear of Jesus Christ. And Nancy’s father is the
9860,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,superintendent of the Sunday-school! And there is not a saloon left
9861,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,within two miles of the neighborhood; and the change began that Fourth
9862,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"of July afternoon, when Clara, reading from her new book, caught an"
9863,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,idea which grew.
9864,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9865,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"You will perhaps be glad to hear that Wallace, although he professed"
9866,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"to be only amused, was much more than that, and helped to form Clara’s"
9867,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“circle” so effectually that he preaches in the little church whenever
9868,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,he comes to this part of the world for a few weeks of vacation. “You
9869,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"haven’t reached around the world yet,” he said to Clara not long ago;"
9870,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,“but I am not sure but you will. Do you know that boy Billy wants to be
9871,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,a missionary and go to China?”
9872,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9873,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Billy is Nancy’s youngest brother.
9874,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,
9875,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,Now see if you can plan ways by which Clara may have helped to bring
9876,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,"about such changes. No, better than that; look about you and see what"
9877,AN IDEA THAT GREW.,you can do to make a circle of good that shall reach—as far as it can.

9901,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,Our poor missionaries do have such a time in mastering Chinese so they
9902,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,can converse with the people and preach the Gospel to them. The trouble
9903,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,"is that a word may mean one of a dozen different things, just as you"
9904,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,happen to give it this tone (sound) or that.
9905,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,
9906,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,A Mr. Meadows once wished to say “bargain money” to a Chinaman. He used
9907,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,"the proper Chinese word for it, but pronounced it as though it meant to"
9908,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,the Chinaman “Do you hear? do you hear?” And what said John Chinaman?
9909,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,"Just nothing at all, but came nearer and nearer to Mr. Meadows, turning"
9910,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,one side of his head then the other to listen.
9911,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,
9912,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,"Once Mr. Pohlman asked a Chinese family if they drank wine, but he"
9913,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,pronounced the word wine (_tsén_) so it sounded to them like their word
9914,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,for land (_t’sēn_).
9915,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,
9916,TEACHING THE CHINESE.,At another time he asked a mourning family if they had buried (_tái_)

10060,POOR TABBY.,One morning Tabby went to the barn. She had tried for days to catch a

10100,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"IT was Fourth of July morning, and Davie Carson had been up since a"
10101,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"good while before the sun, not firing crackers and torpedoes, nor"
10102,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"watching the firing of the great cannon, but doing the chores. He was"
10103,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,in tremendous haste. An entire holiday was a thing he did not have
10104,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"twice in a year. A hard-working boy was Davie, with not only his own"
10105,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"bread to earn, but with a great longing in his heart to help earn the"
10106,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,bread of two sisters and a brother younger than himself. He lived in a
10107,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,small village where there was little chance of a boy of his age earning
10108,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"much. The best that he had been able to do, so far, was to seize odd"
10109,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,jobs as they happened along; or rather as he hunted them out. Not very
10110,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"pleasant jobs, all of them. Davie liked horses, and was glad of a"
10111,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,chance to lead Dr. Bristol’s to water; but to like to clean out their
10112,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"stalls was another thing. But he knew how to do this work, and did it"
10113,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"well, and had put on his great work apron this morning for the purpose"
10114,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,of taking that job next.
10115,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10116,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"It was his last one for the morning; after that breakfast, and then"
10117,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,a four-mile brisk run to the next village to the Fourth of July
10118,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,celebration. His mother had not made the least objection to his staying
10119,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,to the celebration. On the contrary she had said heartily: “I am glad
10120,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the doctor wants an errand done there; it will give you a good excuse
10121,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"for going. Of course you may stay, and welcome; and I’ll put you up a"
10122,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"nice Fourth of July lunch; and if there is something to see, or to buy,"
10123,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"that doesn’t cost more than ten cents, you just have it, or see it,"
10124,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"whichever it is. You deserve a treat, Davie.”"
10125,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10126,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,Davie laughed gleefully. It was pleasant to hear his mother speak such
10127,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"words, but he had a very different plan. Hurried as he had been that"
10128,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"morning, he leaned on his spade and thought it all out. In the village"
10129,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"where the celebration was to be was a large book store, where he had"
10130,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"once or twice been sent on errands for Dr. Bristol, and had feasted"
10131,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"his eyes upon the rows and rows of books and magazines, and thought"
10132,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,what a thing it would be to have a chance to handle them. The day
10133,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"before, while holding the horses and waiting for the doctor, his eyes"
10134,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,had rested on an advertisement in the paper—WANTED: A BOY. Then had
10135,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"followed a brief statement of the kind of boy, and what his duties"
10136,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"would be, and the whole was signed by the proprietor of the book store."
10137,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10138,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Davie’s cheeks had glowed so while reading it, that the doctor,"
10139,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"returning just then, had looked hard at him, and asked him if he was"
10140,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,getting up a fever. The splendid plan which the boy had thought out
10141,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"leaning on his shovel was, that he would clip around to the book store"
10142,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"the moment the doctor’s errand was done, and try for that place!"
10143,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10144,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"To be sure there was hardly a possibility that he would succeed, but"
10145,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"then he might, and certainly he would never accomplish anything if he"
10146,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"did not try. But he did not mean to let any body know of his ambitions,"
10147,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,so he had only a laugh for his mother’s suggestion.
10148,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10149,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,“If I get a chance to see the procession and hear the music and a few
10150,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"such things it will be all the lark I want,” he said cheerily, “except"
10151,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the lunch; I’ll be sure to want that. You are sure you can get along
10152,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,without me for such a long time?”
10153,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10154,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“O, yes, indeed!” the mother said, smiling back on him. It was so like"
10155,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,her Davie to think of mother.
10156,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10157,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Davie made good speed over the road, though it was up hill and dusty,"
10158,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,and the day was warm. He believed himself to be in ample time to see
10159,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the parade which was to be made in honor of the day. At the corner he
10160,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,halted and glanced wistfully toward the book store; it was within half
10161,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"a block of him, and who knew but that if he should appear so early in"
10162,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the day he might get ahead of somebody?
10163,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10164,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“No, it can’t be done,” he said at last, speaking aloud and firmly."
10165,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Davie Carson, I am ashamed of you! A package of medicine in your"
10166,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"pocket that the doctor said an old lady was anxiously waiting for, and"
10167,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,you thinking about stopping on an errand of your own. Just march down
10168,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,to Coleman Street as fast as your feet can carry you!”
10169,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10170,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,And the order was meekly obeyed. Here he was detained for minutes which
10171,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,seemed like hours to him. The sound of martial music was heard in the
10172,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"near distance, and people all along the streets were dodging to the"
10173,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,doors to see if anything was to be seen; but the old lady’s daughter
10174,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,wanted to write a note to the doctor to send back by Davie. She would
10175,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"not be a minute, she said; but she was."
10176,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10177,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“I might call for the note on my way home,” Davie timidly suggested."
10178,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"But she said, “O, no! that was not worth while; she could just as well"
10179,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"write it now, and make sure of it; she would have it ready very soon.”"
10180,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"And the sound of music drew nearer and nearer, until it passed the"
10181,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,corner and faded in the distance; and the note was ready at last.
10182,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10183,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Davie crowded it into his pocket, tried to listen respectfully to"
10184,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"several messages besides, and went down the stairs three steps at a"
10185,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,time to follow that fading music. The street was nearly deserted; all
10186,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the boys had rushed out of sight with the procession. Davie took long
10187,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"strides in the same direction, and wondered if it would be improper to"
10188,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,break into a run.
10189,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10190,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,Appearing at that moment around the corner ahead of him was a belated
10191,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"group—a father, mother and two children; odd-looking people, queerly"
10192,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"dressed, and seeming to be entirely out of place in a town."
10193,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10194,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,“Halloo! what’s the matter now?” Another corner had been reached and
10195,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"turned by the people ahead of him, with the exception of the youngest"
10196,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"of the group, who had tumbled down; it was her outcry which roused"
10197,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"him. He picked her up, brushing the dust and soil from her clothes,"
10198,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"straightening the much bent sunbonnet, and urging her not to cry, that"
10199,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,they would find the others in a jiffy. She stopped crying the moment
10200,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"she discovered herself in kind hands, and looked confidingly at Davie"
10201,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"out of great blue eyes, and slipped her small brown hand into his with"
10202,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"great satisfaction. Then they two turned the corner, and were at once"
10203,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"in a crowd. The thing which astonished and troubled him was, that"
10204,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the father and mother and older sister of his little girl seemed to
10205,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,have disappeared. For a weary half-hour the two jostled against the
10206,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,crowd and stared and hunted. At last there darted toward him an angry
10207,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"father, talking broken English in loud tones, followed by an angrier"
10208,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,mother and a crying little girl. “What was he doing with Gretchen? How
10209,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"dare he steal their Gretchen and make off with her! Bad, wicked boy!"
10210,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"The police should know all about it, that they should!” In vain Davie"
10211,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,tried to explain; they were too excited and frightened to listen to
10212,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,explanations. In the midst of Davie’s attempts two well-dressed boys
10213,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"standing near, broke into laughter, and so confused him that he stopped"
10214,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"short, and the enraged family trudged away, his little girl in his"
10215,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"arms, and the father shaking his head at Davie. But the little girl"
10216,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,looked back and smiled lovingly on him.
10217,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10218,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,Then Davie found that the crowd were trying to get near the band stand.
10219,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10220,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Come this way,” said one of the boys who had laughed, touching"
10221,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,his shoulder; “there is a chance to slip in behind here and get a
10222,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"first-rate position.” Davie thanked them, and was just going to slip"
10223,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"in, when a little girl who was flying past, going in the opposite"
10224,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"direction from the pushing crowd, jostled against him, and as she did"
10225,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,so dropped from under her arm a small package. Davie picked it up
10226,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"and looked eagerly after the girl, shouting, “Hold on, you’ve lost"
10227,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,something!” But she flew like the wind.
10228,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10229,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“You can’t catch her,” said a man; “she is lost in the jam by this"
10230,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,time. You may as well pocket the bundle and call it Fourth of July

10233,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“And you will lose your chance in here if you don’t come this minute,”"
10234,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"said one of the boys, trying to keep a way open for him."
10235,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10236,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Thank you,” said Davie, “but I think I ought to find the little girl,”"
10237,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"saying which he struck into the crowd, and began his search."
10238,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10239,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"It was several hours afterwards that a boy who was very tired, and who,"
10240,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"if he had not been so disappointed, would have been hungry, came out"
10241,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,of the handsome book store and with slow steps started for his long
10242,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,walk home. He had delivered the medicine for which he came in the first
10243,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,place; he had the note for the doctor safe in his pocket; he had picked
10244,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"up a little German girl, and after much trouble given her back to a"
10245,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"father who was angry at him about it; he had followed a little girl, or"
10246,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"rather followed the road over which she vanished, for two weary hours,"
10247,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"and at last found her and restored the lost parcel, only to hear her"
10248,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,laugh gleefully and declare that there was nothing in it but some
10249,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"dried-up sandwiches, which he was welcome to if he wanted them. And not"
10250,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"a glimpse of procession, or sound of martial music or voice of public"
10251,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"speaker had he seen or heard that day, save the few strains in the"
10252,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,distance which had lured him in the morning.
10253,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10254,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Moreover, he had called at the book store only to have the proprietor"
10255,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"shake his head and say: “Of course, my boy, I couldn’t engage you for"
10256,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,such a place as this without references. For whom do you work when you
10257,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,are at home?”
10258,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10259,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,Davie explained that they had been but a short time in that part
10260,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"of the country; he had no regular place, but did odd jobs for Dr."
10261,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Bristol—cleaned out the stable and such things. No, Dr. Bristol did not"
10262,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,know much about him—nobody did but mother—and he had not known that a
10263,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,recommendation would be needed.
10264,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10265,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“I might just as well have staid at home and helped mother,” said"
10266,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Davie, as he walked slowly, with head down. “I’ve lost a day, and"
10267,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"gained nothing at all. I wish I had—no, I don’t either. I did what I"
10268,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,thought was right. I’m glad I did it.” Whereupon Davie whistled.
10269,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10270,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Who was that boy, father, and what did he want?” A young man asked the"
10271,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,question of the bookseller as he came back to his parlor; he liked the
10272,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,looks of the boy.
10273,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10274,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Do you know anything about him?” replied the father, and before he"
10275,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"could answer a bright-faced little girl chimed in: “O, Uncle Edward!"
10276,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,what is his name? Don’t you know? I’m so sorry if you don’t; papa
10277,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,wants to know it.”
10278,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10279,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“No, sir,” said the young man; “I don’t know him; but he is the chap I"
10280,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"was telling you about who wandered around with that little German girl,"
10281,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"and took patiently a hard scolding from the father afterwards, and a"
10282,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"laugh from two well-dressed, thoughtless boys.”"
10283,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10284,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“Is he, indeed?” said the father; “I wish I had known it.”"
10285,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10286,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"Then the little girl: “And O, Uncle Edward! don’t you think he is"
10287,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,the very same boy who hunted after me for two hours to give me those
10288,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,sandwiches. Papa said I was a little dunce not to ask his name; that he
10289,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,ought to be rewarded for honesty and faithfulness.”
10290,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10291,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"“I know his name,” said Uncle Edward, “and I believe I will reward him.”"
10292,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10293,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"The next morning, when Davie was out in the little garden hoeing and"
10294,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"whistling, a strange thing happened to him; he received a letter—the"
10295,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,first letter with his name on the envelope which he had ever received.
10296,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,It was short and to the point:
10297,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,
10298,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,After you left me yesterday two witnesses to your
10299,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"honesty and faithfulness, as well as to your good"
10300,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"temper under provocation, called upon me, and made me"
10301,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,decide to give you a month’s trial in the store if
10302,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,you still wish the situation. Call on me to-day if
10303,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,"possible; if not, to-morrow will do."
10304,DAVIE’S WITNESSES.,

10328,BY THE PANSIES.,"Indians. The French people named the river, and they gave it that name"
10329,BY THE PANSIES.,because they saw a great many dolphins playing in the mouth of the
10330,BY THE PANSIES.,river. After awhile the Spaniards came and took the town on the day

10363,LAURA EASTMAN.,earthworks and batteries; when you had to enter the town through the
10364,LAURA EASTMAN.,"great gate or by the drawbridge. At sunset a gun was fired, which meant"
10365,LAURA EASTMAN.,"that the bridge was raised, the gate barred, and both were guarded by"
10366,LAURA EASTMAN.,soldiers. I can imagine them pacing back and forth challenging people
10367,LAURA EASTMAN.,"who passed. “_Centinela alerta_,” they said, and “_Alerta esta_,”"
10368,LAURA EASTMAN.,answered the outsider if he knew enough. I think it must have been
10369,LAURA EASTMAN.,"great fun. I should like to understand the Spanish language, the words"
10370,LAURA EASTMAN.,have such a musical sound. But the outsider might say “_Alerta esta_”
10371,LAURA EASTMAN.,"as much as he liked, after the gates were closed he could not get into"
10372,LAURA EASTMAN.,"the town until next morning, no matter if his home was just the other"
10373,LAURA EASTMAN.,side of the gate. Once in a long time came a messenger with news for
10374,LAURA EASTMAN.,the governor so important that for him they would open the gate; but

10395,HELEN DUNNING.,"We went through the Ponce de Leon, which I think must be the finest"
10396,HELEN DUNNING.,hotel in the world. It is built of some kind of stuff that glitters in
10397,HELEN DUNNING.,"the sun, and looks in the shade as if it were blue, and the trimmings"
10398,HELEN DUNNING.,are of terra cotta. The floors of the halls are inlaid with little
10399,HELEN DUNNING.,"bits of marble, and the marble columns everywhere make you think for a"
10400,HELEN DUNNING.,minute that you are stepping into an art gallery instead of a hotel.
10401,HELEN DUNNING.,"The rotunda is just lovely! It has eight oak pillars to support it,"
10402,HELEN DUNNING.,"each beautifully carved. The rotunda is four stories high, and has"
10403,HELEN DUNNING.,corridors on each story with more columns and lovely arches. The dome
10404,HELEN DUNNING.,"has wonderful paintings and carved figures, giving in pictures the"
10405,HELEN DUNNING.,history of Spain and France. You can look straight up through an
10406,HELEN DUNNING.,opening to the great copper columns which form the lantern at the top.
10407,HELEN DUNNING.,The large parlor is perfectly splendid. It is a hundred and four feet
10408,HELEN DUNNING.,"long, and fifty-three feet wide; but there are arches and portières, so"
10409,HELEN DUNNING.,that it can be divided into five rooms whenever the people wish. It is

10453,HENRY STUART.,when the Seminole War broke out. That was because the new people who
10454,HENRY STUART.,"had come in wanted the lands which had always belonged to the Indians,"
10455,HENRY STUART.,and wanted them driven further West. For the next seven years I think
10456,HENRY STUART.,the people had reason to be sorry that they had ever seen the stars and

10553,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"Reuben hurried. He made a frantic dash for his coat, ran his fingers"
10554,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"through his hair by way of combing, concluded to go without a necktie,"
10555,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,and tore down the stairs and out of the kitchen door and across the
10556,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"lawn, to the tune of his aunt’s words: “I believe in my heart you’ll"
10557,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"lose that car, after all!”"
10558,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10559,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"No, he didn’t. He hailed it, panting and breathless, some minutes after"
10560,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"it had passed the corner, and at last was seated in it, mopping his"
10561,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"wet forehead, for the morning was warm. But he had not forgotten the"
10562,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"big book. Four miles in a street car, with not many passengers at that"
10563,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"hour, gave him a good chance to study up that puzzling portion which"
10564,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"he could not get through his mind. So he studied and puzzled, and the"
10565,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"car rumbled on, and stopped, and went on again many times, and people"
10566,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"came in and went out, and Reuben knew nothing about them. At last he"
10567,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"looked up; he believed he could make that box now, partitions and all,"
10568,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"if he were only at home. Halloo! they were in town already, and were"
10569,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,passing Porter’s. Why! then they must have passed the corner grocery
10570,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,where Aunt Mary always traded. What a nuisance! Now perhaps he could
10571,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,not get this car on its return trip. He must try for it. So he pulled
10572,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"the check, and made what speed he could back, three, four, five blocks,"
10573,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,to the corner grocery. As he left the car he wondered how they managed
10574,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"the flap that made the fastening of the inner box, and still puzzling"
10575,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"over it, presented himself at the counter of the city grocery."
10576,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10577,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"“Well, sir,” said the clerk, after waiting a minute for orders, “what"
10578,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,can I do for you?”
10579,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10580,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"What indeed? Reuben stared at him, grew red in the face, stammered,"
10581,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"mopped his face with his handkerchief, gazed up and down the rows and"
10582,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"rows of crowded shelves, gazed about him everywhere. What had he come"
10583,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,for? That was the awful question. What had Aunt Mary said? She had said
10584,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"several things, he remembered. He tried to recall the all-important"
10585,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"one. Butter? No, of course not; they made their own butter. Flour,"
10586,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"perhaps, or starch—women were always wanting flour and starch—or it"
10587,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"might have been tea. He was sure he did not know, and the longer he"
10588,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,thought the more confused he seemed to get. And there was the return
10589,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"car! Unless he took that he would have to wait a solid hour, and for"
10590,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,what? Was there any likelihood that he would remember? Reuben asked
10591,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"himself that question in a most searching manner, then sorrowfully"
10592,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,shook his head as he owned to himself that he did not believe he ever
10593,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,knew; he had not paid any attention to that part of the business.
10594,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10595,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"Aunt Mary was watching for the return car. “Reuben has come,” she"
10596,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"called out to Maria in the kitchen, as she caught a glimpse of him."
10597,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,“I must say I am relieved; I don’t know how we could have managed
10598,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"without those eggs. If I ever get hold of any hens that lay again,"
10599,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,I’ll venture to say I won’t sell all my eggs to my neighbors and have
10600,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"to depend on store ones for myself. Why, what in the world has the boy"
10601,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"done with them? He seems to be empty-handed! Hurry up, Reuben, we are"
10602,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,waiting for the eggs. Where are your things?”
10603,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10604,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"Poor red-faced, shamefaced Reuben! It was hard work, but there was"
10605,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,nothing for it but to own that the first he had heard of eggs was at
10606,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"that moment; and as for the “things,” he had no more idea than the man"
10607,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,in the moon what they were.
10608,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,
10609,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"“I believe that boy is half-witted,” the clerk at the corner grocery"
10610,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"had said, after watching him for a few minutes, and seeing him make"
10611,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"a dash for the return car, not having bought a thing. But bless your"
10612,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"heart, he wasn’t. He had wits enough. “Too many of ’em,” his Aunt Mary"
10613,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,said. The trouble with Reuben was that he had never learned to withdraw
10614,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"his thoughts from the thing which wanted to absorb them, and fix them"
10615,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,"for the time being, instead, on the thing which ought to claim his"
10616,REUBEN AS AN ERRAND BOY.,attention.

10624,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10625,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10626,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,IT was a beautiful summer day when the Westwoods arrived at their
10627,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"country home, most of them very glad indeed to see the dear old place."
10628,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"They had staid in town very late that season, Mr. Westwood’s business"
10629,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,being such that there was a time when he feared he could not get away
10630,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,at all. Now here they were turning the corner which brought the house
10631,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"into view; the great wagon following close behind, piled high with"
10632,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"baggage, and every one was glad, save Herbert. He was eleven years old,"
10633,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"and fond of his city home, and of the school which he attended, and of"
10634,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"the boys in his class, and felt very lonely and desolate. He “did not"
10635,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"know a single boy out here,” he confided to his mother, “that he ever"
10636,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"cared to see again.” “And when a fellow hasn’t any friends,” he said"
10637,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"dolefully, “it is very lonesome.”"
10638,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10639,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“Poor boy!” said Mrs. Westwood, when he was out of hearing, “I am sorry"
10640,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,for him; I wish he liked the country as I used to; the long bright
10641,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,summer days were just crowded with happiness for me; but then I had
10642,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"sister Fanny to play with, and brother Will. Perhaps it would have been"
10643,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,different if I had been all alone.”
10644,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10645,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“Children must learn to make friends of the birds, and the squirrels,"
10646,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"and all sorts of living things,” answered his father. “When I was"
10647,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"Herbert’s age, I used to know the note of every bird in the woods, and"
10648,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,I don’t believe he can tell even a robin when he sees it.”
10649,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10650,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“No,” said his mother; “he has but little chance for that sort of"
10651,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,education; and moreover he has no taste for anything of the kind; I
10652,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,wish he had.”
10653,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10654,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"The carriage which had been winding up the drive, stopped in front of"
10655,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"the old-fashioned, wide piazzaed country home. It did seem a pity that"
10656,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,anybody should feel doleful coming to such a pleasant place as that;
10657,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"but Herbert felt doleful; as he stood with his hand in his pockets, and"
10658,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"stared down the country road, he winked hard to keep back the tears,"
10659,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,when he thought of the boys in town having their military drill at this
10660,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"hour. Meanwhile his father and mother, and Peter and Hannah, bustled"
10661,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"about, opening doors and windows, and planning where the luggage should"
10662,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,be set down. Presently Herbert heard an exclamation from his mother.
10663,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,“For pity’s sake!” she said—and in the next breath—
10664,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10665,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“Herbert, come here and see what I have found!”"
10666,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10667,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"So Herbert swallowed hard, and brushed away a tear or two, and went"
10668,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"round to the side piazza from where his mother’s voice had sounded, and"
10669,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,saw a sight which made him go on tiptoe and gaze in delight.
10670,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10671,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"Pushed back, well under shelter from the summer storms, in the"
10672,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"southeast corner of the piazza, was an old, somewhat dilapidated willow"
10673,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"chair, large and very comfortable in its time, but which had long"
10674,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"since been assigned to the piazza, and not considered worth bringing"
10675,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,in out of the dews or the rain. In the fall when the family closed
10676,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"the house, the old chair had been forgotten. It had stood there all"
10677,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"winter, deserted and lonely. But in the spring it had evidently been"
10678,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"mistaken by a certain family as a house which was for rent, and they"
10679,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,had rented it and moved in and set up housekeeping on a splendid scale;
10680,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"the consequences were, that fastened ingeniously to the back of the"
10681,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"chair was a luxurious nest, most carefully woven, and within it at this"
10682,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,moment were three of the prettiest speckled eggs that Herbert had ever
10683,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,seen. In fact his knowledge of birds’ eggs was limited; he had seen but
10684,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,very few.
10685,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10686,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“O, mother!” he said softly, “how pretty it is. There is one of the"
10687,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"birds on the branches near by—a splendid fellow. Where is his mate, do"
10688,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,you suppose?”
10689,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10690,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“Not far away, you may depend,” said his mother. “What a cunning place"
10691,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,it is in which to build a house. How fortunate that the chair is so
10692,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,near that door instead of the other one. We can get along for awhile
10693,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"without opening that door at all, and they can raise their family"
10694,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"without having trouble. If I were you, Herbert, I would adopt them"
10695,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,and look after their interests and help to bring up their young ones;
10696,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,wouldn’t that be fun?”
10697,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10698,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“Well,” said Herbert, with more glee than he had shown since he had"
10699,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"left his city home, “I believe I will. I will call that fellow up there"
10700,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"on the bush Denny, and he and I will be companions this summer.”"
10701,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10702,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“That will be splendid,” said Mrs. Westwood, very much pleased, for"
10703,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"Denny was the short for “Denison,” her boy’s best friend in town. It"
10704,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"was certainly a delicate compliment to name the bird after him, and"
10705,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,showed to the mother the degree of friendship which Herbert meant to
10706,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,cultivate.
10707,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10708,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“We shall get along comfortably now,” she said to her husband"
10709,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"laughingly; “he has adopted the birds in the old chair, and named the"
10710,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"singer ‘Denny,’ so he will not lack for companionship.”"
10711,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10712,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,Ah! I wish I could tell you about the lovely summer. Never was a
10713,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"brighter, more congenial companion than Denny. He sang his sweetest"
10714,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"songs for the lonesome boy, and accepted his overtures of friendship in"
10715,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,the most genial manner possible. Before the season was over not only
10716,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,he but his wife would allow Herbert to come close enough to the old
10717,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"chair to drop special dainties into the nest for the children, and were"
10718,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"voluble in their thanks. More than that, Denny actually learned to come"
10719,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,and perch himself on Herbert’s finger and eat sugar out of his hand.
10720,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,And one of the children grew so fond of Herbert that she took many a
10721,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"walk perched on his shoulder, chirping occasionally to let him know"
10722,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"that she was there, and was happy."
10723,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10724,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“I never knew that birds could be so pleasant,” Herbert said to his"
10725,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,mother; “they are better than boys and girls in some respects; they
10726,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"never get vexed at a fellow, you know, and refuse to speak to him for"
10727,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"days together. Even Denny got mad at me once, and wouldn’t speak for a"
10728,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,whole day. Now this Denny never forgets to say ‘How do you do?’ even if
10729,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,I haven’t been out of his sight longer than five minutes.”
10730,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10731,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,On the whole the birds did a good thing for Herbert Westwood that
10732,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,summer; they turned what they thought would be a weariness into a
10733,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"season of great delight, and of daily increasing interest. More than"
10734,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"that, he did a good thing for the birds. Before the season was over he"
10735,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,had made the acquaintance of dozens of boys in the neighborhood and
10736,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"formed a society, the pledge of which was protection to the birds. No"
10737,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"stones were to be thrown, no snares to be set by these boys or any whom"
10738,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"they recognized as friends; neither were any nests to be molested, and"
10739,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,not a few of the boys became so interested in Denny and his family that
10740,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"they determined for another season to adopt a family of their own, and"
10741,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,study birds.
10742,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,
10743,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"“They are wonderful creatures,” said Herbert thoughtfully, as he was"
10744,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,reporting to his mother some of the bird stories which had been told
10745,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"in the society that afternoon, “just wonderful creatures! I don’t know"
10746,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,how I ever came to pass them by without thinking anything about them. I
10747,THE ADOPTED FAMILY.,"tell you what, mother, God must have thought about them a great deal.”"

10762,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10763,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10764,A PRETTY GIFT.,THE materials needed for this gift are a smooth thin board about two
10765,A PRETTY GIFT.,"feet long and six inches wide, some bright-colored plush, some pretty"
10766,A PRETTY GIFT.,"cretonne, a dozen or more brass hooks of varying sizes, none of them"
10767,A PRETTY GIFT.,"very large, a couple of “cock eyes” such as are used for hanging small"
10768,A PRETTY GIFT.,"picture frames, and a yard or two of ribbon, color to match the plush,"
10769,A PRETTY GIFT.,or contrast nicely with it.
10770,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10771,A PRETTY GIFT.,"The smooth board is to be covered on one side with the plush, on the"
10772,A PRETTY GIFT.,"other with the cretonne, the edges neatly sewed; then the hooks are to"
10773,A PRETTY GIFT.,"be screwed in at regular intervals on the plush side, the ribbon drawn"
10774,A PRETTY GIFT.,"through the rings or “cock eyes,” and tied in a bow ready for hanging,"
10775,A PRETTY GIFT.,and your work is done.
10776,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10777,A PRETTY GIFT.,When it comes into mamma’s possession she will select a convenient
10778,A PRETTY GIFT.,"spot on her wall, and hang it as though it were a picture. Then on"
10779,A PRETTY GIFT.,"the little hooks she will hang her glove buttoner, her small scissors"
10780,A PRETTY GIFT.,"which are forever slipping out of sight, her shoe buttoner, her watch,"
10781,A PRETTY GIFT.,"perhaps, when it is not in use, and it may be her favorite ring which"
10782,A PRETTY GIFT.,she removes when she washes her hands. I am sure I could not enumerate
10783,A PRETTY GIFT.,the little bits of useful articles which she will be only too glad to
10784,A PRETTY GIFT.,"hang on such convenient hooks, that she will find not a disfigurement"
10785,A PRETTY GIFT.,but an ornament to her room.
10786,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10787,A PRETTY GIFT.,"Now having told you just what and how, let me go carefully over the"
10788,A PRETTY GIFT.,story again and remind you of its possibilities. For I can well imagine
10789,A PRETTY GIFT.,a little girl who wants to make her mother a neat and convenient
10790,A PRETTY GIFT.,"present, but who has no plush nor ribbon, and does not even know how to"
10791,A PRETTY GIFT.,get the right kind of a board.
10792,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10793,A PRETTY GIFT.,"My dear, you are just the one I want to help. About the board; it need"
10794,A PRETTY GIFT.,not be exactly two feet long and six inches wide; it may be of the
10795,A PRETTY GIFT.,"length and width which you find convenient, and which you decide will"
10796,A PRETTY GIFT.,look well in the space where it is to hang. There are light boards used
10797,A PRETTY GIFT.,by wholesale merchants in packing certain goods which are just the
10798,A PRETTY GIFT.,"thing, and they can often be had for the asking at the store where your"
10799,A PRETTY GIFT.,mother does most of her shopping. Neither is plush a necessity. I have
10800,A PRETTY GIFT.,"a friend who made a pretty “Wall Toilet” such as I have described, out"
10801,A PRETTY GIFT.,of a bit of soft silk a friend had given her to dress her dollie. The
10802,A PRETTY GIFT.,"silk was old, but she smoothed it neatly, padded it with a sheet of"
10803,A PRETTY GIFT.,"white cotton padding, and it looked very nice; but you may not happen"
10804,A PRETTY GIFT.,"to have the silk? Never mind, don’t you remember those pieces of turkey"
10805,A PRETTY GIFT.,"red calico in your auntie’s piece bag? They are just the thing, and"
10806,A PRETTY GIFT.,"your little friend who wants to make one, and has no turkey red calico,"
10807,A PRETTY GIFT.,has some bright blue cambric which will be very pretty. All thin
10808,A PRETTY GIFT.,material will look better if the board is first padded with the cotton
10809,A PRETTY GIFT.,"I spoke of. The brass hooks are quite cheap, and so useful that I think"
10810,A PRETTY GIFT.,"we must have them; but a red cord, or a neat band of cretonne, or some"
10811,A PRETTY GIFT.,"tidy cotton twisted into a cord, finished with tassels made out of it,"
10812,A PRETTY GIFT.,"will take the place of the ribbon very nicely indeed. In short, the old"
10813,A PRETTY GIFT.,"motto, “Where there is a will there is a way,” will serve you well in"
10814,A PRETTY GIFT.,"making this gift, as indeed it will in almost any emergency in life."
10815,A PRETTY GIFT.,
10816,A PRETTY GIFT.,"I know by experience how useful the little contrivances are, and I"
10817,A PRETTY GIFT.,earnestly hope that many a mother will have her birthday enriched this
10818,A PRETTY GIFT.,"season by one of them, made by her own little daughter’s thoughtful"
10819,A PRETTY GIFT.,hand.

10847,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,lamps to light it up. You must begin to learn about it. That you may
10848,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,call moonology. One of the first things to learn in moonology is how
10849,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,"she makes so many faces; once a month a long, narrow bent face, then a"
10850,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,"little fatter, and so on till it is full as a—beer keg. Of course you"
10851,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,mustn’t think she really drinks that stuff. I guess there is no license
10852,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,in Moontown.

10854,OR MISS MOON’S FACES.,If you will study the picture with all your might and main a half-hour

10896,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,ONE day Johnny was taking a walk in the orchard with Nurse.
10897,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10898,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"He was hunting for berries, and what do you think he found?"
10899,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10900,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,He found some big white eggs hidden in the tall grass!
10901,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10902,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,Johnny wanted to put the pretty eggs in his basket and take them home
10903,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,to mamma.
10904,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10905,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,But Nurse said:
10906,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10907,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"“No, no, come away, dear. That is a nest. Hush! there comes the old"

10910,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10911,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,After that Johnny went with Nurse every day to take a peep at the gray
10912,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,goose sitting on her eggs.
10913,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10914,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"She sat and sat a good many days, and then one morning when Johnny went"
10915,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"to look, sure enough, the goslings had come!"
10916,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10917,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"They had no feathers on, and they had long, ugly necks and big feet."
10918,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10919,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"“I don’t like ’em,” said Johnny."
10920,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10921,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"The little goslings grew fast. They had a nice farmyard to live in, and"

10923,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10924,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"At night the farmer shut them up in the barn, so that the cats and dogs"
10925,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,could not eat them up.
10926,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10927,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,In a few days they were all covered with pretty feathers.

10934,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,
10935,JOHNNY’S PILLOW.,"Then they grew to be big geese, and wore a lot of feathers, and Johnny"

10947,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"“NOW you see, Emeline Frances,” said Celia, pushing herself up among"

10949,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"her arm, “it is really your fault, and no other person’s; if you hadn’t"
10950,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"been bound and determined to go out this afternoon, why, we shouldn’t"
10951,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"have gone, that’s all. It had been raining, of course it had, and"
10952,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"the walks were all damp, and you had no rubbers to wear over these"
10953,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"shoes. Besides all that, you had been told that you must not go out"
10954,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"this afternoon; but you were so vain of your new dress and hat, and so"
10955,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"anxious to show them to Lulu Parks, that you would insist on going, and"
10956,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,making me get my feet wet. Now here we are! A whole hour yet before it
10957,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"will be dark, and just a lovely time to play, and company downstairs"
10958,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"in the parlor, and just the kind of cake for tea that I like the best,"
10959,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"and we have to come upstairs and go to bed! I hope you are satisfied,"
10960,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"Emeline Frances, with your afternoon’s work. I shouldn’t have thought"
10961,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,of going out if you hadn’t have been so crazy to show your new hat. It
10962,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,is just a pity that you think so much of fine clothes. The dampness
10963,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"took the curl all out of your new feather, and it will never be so"
10964,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"pretty again; but you had your own way, and will have to take the"
10965,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,consequences. The worst of it is that you make me suffer with you. If
10966,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,this were the first time you had disobeyed perhaps I shouldn’t feel so
10967,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"badly, but as it is, I am almost discouraged. I do not see how you can"
10968,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,be so naughty and forgetful.”
10969,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,
10970,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,The lecture closed with one of Celia’s longest sighs. The door which
10971,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"led from her room to her brother Stuart’s was ajar, and he, sitting at"
10972,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"his desk supposed to be studying his Latin for the next day, listened"
10973,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,with the most unqualified amusement to the whole of it. He repeated the
10974,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"story downstairs at the tea-table, amid bursts of laughter from the"
10975,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"entire family, his mother excepted."
10976,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,
10977,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"“Mamma looks as grave as a judge over it,” Stuart said at last, when"
10978,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"the laugh had subsided. “What’s the matter, mamma? Don’t you think the"
10979,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,poor baby’s version of her troubles is funny?”

10983,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"“It has its funny side,” said Mrs. Campbell, with a grave smile upon"
10984,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"her face, “but really, it has its sad side too. You are a very good"
10985,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"mimic, my son, and gave Celia’s voice and manner to perfection, in"
10986,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,doing which you have reminded me of her besetting sin. Have you never
10987,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"noticed that the child, in her own estimation, is always led into"
10988,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"trouble through the fault of others? If she cannot blame Nora, or"
10989,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"Josie, or some of her playmates, why then poor Emeline Frances has to"
10990,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,bear it. I am really very much troubled by this habit of hers. To judge
10991,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"from Celia’s statement of the case, she is forever led astray by the"
10992,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"evil propensities of other people. If it were true, it would be sad"
10993,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"enough, to have a child so easily led in the wrong way; but sometimes"
10994,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"there is as much foundation for her theory as there is in this case,"
10995,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,when the vanity of poor Emeline Frances is supposed to have caused all
10996,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"the trouble. I have tried to reason the child out of such excuses, but"
10997,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,when she reaches the folly of actually blaming the doll for leading her
10998,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"astray, I hardly know what to think of her.”"
10999,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,
11000,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"“It is a curious development,” said Celia’s father, “but I have known"
11001,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,older and wiser people than she to indulge in it; I knew a young man
11002,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"once, who charged a moonlight night of unusual beauty with all the"

11004,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,
11005,WHO WAS TO BLAME?,"After this sentence Stuart Campbell finished his supper in silence,"

11075,LITTLE LENA.,DID the Pansies read in the papers about Lena Haupt?
11076,LITTLE LENA.,
11077,LITTLE LENA.,"She was only five years old when her mother died, and three months"
11078,LITTLE LENA.,"afterwards her father, who had kept her with him by the kind help of a"
11079,LITTLE LENA.,"neighbor, fell from a building where he had been working, and was so"
11080,LITTLE LENA.,badly injured that in a short time he died. He had his little girl with
11081,LITTLE LENA.,"him a few hours before his death, and explained to her as well as he"
11082,LITTLE LENA.,"could that he was going where her mamma had gone, but could not take"
11083,LITTLE LENA.,her with him yet. She must be a good little girl; she had an uncle and
11084,LITTLE LENA.,"aunt and little cousins in Chicago, and they would take care of her and"
11085,LITTLE LENA.,love her if she was good.
11086,LITTLE LENA.,
11087,LITTLE LENA.,Only a few days after that Lena started alone on her long journey. Her
11088,LITTLE LENA.,"uncle had telegraphed to “send her on,” and he would meet her at the"
11089,LITTLE LENA.,"Chicago depot. There was a card tied around her neck by a ribbon, and"
11090,LITTLE LENA.,"on the card was written: “Please take care of me.” There was a letter,"
11091,LITTLE LENA.,"also, fastened to the same ribbon, which told Lena’s sad little story,"
11092,LITTLE LENA.,"and asked the passengers to be kind to her, but to please not give her"
11093,LITTLE LENA.,any candy. She had a wee purse fastened to the buckle of her belt which
11094,LITTLE LENA.,had nearly two dollars in it.
11095,LITTLE LENA.,
11096,LITTLE LENA.,"As for her ticket, it had been bought and paid for, and the conductor"
11097,LITTLE LENA.,had it in charge. Before night of that long day almost every passenger
11098,LITTLE LENA.,"on the crowded train had called on Lena, and her wee purse was filled"
11099,LITTLE LENA.,to its utmost capacity with shining quarters and half-dollars. She
11100,LITTLE LENA.,herself made a great many journeys in the porter’s arms to the parlor
11101,LITTLE LENA.,"car, to visit with some ladies. And at last, as night was coming"
11102,LITTLE LENA.,"on, and Lena’s eyes were beginning to droop, and the conductor was"
11103,LITTLE LENA.,"considering how he could make her comfortable for the night, came a"
11104,LITTLE LENA.,"lady and gentleman and begged to have her transferred to their sleeper,"
11105,LITTLE LENA.,where they bought a berth for her and put her to bed.

11119,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,I WANT to call the attention of all Pansies to a statement made by
11120,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,Benjamin Franklin in his story of his life. He says he tried to form
11121,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,the habit of expressing himself always with great modesty. He was
11122,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"careful not to use the word “certainly” or “undoubtedly,” or any of"
11123,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"those words which give an air of positiveness, when the subject was one"
11124,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"which might be disputed. He tried always to say, “It appears to me,”"
11125,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"or “If I am not mistaken,” or “I should think that,” etc. He declared"
11126,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,this habit to be of great use to him in persuading others to think as
11127,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"he did, and that moreover it gave him a chance to learn a great deal"
11128,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,more than he would otherwise have had; for he said he had noticed that
11129,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,people did not care to give information to those who acted as though
11130,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,they already knew all that it was possible to learn.
11131,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,
11132,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"In many respects Benjamin Franklin was a wise man, and perhaps in no"
11133,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,small way could he have shown his knowledge of human nature better
11134,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,than by adopting such rules. But I really do not think he has many
11135,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,followers. Just watch the conversation of even quite young people for
11136,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"awhile, with this thought in mind, and see how many of them seem to be"
11137,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"absolutely sure of their position, even in regard to subjects where"
11138,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,wise men differ. If we could have more doubt about things which have
11139,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"not yet been decided, and more certainty about things which God and the"
11140,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,"Bible have decided for us, we should have a much better, as well as a"
11141,POSITIVE PEOPLE.,much pleasanter world.

11231,VI.,
11232,VI.,"WHILE the folks are gone to the fair, and we have nothing to do but"
11233,VI.,"watch around the place and see that no tramp gets in, we might as"
11234,VI.,"well have a good time, and I will tell you about my brother Nero. You"
11235,VI.,"must not forget, though, but keep eyes, ears and nose open while I am"
11236,VI.,talking.
11237,VI.,
11238,VI.,"To begin with, there was a very large family of us, or would have been"
11239,VI.,if we had all been kept together. There were brothers and sisters
11240,VI.,"older, and a good many younger than we. We were of the same age, and"
11241,VI.,"there were three others just our age, too; but they had gone to live"
11242,VI.,"with other families, and Nero and I were all there were left with"
11243,VI.,"mother. Poor, dear mother! I remember well how she used to feel when"
11244,VI.,"her children were taken away from her, though I was too young at that"
11245,VI.,time to realize it.
11246,VI.,
11247,VI.,"When we were alone she would sigh, and many a tear have I seen fall"
11248,VI.,"from her eyes, as she would lap us and think of her darlings whose"
11249,VI.,faces she knew not that she would ever see again.
11250,VI.,
11251,VI.,"She, poor mother, seemed to lavish all her love upon us after the other"
11252,VI.,three were gone.
11253,VI.,
11254,VI.,"Mr. Bryant, our master, had a daughter—only one—whose name was Fanny."
11255,VI.,Her father and mother seemed to think the world of her; and the thing
11256,VI.,"that puzzled mother was, that Mrs. Bryant, being a mother herself,"
11257,VI.,"should not feel more for her four-footed friend, who was a mother also."
11258,VI.,"She fed us enough, and never abused us in the ways in which so many"
11259,VI.,abuse their dogs; but when it came to parting mother and children it
11260,VI.,"never seemed to occur to her that a mother with four feet, and that"
11261,VI.,"couldn’t talk, could have any motherly feelings, or care what became of"
11262,VI.,her little ones.
11263,VI.,
11264,VI.,I remember little Fanny was not so. She would cry every time one of my
11265,VI.,"brothers or sisters was taken away, and after one was gone would come"
11266,VI.,out with us and put her arms around mother’s silky neck and cry as
11267,VI.,though her heart would break.
11268,VI.,
11269,VI.,"Well, one day while we were quite small a man came to the house. I"
11270,VI.,"think he was some kind of agent. He saw mother, and could not help"
11271,VI.,"admiring her glossy coat and beautiful eyes, and so was anxious to"
11272,VI.,"get one of our family. He wanted mother herself, but soon found that"
11273,VI.,"money could not buy her. Fanny overheard them talking about us, and"
11274,VI.,"then slipped quietly out of the room, and came in great haste to where"
11275,VI.,"we were, and with one of us under each arm fled to a place of safety."
11276,VI.,Down through the orchard she went till she came to an old building
11277,VI.,"which was used to store hay in; there, in a hole which she and some"
11278,VI.,"of her playmates had made to hide in, she put us, and covered us up"
11279,VI.,"with soft straw, and fixed it so that we could not possibly crawl out,"
11280,VI.,then closed the door and went off under a sweet apple-tree to hunt for
11281,VI.,apples as though nothing had happened.
11282,VI.,
11283,VI.,"Now I suppose men will think she did not act just as she should, and"
11284,VI.,perhaps she was guilty of disobedience for not telling where we were
11285,VI.,"when they were hunting for us; but we were very grateful to her, and"
11286,VI.,"whined with delight when we heard the man drive away, and learned that"
11287,VI.,he was not likely to come over that road again.
11288,VI.,
11289,VI.,"Fanny felt badly about it, and that night when she was going to bed"
11290,VI.,"told her mother what she had done, crying almost as hard as though we"
11291,VI.,had been sold.
11292,VI.,
11293,VI.,"Fanny’s mother explained to her how it was wicked to be disobedient,"
11294,VI.,and that it was disobedience to not do what she would be required to
11295,VI.,"do, if all the circumstances were known, and that doing wrong that good"
11296,VI.,might come of it was never right.
11297,VI.,
11298,VI.,Then after Fanny was asleep her mother told Mr. Bryant why they had
11299,VI.,"failed to find us, and after he heard the whole story he said: “Bless"
11300,VI.,"her dear heart; for her sake we will keep the little fellows, and Bess”"
11301,VI.,(that was mother’s name) “will look at us with less sadness in her
11302,VI.,great eyes.”
11303,VI.,
11304,VI.,So Mrs. Bryant told Fanny that they had decided to keep us both until
11305,VI.,"we were much bigger, at least, and she need not worry any more about"
11306,VI.,our being sold.
11307,VI.,
11308,VI.,When they told mother you should have seen her leap for joy; she sprang
11309,VI.,"up upon her hind feet, and put her fore paws upon Mr. Bryant’s breast,"
11310,VI.,"forgetting in her great joy that her feet were not clean; but he, good"
11311,VI.,"man, only patted her and let her lick his cheek, and called her “Good"
11312,VI.,"old Bess,” and then told her to go and look after her children and give"
11313,VI.,them their supper.
11314,VI.,
11315,VI.,"I heard her say to one of the neighbors some months after, as she was"
11316,VI.,"telling her experience with us, that that was the first time she had"
11317,VI.,lain down with any peace of mind for weeks.
11318,VI.,
11319,VI.,"Well, the bigger we grew the more Fanny loved us, and so we did her. We"
11320,VI.,"never let her go down in the orchard, or out into the woods, or to fish"
11321,VI.,"in the brook but what we went with her, and we drove everything and"
11322,VI.,"everybody away, unless she told us not to."
11323,VI.,
11324,VI.,After awhile she decided that she wanted one of us in her room nights.
11325,VI.,To that arrangement her mother at first strongly objected; but her
11326,VI.,"father plead for her, and the mother finally consented."
11327,VI.,
11328,VI.,"When the cold weather came on Fanny got a rug, and had Nero sleep on"
11329,VI.,"that rug on the foot of her bed, “to keep her feet warm,” she said."
11330,VI.,
11331,VI.,This had been going on for some time when Mr. and Mrs. Bryant went out
11332,VI.,"to visit a neighbor’s at some kind of a gathering, and left mother and"
11333,VI.,"me outside in our kennel to watch, and Nero to remain in the room with"
11334,VI.,our little friend Fanny.
11335,VI.,
11336,VI.,"The hired man and the cook, instead of remaining at home as they were"
11337,VI.,"expected to, went to spend the evening with a neighbor, thinking it"
11338,VI.,"would be all right with Fanny, as she was asleep. But it had been"
11339,VI.,"ironing day, and the clothes had been left hanging in the kitchen to"
11340,VI.,"air, and how it was no one will ever know, but in some way they took"
11341,VI.,"fire. Mother was the first to discover it, and began to bark with all"
11342,VI.,"her might to awaken Fanny and Nero. I remember that I barked too, just"
11343,VI.,as hard and loud as I could.
11344,VI.,
11345,VI.,"Soon Nero heard it, and began to feel that something must be the matter"
11346,VI.,somewhere. His first thought was that he ought to awaken his young
11347,VI.,"mistress, and he went at the job as best he knew. But she was too sound"
11348,VI.,"asleep to be awakened by barking, do the best he could; so he sprang"
11349,VI.,"upon her shoulder and began to pull at her nightdress, and finally took"
11350,VI.,"her by the ear, and pulled so hard that it almost started the blood."
11351,VI.,"Then she awakened in a great fright, for a bright light was shining so"
11352,VI.,she could see everything in her room.
11353,VI.,
11354,VI.,"Pulling on her shoes and stockings, and wrapping around her some of the"
11355,VI.,"blankets from her bed, she opened the door, which fortunately was near"
11356,VI.,the stairs.
11357,VI.,
11358,VI.,"With the help of Nero she made her way through the smoke to the street,"
11359,VI.,about the time the neighbors began to arrive. They were too late to
11360,VI.,"have been of any help to Fanny, for the flames would have overtaken"
11361,VI.,"her before they reached there, but for Nero. By the time Mr. and Mrs."
11362,VI.,Bryant reached home the house was far gone. When they saw the flames
11363,VI.,they seemed almost crazy with fright; for they remembered that they had
11364,VI.,left their only child asleep in the second story. It was some minutes
11365,VI.,before they could be made to understand that Fanny was safe.
11366,VI.,
11367,VI.,"She and Nero had been hurried to the house of a neighbor, and when they"
11368,VI.,found them Fanny had her arms around Nero’s neck.
11369,VI.,
11370,VI.,When Fanny was being tucked into bed for a second time that night she
11371,VI.,said to her mother: “Are you not glad that I kept Nero from being sold?
11372,VI.,Because if he had not been there to wake me up you wouldn’t have had
11373,VI.,any little girl now.”
11374,VI.,
11375,VI.,"From that time Nero was a great pet, and I was very proud of him,"
11376,VI.,though I could not help being a little bit vexed because nobody gave
11377,VI.,mother and me any credit for awakening him. One day I said something
11378,VI.,"about it to her, and she said: “Never mind, Major; we know ourselves"
11379,VI.,"that we did our duty, and that is the important thing.”"

11406,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,The name of the article is Screen Bag. I have no doubt you know how
11407,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"fond mamma is of bags, of all shapes and sizes, for keeping her"
11408,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"unmended stockings, or perhaps, more truthfully speaking, your and your"
11409,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"brothers’ and sisters’ unmended stockings, for balls of cord, and rolls"
11410,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"of tape, and papers of hooks and eyes, and I have not room to tell how"
11411,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"many other things. Well, this Screen Bag is just the thing. First get"
11412,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"your frames made of common pine wood, three of them, of about the right"
11413,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,height to furnish a comfortable screen for mamma if she wishes to keep
11414,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"the wind from blowing on her, or the firelight from burning her face."
11415,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"Indeed, you must decide where she will be likely to want to use the"
11416,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"screen, and plan its size accordingly. Then you want some bright cloth"
11417,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"of a pretty color; perhaps red, if that harmonizes best with the colors"
11418,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"in your mother’s room, or possibly blue or a soft rich brown; what you"
11419,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"will, so that it is strong. Cretonne is good, so is the striped cotton"
11420,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"furniture cloth which may be found at any upholsterer’s, and in nearly"
11421,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,all large city stores. You want two kinds; one for the front and one
11422,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,for the back of your screen. The back or lining side need not be made
11423,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,of such strong material. English cambric or common calico will do
11424,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,nicely. Of course the amount of material needed will depend upon the
11425,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,size of your frames; some careful measurements with a tape line will
11426,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"be necessary. Now get your “pockets” ready, as many as you have room"
11427,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"for, and of whatever size you think the most useful. The first or lower"
11428,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,row should be a little larger than the ones above. The screen I have
11429,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"in mind had two good-sized pockets below, three smaller ones above,"
11430,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"four above them, and five tiny ones at the top. These may be made of"
11431,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"the same cloth as the screen, or of different colors, according to your"
11432,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,taste and the variety of material at command. They should be hemmed
11433,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"neatly at the top and stitched firmly to the cloth; first basted, then"
11434,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"sewed in the machine, to insure strength; or, if you do not understand"
11435,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"a sewing machine, and want to do all the work yourself, you can take"
11436,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"strong thread, and make a back stitch for every third or fourth one,"
11437,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,and do the whole by hand.
11438,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,
11439,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"Now you want some brass-headed nails—round heads, you know. Finally,"
11440,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,your frames are ready for the brass hinges on which they are to swing.
11441,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"You will need four of these, and when they are screwed into their"
11442,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,places your Bag Screen will be finished. Fifty-two pockets! My word for
11443,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"it, if your mamma does not feel richer than she ever did in her life,"
11444,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"after she has her conveniences packed away in those delightful pockets,"
11445,HOW TO MAKE A SCREEN BAG.,"which besides holding them, are at work screening her from the heat, or"

11504,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"streets in New York; but almost all of them have lovely grounds, and"
11505,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"trees, and flowers, and pretty lawns. Oh! I liked it all so much. We"
11506,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"had a picnic out at the Falls of Minnehaha, the prettiest place I ever"
11507,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,saw in my life. There is a magnificent park out there of more than a
11508,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"hundred acres, and the drive all the way through the city to the park"
11509,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,is perfectly beautiful. Then of course the falls themselves are just
11510,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"too lovely! We had Mr. Dickson the elocutionist with us, and after"
11511,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"lunch he recited parts of Longfellow’s poem about “Minnehaha, Laughing"
11512,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"Water.” I had never read “Hiawatha” then, but I have since, and I know"
11513,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,several pages of it by heart. But you cannot think how lovely it was
11514,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,to have Mr. Dickson recite it right at the falls. We took a great many
11515,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"lovely drives while we were in the city. We stopped at West Hotel,"
11516,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"which is one of the finest in the United States, or for that matter in"
11517,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"the world. It can accommodate twelve hundred guests, and it seemed as"
11518,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,though there must be that number in the house while we were there. When
11519,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,we met in the great dining-room it seemed queer to think that there
11520,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,were more people there than can be found in the village where I live.
11521,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"Still I like our little village in the summer, and would not exchange"
11522,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"it for a city. I would like to describe West Hotel, but I cannot,"
11523,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"except to say that the furniture was grand, and everything was elegant."
11524,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,We rode past Senator Washburn’s house a great many times. It is out on
11525,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"Twenty-second Street and Third Avenue, and has ten acres of the most"
11526,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"charming grounds, so that it is just the same to him as living in the"
11527,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"country. The house is built of a kind of stone which is called kasota,"
11528,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,"and is very beautiful. I did not mean to make my letter so long, but"
11529,HARVEY CAMPBELL.,there is a great deal to tell.

11535,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,I HAVE an aunt who is very fond of visiting churches. When she goes to
11536,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"a new place, if it is only a village, she wants to see all the churches"
11537,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"and know about them. When she was in Minneapolis first, years ago, it"
11538,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"was a little bit of a place, and my aunt is an old lady, and does not"
11539,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"read the newspapers much, and did not realize that Minneapolis had"
11540,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,grown a great deal. She went there last spring to visit a nephew. She
11541,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"reached there in the night, and was taken in a carriage to her nephew’s"
11542,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"house, and did not realize the changes at all. The next morning at"
11543,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"breakfast, when her nephew asked her what she would like to see in the"
11544,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"city, she said she would like to visit the different churches if she"
11545,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"could, and that perhaps as the day was pleasant they could go that"
11546,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,morning.

11552,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"“Oh! to all of them,” answered my aunt; “we can take a few minutes for"

11554,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,
11555,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"“Certainly,” said her nephew; “just as well as not. There are only"
11556,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"about a hundred and sixty, I believe.”"
11557,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,
11558,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,And that was the first time my aunt knew that she was in a big city
11559,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,instead of the little town she had left thirty years or so before. But
11560,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,I don’t think her nephew was very polite to an old lady. She saw a good
11561,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"many of the churches, among them Dr. Wayland Hoyt’s, which she said she"
11562,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"liked the best of all. It is the First Baptist Church of Minneapolis,"
11563,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,and cost two hundred thousand dollars. It will seat about fifteen
11564,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,"hundred people. I thought the Pansies would like to hear about it,"
11565,ALICE WASHBURNE MILLS.,because Dr. Hoyt wrote one of our “Regret” letters for us.

11576,MINNIE ANDREWS.,in the United States which can get above that. There isn’t any danger
11577,MINNIE ANDREWS.,"that this building will ever burn up, for it is made fire proof. I"
11578,MINNIE ANDREWS.,wonder why they don’t make all buildings fire proof? Then we would not
11579,MINNIE ANDREWS.,"have to buy engines, and pay firemen, and keep great splendid horses"
11580,MINNIE ANDREWS.,doing nothing all day long but wait for fires. This City Hall which I

11649,THE OSBORNE HOME.,(_Character Studies._)
11650,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11651,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11652,THE OSBORNE HOME.,ALL day long the Osborne home had been in a state of excitement. It
11653,THE OSBORNE HOME.,had been very difficult for the family to attend to its usual duties.
11654,THE OSBORNE HOME.,The little girls had at first declared that they could not go to
11655,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"school at all; and then, being convinced that they must, it had been"
11656,THE OSBORNE HOME.,nearly impossible to get them ready in time. Even the baby had caught
11657,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"the unrest, and refused to take his long morning nap and give the"
11658,THE OSBORNE HOME.,seventeen-year-old sister Mary a chance to attend to the work. The
11659,THE OSBORNE HOME.,explanation was that mother was coming home. She had been away a whole
11660,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"month, an unheard-of thing in the history of the family before this"
11661,THE OSBORNE HOME.,season.
11662,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11663,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"The fact is, Mrs. Osborne was one of those mothers who would never"
11664,THE OSBORNE HOME.,have been persuaded to leave her home and her children had it not
11665,THE OSBORNE HOME.,become a serious duty to do so. She had been in poor health for several
11666,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"months, and grandmamma had written and coaxed and urged, and at last"
11667,THE OSBORNE HOME.,almost commanded that she should come back to the old home and the old
11668,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"physician, and see if he could not help her. One terrible thing about"
11669,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"it was, that this same physician refused to allow her to bring her baby"
11670,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"along. “I know just how it will be,” he said, shaking his gray head"
11671,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"and looking wise. “The baby is a strong, healthy little fellow, and"
11672,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"a perfect tyrant as they all are, and he will be carried, and put to"
11673,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"sleep, and fed, and petted by his mother and nobody else; he will be"
11674,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"more positive about it than usual, being among strangers, and he will"
11675,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"just keep her worn out. There is no use in talking, Mrs. Fuller, I know"
11676,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"your daughter Mary of old, and I will not consent to try to help her"
11677,THE OSBORNE HOME.,unless she will leave that fellow at home and come away from all care
11678,THE OSBORNE HOME.,for a month.”
11679,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11680,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Well, the doctor had had his way, as he nearly always did, and Mrs."
11681,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Osborne, having declared that it would be utterly impossible to go away"
11682,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"from home and leave Baby and the little girls, and only Mary to look"
11683,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"after them all, had been gotten ready and carried to the cars. And a"
11684,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"whole month had passed, and she, wonderfully improved, was coming home"
11685,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"to-day. Father had driven to the depot three miles away to meet her,"
11686,THE OSBORNE HOME.,and the house was in commotion.
11687,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11688,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Mary, the housekeeper, nurse and mother-in-charge, had had a busy day."
11689,THE OSBORNE HOME.,There were still a dozen things which she meant to have done before
11690,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"mother came, not the least among them being to get herself in order;"
11691,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"for her apron was torn, her slippers were down at the heel, her hair"
11692,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"was what her father called “frowsly,” and, in short, she did not look"
11693,THE OSBORNE HOME.,in the least as she meant to when the mother should put her arms around
11694,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"her. Then there were last things to be done all over the house, and"
11695,THE OSBORNE HOME.,the table to be set for the early tea-dinner which was to do honor to
11696,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"the traveler’s newly-found appetite. Yet, notwithstanding all this,"
11697,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Mary, feeling sure that the time must now be short, allowed herself"
11698,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"to drop down into the chair which she had been dusting, draw from her"
11699,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"pocket the mother’s last letter, whose contents she knew by heart, and"
11700,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"glancing at it, go to studying for the dozenth time the possibility"
11701,THE OSBORNE HOME.,that her mother might have meant the evening train instead of the
11702,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"afternoon, in which case she would not be there for several hours."
11703,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11704,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“Let me see; I almost believe that is the way, after all,” she said,"
11705,THE OSBORNE HOME.,biting the feather end of the old quill which she had picked up
11706,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"somewhere in her dusting, and looking vexed and disheartened. “I am"
11707,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"sure I don’t know how I am to keep the children from growing wild, if"
11708,THE OSBORNE HOME.,they have to wait three hours longer.”
11709,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11710,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Meantime, the children, in the other room, were in various stages of"
11711,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"excitement. Helen, the older of the three, in whose charge Baby Joe was"
11712,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"especially put, occupied herself in racing to the front gate every few"
11713,THE OSBORNE HOME.,minutes to see if she could not get a glimpse of her father’s horse
11714,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"and wagon climbing the hill; and Baby Joe, each time she went, either"
11715,THE OSBORNE HOME.,reached after and tumbled over something which he ought not to have
11716,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"touched, or tumbled down, in his eager haste to follow to the gate. In"
11717,THE OSBORNE HOME.,this way the room was being put into more or less disorder.
11718,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11719,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“How perfectly silly you are!” said Jessie, looking up from the book"
11720,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"she was reading, as Helen came back panting for the third time. “Just"
11721,THE OSBORNE HOME.,as though racing to the gate every few minutes would bring them any
11722,THE OSBORNE HOME.,quicker! and look at Joe; he has tipped the spools all out of mother’s
11723,THE OSBORNE HOME.,box. A nice tangle they will be in.”
11724,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11725,THE OSBORNE HOME.,“Why didn’t you keep him from them then?” asked Helen irritably; “you
11726,THE OSBORNE HOME.,are doing nothing but pore over a story book. I should think you would
11727,THE OSBORNE HOME.,go and comb your hair and change your dress. Mother will not like to
11728,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"see you in such a tangle, I can tell you.”"
11729,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11730,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“There is time enough,” said Jessie, yawning. “I can’t do anything but"
11731,THE OSBORNE HOME.,read a story book; it is impossible to settle to anything when mother
11732,THE OSBORNE HOME.,is so near home as she must be by this time. I haven’t done a thing
11733,THE OSBORNE HOME.,this afternoon; I couldn’t. I don’t see how Elsie can bend over that
11734,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"stupid History, just as if nothing unusual was going to happen.”"
11735,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11736,THE OSBORNE HOME.,This made Elsie raise her eyes; they were pretty brown ones. She was a
11737,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"little girl of about ten, in a neat blue dress, and with her hair in"
11738,THE OSBORNE HOME.,perfect order. “I thought it would be a good plan to get my history
11739,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"ready for to-morrow while I was waiting,” she said, “then I will not"
11740,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"have to study this evening, when I want to listen to mother. I should"
11741,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"think you would like to get your examples done; and anyhow, Jessie, you"
11742,THE OSBORNE HOME.,ought to comb your hair; it looks like a fright.”
11743,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11744,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“I mean to, of course,” said Jessie. “I dare say there is time enough."
11745,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Father can’t drive fast on such a warm afternoon; and besides, Mary"
11746,THE OSBORNE HOME.,said she wouldn’t be at all surprised if he should have to wait for
11747,THE OSBORNE HOME.,the evening train. Wouldn’t that be just horrid! If it were not for
11748,THE OSBORNE HOME.,the lovely story I am reading I couldn’t endure this waiting another
11749,THE OSBORNE HOME.,minute.”
11750,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11751,THE OSBORNE HOME.,“It’s easier to wait when you are at work doing what ought to be
11752,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"done,” said Elsie, with the air of a philosopher."
11753,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11754,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“Oh! you are a regular Miss Prim,” said Helen, laughing, as she stooped"
11755,THE OSBORNE HOME.,to pick little Joe out of another piece of carefully planned mischief;
11756,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“for my part, I think it is horrid to have anything that ought to be"
11757,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"done at such a time. Joe, you little nuisance, I do wish you would go"
11758,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"to sleep, and give me a chance to watch for mother. I hope I shall get"
11759,THE OSBORNE HOME.,all the things picked up and put to rights that you have upset before
11760,THE OSBORNE HOME.,mother comes; she will not be charmed with the looks of the room if I
11761,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"don’t. However, there really must be oceans of time yet.”"
11762,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11763,THE OSBORNE HOME.,“Then why did you race down to the gate every few minutes to see if
11764,THE OSBORNE HOME.,they were coming?” Jessie asked.
11765,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11766,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"“Oh! because I did not know what else to do,” said Helen; “I knew"
11767,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"better, of course. Take care, Joe! There, I declare! he has done it"
11768,THE OSBORNE HOME.,now.”
11769,THE OSBORNE HOME.,
11770,THE OSBORNE HOME.,Sure enough he had! Jerked at the table spread where Helen herself had
11771,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"set the inkstand, intending to put it away in a few minutes, and sent"
11772,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"a black stream not only over his own white dress, but on the carpet"
11773,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"as well. Mary, who still sat studying the letter, and thinking of the"
11774,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"things which she meant to accomplish before her mother came, having by"
11775,THE OSBORNE HOME.,this time decided that it was entirely probable that they must wait
11776,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"for the evening train, heard the exclamations of dismay from the other"
11777,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"room, and rose up to see what was the trouble; but at that instant an"
11778,THE OSBORNE HOME.,eager cry from Elsie: “There they come!” sounded on the ears of all.
11779,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Helen gathered up the screaming Joe under one arm, and calling to Mary"
11780,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"to look out for the ink on the carpet, ran out of one door, just as"
11781,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Jessie scurried out of another, eager to dash upstairs and brush her"
11782,THE OSBORNE HOME.,hair before her father saw her; for his last charge had been to her to
11783,THE OSBORNE HOME.,see to it that she did not appear before her mother in that plight.
11784,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"Mary, burning with shame and disappointment over the little last things"
11785,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"which she meant to have ready, waited to mop up the ink, while Elsie,"
11786,THE OSBORNE HOME.,"closing the door on the disordered room, went forward to meet the"
11787,THE OSBORNE HOME.,beloved mother.

11807,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"not dress then just as they do now, as you can well see by noticing"
11808,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,their broad collars and queer trousers. How queer our dress will look
11809,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,to our great-grandchildren.
11810,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,
11811,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,The dear _Mayflower_ was not such a grand ship as the Cunarder. It
11812,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"had to depend—not upon steam—but upon a favoring wind, and the wind"
11813,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"does not always seem to favor, so it took her weeks to cross the"
11814,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"stormy Atlantic, and the passengers (Puritans they were called) were"
11815,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,very sick; but because they had suffered so much from cruel people in
11816,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"England they did not complain, as they believed God held the waves"
11817,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"in his hand, and he was guiding the _Mayflower_ as much as he did the"
11818,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,Israelites to Palestine—“a land flowing with milk and honey.” So they
11819,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,"patiently and cheerfully waited in the _Mayflower’s_ small cabin, often"
11820,IN THE CABIN OF THE MAYFLOWER.,singing hymns and praying and encouraging each other.

11957,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11958,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,(_Character Studies._)
11959,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11960,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11961,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,IT was a bright cool morning that we were riding down Delaware Avenue
11962,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,in a street car which had very few passengers. It gave me a chance to
11963,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,study human nature. I began the study with a very handsomely dressed
11964,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,boy. Jacket and collar and necktie and hair all showed that very
11965,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"careful people had planned for him, and that they had plenty of money"
11966,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"to spend on him. They came into the car just after I was seated, the"
11967,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"boy and his mother. She was tall and pale, and in deep mourning; I"
11968,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"wondered if her husband were dead, and if this boy were the only one"
11969,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"she had to think about or care for her. If so she was to be pitied,"
11970,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,poor woman! for it soon became evident that the young man thought about
11971,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,and cared for himself. His first exhibition was to fling his heavy
11972,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"overcoat on his mother’s lap as he said: “Here, mamma, hold that, and"
11973,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,give me the tickets for the conductor.”
11974,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11975,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“I haven’t tickets, dear,” she said; “I shall have to buy some.”"
11976,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11977,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“O, well! all right, give me your pocket-book and let me buy them.”"
11978,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11979,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“No, dear, there is a good deal of money in my pocket-book, and some"
11980,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,valuable papers.”
11981,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11982,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“What of that?” he said, in a tone loud enough for all the passengers"
11983,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,to hear; “I ain’t going to lose them; don’t I know how to take care of
11984,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,things? Give me the purse.” It was passed over without more words.
11985,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11986,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Take a quarter from the silver money,” the mother advised a moment"
11987,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,later.
11988,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11989,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“O, no, mamma! I want to give him a bill, to see if he makes the right"
11990,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"change. Here’s a five; that will do; no, let me see.” He jerked his"
11991,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"arm suddenly away from the mother’s hand, which reached after the"
11992,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"pocket-book, and several pieces of silver flew out and rolled around on"
11993,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,the floor.
11994,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11995,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“There!” he said, in a reproachful tone, “see what you have made me do;"
11996,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,now you have lost some of your money.”
11997,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
11998,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Pick it up, Harold, that’s a good boy.”"
11999,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12000,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"He stooped and picked up a twenty-five cent piece, then said:"
12001,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12002,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Never mind the rest. It has rolled round under the seat somewhere, and"
12003,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"it is all dust; I can’t get down on my knees and hunt; never mind, let"
12004,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"it go. Say, mamma, give me that box of candy.”"
12005,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12006,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Not now; I would rather you did not eat any more candy, Harold, until"
12007,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,we get home.”
12008,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12009,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Why not? I don’t want to wait; I haven’t eaten much. Come, it’s my"
12010,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"candy, and I want it. You bought it for me, and I think you are mean"
12011,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,not to let me have it.”
12012,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12013,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Hush, Harold! do not talk so loud. Hold your overcoat, dear; it is too"
12014,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,heavy for mamma.”
12015,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12016,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Oh! I can’t, it is too hot. I did not need that great big overcoat"
12017,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"anyhow, and I told you so. I’m not going to hold it. Drop it on the"
12018,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,floor if you don’t want to keep it. But give me that box of candy.
12019,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"O, mamma! there’s a procession coming down the street—soldiers, and"
12020,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,everything. I’m going out on the platform to see them.”
12021,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12022,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"He made a dash forward, and the pale, anxious mother reached after"
12023,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"him, trying to arrest his steps, dropping as she did so not only the"
12024,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"overcoat, but the pocket-book again. The pennies and the ten-cent"
12025,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"pieces rolled around freely, while Harold, looking behind him, gave a"
12026,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"mocking laugh, and was out on the platform."
12027,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12028,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,They had not been in the car over five minutes. And yet I was quite as
12029,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,well acquainted with Harold as I had any desire to be.
12030,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12031,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,At the North Street corner the pale little mother left the car with
12032,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"the heavy overcoat over one arm, and the pocket-book, with what change"
12033,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"she had been able to find, in her hand, while Harold, tugging at her"
12034,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"sleeve, was heard to say, “Mamma, I want that candy this minute!”"
12035,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12036,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"At Reed Street came three passengers, a boy about the size of the one"
12037,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"who had left us, and two little girls, one perhaps seven, and the other"
12038,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"not over four. The boy was freckled-faced, and by no means so handsome"
12039,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"as Harold. His clothes were very neat, but of the coarse, common"
12040,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,sort worn by children of the moderately poor. The little girls beside
12041,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,him were as neat as wax—faces and hands and hair in perfect order; but
12042,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,their sacks and hats were of last year’s fashion—perhaps older still
12043,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,than that—and I fancy Harold would have laughed outright at the little
12044,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,old overcoat which hung over the boy’s arm.
12045,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12046,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,[Illustration: A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE.]
12047,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12048,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"They took their seats quietly, and made no disturbance of any sort. But"
12049,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"there were so few in the car, and we were passing at that time through"
12050,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"such a quiet street, that I could hear distinctly the words they spoke"
12051,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,to one another.
12052,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12053,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Better put on your sack, Janie,” said the boy, with a thoughtful air,"
12054,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"looking at the older sister, “the wind blows in pretty strong here.”"
12055,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Janie immediately arose and began tugging at her sack. The boy, with"
12056,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"the manners of a gentleman accustomed to the work, took hold of it"
12057,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"at the shoulders and skillfully steered the little arms into place,"
12058,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"pulling it down behind, and bestowing meanwhile side glances upon the"
12059,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,little sister.
12060,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12061,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Sit still, Bessie, that’s a good girl. No, don’t stand, dear; mamma"
12062,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"wouldn’t like you to stand, the cars shake so.”"
12063,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12064,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Down sat Bessie again, trying to put herself squarely on the seat."
12065,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Failing in this her protector turned next to her, lifted her plump"
12066,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"little form into place, then straightened her hat and returned a"
12067,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,confiding smile which she gave him. Meantime the car was filling
12068,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"up, and in a few minutes every seat was taken. There came next a"
12069,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"middle-aged woman, black of face, and very shabby as to toilet, with a"
12070,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"market basket on her arm. Quick as thought the little gentleman arose,"
12071,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,and touching her arm motioned her to his seat. Then Janie reached
12072,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"forward for his overcoat. “Let me hold your overcoat, Charlie,” she"
12073,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"said, “because you haven’t any seat.”"
12074,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12075,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“O, no!” said Charlie, smiling back at her, “I can carry it as well as"
12076,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"not. Bessie dear, don’t climb up that way, you will fall.”"
12077,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12078,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Down sat Bessie, who had mounted on her fat little knees to look out of"
12079,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,the window.
12080,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12081,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"“Now, Janie,” said the little man at last, when they were near the"
12082,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Dean Street crossing, “we are to get out at this corner. I will take"
12083,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Bessie’s hand and go ahead, and you keep close to me. We will stand"
12084,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"still on the sidewalk until the car passes, then I will take you both"
12085,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,across.”
12086,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,
12087,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Away they went, and I watched them making their way carefully across"
12088,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"the crowded street, the brother’s arm thrown protectingly around"
12089,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"Bessie, and his eyes on the watch for any possible danger to either of"
12090,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,"his charges. I had made his acquaintance in five minutes, too, and knew"
12091,FIVE-MINUTE ACQUAINTANCES.,more about him than he would have imagined possible.

12150,A HAPPY BOY.,"HIS name is Willie Addis, and he lives in Plainfield, N. J. A few"
12151,A HAPPY BOY.,"weeks ago his mother turned down the wicks of her kerosene stove, and"
12152,A HAPPY BOY.,"leaned over it to blow out the flame, when the stove exploded, and in"
12153,A HAPPY BOY.,"an instant she was in flames. With one bound Willie was in the kitchen,"
12154,A HAPPY BOY.,"seizing the large woolen mat from the floor as he ran, and in less time"
12155,A HAPPY BOY.,"than it takes me to tell it, he had wrapped the mat about his mother"
12156,A HAPPY BOY.,"and extinguished the flames! The kitchen furniture was burned, but"
12157,A HAPPY BOY.,"that was about all, and the dear mother was saved by her quick-witted"
12158,A HAPPY BOY.,"ten-year-old son, who had heard somewhere that woolen wrapped closely"
12159,A HAPPY BOY.,"about a burning object so as to exclude the air, will put out the fire."
12160,A HAPPY BOY.,It is not every boy of his age who knows that fact; and there are many
12161,A HAPPY BOY.,"who, knowing it, would not have had presence of mind enough to have"
12162,A HAPPY BOY.,"applied their knowledge promptly. Willie did, and he has his mother."
12163,A HAPPY BOY.,"Certainly I think he must be a happy boy, and I am sure she is a glad,"

12179,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,If you do not have to go home too soon perhaps I will have time to tell
12180,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"you more than one; we will see. Oh! the children are to stay to tea,"
12181,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"are they? All right. Now, attention!"
12182,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12183,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,All those who would like to hear a story about a chicken—“a real truly
12184,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"story,” as the children say—wag your tails."
12185,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12186,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Those opposed, bark. Carried. The vote for the chicken story is about"
12187,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,unanimous.
12188,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12189,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I suppose some of you have very poor opinions of chickens and hens; you
12190,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"think because they have but two legs, and are so easily frightened,"
12191,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,they don’t amount to much; but the master and mistress think quite
12192,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,differently when they eat the nice fresh eggs which the hens furnish.
12193,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Why, some of those proud young crowers have hearts as well as we. I"
12194,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"remember so well a little old white blind hen which my master once had,"
12195,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and how kindly she was treated. (She could see just a little with one
12196,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"eye, but we called her blind.)"
12197,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12198,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"The young man who worked upon the place took a fancy to “Old Whitey,”"
12199,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"as they called her, and when master wanted to send her to market this"
12200,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"fellow pretended he couldn’t find her, so she was kept till very old."
12201,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12202,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,The gallant young crowers which roosted in the same shed with her would
12203,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"never fight this old “grandmother,” but were just as kind to her as"
12204,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,they knew how to be. Sometimes when one of them had found a nice lot of
12205,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"worms under something he had scratched over, “Whitey” would come along"
12206,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"hungry, and he would leave the nice mess for her, and look further for"
12207,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,himself.
12208,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12209,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,Was not that gallant and kind? Would all of you do as well as that? Be
12210,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,as unselfish?
12211,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12212,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,But this is not the chicken I was to tell you about. He was a poor
12213,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"orphan, his mother having died when he was but a little yellow ball"
12214,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,upon two little pins of legs.

12217,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12218,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I had not much to do with this pet, only as I visited his home"
12219,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"occasionally, and saw and played with him a little."
12220,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12221,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,It was my cousin Tip who had most to do with this bright feathered
12222,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"fellow, and to whom he was indebted for most of his education."
12223,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12224,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Tip was a great favorite; in fact, his mistress was fond of all sorts"
12225,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"of pets; had a name for each of her cows, and for every one of her"
12226,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"hens, so she had a name for this chicken."
12227,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12228,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Tip used to go about wherever he pleased, and so did the chicken. My"
12229,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"cousin was in the habit of taking almost anything he could find, and"
12230,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"dragging it to the spot where he wished to lie, then make a bed of it"
12231,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,and go to sleep.
12232,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12233,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,His little friend the chicken for awhile watched him with envious
12234,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,eyes—for I regret to say Cousin Tip was too selfish to provide a bed
12235,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,for any one besides himself.
12236,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12237,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"But this chicken evidently thought “what had been done could be done,”"
12238,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"so he asserted his independence, and gathered up what he could carry or"
12239,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"drag; put the articles—stockings, handkerchiefs or rags—in a heap near"
12240,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Tip’s bed, and would then tread them down as he had seen Tip do, and"
12241,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,squat upon them for a make-believe nap. Now wasn’t that a pretty bright
12242,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"chicken, and was not Tip a pretty successful teacher for one so young?"
12243,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12244,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"No, that lesson wouldn’t be much for a bright little dog to learn; but"
12245,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,we do not expect much intelligence in a hen or rooster.
12246,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12247,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,I suppose they cannot understand what people say to them as we do. And
12248,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,some people do not seem to think we understand what they tell us to do
12249,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"or not to do, even when they tell us we have done well."
12250,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12251,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"I remember so well when I was young, though almost as large as I am"
12252,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"now, how I astonished a lady by acting as though I understood what she"
12253,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,said to me.
12254,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12255,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"It was in the country, where the houses were quite a distance apart. I"
12256,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"had been caring for this woman’s little girl for more than a week, and"
12257,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"had kept her out of lots of mischief, and prevented her from getting"
12258,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"many an ugly fall, though I had never been asked to do it."
12259,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12260,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,One day little Cynthia (that was her name) wanted to go over to see her
12261,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"grandmother, who lived in the next house, nearly a quarter of a mile"
12262,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,away. The mother told her there was no one to go with her. She said she
12263,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"could go alone, and coaxed so hard that the mother said she might go."
12264,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"So Cynthia put her little hat on, and her mother kissed her good-by,"
12265,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"and she started. Then her mother turned to me and said: “Major, you go"
12266,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,with her and take good care of my darling; don’t you let anything hurt
12267,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,her.”
12268,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12269,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"How proud I was! I went right by her side all the way, and never left"
12270,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,her for one moment until she was safe at home.
12271,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12272,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"Then the lady called me a “good, faithful fellow,” and I was very"
12273,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,happy. But when the men came in at night and she told them what I had
12274,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"done, I felt ashamed to hear her say, “He acted just as though he knew"
12275,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,what I told him.”
12276,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,
12277,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"The idea! Why shouldn’t I understand, I would like to know? They talk"
12278,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"about things which I do not understand, but when they give me such a"
12279,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,"plain direction as that I guess I can hear it, and know what they mean,"
12280,MAJOR’S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.,too.

12298,A CAREFUL MOTHER.,the coming storm disturbed her. The amused watchers from the window
12299,A CAREFUL MOTHER.,"wondered why the leaf did not blow away, and finally reached out and"
12300,A CAREFUL MOTHER.,examined it; they found it hooked to a tiny stick which was just inside

12381,A RECIPE FOR A HAPPY DAY.,
12382,MY DEAR BIRDS:,MY DEAR BIRDS:
12383,MY DEAR BIRDS:,
12384,MY DEAR BIRDS:,“I watched you last Wednesday evening in the mid-week
12385,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"prayer meeting, and none of you moved your lips, even"
12386,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"when we sang ‘Rock of Ages’ and ‘Jesus, Lover of my"
12387,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"Soul.’ The singing was weak and languid and thin, when"
12388,MY DEAR BIRDS:,your voices might have put body and life and strength
12389,MY DEAR BIRDS:,into it. I know that you can sing if you have a mind
12390,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"to, for do I not hear you every Sunday in the church"
12391,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"choir? . . . Did I not hear you sing, too, at Miss Flora"
12392,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"McFlimsey’s birthday party the other evening? Yes,"
12393,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"indeed; you gathered around the piano, and the way"
12394,MY DEAR BIRDS:,you warbled forth the glees and college songs did my
12395,MY DEAR BIRDS:,heart good. But there you were at the church prayer
12396,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"meeting, members of the church, members of the Society"
12397,MY DEAR BIRDS:,of Christian Endeavor; you had promised more than once
12398,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"to do your duty faithfully, and yet you kept still,"
12399,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"simply because the singing wasn’t very artistic, or"
12400,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"because somebody behind you ‘screeched so,’ as you"
12401,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"inelegantly expressed it, or because the old deacon on"
12402,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"the front seat dragged, and ‘put you all out.’ Now, my"
12403,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"dear birds, pardon the plain words of an old man, and"
12404,MY DEAR BIRDS:,your pastor at that. The prayer meeting singing is just
12405,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"as important a part of worship, and just as acceptable"
12406,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"in God’s sight, as your choir or solo singing with all"
12407,MY DEAR BIRDS:,its frills and furbelows. The ‘screecher’ and the old
12408,MY DEAR BIRDS:,deacon are both doing the best they can; and if you
12409,MY DEAR BIRDS:,did the best you could their voices would not be so
12410,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"prominent, and the music would be far better. Then,"
12411,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"too, do you not think it indicates a little touch of"
12412,MY DEAR BIRDS:,conceit to sing only when your voices will show off to
12413,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"advantage, and let the poor prayer meeting suffer for"
12414,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"lack of them? I am sure, my dear birds, that you never"
12415,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"thought of the matter in that light, for after all you"
12416,MY DEAR BIRDS:,mean to be conscientious as well as tuneful birds; and
12417,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"I am quite confident that when, next Wednesday evening,"
12418,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"I give out ‘Rock of Ages,’ you will ‘raise it’ on your"
12419,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"clear strong voices, and give the prayer meeting such a"
12420,MY DEAR BIRDS:,start and uplift as it has not had for many a day.”
12421,MY DEAR BIRDS:,
12422,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"I did not mean to quote it all, but it was so good I could not find a"
12423,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"place to stop. I think you will enjoy it, and so will mamma, or your"
12424,MY DEAR BIRDS:,"older sister, or indeed any one who loves to read bright, pure, helpful"

12489,BY THE PANSIES.,THE biggest thing in St. Louis is the bridge by which you get to it. It
12490,BY THE PANSIES.,"has three arches, each over five hundred feet long, and it makes a road"
12491,BY THE PANSIES.,"over fifty feet wide. My uncle says it is a big thing, and he knows,"
12492,BY THE PANSIES.,"for he is a bridge builder. There is a tunnel under it, and a railroad"
12493,BY THE PANSIES.,track. I rode into St. Louis once through this tunnel; it is a mile
12494,BY THE PANSIES.,"long. It is lighted with electricity, and they say it has ventilating"
12495,BY THE PANSIES.,"shafts; but they don’t give you much air to breathe, that I know."

12499,BY THE PANSIES.,"it. But for all that it is a splendid thing—the tunnel is, I mean. The"
12500,BY THE PANSIES.,"piers of the bridge are built on a rock, and they go down more than a"

12510,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"I cannot find out about St. Louis, but I know the first settlement"
12511,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,there was made by Pierre Laclede Liguest. I was wondering if they did
12512,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"not put pieces of his queer name together, and make a word which in"
12513,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"time came to be St. Louis? Anyhow, I am glad they did not name the"
12514,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"place for him, it would have been so hard to pronounce. That is only"
12515,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,about a hundred and thirty years ago. St. Louis did not grow very fast;
12516,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"for a long time nobody thought it was going to be a city, and fifty"
12517,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,years ago there were only about sixteen thousand inhabitants; but it
12518,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,has grown fast enough since. There are more than five hundred thousand
12519,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"people there now, and large, beautiful buildings, and everything which"
12520,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"helps to make a city handsome. It is hot there, though; at least my"
12521,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,auntie thinks so. She used to have to wait three hours in a St. Louis
12522,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"depot for a train every time she came home for her summer vacation, and"
12523,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"went back in September, and she says the warmest she has ever been in"
12524,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,her life was during those hours; and she never in five years struck a
12525,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,cool day! So she says she cannot help thinking that St. Louis is always
12526,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"warm. But probably if she had been there in January, instead of June or"
12527,WILLARD J. MOONEY.,"September, she would have thought differently. Women are apt to think"

12537,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"has other names, “The Missouri Botanical Gardens,” and “Tower Grove"
12538,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"Park,” which is a piece of the gardens, but when I was there everybody"
12539,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"said “Shaw’s Garden.” The land was presented by Mr. Henry Shaw, an"
12540,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"Englishman, and he used to keep the lovely great park in order at his"
12541,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,own expense; I don’t know whether he does now or not. There are more
12542,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,than two hundred and fifty acres just in Tower Grove Park. I have never
12543,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"been to Central Park, that some of the Pansies told about, but I do not"
12544,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,see how it could be prettier than Tower Grove Park. There is a statue
12545,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"of Shakespeare, and another of Humboldt in the park, and they cost"
12546,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,over a million of dollars. I don’t see why; I didn’t admire them very
12547,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,much; but that is what the gentleman said who went with us. There are
12548,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,"a great many other parks in St. Louis—about twenty, I think—but none"

12550,ROBERT CAMPBELL.,the finest collection of plants of any city in the United States. My

12630,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12631,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,ELISE was spending the afternoon with Miss Dora Turner. Miss Turner
12632,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"was several years older than Elise, but she had come to the country to"
12633,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"live among strangers, and Elise had known her in her city home, and was"
12634,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"lonely like herself, so they became intimate friends. Elise told all"
12635,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"her sorrows and perplexities, as well as her joys, to this young lady."
12636,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"She was in Miss Turner’s room now, waiting for her to rearrange her"
12637,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"hair and make some additions to her toilet, then they were going for a"
12638,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,walk.
12639,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12640,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“I don’t know where we can go, I am sure,” said Elise; “we have used"
12641,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,up all the pretty walks near by. I wish it was early enough to go for
12642,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,a long tramp; I would like to do something different this afternoon. I
12643,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,feel tired of all the things I ever did.”
12644,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12645,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Poor little old lady!” said Miss Turner, laughing, “there will have to"
12646,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"be a new world made for you, Elise.” Then, as she turned, she caught"
12647,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"the flash of the diamond at Elise’s throat, and said: “How lovely your"
12648,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,pin is! It seems too lovely and too costly for a young girl.”
12649,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12650,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“It was mamma’s,” said Elise gravely, “and papa promised mamma he would"
12651,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,give it to me on my fourteenth birthday. Didn’t I tell you?”
12652,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12653,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Why, no, indeed. That explains it. I wondered that your father should"
12654,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,send you a diamond pin at your age; but it is beautiful for you to have
12655,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"your mother’s pin to wear. Why didn’t you tell me, Elise?”"
12656,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12657,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Because,” said Elise, “there was a part to it that I did not"
12658,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"understand, and I suppose I did not want to speak of it. Mamma sent me"
12659,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,a message with it; at least papa said that the words inside were her
12660,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"message; she had them engraved on it before she died, so it seems like"
12661,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"mamma’s last words to me, and indeed it is; but I do not understand it,"
12662,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"nor know how to do it, nor anything. I don’t suppose you could show me?”"
12663,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12664,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"The question was asked with a half-laugh, and not at all as though"
12665,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,Elise supposed that she could get any help from this quarter.
12666,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12667,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Miss Turner’s fair face flushed. “I don’t suppose I could,” she"
12668,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"answered gravely; “I don’t know much about such things, Elise.”"
12669,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12670,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,What she meant by “such things” perhaps would have been difficult for
12671,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"her to explain. But the thought in her mind was, that “last messages”"
12672,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,from dying mothers would not be such as she could explain. Elise’s
12673,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,mother had been dead for many years; at least they seemed many to
12674,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Elise, though she could remember her beautiful mother distinctly;"
12675,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"and when she thought it all over, as she often did in the twilight,"
12676,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"could seem to feel her mother’s kiss upon her lips, and the pressure"
12677,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,of her mother’s hand on the yellow curls which used to be hers in
12678,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"those days. She was not yet six years old when her mother went away,"
12679,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,but there were times when it seemed to her that she had seen her only
12680,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,yesterday. And at other times the years which stretched between seemed
12681,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"very, very long. Her father was in India in the Government employ; had"
12682,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"been there for five years. And Elise, who received long letters from"
12683,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"him, and elegant presents, and talked a great deal about him, yet felt"
12684,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,sometimes that she really knew him less than she did her beautiful pale
12685,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"mother, who used to love her so, and kiss her so tenderly. Elise lived"
12686,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"with an aunt who was very fond of her, and did everything to supply"
12687,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"her mother’s place, and her uncle called her his adopted daughter;"
12688,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"yet sometimes she cried when she was tucked up in bed for the night,"
12689,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"because she longed so to have a mamma and papa and a home of her own,"
12690,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,like other girls. It was perhaps because Miss Turner had no mother that
12691,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,she had felt drawn toward her in the first place.
12692,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12693,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“What is the message?” her friend asked. “May I see it, Elise? I am"
12694,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,half-surprised that you do not understand it; you are such a thoughtful
12695,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"young person, and seem older than you are; I have a feeling that you"
12696,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,can understand what most others do.”
12697,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12698,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,Elise made no reply save to unclasp the pin and pass it to her friend.
12699,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Miss Turner moved toward the window, where the light would fall upon"
12700,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"it. It was a lovely arch of gold, a tiny diamond flashing in its"
12701,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"center, and on the reverse side was engraved, in small but distinct"
12702,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"letters, the words: “Keep His covenant.” “Why, Elise!” she said, “how"
12703,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,beautiful this is. I should think you would like it very much.”
12704,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12705,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“I do,” said Elise, “of course; only it gives me a strange feeling, as"
12706,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,though mamma had sent me word to do something that I could not do; and
12707,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"I have always thought that I would like to do things to please mamma,"
12708,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,if I only knew just what she wanted done.”
12709,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12710,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Well, but, dear,” said Miss Turner hesitatingly, “surely you can find"
12711,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"out what this means, in a general way.”"
12712,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12713,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Elise smiled sadly. “I remember mamma very well,” she said, “and she"
12714,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,always wanted me to do exactly as she said.”
12715,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12716,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Well,” said Miss Turner again, after an embarrassed pause, “this is"
12717,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"exact enough; she means you to live a good life, you know.”"
12718,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12719,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“I don’t know what it means,” said Elise, moving restlessly. “As for"
12720,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"being good, I am not, and I don’t know how to be; I cannot keep my"
12721,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,temper a single day. You know I never get through a day without having
12722,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,a tiff of some sort with Cousin Annie; and there are ever so many
12723,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,people who vex me and worry me so that I cannot feel right toward them.
12724,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"That is not being good. Besides, the words seem to me to mean something"
12725,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,more than that—something different. I would like to know exactly what
12726,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"they mean, but there is nobody that I can ask. Papa does not understand"
12727,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"such things, and uncle and auntie do not. I don’t seem to have any"
12728,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,friends who could help in that way.”
12729,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12730,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Miss Turner gave back the pin, looking very thoughtful indeed. She"
12731,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"ought to know more about those things than Elise did, she told herself;"
12732,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"her father was not a Christian, and her mother had died when her"
12733,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"little girl was six years old, whereas Miss Turner had lived always in"
12734,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"a home where the father and mother were earnest Christians, and she"
12735,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,knew at this very moment that the greatest desire of their hearts was
12736,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,to see her doing this very thing—“keeping His covenant.” Yet she knew
12737,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"as little about it practically as Elise Burton did; so little, that"
12738,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"although she was at least six years older than Elise, she did not know"
12739,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,in the least how to help her this afternoon. It was very humiliating.
12740,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"She could help her with her music, and with her French lessons, and"
12741,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"her drawing, and to have this most important of all lessons beyond her,"
12742,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"seemed strange and wrong. She was still for several minutes, then she"
12743,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"said, speaking very gently:"
12744,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12745,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Elise dear, I can imagine how you feel with this message from your"
12746,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,mother; I wish I knew how to help you. But there is a way to learn what
12747,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,it means. There is a verse in the Bible somewhere that explains its
12748,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,meaning.”
12749,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12750,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,Elise looked up quickly. “Where?” she asked. “The Bible is such a big
12751,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"book, and I do not know much about it. I did try last Sunday to find"
12752,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,something about covenants that would help me. I went away back to Noah
12753,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"and the rainbow, but I did not get any good out of it for me.”"
12754,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12755,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,Miss Dora went to her table and took up an elegantly bound reference
12756,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"Bible, full of help which she did not understand, and turning in a"
12757,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"half-bewildered, half-embarrassed manner to the Concordance, ran"
12758,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,her eye down the list of words marked “covenant.” Elise watched her
12759,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"curiously. She had no Concordance in her Bible, and did not know how to"
12760,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,use one. At last Miss Dora turned to a verse.
12761,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12762,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“This explains a little of it,” she said, and read aloud: “This shall"
12763,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel in those
12764,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"days, saith the Lord; I will put my law in their inward parts, and"
12765,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"write it in their hearts, and will be their God and they shall be my"
12766,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,people.” As she read a curious light came into her eyes.
12767,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12768,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“It is very strange,” she said; “that is the verse that they are going"
12769,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,to talk about this afternoon at the covenant meeting.”
12770,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12771,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,“What is a covenant meeting?” asked Elise eagerly.
12772,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12773,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,“It is the young people’s quarterly meeting at the church where I am
12774,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,attending. Every three months their Christian Endeavor Society have a
12775,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,gathering which they call a covenant meeting. I don’t know much about
12776,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,it; I have not been; but they talk together about such things; the
12777,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,pastor comes and talks to them. They say the meetings are interesting.
12778,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"What if we should walk in that direction, Elise, and go in a little"
12779,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"while? Mr. Westfield invited me to come, but I did not have an idea"
12780,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"that I should do so. I do not attend such meetings much, you know. But"
12781,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"if you would like to go, Elise, and find out about your pin, I will go"
12782,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,with you.”
12783,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12784,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“Well,” said Elise, starting up with more energy than she had shown"
12785,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"before for several days, “I will. I want to know about ‘His covenant.’"
12786,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"I do, truly. Mamma asked me to, you know; and perhaps if I understood"
12787,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"it it would tell me just exactly what she wanted me to do all the time,"
12788,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,and I should be so glad to do it.”
12789,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12790,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"“We will go and find out,” said Miss Turner gravely."
12791,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,
12792,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,Thus the little seed dropped by the loving mother’s hand took root and
12793,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,"blossomed in two lives, though the hand which sowed the seed had been"
12794,A SEED THAT BLOSSOMED.,dust for many years.

12808,A SCARECROW.,ALEX HAINES and Eva were promised a piece of ground as their very own
12809,A SCARECROW.,if they would cultivate (what is that?) it.
12810,A SCARECROW.,
12811,A SCARECROW.,Each took a hoe and began. By night Alex and Eva had planted a rod
12812,A SCARECROW.,square to corn.
12813,A SCARECROW.,
12814,A SCARECROW.,"Then they watched the corn; that is, they watched for the corn. After"
12815,A SCARECROW.,"a few days, sure enough, the spots where the corn was planted—that is,"
12816,A SCARECROW.,the hills—began to swell as though something wanted to get out. Then up
12817,A SCARECROW.,"came a bit of a green leaf. Higher it grew, and they came often to see"
12818,A SCARECROW.,it.
12819,A SCARECROW.,
12820,A SCARECROW.,"One day they came and found some of the hills pulled up, and while they"
12821,A SCARECROW.,"wondered what thief had been about, they heard from the top of a tree,"
12822,A SCARECROW.,"“Caw, caw, caw!”"
12823,A SCARECROW.,
12824,A SCARECROW.,The thief was a crow.
12825,A SCARECROW.,
12826,A SCARECROW.,"So they must scare the crows away, or the corn will be all pulled up,"
12827,A SCARECROW.,and their labor will be in vain.
12828,A SCARECROW.,
12829,A SCARECROW.,Crows are afraid of men; but men cannot stay all the time in the field
12830,A SCARECROW.,to scare the crows off. So something that looks like a man must be set
12831,A SCARECROW.,up in the corn patch to scare the crows away.
12832,A SCARECROW.,
12833,A SCARECROW.,"With a pair of pants, a coat, a hat, and three old brooms, they are"

12874,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12875,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“THERE!” said Davie Campbell, flinging as he spoke a large,"
12876,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"sharp-pointed stick right where his brother stood, “take that; I don’t"
12877,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"care if it does hurt you. I hate you, George Campbell!”"
12878,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12879,A DOUBLE LESSON.,The stick was aimed even more surely than Davie in his blind rage
12880,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"imagined. It struck his brother’s side face, making an ugly wound, from"
12881,A DOUBLE LESSON.,which the blood flowed freely.
12882,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12883,A DOUBLE LESSON.,[Illustration: SHE HELD UP A WARNING HAND.]
12884,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12885,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“Ah, ha!” said George, as he turned to the pump and began to bathe the"
12886,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"wound, “look what you have done now. What will mother say to you, young"
12887,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"man? And as for me, that will make a scar, and I will wear it all my"
12888,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"life to remember you by. You will like that, won’t you? You will just"
12889,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"enjoy having people ask me where I got that scar, and me having to tell"
12890,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"that my beloved brother did it on purpose, because he hated me. Oh, ho!"
12891,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"you are a jewel, you are,” and George Campbell laughed, and dodged"
12892,A DOUBLE LESSON.,just in time to escape a stone from his angry brother’s hand; then went
12893,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"off down the street, leaving Davie in a perfect rage."
12894,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12895,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"He was three years younger than his brother, and was said by the"
12896,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"neighbors to have a great deal worse disposition than George, but"
12897,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"I never felt sure of that. However, it is quite true that instead"
12898,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"of being master of his temper he let it master him. He had, also, a"
12899,A DOUBLE LESSON.,wretched habit of throwing anything he might happen to have in his hand
12900,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"when the angry fit seized him, letting it strike wherever it might. In"
12901,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"this way he had narrowly escaped doing serious mischief, and he had"
12902,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"promised himself hundreds of times that he would never, never throw"
12903,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"things again, and yet, as soon as he grew angry, so settled was that"
12904,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"habit upon him, that the stick or stone was apt to fly through the air."
12905,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"As for George, I think he was quite as easily angered as his brother,"
12906,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"but his habit was to laugh, or sneer, or say the most taunting words"
12907,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"imaginable, with a sort of superior smile on his face the while. On the"
12908,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"whole, I am not sure that George appeared any better in the sight of"
12909,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Him who can read hearts than did his brother Davie.
12910,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12911,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"They were not the worst boys in the world, by any means; they did not"
12912,A DOUBLE LESSON.,quarrel all the time. For days together they would succeed in being
12913,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"very friendly, and in having good times, but it must be confessed that"
12914,A DOUBLE LESSON.,George had discovered certain directions in which his young brother
12915,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"could be easily teased, and that he delighted to tease him."
12916,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12917,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“Davie is such a little spitfire,” he used to say to his Aunt Mary,"
12918,A DOUBLE LESSON.,when she argued with him about the sin of such a habit. “Why does he
12919,A DOUBLE LESSON.,want to go off like a pop gun the first word that is said to him? I
12920,A DOUBLE LESSON.,never do.”
12921,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12922,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“No,” said Aunt Mary; “you laugh—a laugh which makes him feel more"
12923,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"angry than he did before, and you say something to increase his rage."
12924,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Is that really being any better than he?” But these questions George
12925,A DOUBLE LESSON.,did not like to answer.
12926,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12927,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"On this particular morning, after having stopped the blood from his"
12928,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"wound, he had sauntered away to see two of his friends who worked in"
12929,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the paper factory near at hand. There he mounted their work table and
12930,A DOUBLE LESSON.,answered the questions which they eagerly put to him as to how he
12931,A DOUBLE LESSON.,happened to get hurt.
12932,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12933,A DOUBLE LESSON.,“Oh! it is Davie’s work; he’s a great boy. If he had had an open
12934,A DOUBLE LESSON.,jack-knife in his hand it would have been all the same; it would have
12935,A DOUBLE LESSON.,been flung at me when he got mad. I hope when he grows up he will never
12936,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"take a notion to carry a pistol, for if he does he will shoot the first"
12937,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"fellow who laughs at him, or who laughs when he is within hearing.”"
12938,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12939,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“Why, George,” said one of the boys, “that will make an ugly scar.”"
12940,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12941,A DOUBLE LESSON.,“I dare say it will. I will carry it all my life to remember him by.”
12942,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12943,A DOUBLE LESSON.,“It is a pity that he is such a little tiger; I wouldn’t stand it if I
12944,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"were you,” said the other boy. “You are a good deal older than he; why"
12945,A DOUBLE LESSON.,don’t you make him behave himself?”
12946,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12947,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"In this way poor Davie was discussed by the three, George telling story"
12948,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"after story about his brother, led on by the sympathy which the two"
12949,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"professed, into making Davie the one always to blame, and himself the"
12950,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"injured, long-suffering elder brother. The boys did not know Davie very"
12951,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"well, and George had always been good-natured with them, so of course"
12952,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"they were on his side, and ready to sympathize with him for having such"
12953,A DOUBLE LESSON.,a wicked little brother. The longer George talked the more of a martyr
12954,A DOUBLE LESSON.,he grew to considering himself; he racked his brain for illustrations
12955,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"of Davie’s ill temper, and was in the midst of a very harrowing story"
12956,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"when Joe Winters appeared, breathless with running, and panted out:"
12957,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“Is George Campbell here? I say, George Campbell, your folks want"
12958,A DOUBLE LESSON.,you to come home just as fast as you can. Davie has tumbled from the
12959,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"scaffolding of the big barn and killed himself! or—well, he ain’t dead;"
12960,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"but he lies there still; can’t stir nor speak, and they have sent for"
12961,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"two doctors, and everybody thinks he is going to die.”"
12962,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12963,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Poor George Campbell! To have seen the look on his face when he heard
12964,A DOUBLE LESSON.,this dreadful piece of news you would not have imagined that he could
12965,A DOUBLE LESSON.,have had so hard an opinion of his little brother as he had been
12966,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"trying to show for the last hour. He jumped from the table, and made a"
12967,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"dash for the door before Joe had finished his panting sentences, but"
12968,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"paused with the door in his hand to say: “O, boys! it isn’t half of it"
12969,A DOUBLE LESSON.,true—what I have been telling you; I have been worse than Davie every
12970,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"time. If I hadn’t laughed at him, and teased him, and made fun of him,"
12971,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"he never would have got angry at me. O, boys! if he dies it will kill"
12972,A DOUBLE LESSON.,me.” Then he ran.
12973,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12974,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"What hours those were which followed, while the little brother lay on"
12975,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"his bed, moaning steadily, but unconscious, so the doctors declared,"
12976,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"and they shook their heads gravely in answer to questions, and would"
12977,A DOUBLE LESSON.,not give one ray of hope that he might by and by open his eyes and know
12978,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"them. Truth to tell, they thought he was going to die, and that very"
12979,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"soon. But doctors are sometimes mistaken, and these were. Davie did not"
12980,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"die; he lay day after day moaning with pain, not knowing any of the"
12981,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"dear friends who bent over him; staring at George with wild, unnatural"
12982,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"eyes, as if he were some comical object, instead of the brother who"
12983,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"hovered about him, longing, oh! so eagerly for just one glance of"
12984,A DOUBLE LESSON.,recognition.
12985,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
12986,A DOUBLE LESSON.,There came a day when the doctors said it was possible—just barely
12987,A DOUBLE LESSON.,possible—that Davie might awaken from the long sleep into which he
12988,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"had fallen, and know his friends. How still they kept the house, and"
12989,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"how silently the mother sat hour after hour by his bedside, relieved"
12990,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"only by the little sister, who came on tiptoe to take her place, that"
12991,A DOUBLE LESSON.,she might go out and drink a cup of tea to help her bear the nervous
12992,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"strain. Even then she only went into the next room, separated from"
12993,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"Davie’s by a curtain, and came back when she had got half-way across"
12994,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the room because she thought she heard a sound behind those curtains.
12995,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"There was no sound; Jennie was sitting quietly at her post, a wise"
12996,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"little nurse; she held up a warning hand, ready to motion anybody back"
12997,A DOUBLE LESSON.,into silence who might be tiptoeing toward them. She had imagined it
12998,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"was George, for he, poor fellow, hovered near, looking almost as pale"
12999,A DOUBLE LESSON.,and worn as the boy with his head on the pillow.
13000,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13001,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Terrible days these had been to George. He was not sure that he ever
13002,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"prayed in his life before, but during those days he prayed with"
13003,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"terrible earnestness, that Davie might not go away with those last"
13004,A DOUBLE LESSON.,words of his ringing in his ears. “If he could only know me long enough
13005,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"for me to ask him to forgive me!” said poor George to himself, while"
13006,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the tears rolled down his cheeks. “Then I think I would be almost
13007,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"willing to have him die. O, God! let me just tell him that I am sorry,"
13008,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"and that I will not remember him in any such way, but I will think of"
13009,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the thousands of good and loving things he has done for me.”
13010,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13011,A DOUBLE LESSON.,[Illustration: AT PONT NEUF.]
13012,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13013,A DOUBLE LESSON.,I am sure you will be glad to know that his prayer was answered. Davie
13014,A DOUBLE LESSON.,awoke from his long sleep with a look of quiet astonishment in his
13015,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"eyes, to think that he was lying in bed, and mother and Jennie were"
13016,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"sitting beside him, and that George was standing over by the window. He"
13017,A DOUBLE LESSON.,did not remember any of the days that had passed between. He did not
13018,A DOUBLE LESSON.,remember at first the fall from the scaffolding. He was by no means out
13019,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"of danger, the doctor said, yet there was a thread, just a thread of"
13020,A DOUBLE LESSON.,hope that he might rally. And so the days which followed were quite as
13021,A DOUBLE LESSON.,full of anxiety and care as those in which he had been unconscious.
13022,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13023,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"But Davie steadily gained, and there came a bright morning in midsummer"
13024,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"when George was permitted to take care of him alone, while his mother"
13025,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"attended to some household duties, and Jennie swept the dining-room"
13026,A DOUBLE LESSON.,and set the table. It was George’s opportunity. He had longed for
13027,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"it, but he did not know how to use it. How should he begin? While he"
13028,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"considered, Davie began for him."
13029,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13030,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“It did leave a scar, didn’t it?” he said mournfully. “O, George! I"
13031,A DOUBLE LESSON.,remember all about it; it came to me just a few days ago. Wasn’t it
13032,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"awful? George, the hardest part has been to think that maybe I should"
13033,A DOUBLE LESSON.,die and leave that scar for you to remember me by.”
13034,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13035,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“Don’t,” said George, who had not the least idea that he should cry any"
13036,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"more about this thing, yet who felt the tears starting in his eyes. “O,"
13037,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"don’t, Davie! forget those horrid hateful things I said to you. You"
13038,A DOUBLE LESSON.,can’t think how many nice things I had to remember of you—hundreds and
13039,A DOUBLE LESSON.,hundreds of them.”
13040,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13041,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“No,” said Davie mournfully; “I have always been throwing sticks and"
13042,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"stones and hurting things. Don’t you remember how I lamed the cat, and"
13043,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"killed a bird once, and then made that scar on your face? That is the"
13044,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"worst of all. O, George! if I had died what a way to be remembered."
13045,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Think of the lots of things that people could have told of me like
13046,A DOUBLE LESSON.,that.”
13047,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13048,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"George winced visibly, for these were some of the things he had told"
13049,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the boys in the paper factory that day.
13050,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13051,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“I tell you what it is,” he said, swallowing hard to try and speak"
13052,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"without a tremble in his voice, “you and I have both had a lesson,"
13053,A DOUBLE LESSON.,Davie. If you had died I could never have forgiven myself for having
13054,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"teased you for getting angry, and then having said that I would"
13055,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"remember you by this little scar, which doesn’t amount to anything,"
13056,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"anyhow. It wasn’t true, Davie; I wouldn’t have remembered you that way.”"
13057,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13058,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“I don’t see how you could have helped it,” said Davie mournfully; “but"
13059,A DOUBLE LESSON.,I am truly and surely going to be different after this. If you see me
13060,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"getting angry and acting as if I was going to throw things, I wish you"
13061,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"would tie up my hands, or hold them, or something.”"
13062,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13063,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"“We will both be different,” said George. “It won’t do to plan such"
13064,A DOUBLE LESSON.,things as we had to remember. We will begin now and plan to have nice
13065,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"pleasant things, so that when—that when”—But his voice trembled and"
13066,A DOUBLE LESSON.,broke; he had been too near parting with Davie forever to put in words
13067,A DOUBLE LESSON.,the thought that some time the parting would surely come.
13068,A DOUBLE LESSON.,
13069,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"But I fancy that they must have kept their words and begun over again,"
13070,A DOUBLE LESSON.,for this happened several years ago. George and Davie are young men
13071,A DOUBLE LESSON.,"now, and yesterday I heard them called “model brothers.” They really"
13072,A DOUBLE LESSON.,seem to be planning to have only pleasant things to remember of each
13073,A DOUBLE LESSON.,other when the time comes for one of them to go away.

13135,JEAN.,
13136,JEAN.,"But after six days sightseeing we’ll hurry to another place, and here"

13139,JEAN.,"There on that grassy bank where the flowers are blooming, and at whose"

13141,JEAN.,sat upon that very spot nearly five hundred years ago and watched her
13142,JEAN.,father’s flock of sheep or listened to the singing birds or talked with
13143,JEAN.,God through the sweet roses she holds. Now she looks up at the great
13144,JEAN.,"sun, now at a passing cloud; now a soft wind fans her face; a shepherd"
13145,JEAN.,dog lies at her feet; just yonder some lambs are nestled together.
13146,JEAN.,
13147,JEAN.,"She is but thirteen years old, but she loves to speak to God as though"
13148,JEAN.,he were by her side—and is he not?
13149,JEAN.,
13150,JEAN.,Late one evening she comes leading the sheep home. Sitting alone
13151,JEAN.,"looking out into the moonlight, Jeanne’s mother inquires: “My child,"
13152,JEAN.,"what keeps you so long in the field? You must come home earlier, my"
13153,JEAN.,"darling, or something will happen to you.”"
13154,JEAN.,
13155,JEAN.,"“But, mamma, I’ve heard voices in the fields, and they seem to come"
13156,JEAN.,"from the roses and the rocks and the robins and in every wind, and they"
13157,JEAN.,"tell me of my native land and my home and God, that I must love _ma"
13158,JEAN.,"belle France_, and save it out of the hands of all its enemies, and"
13159,JEAN.,"this is what keeps me so late, my sweet, dear mamma.”"
13160,JEAN.,
13161,JEAN.,"“Voices, child?”"
13162,JEAN.,
13163,JEAN.,"“Aye, mamma, voices from Heaven speaking in my heart. Your Jeanne hears"
13164,JEAN.,"them loud, in my heart, at least, and they say I must save my poor sad"
13165,JEAN.,country.”
13166,JEAN.,
13167,JEAN.,"Jeanne’s mother could say nothing, but wonder if the child was out of"
13168,JEAN.,"her mind, or if she had really had a vision of angels, as in olden"
13169,JEAN.,times they came to the shepherds while they watched their flocks.
13170,JEAN.,
13171,JEAN.,"So the years went by, Jeanne always saying that these heavenly voices"
13172,JEAN.,"were calling her to save her unhappy country, her friends and neighbors"
13173,JEAN.,sometimes calling her crazy.
13174,JEAN.,
13175,JEAN.,"She was now seventeen, a lovely pure girl, sorrowing much over the wars"
13176,JEAN.,and troubles of her own beloved France. Ah! they were dark days indeed;
13177,JEAN.,"this one wanted to be king, and that one said he must rule; armies"
13178,JEAN.,"met and fought, and some of the young men who went from Domremy, and"
13179,JEAN.,"with whom Jeanne had played, were brought back from the battle fields"
13180,JEAN.,wounded and dying.
13181,JEAN.,
13182,JEAN.,"Then came a great army over from England, and city after city of France"
13183,JEAN.,fell before its awful march. The frightened King Charles the Seventh
13184,JEAN.,feared all was lost. He knew not whither to fly with his sad little
13185,JEAN.,army. But just when he was going to give up word came to him about the
13186,JEAN.,"girl of Domremy, our sweet Jeanne. Quickly a messenger was dispatched"
13187,JEAN.,"to her plain little home, and out into the fields he hastened to find"
13188,JEAN.,her feeding her flock. He urged her to come to her king with all speed.
13189,JEAN.,She knew what it meant; she knew her hour was now come to save her “_la
13190,JEAN.,belle France_.”
13191,JEAN.,
13192,JEAN.,"Bidding her mother to pray for her, and covering her neck with kisses,"
13193,JEAN.,she was soon galloping off with the messenger to the camp of the king.
13194,JEAN.,A smile of hope lit up his anxious face as she came into his presence.
13195,JEAN.,"She told him about the “voices,” and said she was sure she could lead"
13196,JEAN.,his army to victory if he would give her soldiers.
13197,JEAN.,
13198,JEAN.,"So then and there he put upon her the strong armor of commander, and"
13199,JEAN.,giving her a sword and a war horse she led her little band against the
13200,JEAN.,"English. They had heard of her, and thought she was sent of God, and"
13201,JEAN.,"fear fell upon them, and they threw down their arms and fled away in"
13202,JEAN.,dismay.
13203,JEAN.,
13204,JEAN.,"Meanwhile, though Jeanne waved her flashing sword she never struck a"
13205,JEAN.,"blow with it, but she was again and again wounded."
13206,JEAN.,
13207,JEAN.,"At last came complete victory, and Jeanne saw the enemies of her"
13208,JEAN.,beloved France fleeing from Orleans before her rejoicing army. For this
13209,JEAN.,"she was called “_La Pucelle d’Orleans_,” or the Maid of Orleans. But"
13210,JEAN.,she is usually called Joan of Arc.
13211,JEAN.,
13212,JEAN.,After so much triumph she pleaded with her king to let her return to
13213,JEAN.,"her dear Domremy home, but he would not consent. Meanwhile some of the"
13214,JEAN.,"great captains envied her all her victories, and managed to let her"
13215,JEAN.,"be taken prisoner. Now comes the sad, sad thing to tell. After this"
13216,JEAN.,"noble girl had saved her country, her king and the others let her be"
13217,JEAN.,"put into prison, tried, condemned, and burned to death as a witch! This"
13218,JEAN.,is not the only case in which the best friend a country ever had was
13219,JEAN.,"cruelly treated by that country. Jesus was crucified, crucified by his"
13220,JEAN.,"own people, whom he came to save. But scarcely had twenty years gone"
13221,JEAN.,by before all the bitter persecutors of this dear brave Jeanne came
13222,JEAN.,"to violent deaths, and the people, instead of calling her a witch,"
13223,JEAN.,"proclaimed her innocent, and a statue was erected to her memory on the"
13224,JEAN.,"very spot where she was burned, and her family was promoted by the king."

13360,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13361,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“I suppose it cannot be arranged,” said Mrs. Foster. “I must finish"

13367,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Perhaps she can run down there after tea to see how the baby is,”"

13372,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13373,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"It was Agatha’s turn to sigh. “We need a second girl,” she said; “it is"

13376,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13377,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“We shall certainly have to get along,” was her mother’s answer, spoken"

13381,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Meantime Celia, her fingers still busy with the masses of flowers she"

13384,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13385,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"It was Sabbath evening in her thoughts, and she was in the Christian"
13386,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Endeavor meeting, listening to Agatha’s voice while she quoted from"
13387,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,some grand old writer a thought like this: “We plan our Easter
13388,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"offerings, and beautify His temple for the glad day, and that is well;"
13389,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,but we are to remember that as there would have been no Easter had He
13390,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"not given Himself, so the highest and best offering we can bring to"
13391,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Him is our unselfish consecrated selves.” Celia remembered the thrill
13392,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"with which she had listened. Agatha’s voice was like music, and the"
13393,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"thoughts had seemed to fit her voice and make a poem of them, which had"

13395,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13396,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,That was a week ago. Why should the words come back to her this

13399,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"What had they to do with Hester, and the door-bells to answer, and the"

13413,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“So we are,” said Celia, answering them both in one; “but the girls can"
13414,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"get along well enough without me. There are eight of them, and Marion’s"
13415,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Aunt Laura is going to show them how to arrange everything; and as for
13416,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"staying to tea, why, I can do that another time; and the baby is sick,"
13417,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"and Hester is worried about him, I know. I should like to stay, mother,"
13418,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"truly, if you will let me.”"
13419,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13420,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Let you, child! I shall be thankful for your help. To tell the truth,"
13421,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"it seemed really selfish to keep Hester this afternoon, only I did not"
13422,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"know how to plan; I was sure cook could not get along without help,"
13423,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"though she was willing to try, because she felt sorry for Hester.”"
13424,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13425,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“May I tell Hester about it, mother?” Celia asked, her eyes shining;"
13426,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,“and she can carry my flowers and leave them at Marion’s.”
13427,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13428,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"The flowers and their owner went away together, followed by Mrs."
13429,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Foster. As for the young ladies, Agatha took pretty pink silk stitches"
13430,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"on the lovely white satin and said not a word, while Lorene, turning to"
13431,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"the piano, played a few bars, and sang softly:"
13432,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13433,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Low in the grave he lay,"
13434,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Jesus my Saviour,”"
13435,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13436,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"breaking off to say: “Celia is a strange little girl, isn’t she?”"
13437,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13438,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Very strange,” answered Agatha, and she finished a pink bud as she"
13439,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,spoke. She was making an Easter offering.
13440,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13441,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Nobody, it is safe to say, was more surprised at the turn of affairs"
13442,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,than was Hester. She thought about it while she hurriedly combed the
13443,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"tangle of hair before her bit of broken glass, and made ready for going"
13444,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"home. She was worried about the baby, but she divided her thoughts"
13445,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,with this strange offering from Celia. She knew all about the Easter
13446,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"flowers, and the plans for the afternoon, and the high tea together at"
13447,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Marion’s lovely home. Celia’s talk had been full of it for the past two
13448,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"days. “I’d just like to know what made her do it, anyhow,” was Hester’s"
13449,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"concluding question, offered aloud to the tin basin, in which she"
13450,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,energetically washed her hands when the hair was done.
13451,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13452,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Easter morning was beautiful with sunshine and the song of birds, when"
13453,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Celia, looking from her window, saw Hester tripping around to the back"
13454,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,door. She had been allowed to stay at home all night.
13455,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13456,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“O, Hester!” called Celia, “how is the baby?”"
13457,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13458,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Hester looked up with a glad smile. “He is better,” she said, “ever so"
13459,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"much better. Mother would have sent me word, only she expected me. He"
13460,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"laughed and crowed as soon as he saw me, and you can’t think what a"
13461,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"lovely time I had with him. Say, Celia, I want to know what made you do"
13462,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,it?”
13463,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13464,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Celia’s sensitive face flushed, and she hesitated. How was she to tell"
13465,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Hester why she did it? From the next room came the notes of Lorene’s
13466,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"voice, as clear as any bird’s, rising high and pure:"
13467,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13468,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Low in the grave he lay,"
13469,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Jesus my Saviour.”
13470,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13471,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“It was that,” she said simply."
13472,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13473,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,“What?” asked Hester; “I don’t know what you mean.”
13474,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13475,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“That that Lorene is singing. He ‘lay in the grave,’ you know, for us."
13476,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"That is why it is Easter. I wanted to do something for somebody, and I"
13477,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,hadn’t any big thing.”
13478,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13479,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“It was a big thing to me,” Hester said, and went inside the back door."
13480,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,Celia’s face was just a trifle shadowed. Despite every effort to put
13481,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"it away, the thought would come: “After all, I needn’t have given it"
13482,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"up. The baby is better, and her mother would have sent her word, and"
13483,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,another Saturday would have done just as well; and I missed all the
13484,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,beauty and the fun. I know how to arrange flowers.”
13485,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13486,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,The shadow staid just a little during the Sunday-school hour. The
13487,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,girls were eager over the delights of the day before—eager to know
13488,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,how she could possibly have staid away. The lovely cross made largely
13489,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"of her own flowers, and bearing on their green background in pure"
13490,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"white blossoms the words, “He is risen,” was the most beautiful floral"
13491,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"decoration in the church. “Aunt Laura made it,” Marion said. “You did"
13492,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,not deserve to have it arranged so beautifully; we thought you ought to
13493,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"have had interest enough to have come and seen it, anyhow. Why didn’t"
13494,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,you?”
13495,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13496,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Never mind now,” said Celia; “I cannot explain, only I thought I could"
13497,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,not go.” Her offering seemed to her small and uncalled-for; she could
13498,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"not talk about it. Yet, before the morning prayer in church was over,"
13499,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"the shadow had lifted. “I did it truly for Him,” said Celia softly, to"
13500,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"herself; “He knows I did, and whether it was of use or not, it is all"
13501,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"right.” And when Lorene sang, in a voice like an angel’s:"
13502,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13503,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"“Low in the grave he lay,"
13504,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"Jesus my Saviour,”"
13505,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13506,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,she could not help being glad that she did it.
13507,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,
13508,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"That evening, when they were coming out of the Christian Endeavor"
13509,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"meeting, the minister, who was shaking hands with the young people on"
13510,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"every side, held in his left hand a single calla lily of rare beauty."
13511,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,As he held out his hand to Celia he laid the lily against her cheek and
13512,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"said: “That is for you, little girl. A token from the Master, I think,"
13513,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,since he made it. Let me tell you something which will make it bloom
13514,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,for you forever. Hester came to me this evening to say that she wanted
13515,CELIA’S EASTER OFFERING.,"to belong to Jesus, and learn how to grow like him, just as you had.”"

13622,A MAY MORNING.,
13623,A MAY MORNING.,All around are green fields and hills and tall trees. Every day they

13633,A MAY MORNING.,
13634,A MAY MORNING.,And there are ever so many nice things for them to do. They fish in the

13750,THE HARD TEXT.,"outrageously, calling Him all sorts of bad names, and finally putting"
13751,THE HARD TEXT.,Him to death in the most cruel manner. But it does not seem quite right
13752,THE HARD TEXT.,for Him to call them vile names back again. It looks as though He lost
13753,THE HARD TEXT.,his temper and became awfully angry with his enemies.”
13754,THE HARD TEXT.,
13755,THE HARD TEXT.,Indeed it does say He once looked around upon them with anger. So you
13756,THE HARD TEXT.,"are right with that word, but its real meaning is indignation, the"
13757,THE HARD TEXT.,righteous feeling every one should have against wrong. Thus you ought
13758,THE HARD TEXT.,"to feel against swearing, stealing, the liquor business and all such"
13759,THE HARD TEXT.,things. It would be wicked for you to smile at such things. So much for
13760,THE HARD TEXT.,anger—the anger of Jesus. Now about “calling names.”
13761,THE HARD TEXT.,
13762,THE HARD TEXT.,You must remember Jesus knew the hearts of these Pharisee Jews—how
13763,THE HARD TEXT.,"black, how vile they were, while they thought themselves quite good and"
13764,THE HARD TEXT.,beautiful. Gentle talk to them did no good. To have them see themselves
13765,THE HARD TEXT.,"as they really were, he must be plain; he must speak out. What he did"
13766,THE HARD TEXT.,"was not “calling names” as one boy does to another, when he is “mad”"
13767,THE HARD TEXT.,"with him and hates him. Jesus did not hate them, bad as they were. He"
13768,THE HARD TEXT.,would save them if they would repent and come to him. So he must warn
13769,THE HARD TEXT.,them by telling them the awful truth.
13770,THE HARD TEXT.,
13771,THE HARD TEXT.,"So it was; Jesus could draw some by gentle, loving words and ways;"
13772,THE HARD TEXT.,"others, if saved at all, must be driven. Jesus acted according to the"
13773,THE HARD TEXT.,kind of people he was speaking to.
13774,THE HARD TEXT.,
13775,THE HARD TEXT.,May we sometimes deal this terrible way with sinners? May ministers do
13776,THE HARD TEXT.,it? Some years ago Rev. C. G. Finney did often speak to many who came
13777,THE HARD TEXT.,out to oppose him and make fun of religion—he did speak very plainly
13778,THE HARD TEXT.,and severely. It is said Mr. Moody once rebuked a wicked man this very
13779,THE HARD TEXT.,way. But not every one can wisely do it. It must be done with great
13780,THE HARD TEXT.,sorrow. No doubt it almost broke Jesus’ heart to say such plain things.
13781,THE HARD TEXT.,"A parent sometimes must punish a naughty child; it hurts him to do it,"
13782,THE HARD TEXT.,however. He often weeps more than the punished child.

13790,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,
13791,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,
13792,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"BY this time you are feeling that papa is being neglected, and that"
13793,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,mamma and sister are having all the gifts; though I believe papa would
13794,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,like the nice writing-case with pockets which we planned in November
13795,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"quite as well, perhaps, as any member of the family. However, I am sure"
13796,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"of one thing he will like, and it is something which you, my girl, can"
13797,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"make, with some industry and very little expense."
13798,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"I do hope you know how to knit, the nice old-fashioned knitting which"
13799,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"our dear grandmothers understood so well? If you do not, my first"
13800,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,advice to you is to master that fine art which has of late years gone
13801,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"so nearly out of fashion; it is coming to the front again, and there"
13802,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,is no end to the neat little comforts which you can make with the aid
13803,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,of a ball of tidy cotton and two large knitting needles. I will not
13804,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"attempt to teach you the stitch on paper, though if you sat by my side"
13805,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,I could show it to you with very little trouble. If there is not a dear
13806,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"white-haired grandmother in your home, as I hope there is, borrow one"
13807,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"of some friend, and beg her to teach you how to knit. Of course it is"
13808,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,just possible that mamma herself understands the stitch; you might try
13809,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,her.
13810,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,
13811,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,Having learned it—which I am sure you can do in an hour—get two
13812,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"large-size needles of steel, or ivory, or wood—I like to use wood—and"
13813,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"a ball of the very coarsest tidy cotton you can find, and set to work."
13814,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"Cast on as many stitches as the needle will conveniently carry, and"
13815,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"knit back and forth, back and forth industriously, until you have a"
13816,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,strip a yard long. Oh! it will require patience and industry; I told
13817,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"you that in the beginning, you know. Having finished the strip begin"
13818,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"again, and make another precisely like it; then a third, and perhaps,"
13819,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"if your needles are not very long, a fourth—you might consult with"
13820,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,mamma or Auntie as to that. When the four are finished—in order to be
13821,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,sure to have the article large enough we will say four—fold the side
13822,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"edges of two neatly together, and knit them together with a crochet"
13823,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"hook, or sew them with a needle and some of the tidy cotton, as you"
13824,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"will; add the third and fourth in the same manner, and when all is"
13825,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,complete if you do not have a bath towel which will please papa better
13826,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"than any Turkish towel he ever bought, I shall be astonished and"
13827,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"disappointed. For fear of discouraging you at the outset, I mentioned a"
13828,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"yard as the length, but let me whisper to you, entirely in confidence,"
13829,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"that if you should make it a yard and a half long, or even a trifle"
13830,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"longer, papa would like it better still. You see I have heard the"
13831,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"gentlemen groan over short bathing towels, and I know all about it."
13832,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,
13833,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"You see with how very little expense such an article could be made,"
13834,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,and I really do not know of any one thing which will add more to the
13835,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,comfort of the toilet. Some gentlemen like very coarse and rough
13836,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"bathing towels, in which case macremé cord is sometimes used instead of"
13837,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"tidy cotton; probably mamma could advise you wisely in this direction,"
13838,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,also.
13839,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,
13840,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"If you undertake such a gift, I hope you will have the kindness"
13841,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"to write and tell me how you succeeded, when and how the gift was"
13842,SOMETHING FOR PAPA.,"presented, what was said, and all about it."
