66,PREFACE,
67,PREFACE,"Several of the rhymed stories in this book are true stories, and"
68,PREFACE,"children may enjoy them the more for knowing that Barney, a real"
69,PREFACE,"donkey, did run away and play pranks as the rhymes say; that Midget did"
70,PREFACE,ride horseback; that the deer did toss the hay to the hungry pony; and
71,PREFACE,that Queen Victoria did restore the birds' nesting-place in the old
72,PREFACE,"round tower at Windsor. Pony Rollo, too, is a real character, clever"
73,PREFACE,"and lovable, although some liberties have been taken in the portrayal"
74,PREFACE,"of him and his doings. Barney Gray is still living, petted by his now"
75,PREFACE,grown-up owners and enjoyed by all children who visit the farm to which
76,PREFACE,"the donkey came about twenty years ago, and a drive with Barney is"
77,PREFACE,quite as likely now as in former days to have unexpected features.
78,PREFACE,
79,PREFACE,The pictures of Barney and some of the other pets have been drawn by
80,PREFACE,Mr. Bridgman from photographs taken expressly for this book.
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,In the belief that such rhymes as are herein offered gratify and
83,PREFACE,"increase in children both the love of animals and the sense of humor,"
84,PREFACE,"this new volume is sent forth not only to give pleasure, but to"
85,PREFACE,contribute what it may to the fostering of these desirable traits.
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,"Kindergartners will find here, as in _Through the Farmyard Gate_,"
88,PREFACE,"suitable material for kindergarten use; for example, the cumulative"
89,PREFACE,"rhyme, _The Pigeons_, and the tracing-back rhyme, _Who Gives us Our"
90,PREFACE,Thanksgiving Dinner?_
91,PREFACE,
92,PREFACE,For courteous permission to use such of these rhymes as have already
93,PREFACE,"appeared in print, acknowledgments are made to publishers and"
94,PREFACE,"periodicals as follows: The Century Company, New York (_St. Nicholas_);"
95,PREFACE,"S. E. Cassino, Salem, Massachusetts (_Little Folks_); and Milton"

159,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
160,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
161,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"A sturdy little donkey,"
162,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"All dressed in sober gray,"
163,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Once took it in his long-eared head
164,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,That he would run away.
165,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
166,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"So, when a little open"
167,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"He saw the stable door,"
168,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,He ran as if he never would
169,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Come back there any more.
170,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
171,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
172,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
173,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Away that donkey galloped
174,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And ran and ran and ran
175,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And ran and ran and ran and ran
176,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And RAN and RAN and =RAN=!
177,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
178,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
179,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
180,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"Behind him ran the children,"
181,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"The groom and coachman, too;"
182,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"The farmer and the farmer's man,"
183,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,To see what they could do.
184,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
185,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
186,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
187,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Some carried whips to whip him;
188,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"Some, oats to coax him near;"
189,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"Some called, ""Come here, you foolish beast!"""
190,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"And some, ""Come, Barney, dear."""
191,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
192,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,But not a whit cared Barney
193,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,For cross or coaxing word;
194,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"And clatter, clatter, clatter still,"
195,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,His little hoofs were heard.
196,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
197,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"And all across the meadow,"
198,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"And up and o'er the hill,"
199,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And through the woods and down the dale
200,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,He galloped with a will.
201,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
202,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And into every hay field
203,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And through the swamp and mire
204,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Still Barney ran and ran and ran
205,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,As if he'd never tire!
206,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
207,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,His chasers all stopped running;
208,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Then meek as any lamb
209,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"Did Barney stand, as if to say,"
210,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"""Come catch me! Here I am."""
211,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
212,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
213,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
214,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"But when one of them started,"
215,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Then Barney started too;
216,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"As if the chase had just begun,"
217,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Away he swiftly flew.
218,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
219,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"But there's an end to all things,"
220,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"And so, the stupid elf,"
221,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,When no one else could capture him
222,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,This donkey caught himself.
223,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
224,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"For, running in the barnyard,"
225,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,He did not calculate
226,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"What consequences would befall,"
227,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And hit the swinging gate.
228,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
229,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
230,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
231,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,It quickly swung together;
232,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Down dropped the iron latch.
233,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"Oh, Barney Gray, to think that you"
234,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,The runaway should catch!
235,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
236,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
237,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
238,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"The children danced with pleasure,"
239,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"The groom roared with delight,"
240,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,The others smiled their broadest smiles
241,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Or laughed with all their might.
242,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
243,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"But Barney, naughty Barney,"
244,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Had mischief in him still;
245,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,For when the laughing coachman tried
246,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"To lead him up the hill,"
247,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
248,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,His donkeyship determined
249,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"That he would yet have fun,"
250,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,So braced himself and stood stock still
251,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,As if he weighed a ton!
252,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
253,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,But mighty was the coachman
254,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And pulled with such a will
255,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,That Barney soon was being dragged
256,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Full roughly up the hill.
257,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
258,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,[Illustration]
259,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
260,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"""Well, well!"" at last thought Barney,"
261,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"""The coachman is so strong,"
262,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,"I might as well be good just now,"""
263,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And so he walked along.
264,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
265,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And when he reached the stable
266,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,And stood within his stall
267,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,You'd scarce believe so meek a beast
268,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,_Could_ run away at all!
269,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,
270,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,But all the meditations
271,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Of this meek Barney Gray
272,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,Are only of some future time
273,THE RUNAWAY DONKEY,When he may run away.

1466,OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK,
1467,OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK,For speedily they hitched him

1486,OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK,
1487,OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK,"Well, following was pleasant,"
