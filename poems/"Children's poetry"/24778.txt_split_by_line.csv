104,RED RIDING-HOOD.,Once upon a time there lived on the borders of a great forest a woodman
105,RED RIDING-HOOD.,"and his wife who had one little daughter, a sweet, kind child, whom"
106,RED RIDING-HOOD.,"every one loved. She was the joy of her mother's heart, and to please"
107,RED RIDING-HOOD.,"her, the good woman made her a little scarlet cloak and hood, and the"
108,RED RIDING-HOOD.,child looked so pretty in it that everybody called her Little Red

114,RED RIDING-HOOD.,One day her mother told her she meant to send her to her grandmother--a
115,RED RIDING-HOOD.,very old woman who lived in the heart of the wood--to take her some
116,RED RIDING-HOOD.,fresh butter and new-laid eggs and a nice cake. Little Red Riding-Hood
117,RED RIDING-HOOD.,"was very pleased to be sent on this errand, for she liked to do kind"
118,RED RIDING-HOOD.,"things, and it was so very long since she had seen her grandmother"
119,RED RIDING-HOOD.,that she had almost forgotten what the dame looked like.

126,_THE WOLF._,"The sun was shining brightly, but it was not too warm under the shade of"

128,_THE WOLF._,great bunch of wild flowers to give to her grandmother. She sang so
129,_THE WOLF._,"sweetly that a cushat dove flew down from a tree and followed her. Now,"
130,_THE WOLF._,"it happened that a wolf, a very cruel, greedy creature, heard her song"
131,_THE WOLF._,"also, and longed to eat her for his breakfast, but he knew Hugh, the"
132,_THE WOLF._,"woodman, was at work very near, with his great dog, and he feared they"
133,_THE WOLF._,"might hear Red Riding-Hood cry out, if he frightened her, and then they"
134,_THE WOLF._,"would kill him. So he came up to her very gently and said, ""Good day,"
135,_THE WOLF._,"Little Red Riding-Hood; where are you going?"""
136,_THE WOLF._,
137,_THE WOLF._,"""To see my grandmother,"" said the child, ""and take her a present from"

140,_THE WOLF._,"""Where does your grandmamma live?"" asked the wolf."
141,_THE WOLF._,
142,_THE WOLF._,"""Quite in the middle of the wood,"" she replied."
143,_THE WOLF._,
144,_THE WOLF._,"""Oh! I think I know the house. Good day, Red Riding-Hood."" And the wolf"

160,_AT PLAY IN THE WOOD._,"buzzing near her, and she would stop to watch it gathering honey from"

173,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,"While Little Red Riding-Hood was at play in the wood, the great wolf"

175,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,"lived all by herself, but once or twice a-day a neighbour's child came"
176,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,"to tidy her house and get her food. Now, grandmother was very feeble,"
177,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,and often kept her bed; and it happened that she was in bed the day
178,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,Little Red Riding-Hood went to see her. When the wolf reached the
179,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,cottage door he tapped.
180,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,
181,_GRANDMOTHER AND THE WOLF._,"""Who is there?"" asked the old dame."

198,_RED RIDING-HOOD AT THE DOOR._,thought he would like to eat sweet Red Riding-Hood also. Therefore he
199,_RED RIDING-HOOD AT THE DOOR._,"dressed himself in granny's nightcap and got into bed, and waited for"
200,_RED RIDING-HOOD AT THE DOOR._,the child to knock at the door. But he waited a long time.

248,_THE WOLF AND THE CHILD._,just at that minute the door flew open and a great dog tore him down.

262,_DEATH OF THE WOLF._,
263,_DEATH OF THE WOLF._,"""Well,"" said Hugh, ""when you were gone by, I remembered that a wolf had"

265,_DEATH OF THE WOLF._,you and see if you were safe. When we came near grandmother's house Trim
266,_DEATH OF THE WOLF._,"sniffed and ran to the door and whined, and then he pushed it open--you"

279,PUSS IN BOOTS.,Once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons. When he died he
280,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"left his mill to the eldest son, his ass to the second son, and his cat"
281,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"to the youngest, who had always been his favourite."
282,PUSS IN BOOTS.,
283,PUSS IN BOOTS.,The two eldest sons resolved to live together; but they would not let
284,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"their brother live with them, because he had only a cat. So the poor lad"
285,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"was very sorrowful, and wondered what he should do to get his bread."
286,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"While he was sitting thinking about it, Puss jumped up on the table, and"

296,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"The miller's son had very little money, but he thought it such a"

298,PUSS IN BOOTS.,"So he took Puss to the shoemaker's, and got him to make her a very smart"

304,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"Now, not far from the mill there was a rabbit warren, and Puss resolved"

306,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"fine parsley into her bag, went into the warren, and held the bag very"
307,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"quietly open, hiding herself behind it. And little greedy rabbits, who"
308,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"knew no better, ran into it, to have a feast. Directly they were safe"
309,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"in, Puss pulled the string of the bag, and carried them off to her"
310,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"master. The miller's son killed them, and cooked one for dinner; but"
311,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"Puss took away the other, which was a very fine one, and hung it up for"

313,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,
314,_THE RABBIT WARREN._,"But although their larder was thus provided, early the next day Puss"

360,_THE OGRE._,out of the way. Then he changed back into an ogre again. Puss praised
361,_THE OGRE._,"him a great deal, and then said, ""Can your ogreship become a small"

363,_THE OGRE._,
364,_THE OGRE._,"""Oh, yes,"" said the vain ogre; and he changed himself into a little"

634,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: JACK SELLS A COW FOR SOME BEANS.]
635,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
636,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack was a giddy, thoughtless boy, but very kind-hearted and"
637,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"affectionate. There had been a hard winter, and after it the poor woman"
638,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"had suffered from fever and ague. Jack did no work as yet, and by"
639,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,degrees they grew dreadfully poor. The widow saw that there was no means
640,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,of keeping Jack and herself from starvation but by selling her cow; so
641,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"one morning she said to her son, ""I am too weak to go myself, Jack, so"
642,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"you must take the cow to market for me, and sell her."" Jack liked going"
643,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"to market to sell the cow very much; but as he was on the way, he met a"
644,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,butcher who had some beautiful beans in his hand. Jack stopped to look
645,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"at them, and the butcher told the boy that they were of great value, and"
646,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,persuaded him to sell the cow for them! And Jack was so silly as to
647,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,consent to this foolish bargain.
648,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
649,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: THE BEAN-STALK GROWS OUT OF SIGHT IN A NIGHT.]
650,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
651,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,When he brought them home to his mother instead of the money she
652,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"expected for her nice cow, she was very vexed and shed many tears,"
653,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"scolding Jack for his folly. He was very sorry; but, he said, he might"
654,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"as well make the best of his bargain, so he put the seed-beans into the"
655,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,ground close by the side of the steep hill under shelter of which their
656,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"cottage was built, and went to bed. The next morning when he got up, he"
657,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"found that the beans had grown, till the bean stalks reached right over"
658,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"the top of the hill, and were lost to his sight. Greatly surprised, he"
659,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"called his mother, and they both gazed in silent wonder at the"
660,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"bean-stalk, which was not only of great height, but was thick enough to"
661,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,bear Jack's weight.
662,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
663,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""I wonder where it goes?"" said Jack to his mother; ""I think I will climb"

665,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
666,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"His mother wished him not to venture up this strange ladder, but Jack"
667,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"coaxed her to give her consent to the attempt, for he was certain there"
668,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,must be something wonderful in the bean-stalk.
669,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
670,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack instantly began to climb, and went up and up on the ladder-like"
671,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"bean till every thing he had left behind him, the cottage, the village,"
672,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"and even the tall church tower, looked quite little, and still he did"
673,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,not see the top of the bean stalk.
674,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
675,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack felt a little tired, and thought for a moment that he would go back"
676,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"again; but he was a very persevering boy, and he knew that the way to"
677,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,succeed in anything is not to give up. So after resting for a moment he
678,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"went on, and at last reached the top of the bean, and found himself in a"
679,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"beautiful country, finely wooded; and not far from the place where he"
680,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,had got off the bean-stalk stood a fine and strong castle.
681,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
682,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,Jack wondered very much that he had never heard of or seen this castle
683,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"before; but when he reflected on the subject, he saw that it was as much"
684,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,separated from the village by the perpendicular rock on which it stood
685,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,as if it were in another land.
686,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
687,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"While Jack was standing looking at the castle, a very strange-looking"

694,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"father, and took it from your mother; try and win it back from the"
695,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"monster who now has it."" As she ceased speaking she suddenly"
696,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"disappeared, and of course Jack knew she was a fairy."
697,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
698,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: JACK ASKS ABOUT THE CASTLE.]
699,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
700,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"He was much surprised; however, he walked up to the castle door and"
701,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"knocked, and an old giantess came out. She did not wait till he spoke,"
702,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"but pulled him in at once, for she thought he would make a nice supper"
703,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"for her when her husband was asleep. Just at that moment, however, she"
704,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"heard the giant's step approaching, so she put Jack into a press, and"
705,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"told him to hide there, or the giant would eat him. As soon as the Ogre"
706,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"came in, he cried in a terrible voice"
707,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
708,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Fee, fa, fie, fo, fum,"
709,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"I smell the breath of an Englishman."""
710,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
711,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Oh!"" said his wife, ""there is nobody here. You only smell a crow that"
712,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"is flying over the chimney."" Then the giant sat down to dinner, which"
713,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"was quite ready, and when he had eaten a whole sheep, he said, ""Bring me"
714,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"my hen."""
715,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
716,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The giantess brought a hen, and put it on the table before him, and then"
717,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"she went away. ""Lay,"" said the giant to the hen, and she laid a golden"
718,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,egg. Jack could see quite plainly through a little hole which he had
719,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"bored in the door. Three times the giant said ""Lay,"" and each time the"
720,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"hen laid a solid gold egg. Then the Ogre, being drowsy, shut his eyes,"
721,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,and soon snored very loudly. Directly Jack found that the giant was
722,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"asleep, he stole out of the press, caught up the hen, ran out of the"
723,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"room, opened the door of the castle, which the giant had left ajar, and"
724,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,descended the bean-stalk as fast as he could go. His mother was glad to
725,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"see him again, and much surprised at seeing the hen, which laid them"
726,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,three gold eggs every day. Jack's mother took them to the next town and
727,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"sold them, and soon grew quite rich. Some time afterwards Jack made"
728,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,another journey up the bean-stalk to the giant's castle; but first he
729,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,dyed his hair and disguised himself. The old woman did not know him
730,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"again, and dragged him in as she had done before to eat him by-and-by;"
731,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"but once more she heard her husband coming and hid him in the press, not"
732,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,thinking that it was the same boy who had stolen the hen. She put him
733,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"into the same press, and bade him stay quite still there, or the giant"
734,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,would eat him.

746,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: JACK TAKES THE GIANT'S MONEY-BAGS.]
747,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
748,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Then the giant sat down, and when he had eaten half an ox, he told his"
749,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,wife to bring his money-bags to him. She instantly went and fetched two
750,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,large bags full of gold; and then left him to go about her usual
751,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,house-work.
752,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
753,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The Ogre counted out the gold twice over, and then put it into the bags"
754,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,and tied them up. In a few minutes Jack heard him snore. He directly
755,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"crept out of the press, seized the bags, and hurrying out of the castle,"
756,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,carried them home quite safely. Jack's mother was glad to see him safe
757,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"at home again, and for a long time she would not let him go up the"
758,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,bean-stalk; but Jack knew he had not yet obeyed the fairy's command to
759,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"win back the castle, so after a time he set off once more on this"

762,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The giantess, who was very stupid, did not know him again, but she"
763,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,stopped a minute before she took him in. She feared another robbery; but
764,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack's fresh cheeks looked so tempting that she could not resist him,"
765,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,and so she bade him come in.
766,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
767,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,But at that moment she heard her husband's step approaching.
768,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
769,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Afraid of losing her supper, the Ogress at once shut Jack in the press;"
770,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"and she had hardly hidden him when the giant came in, saying as usual,"
771,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
772,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Fee, fa, fie, fo, fum,"
773,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"I smell the blood of an Englishman."""
774,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
775,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Oh no!"" said his wife, ""it is only the shepherd, who has been up with a"

777,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
778,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The giant sat down, and when he had eaten a whole sheep he said, ""I"
779,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"should like some music; bring me my harp."""
780,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
781,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The Ogress went and brought a golden harp to him, set it on the table,"
782,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"and went away. Then the Ogre said, ""Play,"" to the harp, and it played so"
783,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,delightfully that Jack was charmed.
784,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
785,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: JACK TAKES THE TALKING HARP.]
786,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
787,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"By-and-by, however, the giant snored so loud that he could not hear the"
788,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"music; and Jack quickly stole out, and seizing the harp, ran away with"
789,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"it. But the harp was a fairy belonging to the giant, and as Jack ran, it"
790,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"cried out, ""Master! Master!"" The giant woke up slowly and rushed after"
791,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack, but the boy was very nimble and outran him. You may imagine how"
792,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"fast Jack went down the bean-stalk this time, hearing all the while"
793,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,the tramp of the giant's feet behind him.
794,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
795,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,[Illustration: THE GIANT BREAKS HIS NECK.]
796,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
797,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,Just as he reached the bottom he saw the Ogre looking down on him.

799,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,The next moment his great feet were on the bean-stalk.
800,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
801,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Mother, mother! bring me the axe,"" cried Jack."
802,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
803,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"His mother hastened with it, and just as the giant was half way down the"
804,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"bean-stalk, Jack succeeded in chopping it in halves; the lower half"
805,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"fell; the upper half swung away, and the giant, losing his hold, fell"
806,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,heavily to the ground on his head and broke his neck.
807,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
808,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"The same moment the fairy again stood beside Jack, and touching the"
809,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"broken bean-stalk was turned into a flight of broad, easy steps."
810,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
811,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"""Go up,"" she said, ""and take possession of your own home, so long kept"
812,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"from you. The Ogress is dead, and there is no more danger. You have been"
813,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"brave and good. May you be happy."""
814,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,
815,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"Jack thanked the fairy very warmly for her aid, and she again departed"
816,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,"to Fairyland, after explaining to Jack that she had been the butcher who"
817,JACK & THE BEAN-STALK.,sold him the beans.

823,TOM THUMB.,
824,TOM THUMB.,
825,TOM THUMB.,In the days of good king Arthur there lived a countryman and his wife
826,TOM THUMB.,"who, though they had plenty to eat and to drink, and a very comfortable"
827,TOM THUMB.,"cottage to live in, were not at all happy."
828,TOM THUMB.,
829,TOM THUMB.,"They had no children, and they both wished very much for a baby. The"
830,TOM THUMB.,wife was often in tears when her husband was out at work and she was all
831,TOM THUMB.,"alone, because she had not an infant to take care of and nurse. One day,"
832,TOM THUMB.,"as she sat weeping by herself, more than usually sad, she said aloud,"
833,TOM THUMB.,"""If I only had a dear little baby, I should not care what it was like. I"
834,TOM THUMB.,should be thankful for one if it were _no bigger than my husband's
835,TOM THUMB.,"thumb_."""
836,TOM THUMB.,
837,TOM THUMB.,"Now it happened that the Queen of the Fairies was passing by, though the"
838,TOM THUMB.,"poor woman could not see her, and as she knew the farmer's wife was kind"
839,TOM THUMB.,"to the poor and likely to be a good mother, she thought she would grant"
840,TOM THUMB.,her wish.
841,TOM THUMB.,
842,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: THE FARMER'S WIFE CRYING BECAUSE SHE HAS NO BABY.]
843,TOM THUMB.,
844,TOM THUMB.,So about an hour or two afterwards the woman was much surprised to see
845,TOM THUMB.,"standing by the table a very beautiful lady, dressed splendidly, with a"
846,TOM THUMB.,"glittering star on her forehead and a wand in her right hand, with a"
847,TOM THUMB.,gem of great brilliancy at the top of it. But what delighted the woman
848,TOM THUMB.,"most of all was a tiny cradle, made of a walnut shell, lined with"
849,TOM THUMB.,"velvet, in which lay the prettiest baby ever seen, but it was only just"
850,TOM THUMB.,"as large as a man's thumb. ""See,"" said the fairy, ""your wish is granted."
851,TOM THUMB.,"Here is a baby for you. Take care of it; it is your own."" The woman did"
852,TOM THUMB.,"not know how to thank the fairy enough; she was so delighted, and the"
853,TOM THUMB.,queen went away quite pleased at having given so much happiness.
854,TOM THUMB.,
855,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: THE FAIRY QUEEN BRINGING TOM THUMB TO HIS MOTHER.]
856,TOM THUMB.,
857,TOM THUMB.,"Before the fairy went away, however, she gave the woman a little shirt"
858,TOM THUMB.,of spider's web and a doublet of thistle-down for the baby.
859,TOM THUMB.,
860,TOM THUMB.,When the farmer came home he was very much pleased. He invited all his
861,TOM THUMB.,"friends to the christening, and the child was named ""Tom,"" after him,"
862,TOM THUMB.,"and ""Thumb,"" because he was no bigger than one."
863,TOM THUMB.,
864,TOM THUMB.,"The baby was very well, and merry, and grew, of course; but still it was"
865,TOM THUMB.,very small.
866,TOM THUMB.,
867,TOM THUMB.,"However, at last Tom thought himself quite a great boy, and begged his"
868,TOM THUMB.,"mother to make him a little suit of clothes, and she made him one; but"
869,TOM THUMB.,"with a great deal of trouble, they were so small."
870,TOM THUMB.,
871,TOM THUMB.,Tom was very often in mischief. He was so small that his mother used to
872,TOM THUMB.,put him on the table to play; and once she found him in the salt-box.
873,TOM THUMB.,
874,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: TOM FALLS INTO THE PUDDING.]
875,TOM THUMB.,
876,TOM THUMB.,"One day she was making a plum-pudding, and Tom stood by the side of the"
877,TOM THUMB.,"basin, and peeped over the edge; but he could not see into it very well,"
878,TOM THUMB.,"and while his mother was gone for some more flour, he drew himself up on"
879,TOM THUMB.,the edge of the basin. Alas! he fell in and disappeared in the wet
880,TOM THUMB.,"pudding, which for poor Tom was a huge morass."
881,TOM THUMB.,
882,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: THE FALL OF THE PUDDING.]
883,TOM THUMB.,
884,TOM THUMB.,"Tom would have cried out, but the pudding stuck his lips together, and"
885,TOM THUMB.,"his mother not missing him, stirred him up in the mixture, and put it"
886,TOM THUMB.,and him into the pot. Tom no sooner felt the hot water than he danced
887,TOM THUMB.,about like mad; the woman was nearly frightened out of her wits to see
888,TOM THUMB.,"the pudding come out of the pot and jump about, and she was glad to give"
889,TOM THUMB.,it to a tinker who was passing that way. The tinker took the pudding and
890,TOM THUMB.,"put it into a cloth, to carry it home to his family, who seldom tasted"
891,TOM THUMB.,such a good dish.
892,TOM THUMB.,
893,TOM THUMB.,"But by-and-by, as he was climbing over a stile, he happened to squeeze"
894,TOM THUMB.,"it, and Tom, who had made quite an arch over his own head in the dry"
895,TOM THUMB.,"pudding by this time, cried out from the middle of it, ""Hallo, Pickens!"""
896,TOM THUMB.,which so terrified the tinker that he let the pudding drop in the field
897,TOM THUMB.,and scampered off as fast as he could. The pudding fell to pieces in the
898,TOM THUMB.,"fall, and Tom, creeping out, went home to his mother, whom he found in"
899,TOM THUMB.,"great trouble, because she could not find him."
900,TOM THUMB.,
901,TOM THUMB.,"After this accident, Tom's mother never let him stay near her while she"
902,TOM THUMB.,"was cooking, but she was obliged to take him with her when she went out"
903,TOM THUMB.,"milking, for she dared not trust the little man in the house alone."
904,TOM THUMB.,
905,TOM THUMB.,"A few days after his escape from the pudding, Tom went, with his mother,"
906,TOM THUMB.,"into the fields to milk the cows, and for fear he should be blown away"
907,TOM THUMB.,"by the wind, she tied him to a thistle with a small piece of thread."
908,TOM THUMB.,
909,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: THE COW EATS TOM.]
910,TOM THUMB.,
911,TOM THUMB.,"Very soon after, a cow eat up the thistle and swallowed Tom Thumb. His"
912,TOM THUMB.,mother was in sad grief again; but Tom scratched and kicked in the cow's
913,TOM THUMB.,"throat till she was glad to throw him out of her mouth again, and he was"
914,TOM THUMB.,"not at all hurt; but his mother became very anxious about her small son,"
915,TOM THUMB.,who now gave her a great deal of trouble. Sometimes he fell into the
916,TOM THUMB.,milk-pail and was nearly drowned in the milk; once he was nearly killed
917,TOM THUMB.,"by an angry chicken, and another time had a narrow escape from a cat."
918,TOM THUMB.,
919,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: THE EAGLE FLIES AWAY WITH TOM.]
920,TOM THUMB.,
921,TOM THUMB.,"One day Tom went ploughing with his father, who gave him a whip made of"
922,TOM THUMB.,"a barley straw, to drive the oxen with; but an eagle, flying by, caught"
923,TOM THUMB.,"him up in his beak, and carried him to the top of a great giant's"
924,TOM THUMB.,"castle, and dropped him on the leads. The giant was walking on the"
925,TOM THUMB.,battlements and thought at first that it was a foreign bird which lay at
926,TOM THUMB.,"his feet, but soon seeing that it was a small man, he picked Tom up with"
927,TOM THUMB.,"his finger and thumb, and put the poor little creature into his great"
928,TOM THUMB.,"mouth, but the fairy dwarf scratched the roof of the giant's mouth, and"
929,TOM THUMB.,"bit his great tongue, and held on by his teeth till the ogre, in a"
930,TOM THUMB.,"passion, took him out again and threw him over into the sea, which ran"
931,TOM THUMB.,beneath the castle walls. Here a very large fish swallowed him up
932,TOM THUMB.,directly.
933,TOM THUMB.,
934,TOM THUMB.,"Tom did not at all like swimming about in the fish, but by-and-by he"
935,TOM THUMB.,"felt it drawn upwards, and guessed at once that it was caught. And so it"
936,TOM THUMB.,"was; and being a very large fish, the fisherman thought it would make a"
937,TOM THUMB.,good present for his beloved King Arthur. So he took it to the palace
938,TOM THUMB.,and begged the king to accept it.
939,TOM THUMB.,
940,TOM THUMB.,"King Arthur was pleased with the poor man's affection, and ordered the"
941,TOM THUMB.,fish to be carried to the kitchen and cooked for his own dinner. The
942,TOM THUMB.,"fisherman took it to the cook, who admired it very much, but said it was"
943,TOM THUMB.,very heavy. Then he laid it on a table and began to cut it open. You may
944,TOM THUMB.,imagine how he jumped with fear and wonder when Tom Thumb slipped out of
945,TOM THUMB.,the fish!
946,TOM THUMB.,
947,TOM THUMB.,"The cook's cries brought the other servants, and soon everybody near ran"
948,TOM THUMB.,to behold this wonder--the tiny man who came out of the fish.
949,TOM THUMB.,
950,TOM THUMB.,"Tom begged for some water to wash himself, and when he was clean, the"
951,TOM THUMB.,courtiers thought him so pretty and such a marvel that they ran to tell
952,TOM THUMB.,the king about him.
953,TOM THUMB.,
954,TOM THUMB.,[Illustration: TOM COMES OUT OF THE FISH.]
955,TOM THUMB.,
956,TOM THUMB.,Arthur was very much surprised; but he desired them to send the little
957,TOM THUMB.,"man up after dinner to see him, and the Court tailor made haste at once"
958,TOM THUMB.,"to get ready a Court suit for Tom, which did not take him long to"
959,TOM THUMB.,make; there were so few stitches in it!

963,TOM THUMB.,"As soon as the king's great punch-bowl was set on the royal table, Tom"
964,TOM THUMB.,"Thumb was carried to see the monarch, who was delighted with the little"
965,TOM THUMB.,"man. Tom walked on the King's hand, and danced on the Queen's. He became"
966,TOM THUMB.,"a great favourite with Arthur, who made him a knight. Such is the"
967,TOM THUMB.,"wonderful history of Tom Thumb, who did much good when he grew older,"
968,TOM THUMB.,"and thus proved that however small people are, they may be of use in the"
969,TOM THUMB.,"world. He was good and kind to his parents, and to everybody; and the"

986,CINDERELLA.,"mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella's sisters did not love her,"
987,CINDERELLA.,and were very unkind to her. As she grew older they made her work as a
988,CINDERELLA.,"servant, and even sift the cinders; on which account they used to call"

1108,CINDERELLA.,"precious glass slippers! She did not stop to pick it up, but rushed to"
1109,CINDERELLA.,"the door. Alas! the clock had struck ELEVEN. She found no coach, only a"
1110,CINDERELLA.,"pumpkin, and the rat and mice ran quickly away when they saw her; while"
1111,CINDERELLA.,"all her fine dress turned to rags, and she had to run home alone in the"
1112,CINDERELLA.,darkness of the night.
1113,CINDERELLA.,
1114,CINDERELLA.,"The Prince was very much surprised when he missed Cinderella again, and"
1115,CINDERELLA.,"leaving the ball, went in search of her. He asked all the attendants,"
1116,CINDERELLA.,"but no one had seen her, and when enquiry was made of the porter, he"
1117,CINDERELLA.,said that no one had gone out of the palace except a poor ragged
1118,CINDERELLA.,beggar-girl.
1119,CINDERELLA.,
1120,CINDERELLA.,"However, the Prince's search was rewarded by his finding the glass"
1121,CINDERELLA.,"slipper, which he well knew belonged to the unknown Princess. He loved"
1122,CINDERELLA.,Cinderella so much that he now resolved to marry her; and as he felt
1123,CINDERELLA.,"sure that no one else could wear such a tiny shoe as hers was, he sent"
1124,CINDERELLA.,out a herald to proclaim that whichever lady in his kingdom could put on
1125,CINDERELLA.,this glass slipper should be his wife.
1126,CINDERELLA.,
1127,CINDERELLA.,"All the great ladies who wished to be a Princess tried to put it on, but"
1128,CINDERELLA.,"in vain. Cinderella's sisters tried, but could not get it on, and then"
1129,CINDERELLA.,"Cinderella asked if she might try. They laughed at her; but the Prince,"
1130,CINDERELLA.,"hearing of her wish, sent for her. She went with her sisters in her poor"
1131,CINDERELLA.,"dress, but very clean, and at once put on the slipper. Then she drew the"
1132,CINDERELLA.,"fellow of it from her pocket, and slipped it on her other foot."
1133,CINDERELLA.,
1134,CINDERELLA.,"The Prince, who had thought the moment he saw her that the poor girl was"
1135,CINDERELLA.,"very much like the beautiful Princess, was delighted. He insisted on"
1136,CINDERELLA.,"Cinderella telling him her story, which she did very modestly, and all"
1137,CINDERELLA.,listened with wonder.
1138,CINDERELLA.,
1139,CINDERELLA.,[Illustration: CINDERELLA TRIES ON THE SLIPPER.]
1140,CINDERELLA.,
1141,CINDERELLA.,"As her tale ended, the Fairy godmother suddenly entered the room, and"
1142,CINDERELLA.,"placing her godchild's hand in the Prince's, said:"
1143,CINDERELLA.,
1144,CINDERELLA.,"""Take this young girl for your wife, Prince; she is good and patient,"
1145,CINDERELLA.,"and as she has known how to submit to injustice meekly, she will know"
1146,CINDERELLA.,"how to reign justly."""
1147,CINDERELLA.,
1148,CINDERELLA.,[Illustration: CINDERELLA MARRIED TO THE PRINCE.]
1149,CINDERELLA.,
1150,CINDERELLA.,"So Cinderella was married to the Prince in great state, and they lived"
1151,CINDERELLA.,"together very happily. She forgave her sisters, and treated them always"
1152,CINDERELLA.,"very kindly, and the Prince had great cause to be glad that he had found"
1153,CINDERELLA.,the glass slipper.

1158,THE THREE BEARS.,THE THREE BEARS.
1159,THE THREE BEARS.,
1160,THE THREE BEARS.,
1161,THE THREE BEARS.,Once upon a time three bears lived in a nice little house in a great
1162,THE THREE BEARS.,forest.
1163,THE THREE BEARS.,
1164,THE THREE BEARS.,"There was the Father Bear, the Mother Bear, and the Baby Bear."
1165,THE THREE BEARS.,
1166,THE THREE BEARS.,"They had each a bed to sleep in, a chair to sit on, and a basin and"
1167,THE THREE BEARS.,"spoon for eating milk or honey, which was their favourite food."
1168,THE THREE BEARS.,
1169,THE THREE BEARS.,One morning the three bears resolved on taking a walk before breakfast;
1170,THE THREE BEARS.,"but before they went out, they poured their warm milk into their basins,"
1171,THE THREE BEARS.,that it might get cool by the time they came back.
1172,THE THREE BEARS.,
1173,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: THE BEARS AT BREAKFAST.]
1174,THE THREE BEARS.,
1175,THE THREE BEARS.,"When the milk was poured out, the three bears set out for a walk."
1176,THE THREE BEARS.,
1177,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: THE BEARS OUT FOR A WALK.]
1178,THE THREE BEARS.,
1179,THE THREE BEARS.,"Mr. and Mrs. Bear walked arm-in-arm, and Baby ran by their side."
1180,THE THREE BEARS.,
1181,THE THREE BEARS.,"""WHAT A FINE DAY IT IS!"" growled Mr. Bear."
1182,THE THREE BEARS.,
1183,THE THREE BEARS.,"""WHAT A FINE DAY IT IS!"" said Mrs. Bear."
1184,THE THREE BEARS.,
1185,THE THREE BEARS.,"""What a fine day!"" squeaked little Bear."
1186,THE THREE BEARS.,
1187,THE THREE BEARS.,And so it was.
1188,THE THREE BEARS.,
1189,THE THREE BEARS.,"The sun shone brightly though it was low in the sky, and its rays"
1190,THE THREE BEARS.,glittered on the fine webs on the grass. The leaves shivered in the soft
1191,THE THREE BEARS.,breeze; the wood-pigeon cooed; the lark sang loud enough to make himself
1192,THE THREE BEARS.,"hoarse; the sparrows chirped; the bee buzzed, and a yellow butterfly"
1193,THE THREE BEARS.,perched on great Bear's nose.
1194,THE THREE BEARS.,
1195,THE THREE BEARS.,"""What a squeaky noise these creatures make!"" said big Bear, as he"
1196,THE THREE BEARS.,"brushed off the butterfly. ""What a pity it is they have not _our_ deep"
1197,THE THREE BEARS.,"voices."""
1198,THE THREE BEARS.,
1199,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Yes,"" said Mrs. Bear; ""you have a much finer voice than the lark. I"
1200,THE THREE BEARS.,"should like to hear him growl as you do."""
1201,THE THREE BEARS.,
1202,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Oh, my dear, you are too kind; my growl is nothing to the lion's."""
1203,THE THREE BEARS.,
1204,THE THREE BEARS.,"And thus conversing, the bears walked on."
1205,THE THREE BEARS.,
1206,THE THREE BEARS.,"Now there lived in the same forest a sweet little girl, who was called"
1207,THE THREE BEARS.,"Golden Hair. She was the Woodman's daughter, and her hair looked just"
1208,THE THREE BEARS.,"like sunbeams. She knew every tree in the greenwood, and every flower in"
1209,THE THREE BEARS.,"it. She loved the birds, and liked to listen to their song; and"
1210,THE THREE BEARS.,everything in the wood loved Golden Hair. The trees bent down their
1211,THE THREE BEARS.,lower branches to touch her glittering head as she passed; the birds
1212,THE THREE BEARS.,sang sweeter as she glided by. The lark's song in the sky was--
1213,THE THREE BEARS.,
1214,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Come up, come up, Golden Hair; here is your happy home."""
1215,THE THREE BEARS.,
1216,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Coo, I love you; coo, I love you!"" cooed the wood-pigeon, as she"
1217,THE THREE BEARS.,passed.
1218,THE THREE BEARS.,
1219,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Twit, twit, pretty child,"" said the sparrow."
1220,THE THREE BEARS.,
1221,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Oh, you darling,"" sang the blackbird; and Golden Hair laughed with"
1222,THE THREE BEARS.,"glee, for she liked to be loved."
1223,THE THREE BEARS.,
1224,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: LITTLE GOLDEN HAIR.]
1225,THE THREE BEARS.,
1226,THE THREE BEARS.,"As to the butterflies, they flew after her, and rested on her hair, and"
1227,THE THREE BEARS.,tickled her cheeks; but she never tried to catch them.
1228,THE THREE BEARS.,
1229,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: GOLDEN HAIR PEEPING INTO THE BEARS' HOUSE.] She would
1230,THE THREE BEARS.,"not frighten or vex them for anything. She loved all the creatures, and"
1231,THE THREE BEARS.,that is why they loved her.
1232,THE THREE BEARS.,
1233,THE THREE BEARS.,Love makes love.
1234,THE THREE BEARS.,
1235,THE THREE BEARS.,"Dear little Golden Hair, she went on singing merrily through the"
1236,THE THREE BEARS.,"greenwood, saying sometimes to herself--"
1237,THE THREE BEARS.,
1238,THE THREE BEARS.,"""I wish I could sing as well as the lark!"""
1239,THE THREE BEARS.,
1240,THE THREE BEARS.,By-and-by Little Golden Hair reached the Bears' house. She had never
1241,THE THREE BEARS.,"seen it before, and she wondered who lived there. A window was open, and"
1242,THE THREE BEARS.,Golden Hair peeped in.
1243,THE THREE BEARS.,
1244,THE THREE BEARS.,"""Dear me,"" thought the child, ""whose house can it be! There is a table"
1245,THE THREE BEARS.,"and three chairs, and three basins of hot milk, all steaming, and nobody"
1246,THE THREE BEARS.,"to drink it. But I don't see any work or books, or anything else. I"
1247,THE THREE BEARS.,"think I will go in and see who lives here."""
1248,THE THREE BEARS.,
1249,THE THREE BEARS.,"So she tapped at the door, and cried, ""Is any one at home?"""
1250,THE THREE BEARS.,
1251,THE THREE BEARS.,"But there was no answer. Then Golden Hair stepped in very carefully,"
1252,THE THREE BEARS.,and looked about her.
1253,THE THREE BEARS.,
1254,THE THREE BEARS.,"She could not see any one, nor hear anybody snoring, so she walked into"
1255,THE THREE BEARS.,the Bears' parlour.
1256,THE THREE BEARS.,
1257,THE THREE BEARS.,"There was a fire, which made the room cheerful, and the hot milk looked"
1258,THE THREE BEARS.,"very inviting; it quite seemed to say, ""Come and have some breakfast;"""
1259,THE THREE BEARS.,"and the early spring air had made Golden Hair rather cold, and very"
1260,THE THREE BEARS.,hungry; so she sat down by the fire in the little Bear's chair. It was
1261,THE THREE BEARS.,"too small for her, but she did not quite sit down at first. In a moment"
1262,THE THREE BEARS.,"she got up again, and went round the table and tasted the milk in all"
1263,THE THREE BEARS.,"the basins. Little Bear's was the nicest, because it had sugar in it,"
1264,THE THREE BEARS.,and Golden Hair thought it was good. So she took the basin and sat down
1265,THE THREE BEARS.,"again in Little Bear's chair, took his spoon, and ate up _all_ his milk."
1266,THE THREE BEARS.,"Now this was very wrong. A tiny bear is only a tiny bear; still, he has"
1267,THE THREE BEARS.,a right to keep his own things. But Golden Hair did not know any better.
1268,THE THREE BEARS.,"Unluckily, Baby Bear's chair was, as we have said, too small for her;"
1269,THE THREE BEARS.,"she broke the seat and fell through, basin and all."
1270,THE THREE BEARS.,
1271,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: GOLDEN HAIR EATS THE LITTLE BEAR'S BREAKFAST.]
1272,THE THREE BEARS.,
1273,THE THREE BEARS.,"Then Golden Hair went upstairs, and there she saw three beds all in a"
1274,THE THREE BEARS.,"row. Golden Hair lay down on Father Bear's bed first, but that was too"
1275,THE THREE BEARS.,"long for her; then she lay down on Mother Bear's bed, and that was too"
1276,THE THREE BEARS.,"wide for her; last of all she lay down on Baby Bear's bed, and there she"
1277,THE THREE BEARS.,"fell asleep, for she was tired."
1278,THE THREE BEARS.,
1279,THE THREE BEARS.,[Illustration: THE LITTLE BEAR GRIEVES FOR HIS BROKEN CHAIR.]
1280,THE THREE BEARS.,
1281,THE THREE BEARS.,By-and-by the bears came home. Baby Bear saw that his chair was broken
1282,THE THREE BEARS.,"and thrown down, and he cried in a very squeaky voice,"
1283,THE THREE BEARS.,
1284,THE THREE BEARS.,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE;"" and Father Bear growled,"
1285,THE THREE BEARS.,
1286,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE;""","""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE;"""
1287,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE;""",
1288,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE;""","And Mother Bear growled, more softly,"

1292,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""","Then they went to the table and looked at their breakfasts, and Father"

1298,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""",
1299,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""","And then Tiny Bear began to cry, for he was very fond of his own basin"
1300,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""","and his own chair; and, besides, he was very hungry after his long walk"
1301,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""",in the forest.
1302,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""",
1303,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""",It really did seem a shame. Then the three bears thought they would go

1306,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""",
1307,"""SOMEBODY HAS BEEN HERE.""","They went upstairs to their bedroom, which was over their other room,"

1484,_THE SHEEP._,"The sheep is a very useful animal. Its wool, sheared off, makes us cloth"
1485,_THE SHEEP._,"and flannel, and all kinds of woollen goods; and its flesh, called"
1486,_THE SHEEP._,"mutton, is a chief part of our food. When sheep are little they are"

1491,_THE SHEEP._,"Sheep soon learn to know the voice of their shepherd, and will follow"
1492,_THE SHEEP._,"it. In Eastern countries the shepherd walks before his flock, and they"
1493,_THE SHEEP._,"are led by his voice. There are dogs called sheep-dogs, which take care"
1494,_THE SHEEP._,"of the flocks, and protect the sheep, and keep them together. In some"
1495,_THE SHEEP._,"countries these dogs have often to fight with wolves, which attack the"
1496,_THE SHEEP._,sheep and carry them off whenever they can; but the dogs are quite able
1497,_THE SHEEP._,to keep the wolf away when they are trained to do so.

1515,_RABBITS._,
1516,_RABBITS._,"There are a great many different kinds of tame rabbits; some are white,"
