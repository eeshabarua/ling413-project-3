34,PREFACE.,
35,PREFACE.,From the encouragement extended to our worthy publisher on the
36,PREFACE.,"presentation of the first and second volumes of the Annual, we conclude"
37,PREFACE.,"that the experiment of 1845 may be regarded as a successful one, and the"
38,PREFACE.,preparation of a little work of this kind an acceptable offering to the
39,PREFACE.,young.
40,PREFACE.,
41,PREFACE.,"The present year, our kind contributors have afforded us a much more"
42,PREFACE.,ample supply of interesting articles than could possibly appear. We
43,PREFACE.,regret that any who have so generously labored for us and our young
44,PREFACE.,"friends, should be denied the pleasure of greeting their articles on the"
45,PREFACE.,pages of the Annual. Let them not suspect that it is from any
46,PREFACE.,"disapproval or rejection of their labors. Be assured, dear friends, we"
47,PREFACE.,are more grateful than can properly be expressed in a brief preface. Our
48,PREFACE.,"warmest thanks are due our old friends, who, in the midst of other"
49,PREFACE.,"arduous duties, have willingly given us assistance. Let our new"
50,PREFACE.,"correspondents be assured they are gratefully remembered, although we"
51,PREFACE.,have not the pleasure or opportunity to present their articles to our
52,PREFACE.,readers in the present volume. They are at the publisher's disposal for
53,PREFACE.,another year.
54,PREFACE.,
55,PREFACE.,May the blessing of our Father in heaven rest upon the little book and
56,PREFACE.,all its mends.

113,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
114,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Oh! how I do wish I was rich!"" said Eliza Melvyn, dropping her work in"
115,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"her lap, and looking up discontentedly to her mother; ""why should not I"
116,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,be rich as well as Clara Payson? There she passes in her father's
117,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"carriage, with her fine clothes, and haughty ways; while I sit"
118,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,here--sew--sewing--all day long. I don't see what use I am in the world!
119,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
120,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Why should it be so? Why should one person have bread to waste, while"
121,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"another is starving? Why should one sit idle all day, while another"
122,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"toils all night? Why should one have so many blessings, and another so"
123,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"few?"""
124,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
125,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Eliza!"" said Mrs. Melvyn, taking her daughter's hand gently within her"
126,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"own, and pushing back the curls from her flushed brow, ""my daughter, why"
127,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"is this? why is your usual contentment gone, and why are you so sinfully"
128,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"complaining? Have you forgotten to think that 'God is ever good?'"""
129,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
130,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""No, mother,"" replied the young girl, ""but it sometimes appears strange"
131,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"to me, why he allows all these things."""
132,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
133,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Wiser people than either you or I have been led to wonder at these"
134,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"things,"" said Mrs. Melvyn; ""but the Christian sees in all the wisdom of"
135,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"God, who allows us to be tried here, and will overrule all for our good."
136,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,The very person who is envied for one blessing perhaps envies another
137,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"for one he does not possess. But why would you be rich, my child?"""
138,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
139,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Mother, I went this morning through a narrow, dirty street in another"
140,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,part of the city. A group of ragged children were collected round one
141,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,who was crying bitterly. I made my way through them and spoke to the
142,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"little boy. He told me his little sister was dead, his father was sick,"
143,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,and he was hungry. Here was sorrow enough for any one; but the little
144,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"boy stood there with his bare feet, his sunbleached hair and tattered"
145,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"clothes, and smiled almost cheerfully through the tears which washed"
146,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,white streaks amid the darkness of his dirty face. He led me to his
147,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_home_. Oh, mother! if you had been with me up those broken stairs, and"
148,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"seen the helpless beings in that dismal, dirty room you would have"
149,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"wished, like me, for the means to help them. The dead body lay there"
150,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"unburied, for the man said, they had no money to pay for a coffin. He"
151,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"was dying himself, and they might as well be buried together."""
152,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
153,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Are you sure, Eliza, that you have not the means to help them?"" asked"
154,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"Mrs. Melvyn. ""Put on your bonnet, my dear, and go to our sexton. Tell"
155,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,him to go and do what should be done. The charitable society of which I
156,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,am a member will pay the expense. Then call on Dr. ---- the dispensary
157,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"physician, and send him to the relief of the sick one. Then go to those"
158,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"of your acquaintance who have, as you say, 'bread to waste,' and mention"
159,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,to them this hungry little boy. If you have no money to give these
160,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"sufferers, you have a voice to plead with those who have; and thus you"
161,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"may bless the poor, while you doubly bless the rich, for 'It is more"
162,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"blessed to give than to receive.'"""
163,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
164,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"Eliza obeyed, and when she returned several hours after, her face"
165,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"glowing with animation, and eagerly recounted how much had been done for"
166,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,the poor family; how their dead had been humanely borne from their
167,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"sight; how the sick man was visited by the physician, and his bitterness"
168,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,of spirit removed by the sympathy which was sent him; how the room was
169,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"to be cleaned and ventilated, and how she left the little boy eating a"
170,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"huge slice of bread, while others of the family were half devouring the"
171,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"remainder of the loaf; her mother listened with the same gentleness. ""It"
172,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"is well, my daughter,"" said she; ""I preferred to send you on this errand"
173,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"of sympathy, that you might see how much you could do with small means."""
174,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
175,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""I have a picture here,"" she continued, ""which I wish you to keep as a"
176,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,token of this day's feelings and actions. It is called 'The Widow's Pot
177,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"of Oil.' Will you read me the story which belongs to it?"""
178,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
179,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"Eliza took her little pocket Bible, the one that she always carried to"
180,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"the Sabbath school, and, turning to the fourth chapter of the second"
181,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"book of Kings, read the first seven verses. Turn to them now, children,"
182,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,and read them.
183,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
184,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""You can see in this picture,"" said her mother, ""how small was the 'pot"
185,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"of oil,' and how large were some of the vessels to be filled. Yet still"
186,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"it flowed on, a little stream; still knelt the widow in her faith,"
187,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,patiently supporting it; still brought her little sons the empty
188,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"vessels; the blessing of God was upon it, and they were all filled. She"
189,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,feared not that the oil would cease to flow; she stopped not when one
190,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"vessel was filled; she still believed, and labored, and waited, until"
191,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,her work was done.
192,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
193,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Take this picture, my daughter, and when you think that you cannot do"
194,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"good with small means, remember 'the widow's pot of oil,' and"
195,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"perseveringly use the means you have; when one labor is done, begin"
196,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,another; stitch by stitch you have made this beautiful garment; very
197,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,large houses are built of little bricks patiently joined together one by
198,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"one; and 'the widow's small pot of oil' filled many large vessels."""
199,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
200,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"""Oh, mother,"" said Eliza, ""I hope I shall never be so wicked again. I"
201,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"will keep the picture always. But, mother, do you not think Mr. Usher"
202,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,would like this picture to put in the 'Sabbath School Annual?' He might
203,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"have a smaller one engraved from this, you know, and perhaps cousin"
204,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"Julia will write something about it. I mean to ask them."""

216,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,A holy thing is sleep
217,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"On the worn spirit shed,"
218,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,And eyes that wake to weep;

221,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"From the world unseen by you,"
222,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Unto life's dim faded track."""
223,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
224,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"How beautiful, calm, and peaceful is sleep! Often, when I have laid my"
225,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"head upon my pillow happy and healthful, I have asked myself, to what"
226,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,shall I awaken? What changes may come ere again my head shall press this
227,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"pillow? Ah, little do we know what a day may unfold to us! We know not"
228,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,to what we shall awaken; what joy or sorrow. I do not know when I was
229,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"awakened to more painful intelligence, than when aroused one morning"
230,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"from pleasant dreams by the voice of a neighbor, saying that Mary Ellen,"
231,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"the only daughter of a near neighbor, was dying. She was a beautiful"
232,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"little girl, about three years of age, unlike most other children. She"
233,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,was more serious and thoughtful; and many predicted that her friends
234,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,would not have her long. She would often ask strange questions about
235,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,heaven and her heavenly Father; and many of her expressions were very
236,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,beautiful.
237,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
238,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,One day she asked permission of her mother to go and gather her some
239,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"flowers. Her mother gave her permission, but requested her not to go out"
240,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"of the field. After searching in vain for flowers, she returned with"
241,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"some clover leaves and blades of grass. ""Mother,"" said she, ""I could"
242,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"find you no flowers, but here are some spires of grass and clover"
243,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"leaves. Say that they are some pretty, mother. GOD made them."" Often,"
244,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"when she woke in the morning, she would ask her mother if it was the"
245,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Sabbath day. If told it was, ""Then,"" she would say, ""we will read the"
246,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Bible and keep the day holy."" Her mother always strove to render the"
247,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Sabbath interesting to her, and to have her spend it in a profitable"
248,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,manner. Nor did she fail; for little Mary Ellen was always happy when
249,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,the Sabbath morning came. The interest she took in the reading of the
250,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Scriptures, in explanations given of the plates in the Bible, and the"
251,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"accuracy with which she would remember all that was told her, were truly"
252,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"pleasing. Her kind and affectionate disposition, her love for all that"
253,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"was pure and holy, and her readiness to forgive and excuse all that she"
254,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"saw wrong in others, made her beloved by all who knew her. If she saw"
255,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"children at play on the Sabbath, or roaming about, she would notice it,"
256,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"and speak of it as being very wrong, and it would appear to wound her"
257,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"feelings; yet she would try to excuse them. ""It may be,"" she would say,"
258,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"""that they do not know that it is the holy Sabbath day. Perhaps no one"
259,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"has told them."" She could not bear to think of any one doing wrong"
260,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,intentionally.
261,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
262,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,Whenever she heard her little associates make use of any language that
263,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"she was not quite sure was right, she would ask her mother if it was"
264,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"wrong to speak thus; and if wrong, she would say, ""Then, I will never"
265,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"speak so, and I shall be your own dear little girl, and my heavenly"
266,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Father will love me."" We often ask children whom they love best. Such"
267,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"was the question often put to Mary Ellen. She would always say, ""I love"
268,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"my heavenly Father best, and my dear father and mother next."" Her first"
269,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"and best affections were freely given to her Maker, not from a sense of"
270,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"duty alone did it seem, but from a heart overflowing with love and"
271,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"gratitude; and never, at the hour of retiring, would she forget to kneel"
272,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,and offer up her evening prayer. Thus she lived.
273,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
274,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,Now I will lead you to her dying pillow Many friends were around her.
275,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,No one had told her that she was dying; yet she herself felt conscious
276,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"of it. She wished to have the window raised, that she might see the"
277,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"ocean and trees once more. ""Oh!"" said her mother, bending over her, ""is"
278,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"my dear little girl dying?"" ""I want to go,"" said Mary Ellen; ""I want my"
279,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"father and mother to go with me."" ""Will you not stay with us?"" said the"
280,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"stricken father; ""will you not stay with us?"" She raised her little"
281,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"hands and eyes--""Oh no,"" said she; ""I see them! I see them! 't is"
282,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"lighter there; I want to go; get a coffin and go with me, father. 'T is"
283,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"lighter there!"" She died soon after she ceased speaking. Her pure spirit"
284,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"winged its way to the blest home where we shall _all_ have more light,"
285,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,where the mortal shall put on immortality.
286,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
287,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,She died when flowers were fading; fit season for one of so gentle and
288,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,pure a nature to depart.
289,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
290,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"""In the cold, moist earth they laid her"
291,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"When the forest cast the leaf,"
292,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,And we wept that one so beautiful
293,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,Should have a life so brief.
294,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"And yet 't was not unmeet that one,"
295,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Like that young friend of ours,"
296,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"So gentle and so beautiful,"
297,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Should perish with the flowers."""
298,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
299,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"But Oh! when that little form was laid in the cold grave,--when the"
300,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"childless parents returned to their lonely home, once made so happy by"
301,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"the smile of their departed child,--Oh! who can express or describe"
302,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,their anguish! In her they had all they could ask in a child; she was
303,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,their only one. Everything speaks to their hearts of _her_; but her
304,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,light step and happy voice fall not upon their ears; to them the flowers
305,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,that she loved have a mournful language. The voice of the wind sighing
306,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,in the trees has to them a melancholy tone. The light laugh of little
307,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"children, coming in at the open window,--the singing of birds which she"
308,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"delighted to hear,--but speak to their hearts of utter loneliness. They"
309,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,feel that the little form they had nursed with so much care and
310,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"tenderness, so often pressed to their bosoms, is laid beneath the sod."
311,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"Yet the sweet consolation which religion affords, cheered and sustained"
312,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,the afflicted parents in their hours of deepest sorrow. They would not
313,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,call their child back. They feel that she has reached her heavenly home.
314,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,Happy must they have been in yielding up to its Maker a spirit so pure.
315,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,
316,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,Two years Mary Ellen has been sleeping in the little grave-yard. Since
317,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"then another little daughter has been given her parents,--a promising"
318,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"little bud, that came with the spring flowers, to bless and cheer the"
319,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"home which was made so desolate. The best wish I have for the parents,"
320,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"and all I ask for the child, is, that it may be like little Mary Ellen."
321,BY MRS. MARGARET M. MASON.,"I have an earnest wish, too that all little children who read this"

361,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"Expectation is not desire, nor desire hope. We may _expect_ misfortune,"
362,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"sickness, poverty, while from these evils we would fain escape. Bending"
363,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"over the couches of the sick and suffering, we may _desire_ their"
364,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"restoration to health, while the hectic flush and the rapid beating of"
365,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,the heart assure us that no effort of kindness or skill can prolong
366,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"their days upon the earth. _Hope_ is directed to some future good, and"
367,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,it implies not only an ardent desire that our future may be fair and
368,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"unclouded, but an expectation that our wishes will, at length, be"
369,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"granted, and our plans be crowned with large success. Hence hope"
370,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"animates us to exertion and diligence, and always imparts pleasure and"
371,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"gladness, while our fondest wishes cost us anxiety and tears."

373,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"There are _false_ and _delusive_ hopes, which bring us, at last, to"

375,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"pursuits and traffics on which the laws of truth, love, and justice,"
376,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"must ever darkly frown. They forget that wealth, with all its splendor,"
377,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,can only be deemed a good and desirable gift when sought as an
378,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"instrument to advance noble and beneficent aims,--when we are the"

385,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,There are some who have a strong desire for the praise and stations of

388,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"will occupy the attention of a good and noble heart, except it opens a"
389,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"better opportunity for philanthropic labor, and is conferred as the free"

395,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"hopes are delusive, and such expectations will suddenly perish. Let"
396,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"fools laugh and mock at sin, and live as if God were not; but consider"

406,BY REV. H.B. NYE.,"manly effort by its promises of success, and leads us to virtue and"

502,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
503,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
504,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Not many years ago, the beautiful hills and valleys of New England gave"
505,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"to the wild Indian a home, and its bright waters and quiet forests"
506,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,furnished him with food. Rude wigwams stood where now ascends the hum of
507,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the populous city, and council-fires blazed amid the giant trees which"
508,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,have since bowed before the axe of the settler. Between that rude age
509,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and the refinement of the present day, many and fearful were the strifes"
510,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"of the red owner of the land with the invading white man, who, having"
511,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"crossed the waters of the Atlantic, sought to drive him from his"
512,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,hitherto undisputed possessions. The recital of deeds of inhuman cruelty
513,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,which characterized that period; the rehearsal of bloody massacres of
514,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"inoffensive women and innocent children, which those cruel savages"
515,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"delighted in, would even now curdle the blood with horror, and make one"
516,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,sick at heart.
517,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
518,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,It was in this period of fearful warfare that the events occurred which
519,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,form the foundation of the following story.
520,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
521,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Not far from the year 1680, a small colony was planted on the banks of"
522,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,the beautiful Connecticut. A little company from the sea-side found
523,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"their way, through the tangled and pathless woods, to the meadows that"
524,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"lay sleeping on the banks of this bright river; and here, after having"
525,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,felled the mighty trees whose brows had long been kissed by the pure
526,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"heavens, they erected their humble cottages; and began to till the rich"
527,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,alluvial soil. The colonists were persevering and industrious; and soon
528,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"a little village grew up beside the shining stream, fields of Indian"
529,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"corn waved their wealth of tasselled heads in the breezes, the"
530,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,rudely-constructed school-house echoed with the cheerful hum of the
531,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"little students, and a rustic church was dedicated to the God of the"
532,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Pilgrims. He who officiated as the spiritual teacher of this new parish,"
533,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,also instructed the children during the week. A man he was of no
534,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"inferior mind, or neglected education; of fervent, but austere piety,"
535,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,possessing a bold spirit and a benevolent heart. His family consisted of
536,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"a wife and two daughters; Emma, the elder, was a girl of eight summers,"
537,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and Anna, the younger, was about five."
538,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
539,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,Never were children so frolicsome and mirth-loving as were Emma and Anna
540,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Wilson, the daughters of the minister. Not the grave admonitions of"
541,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"their mother, or the severe reproofs of their stern father; not their"
542,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"many confinements in dark and windowless closets, or the memory of"
543,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"afternoons, when, supperless, they had been sent to bed while the sun"
544,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"was yet high in the heavens; not the fear of certain punishment, or the"
545,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"suasion of kindness, could tame their wild natures, or force them into"
546,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"anything like woman-like sobriety. Hand in hand, they would wander amid"
547,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the aisles of mossy-trunked trees, plucking the flowers that carpeted"
548,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the earth; now digging for ground-nuts, now turning over the leaves for"
549,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,acorns; sometimes they would watch the nibbling squirrel as he nimbly
550,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"sprang from tree to tree, or overpower, with their boisterous laughter,"
551,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,the gushing melody of the bobolink; they mocked the querulous cat-bird
552,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and the cawing crow, started at the swift winging of the shy blackbird,"
553,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,and stood still to listen to the sweet song of the clear-throated
554,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,thrush; now they bathed their feet in the streamlets that went singing
555,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"on their way to the Connecticut, and then, throwing up handfuls of the"
556,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"running water, which fell again upon their heads, they laughed right"
557,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,merrily at their self-baptism. They were happy as the days were long;
558,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"but wild as their playfellows, the birds, the streams, and the"
559,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,squirrels.
560,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
561,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"One beautiful Sabbath morning in July, their mother dressed them tidily"
562,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"in their best frocks, and tying on their snow-white sun-bonnets, she"
563,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"sent them to church nearly an hour before she started with their father,"
564,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"that they might walk leisurely, and have opportunity to get rested"
565,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,before the commencement of services. But it was not until near the
566,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,middle of the sermon that the little rogues made their appearance. With
567,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"glowing faces, hair that had strayed from its ungraceful confinement to"
568,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"float in golden curls over their necks and shoulders,--with bonnets,"
569,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"shoes and stockings tied together and swinging over each arm,--with"
570,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dresses rent, ripped, soiled and stained, and up-gathered aprons filled"
571,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"with berries, blossoms, pebbles, fresh-water shells and bright sand,"
572,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"they stole softly to where their mother was sitting, much to her"
573,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"mortification, and greatly to the horror of their pious father."
574,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
575,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"For this offence, they were forbidden to accompany their parents, on the"
576,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"next Sabbath, to church, but were condemned to close confinement in the"
577,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"house during the long, bright, summer day--a severer punishment than"
578,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"which, could not have been inflicted. When the hour of assembling for"
579,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"worship was announced by the old English clock that stood in the corner,"
580,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,the curtains were drawn before the windows; two bowls of bread and milk
581,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,were placed on the dresser for their dinner; a lesson in the Testament
582,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"was assigned to Emma, and one in the Catechism to Anna; a strict"
583,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"injunction to remain all day in the house was laid upon both, and Mr."
584,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and Mrs. Wilson departed, locking the door, and taking the key. The"
585,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,children soon wiped away the tears that their hard fate had gathered in
586,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"their eyes, and applied themselves to their tasks, which were speedily"
587,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,committed. Then the forenoon wore slowly away; they dared not get their
588,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"playthings,--they were forbidden to go out doors,--and the only books in"
589,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the room were the Bible, Watts' Hymns, and the Pilgrim's Progress, which"
590,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"lay on the highest shelf in the room, far beyond their reach. Noon came"
591,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"at last; the sun shone fully in at the south window, betokening the"
592,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dinner hour, and then their dinner of bread and milk was eaten. What"
593,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"were they next to do? Sorrowfully they gazed on the smiling river, the"
594,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"green corn-fields, the large potato-plats, the grazing cattle, the"
595,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"blooming flower-beds, and the shady walks which led far into the cool"
596,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,recesses of the forest; and earnestly did they long for liberty to
597,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,ramble out in the glorious sunshine. As they were gazing wistfully
598,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"through the window, they saw their playful little kitten, Fanny, dart"
599,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"like lightning from her hiding-place in the garden, where she had long"
600,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"lain in ambush, and fasten her sharp claws in the back of a poor little"
601,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"ground-bird, which had been hopping from twig to twig, chirping and"
602,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"twittering very cheerfully. The little bird fluttered, gasped, and"
603,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"uttered wailing cries, as it ineffectually labored to free itself from"
604,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the power of its captor, until Emma and Anna, unable longer to witness"
605,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"its distress, sprang out the window, and, rushing down the garden,"
606,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"liberated the little prisoner, and with delight saw it fly away towards"
607,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,the woods.
608,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
609,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Delighted to find themselves once more in the open air, the joyful"
610,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"children forgot the prohibition of their parents, and leaping over the"
611,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dear little brook with which they loved to run races, they filled their"
612,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,aprons with the blue-eyed violets that grew on its margin. On they
613,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"bounded, further and further, and a few moments more found them in the"
614,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dense wood, where not a sunbeam could reach the ground. But suddenly the"
615,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"leaves rustled behind them, and the twigs cracked, and there sprung,"
616,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"from an ambuscade in the thicket, the tall figure of an Indian, who laid"
617,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"a strong hand on the arm of each little girl, and, despite the cries,"
618,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"tears, and entreaties of the poor children, hurried them deeper into the"
619,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"forest, where they found a large body of these cruel savages, clad in"
620,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"moose and deer skins, armed with bows and arrows, tomahawks, and"
621,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"muskets. The children were questioned concerning the village, the"
622,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"occupation of the inhabitants on that day, and the number of men at"
623,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"home, and they replied correctly and intelligibly. A consultation was"
624,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"then held among the Indians, which resulted in a determination to attack"
625,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the village; and forthwith, leaving but one behind to guard the little"
626,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"prisoners, they made a descent on the quiet settlement, burning and"
627,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,ravaging buildings on their way to the church. But they did not find the
628,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"body of worshippers unarmed, as they doubtless expected; for, in those"
629,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"days of peril and savage warfare, men worshipped God armed with musket"
630,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and bayonet, and the hand that was lifted in prayer to heaven would"
631,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"often, at the next moment, draw the gleaming sword from its sheath. At"
632,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the meeting-house, the savages met with a warm repulse; and were so"
633,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"surprised and affrighted that they retreated back into the wild woods,"
634,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"after wounding but one or two colonists, among whom was Mr. Wilson,"
635,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,Emma's and Anna's father.
636,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
637,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"The Indians commenced, about dark, a journey to the settlement where"
638,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"they belonged, taking the stolen children with them; they reached their"
639,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"destination early on the second day of their travel. Rough, indeed,"
640,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,seemed the Indian village to the white children: the houses were only
641,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"wigwams, made by placing poles obliquely in the ground, and fastening"
642,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"them at the top, covered on the outside with bark, and lined on the"
643,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"inside with mats; some containing but one family, others a great many."
644,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"The furniture consisted of mats for beds, curiously wrought baskets to"
645,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"hold corn, and strings of wampum which served for ornaments. Into one of"
646,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the smallest of these wigwams Emma and Anna were carried, and were given"
647,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"to the wife of one of the chief warriors, who had but one child of her"
648,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"own,--Winona was her name, which signifies the first-born,--a"
649,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"bright-eyed, pleasant, winning little girl of two years of age. The"
650,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"mother scrutinized them closely, but the child appeared overjoyed to see"
651,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"them, and wiped away their tears with her little hand, and, jabbering in"
652,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"her unknown language, seemed begging them not to cry. This interested"
653,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the mother, and she soon looked more kindly upon them, and set before"
654,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"them food. But they were too sorrowful to eat, and were glad to be shown"
655,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"a mat, where they were to sleep. Locked in each others' arms, cheek"
656,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"pressed to cheek, they lay and wept as if their hearts were broken."
657,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
658,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"""Let us pray to God,"" whispered Emma, after the inmates of the wigwam"
659,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"were reposing in slumber, ""and ask Him to bring us again to our father"
660,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and mother."""
661,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
662,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"So they rose, and knelt in the dark wigwam, with their arms about one"
663,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"another's necks, and their tears flowing together, and offered to God"
664,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,their childish prayer:
665,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
666,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"""Our Father in Heaven, love us poor children; take care of us; forgive"
667,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"us for doing wrong, and help us be good; take care of our dear parents;"
668,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"comfort them, and bring us again to meet them."""
669,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
670,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Then, more composed, and trusting in the blessed Father of us all, they"
671,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"fell asleep, and sweet were their slumbers, though far from their dear"
672,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"parents and home, for angels watched over them, and gave to them happy"
673,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,dreams.
674,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
675,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,A few days' residence among these untutored red men made Emma and Anna
676,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"great favorites among them; their pleasant dispositions, their good"
677,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"nature, and, above all, their love for the little Winona, which was"
678,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"fully reciprocated, endeared them to the father and mother of the Indian"
679,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"girl. Though sad at being separated from their parents, and though they"
680,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"often wept until they could weep no longer when they thought of home,"
681,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"yet their hearts, like those of all children, were easily consoled, and"
682,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,their spirits were so elastic that they could not long be depressed.
683,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Winona loved them tenderly; at night she slept between them, and during"
684,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,the day she would never leave them. She wore garlands of their
685,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"wreathing, listened to their English songs, stroked their rosy cheeks,"
686,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and frolicked with them in the woods, and beside the running brooks."
687,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
688,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,Two months passed away; all the Indian women in the village were
689,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,speaking of the love that had sprung up between the little white girls
690,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,and the copper-colored Winona; and many a hard hand smoothed the golden
691,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,curls of the little captives in token of affection. Then Winona was
692,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"taken sick; her body glowed with the fever-heat, her bright eyes became"
693,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dull, and day and night she moaned with pain. With surprising care and"
694,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"tenderness, Emma and Anna nursed the suffering child,--for to them were"
695,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"her glowing and burning hands extended for relief, rather than to her"
696,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"mother. They held her throbbing head, lulled her to sleep, bathed her"
697,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"hot temples, moistened her parched lips, and soothed her distresses; but"
698,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,they could not win her from the power of death--and she died!
699,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
700,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Oh, it was a sorrowful thing to them to part with their little"
701,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"playmate,--to see the damp earth heaped upon her lovely form, and to"
702,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"feel that she was forever hidden from their sight! They wept, and, with"
703,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the almost frantic mother, laid their faces on the tiny grave, and"
704,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,moistened it with their tears. Hither they often came to scatter the
705,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"freshest flowers, and to weep for the home they feared they would never"
706,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"again see; and here they often kneeled in united prayer to that God, who"
707,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"bends on prayerful children a loving eye, and spreads over them a"
708,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,shadowing wing.
709,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
710,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,The childless Indian woman now loved them more than ever; but the death
711,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"of Winona had opened afresh the fountains of their grief, and often did"
712,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,she find them weeping so bitterly that she could not comfort them. She
713,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"would draw them to her bosom, and tenderly caress them; but it all"
714,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"availed not, and when the month of October came, with its sere foliage"
715,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and fading flowers, Emma and Anna had grown so thin, and pale, and"
716,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"feeble, from their wearing home-sickness, that they stayed all day in"
717,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the wigwam, going out only to visit Winona's grave. They drooped and"
718,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"drooped, and those who saw them said, ""The white children will die, and"
719,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"lie down with Winona."""
720,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
721,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"The Indian mother gazed on their pallid faces, and wept; she loved them,"
722,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"and could not bear to part with them; but she saw they would die, and"
723,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"calling her husband, she bade him convey them to the home of their"
724,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,father. Many were the tears she shed at parting with them; and when they
725,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"disappeared among the thick trees, she threw herself, in an agony of"
726,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"grief, upon the mats within the wigwam."
727,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
728,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,It was Sabbath noon when the children arrived in sight of their
729,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"father's house; here the Indian left them, and plunged again into the"
730,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"depths of the forest. They could gain no admittance into the house, and"
731,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"they hastened to the meeting-house, where they hoped to find their"
732,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,parents. They reached the church; the congregation was singing;
733,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"silently, and unobserved, they entered, and seated themselves at the"
734,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,remotest part of the building. The singing ceased; there was a momentary
735,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"pause, and their father rose before them. Oh, how he was changed! Pale,"
736,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"very pale, thin and sad was his dear face; and Emma's and Anna's hearts"
737,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"smote them, as being the cause of this change. They leaned forward to"
738,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"catch a glimpse of their mother, but in her accustomed seat sat a lady"
739,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dressed in black, and this, they thought, could not be her; they little"
740,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"supposed that their parents mourned for them as for the dead, believing"
741,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,they should see them no more.
742,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
743,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Mr. Wilson took his text from Psalms: ""It is good for me that I have"
744,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"been afflicted."" With a tremulous voice, he spoke of their recent"
745,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"afflictions; of the sudden invasion of the colony, the burning of their"
746,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"dwellings, the wounding of some of their number, and then his tones"
747,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"became more deeply tremulous, for he spoke of his children. The sobs of"
748,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"his sympathizing people filled the house, and the anguish of the"
749,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"father's feelings became so intense, that he bowed his head upon the"
750,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,Bible and wept aloud. The hearts of the children palpitated with
751,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"emotion; their sobs arose above all others; and, taking each other by"
752,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the hand, the wan, emaciated, badly-dressed little girls hastened to the"
753,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"pulpit, where stood their father, with his face bowed upon the leaves of"
754,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the Holy Book, and laying their hand upon his passive arm, they sobbed"
755,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"forth, ""Father! Father!"" He raised his head, gazed eagerly and wildly"
756,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"upon the children, and comprehending at once the whole scene, the"
757,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"revulsion of feeling that came over him was so great,--the sorrow for"
758,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"the dead being instantly changed into joy for the living,--that he"
759,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"staggered backwards, and would have fallen but for the timely support of"
760,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,a chair.
761,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
762,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,The whole house was in instant confusion; in a moment they were clasped
763,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"in their mother's arms, and kisses and tears and blessings were mingled"
764,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"together upon their white, thin cheeks. ""Let us thank God for the return"
765,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"of our children,"" said the pastor; and all kneeling reverently, he"
766,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"thanked our merciful heavenly Father, in the warm and glowing language"
767,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"of a deeply grateful heart, for restoring to his arms those whom he had"
768,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,wept as lost to him forever.
769,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
770,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"Oh, there was joy in that village that night again and again the"
771,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"children told their interesting story, and those who listened forgot to"
772,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"chide their disobedience, or to harshly reprove. Need I tell you how"
773,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,they were pressed to the bosoms of the villagers; how tears were shed
774,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"for their sufferings, and those of the little lost Winona, whom they did"
775,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"not forget; how caresses were lavished upon them, and prayers offered to"
776,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"God, that their lives, which he had so wonderfully preserved, might be"
777,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"spent in usefulness and piety? No, I need not, for you can imagine it"
778,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,all.
779,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,
780,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,The sermon which was so happily interrupted by the return of the
781,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,children was the first Mr. Wilson had attempted to preach since the day
782,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"they were stolen; the wounds he that day received, and the illness that"
783,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"immediately afterwards ensued, with his unutterable grief for the loss"
784,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"of his children, had confined him mostly to his bed during their"
785,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"absence. On the next Sabbath, Emma and Anna accompanied their father and"
786,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"mother once more to church, when Mr. Wilson preached from these words:"
787,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"""Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy endureth"
788,BY MRS. M.A. LIVERMORE.,"forever."""

798,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
799,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Of all places in the wide world, my own early home excepted, none seem"
800,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,to me more pleasing in memory than my grandmother's cottage. Very often
801,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"did I visit it in my boyhood, and well acquainted with its appearance"
802,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"within, and with almost every object around it, did I become. It stood"
803,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"in a quiet nook in the midst of the woods, about five miles from the"
804,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,pleasant seaport where I was born. The cottage was not a spacious one.
805,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,It had but few rooms in it; but it was amply large for my aged
806,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"grandparents, I remember. They lived happily there. My grandfather was"
807,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,somewhat infirm; my grandmother was a very vigorous person for one of
808,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,seventy-five; this was her age at the time of my first recollection of
809,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,her. She used to walk from her cottage to our home; and once I walked
810,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"with her, but was exceedingly mortified that I could not endure the walk"
811,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,so well as she did.
812,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
813,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"I used to love this cottage home, because it was so quiet, and in the"
814,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,summer time so delighting to me. I believe I received some of my very
815,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,first lessons in the love of nature in this place. It was a charming
816,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"summer or winter retreat. If the sun shone warmly down anywhere, it was"
817,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"here. If the wind blew kindly anywhere, it was around the snug cottage,"
818,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,sheltered as it was on every side by the tall old pines. If the robin's
819,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"note came earliest anywhere in the spring-time, it was from the large"
820,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,spreading apple-tree just at the foot of the little garden lot. How
821,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"often has my young heart been delighted with his song there! And then,"
822,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,what sweet chanting I have heard in those woods all the day from the
823,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"thrush and sparrow, yellow-bird and oriole! How their mellow voices"
824,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"would seem to echo in the noon-silence, or at the sunset hour, as though"
825,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,they were singing anthems in some vast cathedral! They were; and what
826,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"anthems of nature's harmony and praise! God heard them, and was"
827,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,glorified.
828,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
829,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,It seemed to me that every animate thing was made to be happy. I loved
830,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"to stand beneath a tall old hemlock in a certain part of the wood, and"
831,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"watch the squirrels as they skipped and ran so swiftly along the wall,"
832,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"or from branch to branch, or up and down the trees. Their chattering"
833,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,made a fine accompaniment to the bird-songs. And here I learned to
834,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"indulge a fondness for the very crows, which to this day I have never"
835,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"outgrown. Though they have been denounced as mischievous, and bounties"
836,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"have been set upon them, I never could find it in my heart to indulge in"
837,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,the warring propensity against them. They always seemed to me such
838,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"social company--issuing from some edge of the woodland, and slowly"
839,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"flapping their black wings, and flocking out into the clearing, huddling"
840,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"overhead, and sailing away, chatting so loudly and heartily all the"
841,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"while, and reminding the whole neighborhood that when we have life, it"
842,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,is best to let others know it! Yes--the cawing crows have been company
843,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"for me in many a solitary ramble; and whenever I hear them, I inwardly"
844,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"pay my respects to them. All these, and other familiar sights and"
845,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"sounds, did I richly enjoy at the old cottage in the woods."
846,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
847,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"I loved to sit at the shed-door, and watch my grandfather at his slow"
848,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"work; for he had been a mechanic in his day, and was able to do a little"
849,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,very moderately at his trade now. He would tell me the history of the
850,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"old people in the neighborhood, and of the customs and fashions when"
851,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,they were boys and girls; and my eyes and ears were open to hear him. I
852,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,used to wish I could see them just as they looked when they were
853,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,children. It was very difficult then for me to imagine how those who
854,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,had become so wrinkled could ever have had the smooth faces of infants
855,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,and children. But my grandfather could remember when he was a boy; and
856,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"his father had told him what things were done when he, too, was a boy."
857,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"And so I concluded that wrinkles were no disgrace, nor the fairest faces"
858,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,of the young any protection against them.
859,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
860,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"My grandmother was very fond of me, and took great pleasure in having me"
861,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"read to her, as her eyesight had become somewhat dim. And so I used to"
862,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"load myself with story-books and newspapers, when I became older, to"
863,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"carry and read to her. And such times as we had with them! Voyages,"
864,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"travels, discoveries, adventures, perils,--the wonders of the world, the"
865,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"wonders of science, the wonders of history,--all came in for their share"
866,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"of reading. Though I should read myself tired and sleepy, my grandmother"
867,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"would still be an interested listener. Since I have been a minister, I"
868,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,have often wished that many hearers would as eagerly listen to what I
869,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"had to say especially to them, as did my aged grandmother to my young"
870,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,words then.
871,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
872,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,Those sunny days have departed. The old cottage is not there now. Years
873,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"ago it was taken down. My grandfather died when I was yet a boy, and I"
874,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,followed him to the grave with a heavy heart. My grandmother lived to
875,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"be almost a hundred years old,--her powers all gone, and she helpless."
876,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"It would sometimes, even in my manhood, deeply affect me to have her"
877,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"look into my face with no sign in hers that she knew me, when she had"
878,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"once loved her talkative and delighted grandchild so fondly. But she,"
879,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"too, found her resting-place at last beside her companion. Peace to"
880,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"them! They blest me with their kindly, cheering words when most I needed"
881,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"them, and I will bless their memories. And peace to the spot where once"
882,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"stood their quiet home! Wherever in life I may be,--however brightly its"
883,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"pleasures may shine, or heavily its cares and afflictions press upon"
884,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,me--never would I outgrow the inspiration of these early enjoyments;
885,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"never forget, that, however the great, proud, and contentious world may"
886,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"distract and dishearten, there will yet be peace to the humble and"
887,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,virtuous soul in many a nook like that which sheltered and blest my
888,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,grand mother's cottage.

897,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,It is now many years since a near friend of mine uttered his first oath.
898,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,We were very intimate in our youthful days. I have thought that I would
899,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"write a little story about him, for some of the little folks of these"
900,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"times to read, hoping that it will not only be interesting, but do them"
901,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,good; for I am indeed sorry to know that swearing is a very common sin
902,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,among the boys of our times.
903,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
904,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,The parents of my young playfellow were of the humbler class in society;
905,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"they were industrious and prudent, and took great pains to teach him"
906,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"what was right. They lived in the metropolis of New England, where my"
907,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"schoolmate was born. His father wrought with the saw, the plane, the"
908,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"hammer, and such tools as carpenters use about their business. His home"
909,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"was a neat, wooden two-story house, in one of the streets of that part"
910,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"of Boston which was generally known, when we were boys, by the name of"
911,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,the MILL-POND. I suppose that most of my little readers who live in the
912,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,city can tell where it is. Many changes have taken place there since my
913,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"childhood. When I was a small boy it was called the _town_,--now we"
914,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,never hear of it but as the _city_ of Boston. Its population has
915,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,increased rapidly; its territory has been extended; it has grown in
916,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"wealth, in splendor, in its means for mental and moral improvement; in"
917,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"the number and convenience of its public schools,--the pride and"
918,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"ornament, or the disgrace, of any place. Yes, Boston is not, in"
919,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"appearance or in fact, what it once was."
920,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
921,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,But I am getting off from my story. I was saying that my young friend
922,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"resided on the ""new-land""--no; the ""Mill-Pond;""--well, it's all the"
923,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"same--for when they dug down old Beacon Hill, they threw the dirt into"
924,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"the Mill-Pond, and when it was filled up, or made land, the spot was"
925,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"still known as the Mill-Pond, and oftentimes was called the new-land. In"
926,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"later years, there have been other portions added to the city, by making"
927,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"wharves, and filling up where the tide used to ebb and flow, and where"
928,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,large vessels could float.
929,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
930,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,But again I am digressing too far from the story.
931,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
932,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"So soon as my friend was old enough, he was sent to one of the primary"
933,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"schools, and was a pretty constant scholar at that, and afterwards at a"
934,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"grammar school, till he was about twelve years old. He was, of course,"
935,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"much with other lads of his own age, and some who were older and"
936,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"younger than himself. He was, also, often in the streets, and as there"
937,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"were a great many people who used profane language in those days,--as"
938,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"there are at the present time,--he heard much of it; yet he had been so"
939,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,carefully trained that he did not for years utter wicked words.
940,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
941,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"It is always painful to most persons, old as well as young, to hear"
942,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"profanity, even though it be very common in their hearing, if they are"
943,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,never accustomed to its use.
944,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
945,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,My young friend had been taught to reverence the name of that great
946,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,Being who made heaven and earth and all things. He was a member of a
947,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"Sabbath school, and thus had much valuable advice from his faithful"
948,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,teacher to govern his conduct in word and deed. For a while he heeded
949,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"this, and was careful of his moral character. But by-and-by, he"
950,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,overstepped the bounds of right.
951,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
952,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"It is very true that ""evil communications corrupt good manners;"" and"
953,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"that if one would not be bad, one means of safety is to keep out of bad"
954,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,company.
955,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
956,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"My friend was, in a few years, placed in a store, where there was a"
957,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,large business carried on. He came in contact with persons who were not
958,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,so carefully instructed as he had been. They made no hesitation in
959,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,pronouncing the names of God and Jesus Christ in a blasphemous and
960,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,profane manner. He resisted the pernicious influence of their example
961,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"for a while, but at last it became so familiar to his ears, that he"
962,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,could hear wicked words spoken without even a thrill of horror in his
963,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,bosom.
964,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
965,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"He, however, had not the disposition to speak them, till one day, when"
966,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"some little thing in the store did not suit him, his passion was"
967,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"aroused, and, in the angry excitement of the moment, he spoke out,--and"
968,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"in that unguarded expression there was profanity,--a miserable,"
969,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"blasphemous, wicked word. He had uttered his _first oath._ The"
970,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,disposition had been lurking in his heart for several days to do this;
971,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,but he had not been able to so far lower his moral sense as to do it
972,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"before. Now he felt as though he had done a brave act,--that he had"
973,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"achieved something very grand. But soon, very soon, conscience whispered"
974,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,her gentle yet severe rebuke. She complained sadly of the wickedness
975,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,that was done. The blush of shame mantled his cheek. Remorse took hold
976,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,on his spirit. He looked about to see who was upbraiding him; but none
977,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,seemed to notice it. He resolved that he would not again give occasion
978,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,for such feelings of regret and sorrow to himself as he then felt.
979,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
980,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"Could you have then looked into his heart, you would have pitied him."
981,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"This resolution he kept a few weeks, when, being a little irritated, he"
982,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,a second time profaned the holy name of Deity. This time he felt some
983,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"compunctions of conscience, but they were not as powerful as before; the"
984,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"first step had been already taken, and a second was much easier."
985,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
986,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"I need not go on to tell you how he, not long after, broke a second"
987,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"resolution, and so on, till, ere many months, he had become really a"
988,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,swearing young man.
989,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
990,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,It all sprang from the first sinful act; and when at last he did break
991,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"himself of the habit, it was not done without a serious struggle."
992,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
993,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"I have told you this story, my young readers, because I thought it might"
994,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"be, not only interesting to you, but because I hoped it might be the"
995,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,means of leading you to reflect upon the uselessness and wickedness of
996,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,PROFANITY; and that it might aid in impressing on your minds the
997,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,importance of governing your passions and keeping your tongues free from
998,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,evil speaking.
999,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,
1000,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"I see my friend, about whom I have written, quite often. He is now a"
1001,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"parent, and occupies an eminent position in the community; but he often"
1002,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"thinks of his former life, and says he has not yet ceased to lament his"
1003,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"FIRST OATH. Let this fact, then, teach you how a recollection of the"
1004,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"sins of boyhood, even though you may call them little sins, will be"
1005,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"cherished through life, and poison many moments that would otherwise be"
1006,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,happy ones. How important that childhood be pure and righteous in the
1007,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,"sight of God, and to our own consciences, in order to insure a happy"
1008,BY REV. EBEN FRANCIS.,manhood and old age!

1143,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.
1144,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1145,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"When I was a little child, younger than those for whom this book is"
1146,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"written, my home was in a valley. The usual appendages to a farm-house,"
1147,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the garden, orchard and small pasture grounds, lay very near it; and I"
1148,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,was as familiar with these enclosures as with the rooms of the house. A
1149,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"little further off there was a mimic river, which, as it wound about,"
1150,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"divided itself into different streams, and surrounded little islands,"
1151,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"shaded with the tall plane tree and the flexible willow. Here, too, with"
1152,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"those who were old enough to be careful in crossing the rustic bridges,"
1153,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,I sometimes played on summer afternoons;--gathered the prettiest flowers
1154,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"in the sweetest little woods, and dipped my feet into the clear running"
1155,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,water.
1156,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1157,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"Beyond these there lay less frequented fields, which rose gradually, at"
1158,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"no very great distance, into a range of hills as green as the valley"
1159,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"below. One of them was covered all over its summit, and a little way"
1160,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"down its sides, with some dark old woods. The trees which grew there"
1161,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"were very tall, and so large that their thick and heavy tops seemed to"
1162,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"crowd together, so that you might have walked on them almost as well as"
1163,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"upon the hill itself. I loved sometimes, when the air was full of the"
1164,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"bright sunshine, to look at the rich shades of green upon those"
1165,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"tree-tops; but if ever my eye rested, for a moment only, upon the dark"
1166,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,and mysterious avenues which led into the depths of the wood beneath
1167,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"them, there would creep such a chill to my heart,--such a feeling of"
1168,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"dread would come over me,--that I turned quickly to the glad-looking"
1169,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"homestead, that I might again grow warm and happy."
1170,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1171,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,At first it was probably no more than the idea that those woods formed a
1172,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,limit to the world of light and gladness in which I lived. My eye could
1173,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"not penetrate their dimness, and with a childish, human feeling I shrank"
1174,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"from the undiscovered and unknown. But as I grew older, and read the"
1175,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"stories in the small books which were given to me for presents, or lent"
1176,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"by my little friends, I had other and plainer reasons for the"
1177,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,apprehensive feeling with which I looked at the woods. I found that
1178,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,children had been so lost among their thickets as hardly to be found
1179,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"again; and that two poor little orphans, left there on purpose, had lain"
1180,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,down and died of hunger and weariness; and the birds covered them over
1181,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,with leaves. Strange birds I thought there were in the woods. Then the
1182,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"fairies that dwelt there, and the strange elfin creatures, and the"
1183,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,perils that travellers fell into with robbers and wild beasts; and still
1184,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,I referred the scene of every story I read directly to those very woods
1185,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"upon the hill-side, although they were so near that I could see them"
1186,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,plainly enough from the windows of the cheerful rooms at home.
1187,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1188,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,Time passed along in its usual way; but before I had acquired knowledge
1189,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"or strength of mind enough to correct my early impressions of the woods,"
1190,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"I had permission, one bright afternoon in June, to go with an older"
1191,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,sister to a strawberry meadow across the creek. We were accompanied by
1192,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"some little maidens, who were older and more adventurous than me; and so"
1193,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,it happened that when we did not find the fruit so abundant as we could
1194,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"wish, they persuaded us to go into another field, and then into another,"
1195,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"I little thought where, until I became suddenly sensible of a shaded"
1196,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"light around me, of a breeze a little cooler than that which tempered"
1197,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the warm air of the valley, and a low, wild music that I had never heard"
1198,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"before; and looking up, I saw that we were actually upon the ascent of"
1199,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,the hill which led up to the dreaded woods.
1200,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1201,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"Strange and almost horror-struck as I felt, I did not scream out,"
1202,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"(perhaps I should not have had breath to do so,) but I gathered up all"
1203,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the wisdom that my little heart could boast, into the resolution not to"
1204,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"look at the woods, not to think of them; for we should soon go back"
1205,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"again, I thought, and nothing would happen. And my young friends can"
1206,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"judge how terrified I must have grown, when I heard one of the girls"
1207,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,begin to talk of the beautiful flowers her brother had brought her from
1208,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the woods, and end by proposing that we should go there, and get some"
1209,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,for ourselves. I waited breathlessly to hear the objections which I
1210,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"doubted not would be urged against this plan, but none were offered; and"
1211,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"when I ventured to remonstrate, they paid so little attention to me,"
1212,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,that my pride was hurt at the thought of saying any more.
1213,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1214,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"There was another way in which my pride was at work. I was ashamed,"
1215,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"among those who were so brave, to own that I was afraid; so, though I"
1216,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"held the hands of those who led me pretty tight, and gave them some"
1217,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"little trouble to pull me along, they knew nothing more of my reluctance"
1218,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,to go with them.
1219,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1220,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,We got up the hill very fast; so at least it seemed to me. Here and
1221,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"there a solitary tree, a few feet in advance, looked as if it had"
1222,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,stepped out to welcome and encourage us to pass on; and I cannot say
1223,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,that my strength did not revive a little as I passed under the heavy
1224,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"branches, and out again into the freer air. Be that as it may, it was"
1225,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"terrible enough to me, the approach to those woods. My companions were"
1226,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"eager and gay, and shouted out, as we entered them. They little thought"
1227,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"how overpowering were my feelings. And I little thought, myself, that I"
1228,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"was then and there to receive a lesson that I should never forget; one,"
1229,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"perhaps, that would do me more good than any other that I should ever"
1230,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,learn.
1231,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1232,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"At first, I was so frightened that my senses were all in confusion; but"
1233,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"as I gradually recovered the use of them, I took notice of the coolness"
1234,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"and the shade, and the dimness away in the distance; I heard the leafy"
1235,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"murmur above my head, the sweet notes that the birds were singing, and"
1236,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,the loud echoes. All these things seemed to blend together into
1237,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"something so solemn and so magnificent, that I began to feel for the"
1238,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"first time what it was to be a little child. With that, soon came a"
1239,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,feeling of confidence and even love. I thought that the majestic
1240,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"presence that filled the woods, whatever it was, would not hurt me, and"
1241,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"my heart grew so light at the thought, that I began to gather flowers"
1242,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"with the rest. How pretty they were! and what clean, shining leaves! And"
1243,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"here and there, wherever a little sunshine found an opening in the"
1244,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"branches and streamed down upon the bright green moss, it seemed so"
1245,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"golden, so clear, and so real, just as if I might clasp it in my hands!"
1246,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1247,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"I grew so much affected, at length, that I sobbed myself into tears, and"
1248,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"my sister said that I had never been in the woods before, and she would"
1249,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"take me home. I did not like to say that I wanted to stay longer, but"
1250,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"held to my flowers; and after I reached home, was washed and rested, I"
1251,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"went to the window, and remained there a long time, looking at the"
1252,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"woods. I did not quite comprehend all I had thought and felt, but it"
1253,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"seemed to me that a great truth, one that would do me good, had dawned"
1254,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,upon my mind.
1255,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1256,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,It was a long time before I fully understood the lesson. In a few weeks
1257,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,I caught one of those contagious diseases which children must have once;
1258,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"and it went so hard with me, that, before I was able to walk about, and"
1259,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"go out of the house, the leaves were all gone, and the snow had covered"
1260,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the ground. When spring returned I thought often of the woods, but I was"
1261,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"too sickly to go there; and when I grew strong again, my thoughts were"
1262,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,all occupied with an approaching event. Several changes had occurred in
1263,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the family, and others were expected, to which my friends though"
1264,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"discontented at first, had grown quite reconciled. It was not so with"
1265,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,me. There was one circumstance which affected me more than it did
1266,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"others, and from that I prophesied a continual succession of evils. It"
1267,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"seemed to me that my life was to be wholly changed, and all the joy and"
1268,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"beauty left behind. It was childish, I know. I knew it then, for I would"
1269,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,not for the world have told any one how I felt. Still I was as much
1270,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,affected by it as I have ever been since at any real grief.
1271,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1272,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"Late one afternoon, when my thoughts were busy with my fears, I went to"
1273,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"the window, and looked up at the woods. The sunshine was very bright on"
1274,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"their tops, and the shadow very dark on the hill-side below. Very"
1275,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,vividly then came back to me the memory of my visit to them the year
1276,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"before. I thought of the evils which I expected to meet, and of the"
1277,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,beauty which I found there. It was some good angel which whispered then
1278,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"in my thoughts, that, just as I went to the woods, full of fears and"
1279,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"forebodings, I was approaching the expected misfortune; that I might be"
1280,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,as happily disappointed in this as I had been in that.
1281,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1282,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"I cannot tell how delighted I was with this suggestion, nor how"
1283,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,completely it took possession of my mind. I was gloomy and fearful no
1284,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"longer. I did not, indeed, when the change came, resign what I lost by"
1285,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"it without regret; but I was so certain of finding new enjoyments, that"
1286,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"I resigned it cheerfully. And when, after a few weeks' experience had"
1287,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,taught me that many advantages and many pleasures had come to me in
1288,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"consequence of those very circumstances which I had dreaded so much, I"
1289,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,bound the lesson of the woods to my heart so firmly that there it still
1290,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,remains.
1291,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1292,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"And let me say to you, for whom I have related this little incident of"
1293,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,my childhood:--do not tremble at the disappointments and trials which
1294,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,await you. Do not seek to throw upon others any part of them which you
1295,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,may more becomingly bear yourself. If you live always in the open
1296,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"sunshine, you will never know what beauty there is in the woods. You"
1297,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"will find the sentiment in your books, that it is the night-time only"
1298,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,that shows us the stars; and in the gloom which must sometimes fall upon
1299,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"this uncertain and mortal life of ours, you may find, if you will, as"
1300,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"much to rejoice in as to dread. You will form plans, and indulge in"
1301,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"hopes, which cannot be realized, and disappointment will look frowningly"
1302,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,upon you; but if you will submit yourself to the trial like a little
1303,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"child, the hand that will lead you through it will point you to happier"
1304,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,scenes than those of your own imagining.
1305,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1306,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"You will have friends to love, that death may take away from you--and,"
1307,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"oh! then, the shadow of the woodland, as it lies against the sunny"
1308,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"meadow, will be less dark than your life. But do not despair. The few"
1309,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"rays of light that reach you will be richer, the flowers will be purer,"
1310,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,and the music will be softer and sweeter; for you will be nearer heaven
1311,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,than you were before.
1312,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,
1313,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"There is another shadow which you and I, and all of us, are"
1314,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"approaching,--""the shadow of death."" But will not ""the lesson"" brighten"
1315,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"our approach even to that? Certain I am, that if _that_ hour of my"
1316,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"childhood, when, with a fearful heart, I went into the solemn woods, and"
1317,BY MISS LOUISA M. BARKER.,"heard the sweet singing of the bird and the breeze, shall be remembered"

1412,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1413,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"In the picture opposite, the reader will see represented a part of the"
1414,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"city of Shechem, at the foot of Mount Gerizim. It is a very noted place"
1415,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"in history. It is called Sychar in the Gospel, John 4:5. It was here, at"
1416,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Jacob's well, that Jesus met the woman of Samaria. The account of the"
1417,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,conversation which they held together is one of the most interesting
1418,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,records in the New Testament. I wish all our young readers would make
1419,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,themselves acquainted with it. Jesus was a Jew; and the Jews had no
1420,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,dealings with the Samaritans. Weary with travelling in the heat of the
1421,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"day, our Lord sat down to rest by that ancient well, when the stranger"
1422,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"woman came to draw water from it. Jesus said unto her, ""Give me to"
1423,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"drink."" She was surprised that he, being a Jew, should ask water of her,"
1424,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,a Samaritan. This very surprise which she expressed led to a most
1425,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"instructive conversation. Read it, and see how plainly Jesus teaches us"
1426,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,the nature of true worship. The Jews had their temple at Jerusalem; the
1427,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Samaritans had theirs on Mount Gerizim. The woman said to Jesus, ""Our"
1428,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that Jerusalem is the"
1429,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"place where men ought to worship."" She would ask which was the true"
1430,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"place. Jesus declared to her that it was not so much the place, as it"
1431,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"was the heart, which made worship what it should be. Read the answer of"
1432,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Jesus as the New Testament gives it, and then see if the Quaker poet,"
1433,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Barton, has not beautifully expressed it thus:"

1444,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1445,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,Through the knowledge of Christ obtained by the Samaritan woman in this
1446,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"conversation, many of her sect were induced to believe on him."
1447,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1448,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"Shechem, or Sichem, is a very ancient place; though we do not find it"
1449,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"mentioned as a city until the time of Jacob, who purchased a piece of"
1450,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"land, and dug the well of which we have just spoken. The city lay"
1451,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,between the two mountains Ebal and Gerizim. It was made a city of
1452,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"refuge. Joshua 20: 7. 21. 20, 21. Quite a number of events mentioned in"
1453,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,the Old Testament occurred here. It was at Shechem Joshua met the
1454,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,assembled people for the last time. It was here that Rehoboam was made
1455,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"king, and the ten tribes rebelled."
1456,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1457,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,In after time Shechem became the chief seat of the people who
1458,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,thenceforth bore the name of Samaritans. They were made up in part of
1459,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,emigrants from other eastern nations. When the Jews returned from their
1460,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"long captivity in Babylon, and began to rebuild Jerusalem and their"
1461,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"temple, the Samaritans desired to aid them in their work. ""Let us build"
1462,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"with you,"" was their request. The Jews refused to admit them to this"
1463,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,privilege; hence a strong hatred between the two sects arose. The
1464,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,Samaritans erected their temple on Mount Gerizim.
1465,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1466,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,Shechem received the new name of Neapolis from the Greeks--a name which
1467,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"it retains to the present day. The city has passed through many changes,"
1468,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"which, had we time to recount them, might be of deep interest to the"
1469,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,reader. But it would take a larger space to do this than we can now
1470,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"occupy. The Samaritans are still here; but their number now is small,"
1471,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"not exceeding one hundred and fifty. They have a synagogue, where they"
1472,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"preserve several ancient copies of the books of Moses, and among them"
1473,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,one ancient manuscript which they believe to be three thousand four
1474,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"hundred and sixty-five years old, saying it was written by Abishua, the"
1475,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"son of Phinehas (1 Chron. 6: 3, 4.) The manuscript, so travellers who"
1476,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"have seen it say, is very ancient; but they do not all think it so old"
1477,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,as the Samaritans pretend it is.
1478,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,
1479,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,Mount Gerizim is still held in great veneration by the Samaritans. Four
1480,BY REV. J.G. ADAMS.,"times a year they ascend it in solemn procession, to worship. The old"

1504,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"living child in two, leaving life's purple current to spout forth from"

1508,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"too solemn to be trifled with, and too important to be neglected,--to"
1509,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,illustrate this by deeds which bear joy to the joyless and hope to the

1511,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"now called to perform. Will it need the voice of duty, which speaketh as"
1512,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"from the skies? This is the great truth, also, which, with all its"
1513,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"relations to life and duty, is to be impressed by the present, upon the"
1514,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"minds of the rising, generation. This is what my young readers are to"
1515,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"learn,--and not simply to learn, but to practise:--that we are all"
1516,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"brothers and sisters, no matter in what clime or country we may have"
1517,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"been born, or with what complexion we may be clothed."

1521,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"pious parents and earnest Sabbath school teachers had she been taught,"
1522,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"that to be like Jesus, who took little children in his arms and blessed"
1523,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"them, she must love and do good unto all, as brothers and sisters. This"
1524,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"had sunk deep into her young and tender mind; and when, on a visit at"
1525,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"the house of a friend, she was asked that familiar question, which is so"
1526,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"often put to children,--whom she loved,--"
1527,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,
1528,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"After a moment's hesitation she replied, that she loved everybody."

1534,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"can that be possible?"" Looking up with a countenance in which all"
1535,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"heaven's innocence and purity were mirrored, she exclaimed, ""Is not God"
1536,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,our Father? and are we not all brothers and sisters? and should we not

1538,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,
1539,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,There was no further argument to be used. Though hid from many wise and
1540,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"prudent, yet the truth was thus revealed to babes."

1542,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"Yes, we _are_ all brethren and sisters, having a common origin, a common"

1545,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"poor, unfortunate man, with torn and filthy garments, and perhaps"
1546,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"intoxicated, reeling through the streets, do not hoot after, and throw"

1550,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"When one of your number abuses the rest, and you are tempted to injure"

1558,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,"principle, how different would be the aspect of affairs from what it"
1559,BY REV. W.R.G. MELLEN.,now is! Then the kingdom of God would dawn upon us. Then the wolf and

1582,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1583,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Excuse me, girls, if I do not go with you. I do not think it"

1587,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,

1594,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1595,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. If it is only for amusement, I think we can find others far"
1596,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"more rational and innocent. But depend upon it, girls, you would not"
1597,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"wish to go, if there were not in your minds a little of credulous"

1599,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1600,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Well, I am sure I am not credulous."
1601,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1602,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Do not be offended, Sophronia; I only meant that we are all"
1603,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,of us more inclined to believe these things than we at first imagine.
1604,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1605,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Sarah_. I think that Mary Ann is right in this respect. I am sure I
1606,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,would not go if I did not think her predictions would come to pass.
1607,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1608,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Mary Ann_. Certainly; I could not suppose you would spend your time and
1609,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,money to hear an old woman tell you things you did not believe.
1610,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1611,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Eveline_. Well, I am sure I do not see any harm in having a little fun"
1612,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,once in a while.
1613,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1614,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Sophronia_. No; and I think it is very unkind in Mary Ann to spoil all
1615,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,our pleasures with her whims. She is always preaching to us about giving
1616,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"up our own way for the comfort of others, and I think she ought to give"
1617,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"up now, and go with us."
1618,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1619,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sarah_. Now, really, Sophronia, I think you are the one that is unkind."
1620,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"If Mary Ann is wrong, it is better to convince her of it kindly, and I"
1621,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,am sure she will acknowledge it.
1622,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1623,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Mary Ann_. I hope I should be willing to give up a mere whim for the
1624,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,pleasure of those I love so well. But this is not a whim; it is a
1625,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,serious conviction of duty.
1626,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1627,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Well, I thought you always pretended to be very obliging."
1628,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1629,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Mary Ann_. I have no right to be obliging at the expense of what I deem
1630,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"duty. Our own inclinations we should often sacrifice, our prejudices"
1631,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"always, but our sense of duty never."
1632,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1633,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Eveline_. I think, girls, we have done wrong to urge Mary Ann to go,"
1634,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,after she had told us her reasons.
1635,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1636,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Well, then, don't spend any more time in urging her to go,"
1637,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"against her will. You know the old proverb ""The least said is soonest"
1638,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"mended."""
1639,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1640,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Eveline_. Well, do not let us go away angry or ill-natured. You asked"
1641,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"Mary Ann to say why she thought it was wrong, and we should receive her"
1642,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,reasons kindly.
1643,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1644,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Sarah_. So I think; but I wish she would tell us what harm she thinks
1645,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,it would do to go.
1646,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1647,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Well, girls, I think, by trying to look into the future, we"
1648,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"are apt to grow discontented and restless, and to forget that we have"
1649,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"duties to perform in the present. Then, if we do not believe in it, it"
1650,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"is a waste of time and money, which might be better employed in"
1651,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,relieving the suffering of the poor around us. But the greatest evil of
1652,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"all is, that we should believe even a part; she would of course tell us"
1653,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,many little circumstances which would be true of any one; thus we might
1654,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,be led to believe all she said; the prediction would probably work out
1655,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"its own fulfilment, and perhaps render us miserable for life."
1656,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1657,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Oh, fudge! Mary Ann. This is altogether too bad and"
1658,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"ungenerous in you. In the first place, the few cents we give, bestowed"
1659,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"as they are on a poor old widow woman, are not wasted, in my opinion,"
1660,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"but well spent;--and if I spend an evening, granted to me by my father"
1661,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"and mother for recreation, in listening to Old Kate, it is no more"
1662,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,wasted than if I spend it with the girls in any other social way. And
1663,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"when you connect fortune-telling and our duties in the present, you make"
1664,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"it too serious an affair. _Remember, this is all for sport_."
1665,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1666,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. It may be so with you, Sophronia; but there are those who"
1667,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"seriously believe every word of a fortune-teller, and actually live more"
1668,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"in the unseen but expected events of the future, than in faithfully"
1669,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"performing their duties in the present. This is true, Sophronia. The"
1670,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"contentment and peace of many young minds have been utterly lost, _sold_"
1671,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"for the absurd jabbering of old, ignorant, low-bred women, who pretend"
1672,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"to read the future. [_In a livelier tone of voice_.] But just say,"
1673,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"girls, do you believe there is any connection between tea-leaves and"
1674,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,your future lives?
1675,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1676,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Eveline, Sarah, Sophronia_. Why, no!"
1677,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1678,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Mary Ann_. Do you believe God has marked the fortunes of thousands of
1679,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,his creatures on the face of cards?
1680,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1681,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Eveline, Sarah, Sophronia_. Certainly not."
1682,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1683,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Well, do you believe, if God should intrust the secret"
1684,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"events of the future with any of our race, in this age, it would be with"
1685,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"those who have neither intellectual, moral, nor religious education--who"
1686,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,can be bribed by dollars and cents to say anything?
1687,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1688,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sarah, Eveline_. No, indeed!"
1689,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1690,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann. (Turns to Sophronia,)_ You do not answer, Sophronia. Let me"
1691,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,ask you one or two more questions. Do you suppose Kate Merrill believes
1692,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,that she has a revelation from God?
1693,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1694,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. No, Mary Ann."
1695,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1696,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Mary Ann_. Do you suppose she thinks you believe so?
1697,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1698,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Why, yes, I do."
1699,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1700,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Then, is it benevolent to bestow money to encourage an old"
1701,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,woman in telling for truth what she knows to be false?
1702,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1703,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,_Sophronia_. I doubt whether it is really benevolent.
1704,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1705,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. And if Old Kate speaks falsely and knows she does so, and"
1706,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"you know it, yet spend your time in listening to what she has to say,"
1707,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,what good can come of it to head or heart?
1708,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1709,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. None at all, Mary Ann. It is time wasted, and I am"
1710,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"convinced that I have been doubly wrong in wishing to go, and in being"
1711,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,angry with you. Will you forgive me?
1712,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1713,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Mary Ann_. Certainly, Sophronia. And now, if you wish for amusement, I"

1715,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,
1716,BY JULIA A. FLETCHER.,"_Sophronia_. Oh, do tell mine; and be sure you tell it truly. What lines"

1759,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"occurred which I shall probably never forget, and which, no doubt, has"
1760,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,had some little influence on my life at many different periods since. I
1761,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,will relate it; and I wish all my young readers would remember the
1762,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,story.
1763,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1764,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"My father was somewhat poor. He had no salary for preaching, except for"
1765,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"a few months, perhaps not five hundred dollars for forty years of pulpit"
1766,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"labor. He maintained his family chiefly from a small farm, and, there"
1767,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"being several children, we were deprived of many little things that"
1768,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,wealthier parents are accustomed to furnish for theirs. We had few
1769,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"presents, and those chiefly of necessary articles,--school-books, or"
1770,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"something of the kind; while toys, playthings, and instruments of"
1771,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"amusement, we were left to go without, or take up with such rude and"
1772,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,simple ones as we could manufacture for ourselves.
1773,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1774,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"I wanted a small box very much. A handsome little trunk, such as most of"
1775,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"my young readers probably have, was too much to hope for, and a plain"
1776,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"wooden box, even, I had no means to purchase."
1777,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1778,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"I went without for a long time, and at last determined that I would try"
1779,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"to make one. But the materials,--where was I to obtain them? True, my"
1780,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"father had pieces of thin boards that would answer, but there were"
1781,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"nails, and hinges, and a lock wanting. Where were these to come from?"
1782,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1783,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"After trying a variety of methods, I invented a plan for fastening it"
1784,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"without a lock, and leather made a very good substitute for hinges, as"
1785,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"it was to be out of sight. Still, I wanted nails. There were some old"

1791,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"workmen were using, with a longing eye. O, how I coveted them!"
1792,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1793,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,The temptation was too great. I sought the opportunity while the hands
1794,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"were at dinner, and, after cautiously looking about to see that no one"
1795,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"was near to observe me, with trembling hands seized upon them, _and"
1796,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,stole enough to make my box_. O! how my heart beat as I hurried away
1797,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,across the fields home. I almost expected to see some one start up from
1798,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"every stump and bush on the way, to accuse me of the theft. I hardly"
1799,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"dared to look behind me. It seemed as though my old uncle, with frowning"
1800,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"brow, was at my very heels. And then, too, the workmen;--were they not"
1801,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"suspicious from my hanging about them, and had not some of them watched"
1802,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,me? So horrid images began to dance about my brain. Dim visions of
1803,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"court-rooms, and lawyers, and judges, and prisons, and sorrowing"
1804,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"parents, and frightened brothers and sisters, rose in awful terror"
1805,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"before me. I began to grow dizzy and faint. I had laid up, for a long"
1806,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"time, all the pennies I could obtain, which, at that time, amounted to"
1807,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"the vast sum of twenty cents, contained in an old-fashioned pistareen;"
1808,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"and the hope sprung up in my heart, that, possibly, by paying this to"
1809,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"the officers, they would not carry me to jail."
1810,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1811,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"Thought was busy in laying plans for escape, and I reached home in the"
1812,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,greatest excitement imaginable.
1813,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1814,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"Well, the deed was now done, and I could not undo it. I was really a"
1815,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"thief; and now, as I had got the nails, I thought I might as well use"
1816,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"them. I was too anxious about the crime, however, to do this at once."
1817,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"So I hid them away for a week or more, before I ventured to make my box."
1818,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1819,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"Taking such leisure hours as I had,--for I was obliged to work most of"
1820,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"the time on the farm,--I crept away in the loft of an old building, and"
1821,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"finally succeeded in finishing my task. But, now that the box was done,"
1822,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,my troubles were by no means ended. It would be seen. I could not always
1823,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"keep it out of sight. My brothers, and sisters, and playmates, would"
1824,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"examine it, and possibly my father would get his eye upon it! Suppose he"
1825,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"should, and ask me where those nails came from?"
1826,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1827,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"O, how my poor brain was racked to invent some false story by which I"
1828,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,could escape detection! I thought of saying that they were old ones
1829,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"which I had polished up so as to appear new, and I even filed down the"
1830,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,rust on the head of an old nail to see if they would look sufficiently
1831,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"alike. But nothing of this kind would answer. The cheat, I thought,"
1832,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"would be detected; and so I was obliged, after all my trouble and"
1833,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"suffering, to keep my box hidden away when it was done. Every time I"
1834,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"went to look at it, those bright new nail-heads were staring out at me,"
1835,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,ready to reveal my crime to any one who saw them.
1836,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1837,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"For a long time, I did not dare to go to my uncles again. True, he knew"
1838,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"nothing of my wrong; but I felt guilty, and did not care to see him."
1839,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"Finally, after some time had passed away, though I had by no means"
1840,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"forgotten the theft, and still suffered much every time it was thought"
1841,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"of, I ventured to call and see him. I could hardly avoid the impression"
1842,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"that he must know what I had done, and would accuse me of it; and when"
1843,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"he met me in the yard at his door; patted my cheek with a half-laughing,"
1844,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,half-reproving look; asked why I had stayed away from him so long; and
1845,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"said, that, to punish me, he should go and get me some very nice apples"
1846,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,from the garden;--I could bear it no longer. It seemed as though my
1847,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"heart would break. What I said, I have now forgotten. I remember that I"
1848,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"cried very heartily, and, as soon as my tears would allow it, told him"
1849,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,the whole story!
1850,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1851,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"I can still see, fresh in my memory, the sad look that came over him as"
1852,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,I confessed my crime; but not a single harsh or unkind word did he
1853,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,utter. He told me that it was very wrong; that I had acted nobly in
1854,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"confessing it; and that, if I had only asked him in the first place, he"
1855,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,would gladly have given me all I wanted.
1856,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1857,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"Thinking I had suffered enough already, he promised not to tell my"
1858,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"parents, in case I continued a good boy, and advised me to destroy the"
1859,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"box and bring him back the nails, as no one could then suspect what had"
1860,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,been done but ourselves.
1861,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1862,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"His kindness, I confess, pained me very much. I think nothing could have"
1863,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,tempted me to do him any wrong again.
1864,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,
1865,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,I loved him better than ever before. He never alluded to the subject
1866,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"afterwards, but I always thought of it when I saw him. He died in a"
1867,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"short time; and, twenty years after, as I stood by his grave, the"
1868,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"circumstance came up, clear and distinct, to my recollection. I have"
1869,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"not, indeed, from that to the present hour, felt the least temptation to"
1870,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"commit any wrong of the kind without recalling it; and, if all my young"
1871,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"readers will think seriously how much suffering that one act cost me,"
1872,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,"and how much happier I should otherwise have been, I am confident that"
1873,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,they will never commit a similar offence so long as they remember the
1874,BY REV. MOSES BALLOU.,story of _the boy who stole the nails_.

1882,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1883,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1884,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,There are many childless mothers in our land. In some homes there never
1885,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,lived a little child to make them happy; but in others the spirits of
1886,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"the little ones have departed. They dwell in another home--the ""dear"
1887,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"heavenly home."" Their mothers, those childless mothers, weep day and"
1888,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,night in their loneliness and sadness. This sketch is of a mother who
1889,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,had buried all her little babes--four precious children--all her little
1890,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,family. The mother's name was Ellen Moore.
1891,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1892,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"For many months after the birth of her first child, Ellen was free from"
1893,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,sorrow as a bird in the morning. She never thought affliction might come
1894,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"to her blessed home. It was not surprising, for she had never known what"
1895,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,bereavement and bitter disappointment were. She was educated to be a
1896,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"child of sunshine. She had always lived amid smiles and tenderness, and"
1897,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"when the fearful cloud of sorrow broke, in an unexpected moment, upon"
1898,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"her head, she seemed bowed down, never to rise again in health and"
1899,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,beauty.
1900,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1901,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,It was a sad day in our neighborhood when Ellen's first little babe
1902,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"died; we all wept. Not so much because he was dead, for we all felt that"
1903,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"_he_ was at rest; but his dear mother was so sorely troubled, her heart"
1904,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"ached so grievously, it seemed as if she too would die. Days and nights"
1905,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"Ellen wept, and moaned, and walked her house. The tears seemed to burn"
1906,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"their way down her cheeks. She spoke but seldom, yet that pitiful moan"
1907,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,she so often breathed out pierced our souls and made us all very sad.
1908,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1909,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"After a few weeks, the consolation we offered her quieted her feelings,"
1910,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"and she became calm. She went to church, called on her friends, and"
1911,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,attended to her duties at home. But there was ever a sadness in her
1912,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"voice and manners. Her home was so lonely, so strangely still and"
1913,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"vacant, and Ellen so silent, that the voice of gladness was not heard in"
1914,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,it again until a second beautiful boy was born under its roof.
1915,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1916,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,We were all happy then. Even Ellen smiled as she kissed her dear
1917,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"babe--but a tear followed the smile and the kiss so soon, we knew her"
1918,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"wounded heart was not _then_ healed. She was very sad, and felt that"
1919,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"this babe, too, might only be loaned her for a short time. It was not"
1920,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"long before we all felt so. That little face, so pale, so sad, so"
1921,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"beautiful, evidently bore the seal of death upon it. He refused all"
1922,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"nourishment, and pined slowly away. Ellen knew he must die, but could"
1923,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,not say so. She could not shed one tear to relieve her sorrowful heart.
1924,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"She neither spoke nor wept, until her infant was laid in its coffin."
1925,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1926,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"A friend had woven a wreath of beautiful flowers, and laid it on the"
1927,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"satin pillow of the coffin, and placed a delicate rose-bud in the little"
1928,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"hand of the babe. Ellen went alone to take her last kiss, when, seeing"
1929,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"her babe so beautiful in death, she seated herself on the floor and wept"
1930,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,freely.
1931,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1932,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"""Who loved my babe so fondly?"" said she, when she came from the room."
1933,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"""Who has been so kind and thoughtful of me? It has unsealed my tears;"
1934,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"now let me weep alone."" We left her. She came out of that room a changed"
1935,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"woman. She assisted us in our preparations for the burial of the dead,"
1936,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"spoke cheerfully to her husband, conversed freely about her children in"
1937,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"heaven, and remarked that henceforth her life should be worthy of a"
1938,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"Christian. We buried the sweet babe by the side of his brother, and"
1939,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"planted a rose-tree over his grave. Then our thoughts turned to Ellen,"
1940,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,whose whole manner indicated resignation and peace.
1941,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1942,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"We were not surprised at the effect of grief upon Ellen, for I have told"
1943,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,you she was not educated to bear human misery with much composure. Yet
1944,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,what her parents had left undone seemed to be effected by those severe
1945,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,dispensations of God. Our Father in heaven often educates us by his
1946,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"chastisements, giving us wisdom, patience, hope, trustfulness and"
1947,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"resignation, according to the severity with which he afflicts us."
1948,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1949,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,Ellen maintained the same cheerful manner from the time of the burial of
1950,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,her second babe to the birth of her third child. Her friends hoped many
1951,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"blessings for Ellen in the life of this child. It was a daughter,"
1952,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,apparently healthy; and as its mother had endured so severe a trial we
1953,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,hoped the Lord would deal mercifully with her in sparing this one to
1954,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,her. For one short year we had reason to hope for the life of the child.
1955,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"But it was too frail a creature for this world, and, like its little"
1956,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"brothers, died in early infancy. And its mother--we found her to be a"
1957,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,practical Christian indeed.
1958,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1959,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"Instead of moaning and violent grief, she held her babe as it breathed"
1960,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"its latest breath, and was first to break the awful silence in the room"
1961,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"that succeeded the final struggle, with these words: ""She is with her"
1962,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"little brothers now, and I have reason to bless the Lord."" She could say"
1963,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,no more then; and a few large tears fell on the cheek of her babe as it
1964,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,still lay on her lap. Once only did she freely yield to tears. It was
1965,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,when her husband first heard of the death of his babe. His anguish
1966,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"overcame her composure. Soon recovered however, she maintained a truly"
1967,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,Christian deportment. The third little grave was opened in the burial
1968,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"lot of Mr. Moore, and the body of this babe laid by its little brothers."
1969,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1970,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"A fourth babe was born in the lonely home of Ellen, and fresh hopes"
1971,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,cherished for the long life of her child. The burden of every prayer
1972,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"offered at that family altar was, ""Lord, if it be thy will, suffer us to"
1973,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"rear this tender child!"""
1974,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1975,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"""Yet though I pray thus,"" said Ellen, ""my heart is strong to meet its"

1977,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"has afflicted me, but I am profited thereby."""
1978,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,
1979,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"""Very true, Ellen, but if this fourth dear babe is taken from us, we"

1981,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"delicate health, endure to lay this last dear babe by the side of the"
1982,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"departed ones, and again find your home desolate and silent?"""

1984,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"""My body is weak, Mary, but my spirit is well instructed in resignation,"
1985,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,and can calmly bear whatever new affliction God pleases to send. You
1986,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"have called me changed since Alfred died, and sometimes too silent and"
1987,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"sad. I am changed and often silent, but not sad. _My_ treasures are in"
1988,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"heaven, and my communings are more with the spirits of my children in"
1989,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,heaven than with the friends who are with me here. And if this child
1990,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"dies, Mary,----if he dies--his death will prepare me for the duties of"

2000,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"But Ellen--believe me, she was transformed from a child of sunshine to"
2001,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,an angel and minister of light in darkness. She sat by her husband as
2002,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,serene and collected as if her babe only slept; not a tear swept her
2003,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"cheek, not a tremulous word fell from her lips, as she soothed her"

2005,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,directed every funeral preparation with as much composure as if _her_
2006,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"heart had not felt the awful wound. The world called her heartless,--but"
2007,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"Christ must have owned her as one of his brightest jewels, almost a"
2008,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"perfect disciple. When she spoke, we felt as if some mysterious power"
2009,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,from heaven was in our midst. We thought as much of the saint-like
2010,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"fortitude and resignation of our feeble Ellen, and wept as much to"
2011,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"witness her calmness and spiritual strength, as for the loss of our"

2151,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"countenance, that indicated a mournful recollection of that dear mother."
2152,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,Through his whole life he felt that he was like a tender branch lopped

2154,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,to meet the storms and travel the dangerous paths of which he often
2155,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"heard from his mother. This idea seemed ever present, and served many"

2162,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,vivid as might have been expected from a child bereaved at the age of
2163,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"eight or ten. When older, he realized more fully his loss, especially"
2164,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,when he met one whom he believed to be _a good mother._ He then seldom
2165,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"spoke of his mother; but his visits to the grave-yard, his sadness on"
2166,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"the anniversary of the day of her death, his conversations about her"
2167,BY MRS. M.H. ADAMS.,"with his brothers and sister, the value he attached to every token of"

2315,SELECTED.,"Mount Carmel is a high promontory, forming the termination of a range of"
2316,SELECTED.,hills running northwest from the plain of Esdraelon. Mount Carmel is the
2317,SELECTED.,"southern boundary of the Bay of Acre, on Acca, as it is called by the"
2318,SELECTED.,"Turks; its height is about fifteen hundred feet, and at its foot, north,"
2319,SELECTED.,"runs the brook Kishon, and a little further north the river Belus."
2320,SELECTED.,
2321,SELECTED.,Mount Carmel is celebrated in Scripture history as the place where
2322,SELECTED.,Elijah went up when he told his servant to look forth to the sea yet
2323,SELECTED.,"seven times, and the seventh time he saw a little cloud coming up from"
2324,SELECTED.,"the sea ""like a man's hand,"" when the prophet knew that the promised"
2325,SELECTED.,"rain was at hand, and girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab's chariot"
2326,SELECTED.,even to the gates of Jezreel. (1 Kings xviii. 44-46.)
2327,SELECTED.,
2328,SELECTED.,"Towards the sea is a cave, where it has been supposed that Elijah"
2329,SELECTED.,"desired Ahab to bring Baal's false prophets, and where fire from heaven"
2330,SELECTED.,descended on the altar he erected. The present appearance of Carmel is
2331,SELECTED.,"thus described by Dr. Hogg, who visited it in 1833. ""The convent on"
2332,SELECTED.,Mount Carmel was destroyed by the Turks in the early part of the Greek
2333,SELECTED.,"revolution. Abdallah, the Turkish pasha, who commanded the district in"
2334,SELECTED.,"which Carmel is situated, not only razed their convent to the ground,"
2335,SELECTED.,"but blew up the foundations, and carried the materials to Acre for his"
2336,SELECTED.,"own use. The convent is now being rebuilt, or probably is now completely"
2337,SELECTED.,"finished, the funds having been supplied by subscriptions solicited all"
2338,SELECTED.,"over Europe, and a great part of the East, by one of the brethren,"
2339,SELECTED.,"Giovanni Battista, who has travelled far and wide for that purpose."" Dr."
2340,SELECTED.,Hogg gives the following account of the condition of the place at the
2341,SELECTED.,time of his visit.
2342,SELECTED.,
2343,SELECTED.,"""The whole fabric is of stone, and, when completed, will possess the"
2344,SELECTED.,"solidity of a fortress. The first story only is at present finished, and"
2345,SELECTED.,hereafter will be solely appropriated to the accommodation of
2346,SELECTED.,"travellers, when another, to be raised above, will be exclusively"
2347,SELECTED.,devoted to permanent inmates. In the centre a spacious church has been
2348,SELECTED.,"commenced, and already promises to be a fine building. The principal"
2349,SELECTED.,altar will be placed over the cave so long held sacred as the retreat of
2350,SELECTED.,the prophet. This natural cavern exhibits at its farther extremity some
2351,SELECTED.,signs of having been enlarged by art. When the edifice above is
2352,SELECTED.,"complete, it will be converted into a chapel; and a projecting ledge of"
2353,SELECTED.,"rock, believed to have been the sleeping-place of the prophet, will then"
2354,SELECTED.,be the altar. The superior himself kindly conducted me to see one of the
2355,SELECTED.,celebrated caves which everywhere abound in the district of Mount
2356,SELECTED.,"Carmel. Descending two thirds of the mountain by a narrow path, scooped"
2357,SELECTED.,"in the rock, we entered an enclosure of fig-trees and vines, where"
2358,SELECTED.,"several caverns, that of old belonged to the Carmelites, are now"

2391,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"feeling in my throat all this afternoon, and though I winked and"
2392,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"swallowed with all my might, the tears would come in spite of myself."
2393,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Here I've been wandering for more than three hours, up hill and down,"
2394,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"through brambles and brier-bushes; my hands are scratched and bloody,"
2395,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,and the sun has burnt me as brown as a berry. Three long precious hours
2396,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"in the sunny month of August! and what does it all amount to? Why, I"
2397,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,have picked a basket of berries that can be eaten in half an hour; and
2398,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"here is a bunch of flowers for little Katie, that she will take and"

2400,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"isn't the worst of all; no, not by a great deal; there is a great rent"

2409,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2410,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,It was not long before she was roused by the sound of footsteps; she
2411,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"raised her head, and saw an old woman coming down the road with a large"
2412,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"basket on her arm. She looked tired and weary, as well she might be, for"
2413,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"she had travelled a long distance; it was a hot, sultry afternoon, and"
2414,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,every footstep stirred a cloud of dust. She came towards the spring; but

2432,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"always hung by the spring, after having satisfied her thirst, ""what is"
2433,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,it troubles you? Such sorrowful eyes and a tearful face belong only to
2434,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"older heads and more sinful hearts; and God forbid it even to them,"
2435,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,unless it is wrung out of the agony of their very souls; for though his

2438,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Oh,"" she replied, as the tears filled her eyes again, ""I have been"

2440,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2441,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Well-a-day!"" said the old woman, looking rather droll; ""it's very"
2442,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,strange such a young creature as you should come down here to weep on

2444,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"a runaway from the house of correction."""
2445,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2446,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,Annie could not help laughing at such an idea; but as the smile passed
2447,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"away, the troubled waters of her heart seemed to burst forth in a"
2448,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"flood, and she wept violently."
2449,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2450,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Ah,"" said the old woman, shaking her head sorrowfully: ""I ought not to"
2451,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,have spoken thus; I see how it is. Poor lamb! she hears the voice of the
2452,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Shepherd calling her, but she is bewildered and knows not the way to the"
2453,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"fold; and may the Lord Jesus look upon me, as he did upon his sinful"

2457,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"She sat down beside Annie and laid her arm gently around her. ""There's a"

2459,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"moist hair; ""listen to me a little while, and I will tell you what will"
2460,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"make you happier."" She took the cool waters of the spring, and bathed"
2461,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"her burning forehead, and washed away all traces of dust and tears. The"
2462,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,water had a cooling and soothing effect upon Annie's troubled brain.
2463,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2464,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""There now,"" said the good dame; ""don't you feel better?"""
2465,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2466,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Yes,"" said Annie, almost cheerfully."
2467,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2468,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Well,"" she continued, ""God's love is just like this spring; it is full"
2469,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"and free to all. Now don't you suppose, if you could cleanse and purify"
2470,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"your heart from all traces of sin and sorrow in its blessed waters, just"
2471,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"as you bathe your face in this spring, that you would feel happier and"
2472,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"better."""
2473,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2474,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Yes,"" said Annie, slowly and thoughtfully, as if a new idea was passing"
2475,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,through her mind.
2476,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2477,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Well then, I will tell you how. I have felt just as you do now. When I"
2478,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"was a girl I was a restless, idle creature; useless to others, and a"
2479,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"burden to myself. Of course I was unhappy, miserable. It was in vain"
2480,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,that I went to school with such a discontented mind. I had a harder
2481,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,lesson to learn than any that my teacher could learn me. God grant you
2482,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,may not have to learn it in the same way that I did! I learned it by
2483,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"experience; a sorrowful way that is to learn anything, although it is"
2484,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,slow and sure; you may be pretty certain that you never will forget it.
2485,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"I have found out, by experience, that the only way that we can live and"
2486,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"be happy, is by loving and serving others, just as the blessed Jesus"
2487,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"did; and if you will try it you will find it so."""
2488,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2489,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Oh,"" said Annie, ""I am a little girl. What good can I do? If I was the"
2490,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Lord Jesus, I would go about doing good; then I would cast out devils,"
2491,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"and heal the sick, and raise the dead."""
2492,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2493,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Yes, yes; I know you are yet but a 'wee thing,' and have much to learn;"
2494,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,but 'the race is not always to the swift and the battle to the strong;'
2495,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,it isn't the tallest men and the oldest heads that do the most good in
2496,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"the world. But I'll tell you what _you can_ do, if you can't work"
2497,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,miracles; though there's many a devil cast out in these days of sin and
2498,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"sorrow, that men know not of; those who struggle and strive with the"
2499,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Evil One, and thrust him out of the doors of their heart, do not sound a"
2500,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"trumpet before them in the streets, for they are true followers of the"
2501,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,dear Lamb of God. That same old spirit of selfishness that tempted Eve
2502,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"in the garden of Eden has gone through the world like a creeping, wily"
2503,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"serpent ever since. It has wound itself round and round our hearts, coil"
2504,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"upon coil, until we scarce seem to have any heart at all. It is this"
2505,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"that troubles you, and you must cast it out; you must forget your own"
2506,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"interest, and learn everybody to love you; then you can't help loving"
2507,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"everybody, and you will be happy. Oh, it will be hard, very hard, to do"
2508,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"this; you will stop, and perhaps turn back; but when it is the darkest"
2509,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"you must take the gentle hand that our dear brother, the Lord Jesus,"
2510,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"stretches out to you, and he will lead you safely to the very bosom of"
2511,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,the Father.
2512,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2513,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""But look up, dear one, the sun has gone down behind the hill, and you"
2514,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,must hasten homeward. The mother bird must needs feel anxious when her
2515,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"nestlings are away. But don't forget what I have told you."""
2516,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2517,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""No,"" said Annie, raising her head, for she had been thinking"
2518,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,earnestly; every word that her kind friend had spoken went with a
2519,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"powerful influence to her heart; ""I will _try_ and _do what I can,""_"
2520,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,said she.
2521,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2522,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Ay,"" said the old woman, ""that's right! not even an angel can do more."
2523,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"But stop,"" she added; ""do you remember what day it is?"""
2524,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2525,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Yes,"" said Annie."
2526,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2527,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Well then, just a year from this time, if the Lord permits, we will"
2528,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"meet again by this spring. Now good night, and may the blessing of the"
2529,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Great Father go with you."""
2530,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2531,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Good night,"" said Annie, and with a cheerful heart and light footstep,"
2532,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,she hastened homeward.
2533,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2534,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"No sooner did she come in sight of her home, than she perceived a horse"
2535,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,and carriage standing by the gate. She recognized it in a moment; it was
2536,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"the doctor's. A cold shudder passed over her, and an indefinable fear"
2537,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,entered her mind. She hastened onward and entered the house.
2538,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2539,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Upon the bed lay little Katie; her eyes fixed upon the wall, seemingly"
2540,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"unconscious of all that passed around her, sending forth low moans, as"
2541,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"if in great pain. Beside her sat the doctor, counting the beatings of"
2542,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"her pulse, and closely observing the alterations of her countenance."
2543,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2544,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""I cannot give you much encouragement,"" said he. ""It is a disease of"
2545,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"the brain. All shall be done for her that is possible, but I fear there"
2546,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"is not much hope."""
2547,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2548,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Alas! it was even so; all was done in vain. She laid day after day, a"
2549,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,helpless sufferer. It was long before the vital energy was spent; but
2550,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"through all this weary time, there was one constant watcher by her"
2551,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,bed-side.
2552,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2553,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Annie, with the impression of a deep truth upon her soul, felt that"
2554,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"_now_ was the time to act, and most faithfully did she perform her duty."
2555,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"And when, at last, sweet Katie died, with a warm gush of tears she laid"
2556,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,one of the flowers that she had gathered from the hill-side upon her
2557,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"bosom, and clasping her arms around her mother's neck, she said:"
2558,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Mother, dear sister is gone, and now I must be both Annie and Katie to"
2559,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"you; and if God will help me, I shall be more of a blessing to you than"
2560,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"I ever yet have been."""
2561,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2562,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Oh, it was like a ray of sunshine to that weeping mother's heart, to"
2563,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,hear her once wayward child speak thus! and though it was like taking
2564,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"away the life-drops from her heart to give up her cherished little one,"
2565,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,yet she felt there was still a great blessing remaining for her.
2566,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2567,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,Time passed on. Autumn came with its ripened fruits and golden foliage;
2568,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"winter laid his glittering mantle upon the streams and hill-tops, and"
2569,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,spring brought blossoms for little Katie's grave.
2570,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2571,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Annie, the gentle Annie, where was she?"
2572,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2573,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"Firm to her purpose, she had gone onward. At times the struggle was hard"
2574,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"indeed. Then she would go to the spring, and kneel down, and talk with"
2575,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"her Good Father, until the evil feelings had left her heart, and the"
2576,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,cheerful smile came again to her countenance.
2577,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2578,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"At length summer, bright, beautiful summer, beamed over the land once"
2579,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"more, and as it drew to a close it brought the day on which Annie was to"
2580,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,meet her friend at the spring.
2581,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2582,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"It was the close of the Sabbath, and the last rays of the setting sun"
2583,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"streamed through the branches of the trees that surrounded the spring,"
2584,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"and tinged its waters with a rosy light. There sat the old lady, looking"
2585,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,anxiously up the road.
2586,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2587,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""I wonder why she don't come,"" said she. ""Perhaps the young thing has"
2588,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"forgotten me. Sure 'twould be a sorrow to me if I thought she had."""
2589,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2590,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""No indeed,"" said a pleasant voice. A light form sprang from a clump of"
2591,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"bushes close by, and she felt a warm kiss upon her cheek. ""No, I have"
2592,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"not forgotten you, but I have come to tell you how happy I am. Oh, I"
2593,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"have seen trouble and sorrow _enough_, since I saw you; but for all"
2594,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"that, I am much happier than I was then. You told me that I must learn"
2595,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"to love everybody, and so I did; and now it seems as if everybody and"
2596,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"everything loved me, even our old cat and dog. Strange, isn't it?"""
2597,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,
2598,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""Heart's dearest!"" said the old woman, as soon as she could speak,"
2599,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,wiping away the tears from her eyes with the corner of her apron;
2600,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"""there's a philosophy in all things, even in baking bread and washing"
2601,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,dishes; but the true philosophy of life consists in loving and doing;
2602,BY MISS ELIZABETH DOTEN,"and, blessed be God! that is so plain, that the least of his children"

2683,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"scholar in a Baptist school; and I will do so, as it may give a good"
2684,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,hint to some teachers to be impartial.
2685,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,
2686,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,At the school I attended a decision was made to give a silver medal to
2687,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"the best scholar. A good many of us worked hard for it, especially the"
2688,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"boys in the round pews near the pulpit, who had reason to think that the"
2689,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,prize would fall to one of their number. A right good feeling prevailed
2690,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,amongst them; all were willing to acquiesce in whatever should be the
2691,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,decision of the superintendent or committee. When the time for decision
2692,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"came, a lad, the son of a deacon, and who had left school and had not"
2693,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"been at school for six months, was sent for, and _to him_ the silver"
2694,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"medal was given! We all felt outraged, but did not dare to say much. I"
2695,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"begged my parents, with good reasoning, to let me go to another school,"
2696,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"where I had many friends; and I went to Dr. Winchell's, in Salem street,"
2697,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,where Mr. John Gear was superintendent.
2698,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,
2699,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,What lessons I did get! Whole chapters were recited from the New
2700,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"Testament, because so many verses brought me a reward, so many rewards a"
2701,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"mark, and so many marks _a book_! We had no libraries then. Well, the"
2702,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"annual meeting came round, and one evening the school met and marched"
2703,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"down to Dr. Baldwin's church. I remember the children did the singing,"
2704,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"and while they were singing, of course, I sung; and I have not forgotten"
2705,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"how crest-fallen I felt when Mr. Gear came along, and whispered to me,"
2706,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"""Don't sing _so loud_;"" but he might just as well have said, ""Don't"
2707,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"sing,"" because I knew he did not want me to sing, for I could not keep"
2708,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"time. But it was festival-night, and he was extremely good-natured, and"
2709,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"did not wish to cut short the privileges of any. A prayer was offered,"
2710,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"and then we sung again. A big man, in a large black silk gown, got up,"
2711,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"and delivered a sermon; but we did not heed it as we ought to have done,"
2712,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,because some _tea-chests_ were ranged along at the base of the pulpit.
2713,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"It was not the _tea-chests_ that attracted our attention, but the sweets"
2714,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,that we knew were _in_ them.
2715,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,
2716,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"After the sermon was over, and the scholars were ranged in order, in"
2717,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"single file, they marched up to the table near the chests, and each one"
2718,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,received _a quarter of a sheet of gingerbread!_ How rich we were! How
2719,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"sweet the cake tasted! We were in perfect ecstasies at the ""great piece"""
2720,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"given to each of us! Such rows of happy children are seldom seen, and"
2721,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,all because two cents worth of gingerbread was given to them all alike!
2722,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"We had thought of it for weeks, and it was delightful to anticipate the"
2723,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,occasion. We felt paid for all the trouble we had met in learning
2724,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"lessons, in getting to school on rainy days, and keeping still and"
2725,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,orderly when we got there. And why all this happiness from so slight a
2726,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,cause? Because we all felt loving and happy; we loved our teachers and
2727,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,our school; and it seemed _so odd_ to get gingerbread in the church and
2728,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,from the Sabbath school superintendent.
2729,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,
2730,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"But how is it now? A long ride or sail; swings, music, cakes, pies,"
2731,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"fruit, lemonade, and a vast variety of ""good things,"" must be had, or"
2732,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"else the Sabbath school children do not have ""a good time!"" After all"
2733,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"this is had and enjoyed, I do not believe it is any better than our"
2734,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"simple quarter of a sheet of gingerbread, unless the scholars love each"
2735,BY REV. HENRY BACON.,"other more, and their schools better, than we did. Do _you_, reader?"

2743,NELLY GREY.,
2744,NELLY GREY.,"""Nelly! Nelly! Where can the child be? Nelly! Nelly!"" But Nelly Grey was"
2745,NELLY GREY.,"away off in dreamland, and the cheerful tones of her mother's voice fell"
2746,NELLY GREY.,"all unheeded upon her ear, as did the impatient touch of her little dog"
2747,NELLY GREY.,Frisk's cold nose upon her hand. She was sitting on the last step of the
2748,NELLY GREY.,"vine-covered portico in front of the cottage,--the warm June sun smiling"
2749,NELLY GREY.,"down lovingly upon her, and the soft wind kissing the little rings of"
2750,NELLY GREY.,chestnut-colored hair that clustered about her temples.
2751,NELLY GREY.,
2752,NELLY GREY.,What could make the child so quiet? It must be some weighty matter that
2753,NELLY GREY.,"would still _her_ joyous laugh. Why, she was the merriest little body"
2754,NELLY GREY.,that ever hunted for violets. There was a laugh lodged in every dimple
2755,NELLY GREY.,"of her sunny face, and her busy little tongue was all the day long"
2756,NELLY GREY.,carolling some happy ditty.
2757,NELLY GREY.,
2758,NELLY GREY.,"""Nelly, what are you dreaming about? I've been calling you this long"
2759,NELLY GREY.,"time, and here you are in this warm sun, almost asleep."""
2760,NELLY GREY.,
2761,NELLY GREY.,"""No, no! mother dear, I've only been thinking, and haven't heard you"
2762,NELLY GREY.,"call once. Only to think that you couldn't find me mother! how funny!"""
2763,NELLY GREY.,
2764,NELLY GREY.,"""And what has my little girl been thinking of?"" said Mrs. Grey, as she"
2765,NELLY GREY.,"lifted Nelly into her lap, and smoothed hack the silky curls from her"
2766,NELLY GREY.,"brow. Nelly laid her rosy cheek close to her mother's, and wound her"
2767,NELLY GREY.,"small arms about her neck, and told her simple thoughts in a low, sweet"
2768,NELLY GREY.,voice.
2769,NELLY GREY.,
2770,NELLY GREY.,"""You know it's strawberry time, mother, don't you?"""
2771,NELLY GREY.,
2772,NELLY GREY.,"""Yes, darling."""
2773,NELLY GREY.,
2774,NELLY GREY.,"""Well, I was thinking, if you would let me, I could pick a big basket"
2775,NELLY GREY.,"full, they are so thick over in our meadow; and maybe Mrs. Preston would"
2776,NELLY GREY.,"buy them of me, for she gives Mr. Jones a heap of money every year for"
2777,NELLY GREY.,"them."""
2778,NELLY GREY.,
2779,NELLY GREY.,"""And what does Nelly want of a heap of money?"""
2780,NELLY GREY.,
2781,NELLY GREY.,"""Why, mother, little Frisk wants a brass collar,--don't you, Frisk?"""
2782,NELLY GREY.,Frisk barked and played all sorts of antics to show his young mistress
2783,NELLY GREY.,"he was very much in need of one. ""Think how pretty it would be, mother,"
2784,NELLY GREY.,"round Frisk's glossy neck. Oh, say that I may--do, do, mother!"""
2785,NELLY GREY.,
2786,NELLY GREY.,"Nelly's pleading proved irresistible, and her mother tied her little"
2787,NELLY GREY.,"sunbonnet under her chin, gave the ""big basket"" into her hands, and the"
2788,NELLY GREY.,"little girl trudged merrily off, with Frisk jumping and barking by her"
2789,NELLY GREY.,side to see his young mistress so happy.
2790,NELLY GREY.,
2791,NELLY GREY.,"Shall I tell how the long summer afternoon wore away, dear little"
2792,NELLY GREY.,"reader, and how the big basket was filled to the tip-top and covered"
2793,NELLY GREY.,"with wild flowers and oak leaves? Shall I tell, or shall I leave you to"
2794,NELLY GREY.,"guess, my little bright eyes? You say, yes? Well, I will tell you about"
2795,NELLY GREY.,her walk to Mrs. Preston's after the sun had gone down and the azure
2796,NELLY GREY.,"blue sky had become changed to a soft, golden hue."
2797,NELLY GREY.,
2798,NELLY GREY.,"It was a pleasant walk under the drooping trees, and Nelly Grey,"
2799,NELLY GREY.,"swinging her basket carefully on her arm, tripped lightly on her way."
2800,NELLY GREY.,"Oh, how her blue eyes danced with joy as she looked down upon the little"
2801,NELLY GREY.,merry Frisk trotting by her side; her bright lips parted as she
2802,NELLY GREY.,"murmured, ""Yes, yes, Frisk shall have a nice new collar, with 'Nelly"
2803,NELLY GREY.,"Grey's dog, Frisk,' written upon it;"" then Frisk played all sorts of"
2804,NELLY GREY.,"funny antics again, probably by way of thanks."
2805,NELLY GREY.,
2806,NELLY GREY.,Ah! but what calls that sudden blush and smile to Nelly's face?--and she
2807,NELLY GREY.,"had well nigh stumbled, too, and spilt all her strawberries. No wonder"
2808,NELLY GREY.,"she started, for, emerging from under the shadow of the trees, was a"
2809,NELLY GREY.,"handsome lad some half a head taller than Nelly. He was gazing, too,"
2810,NELLY GREY.,"with a witching smile into her face, waiting till it should be the"
2811,NELLY GREY.,little maiden's pleasure to notice him. She nodded her pretty little
2812,NELLY GREY.,"head as demurely as a city belle, laid her small hand lovingly upon"
2813,NELLY GREY.,"Frisk's curly coat, and walked with a slower and less bounding step than"
2814,NELLY GREY.,before. But Phil Morton was not to be abashed at this; so he stepped
2815,NELLY GREY.,"lightly up to Nelly, saying,"
2816,NELLY GREY.,
2817,NELLY GREY.,"""Let me carry your basket; it is too heavy for you."""
2818,NELLY GREY.,
2819,NELLY GREY.,"The little girl, with many injunctions to be careful and not tip it"
2820,NELLY GREY.,"over, delivered the basket to him; she then told him her project of"
2821,NELLY GREY.,buying Frisk a collar with the money got by the selling of the
2822,NELLY GREY.,"strawberries, which young Phil approved of very much, and offered to go"
2823,NELLY GREY.,"with her to buy it, for he knew somebody, he said, that kept them for"
2824,NELLY GREY.,"sale. Nelly joyfully assented to his offer, and thanked him heartily,"
2825,NELLY GREY.,"too, for his kindness."
2826,NELLY GREY.,
2827,NELLY GREY.,"""There, Phil, we are almost there. I can see the long study window; we"
2828,NELLY GREY.,"have only to pass the widow Mason's cottage, up the green lane, and we"
2829,NELLY GREY.,"shall be there."""
2830,NELLY GREY.,
2831,NELLY GREY.,"On they walked, laughing merrily for very lightness of heart, till they"
2832,NELLY GREY.,were close beside the poor widow's low cottage window. Suddenly Nelly
2833,NELLY GREY.,"stopped, and the laugh was hushed upon her bright lips. ""Did you hear"
2834,NELLY GREY.,"it, Phil?"" she said softly. ""Hear what, Nell?"" and Phil turned his black"
2835,NELLY GREY.,"eyes slowly round, as if he expected to see some fairy issue from the"
2836,NELLY GREY.,"grove of trees near by. ""Why, Lucy Mason's cough. Mother says she will"
2837,NELLY GREY.,"not live to see the little snow-birds come again. Poor, dear Lucy!"" The"
2838,NELLY GREY.,"great tear-drops rolled fast over Nelly's red cheeks, and fell like rain"
2839,NELLY GREY.,"upon her little hand. ""Oh, Phil, I'll tell you what;--I'll give these"
2840,NELLY GREY.,"strawberries to Lucy. She used to love them dearly."""
2841,NELLY GREY.,
2842,NELLY GREY.,"""Poh! poh! Nelly; what a silly girl! to give them away when Mrs. Preston"
2843,NELLY GREY.,"will give you such a deal of money for them!"""
2844,NELLY GREY.,
2845,NELLY GREY.,"""But, Phil, Lucy's mother is poor; she can't buy them for her, and you"
2846,NELLY GREY.,"can't think how well Lucy loves them."""
2847,NELLY GREY.,
2848,NELLY GREY.,"""Well, what if she does, and what if she is poor? can't her mother pick"
2849,NELLY GREY.,"them over in the fields, if she wants them so bad? I wouldn't give them"
2850,NELLY GREY.,"away."""
2851,NELLY GREY.,
2852,NELLY GREY.,"""For shame, Phil Morton! To think of poor old Mrs. Mason's going over in"
2853,NELLY GREY.,"the fields to pick strawberries, leaving Lucy all alone, and so sick! I"
2854,NELLY GREY.,"shouldn't have thought it of you, Phil. No, indeed I shouldn't. Give me"
2855,NELLY GREY.,"the basket,"" said Nelly sorrowfully; ""I shall give them to Lucy."" Phil"
2856,NELLY GREY.,"silently handed the basket to her, and, without speaking, he followed"
2857,NELLY GREY.,Nelly as she went round to the cottage door.
2858,NELLY GREY.,
2859,NELLY GREY.,The tears ran silently down the poor widow's cheek as she led the
2860,NELLY GREY.,"children to her sick child's room, for it touched her heart to see young"
2861,NELLY GREY.,"and thoughtless children so attentive to her poor Lucy. ""And did you"
2862,NELLY GREY.,"come all this way, you and Phil, Nelly, to bring me these nice"
2863,NELLY GREY.,"strawberries?"" without waiting for her to reply, she turned to a little"
2864,NELLY GREY.,"choice tea-rose that stood beside her, and, breaking off two half-blown"
2865,NELLY GREY.,"buds, she gave them to Phil and Nelly, saying as she did so, ""It's all I"
2866,NELLY GREY.,"have to give you, darlings, for your kindness to me, but I know that you"
2867,NELLY GREY.,"will like them as coming from your sick friend."""
2868,NELLY GREY.,
2869,NELLY GREY.,The bright blood flashed over Phil's dark brow and crimsoned even his
2870,NELLY GREY.,ears. Poor Phil! The shame and remorse of those few minutes washed away
2871,NELLY GREY.,"his unthinking sin, and Nelly forgave him, and tried with all her power"
2872,NELLY GREY.,to make him forget it. But the kind though thoughtless boy was not
2873,NELLY GREY.,satisfied until he had sent Lucy a pretty little basket filled with rare
2874,NELLY GREY.,"and beautiful flowers, gathered from his father's large garden. Then,"
2875,NELLY GREY.,"and not till then, did he look with pleasure upon the rose Lucy had"
2876,NELLY GREY.,given him.
2877,NELLY GREY.,
2878,NELLY GREY.,"Some time after the above occurrence, perhaps a week, Nelly was sitting"
2879,NELLY GREY.,"in her low rocking-chair, under the shadow of the portico, sewing as"
2880,NELLY GREY.,"busily as her nimble little fingers would let her, when a shadow"
2881,NELLY GREY.,"darkened the sunlit walk leading to the house. Nelly saw it, and knew"
2882,NELLY GREY.,"well enough who it was; but there she sat, her pretty little mouth"
2883,NELLY GREY.,"pursed up, and her merry blue eyes almost closed, working faster than"
2884,NELLY GREY.,ever.
2885,NELLY GREY.,
2886,NELLY GREY.,"""Oh! is it you, Phil?"" she exclaimed, as Phil Morton bounded lightly"
2887,NELLY GREY.,"over the railing beside her, (for he disdained the sober process of"
2888,NELLY GREY.,"walking up the steps;) ""how you frightened me!"" _He_ frighten _her!_"
2889,NELLY GREY.,"Though he was naughty sometimes, and scared the little birds, he would"
2890,NELLY GREY.,"not think of frightening Nelly Grey. No, not he."
2891,NELLY GREY.,
2892,NELLY GREY.,"""Oh! Phil, I have something to show you,"" said the little girl, after a"
2893,NELLY GREY.,"while, and then she raised her voice and called, ""Frisk! Frisk!"" Frisk"
2894,NELLY GREY.,"was not far away from Nelly, and presently he came lazily along, shaking"
2895,NELLY GREY.,his silky coat as if he did not quite relish being waked from his nap so
2896,NELLY GREY.,abruptly.
2897,NELLY GREY.,
2898,NELLY GREY.,"""But what is that shining so brightly around his neck--can it be a"
2899,NELLY GREY.,"collar? Well, it is, sure enough. But where _did_ you get it, Nell?"""
2900,NELLY GREY.,"said Phil, turning to her in amazement."
2901,NELLY GREY.,
2902,NELLY GREY.,"""Mrs. Preston, the minister's wife, gave it to me; how she came to know"
2903,NELLY GREY.,"I wanted it, I can't think."""
2904,NELLY GREY.,
2905,NELLY GREY.,"""But I can, Nell. She heard us when we were talking, I'll bet; for you"
2906,NELLY GREY.,"know she came in just after we did, and she gave it to you for being so"
2907,NELLY GREY.,"good."""
2908,NELLY GREY.,
2909,NELLY GREY.,"""Oh no, Phil! I only did what anybody else would have done."""
2910,NELLY GREY.,
2911,NELLY GREY.,"""_Anybody_? You know _I_ didn't want to Nelly,"" said Phil sadly."
2912,NELLY GREY.,
2913,NELLY GREY.,"""Oh, never mind _that_, Phil; you did afterward, you know."""
2914,NELLY GREY.,
2915,NELLY GREY.,"""Well, but, Nell, I _know_ she gave it to you for being so good. Isn't"
2916,NELLY GREY.,"there something on the collar?"""
2917,NELLY GREY.,
2918,NELLY GREY.,"""No, only Frisk's name;"" and she turned to examine it with Phil."
2919,NELLY GREY.,
2920,NELLY GREY.,"""There, Nell! what do you call this?"" and Phil triumphantly held up the"
2921,NELLY GREY.,"edge of the collar, on which was written, ""_Nelly's reward for"
2922,NELLY GREY.,"self-denial.""_"
2923,NELLY GREY.,
2924,NELLY GREY.,"""Why, Phil, I never saw it before; isn't it queer?"""
2925,NELLY GREY.,
2926,NELLY GREY.,"""Queer, that you didn't _see_ it before? Yes; but it isn't queer that"
2927,NELLY GREY.,"she gave it to you No, not at all; I should have thought she would."""
2928,NELLY GREY.,
2929,NELLY GREY.,"""Oh, Phil, how you praise me! you mustn't,"" said Nelly, her pink cheeks"
2930,NELLY GREY.,deepening into scarlet.
2931,NELLY GREY.,
2932,NELLY GREY.,"She deserved praise, did not she? for she was a very good little girl."
2933,NELLY GREY.,"But I will not tire you with any more about her now. So good-by, my"

2948,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,My Young Friends:
2949,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
2950,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,I love to hear and to tell stories nearly as well as when I was a child;
2951,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,but I cannot write them for others to read. Even _small_ children are
2952,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"sometimes _great_ critics. At any rate, I shall not venture at"
2953,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,story-telling here.
2954,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
2955,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,You have all read some portions of the book we call the Bible. But do
2956,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,you know who wrote the Bible? at what time it was written? or anything
2957,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"of the men by whom it was composed? It was not written by any one man,"
2958,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"at one time, and by him sent out to all men in every part of the world;"
2959,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"but by various persons, in different ages, and first addressed to"
2960,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"particular churches or people. I will not attempt, in this article, to"
2961,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"furnish you with an account of all the individuals, Moses, David,"
2962,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Isaiah, Paul, John, and others, who wrote portions of the sacred volume;"
2963,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"but I will try to give you some sketches of _the four Evangelists,_"
2964,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, who wrote the four _gospels_, or Lives of"
2965,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Jesus, to which their names are now attached. And,"
2966,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
2967,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"1st, of MATTHEW, by whom the _first_ gospel was composed. He was"
2968,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"called, also, Levi. He was a Jew, born in the province of Galilee. We"
2969,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,suppose that from his youth he was familiar with the worship of the
2970,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"synagogue and temple, and educated strictly in the religion of Moses. He"
2971,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"filled the office of a publican, was a collector of taxes from the Jews,"
2972,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"to which place he was appointed by the Romans, who, in his day, ruled"
2973,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"over Judea. While engaged in these duties, he became acquainted with the"
2974,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"preaching, miracles, and character of Jesus, the despised Nazarene, and"
2975,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"left all,--his business, friends, home,--to follow him. He journeyed"
2976,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"with Jesus in his ministry, and, after his Master went up to heaven, he"
2977,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,left his own land to preach the gospel among the Gentiles. Some people
2978,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"suppose that he was a martyr, but this is not well established. Matthew"
2979,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"wrote his gospel either in Hebrew or Greek, (some say both,) about 1800"
2980,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"years since,--very soon after his Master had finished the labors of his"
2981,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"mission, and returned unto his Father. I said, I think, that this man"
2982,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,left all; made many sacrifices to become Jesus' disciple. But we do not
2983,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"find this in _his_ book. With other virtues, he was an _humble_ man,"
2984,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"quite too modest to praise himself. Luke, in his narrative, mentions"
2985,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,this fact concerning Matthew. Modesty is a rare virtue; an ornament to
2986,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"the aged, and very beautiful in the young. But I will tell you,"
2987,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
2988,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"2d, of Mark, sometimes called John, and once, John Mark, in the New"
2989,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,Testament. Very little is known concerning this man. He was probably
2990,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"born in Judea, and, it is supposed, was converted to Christianity by the"
2991,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"preaching of the ardent, zealous Peter. At one time, he was the"
2992,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"companion of Paul and Barnabas; but, when a quarrel sprang up between"
2993,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"these men, each went his way. Christians quarrelled then sometimes as"
2994,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"well, or as bad, as in our days. Chiefly, Mark travelled with Peter, as"
2995,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"he went forth among Jews and Gentiles, and aided him in his arduous"
2996,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"toils. He went, at last, to Egypt, where he planted churches, and where,"
2997,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"also, he died. Mark was not an apostle; neither did he attend on the"
2998,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"ministry of Jesus. Do you ask, how, then, could he write a correct"
2999,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,account of our Saviour's life? Here is one fact worth remembering. Mark
3000,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"was the companion of Peter, who was an apostle, who saw the miracles and"
3001,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,heard the discourses of Christ. He examined the account which Mark had
3002,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"written, and gave it his approval, as being correct,--true. Very few men"
3003,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"who write histories have vouchers like his. So, did we not regard the"
3004,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Bible-writers as inspired men, we should place the utmost confidence in"
3005,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"the truth of Mark's gospel. He composed it about A.D. 65. We come now,"
3006,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3007,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"3d, to LUKE. He was a Gentile,--all people not born in Judea were called"
3008,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Gentiles,--born in Antioch, the capital of Syria, where the disciples of"
3009,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Jesus first were called Christians. Luke was a learned man, we are told,"
3010,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"having studied in the famous schools of his own land, also of Greece and"
3011,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Egypt. He was a physician by profession; and physicians assure us, that,"
3012,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"in his gospel, he has given a more accurate account of the diseases"
3013,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,which Jesus cured than any other New Testament writer: that he often
3014,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,uses medical terms in his description of the miracles which were
3015,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"wrought. He was a good and careful thinker, not at all credulous, but"
3016,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"disposed to prove all things, holding fast only to the good and true. He"
3017,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,wrote his gospel (perhaps you know that he was the author of the book of
3018,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Acts, also) in Greece, about 35 years after the ascension of Jesus. He"
3019,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"was associated with Paul in his travels, went with him to Rome, and"
3020,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,continued there during the imprisonment of the apostle. Historians are
3021,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,not agreed in regard to the time or manner of his death. Some affirm
3022,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"that he suffered as a martyr; others, simply, that, in due time, he"
3023,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"""fell asleep,"" or died a natural death. We are sure that his talents,"
3024,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"learning, and time were given to the diffusion of the Christian faith."
3025,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Lastly, and"
3026,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3027,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"4th, of JOHN, the beloved disciple, so termed because of his mild and"
3028,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"gentle spirit, and because he most resembled his and our Master. He was"
3029,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"born in Judea, near the sea, or lake, of Galilee. Zebedee, his father,"
3030,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"was a fisherman; and John, probably, engaged in his father's business"
3031,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"until he became a preacher of glad tidings. You must not, from this"
3032,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"fact, conclude that they were certainly poor men, for then, at least,"
3033,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"men of wealth were engaged in the business, and I suppose many now are."
3034,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"John was the youngest apostle, and ""the disciple whom Jesus loved;"" you"
3035,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"may recollect that he leaned on the bosom of Christ at the ""Last"
3036,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Supper."" He, only, was present, of all the apostles, when Jesus was"
3037,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"crucified,--and Jesus commended his mother to this disciple's care."
3038,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"After the resurrection of Jesus, John preached ""the gospel"" in various"
3039,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,parts of Asia.
3040,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3041,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"He wrote his gospel at Ephesus, and, by his labors, the truths of"
3042,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Christianity spread everywhere among men. The story sometimes told, that"
3043,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"he was put into a caldron of burning oil, by a Roman emperor, and came"
3044,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"out unharmed, is not true. He lived to a very advanced age, and died"
3045,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"when not far from 100 years old. Late in life, when too feeble to"
3046,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"preach, he was often carried into the meetings of the disciples, at his"
3047,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"own request, and, stretching out his hands, as he sat in his chair, was"
3048,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"wont to say, ""Little children, _love_ one another."" And, when asked why"
3049,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"he so often gave this precept, he would say, ""If this be obeyed, it is"
3050,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"the Lord's command, and it sufficeth."""
3051,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3052,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Children, will you think of that precept?"
3053,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3054,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Conversing with two lads once, I asked one, Who wrote the Bible, good"
3055,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"men, or bad men? ""Good men, of course,"" was the response. ""But how do"
3056,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"you know they were _good_ men?"" I rejoined. And he said, ""Because,""--a"
3057,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"very common and very foolish answer,--and was silent. ""I think,"" said"
3058,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"the other lad, the younger of the two, ""that good men wrote the Bible,"
3059,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"because _good_ men _love_ the Bible, and _wicked_ men don't."""
3060,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3061,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,Can you give another reason as good?
3062,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,
3063,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"Now I have told you, briefly, of the four evangelists. They were good"
3064,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"men, honest-minded and sincere. Wicked men, all men, act from motives."
3065,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"But _they_ could have had no motive to deceive. They lost friends, and"
3066,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"wealth, and honor, and ease, and gained contempt, persecution, and"
3067,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"suffering, by preaching the gospel. Their conduct is full evidence that"
3068,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"they were pure and good men. And, if they were good men, they wrote"
3069,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"_the truth_; and, by their labors we have a correct and faithful account"
3070,BY REV. H.R. NYE.,"of the life of Jesus. Study these books, and by them be made wise. Above"

3083,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"It is spring,--a backward spring, it is true, for now it is the first"

3085,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"not a blossom even on a cherry tree; nothing is green but the grass, and"

3087,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,it seems a relief to look upon it.
3088,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3089,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"Poor May-day revellers! May-day this year was pleasant; that is, the sun"
3090,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"shone, the sky was blue, and the grass was green, in spots at least; but"
3091,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"the cold north wind was blowing, and one needed to be told it was the"

3093,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3094,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"The sun was higher than usual on such occasions, when the children came"
3095,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"upon our hill;--yet they did come with wreaths and May-poles, but, ah!"
3096,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,the flowers were artificial. Some of the children had on sun-bonnets and
3097,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"thin shawls; they should have worn hoods and cloaks, and then they might"

3100,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3101,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"Our hill is a famous place for children on May-day, for it is green and"
3102,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"pleasant; it is glorious to run down its sides, and pleasant to sit on"
3103,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"its banks, which once were forts, and behind which, in less peaceful"

3111,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"""Quarter of nine,"" was the reply."
3112,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3113,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"""I didn't think it was so late; did you?"" said she, turning to her"
3114,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"companions. They had been out perhaps two hours, and thought it was most"
3115,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"noon, and back they went to their sports."
3116,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3117,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"Soon I heard a sound of weeping. I went to the door, where stood a group"
3118,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"of children around the pump; one poor shivering child, looking blue and"
3119,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"cold, was having her hands and face washed by another, with water cold"

3128,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3129,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"The poor child still sobbed and shivered. We carried her in, set her"

3132,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"she was so cold, and ""the tops of her fingers did ache so!"""
3133,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3134,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"And this was going a Maying! But yet, next year, these very girls, I"
3135,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"doubt not, will start with just as buoyant hearts for May-day sports,"
3136,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"forgetful of the fall, the cold, and all inconveniences. Ah, childhood's"
3137,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,hopeful heart is a blessed thing!
3138,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3139,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"I well remember now a May-day of by-gone years. Then we had a queen, a"
3140,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"tent, and a table set with numberless delicacies. We had rare sport that"
3141,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,day. The weather was not as cold as the day of which I have been
3142,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"speaking; we had a few _real_ flowers, and some hardy girls even"
3143,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,appeared in white dresses. The forenoon passed pleasantly; numerous
3144,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"visitors thronged to see us, and we were the happiest of all May-day"
3145,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,revellers. But all pleasure must have an end. Soon word came that we
3146,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"must surrender the sails of our tent, for the owner had need thereof."
3147,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"This caused a general _strike_, and, in the confusion which ensued, a"
3148,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"boy had the misfortune to sit or fall upon the queen's straw bonnet,"
3149,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,which had been laid aside for her flowery crown. It was literally
3150,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"smashed, unfit for further use. ""Ah what will mother say?"" was all the"
3151,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"disappointed queen could say. Some few laughed at the queer, misshapen"
3152,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"thing, but more looked on with sad countenances, for it was the queen's"
3153,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,best bonnet.
3154,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3155,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"We separated, tired, and, it may be, a little out of humor; but yet, a"
3156,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,few days made everything bright again; we remembered the pleasure with
3157,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"pleasure, and thought of the disappointments only to laugh over them."
3158,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3159,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"And that bent, spoiled bonnet! When the ex-queen appeared in a fine new"
3160,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"one, with gay ribbons, many looked on, and almost wished that they had"
3161,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,been so fortunate as to have had their bonnets spoiled.

3163,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"As I look back, other May-days throng upon my mind. The memories of some"
3164,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"of these are sad, yea, very sad! One was the birth-day of a little one"
3165,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,who now rests beneath the green sod. And well do I remember another
3166,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"bright May morning, when I wandered out over the hill, holding the hand"
3167,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,of a little fair-haired child within my own. Her tiny basket was filled
3168,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"with flowers the children had given her, and her bright, sunny face was"
3169,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"radiant with smiles. That was her first May-day walk, and much did the"
3170,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,little being enjoy it.
3171,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3172,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"It was her last! Ere the spring breezes came again, she lay within her"
3173,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"little shroud. The snows of winter fell silently upon her little grave,"
3174,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"by the side of him who had gone before, and, ere another May-day, the"
3175,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,sod was green above them.
3176,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,
3177,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,These are the memories that come over me when I look out upon the
3178,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"revellers; yet just as well do I love to see them at their sports, and I"

3180,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"laughter; and, though my heart goes to the grave-yard and mine eyes rest"
3181,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"upon the spot, yet I can smile upon the gay, living creatures before me,"
3182,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"for I know that childhood is a glad and joyous thing, and that these"

3186,BY MRS. NANCY T. MUNROE.,"These my May-day reveries have begun lightly, and ended, as May-days"

3272,CAGING BIRDS.,"suffer even in the best season of the year, from the fact of his having"
3273,CAGING BIRDS.,"been taken when so young from other robins. Confinement, probably, does"
3274,CAGING BIRDS.,"not destroy the instinct of birds, so that they would starve if"
3275,CAGING BIRDS.,"released. After having been an inmate of our family nine years, having"
3276,CAGING BIRDS.,suffered countless frights and manglings from the many kittens we had
3277,CAGING BIRDS.,"kept in the time, he at last died by the claws of the family cat, when"
3278,CAGING BIRDS.,"released one fine afternoon for an airing, and to have his cage cleaned."
3279,CAGING BIRDS.,
3280,CAGING BIRDS.,I never since have wished to own a caged bird. The song of a canary
3281,CAGING BIRDS.,"bird, born and reared in a cage, never pleases me like the cheerful"
3282,CAGING BIRDS.,"warbling or merry whistle of the wild, free birds of our woodlands. The"
3283,CAGING BIRDS.,one seems but the expression of a cheerful forgiveness of unkind
3284,CAGING BIRDS.,"treatment, the bursting forth of a happy nature in spite of man's"
3285,CAGING BIRDS.,"cruelty; while the other seems a free outpouring of perfect happiness,"
3286,CAGING BIRDS.,and the choicest notes of a grateful little being directed to the good
3287,CAGING BIRDS.,GOD of nature.
3288,CAGING BIRDS.,
3289,CAGING BIRDS.,"I know we often hear of happy, contented little pet birds; yet I never"
3290,CAGING BIRDS.,saw one that did not seem to prefer the freedom of an out-of-door
3291,CAGING BIRDS.,"excursion on the strong, free wing, to the hopping, swinging, perching,"
3292,CAGING BIRDS.,"and fluttering, within a narrow cage. The taming and petting of"
3293,CAGING BIRDS.,"sparrows, robins, yellow-birds, snow-birds, and swallows, round the"
3294,CAGING BIRDS.,"doors or windows of one's house, I admire. There is nothing inhuman in"
3295,CAGING BIRDS.,this practice. It rather calls forth some of the better feelings of the
3296,CAGING BIRDS.,"heart--gives pleasure to us and the birds, yet violates no law of"
3297,CAGING BIRDS.,nature.
3298,CAGING BIRDS.,
3299,CAGING BIRDS.,I here give you a little story of a pet swallow that I met with in a
3300,CAGING BIRDS.,"little English book, which, perhaps, few of you have read. The children"
3301,CAGING BIRDS.,"named in the story were certainly kind-hearted towards their little pet,"
3302,CAGING BIRDS.,and very indulgent. Mark well their reward! Some of you may be induced
3303,CAGING BIRDS.,"to imitate them; at least, I hope you will not again be so selfish as to"
3304,CAGING BIRDS.,"cage a bird for his song, while, with the exercise of a little patience"
3305,CAGING BIRDS.,"and kindly attention, you can tame them so easily at your door."

3309,THE PET SWALLOW.,THE PET SWALLOW.
3310,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3311,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3312,THE PET SWALLOW.,"One day we had been out gathering primroses, and, to put the pretty pale"
3313,THE PET SWALLOW.,"flowers neatly into baskets, we had sat down under one of the windows in"
3314,THE PET SWALLOW.,"the old church tower. Mary was sitting next the wall, when something"
3315,THE PET SWALLOW.,"touched her shoulder, and fell on her knee. It was a young swallow,"
3316,THE PET SWALLOW.,"without any feathers, that had fallen, or perhaps had been thrown, out"
3317,THE PET SWALLOW.,"of the nest, by some quarrelsome brother or sister."
3318,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3319,THE PET SWALLOW.,"The poor primroses were cast away, and every little hand was ready to"
3320,THE PET SWALLOW.,"seize the prize. When we found it was not killed, or even hurt, by its"
3321,THE PET SWALLOW.,"fall, some called for a cage; others said, ""Let us put it back in the"
3322,THE PET SWALLOW.,nest; we do not know what to give it to eat; we may be sure it will
3323,THE PET SWALLOW.,"die."" And this seemed so very true that we were all obliged to agree;"
3324,THE PET SWALLOW.,"but, alas! the poor swallow having built in a false window of the tower,"
3325,THE PET SWALLOW.,"there was no way of getting to the nest, and so the cage was brought,"
3326,THE PET SWALLOW.,"and the little bird did not die, but grew bigger and prettier every day,"
3327,THE PET SWALLOW.,"until at last it could skim through the room on its pretty, soft wings,"
3328,THE PET SWALLOW.,"and would dive down to us, and light upon our shoulders, or let itself"
3329,THE PET SWALLOW.,"fall into our hands. How we did love that little bird! and oh, how sorry"
3330,THE PET SWALLOW.,"we were one day, when it flew out at the window! We all ran down to the"
3331,THE PET SWALLOW.,"lawn; we were quite sure it would never come back to us again, for it"
3332,THE PET SWALLOW.,seemed so happy to be free; and we watched it flying here and there--now
3333,THE PET SWALLOW.,"high in the air, now close down to the ground. We had called our pretty"
3334,THE PET SWALLOW.,"bird Fairy, and it really seemed like a fairy now; one moment it was"
3335,THE PET SWALLOW.,"quite out of sight, the next so near it almost touched us. At last, Fred"
3336,THE PET SWALLOW.,"gave a long, loud whistle; when he began, it was up in the air, high,"
3337,THE PET SWALLOW.,"high above our heads, but, before the sound passed away, it was"
3338,THE PET SWALLOW.,fluttering its pretty dark wings upon his face. From this time Fairy was
3339,THE PET SWALLOW.,allowed to go free; and it would skim about before our windows all day
3340,THE PET SWALLOW.,"long, coming in from time to time to pay us visits, and to sleep at"
3341,THE PET SWALLOW.,nights in its old post on the top of one of our little beds in the
3342,THE PET SWALLOW.,nursery.
3343,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3344,THE PET SWALLOW.,"At last August came, and then our pretty Fairy skimmed through the air,"
3345,THE PET SWALLOW.,"far, far beyond the reach of Fred's whistle, for it had set out, with"
3346,THE PET SWALLOW.,"all the other swallows, on its long voyage across the seas."
3347,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3348,THE PET SWALLOW.,"We had never thought of this,--never thought that our faithful Fairy"
3349,THE PET SWALLOW.,"would so leave us,--and it was many days before the hope of its coming"
3350,THE PET SWALLOW.,back next year could make us feel at all happy again.
3351,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3352,THE PET SWALLOW.,"But Fairy, our own dear little Fairy, _did_ come back, and it remembered"
3353,THE PET SWALLOW.,"us all, as if it had been away only for a few hours, instead of nearly"
3354,THE PET SWALLOW.,eight whole months.
3355,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3356,THE PET SWALLOW.,"It was a very happy day, the day that Fairy came back, and it seemed to"
3357,THE PET SWALLOW.,"feel as much joy as we did; first it flew to Mary, and then to Fred, and"
3358,THE PET SWALLOW.,"then to one after the other, twittering its wings, and rubbing its"
3359,THE PET SWALLOW.,"pretty black head on our hands or faces, as we see dogs and cats do"
3360,THE PET SWALLOW.,when they want to show great kindness.
3361,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3362,THE PET SWALLOW.,"It flew to the top of the little bed at night, pecked at the window when"
3363,THE PET SWALLOW.,"it wished to get out in the morning, and would dart down at Fred's"
3364,THE PET SWALLOW.,"whistle as readily as it had been used to do the year before. In short,"
3365,THE PET SWALLOW.,"notwithstanding the long voyage it had made, Fairy seemed to have"
3366,THE PET SWALLOW.,forgotten neither its old friends nor its old ways.
3367,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3368,THE PET SWALLOW.,"When it came near the time for the swallows to fly away again, we grew"
3369,THE PET SWALLOW.,very sad at the idea of losing our pretty Fairy: some thought it would
3370,THE PET SWALLOW.,"be wise to put it into a cage, and keep it there until all the others"
3371,THE PET SWALLOW.,"were gone; while some, who were wiser, said it was Fairy's nature to go"
3372,THE PET SWALLOW.,"away, and that Fairy must go. But what do you think was our joy to find,"
3373,THE PET SWALLOW.,"that, of its own good will, Fairy stayed with us? All the others went"
3374,THE PET SWALLOW.,"away; and, whether it had grown fonder of us, or that it had not liked"
3375,THE PET SWALLOW.,"the long voyage it had been led into by the example of others, I cannot"
3376,THE PET SWALLOW.,"say; but for four winters it stayed always with us, taking a flight now"
3377,THE PET SWALLOW.,"and then in the open air, but spending the greatest part of the day in"
3378,THE PET SWALLOW.,"the school-room, till summer came, when it would again join its friends,"
3379,THE PET SWALLOW.,and always build its nest in the very window from which it had fallen
3380,THE PET SWALLOW.,into Mary's lap.
3381,THE PET SWALLOW.,
3382,THE PET SWALLOW.,"Six years had passed since then, but what now became of it we could"
3383,THE PET SWALLOW.,never learn. For a long time we hoped it had gone again over sea and
3384,THE PET SWALLOW.,"land, to visit far countries with all the others, but whether it had or"
3385,THE PET SWALLOW.,"not we never knew, for we saw our pretty Fairy no more."
