50,DEDICATION.,"When I first saw you--never mind the year--you could speak no English,"
51,DEDICATION.,"and when next I saw you, after a lapse of two years, you _would_"
52,DEDICATION.,"prattle no French; when again we met, you were the nymph with bright"
53,DEDICATION.,"and flowing hair, which frightened his Highness Prince James out of"
54,DEDICATION.,"his feline senses, when, as you came in by the door, he made his bolt"
55,DEDICATION.,"by the window. It was then that you entreated me, with ""most"
56,DEDICATION.,"petitionary vehemence,"" to write you a book--a big book--thick, and"
57,DEDICATION.,all for yourself--
58,DEDICATION.,
59,DEDICATION.,"""Apollo heard, and granting half the prayer,"
60,DEDICATION.,"Shuffled to winds the rest and tossed in air."""
61,DEDICATION.,
62,DEDICATION.,"I have not written the book, nor is it thick: but I have printed you a"
63,DEDICATION.,"book, and it is thin. And I take the occasion to note that old Geoffry"
64,DEDICATION.,"Chaucer, our father poet, must have had you in his mind's eye, by"
65,DEDICATION.,"prescience or precognition, or he could hardly else have written two"
66,DEDICATION.,"poems, one on the daisy and one on the rose. They are poems too long"
67,DEDICATION.,"for modern days, nor are we equal in patience to our fore-fathers, who"
68,DEDICATION.,"read 'The Faërie Queen,' 'Gondibert,' and the 'Polyolbion,' annually,"
69,DEDICATION.,"as they cheeringly averred, _through and out_. Photography, steam, and"
70,DEDICATION.,"electricity make us otherwise, and Patience has fled to the spheres;"
71,DEDICATION.,"therefore, if feasible, shall ""brevity be the soul of wit,"" and we"
72,DEDICATION.,"will eschew ""tediousness and outward flourishes"" in compressing 'The"
73,DEDICATION.,Flower and the Leaf' into little:--
74,DEDICATION.,
75,DEDICATION.,
76,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.
77,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
78,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"A maiden in greenwood in month of sweet May,"
79,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Arose and awoke at the dawn of the day:
80,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"As she wended along,"
81,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,She heard fairie song--
82,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Si doulce est la Margarite."""
83,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"There the Ladye the Flower and Ladye the Leaf,"
84,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"With knights and squires of fairie chief,"
85,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Were met upon mead,"
86,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,For devoir and deed--
87,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Homage unto ""La doulce Margarite."""
88,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
89,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,There the ladye in white and the ladye in green
90,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Sat on their thrones by the Fairie Queen,"
91,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Whilst knights did their duty,"
92,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And bowed down to beauty--
93,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Si doulce est la Margarite,""--"
94,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"When the skies grew hot and the ladies pale,"
95,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And the storm descended in lightning and hail,"
96,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"As they danced and sung,"
97,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And the burden rung--
98,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Sous la feuille, sous la feuille, meet."""
99,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
100,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Our Ladye of Leaf asked her of the Flower
101,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And fairie Nymphs to shelter in bower:
102,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And they danced and sung,"
103,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And the refrain rung--
104,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Si doulce est la Margarite."""
105,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"All woe begone shivered the Ladye Flower,"
106,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The Ladye Leaf glittered in gems from the shower:
107,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"As they danced and sung,"
108,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And the refrain rung--
109,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Si doulce est la Margarite."""
110,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
111,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And knights and squires then wended forth,"
112,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"East and west, and south, and north:"
113,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,To free forests and shores
114,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"From giants and boars,"
115,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And shelter in night and in storm;
116,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And every knight bore _in chief_ on his shield
117,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The _foyle en verte_ on an _argent_ field:
118,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And they rode and they sung
119,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The huge oaks among:--
120,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Sous la feuille, sous la feuille, dorme."""
121,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
122,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The maiden then asked of the Fairie Queen
123,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,To tell her the moral of what she had seen:
124,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Who answered and sung
125,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,In her fairie tongue--
126,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Si doulce est la Margarite."""
127,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The knight that is wise will lead from bower
128,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The lasting Leaf--not the fading Flower:
129,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And when storms arise
130,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,To turmoil life's skies--
131,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"""Sous la feuille, sous la feuille, meet."""

136,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Within my twentie yeares of age,"
137,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"When Love asserteth most his courage,"
138,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"I dreamed a dream, now fain to tell--"
139,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,A dream that pleased me wondrous well.
140,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Now this dream will I rime aright,"
141,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,To make your heartes gaye and light;
142,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,For Love desireth it--also
143,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Commandeth me that it be so.
144,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"It is the Romaunt of the Rose,"
145,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And tale of love I must disclose.
146,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Fair is the matter for to make,"
147,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,But fairer--if she will to take
148,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,For whom the romaunt is begonne
149,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,For that I wis she is the fair one
150,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Of mokle prise; and therefore she
151,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,So worthier is beloved to be;
152,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And well she ought of prise and right
153,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Be clepened Rose of every wight.
154,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"But it was May, thus dreamed me,--"
155,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,A time of love and jollitie:
156,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"A time there is no husks or straw,"
157,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,But new grene leaves on everie shaw;
158,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"The woods were grene, the earth was proud,"
159,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Beastès and birdès snug aloud;
160,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And earth her poore estate forgote,"
161,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,In which the winter her had fraught.
162,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Ah! ben in May the sunne is bright,"
163,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And everie thing does take delight:
164,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The nightingale then singeth blithe;
165,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Then is blissful many a scithe;
166,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"The goldfinch and the popinjay,"
167,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,They then have many things to say.
168,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Hard is his heart that loveth nought
169,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"In May, when all such love is wrought."
170,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
171,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Right from my bed full readilie,"
172,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,That it was by the morrow earlie;
173,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And up I rose, and gan me clothe"
174,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Anon I with my handès bothe:
175,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,A silver needle forth I drew
176,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Out of an aguiler quainte inew,"
177,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And gan this needle threade anone,"
178,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"For out of town me list to gone,"
179,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Jollife and gaye, full of gladnesse,"
180,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Towards a river gan I me dresse,"
181,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,For from a hill that stood there neere
182,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Came down the stream of that rivere--
183,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"My face, I wis, there saw I wele,"
184,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,The bottom ypaved everie dele
185,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"With gravel, which was shining shene,"
186,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,In meadows soft and soote and greene.
187,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And full attempre out of drede
188,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Then gan I walken throw the mede
189,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Downward ever in my playing
190,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,As the river's waters straying;
191,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And when I had awhile igone
192,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"I saw a garden right anone,"
193,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Of walls with many portraitures,"
194,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And bothe of images and peintures--
195,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
196,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,But you may read it as it flows
197,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,In Chaucer's _Romaunt of the Rose_.
198,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
199,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
200,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Chaucer to his Booke.
201,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,
202,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Now go, my booke, and be courageous,"

204,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And though ye may find some outrageous,"
205,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And in a pette be in some cornere hurl'd;
206,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Yet you by little fingeres will be greasèd
207,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And known hereafter by the marke of thumbe;

210,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And there be some, perchance, will bidde you off"

220,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Above whose fountains doth The Grove uproar,"
221,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Like to Mount Helicon, where Clio sings,"
222,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Where rookès build, and peacocke spreadeth tail."
223,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And there the wood-pigeon doth sobbe Coo coo;
224,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"Neither do sparrow, merle or mavis fail,"
225,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,And there the owl at midnight singeth Whoo.
226,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"And where there are a Laurel and a Rose,"
227,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,Beneath whose branches wide a broode doth haunt;
228,THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF.,"The whom high walls and fretted gates enclose,"

4988,POSTSCRIPT.,palace. Power then ran into a new groove of corruption and bribery; and
4989,POSTSCRIPT.,"the scene, vile in itself, was made viler by exaggeration and the"
4990,POSTSCRIPT.,"retaliations of one political party on the other, whilst either side was"
4991,POSTSCRIPT.,equally lauded by its own party. Therefore we may reasonably conclude
4992,POSTSCRIPT.,"that matters were not so bad as they were painted, and moreover that it"
4993,POSTSCRIPT.,"was but a change and transition of evils, to play a part and disappear."
4994,POSTSCRIPT.,"The advent of the third George to the throne, and the rigid integrity of"
4995,POSTSCRIPT.,"the first and second Pitt, reversed the story as read in these fables;"
4996,POSTSCRIPT.,"the court became pure, the king true, the ministers honest, and the"
4997,POSTSCRIPT.,"nation progressed from the miserable peace of Utrecht, in 1714, to the"
4998,POSTSCRIPT.,"proud position we held on its centenary at Vienna, in 1814. We may"
4999,POSTSCRIPT.,"grant, then, that Gay had reason on his side when he inveighed so"
5000,POSTSCRIPT.,"bitterly against courts and kings; and, granting that, we may recognise"
5001,POSTSCRIPT.,"the amelioration of the court of the present day, wholly free from"
5002,POSTSCRIPT.,corruption and presenting a school to be followed rather than contemned.
5003,POSTSCRIPT.,
5004,POSTSCRIPT.,"In the fable of the 'Degenerate Bees,' Gay takes the part of the Tory"
5005,POSTSCRIPT.,"ministry,--Oxford, Bolingbroke, Dean Swift, and Mat. Prior; and in the"
5006,POSTSCRIPT.,'Ant in Office' he alludes to a Whig minister of that day. We must not
5007,POSTSCRIPT.,be too hard on ministers. Kings and the nation have been open to bribes
5008,POSTSCRIPT.,"and assenting to French diplomacy,--"
5009,POSTSCRIPT.,
5010,POSTSCRIPT.,"""When policy regained what arms had lost."""
5011,POSTSCRIPT.,
5012,POSTSCRIPT.,"Louis XI. purchased the retreat of Edward IV. in 1475, when he seized"
5013,POSTSCRIPT.,"on the domains of King Réné--Provence, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and"
5014,POSTSCRIPT.,"Lorraine, and Burgundy from the domains of Charles the Bold; when we"
5015,POSTSCRIPT.,"abandoned our blood allies for bribes. Again, in 1681, Charles II. was"
5016,POSTSCRIPT.,"the pensioner of Louis XIV., when Louis seized on Strasbourg. William"
5017,POSTSCRIPT.,"III. reluctantly let it pass at the peace and treaty of Ryswick, which"
5018,POSTSCRIPT.,Louis dictated; and it was very basely abandoned by us at the peace of
5019,POSTSCRIPT.,"Utrecht, in 1714, when we abandoned our ally the emperor, and the"
5020,POSTSCRIPT.,"degenerate Bees of the fable suffered exile and the Tower, barely"
5021,POSTSCRIPT.,"escaping death from the indignant nation. Again, in the treaty of"
5022,POSTSCRIPT.,"Vienna, 1814, we sacrificed the interests of Austria to France, in"
5023,POSTSCRIPT.,ceding to the latter the pillaged counties of the Messin and of Alsace.
5024,POSTSCRIPT.,"Finding, therefore, like results from wholly different causes, we must"
5025,POSTSCRIPT.,"not be extreme to judge, but, with Gay, admit the ministers of 1714 to"
5026,POSTSCRIPT.,"grace, for they only then did what we sanctioned in 1814, and which 1870"
5027,POSTSCRIPT.,"sees righted, and the German towns restored to Germany."
5028,POSTSCRIPT.,
5029,POSTSCRIPT.,I am now rounding off half a century in which I have wandered in this
5030,POSTSCRIPT.,"wilderness of a world, and in all that time I have never known, or heard"
5031,POSTSCRIPT.,"of, corruption in a minister of state. I have seen and known many fall"
5032,POSTSCRIPT.,untimely to ministerial labours and responsibility. Walking through the
5033,POSTSCRIPT.,"streets and squares we may behold the noble brows of Pitt, Canning, Lord"
5034,POSTSCRIPT.,"George Bentinck, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Palmerston--men ""on whose brows"
5035,POSTSCRIPT.,"shame is ashamed to sit""--and, we might add, another Canning, a Follett,"
5036,POSTSCRIPT.,"Sir George Lewis, and a hecatomb of Colonial rulers, who have died,"
5037,POSTSCRIPT.,overtasked by toil and responsibility; but in all that time we have
5038,POSTSCRIPT.,"never heard a minister accused of corruption, or building palaces, or"
5039,POSTSCRIPT.,"making a fortune from public treasure. Corruption, if so it may still be"
5040,POSTSCRIPT.,"termed, has taken another phase; it has bowed its head and courted"
5041,POSTSCRIPT.,"democracy, like to the Roman king, Ancus Martius, ""nimium gaudens"
5042,POSTSCRIPT.,"popularibus auris""--cringing to popular suffrage--to ride into place and"
5043,POSTSCRIPT.,"power, by granting measures momentarily floating uppermost, and"
5044,POSTSCRIPT.,"suffering the tail to guide the head, as did the snake in Æsop's fable."
5045,POSTSCRIPT.,We attained the height of grandeur of 1814 under the guidance of the
5046,POSTSCRIPT.,"head, and we are now upon our trial of democratical government, and"
5047,POSTSCRIPT.,whether it be equal to the old. Under such auspices commerce has been
5048,POSTSCRIPT.,the petted minion of the last thirty years. Not the native forest tree
5049,POSTSCRIPT.,"of Pitt, Huskisson, and Canning, but the hot-bed plant of the advocates"
5050,POSTSCRIPT.,of a predominant trade. No British statesman ever dreamt of restricting
5051,POSTSCRIPT.,"commerce,--which ever was the bond of unity of nations; but we have sunk"
5052,POSTSCRIPT.,"every interest at home to swell the exports and imports, to make Britain"
5053,POSTSCRIPT.,what Egypt was in the days of the patriarch--the storehouse of the
5054,POSTSCRIPT.,"world. Egypt and England both put their agriculturists to pain, and the"
5055,POSTSCRIPT.,rural population to serfdom; but they only exchange the stable basis of
5056,POSTSCRIPT.,"well-being for an unstable one, for commerce is proverbially of a"
5057,POSTSCRIPT.,fleeting nature.
5058,POSTSCRIPT.,
5059,POSTSCRIPT.,The age in which Gay wrote was eminently what we now designate as
5060,POSTSCRIPT.,"conservative. Excise was hateful then; as customs are denounced now, so"
5061,POSTSCRIPT.,"home taxation was denounced then. So wonderfully do systems change, that"
5062,POSTSCRIPT.,"in the monthly table of the revenue of this period (December, 1870), the"
5063,POSTSCRIPT.,"customs do not raise one-third of the revenue, of which the other"
5064,POSTSCRIPT.,two-thirds are raised by home taxation.
5065,POSTSCRIPT.,
5066,POSTSCRIPT.,From ministers proceed we to the misers. I doubt whether any domestic
5067,POSTSCRIPT.,changes have wrought so great an amelioration in our well-being as banks
5068,POSTSCRIPT.,"and banking. It has saved us from burglars; it has, by cheques, redeemed"
5069,POSTSCRIPT.,us from the tyranny of tradesmen's books. It has put personal property
5070,POSTSCRIPT.,"on a stronger foundation than it held, and the banker keeps an excellent"
5071,POSTSCRIPT.,"private account, gratuitously, of your receipts and expenditure. The"
5072,POSTSCRIPT.,trouble that the possession of gold gave to its possessor before this
5073,POSTSCRIPT.,"wonderful institution was brought to bear, may be told by a few"
5074,POSTSCRIPT.,instances of divers epochs. There is a tale of a man who was supposed to
5075,POSTSCRIPT.,"have discovered the treasures of Croesus, in the treasury--such as is"
5076,POSTSCRIPT.,shown now at Mycenæ and Orchomenos as the treasuries of old. The hero of
5077,POSTSCRIPT.,"the tale having discovered the crypt and its hoard, built another, and"
5078,POSTSCRIPT.,spent half of his life in secretly removing the treasures of Croesus
5079,POSTSCRIPT.,to his new treasury; which was no sooner a deed accomplished than he
5080,POSTSCRIPT.,"perceived the original treasury was superior to the new, and he spent an"
5081,POSTSCRIPT.,equal amount of years in secretly restoring the treasures to their
5082,POSTSCRIPT.,"original crypt, where doubtless they are now, for he died whilst he was"
5083,POSTSCRIPT.,the slave to the gold. Herodotus has stories quite as marvellous as
5084,POSTSCRIPT.,"this, of the fortunate finder of the treasures of Croesus. But our"
5085,POSTSCRIPT.,"friend Mr. Pepys--who, I believe, has given us more amusement than any"
5086,POSTSCRIPT.,"other Englishman, be he whom he may--is more amusing and instructive."
5087,POSTSCRIPT.,"His story is written in 1667, the year after the fire of London, and"
5088,POSTSCRIPT.,"whilst the invasion of the Dutch was apprehended, and we will see how"
5089,POSTSCRIPT.,"Mr. Pepys fulfilled the adage of ""as much trouble as all my money."" On"
5090,POSTSCRIPT.,"30th March, 1666, we find him write:--""I to Lombard St., and there"
5091,POSTSCRIPT.,"received 2200_l._, and brought it home, and, contrary to expectation,"
5092,POSTSCRIPT.,"received 35_l._ for the use of 2000_l._ of it for a quarter of a year,"
5093,POSTSCRIPT.,"where it hath produced me this profit, and hath been a conveniency to me"
5094,POSTSCRIPT.,"as to care and security at my house, and demandable at two days'"
5095,POSTSCRIPT.,"warning, as this has been."""
5096,POSTSCRIPT.,
5097,POSTSCRIPT.,"On 12th November: ""This day I received 450 pieces of gold, which cost me"
5098,POSTSCRIPT.,"22-1/2_d._ change. But I am well contented with it, I having now nearly"
5099,POSTSCRIPT.,"2800_l._ in gold, and will not rest till I get full 3000_l._"" But on the"
5100,POSTSCRIPT.,"13th June, 1667, on the sad news of the taking of the 'Royal Charles,'"
5101,POSTSCRIPT.,"and sinking ships at Barking Creek, ""put me into such a fear, that I"
5102,POSTSCRIPT.,presently resolved of my father's and wife's going into the country; and
5103,POSTSCRIPT.,at two hours' warning they did go by the coach this day with 1300_l._ in
5104,POSTSCRIPT.,"gold in their night-bag. Pray God give them good passage, and good care"
5105,POSTSCRIPT.,"to hide it when they come home! But my heart is full of fear. They gone,"
5106,POSTSCRIPT.,"I continued in frights and fear what to do with the rest."""
5107,POSTSCRIPT.,
5108,POSTSCRIPT.,"And on the 10th October, when the Dutch were gone, we read:--""Up, and"
5109,POSTSCRIPT.,"to walk up and down in the garden with my father, to talk of all our"
5110,POSTSCRIPT.,"concernments: about a husband for my sister, whereof there is at present"
5111,POSTSCRIPT.,"no appearance; but we must endeavour to find her one now, for she grows"
5112,POSTSCRIPT.,"old and ugly. My father and I with a dark lantern, it being now light,"
5113,POSTSCRIPT.,"into the garden with my wife, and there went about our great work to dig"
5114,POSTSCRIPT.,"up my gold. But, Lord, what a tosse I was for some time in, that they"
5115,POSTSCRIPT.,"could not justly tell where it was: but by-and-bye, poking with a spit,"
5116,POSTSCRIPT.,"we found it, and then began with a spudd. But, good God! to see how"
5117,POSTSCRIPT.,"sillily they did it, not half a foot under ground, and in the sight of"
5118,POSTSCRIPT.,"the world from a hundred places, and within sight of a neighbour's"
5119,POSTSCRIPT.,window. Only my father says that he saw them all gone to church before
5120,POSTSCRIPT.,he began the work when he laid the money. But I was out of my wits
5121,POSTSCRIPT.,"almost, and the more from that, upon my lifting the earth with my spudd,"
5122,POSTSCRIPT.,I did discern that I had scattered the pieces of gold in the loose
5123,POSTSCRIPT.,"earth, and, taking up the iron head-pieces whereon they were put, I"
5124,POSTSCRIPT.,"perceived the earth had gotten among the gold, and wet, so that the bags"
5125,POSTSCRIPT.,were all rotten and notes; so that I could not tell what in the world to
5126,POSTSCRIPT.,"say to it, not knowing how to judge what was wanting, or what had been"
5127,POSTSCRIPT.,"lost by Gibson in his journey down, which, all put together, did make me"
5128,POSTSCRIPT.,"mad. And at last I was obliged to take up the pieces, dirt and all, by"
5129,POSTSCRIPT.,"candle-light, and carry them into my brother's chamber, and there lock"
5130,POSTSCRIPT.,"them up, whilst I eat a little supper; and then, all people going to"
5131,POSTSCRIPT.,"bed, William Hewer and I did, all alone, with pails of water and besoms,"
5132,POSTSCRIPT.,"wash the dirt off the pieces, and then began to tell them, by a note"
5133,POSTSCRIPT.,"which I had of the value of the whole in my pocket, and do find that"
5134,POSTSCRIPT.,"there was short above a hundred pieces, which did make me mad.... So"
5135,POSTSCRIPT.,"William Hewer and I out again about midnight, and there by candle-light"
5136,POSTSCRIPT.,"did make shift to gather forty pieces more; and so to bed, and there lay"
5137,POSTSCRIPT.,"in some disquiet until daylight. 11th.--And then William Hewer and I,"
5138,POSTSCRIPT.,"with pails and a sieve, did lock ourselves into the garden, and did"
5139,POSTSCRIPT.,gather the earth and then sift those pails in one of the summer-houses
5140,POSTSCRIPT.,"(just as they do for diamonds in other parts), and there, to our great"
5141,POSTSCRIPT.,"content did, by nine o'clock, make the last night's forty-five up to"
5142,POSTSCRIPT.,seventy-nine; so that we are come to some twenty or thirty of what I
5143,POSTSCRIPT.,think the true number should be. So do leave my father to make a second
5144,POSTSCRIPT.,"examination of the dirt, and my mind at rest on it, being but an"
5145,POSTSCRIPT.,accident; and so give me some kind of content to remember how painful it
5146,POSTSCRIPT.,"is sometimes to keep money as well as to get it, and how doubtful I was"
5147,POSTSCRIPT.,"to keep it all night, and how to secure it to London."
5148,POSTSCRIPT.,
5149,POSTSCRIPT.,"""About ten o'clock, took coach, my wife and I, and Willett and W. Hewer,"
5150,POSTSCRIPT.,and Mumford and Bowles (whom my lady sent me to go along with me my
5151,POSTSCRIPT.,"journey, not telling her the reason, but it was only to secure my gold),"
5152,POSTSCRIPT.,and my brother John on horseback; and with these four I thought myself
5153,POSTSCRIPT.,"pretty safe. My gold I put into a basket, and set it under one of the"
5154,POSTSCRIPT.,seats; and so my work every quarter of an hour was to look to see
5155,POSTSCRIPT.,whether all was well; and I did ride in great fear all the day.
5156,POSTSCRIPT.,"12th.--By five o'clock got home, and did bring my gold to my heart's"
5157,POSTSCRIPT.,"content very safe, having not this day carried it in a basket, but in"
5158,POSTSCRIPT.,"our hands; the girl took care of one, and my wife of another bag, and I"
5159,POSTSCRIPT.,"the rest, I being afraid of the bottom of the coach lest it should"
5160,POSTSCRIPT.,"break."" Such is Mr. Pepys' story."
5161,POSTSCRIPT.,
5162,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Nor light nor darkness brings his pains relief:"
5163,POSTSCRIPT.,"One shows the plunder, and one hides the thief."""
5164,POSTSCRIPT.,
5165,POSTSCRIPT.,Mr. Crabbe has portrayed the marvel of an honest inhabitant of
5166,POSTSCRIPT.,"Aldborough, when first he learnt, in his graphic phrase, ""that money"
5167,POSTSCRIPT.,"would breed,""--that it could afford to pay yearly interest. Shakespeare"
5168,POSTSCRIPT.,"has several references to the fact. Shylock, and a clown in 'Twelfth"
5169,POSTSCRIPT.,Night' making very quaint allusions. I shall only add one more tale from
5170,POSTSCRIPT.,"Mr. S. Trench's late stories of 'Realities of Irish Life.' A neighbour,"
5171,POSTSCRIPT.,"who had saved two hundred pounds in gold, kept it in the thatch of his"
5172,POSTSCRIPT.,"roof. One day he appeared before Mr. Trench bearing his gold, and"
5173,POSTSCRIPT.,"requesting him to be his depositee, expressing the comfort it would"
5174,POSTSCRIPT.,"afford him. Mr. Trench declined the unprofitable duty, and pointed out"
5175,POSTSCRIPT.,"to him the bank, which would accept his deposit and give him interest."
5176,POSTSCRIPT.,The eye of Patrick flashed with intelligence and foresight as he warned
5177,POSTSCRIPT.,"Mr. Trench from the delusion of banks, which every year wasted the"
5178,POSTSCRIPT.,"original sum by paying the stipend, and when you wished to reclaim the"
5179,POSTSCRIPT.,"original, lo, it had disappeared. No, no, he would have no dividend,"
5180,POSTSCRIPT.,"forsooth, to eat away his capital; which he bore back again (about five"
5181,POSTSCRIPT.,pounds' weight) and replaced it in his thatch. It was neither lost nor
5182,POSTSCRIPT.,"wasted there; it became the inheritance of his only daughter, a woman of"
5183,POSTSCRIPT.,"extreme energy, who had from childhood loved--more, methinks, as a"
5184,POSTSCRIPT.,"mother loves a helpless child--a good-hearted, unvicious piece of"
5185,POSTSCRIPT.,"indolence and sloth. She followed him to New York and married him,"
5186,POSTSCRIPT.,"_nolens volens_; and Providence assigned to him an energetic woman, to"
5187,POSTSCRIPT.,make his castle of indolence a bed of roses to the satisfaction of them
5188,POSTSCRIPT.,"both,--supplying for each the energy and the repose, both"
5189,POSTSCRIPT.,"constitutional, both unvicious, which the other lacked."
5190,POSTSCRIPT.,
5191,POSTSCRIPT.,"Highwaymen beset the highways, as burglars invaded the residences; and"
5192,POSTSCRIPT.,Macaulay chuckles over the fact that his _bête noire_--the noble
5193,POSTSCRIPT.,Marlborough--was eased of 5000_l._ in gold in one of his trips between
5194,POSTSCRIPT.,London and St. Alban's.
5195,POSTSCRIPT.,
5196,POSTSCRIPT.,From the regions of ministers and misers we may descend to the equally
5197,POSTSCRIPT.,"disputed realms of the muses. Horace terms it ""the peevish and inhuman"
5198,POSTSCRIPT.,"muse,"" which those who drink of Aganippe's fountain woo; whilst others"
5199,POSTSCRIPT.,are apt to equal their Castalian spring and Parnassus with the height of
5200,POSTSCRIPT.,"the empyreal, regarding with pity the toilers on the land and deep. But"
5201,POSTSCRIPT.,"herein, as in aught else, it is the mind, and not the outward"
5202,POSTSCRIPT.,"circumstances, which makes the happiness suited to its strength and"
5203,POSTSCRIPT.,"position; for it must be confessed it is from the weak in bodily frame,"
5204,POSTSCRIPT.,"the lame, and the blind, that we draw our poets: and when we find a rare"
5205,POSTSCRIPT.,"bodily exception to the rule, we find too often a mind insatiate of"
5206,POSTSCRIPT.,"applause, and pining for more appreciation of their productions. The"
5207,POSTSCRIPT.,votaries of the muse cannot be set down as so happy and contented as
5208,POSTSCRIPT.,"many a ploughman, nor does the smoothness of the lines gratify the eye"
5209,POSTSCRIPT.,more than the smoothness of the furrow. But these rhymes of Gay hardly
5210,POSTSCRIPT.,"aspire to the height of poesy, nor do they possess the banter and"
5211,POSTSCRIPT.,"raciness, such as we find in Butler's 'Hudibras':--"
5212,POSTSCRIPT.,
5213,POSTSCRIPT.,"""When oyster-women lock their fish up,"
5214,POSTSCRIPT.,"And trudge away to bawl, 'No bishop!'"""
5215,POSTSCRIPT.,
5216,POSTSCRIPT.,"Neither has it the deep pathos of the Spenserian stanza, which perhaps"
5217,POSTSCRIPT.,"strives at the deepest vein of poetry. Take two of Thomson's, for"
5218,POSTSCRIPT.,example:--
5219,POSTSCRIPT.,
5220,POSTSCRIPT.,"""O mortal man, who livest here by toil,"
5221,POSTSCRIPT.,Do not complain of this thy hard estate;
5222,POSTSCRIPT.,"That like an emmet thou must ever moil,"
5223,POSTSCRIPT.,Is a hard sentence of an ancient date:
5224,POSTSCRIPT.,"And, certes, there is for it reason great;"
5225,POSTSCRIPT.,"For though sometimes it makes thee weep and wail,"
5226,POSTSCRIPT.,"And curse thy star, and early drudge and late,"
5227,POSTSCRIPT.,"Withouten that would come a heavier bale,--"
5228,POSTSCRIPT.,"Loose life, unruly passions, and diseases pale."""
5229,POSTSCRIPT.,
5230,POSTSCRIPT.,And another stanza runs thus:--
5231,POSTSCRIPT.,
5232,POSTSCRIPT.,"""I care not, Fortune, what you me deny:"
5233,POSTSCRIPT.,You cannot rob me of free Nature's grace;
5234,POSTSCRIPT.,"You cannot shut the windows of the sky,"
5235,POSTSCRIPT.,Through which Aurora shows her brightening face;
5236,POSTSCRIPT.,You cannot bar my constant feet to trace
5237,POSTSCRIPT.,The woods and lawns by living stream at eve.
5238,POSTSCRIPT.,"Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,"
5239,POSTSCRIPT.,And I their toys to the great children leave;
5240,POSTSCRIPT.,"Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave."""
5241,POSTSCRIPT.,
5242,POSTSCRIPT.,"Such is the _stanza_ in which are written Spenser's 'Faërie Queen,'"
5243,POSTSCRIPT.,"Thomson's 'Castle of Indolence,' and Byron's 'Childe Harold,' and it is"
5244,POSTSCRIPT.,"the highest flight of poetry: after which comes the heroic verse, in"
5245,POSTSCRIPT.,which we lap the heavy poems we call epic--their Latin appellation; of
5246,POSTSCRIPT.,these the Iliads of Homer and the Æneids of Virgil are the ever
5247,POSTSCRIPT.,recurring aspirations of poets doomed to fall untimely. The charm of
5248,POSTSCRIPT.,"Homer is that it is not only a poem, but it instructs us in the"
5249,POSTSCRIPT.,history--all that we know of it--of those prehistoric days. It is full
5250,POSTSCRIPT.,"of ballads, which are the ground-work by which we trace the manners and"
5251,POSTSCRIPT.,the tenets of the pagan tribes. The truth involved in 'Homer' is the
5252,POSTSCRIPT.,"charm of his epic poem, while the falsehood involved in the 'Henriade'"
5253,POSTSCRIPT.,of Voltaire is amply sufficient to condemn it utterly. For a specimen
5254,POSTSCRIPT.,"let us take Pope's 'Homer,' where Hector answers Andromache's appeal to"
5255,POSTSCRIPT.,stay and guard the walls of Troy:--
5256,POSTSCRIPT.,
5257,POSTSCRIPT.,"""The chief replied, 'That post shall be my care;"
5258,POSTSCRIPT.,"Nor that alone, but all the works of war;"
5259,POSTSCRIPT.,"Still foremost let me stand to guard the throne,"
5260,POSTSCRIPT.,To save my father's honours and my own:
5261,POSTSCRIPT.,"Yet come it will, the day decreed by Fates--"
5262,POSTSCRIPT.,How my heart trembles whilst my tongue relates--
5263,POSTSCRIPT.,"That day when thou, imperial Troy, must bend,"
5264,POSTSCRIPT.,"Must see thy warriors fall, thy glories end."
5265,POSTSCRIPT.,And yet no presage dire so wounds my mind--
5266,POSTSCRIPT.,"My mother's death, the ruin of my kind--"
5267,POSTSCRIPT.,"As thine, Andromache, thy griefs I dread."
5268,POSTSCRIPT.,"I see thee weeping, trembling, captive led."
5269,POSTSCRIPT.,"In Argive looms our battles to design,"
5270,POSTSCRIPT.,Woes--of which woes so large a part was thine;
5271,POSTSCRIPT.,"To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring"
5272,POSTSCRIPT.,The waters from the Hypereian spring.
5273,POSTSCRIPT.,"There, whilst you groan beneath the load of life,"
5274,POSTSCRIPT.,"They cry ""Behold the Trojan Hector's wife!"""
5275,POSTSCRIPT.,"Some Argive, who shall live thy griefs to see,"
5276,POSTSCRIPT.,Embitters thy great woe by naming me:
5277,POSTSCRIPT.,"The thoughts of glory past and present shame,"
5278,POSTSCRIPT.,"A thousand griefs, shall waken at the name."
5279,POSTSCRIPT.,"May I lie cold before that dreadful day,"
5280,POSTSCRIPT.,Pressed by a load of monumental clay
5281,POSTSCRIPT.,"Thy Hector, wrapped in everlasting sleep,"
5282,POSTSCRIPT.,"Shall neither hear thee sigh nor see thee weep.'"""
5283,POSTSCRIPT.,
5284,POSTSCRIPT.,Next in pathos is the _mournful_ elegy; of which none can surpass Gray's
5285,POSTSCRIPT.,elegy:--
5286,POSTSCRIPT.,
5287,POSTSCRIPT.,"""The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,"
5288,POSTSCRIPT.,"And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,"
5289,POSTSCRIPT.,Alike await the inevitable hour;
5290,POSTSCRIPT.,The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
5291,POSTSCRIPT.,
5292,POSTSCRIPT.,Can storied urn or animated bust
5293,POSTSCRIPT.,Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
5294,POSTSCRIPT.,"Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust,"
5295,POSTSCRIPT.,Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death?
5296,POSTSCRIPT.,
5297,POSTSCRIPT.,Full many a gem of purest ray serene
5298,POSTSCRIPT.,The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
5299,POSTSCRIPT.,"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,"
5300,POSTSCRIPT.,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
5301,POSTSCRIPT.,
5302,POSTSCRIPT.,"Let not ambition mock our useful toil,"
5303,POSTSCRIPT.,"Our homely joys and destiny obscure,"
5304,POSTSCRIPT.,Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
5305,POSTSCRIPT.,The short and simple annals of the poor:
5306,POSTSCRIPT.,
5307,POSTSCRIPT.,"Their names, their years spelt by the untaught Muse,"
5308,POSTSCRIPT.,"The place of fame and elegy supply,"
5309,POSTSCRIPT.,"And many a holy text around she strews,"
5310,POSTSCRIPT.,"To teach the rustic moralist to die."""
5311,POSTSCRIPT.,
5312,POSTSCRIPT.,"Nursery rhymes, old ballads, odes, sonnets, epigrams, travesties,"
5313,POSTSCRIPT.,"fables, satires, and eclogues, and, most of all, songs, provide daily"
5314,POSTSCRIPT.,pleasure for us from our cradle to the grave. Every language has its
5315,POSTSCRIPT.,"nursery rhymes, which are a sort of Delphian lot, sung in enigma from"
5316,POSTSCRIPT.,"'King Pittacus of Mytilene' and 'Le bon Roi Dagobert,' to the lullaby of"
5317,POSTSCRIPT.,'Four-and-twenty Blackbirds.' There is as much sarcasm in nursery rhymes
5318,POSTSCRIPT.,as there is of pride and boast in the songs of bards at the feast of
5319,POSTSCRIPT.,"heroes, and as there is of humble confession in the funeral psalm. Song"
5320,POSTSCRIPT.,"tends alike to evaporate exuberant spirits, and to soothe the soul in an"
5321,POSTSCRIPT.,affliction--as Desdemona informs us so sweetly in her misery:--
5322,POSTSCRIPT.,
5323,POSTSCRIPT.,"""My mother had a maid called Barbara;"
5324,POSTSCRIPT.,"She was in love: and he she loved proved mad,"
5325,POSTSCRIPT.,"And did forsake her. She had a song of willow,"
5326,POSTSCRIPT.,"An old thing 'twas; but it expressed her fortune,"
5327,POSTSCRIPT.,And she died singing it. That song to-night
5328,POSTSCRIPT.,"Will not go from my mind: I have much to do,"
5329,POSTSCRIPT.,"But to go hang my head all of one side,"
5330,POSTSCRIPT.,"And sing it like poor Barbara."""
5331,POSTSCRIPT.,
5332,POSTSCRIPT.,"Ophelia chanted as she floated down the brook, Arion tamed the flood,"
5333,POSTSCRIPT.,and Orpheus the trees and rocks. It is a marvellous power which soothes
5334,POSTSCRIPT.,"alike the babe in the arms and the hero at the feast, the lover and the"
5335,POSTSCRIPT.,"forsaken maiden, which leads to battle and returns from conquest;"
5336,POSTSCRIPT.,"therefore let us see the ODE, in 'Eton Revisited':--"
5337,POSTSCRIPT.,
5338,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Ah, happy hills! ah, pleasing shade!"
5339,POSTSCRIPT.,"Ah, fields beloved in vain!"
5340,POSTSCRIPT.,Where once my careless boyhood strayed
5341,POSTSCRIPT.,A stranger yet to pain.
5342,POSTSCRIPT.,I feel the gales that from ye blow
5343,POSTSCRIPT.,"A momentary bliss bestow,"
5344,POSTSCRIPT.,As waving fresh their gladsome wing
5345,POSTSCRIPT.,"My weary soul they seem to soothe,"
5346,POSTSCRIPT.,"And redolent of joy and youth,"
5347,POSTSCRIPT.,To breathe a second spring.
5348,POSTSCRIPT.,
5349,POSTSCRIPT.,Whilst some on earnest labour bent
5350,POSTSCRIPT.,"Their business, murmuring, ply"
5351,POSTSCRIPT.,'Gainst graver hours that bring constraint
5352,POSTSCRIPT.,To sweeten liberty;
5353,POSTSCRIPT.,Some bold adventurers disdain
5354,POSTSCRIPT.,The limits of the little reign
5355,POSTSCRIPT.,And unknown regions dare descry;
5356,POSTSCRIPT.,"Still as they run they look behind,"
5357,POSTSCRIPT.,"And hear a voice in every wind,"
5358,POSTSCRIPT.,And snatch a fearful joy.
5359,POSTSCRIPT.,
5360,POSTSCRIPT.,"To each his sufferings, all are men"
5361,POSTSCRIPT.,Condemned alike to groan;
5362,POSTSCRIPT.,"The tender, for another's pain--"
5363,POSTSCRIPT.,"The unfeeling, for his own."
5364,POSTSCRIPT.,"Yet, ah! why should they know their fate,"
5365,POSTSCRIPT.,Since sorrow never comes too late;
5366,POSTSCRIPT.,And happiness too swiftly flies?
5367,POSTSCRIPT.,Thought would destroy their paradise.
5368,POSTSCRIPT.,"No more: 'where ignorance is bliss,"
5369,POSTSCRIPT.,"'Tis folly to be wise.'"""
5370,POSTSCRIPT.,
5371,POSTSCRIPT.,"Let me add four lines from Denham's poem, 'On Cooper's Hill,' addressing"
5372,POSTSCRIPT.,the River Thames:--
5373,POSTSCRIPT.,
5374,POSTSCRIPT.,"""O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream"
5375,POSTSCRIPT.,"My great example, as it is my theme!"
5376,POSTSCRIPT.,"Though deep yet clear, though gentle yet not dull,"
5377,POSTSCRIPT.,"Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full."""
5378,POSTSCRIPT.,
5379,POSTSCRIPT.,Our old ballads are very fine: the opening of 'Chevy Chase' is equal to
5380,POSTSCRIPT.,"'Wrath, Goddess sing the Wrath of Achilles,' or 'Arms and the Man:'--"
5381,POSTSCRIPT.,
5382,POSTSCRIPT.,"""The Persé owt of Northumberland,"
5383,POSTSCRIPT.,"And a vowe to Godde made he,"
5384,POSTSCRIPT.,That he would hunt in the mountains
5385,POSTSCRIPT.,Of Cheviot within days three.
5386,POSTSCRIPT.,In maugre of doughty Douglas
5387,POSTSCRIPT.,"And all that ever with him be,"
5388,POSTSCRIPT.,"The fattest hartes in all Cheviot,"
5389,POSTSCRIPT.,"He said, to kill and bear away."
5390,POSTSCRIPT.,"'By my faith!' quoth the doughty Douglas then,"
5391,POSTSCRIPT.,"'I will lette that hunting, gif I may.'"
5392,POSTSCRIPT.,
5393,POSTSCRIPT.,Worde is commen to Eddenburrowe
5394,POSTSCRIPT.,"To James, the Scottish King,"
5395,POSTSCRIPT.,"That doughty Douglas, Lyfftenant of Marches,"
5396,POSTSCRIPT.,Lay slain Chevyot hills within.
5397,POSTSCRIPT.,"His handdes did James weal and wryng,"
5398,POSTSCRIPT.,"Sighing, 'Alas! and woe is me--"
5399,POSTSCRIPT.,Such another captain Scotland within
5400,POSTSCRIPT.,I trow there will never be!'
5401,POSTSCRIPT.,Worde is commen to lovely Londone
5402,POSTSCRIPT.,"Till the fourth Harry, our King,"
5403,POSTSCRIPT.,"That Lord Persé, Lyfftenant of Marches,"
5404,POSTSCRIPT.,Lay slain Cheviot hills within.
5405,POSTSCRIPT.,"'God have mercy on his soul!' said Kyng Harry,"
5406,POSTSCRIPT.,"'Good Lord, if thy will it be."
5407,POSTSCRIPT.,I have a hondrith Captains in Englonde
5408,POSTSCRIPT.,As good as ever was he;
5409,POSTSCRIPT.,"But Persé, and I brook my lyffe"
5410,POSTSCRIPT.,Thy death well quit shall be.'
5411,POSTSCRIPT.,This was the honting off the Cheviot
5412,POSTSCRIPT.,'That tear beganne this spurn:'
5413,POSTSCRIPT.,Old men that known the ground well enough
5414,POSTSCRIPT.,Call it the battle of Otterburn.
5415,POSTSCRIPT.,At Otterburn began this spurn
5416,POSTSCRIPT.,Upon a Monnynday;
5417,POSTSCRIPT.,"There was the doughtie Douglas slain,"
5418,POSTSCRIPT.,"The Persé went captive away."""
5419,POSTSCRIPT.,
5420,POSTSCRIPT.,But of every species of poetry none are so rife with life and beauty as
5421,POSTSCRIPT.,"the song. It conjoins music with words, and brevity with sweetness."
5422,POSTSCRIPT.,"There is no position in which man does not sing,--in joy to express it,"
5423,POSTSCRIPT.,"and in woe to relieve it: in company in chorus, and alone for"
5424,POSTSCRIPT.,companionship. Sir Walter Scott has imagined the minstrel to sing:--
5425,POSTSCRIPT.,
5426,POSTSCRIPT.,"""I have song of war for knight,"
5427,POSTSCRIPT.,"Lay of love for ladye bright,"
5428,POSTSCRIPT.,"Fairie tale to lull the heir,"
5429,POSTSCRIPT.,Goblin grim the maid to scare.
5430,POSTSCRIPT.,"If you pity kith or kin,"
5431,POSTSCRIPT.,"Take the wandering harper in."""
5432,POSTSCRIPT.,
5433,POSTSCRIPT.,"But songs are like the flowers of the field: each age hath its own,"
5434,POSTSCRIPT.,"which fade and perish and make way for another crop, and every age"
5435,POSTSCRIPT.,"claims its own. For melody, terseness, and beauty of words, the song"
5436,POSTSCRIPT.,excels more than any other form of poetry; and they are wise who have a
5437,POSTSCRIPT.,"private collection of the songs which, like swallows, come and"
5438,POSTSCRIPT.,disappear.
5439,POSTSCRIPT.,
5440,POSTSCRIPT.,"It may appear strange to print the Fables of Gay, and say no word of our"
5441,POSTSCRIPT.,author; but the truth is that it is unkind to withdraw the veil of
5442,POSTSCRIPT.,privacy from any man's life. Doctor Johnson did an unkind deed when he
5443,POSTSCRIPT.,wrote the 'Lives of the Poets;' for which he was fully repaid when
5444,POSTSCRIPT.,"Boswell flayed him bare as ever Apollo flayed Marsyas, and exposed all"
5445,POSTSCRIPT.,"the quivering nerves to the light of day. Of all classes of men, the"
5446,POSTSCRIPT.,class of poets most need the concealing veil: the greatest have been
5447,POSTSCRIPT.,"blind; the next greatest halt, and the remainder weak or deformed of"
5448,POSTSCRIPT.,"frame. Debarred the healthier paths of life, man rushes for employment"
5449,POSTSCRIPT.,"to the refuging muse; and rightly so, for he finds an employment"
5450,POSTSCRIPT.,ornamental and useful still. But solitude does not nurture the virtues
5451,POSTSCRIPT.,"of the soul more than physical defect does that of the body, and the"
5452,POSTSCRIPT.,withdrawal of the curtain divulges a very sad sight of discontent and
5453,POSTSCRIPT.,envy. Homer himself is recorded to have ejaculated his aspiration to be
5454,POSTSCRIPT.,the favourite of the Greek girls and boys. A poet seer loves no brother
5455,POSTSCRIPT.,"near his throne, and is but too apt to complain of non-appreciation of"
5456,POSTSCRIPT.,his muse on the part of the world. The fault rather is in their own too
5457,POSTSCRIPT.,sensitive souls; and it is a fact that there is scarcely a name in the
5458,POSTSCRIPT.,"roll of poets, whose fame is not harmed by divulging his exotic life."
5459,POSTSCRIPT.,The rural labourer's fate--
5460,POSTSCRIPT.,
5461,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Where to be born and die,"
5462,POSTSCRIPT.,"Of rich and poor, make all the history""--"
5463,POSTSCRIPT.,
5464,POSTSCRIPT.,"is far better than to be paraded from the disobedience of youth, the"
5465,POSTSCRIPT.,"rebellion of manhood, and the disappointment of age, divulged in the"
5466,POSTSCRIPT.,storied lives of the few hundred names admitted to be British poets; and
5467,POSTSCRIPT.,"the reading of whose works is, as a rule, a task of weariness. The"
5468,POSTSCRIPT.,career of Gay is a very fair one as an average of the poetic. He mainly
5469,POSTSCRIPT.,avoided the enumerated ills--enumerated by Dr. Johnson--
5470,POSTSCRIPT.,
5471,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail."""
5472,POSTSCRIPT.,
5473,POSTSCRIPT.,"The poetic element in Britain was very strong in the days of Gay. Pope,"
5474,POSTSCRIPT.,"Swift, Prior, Addison were the petted servants of the Ministers. They"
5475,POSTSCRIPT.,"were all far more successful in their careers than was Gay, who from his"
5476,POSTSCRIPT.,boyhood refused to labour for his bread. Very early he found a patroness
5477,POSTSCRIPT.,"in the Duchess of Monmouth, who had"
5478,POSTSCRIPT.,
5479,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Wept over Monmouth's bloody tomb,"""
5480,POSTSCRIPT.,
5481,POSTSCRIPT.,with whom he enjoyed a sort of honorary post--secretary to the shadow
5482,POSTSCRIPT.,"of a princess; next he became a real secretary to the Earl of Clarendon,"
5483,POSTSCRIPT.,"Ambassador at Hanover, as Prior had been to the Ambassador at Paris. We"
5484,POSTSCRIPT.,"easily trace in Gay's career the unsatisfied overweening poetic soul,"
5485,POSTSCRIPT.,"like a Charybdis, insatiable of adulation. In 1716, the Earl of"
5486,POSTSCRIPT.,"Burlington cheered him at his seat in Devon; in 1717, he accompanied Mr."
5487,POSTSCRIPT.,"Pulteney to Aix; in 1718, Lord Harcourt soothed his spirits. Then he"
5488,POSTSCRIPT.,"made money, which burnt holes in his pockets. He called his friends"
5489,POSTSCRIPT.,"together, to ask how he should invest. His poetic friends Pope and Swift"
5490,POSTSCRIPT.,advised him to sink it in an annuity. But fate or fortune cast him in
5491,POSTSCRIPT.,"with Secretary Craggs and the South Sea scheme, and, from the possessor"
5492,POSTSCRIPT.,"of 20,000_l._, his capital collapsed to _nil_. In vain he had been"
5493,POSTSCRIPT.,"bidden to sell and to realize. He had visions of wealth, and held on to"
5494,POSTSCRIPT.,be accidentally an honester man than if he had enriched himself by that
5495,POSTSCRIPT.,"delusive scheme; but he nearly sunk beneath his disappointment, and his"
5496,POSTSCRIPT.,health was endangered. Hope and the Muse restored him to more life and
5497,POSTSCRIPT.,"to more disappointment. He then wrote 'The Captive,' obtained an"
5498,POSTSCRIPT.,"appointment to read it to the Princess of Wales, stumbled, like Cæsar,"
5499,POSTSCRIPT.,"over a stool; the princess screamed, the omen was a true one--'The"
5500,POSTSCRIPT.,Captive' pined and died.
5501,POSTSCRIPT.,
5502,POSTSCRIPT.,"In 1726 he wrote these Fables, dedicating them to the Duke of"
5503,POSTSCRIPT.,"Cumberland, and in 1727 his royal patron succeeded to the crown; when he"
5504,POSTSCRIPT.,was offered the post of Gentleman Usher to the Princess Louisa. Gay was
5505,POSTSCRIPT.,"hurt and indignant, and made court to Mrs. Howard (afterwards Countess"
5506,POSTSCRIPT.,"of Suffolk), one of the anomalous favourites alluded to in page 131, but"
5507,POSTSCRIPT.,in vain.
5508,POSTSCRIPT.,
5509,POSTSCRIPT.,"Then came the great success of his 'Beggars' Opera,' which was followed"
5510,POSTSCRIPT.,"by 'Polly,' its sequel. 'Polly' was forbidden by the Lord Chamberlain,"
5511,POSTSCRIPT.,and a private subscription raised 1200_l._ to recompense Gay for not
5512,POSTSCRIPT.,"being suffered to please the mob with his immorality. And, lastly, the"
5513,POSTSCRIPT.,Duke and Duchess of Queensberry took this child of nature by the
5514,POSTSCRIPT.,"hand--the duke to manage his worldly substance, and the duchess to"
5515,POSTSCRIPT.,"soothe his insatiable vanity--and so he died at the early age of 45, and"
5516,POSTSCRIPT.,"has a very pretty tomb, with ""Queensberry weeping o'er his urn,"" in"
5517,POSTSCRIPT.,Poets' Corner. Pope's epitaph runs thus:--
5518,POSTSCRIPT.,
5519,POSTSCRIPT.,"""Blest be the gods for those they took away,"
5520,POSTSCRIPT.,"And those they left me, for they left me Gay."
5521,POSTSCRIPT.,"Left me to see deserted genius bloom,"
5522,POSTSCRIPT.,"Neglected die, and tell it on his tomb;"
5523,POSTSCRIPT.,Of all his blameless life the sole return
5524,POSTSCRIPT.,"My verse and Queensberry weeping o'er his urn."""
5525,POSTSCRIPT.,
5526,POSTSCRIPT.,"Peace with his dust! Another couplet of Pope's, methinks, has more of"
5527,POSTSCRIPT.,moral truth and justice:--
5528,POSTSCRIPT.,
5529,POSTSCRIPT.,"""A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod;"
5530,POSTSCRIPT.,"An honest man's the noblest work of God."""
