121,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
122,INTRODUCTION,
123,INTRODUCTION,
124,INTRODUCTION,"The purpose of this Collection is to put before children, and young"
125,INTRODUCTION,"people, poems which are good in themselves, and especially fitted to"
126,INTRODUCTION,"live, as Theocritus says, 'on the lips of the young.' The Editor has"
127,INTRODUCTION,"been guided to a great extent, in making his choice, by recollections"
128,INTRODUCTION,"of what particularly pleased himself in youth. As a rule, the beginner"
129,INTRODUCTION,in poetry likes what is called 'objective' art--verse with a story in
130,INTRODUCTION,"it, the more vigorous the story the better. The old ballads satisfy"
131,INTRODUCTION,"this taste, and the Editor would gladly have added more of them, but"
132,INTRODUCTION,"for two reasons. First, there are parents who would see harm, where"
133,INTRODUCTION,"children see none, in 'Tamlane' and 'Clerk Saunders.' Next, there was"
134,INTRODUCTION,reason to dread that the volume might become entirely too Scottish. It
135,INTRODUCTION,"is certainly a curious thing that, in Mr. Palgrave's _Golden Treasury_,"
136,INTRODUCTION,"where some seventy poets are represented, scarcely more than a tenth of"
137,INTRODUCTION,"the number were born north of Tweed. In this book, however, intended"
138,INTRODUCTION,"for lads and lassies, the poems by Campbell, by Sir Walter Scott, by"
139,INTRODUCTION,"Burns, by the Scottish song-writers, and the Scottish minstrels of the"
140,INTRODUCTION,"ballad, are in an unexpectedly large proportion to the poems by English"
141,INTRODUCTION,authors. The Editor believes that this predominance of Northern verse
142,INTRODUCTION,is not due to any exorbitant local patriotism of his own. The singers
143,INTRODUCTION,"of the North, for some reason or other, do excel in poems of action"
144,INTRODUCTION,"and of adventure, or to him they seem to excel. He is acquainted with"
145,INTRODUCTION,"no modern ballad by a Southern Englishman, setting aside 'Christabel'"
146,INTRODUCTION,and the 'Ancient Mariner--' poems hardly to be called ballads--which
147,INTRODUCTION,equals 'The Eve of St. John.' For spirit-stirring martial strains few
148,INTRODUCTION,"Englishmen since Drayton have been rivals of Campbell, of Scott, of"
149,INTRODUCTION,"Burns, of Hogg with his song of 'Donald McDonald.' Two names, indeed,"
150,INTRODUCTION,might be mentioned here: the names of the late Sir Francis Doyle and
151,INTRODUCTION,of Lord Tennyson. But the scheme of this book excludes a choice from
152,INTRODUCTION,contemporary poets. It is not necessary to dwell on the reasons for
153,INTRODUCTION,this decision. But the Editor believes that some anthologist of the
154,INTRODUCTION,"future will find in the poetry of living English authors, or of English"
155,INTRODUCTION,"authors recently dead, a very considerable garden of that kind of verse"
156,INTRODUCTION,which is good both for young and old. To think for a moment of this
157,INTRODUCTION,abundance is to conceive more highly of Victorian poetry. There must
158,INTRODUCTION,"still, after all, be youth and mettle in the nation which could produce"
159,INTRODUCTION,"'The Ballad of the Revenge,' 'Lucknow,' 'The Red Thread of Honour,'"
160,INTRODUCTION,"'The Loss of the Birkenhead,' 'The Forsaken Merman,' 'How they brought"
161,INTRODUCTION,"the Good News from Ghent to Aix,' 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin,' and many"
162,INTRODUCTION,"a song of Charles Kingley's, not to mention here the work of still"
163,INTRODUCTION,later authors. But we only glean the fields of men long dead.
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,"For this reason, then--namely, because certain admirable contemporary"
166,INTRODUCTION,"poems, like 'Lucknow' and 'The Red Thread of Honour,' are unavoidably"
167,INTRODUCTION,"excluded--the poems of action, of war, of adventure, chance to be"
168,INTRODUCTION,mainly from Scottish hands. Thus Campbell and Scott may seem to hold
169,INTRODUCTION,a pre-eminence which would not have been so marked had the works of
170,INTRODUCTION,"living poets, or of poets recently dead, been available. Yet in any"
171,INTRODUCTION,circumstances these authors must have occupied a great deal of the
172,INTRODUCTION,field: Campbell for the vigour which the unfriendly Leyden had to
173,INTRODUCTION,"recognise; Scott for that Homeric quality which, since Homer, no man"
174,INTRODUCTION,has displayed in the same degree. Extracts from his long poems do
175,INTRODUCTION,"not come within the scope of this selection. But, estimated even by"
176,INTRODUCTION,"his lyrics, Scott seems, to the Editor, to justify his right, now"
177,INTRODUCTION,"occasionally disdained, to rank among the great poets of his country."
178,INTRODUCTION,"He has music, speed, and gaiety, as in 'The Hunting Song' or in 'Nora's"
179,INTRODUCTION,Vow:'
180,INTRODUCTION,
181,INTRODUCTION,"For all the gold, for all the gear,"
182,INTRODUCTION,For all the lands both far and near
183,INTRODUCTION,"That ever valour lost or won,"
184,INTRODUCTION,I would not wed the Earlie's son!
185,INTRODUCTION,
186,INTRODUCTION,"Lines like these sing themselves naturally in a child's memory, while"
187,INTRODUCTION,there is a woodland freshness and a daring note in
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,"O, Brignall banks are wild and fair,"
190,INTRODUCTION,And Greta woods are green.
191,INTRODUCTION,
192,INTRODUCTION,"'Young Lochinvar' goes 'as dauntingly as wantonly' to his bridal, as"
193,INTRODUCTION,"the heir of Macpherson's Rant to his death, in a wonderful swing and"
194,INTRODUCTION,"gallop of verse; while still, out of dim years of childhood far away,"
195,INTRODUCTION,one hears how all the bells are ringing in Dunfermline town for the
196,INTRODUCTION,"wedding of Alice Brand. From childhood, too, one remembers the quietism"
197,INTRODUCTION,"of Lucy Ashton's song, and the monotone of the measure--"
198,INTRODUCTION,
199,INTRODUCTION,"Vacant heart and hand and eye,"
200,INTRODUCTION,Easy live and quiet die.
201,INTRODUCTION,
202,INTRODUCTION,The wisdom of it is as perceptible to a child as that other lesson of
203,INTRODUCTION,"Scott's, which rings like a clarion:"
204,INTRODUCTION,
205,INTRODUCTION,To all the sensual world proclaim
206,INTRODUCTION,One glorious hour of crowded life
207,INTRODUCTION,Is worth an age without a name.
208,INTRODUCTION,
209,INTRODUCTION,"Then there are his martial pieces, as the 'Gathering Song of Donald"
210,INTRODUCTION,"Dhu' and 'The Cavalier,' and there is the inimitable simplicity and"
211,INTRODUCTION,"sadness of 'Proud Maisie,' like the dirge for Clearista by Meleager,"
212,INTRODUCTION,"but with a deeper tone, a stronger magic; and there is the song, which"
213,INTRODUCTION,"the Fates might sing in a Greek chorus, the song which Meg Merrilies"
214,INTRODUCTION,"sang,"
215,INTRODUCTION,
216,INTRODUCTION,"Twist ye, twine ye, even so!"
217,INTRODUCTION,
218,INTRODUCTION,"These are but a few examples of Scott's variety, his spontaneity, his"
219,INTRODUCTION,"hardly conscious mastery of his art. Like Phemius of Ithaca, he might"
220,INTRODUCTION,"say 'none has taught me but myself, and the God has put into my heart"
221,INTRODUCTION,all manner of lays'--all but the conscious and elaborate 'manner of
222,INTRODUCTION,"lays,' which has now such power over some young critics that they talk"
223,INTRODUCTION,of Scott's redeeming his bad verse by his good novels. The taste of
224,INTRODUCTION,childhood and of maturity is simpler and more pure.
225,INTRODUCTION,
226,INTRODUCTION,"In the development of a love of poetry it is probable that simple,"
227,INTRODUCTION,"natural, and adventurous poetry like Scott's comes first, and that"
228,INTRODUCTION,it is followed later--followed but not superseded--by admiration of
229,INTRODUCTION,"such reflective poetry as is plain and even obvious, like that of"
230,INTRODUCTION,"Longfellow, from whom a number of examples are given. But, to the"
231,INTRODUCTION,"Editor at least, it seems that a child who cares for poetry is hardly"
232,INTRODUCTION,"ever too young to delight in mere beauty of words, in the music of"
233,INTRODUCTION,"metre and rhyme, even when the meaning is perhaps still obscure and"
234,INTRODUCTION,"little considered. A child, one is convinced, would take great pleasure"
235,INTRODUCTION,"in Mr. Swinburne's choruses in 'Atalanta,' such as"
236,INTRODUCTION,
237,INTRODUCTION,"Before the beginning of years,"
238,INTRODUCTION,
239,INTRODUCTION,and in Shelley's 'Cloud' and his 'Arethusa.' For this reason a number
240,INTRODUCTION,"of pieces of Edgar Poe's are given, and we have not shrunk even from"
241,INTRODUCTION,"including the faulty 'Ulalume,' because of the mere sound of it, apart"
242,INTRODUCTION,from the sense. The three most famous poems of Coleridge may be above
243,INTRODUCTION,"a child's full comprehension, but they lead him into a world not"
244,INTRODUCTION,"realised, 'an unsubstantial fairy place,' bright in a morning mist,"
245,INTRODUCTION,like our memories of childhood.
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,"It is probably later, in most lives, that the mind wakens to delight"
248,INTRODUCTION,"in the less obvious magic of style, and the less ringing, the more"
249,INTRODUCTION,intimate melody of poets like Keats and Lord Tennyson. The songs of
250,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare, of course, are for all ages, and the needs of youth"
251,INTRODUCTION,"comparatively mature are met in Dryden's 'Ode on Alexander's Feast,'"
252,INTRODUCTION,and in 'Lycidas' and the 'Hymn for the Nativity.'
253,INTRODUCTION,
254,INTRODUCTION,"It does not appear to the Editor that poems about children, or"
255,INTRODUCTION,"especially intended for children, are those which a child likes best."
256,INTRODUCTION,"A child's imaginative life is much spent in the unknown future, and in"
257,INTRODUCTION,"the romantic past. He is the contemporary of Leonidas, of Agincourt, of"
258,INTRODUCTION,"Bannockburn, of the '45; he is living in an heroic age of his own, in"
259,INTRODUCTION,a Phæacia where the Gods walk visibly. The poems written for and about
260,INTRODUCTION,"children, like Blake's and some of Wordsworth's, rather appeal to the"
261,INTRODUCTION,"old, whose own childhood is now to them a distant fairy world, as the"
262,INTRODUCTION,man's life is to the child. The Editor can remember having been more
263,INTRODUCTION,"mystified and puzzled by 'Lucy Gray' than by the 'Eve of St. John,'"
264,INTRODUCTION,"at a very early age. He is convinced that Blake's 'Nurse's Song,' for"
265,INTRODUCTION,"example, which brings back to him the long, the endless evenings of"
266,INTRODUCTION,"the Northern summer, when one had to go to bed while the hills beyond"
267,INTRODUCTION,"Ettrick were still clear in the silver light, speaks more intimately"
268,INTRODUCTION,"to the grown man than to the little boy or girl. Hood's 'I remember, I"
269,INTRODUCTION,"remember,' in the same way, brings in the burden of reflection on that"
270,INTRODUCTION,"which the child cannot possibly reflect upon--namely, a childhood which"
271,INTRODUCTION,is past. There is the same tone in Mr. Stevenson's 'Child's Garden of
272,INTRODUCTION,"Verse,' which can hardly be read without tears--tears that do not come"
273,INTRODUCTION,"and should not come to the eyes of childhood. For, beyond the child and"
274,INTRODUCTION,his actual experience of the world as the ballads and poems of battle
275,INTRODUCTION,"are, he can forecast the years, and anticipate the passions. What he"
276,INTRODUCTION,"cannot anticipate is his own age, himself, his pleasures and griefs, as"
277,INTRODUCTION,"the grown man sees them in memory, and with a sympathy for the thing"
278,INTRODUCTION,"that he has been, and can never be again. It is his excursions into"
279,INTRODUCTION,"the untravelled world which the child enjoys, and this is what makes"
280,INTRODUCTION,Shakespeare so dear to him--Shakespeare who has written so little
281,INTRODUCTION,on childhood. In _The Midsummer Night's Dream_ the child can lose
282,INTRODUCTION,"himself in a world familiar to him, in the fairy age, and can derive"
283,INTRODUCTION,"such pleasure from Puck, or from Ariel, as his later taste can scarce"
284,INTRODUCTION,"recover in the same measure. Falstaff is his playfellow, 'a child's"
285,INTRODUCTION,"Falstaff, an innocent creature,' as Dickens says of Tom Jones in _David"
286,INTRODUCTION,Copperfield_.
287,INTRODUCTION,
288,INTRODUCTION,"A boy prefers the wild Prince and Poins to Barbara Lewthwaite, the"
289,INTRODUCTION,little girl who moralised to the lamb. We make a mistake when we 'write
290,INTRODUCTION,down' to children; still more do we err when we tell a child not to
291,INTRODUCTION,read this or that because he cannot understand it. He understands
292,INTRODUCTION,"far more than we give him credit for, but nothing that can harm him."
293,INTRODUCTION,"The half-understanding of it, too, the sense of a margin beyond, as"
294,INTRODUCTION,"in a wood full of unknown glades, and birds, and flowers unfamiliar,"
295,INTRODUCTION,is great part of a child's pleasure in reading. For this reason many
296,INTRODUCTION,poems are included here in which the Editor does not suppose that the
297,INTRODUCTION,readers will be able to pass an examination. For another reason a few
298,INTRODUCTION,pieces of no great excellence as poetry are included. Though they may
299,INTRODUCTION,"appear full of obviousness to us, there is an age of dawning reflection"
300,INTRODUCTION,"to which they are not obvious. Longfellow, especially, seems to the"
301,INTRODUCTION,Editor to be a kind of teacher to bring readers to the more reflective
302,INTRODUCTION,"poetry of Wordsworth, while he has a sort of simple charm in which"
303,INTRODUCTION,there is a foretaste of the charm of Tennyson and Keats. But everyone
304,INTRODUCTION,who attempts to make such a collection must inevitably be guided by
305,INTRODUCTION,"his own recollections of childhood, of his childish likings, and the"
306,INTRODUCTION,development of the love of poetry in himself. We have really no other
307,INTRODUCTION,"criterion, for children are such kind and good-natured critics that"
308,INTRODUCTION,"they will take pleasure in whatever is given or read to them, and it is"
309,INTRODUCTION,hard for us to discern where the pleasure is keenest and most natural.
310,INTRODUCTION,
311,INTRODUCTION,The Editor trusts that this book may be a guide into romance and
312,INTRODUCTION,"fairyland to many children. Of a child's enthusiasm for poetry, and"
313,INTRODUCTION,"the life which he leads by himself in poetry, it is very difficult to"
314,INTRODUCTION,"speak. Words cannot easily bring back the pleasure of it, now discerned"
315,INTRODUCTION,"in the far past like a dream, full of witchery, and music, and"
316,INTRODUCTION,"adventure. Some children, perhaps the majority, are of such a nature"
317,INTRODUCTION,"that they weave this dream for themselves, out of their own imaginings,"
318,INTRODUCTION,"with no aid or with little aid from the poets. Others, possibly less"
319,INTRODUCTION,"imaginative, if more bookish, gladly accept the poet's help, and"
320,INTRODUCTION,are his most flattering readers. There are moments in that remote
321,INTRODUCTION,"life which remain always vividly present to memory, as when first we"
322,INTRODUCTION,"followed the chase with Fitz-James, or first learned how 'The Baron of"
323,INTRODUCTION,"Smaylho'me rose with day,' or first heard how"
324,INTRODUCTION,
325,INTRODUCTION,All day long the noise of battle roll'd
326,INTRODUCTION,Among the mountains by the winter sea.
327,INTRODUCTION,
328,INTRODUCTION,Almost the happiest of such moments were those lulled by the sleepy
329,INTRODUCTION,"music of 'The Castle of Indolence,' a poem now perhaps seldom read, at"
330,INTRODUCTION,least by the young. Yet they may do worse than visit the drowsy castle
331,INTRODUCTION,of him who wrote
332,INTRODUCTION,
333,INTRODUCTION,So when a shepherd of the Hebrid isles
334,INTRODUCTION,Placed far amid the melancholy main.
335,INTRODUCTION,
336,INTRODUCTION,Childhood is the age when a love of poetry may be born and
337,INTRODUCTION,"strengthened--a taste which grows rarer and more rare in our age, when"
338,INTRODUCTION,examinations spring up and choke the good seed. By way of lending no
339,INTRODUCTION,"aid to what is called Education, very few notes have been added. The"
340,INTRODUCTION,child does not want everything to be explained; in the unexplained
341,INTRODUCTION,"is great pleasure. Nothing, perhaps, crushes the love of poetry more"
342,INTRODUCTION,surely and swiftly than the use of poems as school-books. They are
343,INTRODUCTION,"at once associated in the mind with lessons, with long, with endless"
344,INTRODUCTION,"hours in school, with puzzling questions and the agony of an imperfect"
345,INTRODUCTION,"memory, with grammar and etymology, and everything that is the enemy"
346,INTRODUCTION,of joy. We may cause children to hate Shakespeare or Spenser as Byron
347,INTRODUCTION,"hated Horace, by inflicting poets on them, not for their poetry, but"
348,INTRODUCTION,"for the valuable information in the notes. This danger, at least, it is"
349,INTRODUCTION,not difficult to avoid in the _Blue Poetry Book_.

1584,_JOHN GILPIN_,O'erjoy'd was he to find
1585,_JOHN GILPIN_,"That though on pleasure she was bent,"
1586,_JOHN GILPIN_,She had a frugal mind.
1587,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1588,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The morning came, the chaise was brought,"
1589,_JOHN GILPIN_,But yet was not allow'd
1590,_JOHN GILPIN_,"To drive up to the door, lest all"
1591,_JOHN GILPIN_,Should say that she was proud.
1592,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1593,_JOHN GILPIN_,"So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,"
1594,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Where they did all get in,"
1595,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Six precious souls, and all agog"
1596,_JOHN GILPIN_,To dash through thick and thin.
1597,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1598,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Smack went the whip, round went the wheels;"
1599,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Were never folks so glad,"
1600,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The stones did rattle underneath,"
1601,_JOHN GILPIN_,As if Cheapside were mad.
1602,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1603,_JOHN GILPIN_,"John Gilpin at his horse's side,"
1604,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Seized fast the flowing mane,"
1605,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And up he got in haste to ride,"
1606,_JOHN GILPIN_,But soon came down again.
1607,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1608,_JOHN GILPIN_,"For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,"
1609,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His journey to begin,"
1610,_JOHN GILPIN_,When turning round his head he saw
1611,_JOHN GILPIN_,Three customers come in.
1612,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1613,_JOHN GILPIN_,"So down he came, for loss of time"
1614,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Although it grieved him sore,"
1615,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,"
1616,_JOHN GILPIN_,Would trouble him much more.
1617,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1618,_JOHN GILPIN_,'Twas long before the customers
1619,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Were suited to their mind,"
1620,_JOHN GILPIN_,"When Betty screaming came downstairs,"
1621,_JOHN GILPIN_,The wine is left behind.
1622,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1623,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,"
1624,_JOHN GILPIN_,My leathern belt likewise
1625,_JOHN GILPIN_,In which I bear my trusty sword
1626,_JOHN GILPIN_,When I do exercise.
1627,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1628,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,"
1629,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Had two stone bottles found,"
1630,_JOHN GILPIN_,"To hold the liquor that she loved,"
1631,_JOHN GILPIN_,And keep it safe and sound.
1632,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1633,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Each bottle had a curling ear,"
1634,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Through which the belt he drew,"
1635,_JOHN GILPIN_,And hung a bottle on each side
1636,_JOHN GILPIN_,To make his balance true.
1637,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1638,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Then over all, that he might be"
1639,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Equipp'd from top to toe,"
1640,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His long red cloak well-brush'd and neat,"
1641,_JOHN GILPIN_,He manfully did throw.
1642,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1643,_JOHN GILPIN_,Now see him mounted once again
1644,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Upon his nimble steed,"
1645,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,"
1646,_JOHN GILPIN_,With caution and good heed.
1647,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1648,_JOHN GILPIN_,But finding soon a smoother road
1649,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Beneath his well-shod feet,"
1650,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The snorting beast began to trot,"
1651,_JOHN GILPIN_,Which gall'd him in his seat.
1652,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1653,_JOHN GILPIN_,"So, Fair and softly! John he cried,"
1654,_JOHN GILPIN_,But John he cried in vain;
1655,_JOHN GILPIN_,"That trot became a gallop soon,"
1656,_JOHN GILPIN_,In spite of curb and rein.
1657,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1658,_JOHN GILPIN_,"So stooping down, as needs he must"
1659,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Who cannot sit upright,"
1660,_JOHN GILPIN_,He grasp'd the mane with both his hands
1661,_JOHN GILPIN_,And eke with all his might.
1662,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1663,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His horse, who never in that sort"
1664,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Had handled been before,"
1665,_JOHN GILPIN_,What thing upon his back had got
1666,_JOHN GILPIN_,Did wonder more and more.
1667,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1668,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Away went Gilpin neck or nought,"
1669,_JOHN GILPIN_,Away went hat and wig;
1670,_JOHN GILPIN_,"He little dreamt, when he set out,"
1671,_JOHN GILPIN_,Of running such a rig.
1672,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1673,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,"
1674,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Like streamer long and gay,"
1675,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Till, loop and button failing both,"
1676,_JOHN GILPIN_,At last it flew away.
1677,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1678,_JOHN GILPIN_,Then might all people well discern
1679,_JOHN GILPIN_,The bottles he had slung;
1680,_JOHN GILPIN_,A bottle swinging at each side
1681,_JOHN GILPIN_,As hath been said or sung.
1682,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1683,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,"
1684,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Up flew the windows all,"
1685,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And every soul cried out, Well done!"
1686,_JOHN GILPIN_,As loud as he could bawl.
1687,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1688,_JOHN GILPIN_,Away went Gilpin--who but he?
1689,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His fame soon spread around,"
1690,_JOHN GILPIN_,"He carries weight, he rides a race,"
1691,_JOHN GILPIN_,'Tis for a thousand pound.
1692,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1693,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And still as fast as he drew near,"
1694,_JOHN GILPIN_,'Twas wonderful to view
1695,_JOHN GILPIN_,How in a trice the turnpike-men
1696,_JOHN GILPIN_,Their gates wide open threw.
1697,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1698,_JOHN GILPIN_,And now as he went bowing down
1699,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His reeking head full low,"
1700,_JOHN GILPIN_,The bottles twain behind his back
1701,_JOHN GILPIN_,Were shatter'd at a blow.
1702,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1703,_JOHN GILPIN_,Down ran the wine into the road
1704,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Most piteous to be seen,"
1705,_JOHN GILPIN_,Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
1706,_JOHN GILPIN_,As they had basted been.
1707,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1708,_JOHN GILPIN_,"But still he seem'd to carry weight,"
1709,_JOHN GILPIN_,"With leathern girdle braced,"
1710,_JOHN GILPIN_,For all might see the bottle-necks
1711,_JOHN GILPIN_,Still dangling at his waist.
1712,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1713,_JOHN GILPIN_,Thus all through merry Islington
1714,_JOHN GILPIN_,"These gambols he did play,"
1715,_JOHN GILPIN_,And till he came unto the Wash
1716,_JOHN GILPIN_,Of Edmonton so gay.
1717,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1718,_JOHN GILPIN_,And there he threw the Wash about
1719,_JOHN GILPIN_,"On both sides of the way,"
1720,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Just like unto a trundling mop,"
1721,_JOHN GILPIN_,Or a wild-goose at play.
1722,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1723,_JOHN GILPIN_,At Edmonton his loving wife
1724,_JOHN GILPIN_,From the balcòny spied
1725,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Her tender husband, wondering much"
1726,_JOHN GILPIN_,To see how he did ride.
1727,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1728,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house--"
1729,_JOHN GILPIN_,"They all at once did cry,"
1730,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
1731,_JOHN GILPIN_,Said Gilpin--So am I!
1732,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1733,_JOHN GILPIN_,But yet his horse was not a whit
1734,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Inclined to tarry there,"
1735,_JOHN GILPIN_,For why? his owner had a house
1736,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Full ten miles off, at Ware."
1737,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1738,_JOHN GILPIN_,So like an arrow swift he flew
1739,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Shot by an archer strong,"
1740,_JOHN GILPIN_,So did he fly--which brings me to
1741,_JOHN GILPIN_,The middle of my song.
1742,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1743,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Away went Gilpin, out of breath,"
1744,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And sore against his will,"
1745,_JOHN GILPIN_,Till at his friend the Callender's
1746,_JOHN GILPIN_,His horse at last stood still.
1747,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1748,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The Callender, amazed to see"
1749,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His neighbour in such trim,"
1750,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,"
1751,_JOHN GILPIN_,And thus accosted him--
1752,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1753,_JOHN GILPIN_,"What news? what news? your tidings tell,"
1754,_JOHN GILPIN_,Tell me you must and shall--
1755,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Say, why bareheaded you are come,"
1756,_JOHN GILPIN_,Or why you come at all?
1757,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1758,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,"
1759,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And loved a timely joke,"
1760,_JOHN GILPIN_,And thus unto the Callender
1761,_JOHN GILPIN_,In merry guise he spoke--
1762,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1763,_JOHN GILPIN_,I came because your horse would come;
1764,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And if I well forbode,"
1765,_JOHN GILPIN_,"My hat and wig will soon be here,"
1766,_JOHN GILPIN_,They are upon the road.
1767,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1768,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The Callender, right glad to find"
1769,_JOHN GILPIN_,"His friend in merry pin,"
1770,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Return'd him not a single word,"
1771,_JOHN GILPIN_,But to the house went in.
1772,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1773,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Whence straight he came with hat and wig,"
1774,_JOHN GILPIN_,"A wig that flow'd behind,"
1775,_JOHN GILPIN_,"A hat not much the worse for wear,"
1776,_JOHN GILPIN_,Each comely in its kind.
1777,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1778,_JOHN GILPIN_,"He held them up, and in his turn"
1779,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Thus show'd his ready wit,"
1780,_JOHN GILPIN_,"My head is twice as big as yours,"
1781,_JOHN GILPIN_,They therefore needs must fit.
1782,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1783,_JOHN GILPIN_,"But let me scrape the dirt away,"
1784,_JOHN GILPIN_,That hangs upon your face;
1785,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And stop and eat, for well you may"
1786,_JOHN GILPIN_,Be in a hungry case.
1787,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1788,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Said John--It is my wedding-day,"
1789,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And all the world would stare,"
1790,_JOHN GILPIN_,If wife should dine at Edmonton
1791,_JOHN GILPIN_,And I should dine at Ware.
1792,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1793,_JOHN GILPIN_,"So, turning to his horse, he said,"
1794,_JOHN GILPIN_,"I am in haste to dine,"
1795,_JOHN GILPIN_,"'Twas for your pleasure you came here,"
1796,_JOHN GILPIN_,You shall go back for mine.
1797,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1798,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!"
1799,_JOHN GILPIN_,"For which he paid full dear,"
1800,_JOHN GILPIN_,For while he spake a braying ass
1801,_JOHN GILPIN_,Did sing most loud and clear.
1802,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1803,_JOHN GILPIN_,Whereat his horse did snort as he
1804,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Had heard a lion roar,"
1805,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And gallop'd off with all his might,"
1806,_JOHN GILPIN_,As he had done before.
1807,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1808,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
1809,_JOHN GILPIN_,Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
1810,_JOHN GILPIN_,"He lost them sooner than at first,"
1811,_JOHN GILPIN_,For why? they were too big.
1812,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1813,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw"
1814,_JOHN GILPIN_,Her husband posting down
1815,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Into the country far away,"
1816,_JOHN GILPIN_,She pull'd out half-a-crown;
1817,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1818,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And thus unto the youth she said,"
1819,_JOHN GILPIN_,"That drove them to the Bell,"
1820,_JOHN GILPIN_,"This shall be yours, when you bring back"
1821,_JOHN GILPIN_,My husband safe and well.
1822,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1823,_JOHN GILPIN_,"The youth did ride, and soon did meet"
1824,_JOHN GILPIN_,"John coming back amain,"
1825,_JOHN GILPIN_,Whom in a trice he tried to stop
1826,_JOHN GILPIN_,By catching at his rein.
1827,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1828,_JOHN GILPIN_,"But not performing what he meant,"
1829,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And gladly would have done,"
1830,_JOHN GILPIN_,The frighten'd steed he frighten'd more
1831,_JOHN GILPIN_,And made him faster run.
1832,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1833,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
1834,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Went postboy at his heels,"
1835,_JOHN GILPIN_,The postboy's horse right glad to miss
1836,_JOHN GILPIN_,The lumbering of the wheels.
1837,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1838,_JOHN GILPIN_,Six gentlemen upon the road
1839,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Thus seeing Gilpin fly,"
1840,_JOHN GILPIN_,"With postboy scampering in the rear,"
1841,_JOHN GILPIN_,They raised the hue and cry.
1842,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1843,_JOHN GILPIN_,Stop thief!--stop thief!--a highwayman!
1844,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Not one of them was mute,"
1845,_JOHN GILPIN_,And all and each that pass'd that way
1846,_JOHN GILPIN_,Did join in the pursuit.
1847,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1848,_JOHN GILPIN_,And now the turnpike gates again
1849,_JOHN GILPIN_,"Flew open in short space,"
1850,_JOHN GILPIN_,The toll-men thinking as before
1851,_JOHN GILPIN_,That Gilpin rode a race.
1852,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1853,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And so he did and won it too,"
1854,_JOHN GILPIN_,"For he got first to town,"
1855,_JOHN GILPIN_,Nor stopp'd till where he had got up
1856,_JOHN GILPIN_,He did again get down.
1857,_JOHN GILPIN_,
1858,_JOHN GILPIN_,"--Now let us sing, Long live the king,"
1859,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And Gilpin long live he,"
1860,_JOHN GILPIN_,"And when he next doth ride abroad,"
1861,_JOHN GILPIN_,May I be there to see!

2120,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"In a bold determined hand,"
2121,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,And the Prince of all the land

2123,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,
2124,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,"Like leviathans afloat,"

2126,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,While the sign of battle flew
2127,_BATTLE OF THE BALTIC_,On the lofty British line:

2207,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
2208,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,
2209,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,He stay'd not for brake and he stopp'd not for stone;

2236,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,
2237,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,"So stately his form, and so lovely her face,"

2243,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,
2244,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,"One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,"
2245,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,When they reach'd the hall door; and the charger stood near;
2246,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,"So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,"
2247,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
2248,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,"'She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;"
2249,_YOUNG LOCHINVAR_,"They'll have fleet steeds that follow,' quoth young Lochinvar."

5289,A VISION IN A DREAM,
5290,A VISION IN A DREAM,
5291,A VISION IN A DREAM,In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
5292,A VISION IN A DREAM,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
5293,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
5294,A VISION IN A DREAM,Through caverns measureless to man
5295,A VISION IN A DREAM,Down to a sunless sea.
5296,A VISION IN A DREAM,So twice five miles of fertile ground
5297,A VISION IN A DREAM,With walls and towers were girdled round:
5298,A VISION IN A DREAM,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
5299,A VISION IN A DREAM,Where blossom'd many an incense-bearing tree;
5300,A VISION IN A DREAM,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
5301,A VISION IN A DREAM,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
5302,A VISION IN A DREAM,
5303,A VISION IN A DREAM,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
5304,A VISION IN A DREAM,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
5305,A VISION IN A DREAM,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
5306,A VISION IN A DREAM,As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
5307,A VISION IN A DREAM,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
5308,A VISION IN A DREAM,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething"
5309,A VISION IN A DREAM,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
5310,A VISION IN A DREAM,A mighty fountain momently was forced:
5311,A VISION IN A DREAM,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
5312,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
5313,A VISION IN A DREAM,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail;
5314,A VISION IN A DREAM,And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
5315,A VISION IN A DREAM,It flung up momently the sacred river.
5316,A VISION IN A DREAM,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
5317,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
5318,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Then reach'd the caverns measureless to man,"
5319,A VISION IN A DREAM,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
5320,A VISION IN A DREAM,And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
5321,A VISION IN A DREAM,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
5322,A VISION IN A DREAM,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
5323,A VISION IN A DREAM,Floated midway on the waves;
5324,A VISION IN A DREAM,Where was heard the mingled measure
5325,A VISION IN A DREAM,From the fountain and the caves.
5326,A VISION IN A DREAM,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
5327,A VISION IN A DREAM,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

5334,A VISION IN A DREAM,"And on her dulcimer she played,"
5335,A VISION IN A DREAM,Singing of Mount Abora.
5336,A VISION IN A DREAM,Could I revive within me
5337,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Her symphony and song,"
5338,A VISION IN A DREAM,To such a deep delight 'twould win me
5339,A VISION IN A DREAM,"That with music loud and long,"
5340,A VISION IN A DREAM,"I would build that dome in air,"
5341,A VISION IN A DREAM,That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!
5342,A VISION IN A DREAM,And all who heard should see them there
5343,A VISION IN A DREAM,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
5344,A VISION IN A DREAM,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
5345,A VISION IN A DREAM,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
5346,A VISION IN A DREAM,And close your eyes with holy dread
5347,A VISION IN A DREAM,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
5348,A VISION IN A DREAM,And drunk the milk of Paradise.

5782,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"Sent from beyond the skies,"

5804,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The breath of peace we drew
5805,_THE RECOLLECTION_,With its soft motion made not less
5806,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The calm that round us grew.
5807,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"There seemed, from the remotest seat"
5808,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Of the white mountain waste
5809,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"To the soft flower beneath our feet,"

5819,_THE RECOLLECTION_,
5820,_THE RECOLLECTION_,We paused beside the pools that lie
5821,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Under the forest bough.
5822,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Each seem'd as 'twere a little sky

5828,_THE RECOLLECTION_,In which the lovely forests grew
5829,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"As in the upper air,"
5830,_THE RECOLLECTION_,More perfect both in shape and hue
5831,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Than any spreading there.
5832,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"There lay the glade, the neighbouring lawn,"
5833,_THE RECOLLECTION_,And through the dark-green wood
5834,_THE RECOLLECTION_,The white sun twinkling like the dawn
5835,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Out of a speckled cloud.
5836,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Sweet views which in our world above
5837,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Can never well be seen
5838,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Were imaged by the water's love
5839,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Of that fair forest green;
5840,_THE RECOLLECTION_,And all was interfused beneath
5841,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"With an Elysian glow,"
5842,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"An atmosphere without a breath,"
5843,_THE RECOLLECTION_,A softer day below.
5844,_THE RECOLLECTION_,

5847,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Its every leaf and lineament
5848,_THE RECOLLECTION_,With more than truth exprest;
5849,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"Until an envious wind crept by,--"
5850,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Like an unwelcome thought
5851,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Which from the mind's too faithful eye
5852,_THE RECOLLECTION_,Blots one dear image out.
5853,_THE RECOLLECTION_,"Though Thou art ever fair and kind,"

8325,PART VI,And by the holy rood!
8326,PART VI,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
8327,PART VI,On every corse there stood.
8328,PART VI,
8329,PART VI,"'This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
8330,PART VI,It was a heavenly sight!
8331,PART VI,"They stood as signals to the land,"

8336,PART VI,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
8337,PART VI,Like music on my heart.
8338,PART VI,
8339,PART VI,"'But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
8340,PART VI,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
8341,PART VI,"My head was turn'd perforce away,"
8342,PART VI,And I saw a boat appear.
8343,PART VI,
8344,PART VI,"'The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,"

8346,PART VI,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
8347,PART VI,The dead men could not blast.
8348,PART VI,
8349,PART VI,'I saw a third--I heard his voice:
8350,PART VI,It is the Hermit good!
8351,PART VI,He singeth loud his godly hymns
8352,PART VI,That he makes in the wood.
8353,PART VI,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
8354,PART VI,The Albatross's blood.'

8359,PART VII,'This Hermit good lives in that wood
8360,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
8361,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
8362,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
8363,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
8364,PART VII,
8365,PART VII,"'He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
8366,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:
8367,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
8368,PART VII,The rotted old oak stump.
8369,PART VII,
8370,PART VII,"'The skiff-boat near'd: I heard them talk,"
8371,PART VII,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"

8374,PART VII,
8375,PART VII,"'""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
8376,PART VII,"""And they answer'd not our cheer!"
8377,PART VII,"The planks look warp'd! and see those sails,"
8378,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
8379,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"

8381,PART VII,
8382,PART VII,"'""Brown skeletons of leaves that lag"
8383,PART VII,My forest-brook along;

8391,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
8392,PART VII,
8393,PART VII,"'The boat came closer to the ship,"
8394,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirred;
8395,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
8396,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
8397,PART VII,
8398,PART VII,"'Under the water it rumbled on,"
8399,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
8400,PART VII,"It reach'd the ship, it split the bay:"
8401,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
8402,PART VII,
8403,PART VII,"'Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,"
8404,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
8405,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
8406,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
8407,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
8408,PART VII,Within the Pilot's boat.
8409,PART VII,
8410,PART VII,"'Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
8411,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
8412,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
8413,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
8414,PART VII,
8415,PART VII,'I moved my lips--the Pilot shriek'd
8416,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
8417,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
8418,PART VII,And prayed where he did sit.
8419,PART VII,
8420,PART VII,"'I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
8421,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
8422,PART VII,"Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while"
8423,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
8424,PART VII,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see"
8425,PART VII,The Devil knows how to row.'

8427,PART VII,[Illustration]
8428,PART VII,
8429,PART VII,"'And now, all in my own countree,"
8430,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
8431,PART VII,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
8432,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
8433,PART VII,
8434,PART VII,"'""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"""
8435,PART VII,The Hermit crossed his brow.
8436,PART VII,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say--"
8437,PART VII,"What manner of man art thou?"""
8438,PART VII,
8439,PART VII,'Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
8440,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
8441,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;
8442,PART VII,And then it left me free.
8443,PART VII,
8444,PART VII,"'Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
8445,PART VII,That agony returns;
8446,PART VII,"And till my ghastly tale is told,"
8447,PART VII,This heart within me burns.
8448,PART VII,
8449,PART VII,"'I pass, like night, from land to land;"
8450,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
8451,PART VII,"The moment that his face I see,"
8452,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me:
8453,PART VII,To him my tale I teach.
8454,PART VII,
8455,PART VII,'What loud uproar bursts from that door!
8456,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
8457,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
8458,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
8459,PART VII,"And hark the little vesper bell,"
8460,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!

8466,PART VII,
8467,PART VII,"'O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
8468,PART VII,"'Tis sweeter far to me,"

8932,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"The nevir a word had Dickie to say,"
8933,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Sae he thrust the lance through his fause bodie.
8934,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8935,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Then on we held for Carlisle toun,"
8936,_KINMONT WILLIE_,And at Staneshaw-bank the Eden we cross'd;
8937,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"The water was great and meikle of spait,"
8938,_KINMONT WILLIE_,But the niver a horse nor man we lost.
8939,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8940,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And when we reach'd the Staneshaw-bank,"
8941,_KINMONT WILLIE_,The wind was rising loud and hie;
8942,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And there the laird garr'd leave our steeds,"
8943,_KINMONT WILLIE_,For fear that they should stamp and nie.
8944,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8945,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And when we left the Staneshaw-bank,"
8946,_KINMONT WILLIE_,The wind began full loud to blaw;
8947,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"But 'twas wind and weet, and fire and sleet,"
8948,_KINMONT WILLIE_,When we came beneath the castle wa'.
8949,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8950,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"We crept on knees, and held our breath,"
8951,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Till we placed the ladders against the wa';
8952,_KINMONT WILLIE_,And sae ready was Buccleuch himsell
8953,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"To mount the first, before us a'."

8956,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8957,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"He has ta'en the watchman by the throat,"

8960,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Upon the other side thou hadst gaed!
8961,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8962,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'Now sound out, trumpets!' quo' Buccleuch;"
8963,_KINMONT WILLIE_,'Let's waken Lord Scroope right merrilie!'
8964,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Then loud the warden's trumpet blew--
8965,_KINMONT WILLIE_,'_O wha dare meddle wi' me?_'
8966,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8967,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Then speedilie to work we gaed,"
8968,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And raised the slogan ane and a',"
8969,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And cut a hole thro' a sheet of lead,"
8970,_KINMONT WILLIE_,And so we wan to the castle ha'.
8971,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8972,_KINMONT WILLIE_,They thought King James and a' his men

8976,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8977,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Wi' coulters, and wi' fore-hammers,"
8978,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"We garr'd the bars bang merrilie,"
8979,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Until we cam to the inner prison,"
8980,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie.
8981,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8982,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"And when we cam to the lower prison,"
8983,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Where Willie o' Kinmont he did lie--
8984,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'O sleep ye, wake ye, Kinmont Willie,"
8985,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Upon the morn that thou's to die?'
8986,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8987,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'O I sleep saft, and I wake aft;"
8988,_KINMONT WILLIE_,It's lang since sleeping was fley'd frae me;

8990,_KINMONT WILLIE_,And a' gude fellows that spier for me.'
8991,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8992,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Then Red Rowan has hente him up,"

8994,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'Abide, abide now, Red Rowan,"
8995,_KINMONT WILLIE_,Till of my Lord Scroope I take farewell.
8996,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
8997,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'Farewell, farewell, my gude Lord Scroope!"
8998,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"My gude Lord Scroope, farewell!' he cried--"
8999,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'I'll pay you for my lodging maill,"
9000,_KINMONT WILLIE_,When first we meet on the Border side.'
9001,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
9002,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"Then shoulder high, with shout and cry,"
9003,_KINMONT WILLIE_,We bore him down the ladder lang;
9004,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"At every stride Red Rowan made,"
9005,_KINMONT WILLIE_,I wot the Kinmont's airns played clang!
9006,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
9007,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'O mony a time,' quo' Kinmont Willie,"
9008,_KINMONT WILLIE_,'I have ridden horse baith wild and wood;

9012,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'And mony a time,' quo' Kinmont Willie,"
9013,_KINMONT WILLIE_,'I've pricked a horse out oure the furs;

9017,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"We scarce had won the Staneshaw-bank,"

9026,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
9027,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"He turned him on the other side,"
9028,_KINMONT WILLIE_,And at Lord Scroope his glove flung he--
9029,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"'If ye like na my visit in merry England,"
9030,_KINMONT WILLIE_,In fair Scotland come visit me!'
9031,_KINMONT WILLIE_,
9032,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"All sore astonished stood Lord Scroope,"
9033,_KINMONT WILLIE_,He stood as still as rock of stane;
9034,_KINMONT WILLIE_,"He scarcely dared to trew his eyes,"
9035,_KINMONT WILLIE_,When thro' the water they had gane.

10825,THE HYMN,"Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling,"
10826,THE HYMN,Now was almost won
10827,THE HYMN,"To think her part was done,"
10828,THE HYMN,And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
10829,THE HYMN,She knew such harmony alone
10830,THE HYMN,Could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union.
10831,THE HYMN,
10832,THE HYMN,At last surrounds their sight
10833,THE HYMN,"A globe of circular light,"
10834,THE HYMN,That with long beams the shamefac'd night array'd;
10835,THE HYMN,"The helmèd Cherubim,"
10836,THE HYMN,"And sworded Seraphim,"
10837,THE HYMN,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,"
10838,THE HYMN,"Harping in loud and solemn quire,"
10839,THE HYMN,With unexpressive notes to Heaven's new-born Heir.
10840,THE HYMN,
10841,THE HYMN,Such music (as 'tis said)
10842,THE HYMN,"Before was never made,"
10843,THE HYMN,"But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,"
10844,THE HYMN,While the Creator great
10845,THE HYMN,"His constellations set,"
10846,THE HYMN,"And the well-balanc'd world on hinges hung,"
10847,THE HYMN,"Ana cast the dark foundations deep,"
10848,THE HYMN,"And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep,"
10849,THE HYMN,
10850,THE HYMN,"Ring out, ye crystal spheres,"
10851,THE HYMN,"Once bless our human ears,"
10852,THE HYMN,If ye have power to touch our senses so;
10853,THE HYMN,And let your silver chime
10854,THE HYMN,"Move in melodious time,"
10855,THE HYMN,And let the bass of Heav'n's deep organ blow;
10856,THE HYMN,And with your nine-fold harmony
10857,THE HYMN,Make up full consort to th' angelic symphony.
10858,THE HYMN,
10859,THE HYMN,For if such holy song
10860,THE HYMN,"Inwrap our fancy long,"
10861,THE HYMN,"Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,"
10862,THE HYMN,And speckled Vanity
10863,THE HYMN,"Will sicken soon and die,"
10864,THE HYMN,And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould
10865,THE HYMN,"And Hell itself will pass away,"
10866,THE HYMN,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
10867,THE HYMN,
10868,THE HYMN,"Yea, Truth and Justice then"
10869,THE HYMN,"Will down return to men,"
10870,THE HYMN,"Orb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,"
10871,THE HYMN,"Mercy will set between,"
10872,THE HYMN,"Throned in celestial sheen,"
10873,THE HYMN,With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering:
10874,THE HYMN,"And Heav'n, as at some festival,"
10875,THE HYMN,Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
10876,THE HYMN,
10877,THE HYMN,"But wisest Fate says, No,"
10878,THE HYMN,"This must not yet be so,"
10879,THE HYMN,"The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy,"
10880,THE HYMN,That on the bitter cross
10881,THE HYMN,Must redeem our loss;
10882,THE HYMN,So both himself and us to glorify;
10883,THE HYMN,"Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,"
10884,THE HYMN,"The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,"
10885,THE HYMN,
10886,THE HYMN,With such a horrid clang
10887,THE HYMN,"As on mount Sinai rang,"
10888,THE HYMN,While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:
10889,THE HYMN,"The aged Earth aghast,"
10890,THE HYMN,"With terror of that blast,"
10891,THE HYMN,Shall from the surface to the centre shake;
10892,THE HYMN,"When at the world's last session,"
10893,THE HYMN,The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.
10894,THE HYMN,
10895,THE HYMN,And then at last our bliss
10896,THE HYMN,"Full and perfect is,"
10897,THE HYMN,But now begins; for from this happy day
10898,THE HYMN,The old Dragon under ground
10899,THE HYMN,"In straiter limits bound,"
10900,THE HYMN,"Not half so far casts his usurpèd sway,"
10901,THE HYMN,"And wroth to see his kingdom fail,"
10902,THE HYMN,Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.
10903,THE HYMN,
10904,THE HYMN,[Illustration]
10905,THE HYMN,
10906,THE HYMN,"The oracles are dumb,"
10907,THE HYMN,No voice or hideous hum
10908,THE HYMN,Runs thro' the archèd roof in words deceiving.
10909,THE HYMN,Apollo from his shrine
10910,THE HYMN,"Can no more divine,"
10911,THE HYMN,With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
10912,THE HYMN,No nightly trance or breathèd spell
10913,THE HYMN,Inspires the pale-ey'd priest from the prophetic cell.
10914,THE HYMN,
10915,THE HYMN,"The lonely mountains o'er,"
10916,THE HYMN,"And the resounding shore,"
10917,THE HYMN,"A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;"
10918,THE HYMN,From haunted spring and dale
10919,THE HYMN,"Edg'd with poplar pale,"
10920,THE HYMN,The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
10921,THE HYMN,With flow'r-inwoven tresses torn
10922,THE HYMN,The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
10923,THE HYMN,
10924,THE HYMN,"In consecrated earth,"
10925,THE HYMN,"And on the holy hearth,"
10926,THE HYMN,"The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;"
10927,THE HYMN,"In urns, and altars round,"
10928,THE HYMN,A drear and dying sound
10929,THE HYMN,Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
10930,THE HYMN,"And the chill marble seems to sweat,"
10931,THE HYMN,While each peculiar Power forgoes his wonted seat.
10932,THE HYMN,
10933,THE HYMN,Peor and Baälim
10934,THE HYMN,"Forsake their temples dim,"
10935,THE HYMN,With that twice-batter'd god of Palestine;
10936,THE HYMN,"And moonèd Ashtaroth,"
10937,THE HYMN,"Heaven's queen and mother both,"
10938,THE HYMN,Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;
10939,THE HYMN,The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn.
10940,THE HYMN,In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.
10941,THE HYMN,
10942,THE HYMN,"And sullen Moloch fled,"
10943,THE HYMN,Hath left in shadows dread
10944,THE HYMN,His burning idol all of blackest hue;
10945,THE HYMN,In vain with cymbals' ring
10946,THE HYMN,"They call the grisly king,"
10947,THE HYMN,In dismal dance about the furnace blue:
10948,THE HYMN,"The brutish gods of Nile as fast,"
10949,THE HYMN,"Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis haste."
10950,THE HYMN,
10951,THE HYMN,[Illustration]
10952,THE HYMN,
10953,THE HYMN,Nor is Osiris seen
10954,THE HYMN,"In Memphian grove or green,"
10955,THE HYMN,Trampling the unshow'r'd grass with lowings loud:
10956,THE HYMN,Nor can he be at rest
10957,THE HYMN,"Within his sacred chest,"
10958,THE HYMN,Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud;
10959,THE HYMN,In vain with timbrell'd anthems dark
10960,THE HYMN,The sable-stolèd sorcerers bear his worship'd ark.
10961,THE HYMN,
10962,THE HYMN,He feels from Juda's land
10963,THE HYMN,"The dreaded infant's hand,"
10964,THE HYMN,The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
10965,THE HYMN,"Not all the gods beside,"
10966,THE HYMN,"Longer dare abide,"
10967,THE HYMN,Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
10968,THE HYMN,"Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,"
10969,THE HYMN,Can in his swaddling bands control the damnèd crew.
10970,THE HYMN,
10971,THE HYMN,"So, when the sun in bed,"
10972,THE HYMN,"Curtain'd with cloudy red,"
10973,THE HYMN,"Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,"
10974,THE HYMN,The flocking shadows pale
10975,THE HYMN,"Troop to th' infernal jail,"
10976,THE HYMN,Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave;
10977,THE HYMN,And the yellow-skirted Fayes
10978,THE HYMN,"Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze."
10979,THE HYMN,
10980,THE HYMN,But see the Virgin blest
10981,THE HYMN,Hath laid her Babe to rest;
10982,THE HYMN,"Time is, our tedious song should here have ending;"
10983,THE HYMN,Heav'n's youngest teemèd star
10984,THE HYMN,"Hath fix'd her polish'd car,"
10985,THE HYMN,Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;
10986,THE HYMN,And all about the courtly stable
10987,THE HYMN,Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.

11033,_CHRISTABEL_,And the owls have awakened the crowing cock!
11034,_CHRISTABEL_,Tu--whit!--Tu--whoo!
11035,_CHRISTABEL_,"And hark, again! the crowing cock,"
11036,_CHRISTABEL_,How drowsily it crew.
11037,_CHRISTABEL_,
11038,_CHRISTABEL_,"Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,"
11039,_CHRISTABEL_,Hath a toothless mastiff bitch
11040,_CHRISTABEL_,From her kennel beneath the rock
11041,_CHRISTABEL_,"Maketh answer to the clock,"
11042,_CHRISTABEL_,"Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour;"
11043,_CHRISTABEL_,"Ever and aye, by shine and shower,"
11044,_CHRISTABEL_,"Sixteen short howls, not over loud:"
11045,_CHRISTABEL_,"Some say, she sees my lady's shroud."
11046,_CHRISTABEL_,
11047,_CHRISTABEL_,Is the night chilly and dark?
11048,_CHRISTABEL_,"The night is chilly, but not dark."
11049,_CHRISTABEL_,"The thin gray cloud is spread on high,"
11050,_CHRISTABEL_,It covers but not hides the sky.
11051,_CHRISTABEL_,"The moon is behind, and at the full;"
11052,_CHRISTABEL_,And yet she looks both small and dull.
11053,_CHRISTABEL_,"The night is chill, the cloud is gray:"
11054,_CHRISTABEL_,"'Tis a month before the month of May,"
11055,_CHRISTABEL_,And the Spring comes slowly up this way.
11056,_CHRISTABEL_,
11057,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lovely lady, Christabel,"
11058,_CHRISTABEL_,"Whom her father loves so well,"
11059,_CHRISTABEL_,"What makes her in the wood so late,"
11060,_CHRISTABEL_,A furlong from the castle gate?
11061,_CHRISTABEL_,She had dreams all yesternight
11062,_CHRISTABEL_,Of her own betrothed knight;
11063,_CHRISTABEL_,And she in the midnight wood will pray
11064,_CHRISTABEL_,For the weal of her lover that's far away.
11065,_CHRISTABEL_,
11066,_CHRISTABEL_,"She stole along, she nothing spoke,"
11067,_CHRISTABEL_,"The sighs she heaved were soft and low,"
11068,_CHRISTABEL_,"And naught was green upon the oak,"
11069,_CHRISTABEL_,But moss and rarest misletoe;
11070,_CHRISTABEL_,"She kneels beneath the huge oak tree,"
11071,_CHRISTABEL_,And in silence prayeth she.
11072,_CHRISTABEL_,
11073,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lady sprang up suddenly,"
11074,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lovely lady, Christabel!"
11075,_CHRISTABEL_,"It moaned as near, as near can be,"
11076,_CHRISTABEL_,"But what it is, she cannot tell.--"
11077,_CHRISTABEL_,"On the other side it seems to be,"
11078,_CHRISTABEL_,"Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree."
11079,_CHRISTABEL_,
11080,_CHRISTABEL_,The night is chill; the forest bare;
11081,_CHRISTABEL_,Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?
11082,_CHRISTABEL_,There is not wind enough in the air
11083,_CHRISTABEL_,To move away the ringlet curl
11084,_CHRISTABEL_,From the lovely lady's cheek--
11085,_CHRISTABEL_,There is not wind enough to twirl
11086,_CHRISTABEL_,"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,"
11087,_CHRISTABEL_,"That dances as often as dance it can,"
11088,_CHRISTABEL_,"Hanging so light, and hanging so high,"
11089,_CHRISTABEL_,On the topmost twig that looks up to the sky.
11090,_CHRISTABEL_,
11091,_CHRISTABEL_,"Hush, beating heart of Christabel!"
11092,_CHRISTABEL_,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
11093,_CHRISTABEL_,"She folded her arms beneath her cloak,"
11094,_CHRISTABEL_,And stole to the other side of the oak.
11095,_CHRISTABEL_,What sees she there?
11096,_CHRISTABEL_,
11097,_CHRISTABEL_,"There she sees a damsel bright,"
11098,_CHRISTABEL_,"Drest in a silken robe of white,"
11099,_CHRISTABEL_,That shadowy in the moonlight shone:
11100,_CHRISTABEL_,"The neck that made that white robe wan,"
11101,_CHRISTABEL_,"Her stately neck, and arms were bare:"
11102,_CHRISTABEL_,Her blue-veined feet unsandaled were;
11103,_CHRISTABEL_,And wildly glittered here and there
11104,_CHRISTABEL_,The gems entangled in her hair.
11105,_CHRISTABEL_,"I guess, 'twas frightful there to see"
11106,_CHRISTABEL_,A lady so richly clad as she--
11107,_CHRISTABEL_,Beautiful exceedingly!
11108,_CHRISTABEL_,
11109,_CHRISTABEL_,"Mary mother, save me now!"
11110,_CHRISTABEL_,"(Said Christabel), And who art thou?"
11111,_CHRISTABEL_,
11112,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lady strange made answer meet,"
11113,_CHRISTABEL_,And her voice was faint and sweet:--
11114,_CHRISTABEL_,"Have pity on my sore distress,"
11115,_CHRISTABEL_,I scarce can speak for weariness.
11116,_CHRISTABEL_,"Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear,"
11117,_CHRISTABEL_,"Said Christabel, How camest thou here?"
11118,_CHRISTABEL_,"And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet"
11119,_CHRISTABEL_,Did thus pursue her answer meet:--
11120,_CHRISTABEL_,
11121,_CHRISTABEL_,"My sire is of a noble line,"
11122,_CHRISTABEL_,And my name is Geraldine:
11123,_CHRISTABEL_,"Five warriors seized me yestermorn,"
11124,_CHRISTABEL_,"Me, even me, a maid forlorn:"
11125,_CHRISTABEL_,"They choked my cries with force and fright,"
11126,_CHRISTABEL_,And tied me on a palfrey white.
11127,_CHRISTABEL_,"The palfrey was as fleet as wind,"
11128,_CHRISTABEL_,And they rode furiously behind.
11129,_CHRISTABEL_,"They spurred amain, their steeds were white;"
11130,_CHRISTABEL_,And once we crossed the shade of night.
11131,_CHRISTABEL_,
11132,_CHRISTABEL_,[Illustration]
11133,_CHRISTABEL_,
11134,_CHRISTABEL_,"As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,"
11135,_CHRISTABEL_,I have no thought what men they be;
11136,_CHRISTABEL_,Nor do I know how long it is
11137,_CHRISTABEL_,(For I have lain entranced I wis)
11138,_CHRISTABEL_,"Since one, the tallest of the five,"
11139,_CHRISTABEL_,"Took me from the palfrey's back,"
11140,_CHRISTABEL_,"A weary woman, scarce alive."
11141,_CHRISTABEL_,Some muttered words his comrades spoke:
11142,_CHRISTABEL_,"He placed me underneath this oak,"
11143,_CHRISTABEL_,He swore they would return with haste
11144,_CHRISTABEL_,Whither they went I cannot tell--
11145,_CHRISTABEL_,"I thought I heard, some minutes past,"
11146,_CHRISTABEL_,Sounds as of a castle bell.
11147,_CHRISTABEL_,"Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she),"
11148,_CHRISTABEL_,And help a wretched maid to flee.
11149,_CHRISTABEL_,
11150,_CHRISTABEL_,Then Christabel stretched forth her hand
11151,_CHRISTABEL_,And comforted fair Geraldine:
11152,_CHRISTABEL_,O well bright dame may you command
11153,_CHRISTABEL_,The service of Sir Leoline;
11154,_CHRISTABEL_,And gladly our stout chivalry
11155,_CHRISTABEL_,Will he send forth and friends withal
11156,_CHRISTABEL_,To guide and guard you safe and free
11157,_CHRISTABEL_,Home to your noble father's hall.
11158,_CHRISTABEL_,She rose: and forth with steps they passed
11159,_CHRISTABEL_,"That strove to be, and were not, fast."
11160,_CHRISTABEL_,"Her gracious stars the lady blest,"
11161,_CHRISTABEL_,And thus spake on sweet Christabel;
11162,_CHRISTABEL_,"All our household are at rest,"
11163,_CHRISTABEL_,"The hall as silent as the cell,"
11164,_CHRISTABEL_,Sir Leoline is weak in health
11165,_CHRISTABEL_,"And may not well awakened be,"
11166,_CHRISTABEL_,But we will move as if in stealth;
11167,_CHRISTABEL_,And I beseech your courtesy
11168,_CHRISTABEL_,"This night, to share your couch with me."
11169,_CHRISTABEL_,
11170,_CHRISTABEL_,"They crossed the moat, and Christabel"
11171,_CHRISTABEL_,Took the key that fitted well;
11172,_CHRISTABEL_,"A little door she opened straight,"
11173,_CHRISTABEL_,All in the middle of the gate;
11174,_CHRISTABEL_,"The gate that was ironed within and without,"
11175,_CHRISTABEL_,Where an army in battle-array had marched out.
11176,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lady sank, belike through pain,"
11177,_CHRISTABEL_,And Christabel with might and main
11178,_CHRISTABEL_,"Lifted her up, a weary weight,"
11179,_CHRISTABEL_,Over the threshold of the gate:
11180,_CHRISTABEL_,"Then the lady rose again,"
11181,_CHRISTABEL_,"And moved, as she were not in pain."
11182,_CHRISTABEL_,
11183,_CHRISTABEL_,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
11184,_CHRISTABEL_,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
11185,_CHRISTABEL_,And Christabel devoutly cried
11186,_CHRISTABEL_,"To the lady by her side,"
11187,_CHRISTABEL_,Praise we the Virgin all divine
11188,_CHRISTABEL_,Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!
11189,_CHRISTABEL_,"Alas, alas! said Geraldine,"
11190,_CHRISTABEL_,I cannot speak for weariness.
11191,_CHRISTABEL_,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
11192,_CHRISTABEL_,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
11193,_CHRISTABEL_,
11194,_CHRISTABEL_,"Outside her kennel, the mastiff old"
11195,_CHRISTABEL_,"Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold."
11196,_CHRISTABEL_,"The mastiff old did not awake,"
11197,_CHRISTABEL_,Yet she an angry moan did make!
11198,_CHRISTABEL_,And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
11199,_CHRISTABEL_,Never till now she uttered yell
11200,_CHRISTABEL_,Beneath the eye of Christabel.
11201,_CHRISTABEL_,Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
11202,_CHRISTABEL_,For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
11203,_CHRISTABEL_,
11204,_CHRISTABEL_,"They passed the hall, that echoes still,"
11205,_CHRISTABEL_,Pass as lightly as you will!
11206,_CHRISTABEL_,"The brands were flat, the brands were dying,"
11207,_CHRISTABEL_,Amid their own white ashes lying;
11208,_CHRISTABEL_,"But when the lady passed, there came"
11209,_CHRISTABEL_,"A tongue of light, a fit of flame;"
11210,_CHRISTABEL_,"And Christabel saw the lady's eye,"
11211,_CHRISTABEL_,"And nothing else saw she thereby,"
11212,_CHRISTABEL_,Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall
11213,_CHRISTABEL_,Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
11214,_CHRISTABEL_,"O softly tread, said Christabel,"
11215,_CHRISTABEL_,My father seldom sleepeth well.
11216,_CHRISTABEL_,
11217,_CHRISTABEL_,"Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,"
11218,_CHRISTABEL_,And jealous of the listening air
11219,_CHRISTABEL_,"They steal their way from stair to stair,"
11220,_CHRISTABEL_,"Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,"
11221,_CHRISTABEL_,And now they pass the Baron's room.
11222,_CHRISTABEL_,As still as death with stifled breath!
11223,_CHRISTABEL_,And now have reached her chamber door;
11224,_CHRISTABEL_,And now doth Geraldine press down
11225,_CHRISTABEL_,The rushes of the chamber floor.
11226,_CHRISTABEL_,
11227,_CHRISTABEL_,"The moon shines dim in the open air,"
11228,_CHRISTABEL_,And not a moonbeam enters here.
11229,_CHRISTABEL_,But they without its light can see
11230,_CHRISTABEL_,"The chamber carved so curiously,"
11231,_CHRISTABEL_,"Carved with figures strange and sweet,"
11232,_CHRISTABEL_,"All made out of the carver's brain,"
11233,_CHRISTABEL_,For a lady's chamber meet:
11234,_CHRISTABEL_,The lamp with twofold silver chain
11235,_CHRISTABEL_,Is fastened to an angel's feet.
11236,_CHRISTABEL_,
11237,_CHRISTABEL_,The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
11238,_CHRISTABEL_,But Christabel the lamp will trim.
11239,_CHRISTABEL_,"She trimm'd the lamp, and made it bright,"
11240,_CHRISTABEL_,"And left it swinging to and fro,"
11241,_CHRISTABEL_,"While Geraldine, in wretched plight,"
11242,_CHRISTABEL_,Sank down upon the floor below.
11243,_CHRISTABEL_,
11244,_CHRISTABEL_,"'O weary lady, Geraldine,"
11245,_CHRISTABEL_,"I pray you, drink this cordial wine!"
11246,_CHRISTABEL_,It is a wine of virtuous powers;
11247,_CHRISTABEL_,My mother made it of wild flowers.'
11248,_CHRISTABEL_,
11249,_CHRISTABEL_,"'And will your mother pity me,"
11250,_CHRISTABEL_,Who am a maiden most forlorn?'
11251,_CHRISTABEL_,Christabel answered--'Woe is me!
11252,_CHRISTABEL_,She died the hour that I was born.
11253,_CHRISTABEL_,"I have heard the grey-hair'd friar tell,"
11254,_CHRISTABEL_,"How on her death-bed she did say,"
11255,_CHRISTABEL_,That she should hear the castle-bell
11256,_CHRISTABEL_,Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
11257,_CHRISTABEL_,O mother dear! that thou wert here!'
11258,_CHRISTABEL_,"'I would,' said Geraldine, 'she were!'"
11259,_CHRISTABEL_,
11260,_CHRISTABEL_,"But soon with altered voice, said she--"
11261,_CHRISTABEL_,"'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!"
11262,_CHRISTABEL_,I have power to bid thee flee.'
11263,_CHRISTABEL_,Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
11264,_CHRISTABEL_,Why stares she with unsettled eye?
11265,_CHRISTABEL_,Can she the bodiless dead espy?
11266,_CHRISTABEL_,"And why with hollow voice cries she,"
11267,_CHRISTABEL_,"'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine--"
11268,_CHRISTABEL_,"Though thou her guardian spirit be,"
11269,_CHRISTABEL_,"Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me.'"
11270,_CHRISTABEL_,
11271,_CHRISTABEL_,"Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,"
11272,_CHRISTABEL_,And raised to heaven her eyes so blue--
11273,_CHRISTABEL_,"'Alas!' said she, 'this ghastly ride--"
11274,_CHRISTABEL_,Dear lady! it hath 'wilder'd you!
11275,_CHRISTABEL_,"The lady wiped her moist cold brow,"
11276,_CHRISTABEL_,"And faintly said, ''Tis over now!'"
11277,_CHRISTABEL_,
11278,_CHRISTABEL_,Again the wild-flower wine she drank:
11279,_CHRISTABEL_,"Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,"
11280,_CHRISTABEL_,"And from the floor whereon she sank,"
11281,_CHRISTABEL_,The lofty lady stood upright:
11282,_CHRISTABEL_,"She was most beautiful to see,"
11283,_CHRISTABEL_,Like a lady of a far countrèe.
11284,_CHRISTABEL_,
11285,_CHRISTABEL_,And thus the lofty lady spake--
11286,_CHRISTABEL_,"'All they who live in the upper sky,"
11287,_CHRISTABEL_,"Do love you, holy Christabel!"
11288,_CHRISTABEL_,"And you love them, and for their sake"
11289,_CHRISTABEL_,"And for the good which me befell,"
11290,_CHRISTABEL_,"Even I in my degree will try,"
11291,_CHRISTABEL_,"Fair maiden, to requite you well."
11292,_CHRISTABEL_,But now unrobe yourself; for I
11293,_CHRISTABEL_,"Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.'"
11294,_CHRISTABEL_,"Quoth Christabel, 'So let it be!'"
11295,_CHRISTABEL_,"And as the lady bade, did she."
11296,_CHRISTABEL_,"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
11297,_CHRISTABEL_,And lay down in her loveliness.
11298,_CHRISTABEL_,
11299,_CHRISTABEL_,But through her brain of weal and woe
11300,_CHRISTABEL_,"So many thoughts moved to and fro,"
11301,_CHRISTABEL_,That vain it were her lids to close;
11302,_CHRISTABEL_,"So half-way from the bed she rose,"
11303,_CHRISTABEL_,And on her elbow did recline
11304,_CHRISTABEL_,To look at the lady Geraldine.
11305,_CHRISTABEL_,
11306,_CHRISTABEL_,"Beneath the lamp the lady bow'd,"
11307,_CHRISTABEL_,And slowly roll'd her eyes around;
11308,_CHRISTABEL_,Then drawing in her breath aloud
11309,_CHRISTABEL_,"Like one that shudder'd, she unbound"
11310,_CHRISTABEL_,The cincture from beneath her breast:
11311,_CHRISTABEL_,"Her silken robe, and inner vest,"
11312,_CHRISTABEL_,"Dropt to her feet, and full in view,"
11313,_CHRISTABEL_,Behold! her bosom and half her side----
11314,_CHRISTABEL_,"A sight to dream of, not to tell!"
11315,_CHRISTABEL_,O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
11316,_CHRISTABEL_,
11317,_CHRISTABEL_,Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;
11318,_CHRISTABEL_,Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
11319,_CHRISTABEL_,Deep from within she seems half-way
11320,_CHRISTABEL_,"To lift some weight with sick assay,"
11321,_CHRISTABEL_,And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
11322,_CHRISTABEL_,"Then suddenly, as one defied,"
11323,_CHRISTABEL_,"Collects herself in scorn and pride,"
11324,_CHRISTABEL_,And lay down by the maiden's side!--
11325,_CHRISTABEL_,"And in her arms the maid she took,"
11326,_CHRISTABEL_,Ah well-a-day!
11327,_CHRISTABEL_,And with low voice and doleful look
11328,_CHRISTABEL_,These words did say:
11329,_CHRISTABEL_,"'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,"
11330,_CHRISTABEL_,"Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!"
11331,_CHRISTABEL_,"Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,"
11332,_CHRISTABEL_,"This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;"
11333,_CHRISTABEL_,"But vainly thou warrest,"
11334,_CHRISTABEL_,For this is alone in
11335,_CHRISTABEL_,"Thy power to declare,"
11336,_CHRISTABEL_,That in the dim forest
11337,_CHRISTABEL_,"Thou heard'st a low moaning,"
11338,_CHRISTABEL_,"And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;"
11339,_CHRISTABEL_,"And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,"
11340,_CHRISTABEL_,To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.'

11372,_YARROW UNVISITED_,
11373,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"'There's Gala Water, Leader Haughs,"

11386,_YARROW UNVISITED_,--Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;
11387,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"My true-love sigh'd for sorrow,"
11388,_YARROW UNVISITED_,"And looked me in the face, to think"

11458,_YARROW VISITED_,A tender hazy brightness;
11459,_YARROW VISITED_,Mild dawn of promise! that excludes

11469,_YARROW VISITED_,Now peaceful as the morning.

11486,_YARROW VISITED_,"Meek loveliness is round thee spread,"
11487,_YARROW VISITED_,A softness still and holy;
11488,_YARROW VISITED_,"The grace of forest charms decayed,"

11491,_YARROW VISITED_,"That region left, the vale unfolds"
