137,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"When snowdrifts blocked the country roads,"
138,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And trees were bending with their loads,"
139,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The wind grew mild which had been raw,"
140,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And winter yielded to a thaw;
141,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,That night the Brownies stood to stare
142,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,In wonder on the village square.
143,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Said one, ""This plot where drifts now roll"
144,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Seems like an acre from the Pole.
145,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,I have a scheme which nothing lacks:
146,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Now while the snow so closely packs,"
147,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And may be molded in the hand,"
148,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,We'll build a statue tall and grand
149,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Which here shall stand at morning prime,"
150,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"To be the wonder of the time."""
151,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Another cried, ""That suits us all."
152,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,To work let every member fall.
153,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,When once the task we undertake
154,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Be sure no dwarfish man we'll make;
155,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,But one that proudly may look down
156,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,On half the buildings in the town.
157,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,I know the place where builders keep
158,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Their benches while the snow is deep;
159,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The poles, and ladders too, are there,"
160,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,To use when working high in air.
161,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"While some for these with me will fly,"
162,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Let some their hands to snow apply,"
163,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And not a feature of the man
164,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Shall be neglected in our plan.

171,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,
172,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"""You know the night, some time ago,"
173,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,We tramped so far through drifted snow
174,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,To ornament with quaint design
175,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,The windows of a mansion fine;
176,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And how, on lengthy ladders there"
177,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And scaffold swinging in the air,"
178,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,We worked our brushes with a will
179,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"From icy cap to window-sill,"
180,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And made the people, great and small,"
181,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Believe Jack Frost had done it all?--
182,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"To-night we'll work as well, and show"
183,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"A grand result before we go."""

192,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,
193,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The snow that night was at its best,"
194,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And held its shape however pressed;
195,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Like dough beneath the baker's hand
196,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,It seemed to answer each demand.
197,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The rolls, when tumbled to and fro,"
198,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Increased with every turning, so"
199,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"First like a cushion on they sped,"
200,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Then like a pillow, next, a bed,"
201,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Until the snow, adhering there,"
202,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Would leave the grass or pebbles bare.
203,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,As higher blocks of snow were laid
204,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Still higher scaffolding was made,"
205,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And ladders brought to use instead
206,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Of those too short to reach the head.

219,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,
220,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Thus grew the form from hour to hour;
221,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"For Brownies' hands have wondrous power,"
222,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And let them turn to what they will
223,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Surprising work will follow still.
224,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Some shaped the legs or smoothed the waist,"
225,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Some saw plump arms were rightly placed;
226,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The head was fixed with proper pose,"
227,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Well fashioned were both ears and nose.
228,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"So close thronged Brownies high and low,"
229,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,A looker-on would hardly know
230,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,What plan or shape the busy band
231,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Of cunning Brownies had in hand.
232,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"But plan they had, and deftness too,"
233,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,As well was seen when they were through.
234,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,The rounded form and manly port
235,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Showed modeling of rarest sort,"
236,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"While charcoal eyes, so well designed"
237,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"They seemed to read the very mind,"
238,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Long icicles for beard and hair,"
239,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Were last affixed with taste and care.
240,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And when the poles around the base
241,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Had been returned each to its place,"
242,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And every ladder, bench, and board"
243,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"They had in use, again was stored,"
244,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,The Brownies stood around awhile
245,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,To gaze upon their work and smile.
246,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Each points at head, or hand, or toe,"
247,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,His special handiwork to show.
248,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"In truth, they had good reason there"
249,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"With joy and pride to stand and stare,"
250,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And contemplate the object white
251,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Which loomed above to such a height,"
252,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And not unlike some hero old,"
253,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"For courage famed, or action bold,"
254,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"With finger pointed out, as though,"
255,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,To indicate the coming foe.
256,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,
257,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,But morning light soon came to chase
258,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,The Brownies to their hiding-place.
259,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,And children on their way to school
260,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Forgot their lessons and the rule
261,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,While gazing on the statue tall
262,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,That seemed to guard the County Hall.
263,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And after drifts had left the square,"
264,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"When roads and shingle-roofs were bare,"
265,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"The Brownies' statue, like a tower,"
266,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,Still bravely faced both wind and shower--
267,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Though sinking slowly all the while,"
268,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"And losing corpulence and style,"
269,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,"Till gardeners, on the first of May,"
270,THE BROWNIES' SNOW MAN.,With shovels pitched the man away.

1873,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,"I watched them closely at their fun,"

1875,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,"The younger members took the lead,"
1876,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,And carried on the work with speed.
1877,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,With nimble feet they ran about
1878,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,"From place to place, with laugh and shout;"

1883,THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.,"They placed the sugar in a pot,"
