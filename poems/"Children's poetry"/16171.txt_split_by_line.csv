63,BY CLARA DOTY BATES,As he whittled came a sigh:

72,BY CLARA DOTY BATES,And yet nothing suited him

103,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
104,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
105,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,[[I]]t was sad and it was strange!
106,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He just was full of knowledge,"
107,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,His studies swept the whole broad range
108,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Of High School and of College;
109,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He read in Greek and Latin too,"
110,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Loud Sanscrit he could utter,"
111,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,But one small thing he couldn't do
112,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,That comes as pat to me and you
113,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,As eating bread and butter:
114,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He couldn't say ""No!"" He couldn't say ""No!"""
115,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,I'm sorry to say it was really so!
116,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd diddle, and dawdle, and stutter, but oh!"
117,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"When it came to the point he could never say ""No!"""
118,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
119,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Geometry he knew by rote,"
120,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Like any Harvard Proctor;
121,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd sing a fugue out, note by note;"
122,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Knew Physics like a Doctor;
123,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He spoke in German and in French;
124,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Knew each Botanic table;
125,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,But one small word that you'll agree
126,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Comes pat enough to you and me,"
127,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,To speak he was not able:
128,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"For he couldn't say ""No!"" He couldn't say ""No!"""
129,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"'Tis dreadful, of course, but 'twas really so."
130,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd diddle, and dawdle, and stutter, but oh!"
131,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"When it came to the point he could never say ""No!"""
132,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
133,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"And he could fence, and swim, and float,"
134,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"And use the gloves with ease too,"
135,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Could play base ball, and row a boat,"
136,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,And hang on a trapeze too;
137,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"His temper was beyond rebuke,"
138,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,And nothing made him lose it;
139,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"His strength was something quite superb,"
140,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,But what's the use of having nerve
141,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,If one can never use it?
142,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He couldn't say ""No!"" He couldn't say ""No!"""
143,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"If one asked him to come, if one asked him to go,"

145,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"When it came to the point he could never say ""No!"""
146,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
147,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"When he was but a little lad,"
148,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"In life's small ways progressing,"
149,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He fell into this habit bad
150,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Of always acquiescing;
151,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"'Twas such an amiable trait,"
152,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"To friend as well as stranger,"
153,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,That half unconsciously at last
154,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,The custom held him hard and fast
155,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Before he knew the danger,"
156,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"And he couldn't say ""No!"" He couldn't say ""No!"""
157,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,To his prospects you see 'twas a terrible blow.

160,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
161,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,And so for all his weary days
162,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,The best of chances failed him;
163,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He lived in strange and troublous ways
164,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,And never knew what ailed him;
165,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He'd go to skate when ice was thin;
166,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd join in deeds unlawful,"
167,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd lend his name to worthless notes,"
168,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He'd speculate in stocks and oats;
169,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"'Twas positively awful,"
170,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"For he couldn't say ""No!"" He couldn't say ""No!"""
171,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,He would veer like a weather-cock turning so slow;
172,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"He'd diddle, and dawdle, and stutter, but oh!"
173,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"When it came to the point he could never say ""No!"""
174,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,
175,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Then boys and girls who hear my song,"
176,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Pray heed its theme alarming:
177,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Be good, be wise, be kind, be strong--"
178,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"These traits are always charming,"
179,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"But all your learning, all your skill"
180,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"With well-trained brain and muscle,"
181,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"Might just as well be left alone,"

183,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"To help you in life's tussle,"
184,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"And learn to say ""No!"" Yes, learn to say ""No!"""
185,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,Or you'll fall from the heights to the rapids below!
186,HE COULDN'T SAY NO.,"You may waver, and falter, and tremble, but oh!"

196,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.
197,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
198,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
199,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,All children have wondered unceasingly from their very first Christmas
200,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"up to their very last Christmas, where the Christmas presents come"
201,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,from. It is very easy to say that Santa Claus brought them. All well
202,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"regulated people know that, of course; about the reindeer, and the"
203,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"sledge, and the pack crammed with toys, the chimney, and all the rest"
204,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"of it--that is all true, of course, and everybody knows about it; but"
205,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"that is not the question which puzzles. What children want to know is,"
206,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,where do these Christmas presents come from in the first place? Where
207,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"does Santa Claus get them? Well, the answer to that is, _In the garden"
208,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,of the Christmas Monks_. This has not been known until very lately;
209,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"that is, it has not been known till very lately except in the"
210,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"immediate vicinity of the Christmas Monks. There, of course, it has"
211,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,been known for ages. It is rather an out-of-the-way place; and that
212,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,accounts for our never hearing of it before.
213,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
214,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,The Convent of the Christmas Monks is a most charmingly picturesque
215,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"pile of old buildings; there are towers and turrets, and peaked roofs"
216,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"and arches, and everything which could possibly be thought of the"
217,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"architectural line, to make a convent picturesque. It is built"
218,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,of graystone; but it is only once in a while that you can see the
219,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"graystone, for the walls are almost completely covered with mistletoe"
220,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and ivy and evergreen. There are the most delicious little arched
221,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,windows with diamond panes peeping out from the mistletoe and
222,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"evergreen, and always at all times of the year, a little Christmas"
223,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,wreath of ivy and holly-berries is suspended in the centre of every
224,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"window. Over all the doors, which are likewise arched, are Christmas"
225,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"garlands, and over the main entrance _Merry Christmas_ in evergreen"
226,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,letters.
227,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
228,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,The Christmas Monks are a jolly brethren; the robes of their order
229,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"are white, gilded with green garlands, and they never are seen out at"
230,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,any time of the year without Christmas wreaths on their heads. Every
231,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,morning they file in a long procession into the chapel to sing a
232,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Christmas carol; and every evening they ring a Christmas chime on the
233,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,convent bells. They eat roast turkey and plum pudding and mince-pie
234,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,for dinner all the year round; and always carry what is left in
235,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,baskets trimmed with evergreen to the poor people. There are always
236,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,wax candles lighted and set in every window of the convent at
237,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,nightfall; and when the people in the country about get uncommonly
238,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"blue and down-hearted, they always go for a cure to look at the"
239,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Convent of the Christmas Monks after the candles are lighted and the
240,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,chimes are ringing. It brings to mind things which never fail to cheer
241,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,them.
242,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
243,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,But the principal thing about the Convent of the Christmas Monks is
244,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the garden; for that is where the Christmas presents grow. This garden
245,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"extends over a large number of acres, and is divided into different"
246,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"departments, just as we divide our flower and vegetable gardens;"
247,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"one bed for onions, one for cabbages, and one for phlox, and one for"
248,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"verbenas, etc."
249,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
250,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Every spring the Christmas Monks go out to sow the Christmas-present
251,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,seeds after they have ploughed the ground and made it all ready.
252,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
253,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,There is one enormous bed devoted to rocking-horses. The rocking-horse
254,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,seed is curious enough; just little bits of rocking-horses so small
255,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"that they can only be seen through a very, very powerful microscope."
256,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The Monks drop these at quite a distance from each other, so that they"
257,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,will not interfere while growing; then they cover them up neatly with
258,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"earth, and put up a sign-post with ""Rocking-horses"" on it in evergreen"
259,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"letters. Just so with the penny-trumpet seed, and the toy-furniture"
260,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"seed, the skate-seed, the sled-seed, and all the others."
261,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
262,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Perhaps the prettiest, and most interesting part of the garden, is"
263,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,that devoted to wax dolls. There are other beds for the commoner
264,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"dolls--for the rag dolls, and the china dolls, and the rubber dolls,"
265,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,but of course wax dolls would look much handsomer growing. Wax dolls
266,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,have to be planted quite early in the season; for they need a good
267,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,start before the sun is very high. The seeds are the loveliest bits
268,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,of microscopic dolls imaginable. The Monks sow them pretty close
269,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"together, and they begin to come up by the middle of May. There is"
270,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"first just a little glimmer of gold, or flaxen, or black, or brown, as"
271,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the case may be, above the soil. Then the snowy foreheads appear, and"
272,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the blue eyes, and the black eyes, and, later on, all those enchanting"
273,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"little heads are out of the ground, and are nodding and winking and"
274,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,smiling to each other the whole extent of the field; with their pinky
275,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,cheeks and sparkling eyes and curly hair there is nothing so pretty as
276,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"these little wax doll heads peeping out of the earth. Gradually, more"
277,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"and more of them come to light, and finally by Christmas they are all"
278,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"ready to gather. There they stand, swaying to and fro, and dancing"
279,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"lightly on their slender feet which are connected with the ground,"
280,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"each by a tiny green stem; their dresses of pink, or blue, or"
281,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,white--for their dresses grow with them--flutter in the air. Just
282,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,about the prettiest sight in the world is the bed of wax dolls in the
283,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,garden of the Christmas Monks at Christmas time. Of course ever since
284,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,this convent and garden were established (and that was so long ago
285,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,that the wisest man can find no books about it) their glories have
286,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,attracted a vast deal of admiration and curiosity from the young
287,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,people in the surrounding country; but as the garden is enclosed on
288,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"all sides by an immensely thick and high hedge, which no boy could"
289,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"climb, or peep over, they could only judge of the garden by the fruits"
290,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,which were parceled out to them on Christmas-day.
291,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
292,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"You can judge, then, of the sensation among the young folks, and older"
293,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"ones, for that matter, when one evening there appeared hung upon a"
294,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"conspicuous place in the garden-hedge, a broad strip of white cloth"
295,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,trimmed with evergreen and printed with the following notice in
296,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,evergreen letters:
297,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
298,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""WANTED--By the Christmas Monks, two _good_ boys to assist in garden"
299,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"work. Applicants will be examined by Fathers Anselmus and Ambrose, in"
300,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the convent refectory, on April 10th."""
301,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
302,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"This notice was hung out about five o'clock in the evening, some time"
303,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,in the early part of February. By noon the street was so full of boys
304,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"staring at it with their mouths wide open, so as to see better, that"
305,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the king was obliged to send his bodyguard before him to clear the
306,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"way with brooms, when he wanted to pass on his way from his chamber of"
307,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,state to his palace.
308,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
309,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,There was not a boy in the country but looked upon this position as
310,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the height of human felicity. To work all the year in that wonderful
311,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"garden, and see those wonderful things growing! and without doubt any"
312,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"body who worked there could have all the toys he wanted, just as a boy"
313,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,who works in a candy-shop always has all the candy he wants!
314,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
315,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"But the great difficulty, of course, was about the degree of goodness"
316,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,requisite to pass the examination. The boys in this country were no
317,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"worse than the boys in other countries, but there were not many of"
318,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,them that would not have done a little differently if he had only
319,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"known beforehand of the advertisement of the Christmas Monks. However,"
320,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"they made the most of the time remaining, and were so good all over"
321,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the kingdom that a very millennium seemed dawning. The school teachers
322,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"used their ferrules for fire wood, and the king ordered all the birch"
323,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"trees cut down and exported, as he thought there would be no more call"
324,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,for them in his own realm.
325,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
326,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,[Illustration: The boys read the notice.]
327,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
328,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"When the time for the examination drew near, there were two boys whom"
329,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"every one thought would obtain the situation, although some of the"
330,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,other boys had lingering hopes for themselves; if only the Monks would
331,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"examine them on the last six weeks, they thought they might pass."
332,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Still all the older people had decided in their minds that the Monks
333,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"would choose these two boys. One was the Prince, the king's oldest"
334,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,son; and the other was a poor boy named Peter. The Prince was no
335,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"better than the other boys; indeed, to tell the truth, he was not so"
336,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"good; in fact, was the biggest rogue in the whole country; but all"
337,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the lords and the ladies, and all the people who admired the lords and"
338,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"ladies, said it was their solemn belief that the Prince was the best"
339,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,boy in the whole kingdom; and they were prepared to give in their
340,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"testimony, one and all, to that effect to the Christmas Monks."
341,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
342,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Peter was really and truly such a good boy that there was no excuse
343,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,for saying he was not. His father and mother were poor people; and
344,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Peter worked every minute out of school hours to help them along.
345,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Then he had a sweet little crippled sister whom he was never tired of
346,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"caring for. Then, too, he contrived to find time to do lots of little"
347,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"kindnesses for other people. He always studied his lessons faithfully,"
348,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"and never ran away from school. Peter was such a good boy, and so"
349,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"modest and unsuspicious that he was good, that everybody loved him. He"
350,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,had not the least idea that he could get the place with the Christmas
351,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Monks, but the Prince was sure of it."
352,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
353,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"When the examination day came all the boys from far and near, with"
354,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"their hair neatly brushed and parted, and dressed in their best"
355,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"clothes, flocked into the convent. Many of their relatives and friends"
356,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,went with them to witness the examination.
357,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
358,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The refectory of the convent, where they assembled, was a very large"
359,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,hall with a delicious smell of roast turkey and plum pudding in it.
360,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"All the little boys sniffed, and their mouths watered."
361,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
362,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,The two fathers who were to examine the boys were perched up in a
363,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,high pulpit so profusely trimmed with evergreen that it looked like a
364,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"bird's nest; they were remarkably pleasant-looking men, and their eyes"
365,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,twinkled merrily under their Christmas wreaths. Father Anselmus was
366,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"a little the taller of the two, and Father Ambrose was a little the"
367,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,broader; and that was about all the difference between them in looks.
368,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
369,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,[Illustration: The Prince & Peter are examined by the Monks.]
370,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
371,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The little boys all stood up in a row, their friends stationed"
372,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"themselves in good places, and the examination began."
373,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
374,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Then if one had been placed beside the entrance to the convent, he"
375,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"would have seen one after another, a crestfallen little boy with his"
376,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"arm lifted up and crooked, and his face hidden in it, come out and"
377,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,walk forlornly away. He had failed to pass.
378,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
379,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The two fathers found out that this boy had robbed birds' nests,"
380,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and this one stolen apples. And one after another they walked
381,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,disconsolately away till there were only two boys left: the Prince and
382,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Peter.
383,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
384,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Now, your Highness,"" said Father Anselmus, who always took the lead"
385,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"in the questions, ""are you a good boy?"""
386,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
387,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""O holy Father!"" exclaimed all the people--there were a good many fine"
388,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"folks from the court present. ""He is such a good boy! such a wonderful"
389,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"boy! We never knew him to do a wrong thing in his sweet life."""
390,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
391,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""I don't suppose he ever robbed a bird's nest?"" said Father Ambrose a"
392,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,little doubtfully.
393,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
394,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""No, no!"" chorused the people."
395,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
396,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Nor tormented a kitten?"""
397,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
398,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""No, no, no!"" cried they all."
399,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
400,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,At last everybody being so confident that here could be no reasonable
401,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"fault found with the Prince, he was pronounced competent to enter upon"
402,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the Monks' service. Peter they knew a great deal about before--indeed,"
403,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,a glance at his face was enough to satisfy any one of his goodness;
404,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,for he did look more like one of the boy angels in the altar-piece
405,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"than anything else. So after a few questions, they accepted him also;"
406,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and the people went home and left the two boys with the Christmas
407,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Monks.
408,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
409,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The next morning Peter was obliged to lay aside his homespun coat,"
410,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"and the Prince his velvet tunic, and both were dressed in some little"
411,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,white robes with evergreen girdles like the Monks. Then the Prince
412,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"was set to sowing Noah's ark seed, and Peter picture-book seed. Up"
413,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and down they went scattering the seed. Peter sang a little psalm
414,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"to himself, but the Prince grumbled because they had not given him"
415,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,gold-watch or gem seed to plant instead of the toy which he had
416,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"outgrown long ago. By noon Peter had planted all his picture-books,"
417,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and fastened up the card to mark them on the pole; but the Prince had
418,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,dawdled so his work was not half done.
419,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
420,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""We are going to have a trial with this boy,"" said the Monks to each"
421,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"other; ""we shall have to set him a penance at once, or we cannot"
422,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"manage him at all."""
423,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
424,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"So the Prince had to go without his dinner, and kneel on dried peas in"
425,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the chapel all the afternoon. The next day he finished his Noah's Arks
426,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,meekly; but the next day he rebelled again and had to go the whole
427,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"length of the field where they planted jewsharps, on his knees. And so"
428,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,it was about every other day for the whole year.
429,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
430,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,One of the brothers had to be set apart in a meditating cell to invent
431,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,new penances; for they had used up all on their list before the Prince
432,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,had been with them three months.
433,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
434,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The Prince became dreadfully tired of his convent life, and if"
435,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"he could have brought it about would have run away. Peter, on the"
436,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"contrary, had never been so happy in his life. He worked like a bee,"
437,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and the pleasure he took in seeing the lovely things he had planted
438,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"come up, was unbounded, and the Christmas carols and chimes delighted"
439,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"his soul. Then, too, he had never fared so well in his life. He could"
440,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,never remember the time before when he had been a whole week without
441,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,being hungry. He sent his wages every month to his parents; and he
442,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,never ceased to wonder at the discontent of the Prince.
443,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
444,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""They grow so slow,"" the Prince would say, wrinkling up his handsome"
445,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"forehead. ""I expected to have a bushelful of new toys every month; and"
446,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,not one have I had yet. And these stingy old Monks say I can only have
447,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"my usual Christmas share anyway, nor can I pick them out myself. I"
448,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,never saw such a stupid place to stay in my life. I want to have my
449,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,velvet tunic on and go home to the palace and ride on my white pony
450,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"with the silver tail, and hear them all tell me how charming I am."""
451,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Then the Prince would crook his arm and put his head on it and cry.
452,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
453,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Peter pitied him, and tried to comfort him, but it was not of much"
454,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"use, for the Prince got angry because he was not discontented as well"
455,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,as himself.
456,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
457,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Two weeks before Christmas everything in the garden was nearly ready
458,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"to be picked. Some few things needed a little more December sun, but"
459,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,everything looked perfect. Some of the Jack-in-the-boxes would not
460,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"pop out quite quick enough, and some of the jumping-Jacks were hardly"
461,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,as limber as they might be as yet; that was all. As it was so near
462,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Christmas the Monks were engaged in their holy exercises in the chapel
463,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"for the greater part of the time, and only went over the garden once a"
464,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,day to see if everything was all right.
465,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
466,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,The Prince and Peter were obliged to be there all the time. There was
467,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,plenty of work for them to do; for once in a while something would
468,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"blow over, and then there were the penny-trumpets to keep in tune; and"
469,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,that was a vast sight of work.
470,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
471,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,One morning the Prince was at one end of the garden straightening up
472,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"some wooden soldiers which had toppled over, and Peter was in the wax"
473,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,doll bed dusting the dolls. All of a sudden he heard a sweet little
474,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"voice: ""O, Peter!"" He thought at first one of the dolls was talking,"
475,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,but they could not say anything but papa and mamma; and had the merest
476,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"apologies for voices anyway. ""Here I am, Peter!"" and there was a"
477,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,little pull at his sleeve. There was his little sister. She was not
478,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"any taller than the dolls around her, and looked uncommonly like the"
479,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"prettiest, pinkest-cheeked, yellowest-haired ones; so it was no wonder"
480,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,that Peter did not see her at first. She stood there poising herself
481,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"on her crutches, poor little thing, and smiling lovingly up at Peter."
482,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
483,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Oh, you darling!"" cried Peter, catching her up in his arms. ""How did"
484,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"you get in here?"""
485,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
486,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""I stole in behind one of the Monks,"" said she. ""I saw him going up"
487,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the street past our house, and I ran out and kept behind him all the"
488,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"way. When he opened the gate I whisked in too, and then I followed him"
489,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"into the garden. I've been here with the dollies ever since."""
490,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
491,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Well,"" said poor Peter, ""I don't see what I am going to do with you,"
492,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,now you are here. I can't let you out again; and I don't know what the
493,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Monks will say."""
494,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
495,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Oh, I know!"" cried the little girl gayly. ""I'll stay out here in"
496,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the garden. I can sleep in one of those beautiful dolls' cradles over
497,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"there; and you can bring me something to eat."""
498,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
499,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,[Illustration: The boys at work in the Convent Garden.]
500,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
501,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""But the Monks come out every morning to look over the garden, and"
502,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"they'll be sure to find you,"" said her brother, anxiously."
503,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
504,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""No, I'll hide! O Peter, here is a place where there isn't any doll!"""
505,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
506,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Yes; that doll did not come up."""
507,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
508,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Well, I'll tell you what I'll do! I'll just stand here in this place"
509,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"where the doll didn't come up, and nobody can tell the difference."""
510,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
511,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Well, I don't know but you can do that,"" said Peter, although he was"
512,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,still ill at ease. He was so good a boy he was very much afraid of
513,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"doing wrong, and offending his kind friends the Monks; at the same"
514,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,time he could not help being glad to see his dear little sister.
515,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
516,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"He smuggled some food out to her, and she played merrily about him all"
517,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,day; and at night he tucked her into one of the dolls' cradles with
518,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,lace pillows and quilt of rose-colored silk.
519,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
520,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The next morning when the Monks were going the rounds, the father who"
521,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"inspected the wax doll bed was a bit nearsighted, and he never noticed"
522,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the difference between the dolls and Peter's little sister, who swung"
523,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"herself on her crutches, and looked just as much like a wax doll as"
524,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,she possibly could. So the two were delighted with the success of
525,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,their plan.
526,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
527,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"They went on thus for a few days, and Peter could not help being happy"
528,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"with his darling little sister, although at the same time he could not"
529,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,help worrying for fear he was doing wrong.
530,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
531,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Something else happened now, which made him worry still more;"
532,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the Prince ran away. He had been watching for a long time for an
533,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,opportunity to possess himself of a certain long ladder made of
534,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"twisted evergreen ropes, which the Monks kept locked up in the"
535,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"toolhouse. Lately, by some oversight, the toolhouse had been left"
536,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"unlocked one day, and the Prince got the ladder. It was the latter"
537,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"part of the afternoon, and the Christmas Monks were all in the chapel"
538,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"practicing Christmas carols. The Prince found a very large hamper,"
539,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,and picked as many Christmas presents for himself as he could stuff
540,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,into it; then he put the ladder against the high gate in front of
541,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"the convent, and climbed up, dragging the hamper after him. When he"
542,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"reached the top of the gate, which was quite broad, he sat down to"
543,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,rest for a moment before pulling the ladder up so as to drop it on the
544,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,other side.
545,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
546,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,He gave his feet a little triumphant kick as he looked back at his
547,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"prison, and down slid the evergreen ladder! The Prince lost his"
548,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"balance, and would inevitably have broken his neck if he had not clung"
549,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,desperately to the hamper which hung over on the convent side of the
550,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"fence; and as it was just the same weight as the Prince, it kept him"
551,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,suspended on the other.
552,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
553,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,He screamed with all the force of his royal lungs; was heard by a
554,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"party of noblemen who were galloping up the street; was rescued, and"
555,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,carried in state to the palace. But he was obliged to drop the hamper
556,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"of presents, for with it all the ingenuity of the noblemen could not"
557,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,rescue him as speedily as it was necessary they should.
558,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
559,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,When the good Monks discovered the escape of the Prince they were
560,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"greatly grieved, for they had tried their best to do well by him; and"
561,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,poor Peter could with difficulty be comforted. He had been very fond
562,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"of the Prince, although the latter had done little except torment him"
563,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,for the whole year; but Peter had a way of being fond of folks.
564,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
565,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"A few days after the Prince ran away, and the day before the one on"
566,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"which the Christmas presents were to be gathered, the nearsighted"
567,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,father went out into the wax doll field again; but this time he had
568,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"his spectacles on, and could see just as well as any one, and even"
569,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,a little better. Peter's little sister was swinging herself on her
570,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"crutches, in the place where the wax doll did not come up, tipping her"
571,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"little face up, and smiling just like the dolls around her."
572,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
573,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Why, what is this!"" said the father. ""_Hoc credam!_ I thought that"
574,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,wax doll did not come up. Can my eyes deceive me? _non verum est!_
575,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"There is a doll there--and what a doll! on crutches, and in poor,"
576,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"homely gear!"""
577,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
578,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Then the nearsighted father put out his hand toward Peter's little
579,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"sister. She jumped--she could not help it, and the holy father jumped"
580,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,too; the Christmas wreath actually tumbled off his head.
581,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
582,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""It is a miracle!"" exclaimed he when he could speak; ""the little girl"
583,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,is alive! _parra puella viva est._ I will pick her and take her to the
584,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"brethren, and we will pay her the honors she is entitled to."""
585,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
586,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Then the good father put on his Christmas wreath, for he dare not"
587,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"venture before his abbot without it, picked up Peter's little sister,"
588,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"who was trembling in all her little bones, and carried her into the"
589,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"chapel, where the Monks were just assembling to sing another carol."
590,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"He went right up to the Christmas abbot, who was seated in a splendid"
591,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"chair, and looked like a king."
592,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
593,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Most holy abbot,"" said the nearsighted father, holding out Peter's"
594,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"little sister, ""behold a miracle, _vide miraculum_! Thou wilt remember"
595,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"that there was one wax doll planted which did not come up. Behold, in"
596,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"her place I have found this doll on crutches, which is--alive!"""
597,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
598,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Let me see her!"" said the abbot; and all the other Monks crowded"
599,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"around, opening their mouths just like the little boys around the"
600,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"notice, in order to see better."
601,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
602,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""_Verum est_,"" said the abbot. ""It is verily a miracle."""
603,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
604,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Rather a lame miracle,"" said the brother who had charge of the funny"
605,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,picture-books and the toy monkeys; they rather threw his mind off
606,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"its level of sobriety, and he was apt to make frivolous speeches"
607,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,unbecoming a monk.
608,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
609,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The abbot gave him a reproving glance, and the brother, who was the"
610,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"leach of the convent, came forward. ""Let me look at the miracle, most"
611,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"holy abbot,"" said he. He took up Peter's sister, and looked carefully"
612,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"at the small, twisted ankle. ""I think I can cure this with my herbs"
613,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"and simples,"" said he."
614,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
615,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""But I don't know,"" said the abbot doubtfully. ""I never heard of"
616,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"curing a miracle."""
617,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
618,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""If it is not lawful, my humble power will not suffice to cure it,"""
619,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,said the father who was the leach.
620,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
621,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""True,"" said the abbot; ""take her, then, and exercise thy healing art"
622,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"upon her, and we will go on with our Christmas devotions, for which we"
623,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"should now feel all the more zeal."""
624,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
625,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"So the father took away Peter's little sister, who was still too"
626,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,frightened to speak.
627,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
628,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"The Christmas Monk was a wonderful doctor, for by Christmas eve"
629,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,the little girl was completely cured of her lameness. This may seem
630,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"incredible, but it was owing in great part to the herbs and simples,"
631,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,which are of a species that our doctors have no knowledge of; and also
632,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,to a wonderful lotion which has never been advertised on our fences.
633,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
634,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Peter of course heard the talk about the miracle, and knew at once"
635,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,what it meant. He was almost heartbroken to think he was deceiving the
636,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"Monks so, but at the same time he did not dare to confess the truth"
637,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"for fear they would put a penance upon his sister, and he could not"
638,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,bear to think of her having to kneel upon dried peas.
639,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
640,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,[Illustration: The Prince Runs Away.]
641,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
642,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"He worked hard picking Christmas presents, and hid his unhappiness"
643,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,as best he could. On Christmas eve he was called into the chapel. The
644,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Christmas Monks were all assembled there. The walls were covered with
645,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"green garlands and boughs and sprays of holly berries, and branches"
646,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,of wax lights Were gleaming brightly amongst them. The altar and the
647,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,picture of the Blessed Child behind it were so bright as to almost
648,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"dazzle one; and right up in the midst of it, in a lovely white dress,"
649,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"all wreaths and jewels, in a little chair with a canopy woven of green"
650,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"branches over it, sat Peter's little sister."
651,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
652,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,And there were all the Christmas Monks in their white robes and
653,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"wreaths, going up in a long procession, with their hands full of the"
654,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,very showiest Christmas presents to offer them to her!
655,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
656,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,But when they reached her and held out the lovely presents--the
657,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"first was an enchanting wax doll, the biggest beauty in the whole"
658,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"garden--instead of reaching out her hands for them, she just drew"
659,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"back, and said in her little sweet, piping voice: ""Please, I ain't a"
660,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"millacle, I'm only Peter's little sister."""
661,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
662,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Peter?"" said the abbot; ""the Peter who works in our garden?"""
663,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
664,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""Yes,"" said the little sister."
665,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
666,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Now here was a fine opportunity for a whole convent full of monks to
667,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,look foolish--filing up in procession with their hands full of gifts
668,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"to offer to a miracle, and finding there was no miracle, but only"
669,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,Peter's little sister.
670,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
671,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,But the abbot of the Christmas Monks had always maintained that there
672,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,were two ways of looking at all things; if any object was not what you
673,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"wanted it to be in one light, that there was another light in which it"
674,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,would be sure to meet your views.
675,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
676,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,So now he brought this philosophy to bear.
677,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
678,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"""This little girl did not come up in the place of the wax doll, and"
679,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"she is not a miracle in that light,"" said he; ""but look at her in"
680,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"another light and she is a miracle--do you not see?"""
681,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,
682,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"They all looked at her, the darling little girl, the very meaning and"
683,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"sweetness of all Christmas in her loving, trusting, innocent face."
684,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,

697,THE CHRISTMAS MONKS.,"As for the Prince, the courtiers were never tired of discussing and"

843,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
844,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
845,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,It was a thoroughly disagreeable March morning. The wind blew in sharp
846,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,gusts from every quarter of the compass by turns. It seemed to take
847,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,especial delight in rushing suddenly around corners and taking away
848,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,the breath of anybody it could catch there coming from the opposite
849,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"direction. The dust, too, filled people's eyes and noses and mouths,"
850,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,while the damp raw March air easily found its way through the best
851,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"clothing, and turned boys' skins into pimply goose-flesh."
852,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
853,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,It was about as disagreeable a morning for going out as can be
854,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,imagined; and yet everybody in the little Western river town who could
855,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,get out went out and stayed out.
856,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
857,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Men and women, boys and girls, and even little children, ran to the"
858,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"river-bank: and, once there, they stayed, with no thought, it seemed,"
859,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,of going back to their homes or their work.
860,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
861,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"The people of the town were wild with excitement, and everybody told"
862,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"everybody else what had happened, although everybody knew all about"
863,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"it already. Everybody, I mean, except Joe Lambert, and he had been so"
864,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"busy ever since daylight, sawing wood in Squire Grisard's woodshed,"
865,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,that he had neither seen nor heard anything at all. Joe was the
866,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,poorest person in the town. He was the only boy there who really had
867,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,no home and nobody to care for him. Three or four years before
868,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"this March morning, Joe had been left an orphan, and being utterly"
869,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"destitute, he should have been sent to the poorhouse, or ""bound out"""
870,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,to some person as a sort of servant. But Joe Lambert had refused to go
871,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,to the poorhouse or to become a bound boy. He had declared his ability
872,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"to take care of himself, and by working hard at odd jobs, sawing"
873,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"wood, rolling barrels on the wharf, picking apples or weeding onions"
874,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"as opportunity offered, he had managed to support himself ""after a"
875,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"manner,"" as the village people said. That is to say, he generally got"
876,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"enough to eat, and some clothes to wear. He slept in a warehouse shed,"
877,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,the owner having given him leave to do so on condition that he would
878,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,act as a sort of watchman on the premises.
879,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
880,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Joe Lambert alone of all the villagers knew nothing of what had
881,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,happened; and of course Joe Lambert did not count for anything in the
882,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,estimation of people who had houses to live in. The only reason I have
883,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,gone out of the way to make an exception of so unimportant a person
884,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"is, that I think Joe did count for something on that particular March"
885,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,day at least.
886,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
887,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"When he finished the pile of wood that he had to saw, and went to the"
888,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"house to get his money, he found nobody there. Going down the street"
889,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"he found the town empty, and, looking down a cross street, he saw the"
890,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"crowds that had gathered on the river-bank, thus learning at last that"
891,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,something unusual had occurred. Of course he ran to the river to learn
892,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,what it was.
893,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
894,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,When he got there he learned that Noah Martin the fisherman who was
895,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,also the ferryman between the village and its neighbor on the other
896,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"side of the river, had been drowned during the early morning in a"
897,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,foolish attempt to row his ferry skiff across the stream. The ice
898,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"which had blocked the river for two months, had begun to move on the"
899,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"day before, and Martin with his wife and baby--a child about a year"
900,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,old--were on the other side of the river at the time. Early on that
901,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,morning there had been a temporary gorging of the ice about a mile
902,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"above the town, and, taking advantage of the comparatively free"
903,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"channel, Martin had tried to cross with his wife and child, in his"
904,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,boat.
905,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
906,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"The gorge had broken up almost immediately, as the river was rising"
907,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"rapidly, and Martin's boat had been caught and crushed in the ice."
908,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Martin had been drowned, but his wife, with her child in her arms, had"
909,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"clung to the wreck of the skiff, and had been carried by the current"
910,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,to a little low-lying island just in front of the town.
911,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
912,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"What had happened was of less importance, however, than what people"
913,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"saw must happen. The poor woman and baby out there on the island,"
914,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"drenched as they had been in the icy water, must soon die with cold,"
915,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"and, moreover, the island was now nearly under water, while the great"
916,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,stream was rising rapidly. It was evident that within an hour or two
917,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the water would sweep over the whole surface of the island, and the"
918,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,great fields of ice would of course carry the woman and child to a
919,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,terrible death.
920,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
921,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Many wild suggestions were made for their rescue, but none that gave"
922,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,the least hope of success. It was simply impossible to launch a boat.
923,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"The vast fields of ice, two or three feet in thickness, and from"
924,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"twenty feet to a hundred yards in breadth, were crushing and grinding"
925,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"down the river at the rate of four or five miles an hour, turning and"
926,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"twisting about, sometimes jamming their edges together with so great"
927,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"a force that one would lap over another, and sometimes drifting apart"
928,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and leaving wide open spaces between for a moment or two. One might as
929,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,well go upon such a river in an egg shell as in the stoutest row-boat
930,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,ever built.
931,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
932,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"The poor woman with her babe could be seen from the shore, standing"
933,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,there alone on the rapidly narrowing strip of island. Her voice could
934,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"not reach the people on the bank, but when she held her poor little"
935,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"baby toward them in mute appeal for help, the mothers there understood"
936,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,her agony.
937,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
938,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"There was nothing to be done, however. Human sympathy was given"
939,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"freely, but human help was out of the question. Everybody on the"
940,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"river-shore was agreed in that opinion. Everybody, that is to say,"
941,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,except Joe Lambert. He had been so long in the habit of finding ways
942,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"to help himself under difficulties, that he did not easily make up his"
943,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,mind to think any case hopeless.
944,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
945,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,No sooner did Joe clearly understand how matters stood than he ran
946,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"away from the crowd, nobody paying any attention to what he did. Half"
947,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"an hour later somebody cried out: ""Look there! Who's that, and what's"
948,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"he going to do?"" pointing up the stream."
949,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
950,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Looking in that direction, the people saw some one three quarters of"
951,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,a mile away standing on a floating field of ice in the river. He had
952,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"a large farm-basket strapped upon his shoulders, while in his hands he"
953,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,held a plank.
954,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
955,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"As the ice-field upon which he stood neared another, the youth ran"
956,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"forward, threw his plank down, making a bridge of it, and crossed to"
957,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the farther field. Then picking up his plank, he waited for a chance"
958,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,to repeat the process.
959,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
960,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"As he thus drifted down the river, every eye was strained in his"
961,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"direction. Presently some one cried out: ""It's Joe Lambert; and he's"
962,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"trying to cross to the island!"""
963,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
964,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,There was a shout as the people understood the nature of Joe's heroic
965,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"attempt, and then a hush as its extreme danger became apparent."
966,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
967,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Joe had laid his plans wisely and well, but it seemed impossible that"
968,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"he could succeed. His purpose was, with the aid of the plank to cross"
969,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,from one ice-field to another until he should reach the island; but
970,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"as that would require a good deal of time, and the ice was moving down"
971,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"stream pretty rapidly, it was necessary to start at a point above the"
972,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"town. Joe had gone about a mile up the river before going on the ice,"
973,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and when first seen from the town he had already reached the channel.
974,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
975,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,After that first shout a whisper might have been heard in the crowd on
976,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the bank. The heroism of the poor boy's attempt awed the spectators,"
977,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and the momentary expectation that he would disappear forever amid
978,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the crushing ice-fields, made them hold their breath in anxiety and"
979,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,terror.
980,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
981,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,His greatest danger was from the smaller cakes of ice. When it became
982,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"necessary for him to step upon one of these, his weight was sufficient"
983,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"to make it tilt, and his footing was very insecure. After awhile as"
984,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"he was nearing the island, he came into a large collection of these"
985,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"smaller ice-cakes. For awhile he waited, hoping that a larger field"
986,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,would drift near him; but after a minute's delay he saw that he
987,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"was rapidly floating past the island, and that he must either trust"
988,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"himself to the treacherous broken ice, or fail in his attempt to save"
989,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,the woman and child.
990,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
991,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,[Illustration: Joe Saves Mrs. Martin and Baby Martin.]
992,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
993,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Choosing the best of the floes, he laid his plank and passed across"
994,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"successfully. In the next passage, however, the cake tilted up, and"
995,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Joe Lambert went down into the water! A shudder passed through the
996,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,crowd on shore.
997,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
998,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""Poor fellow!"" exclaimed some tender-hearted spectator; ""it is all"
999,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"over with him now."""
1000,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1001,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""No; look, look!"" shouted another. ""He's trying to climb upon the"
1002,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"ice. Hurrah! he's on his feet again!"" With that the whole company of"
1003,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,spectators shouted for joy.
1004,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1005,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Joe had managed to regain his plank as well as to climb upon a cake
1006,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"of ice before the fields around could crush him, and now moving"
1007,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"cautiously, he made his way, little by little toward the island."
1008,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1009,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""Hurrah! Hurrah! he's there at last!"" shouted the people on the shore."
1010,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1011,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""But will he get back again?"" was the question each one asked himself"
1012,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,a moment later.
1013,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1014,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Having reached the island, Joe very well knew that the more difficult"
1015,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"part of his task was still before him, for it was one thing for an"
1016,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"active boy to work his way over floating ice, and quite another to"
1017,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,carry a child and lead a woman upon a similar journey.
1018,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1019,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"But Joe Lambert was quick-witted and ""long-headed,"" as well as brave,"
1020,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and he meant to do all that he could to save these poor creatures for
1021,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,whom he had risked his life so heroically. Taking out his knife he
1022,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"made the woman cut her skirts off at the knees, so that she might walk"
1023,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and leap more freely. Then placing the baby in the basket which was
1024,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"strapped upon his back, he cautioned the woman against giving way to"
1025,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"fright, and instructed her carefully about the method of crossing."
1026,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1027,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,On the return journey Joe was able to avoid one great risk. As it
1028,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"was not necessary to land at any particular point, time was of little"
1029,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"consequence, and hence when no large field of ice was at hand, he"
1030,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"could wait for one to approach, without attempting to make use of the"
1031,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"smaller ones. Leading the woman wherever that was necessary, he slowly"
1032,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"made his way toward shore, drifting down the river, of course, while"
1033,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,all the people of the town marched along the bank.
1034,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1035,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"When at last Joe leaped ashore in company with the woman, and bearing"
1036,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"her babe in the basket on his back, the people seemed ready to trample"
1037,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,upon each other in their eagerness to shake hands with their hero.
1038,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1039,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Their hero was barely able to stand, however. Drenched as he had been"
1040,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"in the icy river, the sharp March wind had chilled him to the marrow,"
1041,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and one of the village doctors speedily lifted him into his carriage
1042,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"which he had brought for that purpose, and drove rapidly away, while"
1043,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,the other physician took charge of Mrs. Martin and the baby.
1044,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1045,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Joe was a strong, healthy fellow, and under the doctor's treatment of"
1046,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"hot brandy and vigorous rubbing with coarse towels, he soon warmed."
1047,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Then he wanted to saw enough wood for the doctor to pay for his
1048,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"treatment, and thereupon the doctor threatened to poison him if he"
1049,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,should ever venture to mention pay to him again.
1050,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1051,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Naturally enough the village people talked of nothing but Joe
1052,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Lambert's heroic deed, and the feeling was general that they had never"
1053,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,done their duty toward the poor orphan boy. There was an eager wish to
1054,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"help him now, and many offers were made to him; but these all took the"
1055,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"form of charity, and Joe would not accept charity at all. Four years"
1056,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"earlier, as I have already said, he had refused to go to the poorhouse"
1057,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"or to be ""bound out,"" declaring that he could take care of himself;"
1058,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,and when some thoughtless person had said in his hearing that he would
1059,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"have to live on charity, Joe's reply had been:"
1060,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1061,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""I'll never eat a mouthful in this town that I haven't worked for if"
1062,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"I starve."" And he had kept his word. Now that he was fifteen years old"
1063,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,he was not willing to begin receiving charity even in the form of a
1064,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,reward for his good deed.
1065,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1066,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,One day when some of the most prominent men of the village were
1067,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,talking to him on the subject Joe said:
1068,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1069,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"""I don't want anything except a chance to work, but I'll tell you what"
1070,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,you may do for me if you will. Now that poor Martin is dead the ferry
1071,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"privilege will be to lease again, I'd like to get it for a good long"
1072,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,term. Maybe I can make something out of it by being always ready to
1073,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"row people across, and I may even be able to put on something better"
1074,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"than a skiff after awhile. I'll pay the village what Martin paid."""
1075,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1076,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,The gentlemen were glad enough of a chance to do Joe even this small
1077,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"favor, and there was no difficulty in the way. The authorities gladly"
1078,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"granted Joe a lease of the ferry privilege for twenty years, at twenty"
1079,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"dollars a year rent, which was the rate Martin had paid."
1080,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1081,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"At first Joe rowed people back and forth, saving what money he got"
1082,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"very carefully. This was all that could be required of him, but it"
1083,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"occurred to Joe that if he had a ferry boat big enough, a good many"
1084,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,horses and cattle and a good deal of freight would be sent across the
1085,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"river, for he was a ""long-headed"" fellow as I have said."
1086,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1087,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"One day a chance offered, and he bought for twenty-five dollars a"
1088,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"large old wood boat, which was simply a square barge forty feet long"
1089,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"and fifteen feet wide, with bevelled bow and stern, made to hold cord"
1090,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,wood for the steamboats. With his own hands he laid a stout deck
1091,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"on this, and, with the assistance of a man whom he hired for that"
1092,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"purpose, he constructed a pair of paddle wheels. By that time Joe was"
1093,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"out of money, and work on the boat was suspended for awhile. When"
1094,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"he had accumulated a little more money, he bought a horse power, and"
1095,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"placed it in the middle of his boat, connecting it with the shaft of"
1096,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"his wheels. Then he made a rudder and helm, and his horse-boat was"
1097,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,ready for use. It had cost him about a hundred dollars besides his own
1098,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"labor upon it, but it would carry live stock and freight as well as"
1099,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"passengers, and so the business of the ferry rapidly increased, and"
1100,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Joe began to put a little money away in the bank.
1101,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1102,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"After awhile a railroad was built into the village, and then a second"
1103,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,one came. A year later another railroad was opened on the other side
1104,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"of the river, and all the passengers who came to one village by rail"
1105,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,had to be ferried across the river in order to continue their journey
1106,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,by the railroads there. The horse-boat was too small and too slow for
1107,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the business, and Joe Lambert had to buy two steam ferry-boats to take"
1108,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"its place. These cost more money than he had, but, as the owner of"
1109,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the ferry privilege, his credit was good, and the boats soon paid for"
1110,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"themselves, while Joe's bank account grew again."
1111,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1112,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,Finally the railroad people determined to run through cars for
1113,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"passengers and freight, and to carry them across the river on large"
1114,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,boats built for that purpose; but before they gave their orders
1115,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"to their boat builders, they were waited upon by the attorneys of"
1116,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Joe Lambert, who soon convinced them that his ferry privilege gave"
1117,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,him alone the right to run any kind of ferry-boats between the two
1118,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,villages which had now grown to such size that they called themselves
1119,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,cities. The result was that the railroads made a contract with Joe to
1120,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"carry their cars across, and he had some large boats built for that"
1121,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,purpose.
1122,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,
1123,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"All this occurred a good many years ago, and Joe Lambert is not called"
1124,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"Joe now, but Captain Lambert. He is one of the most prosperous men in"
1125,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"the little river city, and owns many large river steamers besides his"
1126,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,ferry-boats. Nobody is readier than he to help a poor boy or a poor
1127,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,man; but he has his own way of doing it. He will never toss so much as
1128,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,"a cent to a beggar, but he never refuses to give man or boy a chance"
1129,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,to earn money by work. He has an odd theory that money which comes
1130,JOE LAMBERT'S FERRY.,without work does more harm than good.

1187,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"One of the most pleasing of modern English authors, Philip Gilbert"
1188,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Hamerton, who is an artist as well as writer, and who loves animals"
1189,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"almost as he does art, says that it would be interesting for a man to"
1190,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"live permanently in a large hall into which three or four horses, of a"
1191,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"race already intelligent, should be allowed to go and come freely from"
1192,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the time they were born, just as dogs do in a family where they are"
1193,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"pets, or something to that effect. They should have full liberty to"
1194,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"poke their noses in their master's face, or lay their heads on his"
1195,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"shoulder at meal-time, receiving their treat of lettuce or sugar or"
1196,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"bread, only they must understand that they would be punished if they"
1197,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"knocked off the vases or upset furniture, or did other mischief. He"
1198,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"would like to see this tried, and see what would come of it; what"
1199,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"intelligence a horse would develop, and what love."
1200,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1201,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"The plan looks quixotic, does it not? But one thing you may be sure"
1202,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,of; he might have worse associates. There are grades of intellect--we
1203,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"will call it intellect, for it comes very near, _so_ near that we"
1204,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,never can know just where the fine shading off begins between a
1205,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"horse's brain and that of a man; and there are warm, loving equine"
1206,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"hearts. Many horses are superior to many men; nobler, more honorable,"
1207,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"quicker-witted, more loyal, and a thousand times more companionable."
1208,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Would you not rather, if you had to live on Robinson Crusoe's island,"
1209,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"have an intelligent, sympathetic horse and a devoted bright dog than"
1210,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,some people you know? One is inclined to favor Hamerton's notion after

1216,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"I am writing this for boys and girls who love animals, and for those"
1217,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"elderly people who are fond of them too, including the lady whom I"
1218,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,overheard saying that she had been nine times to see the remarkable
1219,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,exhibition. The young folks were enthusiastic patrons of that little
1220,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"theatre in Boston, where for more than a hundred afternoons and"
1221,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"evenings the ""Professor,"" as he was called, showed off his four-footed"
1222,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,pupils. One forenoon he set apart for a free entertainment of as many
1223,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"poor children as the house would hold, who went under the charge of"
1224,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,the truant officers and had an overwhelming good time.
1225,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1226,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"There were sixteen of the animals, counting a donkey; grays, bays,"
1227,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"chestnut-colored beauties, and one who looked buff in the gaslight. In"
1228,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"recalling them, I cannot say that there was a white-footed one. What"
1229,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"consequence about white feet, you ask! Perhaps you know that they"
1230,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,make that of some account in the horse bazaars of the East. The Turks
1231,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"say ""two white fore feet are lucky; one white fore and hind foot are"

1241,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"They were all named. There was a Chevalier, a Prince, and a Pope; a"

1250,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,It is perhaps needless and an insult to their intelligence for me to
1251,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,say that they all know their own names as well as you know yours. They
1252,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"know, too, their numbers when they are acting as soldiers formed in"
1253,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,line waiting orders; the Professor passes along and checking them off
1254,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"with his forefinger numbers them, then falling back, calls out for"
1255,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"certain ones to form into platoons, and they make no mistake. Their"

1267,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,When the curtain rose there was to be seen a small stage carpeted
1268,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"ankle deep with saw-dust, where Professor Bartholomew purposed to have"
1269,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"his horses act; first the part of a school, then of a court room, last"
1270,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"a military drill and taking of a fort. They came in one after another,"
1271,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"pretending, if that is not too strong a word, that they were on the"
1272,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"way to school, and that was the playground; and there they played"
1273,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"together, with such soft, graceful action, such caressing ways, and"
1274,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"trippings as dainty as in ""Pinafore,"" until at the ringing of a bell"
1275,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"they came at once to order from their mixed-up, mazy pastime, and"
1276,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"waited the arrival of their teacher, the Professor, who entered with a"
1277,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"schoolmaster air, and gave the order."
1278,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1279,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"""Bucephalus, take my hat, and bring me a chair!"" as you might tell"
1280,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"James or John to do the same, and with more promptness than they would"
1281,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"have shown, Bucephalus came forward, took the hat between his teeth,"
1282,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"carried it across the stage and placed it on a desk, and brought a"

1290,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,separated themselves from the group huddled together and went as they
1291,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"were bid, while Nellie, the mustang, and other little ones, filed off"
1292,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"to the opposite side, and placed themselves in a row, with their heads"
1293,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"turned away from the stage. And there they remained, generally minding"
1294,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"their business, though sometimes one would get out of position, look"
1295,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"around, or give his neighbor a nudge which brought out a reprimand:"
1296,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"""Pope, what are you doing?"" ""Brutus, you need not look around to see"

1299,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1300,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"He then called for some one to come forward and be monitor, and Prince"
1301,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"volunteered, was sent to the desk for some papers, tried to raise the"
1302,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"lid, and let it drop, pretending that he couldn't, but after being"
1303,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"sharply asked what he was so careless for, did it, and then brought a"
1304,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,handkerchief and made a great ado about wanting to have something done
1305,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"with it, which proved to be tying it around his leg. Meanwhile one"
1306,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"of the horses behaved badly, whereupon the teacher said, ""I see you"

1314,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Mustang was called upon to ring the bell, a good-sized dinner-bell,"
1315,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"for the blackboard exercises by Sprite. He, too, made believe he"
1316,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"couldn't, seized it the wrong way, dropped it, picked it up wrong end"
1317,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"first, was scolded at, then took it by the handle, gave it a vigorous"
1318,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"shake, and after letting it fall several times, set it on the table."
1319,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Meanwhile a platform was brought in supporting a tall post, at the"
1320,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"top of which, higher than a horse could reach, was a blackboard having"
1321,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"chalked on it a sum which was not added up correctly. Sprite, being"
1322,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"requested to wipe it out, took the sponge from the table, and planting"
1323,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"her fore-feet on the platform, stretched her head up, and by desperate"

1326,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1327,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,One day she went through a process which showed conclusively that

1330,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"about in the saw-dust for it, the audience curiously watching to see"
1331,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,what she would do next. She was evidently much perplexed. She knew
1332,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,perfectly well that her duty would not be fulfilled until she had
1333,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"rubbed the figures out, and the sponge was not to be found. Mr."
1334,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Bartholomew said nothing, gave her no look or hint or sign to help her"
1335,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"out of her predicament, but sat in his chair and waited. At last she"
1336,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"deliberately stepped on the platform again, stretched her head up and"
1337,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"wiped the figures out with her mouth, at which the audience applauded"
1338,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,as if they would bring the roof down. That was something clearly not
1339,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"in the programme, but a bit of independent reasoning. Yet, having"
1340,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"done so much, she knew that something was not right. About that"
1341,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,sponge--what had become of it? It was her business to lay it on the
1342,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"table when she was through using it. She hesitated, looked this way"
1343,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and that, started to go, came back, dreadfully puzzled and uncertain,"
1344,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"suddenly spied it, set her teeth in it, put it on the table, and"
1345,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"went to her place, with a clear conscience, no doubt, and the people"
1346,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,cheered more wildly than before.

1349,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1350,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,This was to me one of the most interesting things I witnessed; and
1351,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"connecting it with some facts Mr. Bartholomew communicated, it was"
1352,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,doubly so.

1355,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1356,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,He said that it was his practice not to interfere or help; the horse
1357,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"knew just what she was to do, and he preferred to wait and let her"
1358,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,think it out for herself. The other horses all knew too if there was
1359,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"any failure or mistake, and the offender was closely watched by them,"
1360,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and in some way reproved by them if they could get the opportunity,"
1361,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,and at times this little by-play became very amusing.
1362,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1363,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"After this was most exquisite dancing by Bucephalus, and by Cæsar,"
1364,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,whose steppings were in perfect rhythm to the music. Then the latter
1365,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,turned in a circle to the right or the left and walked around defining
1366,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the figure eight, just as any one in the audience chose to request;"
1367,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and Abdallah came in with a string of bells around her, and paced,"
1368,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"cantered, galloped, trotted, marched or walked as the word was given."
1369,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,The horses were generally expected to come to the footlights and
1370,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,bow to the audience at the close of any feat; occasionally one would
1371,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"forget to do this, and then some of his comrades would shoulder or"
1372,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"buffet him, or Mr. Bartholomew would give a reminder, ""That is not"
1373,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"all, is it?"" and back would come the delinquent, and bow and bow"
1374,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"twenty times as fast as he could, as if there could not be enough of"
1375,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,it. At the close of one scene all the horses came up to the front in a
1376,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"line, and leaning over the rope which was stretched there to keep them"
1377,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"from coming down on the people's heads, would bow, and bow again, and"
1378,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,it was a wonderfully pretty sight to see.
1379,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1380,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"A game of leap frog was announced. ""There are four of the horses that"
1381,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"jump,"" said Mr. Bartholomew. They like this least of any of their"
1382,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"feats, and those who can do it best are most timid. At first one horse"
1383,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"is jumped over, then two, three, are packed closely together, and"
1384,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"little Sprite clears them all at one flying leap, broad-backed and"
1385,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,much taller than herself though they are. Those who do not want to
1386,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"try it beg off by a pretty pantomime, and Sprite is encouraged by her"
1387,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"master, who pats her first and seems to be saying something in her"
1388,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"ear. They like to get approval in the way of a caress, but beyond that"
1389,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,they are in no way rewarded.

1392,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1393,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Next Nellie rolled a barrel over a ""teter plank"" with her fore-feet,"
1394,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and Prince and Pope performed the difficult feat, and one which"
1395,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"required mutual understanding and confidence, of see-sawing away up"
1396,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"in air on the plank; first face to face, carefully balancing, and then"
1397,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the latter slowly turned on the space less than twenty inches wide,"
1398,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,without disturbing the delicate poise. This he considers one of the
1399,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"most remarkable, because each horse must act with reference to the"
1400,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"other, and the understanding between them must be so perfect that no"
1401,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,fatal false movement can be made.
1402,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1403,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,One of the grand tableaux represents a court scene with the donkey
1404,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"set up in a high place for judge, the jury passing around from mouth"
1405,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"to mouth a placard labelled ""Not Guilty,"" and the releasing of the"
1406,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,prisoner from his chain. But the military drill exceeds all else by
1407,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,the brilliance of the display and the inspiring movements and martial
1408,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"air. Mr. Bartholomew in military uniform advancing like a general,"
1409,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"disciplined twelve horses who came in at bugle call, with a crimson"
1410,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"band about their bodies and other decorations, and went through"
1411,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"evolutions, marchings, counter-marchings, in single file, by twos, in"
1412,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"platoons, forming a hollow square with the precision of old soldiers."
1413,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"They liked it too, and were proud of themselves as they stepped to the"
1414,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"music. The final act was a furious charge on a fort, the horses firing"
1415,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"cannon, till in smoke and flame, to the sound of patriotic strains,"
1416,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the structure was demolished, the country's flag was saved, caught up"
1417,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"by one horse, seized by another, waved, passed around, and amidst the"
1418,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"excitement and confusion of a great victory, triumphant horses rushing"

1425,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1426,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Trained horses, that is, trained for circus feats at given signals,"
1427,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"are no novelty. Away back in the reign of one of the Stuarts, a horse"
1428,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"named Morocco was exhibited in England, though his tricks were only as"
1429,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the alphabet to what is done now. And long before Rarey's day, there"
1430,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"was here and there a man who had a sort of magnetic influence, and"
1431,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,could tame a vicious horse whom nobody else dared go near. When George
1432,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the Fourth was Prince of Wales, he had a valuable Egyptian horse who"
1433,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"would throw, they said, the best rider in the world. Even if a man"
1434,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"could succeed in getting on his back, it was not an instant he could"
1435,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,stay there. But there came to England on a visit a distinguished
1436,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Eastern bey, with his mamelukes, who, hearing of the matter which"
1437,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"was the talk of the town, declared that the animal should be ridden."
1438,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,Accordingly many royal personages and noblemen met the Orientals at
1439,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"the riding house of the Prince, in Pall Mall, a mameluke's saddle was"
1440,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"put on the vicious creature, who was led in, looking in a white heat"
1441,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"of fury, wicked, with danger in his eyes, when, behold, the bey's"
1442,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,chief officer sprung on his back and rode for half an hour as easily
1443,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,as a lady would amble on the most spiritless pony that ever was

1448,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Some men have a tact, a way with animals, and can do anything with"
1449,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"them. It is a born gift, a rare one, and a precious one. There was a"
1450,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"certain tamer of lions and tigers, Henri Marten by name, who lately"
1451,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"died at the age of ninety, who tamed by his personal influence alone."
1452,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"It was said of him in France, that at the head of an army he ""might"

1454,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"menagerie."""
1455,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1456,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Professor Bartholomew was ready to talk about his way, but a part of"
1457,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,it is the man himself. He could not make known to another what is the
1458,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"most essential requisite. He, too, brought genius to his work; besides"
1459,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"that, a certain indefinable mastership which animals recognize, love"
1460,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"for them, and a vast amount of perseverance and patient waiting. It is"
1461,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,a thing that is not done in a day.
1462,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1463,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"He was fond of horses from a boy, and began early to educate one,"
1464,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"having a remarkable faculty for handling them; so that now, after"
1465,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"thirty years of it, there is not much about the equine nature that"
1466,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"he does not understand. He trained a company of Bronchos, which were"
1467,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,afterwards sold; and since then he has gradually got together the
1468,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"fifteen he now exhibits, and he has others in process of training. He"
1469,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"took these when they were young, two or three years old; and not one"
1470,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"of them, except Jim, who has a bit of outside history, has ever been"
1471,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"used in any other way. They know nothing about carriages or carts,"
1472,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"harness or saddle; they have escaped the cruel curb-bits, the check"
1473,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,reins and blinders of our civilization. Fortunate in that respect. And
1474,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"they never have had a shoe on their feet. Their feet are perfect, firm"
1475,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and sound, strong and healthy and elastic; natural, like those of the"
1476,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Indians, who run barefoot, who go over the rough places of the wilds"
1477,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,as easily as these horses can run up the stairs or over the cobble
1478,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,stones of the pavement if they were turned loose in the street.

1480,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,[Illustration: MILITARY DRILL.]
1481,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1482,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,It was a pleasure to know of their life-long exemption from all
1483,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,such restraints. That accounted in great measure for their beautiful
1484,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"freedom of motion, for that wondrous grace and charm. Did you ever"
1485,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"think what a complexity of muscles, bones, joints, tendons and other"
1486,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"arrangements, enter into the formation of the knees, hoofs, legs of a"
1487,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"horse; what a piece of mechanism the strong, supple creature is?"
1488,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1489,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,These have never had their spirits broken; have never been scolded at
1490,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,or struck except when a whip was necessary as a rod sometimes is for
1491,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,a child. The hostlers who take care of them are not allowed to speak
1492,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"roughly. ""Be low-spoken to them,"" the master says. In the years when"
1493,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"he was educating them he groomed and cared for them himself, with no"
1494,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,other help except that of his two little sons. No one else was allowed
1495,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"to meddle with them; and, necessarily, they were kept separate from"
1496,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"other horses. Now, wherever they are exhibiting, he always goes out"
1497,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,the first thing in the morning to see them. He passes from one to
1498,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"another, and they are all expecting the little love pats and slaps"
1499,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"on their glossy sides, the caressings and fondlings and pleasant"
1500,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"greetings of ""Chevalier, how are you, old fellow?"" ""Abdallah,"
1501,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"my beauty,"" and, ""Nellie, my pet!"" Some are jealous, Abdallah"
1502,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"tremendously so, and if he does not at once notice her, she lays her"
1503,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"ears back, shows temper, and crowds up to him, determined that no"
1504,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,other shall have precedence.

1508,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"They are not ""thorough-breds."" Those, he said, were for racers or"
1509,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"travellers; yet of fine breeds, some choice blood horses, some mixed,"
1510,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"one a mustang, who at first did not know anything that was wanted of"
1511,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,him.
1512,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1513,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"""Why,"" said he, ""at first some of them would go up like pop corn,"
1514,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,higher than my head. But I never once have been injured by one of them
1515,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,except perhaps an accidental stepping on my foot. They never kick;
1516,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"they don't know how to kick. You can go behind them as well as before,"
1517,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"and anywhere."""
1518,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1519,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,In buying he chose only those whose looks showed that they were
1520,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"intelligent. ""But how did he know, by what signs?"" queried an"
1521,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"all-absorbed ""Dumb Animals"" woman."
1522,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1523,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"""Oh, dear,"" he said, ""why, every way; the eyes, the ears, the whole"
1524,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"face, the expression, everything. No two horses' faces look alike."
1525,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Just as it is with a flock of sheep. A stranger would say, 'Why, they"
1526,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"are all sheep, and all alike, and that is all there is to it;' but the"
1527,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"owner knows better; he knows every face in the flock. He says, 'this"
1528,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"is Jenny, and that is Dolly, there is Jim, and here's Nancy.' Oh,"
1529,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"land, yes! they are no more alike than human beings are, disposition"
1530,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"or anything. Some have to be ordered, and some coaxed and flattered."
1531,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Yes, flattered. Now if two men come and want to work for me, I can"
1532,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"tell as soon as I cast my eyes on them. I say to one, 'Go and do such"
1533,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"a thing;' but if I said it to the other, he'd answer 'I won't; I'm not"
1534,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,going to be ordered about by any man.' Horses are just like that. A
1535,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"horse can read you. If you get mad, he will. If you abuse him, he will"
1536,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"do the same by you, or try to. You must control yourself, if you would"
1537,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"control a horse."""
1538,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1539,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"They must be of superior grade, ""for it's of no use to spend one's"
1540,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,time on a dull one. It does not pay to teach idiots where you want
1541,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"brilliant results, though all well enough for a certain purpose."""
1542,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1543,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,Some of these he had been five years in educating to do what we saw.
1544,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Some he had taught to do their special part in one year, some in two."
1545,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,The first thing he did was to give the horse opportunity and time to
1546,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"get well acquainted with him; in his words, ""to become friends. Let"
1547,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"him see that you are his friend, that you are not going to whip him."
1548,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"You meet him cordially. You are glad to see him and be with him, and"
1549,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,pretty soon he knows it and likes to be with you. And so you establish
1550,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"comradeship, you understand each other. Caress him softly. Don't make"
1551,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,a dash at him. Say pleasant things to him. Be gentle; but at the same
1552,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"time you must be _master_."" That is a good basis. And then he teaches"
1553,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"one thing at a time, a simple thing, and waits a good while before"
1554,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,he brings forward another; does not perplex or puzzle the pupil by
1555,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"anything else till that is learned, and some of the first words are"
1556,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"""come,"" ""stand,"" ""remain."""
1557,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1558,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,What a horse has once learned he never or seldom forgets. Mr.
1559,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Bartholomew thinks it is not as has sometimes been said, because a"
1560,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"horse has a memory stronger than a man, ""but because he has fewer"
1561,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,things to learn. A man sees a million things. A horse's mind cannot
1562,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"accommodate what a man's can, so those things he knows have a better"
1563,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,chance. Those few things he fixes. His memory fastens on them. I once
1564,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"had a pony I had trained, which was afterwards gone from me three"
1565,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"years. At the end of that time I was in California exhibiting, and saw"
1566,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"a boy on the pony. I tried to buy him, but the boy who had owned him"
1567,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"all that time, refused to part with him; however, I offered such a"
1568,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"price that I got him, and that same evening I took him into the tent"
1569,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,and thought I would see what he remembered. He went through all his
1570,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,old tricks (besides a few I had myself forgotten) except one. He could
1571,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,not manage walking on his hind feet the distance he used to. Another
1572,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"time I had a trained horse stolen from me by the Indians, and he was"
1573,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"off in the wilds with them a year and a half. One day, in a little"
1574,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"village--that was in California too--I saw him and knew him, and the"
1575,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"horse knew me. I went up to the Indian who had him and said, 'That is"
1576,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"my horse, and I can prove it.' Out there a stolen horse, no matter how"
1577,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"many times he has changed hands, is given up, if the owner can prove"
1578,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"it. The Indian said, 'If you can, you shall have him, but you won't"
1579,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"do it.' I said, 'I will try him in four things; I will ask him to trot"
1580,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"three times around a circle, to lie down, to sit up, and to bring me"
1581,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"my handkerchief. If he is my horse, he will do it.' The Indian said,"
1582,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"'You shall have him if he does, but he won't!' By this time a crowd"
1583,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"had got together. We put the horse in an enclosure, he did as he was"
1584,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"told, and I had him back."""
1585,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1586,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Mr. Bartholomew said, ""My motto in educating them is, 'Make haste"
1587,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"slowly;' I never require too much, and I never ask a horse to do what"
1588,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,he _can't_ do. That is of no use. A horse _can't_ learn what horses
1589,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,are not capable of learning; and he can't do a thing until he
1590,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"understands what you mean, and how you want it done. What good would"
1591,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,it do for me to ask a man a question in French if he did not know a
1592,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"word of the language? I get him used to the word, and show him what"
1593,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"I want. If it is to climb up somewhere, I gently put his foot up and"
1594,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"have him keep it there until I am ready to have it come down, and"
1595,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,then I take it down myself. I never let the horse do it. The same with
1596,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"other things, showing him how, and by words. They know a great number"
1597,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,of words. My horses are not influenced by signs or motions when they
1598,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"are on the stage. They use their intelligence and memory, and they"
1599,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,associate ideas and are required to obey. They learn a great deal by
1600,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,observing one another. One watches and learns by seeing the others.
1601,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"I taught one horse to kneel, by first bending his knee myself, and"
1602,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"putting him into position. After he had learned, I took another in"
1603,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"who kept watch all the time, and learned partly by imitation. They are"
1604,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"social creatures; they love each other's company."""
1605,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,
1606,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Most of these horses have been together now for several years, and"
1607,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,are fond of one another. They appear to keep the run of the whole
1608,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"performance, and listen and notice like children in a school when"
1609,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,one or more of their number goes out to recite. It was extremely
1610,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,interesting to observe them when the leap-frog game was going on.
1611,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"Owing to the smallness of the stage, it was difficult for the horse"
1612,SOME EDUCATED HORSES.,"who was to make the jump to get under headway, and several times"

1973,THE WOLF AND THE GOSLINGS.,"The wolf had eaten so greedily,"

1978,THE WOLF AND THE GOSLINGS.,"Then the gray goose got six heavy stones,"

2229,OSITO.,On the lofty mountain that faced the captain's cabin the frost had
2230,OSITO.,"already made an insidious approach, and the slender thickets of"
2231,OSITO.,"quaking ash that marked the course of each tiny torrent, now stood"
2232,OSITO.,out in resplendent hues and shone afar off like gay ribbons running
2233,OSITO.,"through the dark-green pines. Gorgeously, too, with scarlet, crimson"
2234,OSITO.,"and gold, gleamed the lower spurs, where the oak-brush grew in dense"
2235,OSITO.,"masses and bore beneath a blaze of color, a goodly harvest of acorns,"
2236,OSITO.,now ripe and loosened in their cups.
2237,OSITO.,
2238,OSITO.,"It was where one of these spurs joined the parent mountain, where the"
2239,OSITO.,"oak-brush grew thickest, and, as a consequence, the acorns were most"
2240,OSITO.,"abundant, that the captain, well versed in wood-craft mysteries,"
2241,OSITO.,had built his bear trap. For two days he had been engaged upon
2242,OSITO.,"it, and now, as the evening drew on, he sat contemplating it with"
2243,OSITO.,"satisfaction, as a work finished and perfected."
2244,OSITO.,
2245,OSITO.,"From his station there, on the breast of the lofty mountain, the"
2246,OSITO.,captain could scan many an acre of sombre pine forest with pleasant
2247,OSITO.,"little parks interspersed, and here and there long slopes brown with"
2248,OSITO.,bunch grass. He was the lord of this wild domain. And yet his sway
2249,OSITO.,there was not undisputed. Behind an intervening spur to the westward
2250,OSITO.,ran an old Indian trail long traveled by the Southern Utes in their
2251,OSITO.,"migrations north for trading and hunting purposes. And even now, a"
2252,OSITO.,"light smoke wafted upward on the evening air, told of a band encamped"
2253,OSITO.,on the trail on their homeward journey to the Southwest.
2254,OSITO.,
2255,OSITO.,The captain needed not this visual token of their proximity. He
2256,OSITO.,had been aware of it for several days. Their calls at his cabin in
2257,OSITO.,"the lonely little park below had been frequent, and they had been"
2258,OSITO.,"specially solicitous of his coffee, his sugar, his biscuit and other"
2259,OSITO.,"delicacies, insomuch that once or twice during his absence these"
2260,OSITO.,"ingenuous children of Nature had with primitive simplicity, entered"
2261,OSITO.,his cabin and helped themselves without leave or stint.
2262,OSITO.,
2263,OSITO.,"However, as he knew their stay would be short, the captain bore"
2264,OSITO.,these neighborly attentions with mild forbearance. It was guests more
2265,OSITO.,graceless than these who had roused his wrath.
2266,OSITO.,
2267,OSITO.,From their secret haunts far back towards the Snowy Range the bears
2268,OSITO.,"had come down to feast upon the ripened acorns, and so doing, had"
2269,OSITO.,scented the captain's bacon and sugar afar off and had prowled by
2270,OSITO.,"night about the cabin. Nay, more, three days before, the captain,"
2271,OSITO.,"having gone hurriedly away and left the door loosely fastened, upon"
2272,OSITO.,his return had found all in confusion. Many of his eatables had
2273,OSITO.,"vanished, his flour sack was ripped open, and, unkindest cut of all,"
2274,OSITO.,his beloved books lay scattered about. At the first indignant glance
2275,OSITO.,"the captain had cried out, ""Utes again!"" But on looking around he saw"
2276,OSITO.,a tell-tale trail left by floury bear paws.
2277,OSITO.,
2278,OSITO.,Hence this bear trap.
2279,OSITO.,
2280,OSITO.,It was but a strong log pen floored with rough-hewn slabs and fitted
2281,OSITO.,with a ponderous movable lid made of other slabs pinned on stout cross
2282,OSITO.,"pieces. But, satisfied with his handiwork, the captain now arose, and,"
2283,OSITO.,"prying up one end of the lid with a lever, set the trigger and baited"
2284,OSITO.,it with a huge piece of bacon. He then piled a great quantity of rock
2285,OSITO.,upon the already heavy lid to further guard against the escape of any
2286,OSITO.,"bear so unfortunate as to enter, and shouldering his axe and rifle"
2287,OSITO.,walked homewards.
2288,OSITO.,
2289,OSITO.,"Whatever vengeful visions of captive bears he was indulging in were,"
2290,OSITO.,"however, wholly dispelled as he drew near the cabin. Before the"
2291,OSITO.,"door stood the Ute chief accompanied by two squaws. ""How!"" said the"
2292,OSITO.,"chieftain, with a conciliatory smile, laying one hand on his breast of"
2293,OSITO.,bronze and extending the other as the captain approached.
2294,OSITO.,
2295,OSITO.,"""How!"" returned the captain bluffly, disdaining the hand with a"
2296,OSITO.,recollection of sundry petty thefts.
2297,OSITO.,
2298,OSITO.,"""Has the great captain seen a pappoose about his wigwam?"" asked"
2299,OSITO.,"the chief, nowise abashed, in Spanish--a language which many of the"
2300,OSITO.,Southern Utes speak as fluently as their own.
2301,OSITO.,
2302,OSITO.,"The great captain had expected a request for a biscuit; he, therefore,"
2303,OSITO.,was naturally surprised at being asked for a baby. With an effort he
2304,OSITO.,mustered together his Spanish phrases and managed to reply that he had
2305,OSITO.,seen no pappoose.
2306,OSITO.,
2307,OSITO.,"""Me pappoose lost,"" said one of the squaws brokenly. And there was so"
2308,OSITO.,"much distress in her voice that the captain, forgetting instantly all"
2309,OSITO.,"about the slight depredations of his dusky neighbors, volunteered to"
2310,OSITO.,aid them in their search for the missing child.
2311,OSITO.,
2312,OSITO.,"All that night, for it was by this time nearly dark, the hills flared"
2313,OSITO.,"with pine torches and resounded with the shrill cries of the squaws,"
2314,OSITO.,"the whoops of the warriors, the shouts of the captain; but the search"
2315,OSITO.,was fruitless.
2316,OSITO.,
2317,OSITO.,"This adventure drove the bear-trap from its builder's mind, and it"
2318,OSITO.,was two days before it occurred to him to go there in quest of captive
2319,OSITO.,bears.
2320,OSITO.,
2321,OSITO.,Coming in view of it he immediately saw the lid was down. Hastily he
2322,OSITO.,"approached, bent over, and peeped in. And certainly, in the whole of"
2323,OSITO.,his adventurous life the captain was never more taken by surprise; for
2324,OSITO.,"there, crouched in one corner, was that precious Indian infant."
2325,OSITO.,
2326,OSITO.,"Yes, true it was, that all those massive timbers, all that ponderous"
2327,OSITO.,"mass of rock, had only availed to capture one very small Ute pappoose."
2328,OSITO.,"At the thought of it, the builder of the trap was astounded. He"
2329,OSITO.,laughed aloud at the absurdity. In silence he threw off the rock
2330,OSITO.,and lid and seated himself on the edge of the open trap. Captor and
2331,OSITO.,captive then gazed at each other with gravity. The errant infant's
2332,OSITO.,"attire consisted of a calico shirt of gaudy hues, a pair of little"
2333,OSITO.,"moccasins, much frayed, and a red flannel string. This last was tied"
2334,OSITO.,"about his straggling hair, which fell over his forehead like the"
2335,OSITO.,"shaggy mane of a _bronco_ colt and veiled, but could not obscure, the"
2336,OSITO.,brightness of his black eyes.
2337,OSITO.,
2338,OSITO.,"He did not cry; in fact, this small stoic never even whimpered, but he"
2339,OSITO.,"held the bacon, or what remained of it, clasped tightly to his breast"
2340,OSITO.,"and gazed at his captor in silence. Glancing at the bacon, the captain"
2341,OSITO.,"saw it all. Hunger had induced this wee wanderer to enter the trap,"
2342,OSITO.,"and in detaching the bait, he had sprung the trigger and was caught."
2343,OSITO.,
2344,OSITO.,"""What are you called, little one?"" asked the captain at length, in a"
2345,OSITO.,"reassuring voice, speaking Spanish very slowly and distinctly."
2346,OSITO.,
2347,OSITO.,"""Osito,"" replied the wanderer in a small piping voice, but with the"
2348,OSITO.,dignity of a warrior.
2349,OSITO.,
2350,OSITO.,"""Little Bear!"" the captain repeated, and burst into a hearty laugh,"
2351,OSITO.,"immediately checked, however by the thought that now he had caught"
2352,OSITO.,"him, what was he to do with him? The first thing, evidently, was to"
2353,OSITO.,feed him.
2354,OSITO.,
2355,OSITO.,"So he conducted him to the cabin and there, observing the celerity"
2356,OSITO.,"with which the lumps of sugar vanished, he saw at once that Little"
2357,OSITO.,"Bear was most aptly named. Then, sometimes leading, and sometimes"
2358,OSITO.,"carrying him, for Osito was very small, he set out for the Ute"
2359,OSITO.,encampment.
2360,OSITO.,
2361,OSITO.,"Their approach was the signal for a mighty shout. Warriors, squaws and"
2362,OSITO.,"the younger confrères of Osito, crowded about him. A few words from"
2363,OSITO.,"the captain explained all, and Osito himself, clinging to his mother,"
2364,OSITO.,"was borne away in triumph--the hero of the hour. Yet, no--the captain"
2365,OSITO.,"was that, I believe. For as he stood in their midst with a very"
2366,OSITO.,"pleased look on his sunburnt face, the chief quieting the hubbub with"
2367,OSITO.,"a wave of his hand, advanced and stood before him. ""The great captain"
2368,OSITO.,"has a good heart,"" he said in tones of conviction. ""What can his Ute"
2369,OSITO.,"friends do to show their gratitude?"""
2370,OSITO.,
2371,OSITO.,"""Nothing,"" said the captain, looking more pleased than ever."
2372,OSITO.,
2373,OSITO.,"""The captain has been troubled by the bears. Would it please him if"
2374,OSITO.,they were all driven back to their dens in the great mountains towards
2375,OSITO.,"the setting sun?"""
2376,OSITO.,
2377,OSITO.,"""It would,"" said the captain; ""can it be done?"""
2378,OSITO.,
2379,OSITO.,"""It can. It shall,"" said the chief with emphasis. ""To-morrow let the"
2380,OSITO.,"_captain_ keep his eyes open, and as the sun sinks behind the mountain"
2381,OSITO.,"tops he shall see the bears follow also."""
2382,OSITO.,
2383,OSITO.,The chief kept his word. The next day the uproar on the hills was
2384,OSITO.,"terrific. Frightened out of their wits, the bears forsook the acorn"
2385,OSITO.,field and fled ingloriously to their secret haunts in the mountains to
2386,OSITO.,the westward.
2387,OSITO.,
2388,OSITO.,"[Illustration: ""WHAT ARE YOU CALLED, LITTLE ONE?"" ASKED THE CAPTAIN.]"
2389,OSITO.,
2390,OSITO.,In joy thereof the captain gave a great farewell feast to his red
2391,OSITO.,"allies. It was spread under the pines in front of his cabin, and every"
2392,OSITO.,"delicacy of the season was there, from bear steaks to beaver tails."
2393,OSITO.,"The banquet was drawing to a close, and complimentary speeches 'twixt"
2394,OSITO.,"host and guests were in order, when a procession of the squaws was"
2395,OSITO.,seen approaching from the encampment. They drew near and headed for
2396,OSITO.,"the captain in solemn silence. As they passed, each laid some gift"
2397,OSITO.,"at his feet--fringed leggings; beaded moccasins, bear skins, coyote"
2398,OSITO.,"skins, beaver pelts and soft robes of the mountain lion's hide--until"
2399,OSITO.,the pile reached to the captain's shoulders. Last of all came Osito's
2400,OSITO.,mother and crowned the heap with a beautiful little brown bear skin.
2401,OSITO.,"It was fancifully adorned with blue ribbons, and in the center of the"
2402,OSITO.,"tanned side there were drawn, in red pigment, the outlines of a very"
2403,OSITO.,stolid and stoical-looking pappoose.

2630,(_A TRUE STORY._),"Marland's snake was already coiled, and it was hardly more than a foot"

3034,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"brick houses, were crowded with people--artisans, slaves, soldiers,"
3035,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"nobles and citizens, the latter clad in white linen shirts, gay"
3036,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"woollen tunics and short cloaks. Two-wheeled wooden vehicles, drawn by"
3037,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"horses decked with bells and tassels, litters containing veiled women"
3038,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"borne by slaves, and now and then, the superb gilded carriage, hung"
3039,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"with silk curtains, of some royal princess passed along. Here and"
3040,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"there a heavily laden camel moved slowly by, and the next instant a"
3041,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,soldier of the king's bodyguard dashed past in his superb uniform--a
3042,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"gold cuirass, purple surcoat, and high Persian cap, the gold scabbard"
3043,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,of his sword and the gold apple on his lance-tip flashing in the sun.

3045,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,[Illustration: THE HUNTING PARTY WERE NEARLY READY TO START.]
3046,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3047,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,High above the topmost roofs of even the lofty towers on the walls
3048,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"rose the great sanctuary of the Magi,[1] the immense Temple of Bel,"
3049,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"visible in all quarters of the city, and seen for miles from every"
3050,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,part of the flat plain on which Babylon stood. The huge staircase
3051,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,wound like a serpent round and round the outside of the building to
3052,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"the highest story, which contained the sanctuary itself and also the"
3053,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,observatory whence the priests studied the stars.
3054,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3055,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,[Footnote 1: The Magi were the Persian priests.]
3056,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3057,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Otanes and Smerdis, chatting eagerly together, rode on as fast as"
3058,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"the crowd would permit, and soon reached one of the gates in the huge"
3059,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"walls that defended the city. These walls, seventy-five feet high, and"
3060,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"wide enough to allow two chariots to drive abreast, were strengthened"
3061,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"by two hundred and fifty towers, except on one side, where deep"
3062,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,marshes extended to their base. Beyond these marshes lay the
3063,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"hunting-grounds, and the party, turning to the left, rode for a time"
3064,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"over a smooth highway, between broad tracts of land sown with wheat,"
3065,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,barley and sesame. Slender palm-trees covered with clusters of golden
3066,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"dates were seen in every direction, and the sunbeams shimmered on the"
3067,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,canals and ditches which conducted water from the Euphrates to all
3068,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,parts of the fields.
3069,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3070,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Otanes' horse suddenly shied violently as a rider, mounted on a fleet"
3071,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"steed, and carrying a large pouch, dashed by like the wind."
3072,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3073,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""One of the Augari bearing letters to the next station!"" exclaimed"
3074,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Smerdis. ""See how he skims along. Hi! If I were not to be one of the"
3075,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"king's bodyguard, I'd try for an Augar's place. How he goes! He's"
3076,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"almost out of sight already."""
3077,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3078,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""How far apart are the stations?"" asked Otanes."
3079,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3080,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""Eighteen miles. And when he gets there, he'll just toss the letter"
3081,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"bag to the next man, who is sitting on a fresh horse waiting for it,"
3082,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,and away _he'll_ go like lightning. That's the way the news is carried
3083,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"to the very end of the empire of our lord the King."""
3084,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3085,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""Must be fine fun,"" replied Otanes. ""But see, there's the gate of the"
3086,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"hunting-park. Now for the lion,"" he added gayly."
3087,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3088,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""May Ormuzd[2] save you from meeting one, my young master,"" said the"
3089,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"old servant, Candaules. ""Luckily it's broad daylight, and they are"
3090,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,more apt to come from their lairs after dark. Better begin with
3091,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"smaller game and leave the lion and wild boars to your father."""
3092,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3093,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,[Footnote 2: The principal god of the Persians.]
3094,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3095,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""Not if we catch sight of them,"" cried Otanes, settling his shield"
3096,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"more firmly on his arm, and urging his horse to a quicker pace, for"
3097,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,the head of the long train of attendants had already disappeared amid
3098,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,the dark cypress-trees of the hunting park. The immense enclosure
3099,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,stretching from the edge of the morasses that bordered the walls
3100,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"of Babylon far into the country, soon echoed with the shouts of the"
3101,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"attendants beating the coverts for game, the baying of the dogs, the"
3102,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"hiss of lances and whir of arrows. Bright-hued birds, roused by"
3103,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"the tumult, flew wildly hither and thither, now and then the superb"
3104,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,plumage of a bird of paradise flashing like a jewel among the dense
3105,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,foliage of cypress and nut-trees.
3106,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3107,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,Hour after hour sped swiftly away; the party had dispersed in
3108,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"different directions, following the course of the game; the sun was"
3109,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"sinking low, and the slaves were bringing the slaughtered birds and"
3110,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,beasts to the wagons used to convey them home. A magnificent stag was
3111,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"among the spoil, and a fierce wild boar, after a long struggle, had"
3112,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,fallen under a thrust from Intaphernes's lance.
3113,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3114,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"The shrill blast of the Median trumpet sounded thrice, to give the"
3115,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,first of the three signals for the scattered hunters to meet at the
3116,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"appointed place, near the entrance of the park, and the two young"
3117,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"brothers who, attended by Candaules and half a dozen slaves, had"
3118,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"ridden far into the shady recesses of the woods, reluctantly turned"
3119,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,their horses' heads. No thought of disobeying the summons entered
3120,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,their minds--Persian boys were taught that next to truth and
3121,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"courage, obedience was the highest virtue, and rarely was a command"
3122,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,transgressed.
3123,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3124,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"They had had a good day's sport; few arrows remained in their quivers,"
3125,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,and the attendants carried bunches of gay plumaged birds and several
3126,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"small animals, among them a pretty little fawn. ""Let's go nearer the"
3127,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"marshes; there are not so many trees, and we can ride faster,"" said"
3128,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Otanes as the trumpet-call was repeated, and the little party turned"
3129,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"in that direction, moving more swiftly as they passed out upon the"
3130,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,strip of open ground between the thicket and the marshes. The sun was
3131,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"just setting. The last crimson rays, shimmering on the pools of water"
3132,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"standing here and there in the morasses, cast reflections on the tall"
3133,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,reeds and rushes bordering their margins.
3134,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3135,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Suddenly a pretty spotted fawn darted in front of the group, and"
3136,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"crossing the open ground, vanished amid a thick clump of reeds. ""What"
3137,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"a nice pet the little creature would make for our sister Hadassah!"""
3138,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"cried Otanes eagerly. ""See! it has hidden among the reeds; we might"
3139,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"take it alive. Go with Candaules and the slaves, Smerdis, and form"
3140,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"a half-circle beyond the clump. When you're ready, whistle, and I'll"
3141,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,ride straight down and drive it towards you; you can easily catch it
3142,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,then. We are so near the entrance of the park now that we shall have
3143,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"plenty of time; the third signal hasn't sounded yet."""
3144,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3145,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,Smerdis instantly agreed to the plan. The horses were fastened to some
3146,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"trees, and the men cautiously made a wide circuit, passed the bed of"
3147,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"reeds, and concealed themselves, behind the tall rushes beyond. A low"
3148,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,whistle gave Otanes the signal to drive out the fawn.
3149,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3150,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Smerdis and the slaves saw the lad straighten himself in the saddle,"
3151,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"and with a shout, dash at full speed towards the spot where the fawn"
3152,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,had vanished. He had almost reached it when the stiff stalks shook
3153,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"violently, and a loud roar made them all spring to their feet. They"
3154,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"saw the brave boy check his horse and fit an arrow to the string, but"
3155,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"as he drew the bow, there was a stronger rustle among the reeds; a"
3156,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"tawny object flashed through the air, striking Otanes from his saddle,"
3157,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"while the horse free from its rider, dashed, snorting with terror,"
3158,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,towards the park entrance.
3159,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3160,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""A lion! A lion!"" shrieked the trembling slaves, but Smerdis, drawing"
3161,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"his dagger, ran towards the place where his brother had fallen,"
3162,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,passing close by the body of the fawn which lay among the reeds with
3163,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,its head crushed by a blow from the lion's paw. Candaules followed
3164,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,close at the lad's heels.
3165,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3166,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Parting the thick growth of stalks, they saw, only a few paces off,"
3167,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Otanes, covered with blood, lying motionless on the ground, and beside"
3168,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"him the dead body of a half-grown lion, the boy's arrow buried in"
3169,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"one eye, while the blood still streamed from the lance-wound in the"
3170,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,animal's side.
3171,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3172,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Smerdis, weeping, threw himself beside his brother, and at the same"
3173,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"moment Intaphernes, with several nobles and attendants, attracted"
3174,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"by the cries, dashed up to the spot. The father, springing from the"
3175,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"saddle, bent, and laid his hand on the boy's heart."
3176,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3177,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""It is beating still, and strongly too,"" he exclaimed. ""Throw water in"
3178,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"his face! perhaps--"""
3179,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3180,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"Without finishing the sentence, he carefully examined the motionless"
3181,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"form. ""Ormuzd be praised! He has no wound; the blood has flowed from"
3182,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"the lion. See, Prexaspes, there is a lance-head sticking in its side."
3183,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"I believe it's the very beast you wounded early in the day."""
3184,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3185,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"The officer whose laugh had so vexed Otanes, stooped over the dead"
3186,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,lion and looked at the broken shaft.
3187,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3188,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""Ay, it's my weapon; the beast probably made its way to the morass for"
3189,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"water; but, by Mithras![3] the lad's arrow killed the brute; the barb"
3190,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"passed through the eyeball into the brain."""
3191,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3192,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,[Footnote 3: The Persian god of the sun.]
3193,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3194,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"""Yes, my lord,"" cried old Candaules eagerly, ""and doubtless it was"
3195,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"only the weight of the animal, which, striking my young master as it"
3196,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"made its spring, hurled him from the saddle and stunned him. See! he"
3197,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"is opening his eyes. Otanes, Otanes, you've killed the lion!"""
3198,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,
3199,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"The boy's eyelids fluttered, then slowly rose, his eyes wandered over"
3200,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"the group, and at last rested on the dead lion. The old slave's words"
3201,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"had evidently reached his ear, for with a faint smile he glanced"
3202,TWO PERSIAN SCHOOLBOYS.,"archly at Prexaspes, and raising himself on one elbow, said:"

3358,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and Little Stumps clung to her dress with his little pinched brown
3359,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"hand wherever she went, while Jim whooped it over the hills and chased"
3360,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"jack-rabbits as if he were a greyhound. He would climb trees, too,"
3361,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"like a squirrel. And, oh!--it was deplorable--but how he could swear!"
3362,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3363,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"At length some of the miners, seeing the boy must come to some bad"
3364,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"end if not taken care of, put their heads and their pockets together"
3365,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and sent the children to school. This school was a mile away over
3366,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"the beautiful brown hills, a long, pleasant walk under the green"
3367,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,California oaks.
3368,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3369,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Well, Jim would take the little tin dinner bucket, and his slate, and"
3370,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,all their books under his arm and go booming ahead about half a mile
3371,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"in advance, while Madge with brown Little Stumps clinging to her side"
3372,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"like a burr, would come stepping along the trail under the oak-trees"
3373,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,as fast as she could after him.
3374,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3375,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"But if a jack-rabbit, or a deer, or a fox crossed Jim's path, no"
3376,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"matter how late it was, or how the teacher had threatened him, he"
3377,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"would drop books, lunch, slate and all, and spitting on his hands and"
3378,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"rolling up his sleeves, would bound away after it, yelling like a"
3379,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"wild Indian. And some days, so fascinating was the chase, Jim did"
3380,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,not appear at the schoolhouse at all; and of course Madge and Stumps
3381,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,played truant too. Sometimes a week together would pass and the
3382,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Keene children would not be seen at the schoolhouse. Visits from the
3383,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,schoolmaster produced no lasting effect. The children would come for a
3384,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"day or two, then be seen no more. The schoolmaster and their father at"
3385,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,last had a serious talk about the matter.
3386,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3387,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""What _can_ I do with him?"" said Mr. Keene."
3388,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3389,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""You'll have to put him to work,"" said the schoolmaster. ""Set him to"
3390,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,hunting nuggets instead of bird's-nests. I guess what the boy wants is
3391,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"some honest means of using his strength. He's a good boy, Mr. Keene;"
3392,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,don't despair of him. Jim would be proud to be an 'honest miner.'
3393,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Jim's a good boy, Mr. Keene."""
3394,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3395,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Well, then, thank you, Schoolmaster,"" said Mr. Keene. ""Jim's a good"
3396,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"boy; and Madge is good, Mr. Schoolmaster; and poor starved and stunted"
3397,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"motherless Little Stumps, he is good as gold, Mr. Schoolmaster. And I"
3398,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"want to be a mother to 'em--I want to be father and mother to 'em all,"
3399,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Mr. Schoolmaster. And I'll follow your advice. I'll put 'em all to
3400,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"work a-huntin' for gold."""
3401,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3402,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"The next day away up on the hillside under a pleasant oak, where"
3403,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"the air was sweet and cool, and the ground soft and dotted over with"
3404,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"flowers, the tender-hearted old man that wanted to be ""father and"
3405,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"mother both,"" ""located"" a claim. The flowers were kept fresh by a"
3406,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,little stream of waste water from the ditch that girded the brow of
3407,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,the hill above. Here he set a sluice-box and put his three little
3408,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"miners at work with pick, pan and shovel. There he left them and"
3409,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,limped back to his own place in the mine below.
3410,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3411,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,And how they did work! And how pleasant it was here under the broad
3412,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"boughs of the oak, with the water rippling through the sluice on the"
3413,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"soft, loose soil which they shoveled into the long sluice-box. They"
3414,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"could see the mule-trains going and coming, and the clouds of dust far"
3415,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,below which told them the stage was whirling up the valley. But Jim
3416,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,kept steadily on at his work day after day. Even though jack-rabbits
3417,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"and squirrels appeared on the very scene, he would not leave till,"
3418,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"like the rest of the honest miners, he could shoulder his pick and pan"
3419,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and go down home with the setting sun.
3420,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3421,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Sometimes the men who had tried to keep the children at school, would"
3422,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"come that way, and with a sly smile, talk very wisely about whether"
3423,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"or not the new miners would ""strike it"" under the cool oak among the"
3424,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,flowers on the hill. But Jim never stopped to talk much. He dug and
3425,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"wrestled away, day after day, now up to his waist in the pit."
3426,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3427,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,One Saturday evening the old man limped up the hillside to help the
3428,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"young miners ""clean up."""
3429,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3430,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"[Illustration: ""COLOR! TWO COLORS! THREE, FOUR, FIVE--A DOZEN!""]"
3431,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3432,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,He sat down at the head of the sluice-box and gave directions how they
3433,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"should turn off the most of the water, wash down the ""toilings"" very"
3434,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"low, lift up the ""riffle,"" brush down the ""apron,"" and finally set the"
3435,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"pan in the lower end of the ""sluice-toil"" and pour in the quicksilver"
3436,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,to gather up and hold the gold.
3437,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3438,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""What for you put your hand in de water for, papa?"" queried Little"
3439,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Stumps, who had left off his work, which consisted mainly of pulling"
3440,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,flowers and putting them in the sluice-box to see them float away. He
3441,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"was sitting by his father's side, and he looked up in his face as he"
3442,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,spoke.
3443,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3444,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Hush, child,"" said the old man softly, as he again dipped his thumb"
3445,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and finger in his vest pocket as if about to take snuff. But he did
3446,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,not take snuff. Again his hand was reached down to the rippling water
3447,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,at the head of the sluice-box. And this time curious but obedient
3448,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Little Stumps was silent.
3449,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3450,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Suddenly there was a shout, such a shout from Jim as the hills had not"
3451,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,heard since he was a schoolboy.
3452,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3453,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"He had found the ""color."" ""Two colors! three, four, five--a dozen!"""
3454,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"The boy shouted like a Modoc, threw down the brush and scraper, and"
3455,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"kissed his little sister over and over, and cried as he did so; then"
3456,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"he whispered softly to her as he again took up his brush and scraper,"
3457,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"that it was ""for papa; all for poor papa; that he did not care for"
3458,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"himself, but he did want to help poor, tired, and crippled papa."" But"
3459,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,papa did not seem to be excited so very much.
3460,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3461,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,The little miners were now continually wild with excitement. They
3462,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,were up and at work Monday morning at dawn. The men who were in the
3463,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"father's tender secret, congratulated the children heartily and made"
3464,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,them presents of several small nuggets to add to their little hoard.
3465,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3466,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,In this way they kept steadily at work for half the summer. All the
3467,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"gold was given to papa to keep. Papa weighed it each week, and I"
3468,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,suppose secretly congratulated himself that he was getting back about
3469,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,as much as he put in.
3470,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3471,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Before quite the end of the third month, Jim struck a thin bed of blue"
3472,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,gravel. The miners who had been happily chuckling and laughing among
3473,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"themselves to think how they had managed to keep Jim out of mischief,"
3474,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,began to look at each other and wonder how in the world blue gravel
3475,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,ever got up there on the hill. And in a few days more there was a
3476,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"well-defined bed of blue gravel, too; and not one of the miners could"
3477,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,make it out.
3478,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3479,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"One Saturday evening shortly after, as the old man weighed their gold"
3480,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"he caught his breath, started, and stood up straight; straighter than"
3481,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,he had stood since he crossed the Plains. Then he hastily left the
3482,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,cabin. He went up the hill to the children's claim almost without
3483,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"limping. Then he took a pencil and an old piece of a letter, and wrote"
3484,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"out a notice and tacked it up on the big oak-tree, claiming those"
3485,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"mining claims according to miners' law, for the three children. A"
3486,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"couple of miners laughed as they went by in the twilight, to see what"
3487,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,he was doing; and he laughed with them. But as he limped on down the
3488,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,hill he smiled.
3489,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3490,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"That night as they sat at supper, he told the children that as they"
3491,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"had been such faithful and industrious miners, he was going to give"
3492,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"them each a present, besides a little gold to spend as they pleased."
3493,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3494,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"So he went up to the store and bought Jim a red shirt, long black and"
3495,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"bright gum boots, a broad-brimmed hat, and a belt. He also bought each"
3496,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"of the other children some pretty trappings, and gave each a dollar's"
3497,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"worth of gold dust. Madge and Stumps handed their gold back to ""poor"
3498,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"papa."" But Jim was crazy with excitement. He put on his new clothes"
3499,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and went forth to spend his dollar. And what do you suppose he bought?
3500,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,I hesitate to tell you. But what he bought was a pipe and a paper of
3501,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,tobacco!
3502,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3503,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"That red shirt, that belt and broad-brimmed hat, together with the"
3504,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"shiny top boots, had been too much for Jim's balance. How could a"
3505,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"man--he spoke of himself as a man now--how could a man be an ""honest"
3506,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"miner"" and not smoke a pipe?"
3507,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3508,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,And now with his manly clothes and his manly pipe he was to be so
3509,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"happy! He had all that went to make up ""the honest miner."" True, he"
3510,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,did not let his father know about the pipe. He hid it under his pillow
3511,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"at night. He meant to have his first smoke at the sluice-box, as a"
3512,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,miner should.
3513,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3514,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Monday morning he was up with the sun and ready for his work. His
3515,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"father, who worked down the Gulch, had already gone before the"
3516,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,children had finished their breakfast. So now Jim filled his bran-new
3517,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,pipe very leisurely; and with as much calm unconcern as if he had been
3518,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"smoking for forty years, he stopped to scratch a match on the door as"
3519,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,he went out.
3520,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3521,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"From under his broad hat he saw his little sister watching him, and"
3522,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,he fairly swelled with importance as Stumps looked up at him with
3523,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,childish wonder. Leaving Madge to wash the few tin dishes and follow
3524,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"as she could with Little Stumps, he started on up the hill, pipe in"
3525,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,mouth.
3526,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3527,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"He met several miners, but he puffed away like a tug-boat against the"
3528,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"tide, and went on. His bright new boots whetted and creaked together,"
3529,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"the warm wind lifted the broad brim of his _sombrero_, and his bright"
3530,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"new red shirt was really beautiful, with the green grass and oaks"
3531,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,for a background--and so this brave young man climbed the hill to his
3532,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"mine. Ah, he was so happy!"
3533,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3534,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Suddenly, as he approached the claim, his knees began to smite"
3535,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"together, and he felt so weak he could hardly drag one foot after the"
3536,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,other. He threw down his pick; he began to tremble and spin around.
3537,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"The world seemed to be turning over and over, and he trying in vain to"
3538,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"hold on to it. He jerked the pipe from his teeth, and throwing it down"
3539,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"on the bank, he tumbled down too, and clutching at the grass with both"
3540,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"hands tried hard, oh! so hard, to hold the world from slipping from"
3541,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,under him.
3542,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3543,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Oh, Jim! you are white as snow,"" cried Madge as she came up."
3544,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3545,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""White as 'er sunshine, an' blue, an' green too, sisser. Look at"
3546,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"brurrer 'all colors,'"" piped Little Stumps pitifully."
3547,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3548,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""O, Jim, Jim--brother Jim, what is the matter?"" sobbed Madge."
3549,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3550,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Sunstroke,"" murmured the young man, smiling grimly, like a true"
3551,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Californian. ""No; it is not sunstroke, it's--it's cholera,"" he added"
3552,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,in dismay over his falsehood.
3553,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3554,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Poor boy! he was sorry for this second lie too. He fairly groaned in
3555,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,agony of body and soul.
3556,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3557,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"Oh, how he did hate that pipe! How he did want to get up and jump on"
3558,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,it and smash it into a thousand pieces! But he could not get up or
3559,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,turn around or move at all without betraying his unmanly secret.
3560,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3561,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"A couple of miners came up, but Jim feebly begged them to go."
3562,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3563,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Sunstroke,"" whispered the sister."
3564,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3565,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""No; tolera,"" piped poor Little Stumps."
3566,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3567,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Get out! Leave me!"" groaned the young red-shirted miner of the"
3568,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Sierras.
3569,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3570,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,The biggest of the two miners bent over him a moment.
3571,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3572,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Yes; it's both,"" he muttered. ""Cholera-nicotine-fantum!"" Then he"
3573,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"looked at his partner and winked wickedly. Without a word, he took"
3574,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,the limp young miner up in his arms and bore him down the hill to his
3575,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"father's cabin, while Stumps and Madge ran along at either side, and"
3576,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"tenderly and all the time kept asking what was good for ""cholera."""
3577,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3578,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"The other old ""honest miner"" lingered behind to pick up the baleful"
3579,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,pipe which he knew was somewhere there; and when the little party
3580,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"was far enough down the hill, he took it up and buried it in his own"
3581,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"capacious pocket with a half-sorrowful laugh. ""Poor little miner,"" he"
3582,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,sighed.
3583,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3584,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Don't ever swear any more, Windy,"" pleaded the boy to the miner who"
3585,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"had carried him down the hill, as he leaned over him, ""and don't never"
3586,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"lie. I am going to die, Windy, and I should like to be good. Windy, it"

3590,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3591,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Hush yer mouth,"" growled Windy. ""I know what 'tis! We've left it on"
3592,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"the hill."""
3593,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3594,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,The boy turned his face to the wall. The conviction was strong upon
3595,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"him that he was going to die, The world spun round now very, very fast"
3596,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"indeed. Finally, half-rising in bed, he called Little Stumps to his"
3597,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,side:
3598,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3599,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""Stumps, dear, good Little Stumps, if I die don't you never try for to"

3601,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,brother Stumps--don't you never try for to go the whole of the 'honest

3604,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3605,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"He sank back in bed and Little Stumps and his sister cried and cried,"
3606,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,and kissed him and kissed him.
3607,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3608,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"The miners who had gathered around loved him now, every one, for"
3609,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,daring to tell the truth and take the shame of his folly so bravely.
3610,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3611,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"""I'm going to die, Windy,"" groaned the boy."
3612,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,
3613,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,Windy could stand no more of it. He took Jim's hand with a cheery
3614,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"laugh. ""Git well in half an hour,"" said he, ""now that you've out with"
3615,THE LITTLE GOLD MINERS OF THE SIERRAS.,"the truth."""

3818,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"In the early days of Northern Ohio, when settlers were few and far"
3819,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"between, Evan Cogswell, a Welsh lad of sixteen years, found his way"
3820,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"thither and began his career as a laborer, receiving at first but two"
3821,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"dollars a month in addition to his board and ""home-made"" clothing. He"
3822,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"possessed an intelligent, energetic mind in a sound and vigorous body,"
3823,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,and had acquired in his native parish the elements of an education in
3824,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,both Welsh and English.
3825,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3826,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"The story of his life, outlined in a curious old diary containing"
3827,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the records of sixty-two years, and an entry for more than twenty-two"
3828,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"thousand days, would constitute a history of the region, and some of"
3829,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,its passages would read like high-wrought romance.
3830,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3831,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,His first term of service was with a border farmer on the banks of a
3832,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"stream called Grand River, in Ashtabula County. It was rather crude"
3833,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"farming, however, consisting mostly of felling trees, cutting wood and"
3834,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"saw-logs, burning brush, and digging out stumps, the axe and pick-axe"
3835,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,finding more use than ordinary farm implements.
3836,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3837,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Seven miles down the river, and on the opposite bank, lived the"
3838,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"nearest neighbors, among them a blacksmith who in his trade served"
3839,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,the whole country for twenty miles around. One especial part of his
3840,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"business was the repairing of axes, called in that day ""jumping,"" or"
3841,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"""upsetting."""
3842,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3843,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,In midwinter Evan's employer left a couple of axes with the blacksmith
3844,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"for repairs, the job to be done within a week. At this time the"
3845,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"weather was what is termed ""settled,"" with deep snow, and good"
3846,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"""slipping"" along the few wildwood roads."
3847,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3848,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"But three or four days later, there came a ""January thaw."" Rain and a"
3849,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"warmer temperature melted away much of the snow, the little river was"
3850,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"swelled to a great torrent, breaking up the ice and carrying it down"
3851,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"stream, and the roads became almost impassable. When the week was up"
3852,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"and the farmer wanted the axes, it was not possible for the horse to"
3853,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"travel, and after waiting vainly for a day or two for a turn in the"
3854,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"weather, Evan was posted off on foot to obtain the needed implements."
3855,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Delighting in the change and excitement of such a trip, the boy"
3856,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"started before noon, expecting to reach home again ere dark, as it was"
3857,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,not considered quite safe to journey far by night on account of the
3858,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,wolves.
3859,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3860,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Three miles below, at a narrow place in the river, was the bridge,"
3861,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,consisting of three very long tree-trunks reaching parallel from bank
3862,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"to bank, and covered with hewn plank. When Evan arrived here he found"
3863,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,that this bridge had been swept away. But pushing on down stream
3864,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"among the thickets, about half a mile below, he came upon an immense"
3865,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"ice-jam, stretching across the stream and piled many feet high. Upon"
3866,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,this he at once resolved to make his way over to the road on the
3867,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"other side, for he was already wearied threading the underbrush. Grand"
3868,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"River, which is a narrow but deep and violent stream, ran roaring"
3869,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,and plunging beneath the masses of ice as if enraged at being so
3870,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,obstructed; but the lad picked his path in safety and soon stood on
3871,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,the opposite bank.
3872,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3873,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Away he hurried now to the blacksmith's, so as to complete his errand"
3874,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,and return by this precarious crossing before dark.
3875,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3876,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,But the smith had neglected his duty and Evan had to wait an hour or
3877,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"more for the axes. At length they were done, and with one tied at each"
3878,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"end of a strong cord and this hung about his neck, he was off on the"
3879,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"homeward trip. To aid his walking, he procured from the thicket a"
3880,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,stout cane. He had hardly gone two miles when the duskiness gathering
3881,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,in the woods denoted the nearness of night; yet as the moon was riding
3882,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"high, he pushed on without fear."
3883,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3884,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,[Illustration: HOMEWARD. SAFELY INTRENCHED.]
3885,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3886,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"But as he was skirting a wind-fall of trees, he came suddenly upon two"
3887,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,or three wolves apparently emerging from their daytime hiding place
3888,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,for a hunting expedition. Evan was considerably startled; but as
3889,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"they ran off into the woods as if afraid of him, he took courage in"
3890,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the hope that they would not molest him. In a few minutes, however,"
3891,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,they set up that dismal howling by which they summon their mates and
3892,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,enlarge their numbers; and Evan discovered by the sounds that they
3893,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,were following him cautiously at no great distance.
3894,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3895,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,Frequent responses were also heard from more distant points in the
3896,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,woods and from across the river. By this time it was becoming quite
3897,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"dark, the moonlight penetrating the forest only along the roadway"
3898,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,and in occasional patches among the trees on either side. The rushing
3899,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"river was not far away, but above its roar arose every instant"
3900,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the threatening howl of a wolf. Finally, just as he reached the"
3901,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"ice-bridge, the howling became still, a sign that their numbers"
3902,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,emboldened them to enter in earnest on the pursuit. The species
3903,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"of wolf once so common in the central States, and making the early"
3904,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"farmers so much trouble, were peculiar in this respect; they were"
3905,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"great cowards singly, and would trail the heels of a traveler howling"
3906,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"for recruits, and not daring to begin the attack until they had"
3907,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,collected a force that insured success; then they became fierce and
3908,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"bold, and more to be dreaded than any other animal of the wilderness."
3909,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"And at this point, when they considered their numbers equal to the"
3910,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"occasion, the howling ceased."
3911,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3912,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Evan had been told of this, and when the silence began, he knew its"
3913,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"meaning, and his heart shuddered at the prospect. His only hope lay"
3914,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,in the possibility that they might not dare to follow him across the
3915,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"ice-bridge. But this hope vanished as he approached the other shore,"
3916,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,and saw by the moonlight several of the gaunt creatures awaiting
3917,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,him on that side. What should he do? No doubt they would soon muster
3918,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"boldness to follow him upon the ice, and then his fate would be sealed"
3919,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,in a moment.
3920,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3921,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"In the emergency he thought of the axes, and taking them from his"
3922,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"neck, cut the cord, and thrust his walking-stick into one as a helve,"
3923,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,resolved to defend himself to the last.
3924,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3925,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"At this instant he espied among the thick, upheaved ice-cakes two"
3926,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,great fragments leaning against each other in such a way as to form a
3927,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,roof with something like a small room underneath. Here he saw his only
3928,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"chance. Springing within, he used the axe to chip off other fragments"
3929,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"with which to close up the entrance, and almost quicker than it can"
3930,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"be told, had thus constructed a sort of fort, which he believed would"
3931,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,withstand the attack of the wolves. At nightfall the weather had
3932,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"become colder, and he knew that in a few minutes the damp pieces of"
3933,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,ice would be firmly cemented together.
3934,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3935,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Hardly had he lifted the last piece to its place, when the pack came"
3936,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"rushing about him, snapping and snarling, but at first not testing the"
3937,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,strength of his intrenchment. When soon they began to spring against
3938,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"it, and snap at the corners of ice, the frost had done its work, and"
3939,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,they could not loosen his hastily built wall.
3940,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3941,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Through narrow crevices he could look out at them, and at one time"
3942,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,counted sixteen grouped together in council. As the cold increased he
3943,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"had to keep in motion in order not to freeze, and any extra action on"
3944,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,his part increased the fierceness of the wolves. At times they would
3945,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"gather in a circle around him, and after sniffing at him eagerly, set"
3946,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"up a doleful howling, as if deploring the excellent supper they had"
3947,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,lost.
3948,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3949,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,Ere long one of them found an opening at a corner large enough to
3950,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"admit its head; but Evan was on the alert, and gave it such a blow"
3951,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"with the axe as to cause its death. Soon another tried the same thing,"
3952,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"and met with the same reception, withdrawing and whirling around"
3953,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"several times, and then dropping dead with a broken skull."
3954,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3955,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"One smaller than the rest attempting to enter, and receiving the fatal"
3956,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"blow, crawled, in its dying agony, completely into the enclosure, and"
3957,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"lay dead at Evan's feet. Of this he was not sorry, as his feet were"
3958,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"bitterly cold, and the warm carcass of the animal served to relieve"
3959,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,them.
3960,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3961,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,In the course of the night six wolves were killed as they sought to
3962,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"creep into his fortress, and several others so seriously hacked as"
3963,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"to send them to the woods again; and, however correct the notion that"
3964,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"when on the hunt they devour their fallen comrades, in this case they"
3965,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"did no such thing, as in the morning the six dead bodies lay about"
3966,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"on the ice, and Evan had the profitable privilege of taking off their"
3967,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,skins.
3968,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3969,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Of his thoughts during the night, a quotation from his diary is"
3970,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,quaintly suggestive and characteristic.
3971,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3972,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"""I bethought me of the wars of Glendower, which I have read about, and"
3973,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the battle of Grosmont Castle; and I said, 'I am Owen Glendower;"
3974,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,this is my castle; the wolves are the army of Henry; but I will never
3975,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"surrender or yield as did Glendower.'"""
3976,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3977,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"Toward morning, as the change of weather continued, and the waters of"
3978,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the river began to diminish, there was suddenly a prodigious crack and"
3979,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"crash of the ice-bridge, and the whole mass settled several inches."
3980,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"At this the wolves took alarm, and in an instant fled. Perhaps they"
3981,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,might have returned had not the crackling of the ice been repeated
3982,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,frequently.
3983,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3984,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"At length Evan became alarmed for his safety, lest the ice should"
3985,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"break up in the current, and bringing his axe to bear, soon burst"
3986,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"his way out and fled to the shore. But not seeing the ice crumble, he"
3987,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"ventured back to obtain the other axe, and then hastened home to his"
3988,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,employer.
3989,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,
3990,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"During the day he skinned the wolves, and within a fortnight pocketed"
3991,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"the bounty money, amounting in all to about one hundred and fifty"
3992,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"dollars. With this money he made the first payment on a large farm,"
3993,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,"which he long lived to cultivate and enjoy, and under the sod of which"
3994,EVAN COGWELL'S ICE FORT.,he found a quiet grave.

4203,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),the braided woollen mat before the fire. Then for a moment there was
4204,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"silence, for he wore the dress of a British soldier, and his right arm"
4205,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"was bandaged. He had fainted from loss of blood, apparently--perhaps"
4206,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"from hunger. Basha loosened his coat at the throat, and tried to force"

4224,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),Basha.
4225,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4226,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),Little by little the pitiful story was told. He was an American
4227,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),soldier who had been doing duty as a spy in the British camp. Up to
4228,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),the very last day of his stay he had not been suspected; but trying to
4229,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"get away he was suspected, challenged, and fired at. The shot passed"
4230,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),through his arm. He was certain his pursuers had followed him till
4231,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"night, and they would be likely to continue the search the next day,"
4232,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"and he begged Mrs. Heath to secrete him for a day or two, if possible."
4233,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4234,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"""I wouldn't mind being shot, marm,"" he said, ""but you know they'll"
4235,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),hang me if they get me. Of course I risked it when I went into their
4236,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"camp, but it's none the pleasanter for all that."""
4237,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4238,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Now in the old Heath house there was a secret chamber, built in the"
4239,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),side of the chimney. Most of those old colonial houses had enormous
4240,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"chimneys, that took up, sometimes, a quarter of the ground occupied"
4241,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"by the house, so it was not a difficult thing to enclose a small"
4242,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),space with slight danger of its existence being detected. This chimney
4243,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),chamber in the Heath house was little more than a closet eight feet by
4244,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"four. It was entered from the north chamber, Abram's room, through a"
4245,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"narrow sliding panel that looked exactly like the rest of the wall,"
4246,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),which was of cedar boards. An inch-wide shaft running up the side
4247,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"of the chimney ventilated the closet, and it was lighted by a window"
4248,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),consisting of three small panes of glass carefully concealed under the

4292,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"did this almost every day during berry time, so as to have what they"

4294,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"they had huckleberry ""slap-jacks,"" also a favorite dish, for"

4428,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"china and glasses, and knew they were at supper. By and by a servant"

4485,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),was.
4486,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4487,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),Her gown was of some rich stuff that shimmered in the light of the
4488,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"candle she carried, and rustled musically as she walked. There was"
4489,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),a flash of jewels at her throat and on her hands. She had wrapped a
4490,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),crimson mantle about her head and shoulders. Her eyes were like stars
4491,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"on a summer's night, sparkling with a veiled radiance, and as she"
4492,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"stood and looked down upon the sleeping boy, a smile, sweet, but full"
4493,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"of a profound sadness, played upon her lips. Then a determined look"
4494,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),came into her bright eyes.
4495,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4496,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"He stirred in his sleep, laughed out, said ""mamma,"" and then opened"
4497,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"his eyes. She stooped and touched his lips with her finger. ""Hush!"
4498,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Speak only in a whisper. Eat this, and then I will take you to your"

4500,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4501,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"After he had eaten, she wrapped a cloak about him, and together they"
4502,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"stole up and out past the sleeping, drunken sentinel, to the stables."
4503,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"She lead out a white horse, her own horse, Arthur was sure, for the"
4504,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"creature caressed her with his head, and as she saddled him she talked"
4505,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"to him in low tones, sweet, musical words of some foreign tongue. The"
4506,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"handsome horse seemed to understand the necessity of silence, for"
4507,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"he did not even whinny to the touch of his mistress' hand, and trod"
4508,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"daintily and noiselessly as she led him to the mounting block, his"
4509,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"small ears pricking forward and backward, as though knowing the need"
4510,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),of watchful listening.
4511,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4512,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Leaping to the saddle and stooping, she lifted Arthur in front of her,"
4513,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"and with a word they were off. A slow walk at first, and then a rapid"
4514,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),canter. Arthur never forgot that long night ride with the beautiful
4515,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"lady on the white horse, over the country flooded with the brilliancy"
4516,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"of the full moon. Once or twice she asked him if he was cold, as she"
4517,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"drew the cloak more closely about him, and sometimes she would murmur"
4518,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"softly to herself words in that silvery, foreign tongue. As they drew"
4519,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"near Hartland, she asked him to point out his father's house, and"
4520,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"when they were quite near, only a little distance off, she stopped the"
4521,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),horse.
4522,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4523,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"""I leave you here, you brave, darling boy,"" she said. ""Kiss me once,"
4524,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"and then jump down. And don't forget me."""
4525,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4526,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Arthur threw his arms around her neck and kissed her, first on one"
4527,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"cheek and then on the other, and looking up into the beautiful face"
4528,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"with its starry eyes, said:"
4529,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4530,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"""I will never, never forget you, for you are the loveliest lady I ever"

4533,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"She laughed a pleased laugh, like a child, then took a ring from her"
4534,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),hand and put it on one of Arthur's fingers. Her hand was so slender it
4535,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),fitted his chubby little hand very well.
4536,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4537,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"""Keep this,"" she said, ""and by and by give it to some lady good and"
4538,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"true, like mamma."""
4539,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4540,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"""Will you be punished?"" he said, keeping her hand. She laughed again,"
4541,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"with a proud, daring toss of her dainty head, and rode away."
4542,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),
4543,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Arthur watched her out of sight, and then turned towards home. Mrs."
4544,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"Heath was still keeping her lonely watch, when the latch of the outer"

4546,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"with Arty outside--the inner door swung noiselessly back, and the"
4547,(_A STORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION._),"blithe voice said, ""Mamma! mamma! here I am, and I didn't tell."""
