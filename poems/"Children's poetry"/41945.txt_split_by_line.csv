151,DREAM-BLOCKS,WITH dream-blocks I can build
152,DREAM-BLOCKS,A castle to the sky.
153,DREAM-BLOCKS,"No one can shake it down,"
154,DREAM-BLOCKS,"Though he may try and try,"
155,DREAM-BLOCKS,"Except myself, and then,"
156,DREAM-BLOCKS,"I make another one,"
157,DREAM-BLOCKS,And shape it as I please.
158,DREAM-BLOCKS,This castle-building fun
159,DREAM-BLOCKS,"Nobody takes away,"
160,DREAM-BLOCKS,And what I like the best--
161,DREAM-BLOCKS,The dream-blocks change each day.

185,ANAGRAMS,A word named _sorrow_--then I tried
186,ANAGRAMS,To change it all about
187,ANAGRAMS,To make it spell another word.
188,ANAGRAMS,"My mother said, ""There is a way"
189,ANAGRAMS,"To make the sorrow-word spell peace."""
190,ANAGRAMS,"I've tried and tried, almost all day;"
191,ANAGRAMS,"I've turned the letters round and round,"
192,ANAGRAMS,"This way and that, to find out how,"

206,DOORSTEPS,
207,DOORSTEPS,I think some day that I may see
208,DOORSTEPS,A little brownie elf
209,DOORSTEPS,"Peep out of there, and speak to me,"
210,DOORSTEPS,When I am by myself.
211,DOORSTEPS,
212,DOORSTEPS,"I like my roses at the side,"
213,DOORSTEPS,Much better than the flower-row
214,DOORSTEPS,Along your path where people ride.
215,DOORSTEPS,I leave my roses just to grow.
216,DOORSTEPS,
217,DOORSTEPS,"I like the place that's broken, too,"
218,DOORSTEPS,"With splintered edges all around,"
219,DOORSTEPS,"And grasses growing right up through,"
220,DOORSTEPS,That smell so fresh like dew and ground.
221,DOORSTEPS,
222,DOORSTEPS,"Your steps are nice, but then my own"
223,DOORSTEPS,"Seem nicer somehow, just for me;"
224,DOORSTEPS,"Pine steps are more like home than stone,"
225,DOORSTEPS,For once they lived and were a tree.

237,THE BIG CLOCK,"With nice, clean clothes on, dressed to go"
238,THE BIG CLOCK,Out with Aunt Beth to see the bears
239,THE BIG CLOCK,And funny possums at the Zoo!
240,THE BIG CLOCK,"But oh, at night how fast"
241,THE BIG CLOCK,Our Big Clock goes! It's very rude
242,THE BIG CLOCK,"To company, and when time's past"
243,THE BIG CLOCK,"When I must always go to bed,"
244,THE BIG CLOCK,The hands just fly in wicked glee.
245,THE BIG CLOCK,It strikes out long ahead
246,THE BIG CLOCK,And makes them all look round at me.

259,THE NEW DRESS,"It's made of pink and white,"
260,THE NEW DRESS,"And there are ribbons on it, too,"
261,THE NEW DRESS,Which make it bright.
262,THE NEW DRESS,
263,THE NEW DRESS,And yet I think I like it less
264,THE NEW DRESS,Than this dear other one--
265,THE NEW DRESS,"The worn-out, patched-up blue"
266,THE NEW DRESS,I wear when I have fun.
267,THE NEW DRESS,
268,THE NEW DRESS,It clings to me as if it loved
269,THE NEW DRESS,To have me wear it every day.
270,THE NEW DRESS,The pink stands out so straight and stiff
271,THE NEW DRESS,It's in my way.
272,THE NEW DRESS,
273,THE NEW DRESS,"How can I get to know it well,"
274,THE NEW DRESS,When it's so _Sunday_-clean?
275,THE NEW DRESS,Perhaps when it is old and stained
276,THE NEW DRESS,"With dust and grass, it will not seem"
277,THE NEW DRESS,So strange and dignified as now.
278,THE NEW DRESS,But then I think
279,THE NEW DRESS,I never _could_ make mud pies right
280,THE NEW DRESS,If I had on my pink.

318,A QUANDARY,"The little boy that's I, must go"

323,A QUANDARY,Must I go there quite by myself?

338,SPRING MUSIC,I HEARD a violin one day--
339,SPRING MUSIC,It sounded like the Spring;
340,SPRING MUSIC,"Like woolly lambs at play,"
341,SPRING MUSIC,Like baby birds that sing
342,SPRING MUSIC,"In snatches, when they're learning how."
343,SPRING MUSIC,I know the one who played
344,SPRING MUSIC,"Could see pink blossoms on a bough,"
345,SPRING MUSIC,Where children came beneath its shade
346,SPRING MUSIC,To make white clover in a crown.
347,SPRING MUSIC,"Then while they laughed there in the grass,"
348,SPRING MUSIC,Soft petals fluttered down;
349,SPRING MUSIC,"They hushed and saw some angels pass,"
350,SPRING MUSIC,With friendly eyes that smile--
351,SPRING MUSIC,The kind that I have often seen
352,SPRING MUSIC,"When mother sings awhile,"
353,SPRING MUSIC,Just as I go to sleep and dream.
354,SPRING MUSIC,
355,SPRING MUSIC,I held my breath and then there rose
356,SPRING MUSIC,The last sweet note so high.
357,SPRING MUSIC,I felt as when the sunshine goes--
358,SPRING MUSIC,I could not help but cry.

368,A COMPROMISE,"But then the dark-time lasts so long,"
369,A COMPROMISE,"And God seems--oh, so far away!--"
370,A COMPROMISE,"That when the lights are out awhile,"
371,A COMPROMISE,I clamber out of bed once more
372,A COMPROMISE,And pour my pennies in a pile.
373,A COMPROMISE,"... I listen at the door,"
374,A COMPROMISE,"And then I get upon my knees,"
375,A COMPROMISE,"And whisper just for God to hear,"
376,A COMPROMISE,"To ask him, oh, just once more, _please_,"
377,A COMPROMISE,"Will he forgive and come back near,"

390,A RAINY DAY,"Because I couldn't run and play,"
391,A RAINY DAY,Out in the sunshine and the grass.
392,A RAINY DAY,It's queer how such a day can pass
393,A RAINY DAY,"So soon, before you know it 'most,"
394,A RAINY DAY,"And while I eat my milk and toast,"
395,A RAINY DAY,"Before I go to bed, I think"
396,A RAINY DAY,I've never had a day so _pink_.
397,A RAINY DAY,"Without the sun to make the shine,"
398,A RAINY DAY,This whole day long has been just mine
399,A RAINY DAY,"And Mother's, in the fireplace glow.--"
400,A RAINY DAY,"Because it rained, it made it so."

412,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"The telephone and phonograph,"
413,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"The watch that tells how far you've gone,"
414,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,Would just invent some bottled sleep
415,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"That we could take at night,"
416,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,And then again when it grows light.
417,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,It might keep little boys awake
418,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,When there is company.
419,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"All I should have to do, would be"
420,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,To pour a glass of sleep to take.
421,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,
422,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"The things I leave undone,"
423,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"Because I haven't time enough,"
424,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,The things I've only half begun--
425,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"My castle-house, my doll-queen's ruff--"
426,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,I'd get quite finished in a day.
427,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"I'd have some time left over, too."
428,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,I'd have the chance to do new things.
429,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"And first of all, I'd learn to play"
430,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"The games the flowers frolic through,"
431,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,"Each afternoon, and I'd find who"
432,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,Has charge of yesterday.
433,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,
434,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,I think that made-to-order dreams
435,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,Of rainbow-folk and orange-creams
436,AN APPEAL TO SCIENCE,Would be much nicer than the kind

444,THE RUNAWAY,
445,THE RUNAWAY,THERE'S something that is calling me--
446,THE RUNAWAY,Far off from Here--
447,THE RUNAWAY,"It calls for me to come and see,"
448,THE RUNAWAY,Away from Near.
449,THE RUNAWAY,
450,THE RUNAWAY,Sometimes it tinkles like a bell.
451,THE RUNAWAY,"Then echo songs above the blue,"
452,THE RUNAWAY,And sometimes silver whistles tell
453,THE RUNAWAY,About a shining dream come true.
454,THE RUNAWAY,This call sings low of wonder-worlds.
455,THE RUNAWAY,It tells in runs and soft-blown trills
456,THE RUNAWAY,Of hidden places near that line
457,THE RUNAWAY,Where distance smooths the little hills.
458,THE RUNAWAY,
459,THE RUNAWAY,The call is begging me to come.
460,THE RUNAWAY,It makes me dance and sing
461,THE RUNAWAY,"Along the meadow road,"
462,THE RUNAWAY,Far past the street's dust-ring.
463,THE RUNAWAY,
464,THE RUNAWAY,"There's something waiting just for me,"
465,THE RUNAWAY,"And I must go--_must go_,"
466,THE RUNAWAY,"Away from houses here, to see,"
467,THE RUNAWAY,Where lights begin to glow.

478,PLAYMATES,TO-DAY I met a rabbit in the path
479,PLAYMATES,"Who stopped and looked at me,"
480,PLAYMATES,While I was laughing at a frog
481,PLAYMATES,Hop sidewise from a bee.
482,PLAYMATES,
483,PLAYMATES,The little rabbit's eyes laughed too.
484,PLAYMATES,He would have like to stay;
485,PLAYMATES,"And if my clothes had been like his,"
486,PLAYMATES,He might have come to play.
487,PLAYMATES,
488,PLAYMATES,"I wish I had a rabbit dress,"
489,PLAYMATES,"A furry one, from head to toe,"
490,PLAYMATES,Then I could go away with him
491,PLAYMATES,"From streets in line, all set just so."
492,PLAYMATES,
493,PLAYMATES,I think my clothes are stupid things

1002,THE RING CHARM,"The sad things into gay,"
1003,THE RING CHARM,And keep me safe and well.
1004,THE RING CHARM,"I wear it every day,"
1005,THE RING CHARM,For that's to keep the spell.
1006,THE RING CHARM,
1007,THE RING CHARM,"Each morning when I wake,"
