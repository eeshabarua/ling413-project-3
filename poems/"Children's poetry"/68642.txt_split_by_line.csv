180,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"The little bulb house is a house of brown,"
181,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Its doors are locked and its blinds are down
182,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Winds may whistle and winds may creep,"
183,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,The little brown house is a house of sleep.
184,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
185,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,But when the sun gives a golden knock
186,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,The blinds go up and the doors unlock.
187,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"The sleepy tenant will softly stir,"
188,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,And throw off the garment that covers her.
189,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
190,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And she will put on her dress with care,"
191,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"A Hyacinth lady, tall and fair."
192,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,All this magic in scent and blue

202,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
203,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"I like His picture of the field the best,"
204,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"With grass, and sky that meets it, and the rest"
205,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
206,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Of very lovely things I cannot name--

213,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
214,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Of all the colours God has made

226,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,A little Grey Girl in a little Grey Cloak

237,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"There are rich little boys in the big, wide world,"
238,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And rich little girls, I'm told."
239,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,But the poorest child is the richest child
240,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,If he gathers Buttercup gold.
241,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
242,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,God puts it out in the grassy fields
243,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,For anyone passing there.
244,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Come, gather the Buttercup gold with me,"

250,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,_The Green Bank of England_
251,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
252,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Have you seen the gold in the Green Bank of England?
253,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Wonderful, beautiful, lovely to behold--"
254,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Aconite and coltsfoot, buttercup and daffodil,"
255,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Crocus and celandine, and dandelion bold!"
256,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
257,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Have you found the gold in the Green Bank of England?
258,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,You may go and take it--none of it is sold.
259,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Gorse, broom, and ragwort, bedstraw and cowslip,"
260,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Kingcup and pansy, and silver-weed gold."
261,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
262,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Yours is the gold in the Green Bank of England,"
263,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Yours for the asking--treasury untold;
264,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Potentilla, primrose, yellow vetch, and trefoil,"

286,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,And a dear little round front door;
287,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"A nibble, nibble, along the edge,"
288,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,And one little nibble more.
289,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
290,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"A whispering rustle in yellow wheat,"
291,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"The clink of a milking-pail,"
292,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And a sudden scamper of furry feet,"
293,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,And the bob of a little white tail.

314,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
315,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,_Songs of the Pine-wood_
316,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
317,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,There was a little seaside breeze who loved to dance and play;
318,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,He'd rush along the yellow sands and fly across the bay;
319,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And when the frothy billows began to sway and roll,"
320,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,He'd find the highest seaweed rock and rest his little soul.
321,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
322,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"But other breezes came along, ten thousand and a score;"
323,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,They pushed and jostled all the day upon the sea and shore;
324,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And little breeze got weary of rough and noisy play,"
325,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Said he, ""I'll find another home--it's time I went away."""
326,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,
327,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"He spread his wings of silver light and flew across the foam,"
328,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,And in a wood of scented pines he found his little home.
329,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"So, if you stop and listen, you'll hear the little breeze"
330,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,As he sings his sweet sea-music in the branches of the trees.

341,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"With the silver down upon it,"
342,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Says good-bye to sleeping
343,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,When the sun comes peeping.
344,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,

349,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"Scarlet crinkled frillinesses,"
350,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Knows what she is doing
351,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,When the bees come wooing.

369,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,Stand on the edge with flapping wings.
370,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,They give each eye a merry wink
371,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And stoop to take a little drink,"
372,_FIELD AND GARDEN_,"And then, before I'm fairly gone,"

489,_FAIRIES_,Is the little moss.
490,_FAIRIES_,
491,_FAIRIES_,"Fairy fronds of green,"
492,_FAIRIES_,"Spreading out are seen,"
493,_FAIRIES_,"Very soft and neat,"
494,_FAIRIES_,Fit for fairy feet.
495,_FAIRIES_,
496,_FAIRIES_,"If you see it there,"

510,_FAIRIES_,
511,_FAIRIES_,"A fairy heard him crying there,"
512,_FAIRIES_,So like a loving elf
513,_FAIRIES_,"She found she had a wing to spare,"
514,_FAIRIES_,The kind she wore herself.
515,_FAIRIES_,
516,_FAIRIES_,She fixed it on--her dainty wing--
517,_FAIRIES_,With bits of softest cloth;

532,_FAIRIES_,"Oh, yes, they're in our cupboard,"
533,_FAIRIES_,'Cos I _know_!
534,_FAIRIES_,
535,_FAIRIES_,I _know_ they're in our cupboard--
536,_FAIRIES_,"One night I heard a chink,"
537,_FAIRIES_,"I guess they like our china,"
538,_FAIRIES_,It's rather thin and pink!
539,_FAIRIES_,"It's very smooth and shiny,"
540,_FAIRIES_,For a tiny fairy toe--
541,_FAIRIES_,"Oh, yes, they're in our cupboard,"
542,_FAIRIES_,'Cos I _know_!
543,_FAIRIES_,
544,_FAIRIES_,"And once when I was peeping,"
545,_FAIRIES_,"And it was rather late,"
546,_FAIRIES_,I saw a ring of fairies
547,_FAIRIES_,Upon the biggest plate!
548,_FAIRIES_,"And there, upon the teapot,"
549,_FAIRIES_,I saw a _perfect row_--
550,_FAIRIES_,"Oh, yes, they're in our cupboard,"
551,_FAIRIES_,'Cos I _know_!
552,_FAIRIES_,
553,_FAIRIES_,"I _know_ they're in our cupboard,"
554,_FAIRIES_,I've _heard_ them in the jug;
555,_FAIRIES_,"They scramble on the saucers,"
556,_FAIRIES_,And hide inside my mug.
557,_FAIRIES_,Their babies _love_ the egg-cups--
558,_FAIRIES_,They stand inside them--so!

571,_FAIRIES_,Quarter to ten and five to ten
572,_FAIRIES_,"Ticked from the dandelion clock again,"
573,_FAIRIES_,"But Fairy Frilly was deaf to all,"
574,_FAIRIES_,_And ten was the time of the fairy ball!_
575,_FAIRIES_,
576,_FAIRIES_,"Little West Wind came by that way,"
577,_FAIRIES_,"And he pulled off the petal where Frilly lay,"
578,_FAIRIES_,"Pulled it off with the fairy on it,"
579,_FAIRIES_,And blew with a great big breath upon it.
580,_FAIRIES_,"Off sailed the petal, Frilly and all--"

596,_FAIRIES_,
597,_FAIRIES_,Now Brother Snail was passing by;
598,_FAIRIES_,He heard the little fairy cry;
599,_FAIRIES_,"He stopped awhile and then turned back,"
600,_FAIRIES_,And made for her a silver track!
601,_FAIRIES_,
602,_FAIRIES_,"So if _you_ take a walk to-day,"

613,_FAIRIES_,It would be a disgraceful thing to leave a broken cup.
614,_FAIRIES_,"They roll up bits of paper, and hide the orange-skin,"
615,_FAIRIES_,And find a most convenient hole to put the rubbish in!
616,_FAIRIES_,
617,_FAIRIES_,"When fairies have a picnic they see the fire is out,"
618,_FAIRIES_,For fear that Brother Wind may come and scatter it about.
619,_FAIRIES_,"They leave a pile of brushwood, as that is nice and dry,"
620,_FAIRIES_,For other picnic people who are certain to pass by!
621,_FAIRIES_,
622,_FAIRIES_,"When fairies have a picnic they never break the trees,"
623,_FAIRIES_,"They smooth the grass and daisy-buds as gently as you please,"
624,_FAIRIES_,"And packing up their baskets they softly steal away,"

657,_FAIRIES_,
658,_FAIRIES_,"I cuddled tightly in my bed, the clothes up round my chin,"
659,_FAIRIES_,And kept my eyes awake to watch the fairy coming in.
660,_FAIRIES_,
661,_FAIRIES_,"I counted patterns on the wall and pictures just the same,"
662,_FAIRIES_,To help to while the time away until the fairy came.
663,_FAIRIES_,
664,_FAIRIES_,"The little clock went tick-a-tock, the wind sang round the house,"
665,_FAIRIES_,I heard a step upon the floor as soft as any mouse.
666,_FAIRIES_,
667,_FAIRIES_,"I watched the door so carefully--I didn't want to miss,"
668,_FAIRIES_,But it was only _Mother dear_ who came to have a kiss.

781,_HOME_,
782,_HOME_,And if I want to leave my crust
783,_HOME_,I eat it 'cos I feel I must.
784,_HOME_,
785,_HOME_,"She has a Sunday-morning look,"
786,_HOME_,"And reads a fat, improving book."

886,_HOME_,I ain't a-going to bed at all; the best time for a lark

941,_HOME_,"I see the Dark come riding by--he looks so big and tall,"
942,_HOME_,And when I think I am asleep I'm not asleep at all;
943,_HOME_,And so I pull the bedclothes up and tuck them round my chin
944,_HOME_,To stop the little bits of Dark from trying to get in.
945,_HOME_,
946,_HOME_,"But somehow all the horrid clothes seem slipping off from me,"
