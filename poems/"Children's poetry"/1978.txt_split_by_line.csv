49,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,The Little New Year
50,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
51,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,One cold morning Maurice awoke from his dreams and sat up in bed and
52,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,listened. He thought he heard a knock at his window; but though the moon
53,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"was shining brightly, Jack Frost had been so busily at work that Maurice"
54,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,could not see through the thickly painted panes. So he crept sleepily
55,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"out of bed, and opened the window, and whispered: ""Who is there?"""
56,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
57,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""I am,"" replied a tinkling voice. ""I am the little New Year, ho! ho! And"
58,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,I've promised to bring a blessing to everyone. But I am such a little
59,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,fellow I need somebody to help me distribute them. Won't you please come
60,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"out and help?"""
61,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
62,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Oh, it's so cold!"" said Maurice; ""I'd rather go back to my warm bed;"""
63,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""and he shivered as Jack Frost, who was passing, tickled him under the"
64,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,chin with one of the frosty paint brushes.
65,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
66,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Never mind the cold,"" urged the New Year; ""please help me."""
67,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
68,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"So Maurice hurried into his clothes, and was soon out in the yard. There"
69,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"he found a rosy-cheeked boy a little smaller than himself, pulling a"
70,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,large cart which seemed to be loaded with good things. On one side of
71,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"this cart was painted the word ""Love,"" and on the other ""Kindness."" As"
72,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"soon as the New Year saw Maurice he said, ""Now please take hold and help"
73,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"me pull;"" and down the driveway and up the hill they travelled until"
74,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,they came to an old shanty.
75,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
76,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Here is where I make my first call,"" said the New Year. Maurice looked"
77,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"wonderingly at him. ""Why, nobody lives here but an old colored man who"
78,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"works for us; and he hasn't any children!"" ""He needs my help,"" said"
79,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the New Year; ""for grown people like to be thought of just as much as"
80,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"children do. You shovel out a path to his door, while I unload some of"
81,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"my blessings; and the little hands went busily at work, piling up warm"
82,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"clothing, wood, and a new year's dinner, the New Year singing as he"
83,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,worked:--
84,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
85,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Oh, I am the little New Year; ho! ho!"
86,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Here I come tripping it over the snow,"
87,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Shaking my bells with a merry din;
88,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"So open your door and let me in."""
89,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
90,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Old Joe, hearing some noise outside, came to the door, and when he saw"
91,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,all the nice gifts the tears ran down his cheeks for gladness; and as he
92,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"carried them into the house, he whispered: ""The dear Lord has been here"
93,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"to-night."""
94,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
95,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Where am we going now?"" asked Maurice, as they ran down the hill. ""To"
96,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"take some flowers to a poor sick girl,"" answered the New Year."
97,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
98,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Soon they came to a small white house, where the New Year stopped. ""Why,"
99,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Bessie, our sewing girl lives, here,"" said Maurice. ""I didn't know she"
100,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"was sick."" ""See,"" said the New Year, ""this window is open a little; let"
101,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,us throw this bunch of pinks into the room. They will please her when
102,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"she wakes, and will make her happy for several days."""
103,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
104,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Then they hurried to other places, leaving some blessing behind them."
105,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
106,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""What a wonderful cart you have,"" said Maurice; ""though you have taken"
107,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"so much out, it never seems to get empty."" ""You are right, Maurice,"
108,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,there is never any end to love and kindness. As long as I find people to
109,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"love and be kind to, my cart is full of blessings for them; and it will"
110,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,never grow empty until I can no longer find people to help. If you will
111,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"go with me every day and help me scatter my blessings, you will see how"
112,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"happy you will be all the long year."""
113,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
114,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""A happy New Year!"" called some one; and Maurice found himself in bed,"
115,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"and his sister standing in the doorway smiling at him. ""Have you had a"
116,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"pleasant dream, dear?"" she asked."
117,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
118,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Why, where is the little New Year?"" said Maurice; ""he was just here"
119,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"with me."""
120,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
121,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Come into Mamma's room and see what he has brought you,"" answered his"
122,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"sister. There in a snowy white cradle he found a tiny baby brother, the"
123,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,gift of the New Year. How happy Maurice was then! But he did not forget
124,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"his dream. Old Joe and Bessie had their gifts, too, and Maurice tried so"
125,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,hard to be helpful that he made all his friends glad because the happy
126,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,New Year had come.
127,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
128,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
129,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
130,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
131,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Mother Nature's House Cleaning
132,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
133,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,One morning Mother Nature stood at the door of her house looking out
134,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,over the world. King Winter's reign was over and he had gone back to
135,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,his home at the North Pole; and Spring was coming over the hill with her
136,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,three little helpers to make Mother Nature a visit.
137,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
138,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Let us see who these helpers were. First there was roguish March with
139,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"his rosy cheeks, and his curly hair flying in the winds that blew"
140,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"all about him. Next came Baby April with her apron full of violets,"
141,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"daffodillies, and green grasses. Part of the time she smiled sweetly,"
142,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,and part of it she frowned till the big tear drops chased each other
143,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"down her cheeks. Last came May, playing tag with the sunbeams, wandering"
144,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"knee-deep in flowers, and calling to the birds that sang around her:"
145,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
146,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Mother Nature watched them coming and murmured, ""Such a dirty world as"
147,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,King Winter has left behind him! It must be cleaned up before the little
148,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"girls, April and May, come, but March I am sure will want to help me do"
149,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"it."""
150,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
151,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,She beckoned to the frolicsome boy who came racing down the hill to
152,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"see what she wanted. ""I must have some rain to wash away all this dirty"
153,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"snow,"" she said; so March whistled to the East Wind, who blew together"
154,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the rain-clouds, and soon the tiny rain drops were busy at work washing"
155,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the floors of the world, and in a short time the snow was all gone."
156,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Then Mother Nature wanted the sky ceilings cleaned, so this time March"
157,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,whistled to the West Wind who began to sweep away the cloud cobwebs from
158,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the sky till the cheery old sun smiled again, and shone Mother Nature a"
159,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"bright ""good morning."""
160,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
161,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Now March,"" said she, ""there is one more thing you can do to help. You"
162,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"must start the work for Baby April."" Then March, with the South Wind"
163,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"to help him, awoke the seeds, whispered to the trees to begin to bud,"
164,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"started the brooks singing, and called the robins back from the South."
165,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
166,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,When his visit was over Mother Nature thanked him for helping her so
167,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"well on all of the thirty-one days he had spent with her, and told him"
168,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,she would send for him again when her next cleaning day came around.
169,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
170,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
171,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
172,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
173,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,How the Raindrops and Sunbeams Helped
174,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
175,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"One morning Mother Nature looked about her, and said: ""My children have"
176,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"had such a nice long rest and it will do them good, for they have a busy"
177,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"summer before them. It is time to go to work now, and as some of the"
178,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"babies just won't wake up till they have to, I must send for my helpers"
179,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"at once."" The long days carried her messages, which in our language"
180,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,would have read something like this:--
181,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
182,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"My Dear Helpers, Sunbeams, and Raindrops:--"
183,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
184,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,You are needed down here on earth. It is time to dress my plant
185,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"children, and give them work to do. The birds must be called back from"
186,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the South, and the cocooons must be opened so that my butterflies can"
187,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,come out. I shall have to make good soil and get my clover beds ready
188,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"for the honey makers. Come at once, as some have been sleeping too long"
189,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,already. Whisper to the trees as you pass that it is time they were
190,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"budding, Be gentle with all, for they are my children, and I love them."
191,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
192,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Good-bye, from your Mother Nature"
193,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
194,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"This she directed to the Sunbeams at Blue Sky Park, and the Raindrops at"
195,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Cloud Land. When the message reached these little helpers, they started"
196,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"off at once to obey the call, and the sun gave such a merry laugh, that"
197,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Grandma came to the door of the farm house and remarked: ""How warm it"
198,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"is today, quite like spring; I believe I will set out my geraniums."" But"
199,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"just then a silvery voice said: ""Wait a little while longer till we make"
200,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the ground soft,"" and pop came a raindrop upon the dear old lady's"
201,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"nose, and she hurried into the house, saying ""What queer weather we are"
202,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"having! first sun and then rain."" Then the Raindrops and Sunbeams smiled"
203,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"at each other, and danced more merrily, for they knew what good work"
204,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,they were doing to the great brown house where the flowers dwell.
205,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
206,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"The tap, tap, of the Raindrops wake them up, and when they raised their"
207,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"sleepy heads and felt the warm kisses of the Sunbeams, they were glad"
208,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"and began to grow. Soft breezes called to the leaves to come out, and"
209,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,soon the brown coats which the trees had worn all winter were replaced
210,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,by new green dresses. Pussy willow and snowdrop were the first to
211,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"herald the spring, and crocus and violet soon followed. Out in the woods"
212,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,blossomed tiny pink and white May flowers. Little seeds burst off their
213,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,jackets and sent up green plumes. Then Mother Nature called her helpers
214,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"again and told them to search for the lilies, and dress them in white"
215,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,robes for Easter. And so each beautiful flower came again--and the birds
216,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"sang once more, and the children were glad that spring had come again."
217,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"The little helpers had done their work well, and were happy--and every"
218,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,one thanked God for the spring.

224,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
225,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Rock-a-by baby in the tree top, When the wind blows the cradle will"
226,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"rock."""
227,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
228,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Helena was playing with her dolls under the Maple tree in the garden. It
229,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"was the first warm day of spring, and the little girl was glad to be"
230,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"out of doors again, and to rock her babies to sleep on one of the low"
231,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,branches.
232,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
233,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,But she was not the only one singing a lullaby that bright sunny
234,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"morning, for Mother Nature was singing one, too, and a soft breeze was"
235,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,gently tucking some little brown cradles to and fro in the tree tops.
236,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Some were very, very small, and others were larger, but each held a"
237,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"wee leaf baby, fast asleep. The next time Helena came out to play, the"
238,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"babies in the treetop were waking up, and she could see them in their"
239,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"dainty green nightdresses, peeping out at the world. During the next"
240,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"week they grew a great deal, and one of them crept out of their cradles"
241,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"which fell down to the ground, leaving the babies still up in the tree"
242,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,top.
243,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
244,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"By the time Spring went away, the babies had grown large and strong, and"
245,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,spread beautiful green parasols to give shade to their friends through
246,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"the hot, dusty days of summer. When Autumn came, Mother Nature gave"
247,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"them a holiday, and how pretty they looked in their gay gowns as they"
248,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,frolicked with the wind!
249,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
250,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Then they said good-by to the Maple tree, and went dancing and whirling"
251,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,over the fields to meet King Winter. When Helena looked into their old
252,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"homes on the tree, she found some more tiny brown cradles, and knew that"
253,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,in them were new leaf babies that sleep safely til Spring comes again to
254,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"visit Earthdom, and wakes each ""baby in the tree top."""

260,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
261,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"I know a little maiden,"
262,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"She is very fair and sweet,"
263,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,As she trips among the grasses
264,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,That kiss her dainty feet;
265,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Her arms are full of flowers,"
266,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"The snow-drops, pure and white,"
267,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Timid blue-eyed violets,"
268,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,And daffodillies bright.
269,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
270,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"She loves dear Mother Nature,"
271,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,And wanders by her side;
272,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,She beckons to the birdlings
273,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,That flock from far and wide.
274,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"She wakes the baby brooklets,"
275,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Soft breezes hear her call;
276,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,She tells the little children
277,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,The sweetest tales of all.
278,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
279,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Her brow is sometimes clouded,"
280,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"And she sighs with gentle grace,"
281,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Till the sunbeams, daring lovers,"
282,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Kiss the teardrops from her face.
283,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Well we know this dainty maiden,"
284,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,For April is her name;
285,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"And we welcome her with gladness,"

291,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Mr. Frog's Story
292,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
293,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Down in the garden is a pretty brook, and something funny happened one"
294,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,day as I was sitting watching the tadpoles and minnows playing tag and
295,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,hide-and-go-seek. All at once something gave a jump out of the water and
296,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"with a loud ""kerchunk,"" landed on a stone near by. It was Mr. Frog, and"
297,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"as ""kerchunk"" in frog language means ""how do you do?"" I replied politely"
298,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,and inquired for his health.
299,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
300,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"He assured me that he was well and happy, and went on talking. ""Did you"
301,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,know that I was once a tadpole just like those little creatures in the
302,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,brook?
303,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
304,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""I have heard people say that you were,"" I answered. ""You would not"
305,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"believe it to look at me now, would you?"""
306,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
307,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""No,"" I said, for certainly he did not look at all like the queer little"
308,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,animals I was watching.
309,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
310,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Yes,"" he continued, ""once I was a tiny black egg in a globe of clear"
311,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"white jelly, and floated around along the bank of this same brook. Soon"
312,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"I grew into a wee tadpole, and freed myself from the globe of jelly,"
313,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,and found I could swim about. I had a long flat tail which I used as
314,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"a paddle to help me swim. I had no feet nor legs then, but I grew very"
315,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"fast, and soon two legs came out near my tail, and by and by two front"
316,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"ones came, and I did not need my tail any more, so it disappeared. Then"
317,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"I discovered that I had a long, slender tongue to catch insects with. My"
318,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"skin, too, had changed, and is now covered with beautiful spots, and if"
319,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,you look at my eyes you will see how bright they are.
320,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
321,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""I live beside this brook with my family, and my cousins, the toads;"
322,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,and in the spring and summer evenings we sing to our little tadpole
323,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"children, and tell them of the time when they, too, will grow up and be"
324,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"toads and frogs."""
325,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
326,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Here Mr. Frog paused, and before I could thank him for his interesting"
327,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"story, he gave a loud ""kadunk,"" which means ""good-by,"" and with a splash"
328,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,he was off for a swim in the brook.

337,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,they travelled very quickly. As they passed me I fancied I heard them
338,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"say, ""How do you do? We are glad to see you again. Are there plenty of"

347,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
348,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"""Thank you,"" they called, and hurried on, leaving me to wonder what"
349,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"sort of a journey they had. All day long I saw them flying to and fro,"
350,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,carrying loads of straw and mud.

352,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Just at twilight there came a rap at my window, and there stood Mr."

356,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
357,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Sure enough, there was a tiny home on Apple tree Avenue, just at the"
358,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"corner of Branch Alley. There was a cellar of mud, and the rest of the"

360,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
361,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"Of course I admired it, and asked him if he was all ready to go to"

364,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"to rest on."""
365,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,
366,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"I threw some out, and in a short time the nest was lined. Then Robin"

371,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,"heard some new notes, and, peeping out, saw that five little robins had"
372,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,come to brighten the cozy nest. Such a busy time as the papa and mamma
373,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,Redbreasts had now! Such a digging for worms to drop into the big mouths
374,BUTTERCUP GOLD AND OTHER STORIES,which seemed to be always asking for food! In a few weeks the baby birds

418,II.,The Lily Sisters
419,II.,
420,II.,"Once upon a time there were three little sisters dressed in green, who"
421,II.,lived together in a beautiful palace which was owned by a Great King.
422,II.,Such a beautiful palace as it was! The ceilings were made of turquoise
423,II.,"and opal, and soft, velvety green carpets covered the floors."
424,II.,
425,II.,"Many other children lived with these little sisters, and they had such"
426,II.,"a kind nurse called Dame Nature, who taught them how to do their work"
427,II.,well; for everybody had some work to do for the Great King.
428,II.,
429,II.,"Surely no one could be unhappy in such a wonderful home, and yet, I, am"
430,II.,"sorry to say, one of the little sisters was always discontented."
431,II.,
432,II.,"She knew, for Dame Nature had told her, that some day the Great King"
433,II.,"would come to see who had done loving work for him, and would give the"
434,II.,"good lilies beautiful white robes and golden crowns, but she was not"
435,II.,willing to wait until the King was ready and saw fit to do it.
436,II.,
437,II.,"When the Sunbeam children came to play, she would hang down her head and"
438,II.,"sulk, and after a while they would leave her alone, and play with her"
439,II.,sisters.
440,II.,
441,II.,"When Professor Rain's school was out, and the jolly little raindrops"
442,II.,"coaxed her to play with them, she would say crossly, ""You am too rough,"
443,II.,"let me alone!"" and they would go and play with the happy little sisters"
444,II.,as the sunbeams had done; for everybody loved the two good little lily
445,II.,"sisters, who were sorry to see how naughty the other lily was."
446,II.,
447,II.,"But they tried to do their best to help her, and kept on growing."
448,II.,
449,II.,"One day the Great King, who had seen how well they tried to do, thought"
450,II.,"they deserved their robes and crowns, so he sent the sunbeams dancing"
451,II.,away to awaken the inhabitants of the palace for the crowning.
452,II.,
453,II.,"Away they went, peeping through the curtains, and flying into the"
454,II.,windows of the palace and waking all the little children with kisses.
455,II.,
456,II.,"Then they took off the old green dresses of the sisters, and put pure"
457,II.,white robes on them and gave them crowns of pure gold. The other little
458,II.,"sister wished then that she had tried to do right, and drooped until she"
459,II.,faded away.
460,II.,
461,II.,Madam Wind and the Bird family gave a grand concert in Maple Tree Park.
462,II.,"Everything was full of gladness, and the lily sisters held a reception"
463,II.,"all day, and many people came to congratulate them upon being crowned."
464,II.,"Among their visitors was wee Ruth, who kissed them and took them to a"
465,II.,"little sick friend. He smiled as she pressed them into his hand, saying:"
466,II.,"""Take them, please, for Easter,"" and in her sweet child language she"
467,II.,"told the story of Easter, and of the wonderful work the Great King's Son"
468,II.,did for the people of the beautiful palace.

473,II.,Nature's Violet Children
474,II.,
475,II.,Once on a sunny hill in the woods grew a little colony of violets. They
476,II.,"had slept quietly through the long winter, tucked up snug and warm in"
477,II.,"the soft, white snow-blankets that King Winter had sent Mother Nature for"
478,II.,her flower babies. Jack Frost had gone pouting over the hills because
479,II.,"the little sunbeams would not play with him, and spoiled his fancy"
480,II.,pictures. The tiny raindrops knocked at the door of Mother Nature's
481,II.,"great, brown house; and the birds called to the flowers to wake up."
482,II.,
483,II.,"So the violets raised their strong, hardy leaves, lifted up their dainty"
484,II.,"heads, and were glad because spring had come. While they were so happy,"
485,II.,"a little girl came to the woods in search of wild flowers. ""How pretty"
486,II.,"those violets are,"" she said. ""I wish I could stay and watch the buds"
487,II.,"open, but I will take some of them with me and keep them in water, and"
488,II.,"they will remind me of this sunny hill, and perhaps they will blossom."""
489,II.,
490,II.,"Then the violets were frightened and whispered, ""Please don't take us!"""
491,II.,"But Ruth did not hear them, and she pulled stem after stem till her"
492,II.,small hands were quite filled. Then she said good-by to the pretty
493,II.,"place, and the little violets said good-by, too."
494,II.,
495,II.,"When Ruth got home, she put the buds into a vase of water, and set them"
496,II.,in an open window where they could see the blue sky and feel the kisses
497,II.,"of the sunbeams. But the poor little violets drooped for a time, they"
498,II.,"were so homesick, and whispered to each other, ""Let us give up and die!"""
499,II.,"A beautiful canary in a cage over their heads sang ""cheer up! chirrup!"""
500,II.,but they would not listen to him at first.
501,II.,
502,II.,"By and by they said, ""Why do you sing that to us? How can we be happy"
503,II.,"away from our beautiful home?"""
504,II.,
505,II.,"Still the bird sang ""cheer up! chirrup! The sun is smiling at you and I"
506,II.,am singing to you. We are trying to make you glad. How nice it would
507,II.,be if you would only blossom and make some one happy instead of hanging
508,II.,your heads and trying to die. Do you think I like to be shut up here? If
509,II.,"some one would leave the door of my cage open, I would spread my wings"
510,II.,"and fly out of the window, far away to the green woods and the blue sky."
511,II.,"But while I am here, I may as well sing and be glad. Cheer up! chirrup!"""
512,II.,
513,II.,"""Perhaps he is right,"" said the buds, and they lifted up their heads"
514,II.,and began to grow. One bright spring morning Mother Nature passed by the
515,II.,"window and gave them each a lovely violet cap. Then they were, glad, and"
516,II.,"Ruth was happy, too, because her buds had blossomed."
517,II.,
518,II.,"The cheery canary sang his sweetest carol to them, and the whole day was"
519,II.,bright because Mother Nature's little violet children had tried their
520,II.,"best to be happy and so had made others happy, too."
521,II.,
522,II.,"As the great red sun went down into the west, he heard the happy bird"
523,II.,"still singing ""cheer up! chirrup!"""

528,II.,Baby Caterpillar
529,II.,
530,II.,Baby Caterpillar was tired. All summer long she had been travelling
531,II.,"slowly through the green world where she lived, and feeding on the green"
532,II.,leaves that grew near her home. Now Autumn had come and Mother Nature
533,II.,"had given a holiday to the leaves, who put on their new dresses of red"
534,II.,and gold and played tag with the breezes. Baby Caterpillar wanted to
535,II.,"play, too, but could not run so fast as the happy little leaves, and she"
536,II.,grew very tired and thought she would take a nap. So she found a cozy
537,II.,"place among the branches of a grape vine, and made herself a soft, silky"
538,II.,"blanket. Then she rolled herself away within it, and then, in her queer"
539,II.,"little cradle, went to sleep."
540,II.,
541,II.,"One night, late in the fall, Jack Frost came over the hill. He spied the"
542,II.,"cradle swinging to and fro, and began to play roughly with it, for he is"
543,II.,"a roguish little fellow, and touches everything that comes in his way."
544,II.,But the warm blanket hid the little sleeper so that Jack could not find
545,II.,her.
546,II.,
547,II.,"By and by King Winter came, bringing beautiful snow blankets to Mother"
548,II.,"Nature's flower babies. He gently rocked the cradle as he passed, and"
549,II.,"whispered, ""Sleep, baby, sleep! You have no need of my blankets."""
550,II.,
551,II.,"At last Spring came with the sunbeams, the best and merriest of Mother"
552,II.,"Nature's helpers. They awoke the flowers from their long winter nap, and"
553,II.,called to the birds and the brooks to begin their songs. When they came
554,II.,"to the little brown cradle, they stopped to rest, and Baby Caterpillar"
555,II.,began to get very warm under the thick blanket. She woke up and
556,II.,"stretched herself, and her cradle broke, and she came out to greet the"
557,II.,Spring. But what a change! Instead of the old dingy dress that she
558,II.,"went to sleep in, she now had a beautiful yellow one; and, instead of"
559,II.,"crawling among the leaves, she flew up and away into the sweet spring"
560,II.,air to play with the sunbeams and flowers; and the little children
561,II.,called her a butterfly.

566,II.,Five Little Indian Brothers
567,II.,
568,II.,Once there were five little brothers living in Farmer Lane's barn. There
569,II.,"were a great many other children there, too, but these little brothers"
570,II.,"played by themselves, and chased each other across the wide floor of the"
571,II.,"barn until they reached a corner where there was a large crack, and then"
572,II.,they could look out into the world. The first thing they saw was Farmer
573,II.,"Lane breaking up the rich brown earth with his plough, for Spring"
574,II.,"had come, and told him it was time to do his planting, while the little"
575,II.,"brothers were watching him, and wishing they could find a way to roll"
576,II.,"out into the bright sunshine and help him, something happened. What do"
577,II.,you suppose it was?
578,II.,
579,II.,A great brown hand came up behind them and in a moment they found
580,II.,"themselves in a wooden measure with many more of their friends. ""What"
581,II.,"is the matter?"" said one little brother. ""I don't know,"" said another."
582,II.,"""Maybe we are going to travel,"" said a third; while the two smallest"
583,II.,"cuddled very closely together, and whispered, ""We won't be afraid; God"
584,II.,"will take care of us."""
585,II.,
586,II.,"The measure was taken, out into the field, where Farmer Lane was"
587,II.,"still at work, and soon, into the furrows made by the plow, the little"
588,II.,brothers were dropped one by one. They lay very still at first. It was
589,II.,"so strange and dark in their new home. By and by they found a friend, an"
590,II.,"earth-worm, who told them wonderful stories, how God would take care of"
591,II.,"them, and some day would give them a new life. Then the little brothers"
592,II.,were glad and hoped it would be soon. Thus the days went by. The warm
593,II.,"spring showers moistened the earth, and the sun shone so brightly that"
594,II.,the brothers danced for joy way down in their dark home. What do you
595,II.,"suppose happened when they danced? Why, their old coats split open, and"
596,II.,"some little hands came out. They were helpful hands, too, and went to"
597,II.,work at once. Some of them went down into the earth to find food and
598,II.,"water for the whole plants, and the others reached upward to the air and"
599,II.,"sunshine, and spread out beautiful, long green leaves."
600,II.,
601,II.,"Each day the plants grew taller and taller, and new buds came that"
602,II.,blossomed into flowery tassels that waved over the tops of the plants.
603,II.,"These tassels were fall of a golden dust called pollen, and as the wind"
604,II.,"blew it to and fro, some of the tiny grains found little green cradles"
605,II.,"along the sides of the plants, and crept into them. There they stayed,"
606,II.,"growing strong and round, until one midsummer day the plants were full"
607,II.,"of ripe, sweet ears of corn."
608,II.,
609,II.,"When were the five little brothers, do you ask? Why, they were five"
610,II.,little kernels of Indian corn that Farmer Lane planted one spring
611,II.,"morning, and each beautiful stalk of corn was the new life the"
612,II.,"earth-worm told them about. God had taken care of them, and takes care"
613,II.,"of of His little children, too."

618,II.,Buttercup Gold
619,II.,
620,II.,Did you ever hear of the pot of gold hidden at the end of the rainbow?
621,II.,"Some people think it is there now, but they are mistaken, for a long"
622,II.,"time ago somebody found it. How he happened to find it, nobody knows,"
623,II.,"for a great many people have searched in vain, and have never even been"
624,II.,able to discover that the rainbow has any ends at all. The man who found
625,II.,"it was very selfish and did not want anybody to know, for fear they"
626,II.,"might want some of his money. So one night he put it in a bag, which"
627,II.,"he slung over his shoulder, and walked across the fields toward a thick"
628,II.,wood where he meant to hide it.
629,II.,
630,II.,In the bag was something beside the gold--something so small that the
631,II.,"greedy man in his hurry had not noticed it. It was a hole, and, as he"
632,II.,"walked on, one by one the gold coins fell out into the grass. When he"
633,II.,"reached the wood and found all of his money gone, he hurried back to"
634,II.,"search for it, but something strange had happened. It was a midsummer"
635,II.,"night, and the fairies were having a dance out in the meadows. They were"
636,II.,"good, loving little people, and despised selfishness above everything."
637,II.,One little fairy spied the glittering gold among the grasses. She had
638,II.,"seen the greedy man passing by, and knew he would soon be back to hunt"
639,II.,"for his treasure. ""It will do him no good,"" she said, ""if he hides"
640,II.,"it away, and neither will it help anybody else. I will change it into"
641,II.,"something that will give joy to rich and poor."""
642,II.,
643,II.,"When the greedy man reached the meadow he could see no gold money,"
644,II.,"but in its place were bright, yellow flowers--buttercup gold for the"
645,II.,children.

650,II.,The Raindrops
651,II.,
652,II.,"Up above us, near the Sky Country, in a place called Cloudland, live a"
653,II.,"great many little people, called raindrops. They are very helpful,"
654,II.,"and always try to do their best, because they know the great King of"
655,II.,Cloudland has work for them all. One morning two tiny raindrops were
656,II.,"sitting together looking down at Earthdom. ""How dusty and hot everything"
657,II.,"looks,"" said one drop. ""Yes,"" replied the other, ""let us go down and"
658,II.,"see how much good we can do in Earthdom to-day."" So these two little"
659,II.,"raindrops called their brothers and sisters and told of their plan, and"
660,II.,"asked them to go, too, for they always wanted to share their good time"
661,II.,"with others. ""Let's have a game of tag, and see who will reach the top"
662,II.,"of that hill first,"" said one little drop, and away they scampered. They"
663,II.,"ran so fast that they reached Earthdom at about the same time, and how"
664,II.,glad Mother Nature was to see them. Some of them went at once to
665,II.,"visit the flowers, and whispered such sweet words to the tired, dusty"
666,II.,"blossoms, that they raised their heads again, and thanked the raindrops"
667,II.,for the comfort they had brought. Some of them slid down the slanting
668,II.,roofs of houses and filled the wells. Our two little raindrops with five
669,II.,"others, went down into the brown earth and cheered up the roots. Then"
670,II.,"they travelled on, and by and by they came out again further down the"
671,II.,"hill, and made a beautiful spring, around which little children"
672,II.,"played. The spring soon helped make a brook, that flowed down over the"
673,II.,"hillsides, winding in and out among the rocks, washing them smooth and"
674,II.,"round, singing as it rippled on its way."
675,II.,
676,II.,By and by it met some more brooks and they made a stream. The sunbeams
677,II.,"loved the clear stream and danced to and fro over its surface, as it"
678,II.,"rushed joyously onward, turning the busy mill wheels, and keeping the"
679,II.,grass and flowers alive and beautiful. Sometimes weary travellers walked
680,II.,"along its banks, and stooped and quenched their thirst with its pure,"
681,II.,"cool water. While the stream journeyed on, it met other streams and they"
682,II.,"made a rivulet, and by and by the rivulet heard a low voice calling,"
683,II.,"""Come with me and I will show you the mightiest of waters."" So the"
684,II.,"rivulet joined the river, and together they travelled on till they heard"
685,II.,the deep voice of the ocean welcoming them to its cave.
686,II.,
687,II.,Where were the little raindrops that left Cloudland early in the
688,II.,"morning? They were playing among the ocean waves, and helping to rock"
689,II.,the ships that sailed over the waters. At sunset a vapor-boat carried
690,II.,"the drops back home and in the eastern sky they stood with robes of red,"
691,II.,"orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, and made a bright bow"
692,II.,of promise.
693,II.,
694,II.,"As they looked down upon Earthdom once more, everything was fresh, and"
695,II.,"sweet, and glad, because the little raindrops had done so much to help"
696,II.,"others, and had left no part of their work undone. The night shadows"
697,II.,"came, and the rainbow faded slowly away, leaving a message for the"
698,II.,"children of Earthdom. ""Do your best, little children, and big children,"
699,II.,"too, for God has work for all."""

706,II.,"nine years old. So as soon as nap time came, and baby was at last quiet,"
707,II.,"Laura went out on the porch and cuddled down in the hammock, where she"
708,II.,"swung to and fro, wishing there was something nice to do, or some new"
709,II.,kinds of dolls to play with. All at once she thought she heard a
710,II.,"faint voice say, ""What a queer child! Here she is wishing for some new"
711,II.,"plaything, and has never noticed us. She must be blind, poor child! for"
712,II.,every morning we put on our prettiest dresses and smile at her; but she
713,II.,"always passes us by."""
714,II.,
715,II.,"""Yes,"" replied another voice, ""when she came out here to lie down in the"

719,II.,"Laura sat up, rubbed her eyes, and looked around in surprise. Had some"
720,II.,"one really spoken, or had she only fallen asleep and dreamed it all?"
721,II.,
722,II.,She could see nothing except the morning glories which covered the side
723,II.,"of the porch. There seemed to be hundreds of them, blue, white, pink,"
724,II.,"and violet; and how wide awake they looked! ""It must have been the"
725,II.,"'glories' talking,"" said Laura, ""but I didn't know glories could talk."
726,II.,"Can you, dear glories?"""
727,II.,
728,II.,"The flowers nodded, as if they understood what she said."
729,II.,
730,II.,"""What pretty colors! I never half noticed them before,"" went on Laura,"
731,II.,"""and wouldn't that blue one make a lovely dress?"""
732,II.,
733,II.,"Just then wee Donald, fresh from his nap, came toddling out through"
734,II.,"the open door, and stretched his little fat hands to the glories. ""Baby"
735,II.,"wants a trumpet,"" he cried."
736,II.,
737,II.,
738,II.,"Laura laughed aloud as she said: ""Why, they do look like trumpets, and"
739,II.,"like parasols, too;"" and she gathered a handful of the blossoms and"
740,II.,"sprinkled the porch with their brightness. ""Let's play with them, baby;"
741,II.,"see if we can make some dolls;"" and Laura stood a glory on the step,"
742,II.,"and into the tiny hole stuck the yellow center of a daisy, whose petals"
743,II.,"she had pulled out. On this center she marked eyes, nose, and mouth; and"
744,II.,"when a small glory was added for a bonnet, what a pretty flower doll"
745,II.,"she had, with a pink skirt, green waist, and white bonnet! Then a whole"
746,II.,"family of glories were made, and Laura gave them each a parasol to"
747,II.,carry.
748,II.,
749,II.,"Baby used his glories for tents, and they had a good time playing, and"
750,II.,Laura wished she had noticed the glories more before.
751,II.,
752,II.,"By and by, when the day was over, and Laura sat again in the hammock,"
753,II.,"watching the sleeping glories, she said: ""I wonder if the glories could"
754,II.,"have been talking this morning; ""and one little sleepy bud looked as if"
755,II.,it could tell if it chose. But Mamma put her arm about the little girl
756,II.,"and said, ""I think it was a dream, dear. But if the flowers could speak"
757,II.,"I think they would tell my darling that by using her eyes more, she will"
758,II.,"find out how much there is that is beautiful, and God made them all for"
759,II.,"us to enjoy, because he loves us. Every flower that blooms its sweetest,"
760,II.,"and every child who tries to be good, is a precious part of our Heavenly"
761,II.,"Father's glories."""

804,II.,"a happy little fellow, but is always up to some prank. If Father Winter"
805,II.,"does not send me some blankets soon, I fear Jack will pinch my babies'"
806,II.,"toes, and pull their ears, and make them shiver till they am ready to"

809,II.,
810,II.,"""Ha! ha! ha!"" laughed a tinkling voice right at the dear old lady's"
811,II.,"elbow. ""Some of your children did not mind you. Early this morning I"
812,II.,"found one of them whispering to a sunbeam, and under the hedge found"
813,II.,a tiny blue aster. I shook her till she was so cold she was glad to go
814,II.,"back to bed again. Ha! ha! ha!"" and Jack gave Mother Nature such a hug"
815,II.,"that she shivered, and murmured: ""Poor babies! I must write a letter to"
816,II.,"Father Winter."""
817,II.,
818,II.,This is what the letter said:
819,II.,
820,II.,"Earthdom, November 1, 1893."
821,II.,
822,II.,Dear Father Winter:--Have you any warm blankets for my babies? The
823,II.,"season is coming when they should take a long, long nap, and Jack is up"
824,II.,to his tricks again. Please send me some blankets soon.
825,II.,
826,II.,"From your old friend,"
827,II.,
828,II.,Mother Nature.
829,II.,
830,II.,This letter she directed to
831,II.,
832,II.,"King Winter, The Polar Regions, Cloud-dom."
833,II.,
834,II.,"Then she called her messenger, Autumn Wind, and sent him northward with"
835,II.,her message. King Winter was seated on his throne at the back of the
836,II.,"North Wind, planning his coming work in Earthdom, when Autumn Wind"
837,II.,arrived with the letter.
838,II.,
839,II.,"""Deary me! deary me!"" said the king, ""has Jack Frost gone to bother"
840,II.,Mother Nature? I meant he should wait for me this year. But something
841,II.,"must be done. Ho! Snowflake, come here, and bring your sisters and"
842,II.,"brothers with you."""
843,II.,
844,II.,In a few moments a troop of dainty beings clothed in white came dancing
845,II.,"along. ""What do you wish, Father Winter?"" they asked."
846,II.,
847,II.,"""Mother Nature has need of you, my helpers,"" replied the king. ""You"
848,II.,"must, stop the next passing cloud, and go down to Earthdom, and cover up"

850,II.,
851,II.,"Just then a golden-edged cloud floated by, and the snowflakes huddled"
852,II.,together on it and were soon travelling earthward. The sun was setting
853,II.,"as they passed the western gate of the city, and the cloud was tinged"
854,II.,"with red and gold. By and by it began to grow dark, and the little cloud"
855,II.,"grew larger and larger, and before long the night came. In the morning"
856,II.,the little children of Earthdom were surprised to see a white covering
857,II.,over the land.
858,II.,
859,II.,"""See the snow, the beautiful snow"" they cried; and the sleds were"
860,II.,"brought out, and such a merry time as they had playing in the white"

903,II.,The Christmas Star
904,II.,
905,II.,"Long, long ago, in the blue sky above the hills of Bethlehem, twinkled"
906,II.,the stars. Very early in the morning they would sing together and would
907,II.,tell each other of what they had seen during the long night.
908,II.,
909,II.,They used to watch the shepherds guarding their flocks upon the
910,II.,"hillsides, and one bright evening star that looked down upon the"
911,II.,"earth earlier than the others, would tell stories of little children"
912,II.,whispering their prayers at the twilight hour. One wintry night a new
913,II.,star came to visit the other stars. It was so radiant that its rays
914,II.,shone upon the gray hills and made them light as day. It had come on
915,II.,a wonderful errand. The shepherds saw it and were frightened at its
916,II.,"strange brightness; but an angel came to them and said: ""Do not be"
917,II.,"afraid; the star has come to bring you good, tidings of great joy, and"
918,II.,"to show you the place where a little babe is born,--a little babe whose"
919,II.,"name is Jesus, and who will give peace and joy to the whole world."""
920,II.,
921,II.,"Then the shepherds heard some singing,--beautiful singing, for a great"
922,II.,many angels had come to tell the good news; and the star grew larger and
923,II.,"brighter, it was so glad. When the angels had gone back to Heaven,"
924,II.,"the shepherds said, ""Let us go and see this child."" So they left their"
925,II.,"flocks sleeping on the hillsides, and took their crooks in their hands"
926,II.,"and followed the star, which travelled on and on till it led them to the"
927,II.,"little stable in Bethlehem, when the Baby Jesus was cradled in a manger."
928,II.,"Then the star moved on again to a country far away, where some good,"
929,II.,"wise men lived. They saw the bright light, and noticed the star moving"
930,II.,"on and on, as if it were showing them the way to go. So they, too,"
931,II.,followed the star till it rested above the birthplace of Jesus. Then the
932,II.,"wise men went in and gave their best gifts to the baby, and they and the"
933,II.,shepherds knelt and thanked God for sending the little Christ Child to
934,II.,be the best Christmas present the great world ever had. The star watched
935,II.,"over them, casting a peaceful light over all. At last the dawn came over"
936,II.,"the hill tops, and the star went away, far back into the blue heavens,"
937,II.,to tell the other stars the story of our first glad Christmas day.
