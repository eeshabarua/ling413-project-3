63,EXPLANATORY.,
64,EXPLANATORY.,I must say a few words in explanation of the somewhat novel form which
65,EXPLANATORY.,"my new ""Bee-Book"" has taken, and which, doubtless, will be a surprise to"
66,EXPLANATORY.,the many Bee-Friends who are waiting with exemplary patience for the
67,EXPLANATORY.,"second edition of my original ""Bee-Book,"" soon about to appear after an"
68,EXPLANATORY.,interval of thirty years from the publication of the first edition.
69,EXPLANATORY.,
70,EXPLANATORY.,"I happened last year to be at the Cologne Station, waiting for the"
71,EXPLANATORY.,"train, and employed my spare time in looking over the book stall for"
72,EXPLANATORY.,something to read on my way to Aix-la-Chapelle. The stall was covered
73,EXPLANATORY.,with books about the late War. I had returned from a visit to the Battle
74,EXPLANATORY.,"Fields of 1870, and was sick of the subject. I wanted something of a"
75,EXPLANATORY.,"more peaceful nature, and I was turning away, without making a purchase,"
76,EXPLANATORY.,when a book met my eye entitled _Schnurrdiburr_. What that might mean I
77,EXPLANATORY.,"knew not, but the second title, _oder die Bienen_, was intelligible, and"
78,EXPLANATORY.,"had attraction enough for me. I opened it, and saw it was profusely"
79,EXPLANATORY.,illustrated with very comical cuts. I paid my Thaler and carried away my
80,EXPLANATORY.,prize.
81,EXPLANATORY.,
82,EXPLANATORY.,The cuts are reproduced in the book which my readers have in their
83,EXPLANATORY.,hands. The verses were written up to the pictures rather than translated
84,EXPLANATORY.,from the German text; for alas! my German is very limited; enough for
85,EXPLANATORY.,"travelling purposes, but hardly enough to enable me to read a Bee-Book"
86,EXPLANATORY.,either serious or comical.

91,RIDENTEM DICERE VERUM QUID VETAT?,There is much truth lying hid under these comical stories; still more in
92,RIDENTEM DICERE VERUM QUID VETAT?,the illustrations; and the notes which I have appended may be found
93,RIDENTEM DICERE VERUM QUID VETAT?,useful even by serious Bee-Masters.

182,W. C. C.,"All day, in regal state, the Queen"
183,W. C. C.,Encircled by her court is seen;

251,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
252,W. C. C.,
253,W. C. C.,Once on a time it so fell out
254,W. C. C.,He in the garden roamed about:
255,W. C. C.,He chanced to have an itching mood;

258,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
259,W. C. C.,
260,W. C. C.,"His hide he scratched; the bees rushed out,"

276,W. C. C.,
277,W. C. C.,It chanced a pig-jobber that way

280,W. C. C.,"""Just ten pounds ten, for he is big""--"
281,W. C. C.,"""Done""--""done again""--the bargain's struck--"
282,W. C. C.,"John Dull he found himself in luck,"

306,W. C. C.,"The air is clear the day is warm,"
307,W. C. C.,John Dull sits watching for a swarm;
308,W. C. C.,What's this? he thought; while I've been talking
309,W. C. C.,"My bees are all prepared for walking,"
310,W. C. C.,"Staves in their hands, and on his back"

358,W. C. C.,"""Nothing like soup,"" is still the cry"
359,W. C. C.,In each well ordered family;
360,W. C. C.,So on Christine the duty fell
361,W. C. C.,To cull the herbs they love so well;
362,W. C. C.,"And every morn, the charming maid"
363,W. C. C.,"Within her father's garden strayed,"
364,W. C. C.,"Parsley to pluck, wherewith to make"
365,W. C. C.,"The soup, which they at noon should take."

368,W. C. C.,
369,W. C. C.,"Her father's garden marched, I ween,"
370,W. C. C.,With that of Mr. Richard Dean;
371,W. C. C.,"A school-master by trade was he,"
372,W. C. C.,And she esteemed him--maidenly.
373,W. C. C.,"But by degrees, within her soul"
374,W. C. C.,"A softer, tenderer passion stole;"
375,W. C. C.,"Love--full of joy and full of sorrow,"
376,W. C. C.,"Sunshine to day, and storm to-morrow,--"
377,W. C. C.,"Love may forget a parsley bed,"
378,W. C. C.,And dream of golden flowers instead.
379,W. C. C.,
380,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
381,W. C. C.,
382,W. C. C.,And so the maiden stooped to cull a
383,W. C. C.,"Crocus, and an auricula."
384,W. C. C.,"These flowers, together-bound, she placed"
385,W. C. C.,Just half a foot above her waist.

387,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
388,W. C. C.,
389,W. C. C.,"Then sat her down beneath the shade,"
390,W. C. C.,And thought about him--happy maid.
391,W. C. C.,
392,W. C. C.,"Now Mr. Dull a nephew had,"
393,W. C. C.,"A most audacious, awkward lad;"
394,W. C. C.,Some fifteen summers he had seen
395,W. C. C.,"And still was very, very green."
396,W. C. C.,
397,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
398,W. C. C.,
399,W. C. C.,"Christine he eyed, and with desire"
400,W. C. C.,He felt his little soul on fire.
401,W. C. C.,With cat like pace behind the wall
402,W. C. C.,He crept (he was not near as tall.)
403,W. C. C.,
404,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
405,W. C. C.,
406,W. C. C.,"Leapt up, and from the affrighted Miss"

409,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
410,W. C. C.,
411,W. C. C.,"""Stop little monster"", and a whack"
412,W. C. C.,Descended on his upturned back--
413,W. C. C.,(The place I cannot more define
414,W. C. C.,Within the limits of a line)
415,W. C. C.,"--Side, I should add, but wherefore tell"
416,W. C. C.,What every school-boy knows so well.
417,W. C. C.,Dick Dean so roundly plied the stick
418,W. C. C.,That rogue Eugene skedaddled quick.
419,W. C. C.,
420,W. C. C.,[Illustration]
421,W. C. C.,
422,W. C. C.,"Then Richard raised the fainting maid,"
423,W. C. C.,And many a tender thing he said;
424,W. C. C.,"Her chin he chucked, his arm he placed"
425,W. C. C.,About her little taper waist;

427,W. C. C.,[Illustration]

433,W. C. C.,
434,W. C. C.,"But blushed assent; the flowers he took,"
