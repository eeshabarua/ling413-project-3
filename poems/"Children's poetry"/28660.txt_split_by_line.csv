130,PART I.,"Where are your berries, child?"
131,PART I.,"You cannot, sure, have sold them all,"
132,PART I.,"You had a basket pil'd."""
133,PART I.,
134,PART I.,"""No, mother, as I climb'd the fence,"
135,PART I.,"The nearest way to town,"
136,PART I.,"My apron caught upon a stake,"
137,PART I.,And so I tumbled down.
138,PART I.,
139,PART I.,"""I scratched my arm, and tore my hair,"
140,PART I.,But still did not complain;
141,PART I.,"And had my blackberries been safe,"
142,PART I.,Should not have cared a grain.
143,PART I.,
144,PART I.,[Illustration: Phebe and her Mother.]
145,PART I.,
146,PART I.,"""But when I saw them on the ground"
147,PART I.,"All scattered by my side,"
148,PART I.,"I pick'd my empty basket up,"
149,PART I.,And down I sat and cried.
150,PART I.,
151,PART I.,"""Just then a pretty little Miss"
152,PART I.,Chanced to be walking by;
153,PART I.,"She stopp'd, and looking pitiful,"
154,PART I.,She begg'd me not to cry.
155,PART I.,
156,PART I.,"""'Poor little girl, you fell,' said she,"
157,PART I.,'And must be sadly hurt'--
158,PART I.,"'O, no,' I cried, 'but see my fruit,"
159,PART I.,All mixed with sand and dirt!'
160,PART I.,
161,PART I.,"""'Well, do not grieve for that,' she said"
162,PART I.,"'Go home, and get some more:'"
163,PART I.,"Ah, no, for I have stripp'd the vines,"
164,PART I.,These were the last they bore.
165,PART I.,
166,PART I.,"""My father, Miss, is very poor,"
167,PART I.,And works in yonder stall;
168,PART I.,"He has so many little ones,"
169,PART I.,He cannot clothe us all.
170,PART I.,
171,PART I.,"""I always long'd to go to church,"
172,PART I.,But never could I go;
173,PART I.,"For when I ask'd him for a gown,"
174,PART I.,"He always answer'd, 'No.'"
175,PART I.,
176,PART I.,"""'There's not a father in the world"
177,PART I.,That loves his children more;
178,PART I.,"I'd get you one with all my heart,"

180,PART I.,
181,PART I.,"""But when the blackberries were ripe"
182,PART I.,"He said to me one day,"
183,PART I.,"'Phebe, if you will take the time"
184,PART I.,"That's given you for play,"
185,PART I.,
186,PART I.,"""'And gather blackberries enough,--"
187,PART I.,"And carry them to town,--"
188,PART I.,"To buy your bonnet and your shoes,"
189,PART I.,I'll try to get a gown.'
190,PART I.,
191,PART I.,[Illustration: Phebe and Billy going to School.]
192,PART I.,
193,PART I.,"""O Miss, I fairly jumped for joy,"
194,PART I.,My spirits were so light:
195,PART I.,"And so, when I had leave to play,"
196,PART I.,I pick'd with all my might.
197,PART I.,
198,PART I.,"""I sold enough to get my shoes,"
199,PART I.,About a week ago;
200,PART I.,"And these, if they had not been spilt,"
201,PART I.,Would buy a bonnet too.
202,PART I.,
203,PART I.,"""But now they are gone, they all are gone"
204,PART I.,"And I can get no more,"
205,PART I.,And Sundays I must stay at home
206,PART I.,Just as I did before.
207,PART I.,
208,PART I.,"""And, mother, then I cried again,"
209,PART I.,As hard as I could cry;
210,PART I.,"And, looking up, I saw a tear"
211,PART I.,Was standing in her eye.
212,PART I.,
213,PART I.,"""She caught her bonnet from her head--"
214,PART I.,"'Here, here,' she cried, 'take this!'"
215,PART I.,"O, no, indeed--I fear your 'ma"
216,PART I.,Would be offended Miss.
217,PART I.,
218,PART I.,[Illustration]
219,PART I.,
220,PART I.,"""'My 'ma! no, never! she delights"
221,PART I.,All sorrow to beguile;
222,PART I.,"And 'tis the sweetest joy she feels,"
223,PART I.,To make the wretched smile.
224,PART I.,
225,PART I.,"""'She taught me when I had enough,"
226,PART I.,To share it with the poor:
227,PART I.,And never let a needy child
228,PART I.,Go empty from the door.
229,PART I.,
230,PART I.,[Illustration: The Church the Blackberry Girl went to.]
231,PART I.,
232,PART I.,"""'So take it, for you need not fear"
233,PART I.,"Offending her, you see;"
234,PART I.,"I have another, too, at home,"
235,PART I.,And one's enough for me.'
236,PART I.,
237,PART I.,"""So then I took it,--here it is--"
238,PART I.,For pray what could I do?
239,PART I.,"And, mother, I shall love that Miss"

256,PART II.,They're very large and fully ripe;
257,PART II.,"Do look at them, and taste them pray."""
258,PART II.,
259,PART II.,"""O yes: they're very nice, indeed."
260,PART II.,Here's fourpence--that will buy a few:
261,PART II.,Not quite so many as I want--
262,PART II.,"However, I must make it do."""
263,PART II.,
264,PART II.,"""Nay, Miss, but you must take the whole;"""
265,PART II.,"""I can't, indeed, my money's spent;"
266,PART II.,"I should be glad to buy them all,"
267,PART II.,"But I have not another cent."""
268,PART II.,

276,PART II.,Perhaps you have--but ever will
277,PART II.,That little girl remember you.
278,PART II.,
279,PART II.,"""And ever since, I've been to church,"
280,PART II.,For much do I delight to go;
281,PART II.,And there I learn that works of love
282,PART II.,Are what all children ought to do.
283,PART II.,
284,PART II.,"""So then I thought within myself,"
285,PART II.,"That pretty basket, Billy wove,"
286,PART II.,"I'll fill with fruit for that dear Miss,"
287,PART II.,For sure 'twill be a work of love.
288,PART II.,
289,PART II.,"""And so one morning up I rose,"
290,PART II.,While yet the fields were wet with dew
291,PART II.,"And pick'd the nicest I could find,"
292,PART II.,"And brought them, fresh and sweet, for you."
293,PART II.,
294,PART II.,"""I know the gift is small indeed,"
295,PART II.,For such a lady to receive;
296,PART II.,But still I hope you'll not refuse
297,PART II.,"All that poor Phebe has to give."""

380,THE PET LAMB.,"I heard a voice: it said, Drink, pretty creature, drink!"
381,THE PET LAMB.,"And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied"
382,THE PET LAMB.,A snow-white mountain Lamb with a maiden at its side.
383,THE PET LAMB.,
384,THE PET LAMB.,"No other sheep were near; the Lamb was all alone,"
385,THE PET LAMB.,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;
386,THE PET LAMB.,"With one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel,"
387,THE PET LAMB.,While to that mountain Lamb she gave its evening meal.
388,THE PET LAMB.,
389,THE PET LAMB.,"The Lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,"
390,THE PET LAMB.,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with
391,THE PET LAMB.,pleasure shook.
392,THE PET LAMB.,"Drink, pretty creature, drink, she said in such a tone"

395,THE PET LAMB.,"'Twas little Barbara Lethwaite, a child of beauty rare!"
396,THE PET LAMB.,"I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair:"

398,THE PET LAMB.,But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.
399,THE PET LAMB.,
400,THE PET LAMB.,Towards the Lamb she looked; and from that shady place
401,THE PET LAMB.,I unobserved could see the workings of her face;
402,THE PET LAMB.,"If nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,"
403,THE PET LAMB.,"Thus, thought I, to her Lamb that little maid might sing!"
404,THE PET LAMB.,
405,THE PET LAMB.,"What ails thee, young one? what? why pull so at thy cord?"
406,THE PET LAMB.,Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?

408,THE PET LAMB.,"Rest, little young one, rest; what is't that aileth thee?"
409,THE PET LAMB.,
410,THE PET LAMB.,What is it thou wouldst seek? what is wanting to thy heart?
411,THE PET LAMB.,Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:
412,THE PET LAMB.,This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;
413,THE PET LAMB.,And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!
414,THE PET LAMB.,
415,THE PET LAMB.,"If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain;"
416,THE PET LAMB.,"This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain!"
417,THE PET LAMB.,"For rain and mountain storms, the like thou need'st not fear;"
418,THE PET LAMB.,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.
419,THE PET LAMB.,
420,THE PET LAMB.,"Rest little young one, rest; thou hast forgot the day"
421,THE PET LAMB.,When my father found thee first in places far away;
422,THE PET LAMB.,"Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,"

429,THE PET LAMB.,A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean
430,THE PET LAMB.,Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been.
431,THE PET LAMB.,
432,THE PET LAMB.,Thou knowest that twice a day I brought thee in this can

434,THE PET LAMB.,"And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,"
435,THE PET LAMB.,"I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new."

437,THE PET LAMB.,Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now;

882,CASABIANCA.,Whence all but him had fled!
883,CASABIANCA.,"The flame that lit the battle's wreck,"
884,CASABIANCA.,Shone round him o'er the dead.
885,CASABIANCA.,
886,CASABIANCA.,"Yet beautiful and bright he stood,"
887,CASABIANCA.,As born to rule the storm;
888,CASABIANCA.,"A creature of heroic blood,"
889,CASABIANCA.,A proud though childlike form.
890,CASABIANCA.,
891,CASABIANCA.,"The flames rolled on--he would not go,"
892,CASABIANCA.,Without his father's word;
893,CASABIANCA.,"That father, faint in death below,"
894,CASABIANCA.,His voice no longer heard.
895,CASABIANCA.,
896,CASABIANCA.,"He called aloud--Say, father, say"
897,CASABIANCA.,If yet my task is done?
898,CASABIANCA.,He knew not that the chieftain lay
899,CASABIANCA.,Unconscious of his son.
900,CASABIANCA.,
901,CASABIANCA.,"Speak, father! once again he cried,"
902,CASABIANCA.,If I may yet be gone;
903,CASABIANCA.,"And but the booming shots replied,"
904,CASABIANCA.,And fast the flames rolled on.
905,CASABIANCA.,
906,CASABIANCA.,"Upon his brow he felt their breath,"
907,CASABIANCA.,And in his waving hair;
908,CASABIANCA.,And looked from that lone post of death
909,CASABIANCA.,"In still, yet brave despair,"
910,CASABIANCA.,
911,CASABIANCA.,"And shouted but once more aloud,"
912,CASABIANCA.,My father! must I stay!
913,CASABIANCA.,"While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud,"
914,CASABIANCA.,The wreathing fires made way.
915,CASABIANCA.,
916,CASABIANCA.,"They wrapt the ship in splendor wild,"
917,CASABIANCA.,"They caught the flag on high,"
918,CASABIANCA.,"And streamed above the gallant child,"
919,CASABIANCA.,Like banners in the sky.
920,CASABIANCA.,
921,CASABIANCA.,There came a burst of thunder sound:
922,CASABIANCA.,"The boy--O, where was he?"
923,CASABIANCA.,"Ask of the winds, that far around"
924,CASABIANCA.,With fragments strewed the sea--
925,CASABIANCA.,
926,CASABIANCA.,"With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,"
927,CASABIANCA.,That well had borne their part;
928,CASABIANCA.,But the noblest thing that perished there
929,CASABIANCA.,Was that young faithful heart.

946,CASABIANCA.,"Twinkle, twinkle, little star;"
947,CASABIANCA.,How I wonder what you are!
948,CASABIANCA.,"Up above the world so high,"
949,CASABIANCA.,Like a diamond in the sky.
950,CASABIANCA.,
951,CASABIANCA.,"When the blazing sun is gone,"
952,CASABIANCA.,"When he nothing shines upon,"
953,CASABIANCA.,Then you show your little light
954,CASABIANCA.,"Twinkle, twinkle, all the night."
955,CASABIANCA.,
956,CASABIANCA.,Then the traveller in the dark
957,CASABIANCA.,Thanks you for your tiny spark!
958,CASABIANCA.,"He could not see which way to go,"
959,CASABIANCA.,If you did not twinkle so.
960,CASABIANCA.,
961,CASABIANCA.,"In the dark blue sky you keep,"
962,CASABIANCA.,And often through my curtains peep
963,CASABIANCA.,For you never shut your eye
964,CASABIANCA.,Till the sun is in the sky.
965,CASABIANCA.,
966,CASABIANCA.,As your bright and tiny spark
967,CASABIANCA.,"Lights the traveller in the dark,"
968,CASABIANCA.,"Though I know not what you are,"
969,CASABIANCA.,"Twinkle, twinkle, little star."
