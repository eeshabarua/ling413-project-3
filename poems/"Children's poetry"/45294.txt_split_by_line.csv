44,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,"We have, so sweet it like a star doth glisten,"
45,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
46,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,And dance along.
47,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
48,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,Now wake and hark: all brightly it is glowing
49,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
50,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,"With yule flames merry,"
51,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
52,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,And o'er it many a holly sprig is growing;
53,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
54,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,And scarlet berry.
55,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
56,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,"A bough of evergreen, with wax-lights gleaming,"
57,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
58,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,It bravely graces;
59,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
60,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,And o'er its lines the star that's eastward beaming
61,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
62,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,Leaves golden traces.
63,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
64,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,"Also, our little song; it sweetly praiseth,"
65,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
66,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,Like birds in flocks
67,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
68,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,When morning from her bed of roses raiseth
69,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
70,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,Her golden locks.
71,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
72,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,"But this it is that makes most sweet our story,"
73,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
74,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,When all is said:
75,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
76,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,It holds a little Child with rays of glory
77,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,
78,CHRISTMAS CAROLS.,Around His head._

179,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
180,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,|THE light was low in the school-room;
181,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
182,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,The day before Christmas day
183,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
184,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Had ended. It was darkening in the garden
185,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
186,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Where the Silent Children play.

207,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
208,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
209,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,

211,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
212,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"And their wonderful, watchful eyes--"
213,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
214,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,What dumb joy he would bring them
215,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
216,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,For the Christmas eve's surprise!
217,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
218,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
219,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
220,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,The lights blazed out in the school-room
221,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
222,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,The play-ground went dark as death;
223,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
224,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,The master moved in a halo;
225,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
226,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,The children held their breath:
227,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
228,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
229,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
230,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"""I show you now a wonder--"
231,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,

237,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
238,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
239,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
240,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"And answering spake the children,"
241,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
242,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,As the dead might answer too:
243,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
244,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"""But what for us, O master?"
245,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
246,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,This may be good for you;

248,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
249,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
250,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"""But how is our Christmas coming"
251,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
252,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Out of a wise machine?
253,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
254,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,For not like other children's
255,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
256,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Have our happy hours been;
257,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
258,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
259,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,

273,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
274,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"Across the school-room bent,"
275,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
276,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"O my children, for a little,"
277,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
278,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,As those who suffer must!
279,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
280,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"Great 'tis to bear denial,"
281,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
282,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"But grand it is to trust."""

287,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
288,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"Of twice three thousand years,"
289,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
290,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Gave her late salutation

301,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
302,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,"Their voices, wild and piercing,"
303,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
304,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Broke like a long desire
305,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
306,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
307,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
308,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,That to content has strengthened.
309,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,
310,THE SILENT CHILDREN.,Glad the clear strains outrang:

2550,A BABY SHOW.,well
2551,A BABY SHOW.,
2552,A BABY SHOW.,"You'll guess that I heard it as many a man hears,"

2565,A BABY SHOW.,
2566,A BABY SHOW.,They had drawn her this morning where daisies

2571,A BABY SHOW.,

2584,A BABY SHOW.,"In a dainty straw wagon with wheels of bright red,"
2585,A BABY SHOW.,
2586,A BABY SHOW.,And a top of white muslin which shaded her head.
2587,A BABY SHOW.,
2588,A BABY SHOW.,She was only one year and a few months old;
2589,A BABY SHOW.,
2590,A BABY SHOW.,Her eyes were bright blue and her hair was like

2593,A BABY SHOW.,

2598,A BABY SHOW.,And were laughing to watch her fat little hands
2599,A BABY SHOW.,
2600,A BABY SHOW.,Untwisting and twisting the stems and the strands.
2601,A BABY SHOW.,
2602,A BABY SHOW.,"Just then, of a sudden, a lark flew by"

2625,A BABY SHOW.,
2626,A BABY SHOW.,"As soon as they called him, and perched on a tree,"
2627,A BABY SHOW.,
2628,A BABY SHOW.,"And winked with his eye at the children and me,"
2629,A BABY SHOW.,
2630,A BABY SHOW.,"And laughed out, as much as a bird ever can,"
2631,A BABY SHOW.,
2632,A BABY SHOW.,"As he cried, ""Ha! ha! Little woman and man!"
2633,A BABY SHOW.,
2634,A BABY SHOW.,
2635,A BABY SHOW.,
2636,A BABY SHOW.,"""You'll be quite surprised and astonished, maybe,"
2637,A BABY SHOW.,
2638,A BABY SHOW.,To hear that I do not think much of your baby.
2639,A BABY SHOW.,
2640,A BABY SHOW.,"Why, out in the field here I've got in my nest,"
2641,A BABY SHOW.,
2642,A BABY SHOW.,"All cuddled up snug 'neath my wife's warm breast,"
2643,A BABY SHOW.,
2644,A BABY SHOW.,"Four little babies--two sisters, two brothers--"

2649,A BABY SHOW.,
2650,A BABY SHOW.,"Your baby's at least ten times older than they,"

2652,A BABY SHOW.,But they are all ready to fly to-day;
2653,A BABY SHOW.,
2654,A BABY SHOW.,
2655,A BABY SHOW.,
2656,A BABY SHOW.,"""They'll take care of themselves in another week,"
2657,A BABY SHOW.,
2658,A BABY SHOW.,Before your poor baby can walk or can speak.
2659,A BABY SHOW.,
2660,A BABY SHOW.,It has often surprised me to see what poor things
2661,A BABY SHOW.,
2662,A BABY SHOW.,All babies are that are born without wings;
2663,A BABY SHOW.,
2664,A BABY SHOW.,"And but one at a time! Dear me, my wife"
2665,A BABY SHOW.,
2666,A BABY SHOW.,"Would be quite ashamed of so idle a life!"""
2667,A BABY SHOW.,
2668,A BABY SHOW.,And the lark looked as scornful as a lark knows
2669,A BABY SHOW.,
2670,A BABY SHOW.,"how,"
2671,A BABY SHOW.,
2672,A BABY SHOW.,As he swung up and down on a slender bough.
2673,A BABY SHOW.,
2674,A BABY SHOW.,
2675,A BABY SHOW.,
2676,A BABY SHOW.,"A cat had been eying him there for a while,"
2677,A BABY SHOW.,
2678,A BABY SHOW.,And sprang at him now from top of a stile.
2679,A BABY SHOW.,
2680,A BABY SHOW.,But she missed her aim--he was quite too high;
2681,A BABY SHOW.,
2682,A BABY SHOW.,"And oh, how he laughed as he soared in the sky!"
2683,A BABY SHOW.,
2684,A BABY SHOW.,"Then the cat scrambled up, disappointed and cross;"
2685,A BABY SHOW.,
2686,A BABY SHOW.,"She looked all about her, and felt at a loss"
2687,A BABY SHOW.,
2688,A BABY SHOW.,What next she should do. So she took up the
2689,A BABY SHOW.,
2690,A BABY SHOW.,thread
2691,A BABY SHOW.,
2692,A BABY SHOW.,"Of the lark's discourse, and ill-naturedly said:"
