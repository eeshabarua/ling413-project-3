161,MOUNT CARMEL.,MOUNT CARMEL.
162,MOUNT CARMEL.,
163,MOUNT CARMEL.,"A great many turtle-doves lived about Mount Carmel, and there were"
164,MOUNT CARMEL.,"orange-trees and cypresses there, and among these the doves lived all"
165,MOUNT CARMEL.,"the winter. They had broods early in the year, and towards the end of"
166,MOUNT CARMEL.,"March, or the beginning of April, they set off like great gentlefolks,"
167,MOUNT CARMEL.,"to spend ""the season"" near London. All last winter a young English"
168,MOUNT CARMEL.,"musician, who was very pale and thin, lived with the monks in the"
169,MOUNT CARMEL.,monastery on Mount Carmel. He went to Syria because when a child he had
170,MOUNT CARMEL.,loved so to hear his mother read in the Bible about Elijah and Elisha on
171,MOUNT CARMEL.,"Mount Carmel. And he used to think then that if ever he was rich, he"
172,MOUNT CARMEL.,would go and see all the wonderful places mentioned in the Bible.
173,MOUNT CARMEL.,
174,MOUNT CARMEL.,"But he never was rich, and yet he came here. He was very pale, and had"
175,MOUNT CARMEL.,large and beautiful but sorrowful eyes. He took a violin with him to
176,MOUNT CARMEL.,"Mount Carmel; it was the greatest treasure he had on earth, and he"
177,MOUNT CARMEL.,"played the most wonderful things on this violin that ever were heard,"
178,MOUNT CARMEL.,and everybody who heard it said that he was a great musician. In the
179,MOUNT CARMEL.,winters he suffered very much from the cold and the fogs of England;
180,MOUNT CARMEL.,"so, last summer he saved a little money, and set off with his violin for"
181,MOUNT CARMEL.,"Syria, and all last winter he lived in the monastery of Mount Carmel,"
182,MOUNT CARMEL.,among the grave old monks.
183,MOUNT CARMEL.,
184,MOUNT CARMEL.,"There was one little old monk, a very old man, who soon grew very fond"
185,MOUNT CARMEL.,"of him; he too had been a musician, but he was now almost childish, and"
186,MOUNT CARMEL.,had forgotten how to play; and the brother monks had taken from him his
187,MOUNT CARMEL.,"old violin, because they said he made such a noise with it. He cried to"
188,MOUNT CARMEL.,"part with it, like a child, poor old man!"
189,MOUNT CARMEL.,
190,MOUNT CARMEL.,"The young musician had a little chamber in the monastery, which"
191,MOUNT CARMEL.,overlooked the sea; nobody can think what a beautiful view it had. The
192,MOUNT CARMEL.,"sun shone in so warm and pleasant, and a little group of cypresses grew"
193,MOUNT CARMEL.,just below the window.
194,MOUNT CARMEL.,
195,MOUNT CARMEL.,[Illustration]
196,MOUNT CARMEL.,
197,MOUNT CARMEL.,"The young man often and often stood at the window, and looked out upon"
198,MOUNT CARMEL.,"the sea, and down into the cypress-trees, among the thick branches of"
199,MOUNT CARMEL.,"which he heard the doves cooing. He loved to hear them coo, and so did"
200,MOUNT CARMEL.,the little old monk. One day early in January he saw that the
201,MOUNT CARMEL.,turtle-doves had built a nest just in sight; he watched the birds taking
202,MOUNT CARMEL.,"it by turns to sit on the eggs, and his heart was full of love to them;"
203,MOUNT CARMEL.,"they turned up their gentle eyes to him, but they never flew away, for"
204,MOUNT CARMEL.,"they saw in his mild and sorrowful countenance, that he would not hurt"
205,MOUNT CARMEL.,them.
206,MOUNT CARMEL.,
207,MOUNT CARMEL.,Beautiful and melancholy music sounded for half of the day down from his
208,MOUNT CARMEL.,"window to where the birds sat; it had a strange charm for the doves,"
209,MOUNT CARMEL.,they thought it was some new kind of nightingale come down from heaven.
210,MOUNT CARMEL.,"The little old monk sat in his Carmelite frock, with his hands laid"
211,MOUNT CARMEL.,"together on his knees and his head down on his breast, and listened with"
212,MOUNT CARMEL.,"his whole soul; to him too it came as a voice from heaven, and seemed to"
213,MOUNT CARMEL.,"call him away to a better land; great tears often fell from his eyes,"
214,MOUNT CARMEL.,"but they were not sorrowful tears, they were tears of love, tears which"
215,MOUNT CARMEL.,were called forth by a feeling of some great happiness which was coming
216,MOUNT CARMEL.,"for him, but which he could not rightly understand. He was, as you know,"
217,MOUNT CARMEL.,"a very old man, the oldest in all the monastery."

229,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
230,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,Heavenly music from the young man's room was heard every day;--finer and
231,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"finer it sounded. As early spring came on, he grew very poorly; the"
232,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"little old monk used to bring him his meals into his chamber, because it"
233,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,tired him to go up and down the long stone staircase to the great
234,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,eating-room. There never was anybody so kind as the little old monk.
235,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
236,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"A pair of young doves were hatched in the nest, and when the sun shone"
237,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"in at the window, the young man used to sit in his dressing-gown, with a"
238,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"pillow in his chair, and look down into the cypress-tree where the"
239,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"turtle-doves' nest was; he would sit for hours and look at them, and"
240,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,many beautiful thoughts passed through his mind as he did so. Never had
241,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,his heart been so full of love as now. The little old monk used to sit
242,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"on a low seat before him, waiting for the time when he asked for his"
243,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"violin, which was a great happiness for them both. The musician loved"
244,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"the old monk very much, and often, when he played, he desired to pour"
245,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,bright and comfortable thoughts into his innocent soul.
246,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
247,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,It was the end of March; the turtle-doves were all preparing for their
248,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,flight to England; the pair that had built their nest under the
249,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"musician's window had a home in some quiet woods in Surrey, where it"
250,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"was delightfully mild and pleasant even in winter, but they never were"
251,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"there in winter, although the wood had the name of Winterdown. It was a"
252,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"lovely wood: broad-leaved arums and primroses, and violets blue and"
253,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"white, covered the ground in spring, and in summer there were hundreds"
254,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"and hundreds of glow-worms, and the old tree-trunks were wreathed with"
255,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"ivy and honeysuckle. It was a very pleasant place, and near to it a"
256,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"poet's children were born; they had wandered in its wilds, had gathered"
257,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"its flowers, and admired its glow-worms, and listened to the"
258,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"turtle-doves, when they were very young; now, however, their home was"
259,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,near London; they only went to Winterdown about once a year for a great
260,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,holiday. The old turtle-doves talked about the poet's children in
261,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"Winterdown, and the young doves fancied that they lived there always."
262,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
263,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,[Illustration: THE POET'S CHILDREN.]
264,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
265,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,It was now the time for them to set off on their long journey; the old
266,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"doves had exercised their young ones, and they were sure that they could"
267,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,perform the journey. Next morning early they were to set off.
268,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
269,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"All night there was a light burning in the young musician's chamber,"
270,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"and towards morning the most heavenly music sounded from the window,"
271,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"which the old monk had opened a little, a very little, for fresh air,"
272,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,because his young friend had complained of the room being close and hot.
273,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,The sound awoke the doves; and they listened to what they still thought
274,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"a glorious bird. The little old man sat with his feeble hands together,"
275,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,and his head raised; it was the first time for years that he had ever
276,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"sat _so_; the young man played, and there was a heavenly joy in his"
277,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,soul; he knew not whether he was in heaven or earth; all his pain was
278,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"gone. It was a blissful moment; the next, and all was still in the"
279,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"chamber--wonderfully still. The lamp continued burning, a soft breeze"
280,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"blew in from the half-opened window, and just stirred the little old"
281,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"man's Carmelite frock, and lifted the young man's dark locks, but they"
282,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,neither of them moved.
283,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
284,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"""That glorious bird has done his singing for this morning,"" said the old"
285,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"doves; ""he will now sleep--let us set off; all our friends and neighbors"
286,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"are off already; we have a long journey before us."" The parent doves"
287,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"spread their wings; they and their elder ones were away, but the younger"
288,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,stayed as if entranced in the nest; he could think of nothing but the
289,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,glorious bird that had just been singing: his family wheeled round the
290,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"cypress, and then returned for him; they bade him come, for it was late."
291,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"The sun was rising above the sea, and all the doves of Carmel were ready"
292,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,for flight. The younger dove then spread its wings also for this long
293,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,"journey, bearing with him still the remembrance of that thrilling music"
294,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,which affected him so greatly.
295,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,
296,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,The turtle-doves went forth on their long journey. The young musician
297,MADE THEIR NEST NEAR HIS WINDOW.,and the little old monk had started before them on one much longer.

447,SHOES.,
448,SHOES.,"There was once a little girl who was very pretty and delicate, but in"
449,SHOES.,"the summer she was obliged to run about with bare feet, she was so poor,"
450,SHOES.,"and in the winter to wear large wooden shoes, which made her little"
451,SHOES.,"instep quite red, and that looked so dangerous!"
452,SHOES.,
453,SHOES.,"In the middle of the village lived old mother Shoemaker, and she sat and"
454,SHOES.,"sewed together, as well as she could, a little pair of shoes out of red"
455,SHOES.,"cloth; they were very clumsy, but it was a kind thought,--they were"
456,SHOES.,meant for the little girl.
457,SHOES.,
458,SHOES.,The little girl was called Karen. On the very day her mother was buried
459,SHOES.,"Karen received the red shoes, and wore them for the first time. They"
460,SHOES.,"were certainly not intended for mourning, but she had no others, and"
461,SHOES.,with stockingless feet she followed the poor straw coffin in them to the
462,SHOES.,grave.
463,SHOES.,
464,SHOES.,"Suddenly an old carriage drove up, and a large old lady sat in it; she"
465,SHOES.,"looked at the little girl, felt compassion for her, and then said to the"
466,SHOES.,clergyman--
467,SHOES.,
468,SHOES.,"""Here, give me that little girl, I will adopt her!"""
469,SHOES.,
470,SHOES.,"Karen believed all this happened on account of her red shoes, but the"
471,SHOES.,"old lady thought they were horrible, and so they were burnt; but Karen"
472,SHOES.,"was otherwise nicely clothed, and besides, had a pretty doll charmingly"
473,SHOES.,dressed in green.
474,SHOES.,
475,SHOES.,[Illustration: KAREN WITH HER DOLL.]
476,SHOES.,
477,SHOES.,She must now learn to read and sew; and people said she was a nice
478,SHOES.,"little girl; but the looking-glass said, ""Thou art more than nice, thou"
479,SHOES.,"art beautiful!"""
480,SHOES.,
481,SHOES.,"Now the queen once travelled through the land, and she had a daughter"
482,SHOES.,"with her, and this little daughter was a princess; and people streamed"
483,SHOES.,"to the castle, and Karen was there also, and the little princess stood"
484,SHOES.,"in her fine white dress, in a window, and let herself be stared at: she"
485,SHOES.,"had neither a train nor a golden crown, but splendid red morocco shoes."
486,SHOES.,They were certainly far handsomer than those mother Shoemaker had made.
487,SHOES.,
488,SHOES.,"Nothing in the world can compare with red shoes, thought Karen, and she"
489,SHOES.,greatly desired them.
490,SHOES.,
491,SHOES.,*       *       *       *       *
492,SHOES.,
493,SHOES.,"Now Karen was old enough to be _confirmed_ by the bishop, and that she"
494,SHOES.,"might be ready to go to the church, the old lady had new clothes made"
495,SHOES.,"for her, and took her to the rich shoemaker's in the city to select"
496,SHOES.,"some shoes. This took place in his store, where stood large glass cases,"
497,SHOES.,"filled with elegant shoes and brilliant boots. All this looked charming,"
498,SHOES.,"but the old lady could not see well, and so had no pleasure in looking"
499,SHOES.,at them. In the midst of these shoes stood a pair of red ones just like
500,SHOES.,those the little princess had worn. How beautiful they were! The
501,SHOES.,"shoemaker said also that they had been made for the child of a count,"
502,SHOES.,but had not fitted.
503,SHOES.,
504,SHOES.,"""That must be patent leather,"" said the old lady, ""they shine so."""
505,SHOES.,
506,SHOES.,"""Yes, they shine,"" said Karen, ""and I should be delighted to have them!"""
507,SHOES.,
508,SHOES.,"And they were tried on, and fitted her little foot so well that they"
509,SHOES.,"were bought; but the old lady knew nothing about their being red, else"
510,SHOES.,she would never have allowed Karen to have gone in red shoes to be
511,SHOES.,confirmed. Yet such was the case.
512,SHOES.,
513,SHOES.,Everybody looked at her feet; and when she stepped through the
514,SHOES.,"chancel-door on the church pavement, it seemed to her as if the old"
515,SHOES.,figures on the tombs--those portraits of old preachers and preachers'
516,SHOES.,"wives, with stiff ruffs and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her"
517,SHOES.,red shoes. And she thought only of them as the clergyman laid his hand
518,SHOES.,"upon her head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God,"
519,SHOES.,and how she should now become a true Christian; and the organ pealed so
520,SHOES.,"solemnly, the sweet children's voices sang, and the old music-directors;"
521,SHOES.,but Karen thought only of her red shoes.
522,SHOES.,
523,SHOES.,"In the afternoon the old lady heard that the shoes had been red, and she"
524,SHOES.,"said that it was very wrong of Karen, that it was not at all becoming,"
525,SHOES.,"and that in future Karen should only go in black shoes to church, even"
526,SHOES.,when she should be older.
527,SHOES.,
528,SHOES.,"The next Sunday there was to be the sacrament, and Karen looked at the"
529,SHOES.,"black shoes, then looked at the red ones,--looked at them again, and put"
530,SHOES.,on the red shoes.
531,SHOES.,
532,SHOES.,The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path
533,SHOES.,"through the corn; it was rather dusty, and their shoes were covered."
534,SHOES.,
535,SHOES.,"At the church-door stood an old soldier with a crutch, and with a"
536,SHOES.,"wonderful long beard which was more red than white, and he bowed to the"
537,SHOES.,ground and asked the old lady if he might dust her shoes; and Karen
538,SHOES.,stretched out her little foot.
539,SHOES.,
540,SHOES.,"""See! what beautiful dancing-shoes!"" said the soldier; ""sit firm--you"
541,SHOES.,"dance,"" and he put his hand out towards the soles."
542,SHOES.,
543,SHOES.,"And the old lady gave the soldier an alms, and went into the church with"
544,SHOES.,Karen.
545,SHOES.,
546,SHOES.,"And all the people in the church looked at Karen's red shoes, and all"
547,SHOES.,the pictures; and as Karen knelt before the altar and raised the cup to
548,SHOES.,"her lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed to swim in"
549,SHOES.,"it; and she forgot to sing her psalm, and she forgot to pray, ""Our"
550,SHOES.,"Father, who art in heaven!"""
551,SHOES.,
552,SHOES.,"Now all the people went out of the church, and the old lady got into the"
553,SHOES.,"carriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old"
554,SHOES.,soldier said--
555,SHOES.,
556,SHOES.,"""Look, what beautiful dancing-shoes!"""
557,SHOES.,
558,SHOES.,"And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began, her"
559,SHOES.,feet continued to dance; it was just as if the shoes had power over
560,SHOES.,"them. She danced round the church-corner, she could not leave off; the"
561,SHOES.,"coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her, and he lifted"
562,SHOES.,"her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she trod"
563,SHOES.,"on the old lady dreadfully. At length she took off the shoes, and then"
564,SHOES.,her legs had peace.
565,SHOES.,
566,SHOES.,"The shoes were placed in a closet at home, but Karen could not help"
567,SHOES.,looking at them.

838,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"Charley was a little boy, but he knew very well how to pity the poor,"
839,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,because he had a kind heart; and he knew very well that the poor
840,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,laborers he saw in the streets were not bad because they were meanly
841,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"dressed and worked hard: he knew they were men, and had hearts like his"
842,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"father and mother, and when they were dressed their appearance was very"
843,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"respectable, and at church no people were more devout or better"
844,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,mannered.
845,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,
846,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"One morning--it was winter--the sun shone down from the sky, and melted"
847,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"the snow and ice in the street and on the tops of the houses, so that it"
848,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"came tumbling down upon the sidewalks, and the streets were overflowing"
849,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,with the great flood. Charley was looking out of the window to see it
850,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"fall, and the people dodge and scamper along to save themselves from the"
851,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,great slides that would have been very dangerous if they had hit any one
852,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"on the head. He was thinking too of the poor little ragged boys, as they"
853,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"went by, some with matches, some with newspapers, and some with their"
854,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"hats in their hands begging, and he wished in his heart that he could do"
855,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"something to help them all; but he was but a little boy, and scarcely"
856,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,knew how to take care of himself. As he continued to watch the
857,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"passers-by, there came along a poor chimney-sweep, with his soot-bag"
858,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"and brush; his feet were very red, and looked as if they were bitten"
859,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"with the frost, for his shoes only half-covered his poor swollen feet,"
860,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,and he had no stockings on. His blanket that hung over his shoulders was
861,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"black as the chimney, and his face looked like soot."

865,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"Charley was watching him as he went along crying, ""Sweep, ho! sweep!"""
866,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,when down came one of these great slides right upon his head. He fell
867,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"flat in a moment, and there he lay as one dead, covered all over with"
868,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"the cold snow and ice. Charley rushed into the street in a moment, and"
869,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"screamed for help, but before he could reach the sweep a good man had"
870,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"raised him up, and was kindly brushing his clothes. He was not much"
871,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"hurt, but severely stunned. Charley took him by the hand and led him"
872,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"into the house, and gave him some dry clothes, and put some stockings"
873,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"and shoes upon his feet, and set before him a warm breakfast besides."
874,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,
875,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"The poor chimney-sweep wept--for so much kindness had touched his heart,"
876,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"and he sobbed out his thanks as well as he could, and took his leave"
877,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"after receiving some small pieces of silver, which. Charley's mother"
878,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,gave him to help him in his toil; for it was a toilsome life he had to
879,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"lead--that poor sweep; so young, too. It made Charley very sorry to see"
880,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"his tears, and he sat a long time with his head bent upon his breast,"
881,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,and never spoke one word. At last his mother said--
882,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,
883,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"""What troubles you, dear? Are you thinking of the unfortunate"
884,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"chimney-sweep? Then learn a lesson of gratitude for your own happy lot,"
885,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"and be humble; for remember that this poor sweep is as good as you, and"
886,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"perhaps far better in the sight of God, who looks at the heart and not"
887,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,at the outward appearance. See how much he must suffer in his poverty;
888,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,he may have feelings attuned in beautiful accord with all things noble
889,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,and charming in nature. He is really very intelligent-looking. He makes
890,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,me think of the little boy that ran through the streets of a large city
891,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"all of one cold winter, and then became a great artist, but he was so"
892,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"poor and inexperienced in the ways of the world, that he had to suffer a"
893,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,long time before his genius was discovered. Some time I will tell you
894,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEP.,"about him, that you may know that true genius and worth may be found"
