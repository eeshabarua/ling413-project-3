254,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"And near the high wall when those little boys came,"
255,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,They started as if from a toad:
256,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,
257,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"""That large ring of iron, you see on the ground,"
258,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"With terrible teeth like a saw,"""
259,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"Said their friend, ""the guard of our garden is found,"

262,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"""If any the warning without set at naught,"
263,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"Their legs then this man-trap must tear:"""
264,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"Said William to Thomas, ""So you'd have been caught,"
265,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,"If you had leapt over just there."""
266,THE BOYS AND THE APPLE-TREE,
