59,THE BASEMENT,"When Fritz, the Janitor's bad kid,"
60,THE BASEMENT,"Went snooping in the basement,"
61,THE BASEMENT,He found a rocket snugly hid
62,THE BASEMENT,Beneath the window casement.
63,THE BASEMENT,
64,THE BASEMENT,He struck a match with one fell swoop;
65,THE BASEMENT,"Then, on the concrete kneeling,"
66,THE BASEMENT,He lit the rocket and--she--oop!
67,THE BASEMENT,It shot up through the ceiling.

80,FIRST FLAT,"Crash! came the rocket, unannounced,"

82,FIRST FLAT,
83,FIRST FLAT,"It smote a catsup bottle, fair,"

85,FIRST FLAT,And now these people all declare
86,FIRST FLAT,That catsup flask was loaded.

98,SECOND FLAT,"Dozed in his arm-chair big,"
99,SECOND FLAT,When from a trunk the rocket burst
100,SECOND FLAT,And carried off his wig!
101,SECOND FLAT,
102,SECOND FLAT,It passed so near his ancient head
103,SECOND FLAT,"He roused up with a start,"
104,SECOND FLAT,"And, turning to his grandsons, said,"

118,THIRD FLAT,"When, oh! there came a blinding flash,"
119,THIRD FLAT,Precipitating trouble!
120,THIRD FLAT,
121,THIRD FLAT,"But Algy turned in mild disgust,"

135,FOURTH FLAT,"Jo Budd, who'd bought a potted plant,"
136,FOURTH FLAT,Was dousing it with water.
137,FOURTH FLAT,"He fancied this would make it grow,"
138,FOURTH FLAT,And Joseph loved to potter.
139,FOURTH FLAT,
140,FOURTH FLAT,Then through the pot the rocket shot
141,FOURTH FLAT,And made the scene look sickly!
142,FOURTH FLAT,"""Well, now,"" said Jo, ""I never thought"

154,FIFTH FLAT,Right here 'tis needful to remark
155,FIFTH FLAT,"That Dick and ""Little Son"""
156,FIFTH FLAT,Were playing with a Noah's ark
157,FIFTH FLAT,"And having loads of fun,"
158,FIFTH FLAT,
159,FIFTH FLAT,"When all at once that rocket, stout,"
160,FIFTH FLAT,Up through the ark came blazing!
161,FIFTH FLAT,The animals were tossed about
162,FIFTH FLAT,And did some stunts amazing.

173,SIXTH FLAT,A Burglar on the next floor up
174,SIXTH FLAT,The sideboard was exploring.
175,SIXTH FLAT,"(The family, with the brindled pup,"
176,SIXTH FLAT,Were still asleep and snoring.)
177,SIXTH FLAT,
178,SIXTH FLAT,"Just then, up through the silverware"
179,SIXTH FLAT,"The rocket thundered, flaring!"
180,SIXTH FLAT,The Burglar got a dreadful scare;
181,SIXTH FLAT,Then out the door went tearing.

194,SEVENTH FLAT,"To please her cousin, Amos Gill,"
195,SEVENTH FLAT,"Who liked that sort of thing,"
196,SEVENTH FLAT,
197,SEVENTH FLAT,"When suddenly the rocket, hot,"
198,SEVENTH FLAT,The old piano jumbled!
199,SEVENTH FLAT,"It stopped that rag-time like a shot,"
200,SEVENTH FLAT,Then through the ceiling rumbled.

212,EIGHTH FLAT,"That rocket, dread, went tearing"
213,EIGHTH FLAT,"Where Winkle stood in bath-robe, gay,"
214,EIGHTH FLAT,A tepid bath preparing.
215,EIGHTH FLAT,
216,EIGHTH FLAT,The tub it punctured like a shot
217,EIGHTH FLAT,And made a mighty splashing.
218,EIGHTH FLAT,The man was rooted to the spot;

231,NINTH FLAT,"His football to inflate,"
232,NINTH FLAT,"While round him stood his faithful guard,"
233,NINTH FLAT,And they could hardly wait.
234,NINTH FLAT,
235,NINTH FLAT,"Then came the rocket, fierce and bright,"
236,NINTH FLAT,And through the football rumbled.
237,NINTH FLAT,"""You've got a pair of lungs, all right!"""
238,NINTH FLAT,His staring playmates grumbled.

251,TENTH FLAT,"When, poof! the rocket flashed between,"
252,TENTH FLAT,And quite astonished Towzer.
253,TENTH FLAT,
254,TENTH FLAT,"Now, if this dog had wit enough"
255,TENTH FLAT,"The English tongue to torture,"
256,TENTH FLAT,He might have growled such silly stuff

268,ELEVENTH FLAT,While Carrie Cook sat with a book
269,ELEVENTH FLAT,The phonograph played sweetly.
270,ELEVENTH FLAT,Then came the rocket and it smashed
271,ELEVENTH FLAT,That instrument completely.
272,ELEVENTH FLAT,
273,ELEVENTH FLAT,"Fair Carrie promptly turned her head,"
274,ELEVENTH FLAT,Attracted by the roar.
275,ELEVENTH FLAT,"""Dear me, I never heard,"" she said,"

288,TWELFTH FLAT,"To light a cigarette,"
289,TWELFTH FLAT,"But failed to find one with despatch,"
290,TWELFTH FLAT,Which threw him in a pet.
291,TWELFTH FLAT,
292,TWELFTH FLAT,Just then the rocket flared up bright
293,TWELFTH FLAT,"Before his face and crackled,"
294,TWELFTH FLAT,Supplying him the needed light--
295,TWELFTH FLAT,"""Thanks, awfully,"" he cackled."

306,THIRTEENTH FLAT,Home from the shop came Maud's new hat--
307,THIRTEENTH FLAT,A hat of monstrous size!
308,THIRTEENTH FLAT,It almost filled the tiny flat
309,THIRTEENTH FLAT,Before her ravished eyes.
310,THIRTEENTH FLAT,
311,THIRTEENTH FLAT,"When, sch-u-u! up through the box so proud"
312,THIRTEENTH FLAT,The rocket flared and spluttered.
313,THIRTEENTH FLAT,"""I said that hat was all too loud!"""

327,FOURTEENTH FLAT,"Had not the rocket, raising Cain,"
328,FOURTEENTH FLAT,Blocked traffic on the line.
329,FOURTEENTH FLAT,
330,FOURTEENTH FLAT,"It blew the engine into scrap,"
331,FOURTEENTH FLAT,As in a fit of passion.
332,FOURTEENTH FLAT,"""Who would have thought that toy,"" said pap,"

347,FIFTEENTH FLAT,"""Here's a report worth heeding."""
348,FIFTEENTH FLAT,
349,FIFTEENTH FLAT,The rocket then in wanton sport
350,FIFTEENTH FLAT,Flashed through the printed pages.
351,FIFTEENTH FLAT,"The lady gasped, ""A wild report!"""

363,SIXTEENTH FLAT,"Doc Danby was a stupid guy,"
364,SIXTEENTH FLAT,"So, lest he sleep too late,"
365,SIXTEENTH FLAT,He placed a tattoo clock near by
366,SIXTEENTH FLAT,To waken him at eight.
367,SIXTEENTH FLAT,
368,SIXTEENTH FLAT,"But, ah! the rocket smote that clock"
369,SIXTEENTH FLAT,And smashed its way clean through it!
370,SIXTEENTH FLAT,"""You have a fine alarm,"" said Doc,"

383,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,Was writing a description.
384,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,"""The flame shot up,"" he pounded out--"
385,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,Then threw a mild conniption.
386,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,
387,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,For through his Flemington there shied
388,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,"A rocket, hot and mystic."
389,SEVENTEENTH FLAT,"""I didn't mean to be,"" he cried,"

404,EIGHTEENTH FLAT,"""It might explode. I mention--"""
405,EIGHTEENTH FLAT,
406,EIGHTEENTH FLAT,Just then the pesky rocket flared
407,EIGHTEENTH FLAT,And wrecked that Yankee notion.

444,TWENTIETH FLAT,"When suddenly the rocket, bright,"
