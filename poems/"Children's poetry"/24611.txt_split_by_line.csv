109,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],DERBY LONDON & WATFORD]
110,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
111,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
112,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"In Spring,"
113,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],While softly cooed
114,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"The Dove,"
115,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
116,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Sam
117,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Told Selina of
118,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],His Love.
119,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
120,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
121,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
122,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
123,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
124,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"The Summer Moon smiled on them both,"
125,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Selina plighted him her Troth.
126,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
127,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But Autumn brought a gayer Swain--
128,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Selina broke it off again.
129,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
130,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
131,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
132,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
133,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
134,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],'Tis Winter now--
135,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Selina's slack--
136,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],She'd give her thumbs to have him back.
137,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
138,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Yet--
139,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],When they met
140,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],She tossed her head;
141,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
142,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],He
143,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Stared at her and
144,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Cut her dead!
145,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
146,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
147,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
148,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
149,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
150,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But Fate at last to them was kind:
151,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],It sent
152,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],a
153,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Roaring,"
154,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Raging
155,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Wind!
156,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
157,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Which,"
158,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Just as Sam was passing by,"
159,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Blew off Selina's Hat!
160,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Oh! My!
161,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
162,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Sam
163,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Caught it--by a daring jump.
164,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
165,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Selina's
166,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Heart
167,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],went
168,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Thump! Thump!! Thump!!!
169,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
170,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"""Oh, Sam!"" she cried;"
171,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Tears dimmed her sight--
172,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And after that it all came right.
173,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
174,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
175,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
176,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
177,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
178,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],They made it up--and very soon
179,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],They started on their Honeymoon.
180,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
181,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Selina proved a model wife,"
182,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Her Sam was all her joy in life;
183,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"She fetched his shoes and darned his hose,"
184,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And sympathized with all his woes.
185,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
186,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
187,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
188,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
189,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
190,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"And,"
191,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"As she let him have his say,"
192,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],He loved her more from day to day;
193,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"And--on her birthday--for a spree,"
194,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Took her to the Menagerie.
195,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
196,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"She revelled in the Monkey Walk,"
197,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Where Apes, of motley hue,"
198,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Each jumped--upon a yellow stick--
199,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],All shining and brand new.
200,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
201,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
202,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
203,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
204,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
205,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"And picture, children, how the Snarks"
206,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Rejoiced her frugal mind;
207,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"They ate the Buns, they ate the Bag,"
208,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And even stale cheese rind.
209,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
210,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"The Jub-jub birds Selina fed,"
211,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But they were rude and rough;
212,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"They fought and scratched,"
213,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Nor would they stop
214,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],When they had had enough.
215,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
216,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
217,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
218,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
219,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
220,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"At last,"
221,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"When happy, hot and tired,"
222,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"They found no more to see,"
223,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Sam took her to a shady spot
224,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And treated her to tea.
225,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
226,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Selina's hat and dress he praised,"
227,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],She clapped his feeblest puns;
228,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],It was a perfect carnival
229,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Of sentiment and Buns!
230,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
231,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Much time, alas! they cannot spare,"
232,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Since holidays are few;
233,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Soon, hand in hand, they start afresh"
234,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],To seek adventures new.
235,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
236,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And all about along the walks
237,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Stern ""Cautions"" they espy;"
238,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"""You need not fear,"" said Samuel,"
239,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"""While I, my love, am nigh."""
240,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
241,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
242,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
243,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
244,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
245,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Alas! how brief are mortal joys;
246,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],There comes an awful burbling noise!
247,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
248,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"As, terror-struck, he turns to fly,"
249,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Too late he hears her anguished cry,"
250,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
251,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"""O Samuel!"
252,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],O Samuel!!
253,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
254,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Beware!
255,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],The awful
256,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Camuel""!!!"
257,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
258,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
259,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
260,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
261,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
262,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],The Camel rushed!
263,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],The Camel flew!
264,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Till all its spots were streaks of blue;
265,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],To Samuel it seemed to be
266,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Itself a whole
267,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Menagerie!
268,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
269,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],The Camel chased him round and round;
270,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],He sank--exhausted--on the ground;
271,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"The Camel never noticed that,"
272,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But pranced along--
273,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],with Sammy's hat.
274,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
275,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
276,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
277,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
278,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
279,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"_And_--when it found its victim gone,"
280,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Imagine how the brute went on;
281,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],It bucked and reared
282,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],and kicked
283,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"and shied,"
284,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Till, finally,"
285,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],It BUST!
286,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],and died.
287,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
288,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],When Sammy heard the loud report
289,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"And saw the pieces fly,"
290,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"He felt that sure as eggs was eggs,"
291,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"He, too, must surely die."
292,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
293,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"But brave Selina, though her tears"
294,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Fell all the while like rain,"
295,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Washed off the dirt and set him up
296,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Upon his feet again.
297,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
298,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
299,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
300,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
301,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
302,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"She found the remnants of his hat,"
303,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And led him to the gate;
304,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But there the Camel's owner stood
305,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],As large and grim as fate.
306,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
307,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Before they left, that greedy man"
308,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"Took all the cash they had,"
309,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And turned their pockets inside-out
310,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],(Which made Selina mad).
311,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
312,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],How different their coming home
313,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],From their gay start at morn;
314,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],They creep along--a sorry sight--
315,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Bedraggled and forlorn.
316,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
317,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"He knows he showed a want of pluck,"
318,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Whatever she may say;
319,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],She feels that it was all her fault
320,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],For having a birthday.
321,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],

323,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
324,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],[Illustration]
325,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
326,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],But--once at home--the ruddy blaze
327,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Each drooping spirit cheers;
328,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],Sam sets Selina by the fire
329,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],And wipes away her tears.
330,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],
331,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],He draws her closer to his side;
332,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"He tootles on a comb,"
333,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"And sings her, as her sobs subside,"
334,DERBY LONDON & WATFORD],"A verse of ""Home, Sweet Home."""
