93,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,[Illustration]
94,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
95,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"The reader, perhaps, as he turns over the first pages of this volume,"
96,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"is puzzled, right at the outset, with the meaning of my title, _The"
97,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"Diving Bell_. It is plain enough to Uncle Frank, and possibly it is to"
98,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"you; but it may not be; so I will tell you what a diving bell is, and"
99,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"then, probably, you can guess the reason why I have given this name to"
100,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,the following pages.
101,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
102,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"If you will take a common glass tumbler, and plunge it into water,"
103,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"with the mouth downwards, you will find that very little water will"
104,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,rise into the tumbler. You can satisfy yourself better about this
105,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"matter, if, in the first place, you lay a cork upon the surface of the"
106,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"water, and then put the tumbler over it."
107,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
108,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"Did you ever try the experiment? Try it now, if you never have done"
109,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"so, and if you have any doubt on the subject."
110,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
111,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"You might suppose, that the cork would be carried down far below the"
112,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"surface of the water. But it is not so. The upper side of the cork,"
113,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,after you have pressed the tumbler down so low that the upper end of
114,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,it is even below the surface of the water--the upper side of the cork
115,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,is not wet at all.
116,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
117,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"""And what is the reason of this, Uncle Frank?"""
118,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
119,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"I will tell you. There is air in the tumbler, when you plunge it into"
120,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"the water. The air stays in the vessel, so that there is no room for"
121,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,the water.
122,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
123,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"""Oh, yes, sir; I see how that is. But I see that a little water finds"
124,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"its way into the tumbler, every time I try the experiment. How is"
125,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"that?"""
126,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
127,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"You can press air, the same as you can press wood, or paper, or cloth,"
128,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,so that it will go into a smaller space than it occupied before you
129,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,pressed it. Did you ever make a pop-gun?
130,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
131,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"""Oh, yes, sir, a hundred times."""
132,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
133,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"Well, when you send the wad out of the pop-gun, you do it by pressing"
134,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,the air inside the tube. Now if your tumbler was a hundred or a
135,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"thousand times as large, the air would prevent the water from coming"
136,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"in, just as it does in this instance. Suppose I had dropped a purse"
137,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"full of gold into a very deep river, and it had sunk to the bottom."
138,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,Suppose I could not get it in any other way but by going down to the
139,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"bottom after it. I could go down to that depth, and live there for"
140,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"some time, by means of a diving bell made large enough to hold me,"
141,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,precisely in the same way that a bird might go down to the bottom of a
142,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"tub of water, in a tumbler, and stand there with the water hardly over"
143,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"his feet. There is a good deal of machinery about a diving bell, it"
144,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,is true. But I need not take up much time in describing it. It is
145,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"necessary for the man to breathe, of course, while he is in the diving"
146,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"bell; and as the air it contains is soon rendered impure by breathing,"
147,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"fresh air must be introduced into the bell by means of a pump, or in"
148,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"some other way. I am not very familiar with the necessary machinery,"
149,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"to tell the truth. I never explored the bottom of a river in this way,"
150,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,and I think it will be a long time before I make such a voyage.
151,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
152,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,The diving bell has been used for a good many useful purposes--to lay
153,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,the foundations of docks and the piers of bridges; to collect pearls
154,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"at Ceylon, and coral at other places."
155,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
156,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,I am not sure but the diving bell is getting somewhat out of use now.
157,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,People have found out another way of groping along on the bottom of
158,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"rivers and seas. They do it frequently, I believe, by means of a kind"
159,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"of armor made of India rubber. But so far as my book is concerned, it"
160,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,is of no consequence whether the diving bell is out of use or not. I
161,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"shall use the title, at all events."
162,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
163,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"If, after my account of the diving bell, you still ask why I choose"
164,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"to give such a name to the budget I have prepared for you, I can"
165,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,answer your question very easily.
166,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,
167,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,I think you will find something worth looking at in the budget--not
168,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"pearls, or pieces of coral, or lost treasures, exactly, but still"
169,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"something which will please you, and something which, when you get"
170,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"hold of it, will be worth keeping and laying up in some snug corner of"
171,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,your memory box. I say _when you get hold of it_; for the valuable
172,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,things I have for you do not all lie on the surface. You will have to
173,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"_search_ for them a little. That is, you will have to think. When you"
174,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"have read one of my stories, or fables, you may find it necessary to"
175,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"stop, and ask yourself ""What does Uncle Frank mean by all this?"" In"
176,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"other words, you will have to use the diving bell, and see if you"
177,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"can't hunt up something in the story or the fable, which will be"
178,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"useful to you, and which will make you wiser and better. Now you see"
179,THE NAME OF MY BOOK.,"why I have called my book _The Diving Bell_, don't you?"

187,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
188,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
189,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"It is Uncle Frank's notion, that it is a good thing to laugh, but a"
190,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"better thing to think. A great many people, however, old as well as"
191,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"young, and young as well as old, live and die without thinking much."
192,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,They lose three quarters of the benefit they ought to get from
193,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"reading, and from what they see and learn as they go through the"
194,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"world, by never diving below the surface of things. I don't suppose"
195,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"it is so with you. I hope not, at all events. If it is so, then you"
196,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"had better shut up this book, and pass it over to some young friend of"
197,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"yours, who has learned to think, and who loves to read books that will"
198,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"help him about thinking. No, on the whole, you needn't do any such"
199,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,thing. Just read the book--read it through. Perhaps you will get a
200,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"taste for such reading, while you are going through the book."
201,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
202,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,I must tell you an anecdote just here. You will not refuse to read
203,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"that, at any rate."
204,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
205,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"Not long ago I was in a book store, looking over some new books which"
206,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"I saw on the counter, when a fine-looking boy, who appeared to be"
207,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"about nine years old, came in. He had a shilling in his hand, and said"
208,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,he wanted to buy a book.
209,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
210,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""But what book do you want?"" one of the clerks asked."
211,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
212,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"The boy could not tell what it was exactly. But it was a ""funny"
213,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"book""--he was sure of that--and it cost a shilling."
214,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
215,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"Well, it finally turned out that the book which the little fellow"
216,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,wanted was a comic almanac--a book filled with miserable
217,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,pictures--pictures of men and beasts twisted into all sorts of odd
218,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"shapes--and vulgar jokes, and scraps of low wit."
219,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
220,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Will you let me look at it?"" I asked the little boy as the clerk"
221,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,handed the book to him.
222,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
223,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Yes, sir,"" said he."
224,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
225,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"I took the almanac, and turned over some of its leaves. There was not"
226,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"a particle of information in the book, except what related to the sun,"
227,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"and moon, and stars, and that formed but a small portion of the"
228,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"volume. ""My son,"" said I, pleasantly, ""what do you buy this book"
229,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"for?"""
230,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
231,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""To make me laugh,"" said he."
232,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
233,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""But is _that_ all you read books for--to find something to laugh at?"""
234,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,I inquired.
235,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
236,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""No, sir,"" he replied, ""but then this book is _so_ funny. Giles Manly"
237,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"has got one, and""--he hesitated."
238,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
239,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""He has a great time over it,"" I interrupted, to which the little boy"
240,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"nodded, as much as to say,"
241,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
242,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Yes, sir, that's it."""
243,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
244,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Did your father send you after this book?"" I asked."
245,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
246,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""No, sir."""
247,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
248,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Did your mother tell you to get it?"""
249,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
250,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""No, sir. But my mother gave me a shilling, and told me I might buy"
251,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"just such a book as I liked."""
252,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
253,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Well, my son,"" said I, ""look here. You have heard Giles read some of"
254,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"the funny things in this almanac, have you not?"""
255,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
256,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Yes, sir."""
257,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
258,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""And you've seen some of the pictures?"""
259,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
260,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Yes, sir, all of them."""
261,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
262,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Then you know pretty well what the book is?"""
263,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
264,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Yes, sir, all about it, and that's what makes me want to buy it."""
265,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
266,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Well, you have a right to buy just such a book as you want. But if I"
267,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"were in your place, I would not buy that book; and I'll tell you why."
268,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"There's a good deal of fun in it, to be sure. No doubt you would laugh"
269,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"over it, if you had it. But you can't learn anything from it. Come,"
270,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"now, I'll make a bargain with you. Here's a book""--I handed him one of"
271,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"the _Lucy_ books, written by Mr. _Jacob Abbott_--""which is worth a"
272,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"dozen of that. This will make you laugh some, as well as the other"
273,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,book; and it will do much more and better than that. It will set you
274,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"to _thinking_. It will instruct, as well as amuse you. It will sow"
275,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"some good seeds in your mind, and your heart, too. It will teach you"
276,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,to be a _thinker_ as well as a reader. It costs a little more than
277,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"that almanac, it is true. But never mind that. If you'll take this"
278,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"book, and give the gentleman your shilling, I'll pay him the rest of"
279,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"the money. Will you do it? Will you take the Lucy book, and leave the"
280,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"funny almanac?"""
281,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
282,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,He hesitated. He hardly knew whether he should make or lose by the
283,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,trade.
284,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
285,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""If you will do so,"" I continued, ""and read the book, when you get"
286,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"through with it, you may come to my office in Nassau street, and tell"
287,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"me how you was pleased with it. Then, if you say that you did not like"
288,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,Mr. Abbott's book so well as you think you would have liked the book
289,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"with the funny pictures, and tell me that you made a bad bargain, I'll"
290,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"take back the Lucy book, and give you the almanac in the place of it."""
291,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
292,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,That pleased the little fellow. The bargain was struck. Mr. Abbott's
293,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"book was bought, and the boy left the store, and ran home."
294,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
295,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"I think it was about a week after that, or it might have been a"
296,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"little longer, that I heard my name spoken, as I was sitting at my"
297,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"desk. I turned around, and, sure enough, there was the identical boy"
298,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,with whom I had made the trade at the book store.
299,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
300,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Well, my little fellow,"" I said, ""you've got sick of your bargain,"
301,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"eh?"" ""No, sir,"" he said, ""I'm glad I made it;"" and he proceeded to"
302,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,tell me his errand. It seemed that he had been so pleased with the
303,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"book, that he ""wanted a few more of the same sort,"" as the razor strop"
304,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"man says; and his father had told him that he might come to me, ask"
305,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,me to get all the Lucy books for him.
306,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
307,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"Now you see how it was with that little fellow, before he read the"
308,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,book I gave him. He had got the notion that a child's book could not
309,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,be amusing--could not be worth reading--unless it was filled with such
310,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"nonsense as there was in the ""funny book"" he called for. He had not"
311,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,got a _taste_ for reading anything else. As soon as he did get such a
312,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"taste, he liked that kind of reading the best; because, besides making"
313,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"him laugh a little now and then, it put some thoughts into his"
314,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,head--gave him some hints which would be worth something to him in
315,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,after life.
316,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
317,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"Now, I presume there are a great many boys and girls, who love to read"
318,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"such nonsense as one finds in comic almanacs, and books like"
319,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"""Bluebeard,"" and ""Jack the Giant Killer,"" but who, like the youth I"
320,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"met in the book store, could very easily learn to like useful books"
321,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"just as well, and better too, if they would only take them up, and"
322,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,read them.
323,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
324,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"Why, my little friends, a book need not be dull and dry, because it is"
325,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"not all nonsense. Uncle Frank don't mean to have a long face on, when"
326,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,he writes for young people. He believes in laughing. He likes to laugh
327,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"himself, and he likes to see his young friends laugh, too, sometimes."
328,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,
329,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"I hope, indeed, that you will find this little book amusing, as well"
330,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,"as useful; though I should be very sorry if it were not useful, as"
331,THINKING AND LAUGHING.,well as amusing.

514,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
515,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
516,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Genius, in its infancy, sometimes puts on a very funny face. The first"
517,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,efforts of a painter are generally rude enough. So are those of a
518,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"poet, or any other artist. I have often wished I might see the first"
519,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"picture that such a man as Titian, or Rubens, or Reynolds, or West,"
520,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"ever drew. It would interest me much, and, I suspect, would provoke a"
521,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"smile or two, at the expense of the young artists."
522,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
523,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,History does not often transmit such sketches to the world. But I wish
524,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"it would. I wish the picture of the sheep that Giotto was sketching,"
525,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"when Cimabue, one of the greatest painters of his age, came across"
526,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"him, could be produced. I would go miles to see it. And I wish West's"
527,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"mother had carefully preserved, for some public gallery, the picture"
528,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,that her son Benjamin made of the little baby in the cradle. You have
529,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"heard that story, I dare say."
530,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
531,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Benjamin, you know, showed a taste for drawing and painting, when he"
532,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,was a very little boy. His early advantages were but few. But he made
533,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,the most of these advantages; and the result was that he became one of
534,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"the first painters of his day, and before he died, he was chosen"
535,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,President of the Royal Society in London. How do you think he made his
536,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,colors? You will smile when you hear that they were formed with
537,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"charcoal and chalk, with an occasional sprinkling of the juice of red"
538,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,berries. His brush was rather a rude one. It was made of the hair he
539,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"pulled from the tail of Pussy, the family cat. Poor old cat! she lost"
540,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"so much of her fur to supply the young artist with brushes, that the"
541,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,family began to feel a good deal of anxiety for her pussyship. They
542,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"thought her hair fell off by disease, until Benjamin, who was an"
543,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"honest boy, one day informed them of their mistake. What a pity that"
544,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,the world could not have the benefit of one of the pictures that West
545,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,painted with his cat-tail brush.
546,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
547,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"And then, what a treat it would be, to get hold of the first rhymes"
548,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,that Watts and Pope ever made. I believe that Watts had been rhyming
549,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,some time when he got a fatherly flogging for this exercise of his
550,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"genius, and he sobbed out, between the blows,"
551,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
552,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"""Dear father, do some pity take,"
553,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"And I will no more verses make."""
554,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
555,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"That couplet was not his first one, by a good deal. The habit, it"
556,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"would seem, had taken a pretty strong hold of him, when the whipping"
557,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,drew that out of him.
558,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
559,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,It seems to me that the childhood and early youth of a genius are more
560,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"interesting than any riper periods of his life; or rather, that they"
561,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"become so, when time and circumstances have developed what there was"
562,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"in the man, and when from the stand-point of his fame in manhood, we"
563,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,look back upon his early history. What small beginnings there have
564,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,been to all the efforts of those who have made themselves masters of
565,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,the particular art to which they have directed their attention.
566,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
567,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,I wonder what kind of a thing Washington Irving's first composition
568,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"was. There must have been a first one; and, without doubt, it was a"
569,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"clumsy affair enough. If I were going to write his history, I would"
570,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"find those who knew him when he was a mere child, and I would pump"
571,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,from them as many anecdotes about his little scribblings as I possibly
572,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"could, and I would print them, lots of them. I hardly think I could do"
573,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,the reader of his biography a better service.
574,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
575,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,I wonder what his first experience was with the editors. These
576,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"editors, by the way, are often very troublesome to the young sprig of"
577,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"genius. Placed, as they are, at the door of the temple of fame, they"
578,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"often seem to the unfledged author the most disobliging, iron-hearted"
579,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"men in the world. He could walk right into the temple, and make"
580,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"himself perfectly at home there, if they would only open the door. So"
581,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,he fancies; and he wonders why the barbarians don't see the genius
582,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"sticking out, when he comes along with his nicely-written verses, and"
583,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"why they don't just give him, at once, a ticket of admission to the"
584,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"honors of the world. ""These editors are slow to perceive merit,"" he"
585,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,says to himself.
586,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
587,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,Your old friend Uncle Frank once set himself up for a genius. Don't
588,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"laugh--pray, don't laugh. I was young then, and as green as a juvenile"
589,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"gosling. Age has branded into me a great many truths, which, somehow"
590,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"or other, were very slow in finding their way to my young mind. The"
591,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"notion that I am a genius does not haunt me now, and a great many"
592,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,years have passed since such a vision flitted across my imagination.
593,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"But I will tell you how I was cooled off, once on a time, when I got"
594,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"into a raging fever of authorship, and was burning up with a desire to"
595,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,make an impression on the world. I had written some verses--written
596,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"them with great care, and with ever so many additions, subtractions,"
597,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"and divisions. They were perfect, at last--that is, I could not make"
598,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,them any more perfect--and off they were posted to the editor of the
599,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,village newspaper. I declare I don't remember what they were about.
600,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"But I dare say, they were ""Lines"" to somebody, or ""Stanzas"" to"
601,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"something; and I remember they were signed ""Theodore Thinker,"" in a"
602,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"very large, and as I then thought, a very fair hand."
603,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
604,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"""Well, did the editor print them, Uncle Frank?"""
605,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
606,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Hold on, my dear fellow. You are quite too fast. As I said, when the"
607,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"lines to somebody or something were sent to the editor, I was in a"
608,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"perfect fever. I could hardly wait for Wednesday to come, the day on"
609,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,which the paper was to be issued--the paper which was to be the medium
610,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"of the first acquaintance of my muse with ""a discerning public."""
611,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
612,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"""Well, how did you feel when the lines were printed?"""
613,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
614,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"When they were printed! Alas, for my fame! they were not printed at"
615,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"all. The editor rejected them. ""Theodore's lines,"" said he--the great"
616,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"clown! what did _he_ know about poetry?--""Theodore's lines have gone"
617,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"to the shades. They possessed some merit,""--_some_ merit! that's all"
618,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"he knows about poetry; the brute!--""but not enough to entitle them to"
619,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"a place. Still, whenever age and experience have sufficiently"
620,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"developed his genius,""--mark the smooth and oily manner in which the"
621,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"savage knocks a poor fellow down, and treads on his neck--""whenever"
622,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"age and experience have sufficiently developed his genius, we shall be"
623,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"happy to hear from him again."""
624,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
625,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"If you can fancy how a man feels, when he is taken from an oven,"
626,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"pretty nearly hot enough to bake corn bread, and plunged into a very"
627,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"cold bath, indeed--say about forty degrees Fahrenheit--you can form"
628,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,some idea of my feelings when I read that paragraph in the editorial
629,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"column, under the notice ""To correspondents."""
630,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
631,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,I am inclined to think there are a great many little folks climbing up
632,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"the stairs of the stage of life, who verily believe that genius has"
633,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"got them by the hand, leading them along, but who, in fact, are not a"
634,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,little mistaken. It is rather important that one should know whether
635,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"he has any genius or not; and if he has, in what particular direction"
636,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,he will be likely to distinguish himself.
637,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
638,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,I don't believe in the old-fashioned notion that people all come into
639,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"the world with minds and tastes so unlike, that, if you educate one"
640,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"ever so carefully, he never will make a poet, or a painter, or a"
641,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"musician, as the case may be; while the other will be a master in one"
642,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"of these branches, with scarcely any instruction. But I do believe"
643,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,there is a great difference in natural capacities for a particular
644,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"art; and that some persons learn that art easily, while others learn"
645,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"it with difficulty, and could, perhaps, never excel in it, if they"
646,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,should drive at it for a life-time.
647,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
648,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Ralph Waldo, a boy who lived near our house, when I was a child, was"
649,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"the sport of all the neighborhood, on account of the high estimate in"
650,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,which he held his talent at drawing pictures. Now it so happened that
651,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Ralph's pictures, to say the least, were rather poor specimens of the"
652,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"art. Some of them, according to the best of my recollection, would"
653,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,never have suggested the particular animal or thing for which they
654,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"were made, if they had not been labeled, or if Ralph had not called"
655,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,them by name.
656,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
657,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Such dogs and cats, such horses and cows, such houses and trees, such"
658,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"men and women, were never seen since the world began, as those which"
659,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,figured on his slate. And yet he thought a great deal of his
660,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"pictures. How happy it used to make him, when some of the boys in the"
661,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"neighborhood, perhaps purely out of sport, would say, ""Come, Ralph,"
662,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"let's see you make a horse now."" With what zeal he used to set himself"
663,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"about the task of making a horse. When it was done, and ready for"
664,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"exhibition, though it was a perfect scare-crow of a thing, he used to"
665,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"hold it up, with ever so much pride expressed in the rough features of"
666,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"his face, as if it were an effort worthy of being hung up in the"
667,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"Academy of Design, or the Gallery of Fine Arts."
668,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,
669,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,This state of things lasted for some years. But Ralph did not make
670,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"much progress in the art. His horses continued to be the same stiff,"
671,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"awkward things that they were at first. So did his cows, and oxen, and"
672,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"dogs, and cats, and men. It became pretty evident, at least to"
673,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"everybody except the young artist himself, that he never would shine"
674,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"in his favorite profession. He was not ""cut out for it,"" apparently,"
675,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"though it took a great while to beat the idea out of his head, that he"
676,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,was going to make one of the greatest painters in the country. When he
677,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"became a young man, however, he had sense enough to choose the"
678,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"carpenter's trade, instead of the painter's art. I think he showed a"
679,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"great deal more judgment than many other people do, who imagine they"
680,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,are destined to astonish two or three continents with their wonderful
681,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"productions in some department of the fine arts, but who,"
682,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,"unfortunately, are not much better fitted for either of them than a"
683,GENIUS IN THE BUD.,goose or a sheep.

1344,THE WRONG WAY.,"people of his age, he needed to be punished sometimes, and sometimes"
1345,THE WRONG WAY.,"his parents did deal pretty sternly with him. Edward had a sister,"
1346,THE WRONG WAY.,"older than himself, by some years. Fanny--for this was the name of the"
1347,THE WRONG WAY.,"girl--tried one day, to tame little Eddy, when, according to her"
1348,THE WRONG WAY.,"notion, he was inclined to be too wild. Fanny was grieved to see her"
1349,THE WRONG WAY.,"brother act so rudely. They were visiting that day, at Aunt Sally's,"
1350,THE WRONG WAY.,and it was natural enough that Fanny should wish to have her brother
1351,THE WRONG WAY.,behave as well as he could.
1352,THE WRONG WAY.,

1371,THE WRONG WAY.,"At this point in the dispute between the brother and sister, Aunt"
1372,THE WRONG WAY.,Sally thought it was best to put a stop to it. She saw that Fanny
1373,THE WRONG WAY.,"could do no good to Edward, while he was in that mood, and so she said"
1374,THE WRONG WAY.,a word or two which turned the thoughts of both the brother and sister
1375,THE WRONG WAY.,into another channel.
1376,THE WRONG WAY.,
1377,THE WRONG WAY.,"I suppose it can hardly be necessary to say to you, that, whatever"

1406,THE RIGHT WAY.,"suppose that he ought to have listened to her, when she talked to"
1407,THE RIGHT WAY.,him. But he did not. He was just as rude as ever; and his sister was
1408,THE RIGHT WAY.,"afraid that, when his mamma heard of his conduct, she would feel"

1410,THE RIGHT WAY.,

1414,THE RIGHT WAY.,"And so, you see, the wild, rattle-headed boy, who was so full of fun,"
1415,THE RIGHT WAY.,"that he could hardly hold in, and who was so wild that Fanny thought"
1416,THE RIGHT WAY.,"it was best to check him with a curb bit, something as she would a"
1417,THE RIGHT WAY.,"young colt, was completely tamed by this soft, gentle language. My"
1418,THE RIGHT WAY.,"young friend, don't you think there's great power in such words? I do,"
1419,THE RIGHT WAY.,"and I advise you, when you are dealing with such a ""young colt"" as"

1504,ON BARKING DOGS.,It is an old saying--and there is a good deal of truth in it--that
1505,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""barking dogs never bite."" I say there is a good deal of truth in it."
1506,ON BARKING DOGS.,It is not strictly true. Scarcely any proverb will bear picking to
1507,ON BARKING DOGS.,"pieces, and analyzing, as a botanist would pick to pieces and analyze"
1508,ON BARKING DOGS.,"a rose or a tulip. Almost all dogs bark a little, now and then. Still"
1509,ON BARKING DOGS.,"I believe those dogs bark the most that bite the least, and the dogs"
1510,ON BARKING DOGS.,"that make a practice of biting the hardest and the oftenest, make very"
1511,ON BARKING DOGS.,little noise about it.
1512,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1513,ON BARKING DOGS.,"Have you never been passing by a house, and seen a little pocket"
1514,ON BARKING DOGS.,"edition of a cur run out of the front door yard, to meet you, with"
1515,ON BARKING DOGS.,"ever so much bravery and heroism, as if he intended to eat you at two"
1516,ON BARKING DOGS.,"or three mouthfuls? What a barking he set up. The meaning of his _bow,"
1517,ON BARKING DOGS.,"wow, wow_, every time he repeated the words, was, ""I'll bite you! I'll"
1518,ON BARKING DOGS.,"bite you!"" But the very moment you turned round and faced him, he ran"
1519,ON BARKING DOGS.,"back into the yard, as if forty tigers were after him. You see he was"
1520,ON BARKING DOGS.,"all bark, and no bite."
1521,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1522,ON BARKING DOGS.,"Well, it is about the same with men and women, and boys and girls, as"

1529,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1530,ON BARKING DOGS.,"There is Tom Thrasher. You don't know Tom, do you? Well, he is one of"
1531,ON BARKING DOGS.,your barking dogs. He is all the time boasting of the great things he
1532,ON BARKING DOGS.,is able to do. Nobody ever saw him do any such things. Still he keeps
1533,ON BARKING DOGS.,"on boasting, right in the midst of the young people who know him"
1534,ON BARKING DOGS.,"through and through, a great deal better than he knows himself. It is"
1535,ON BARKING DOGS.,strange that he should brag at that rate where everybody knows him.
1536,ON BARKING DOGS.,"But he has fallen into the habit of bragging, and I suppose he hardly"
1537,ON BARKING DOGS.,thinks of the absurd and foolish language he is using. According to
1538,ON BARKING DOGS.,"his account of himself, he can run a mile in a minute, jump over a"
1539,ON BARKING DOGS.,"fence ten rails high, shoot an arrow from his bow twenty rods, and"
1540,ON BARKING DOGS.,hit an apple at that distance half a dozen times running.
1541,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1542,ON BARKING DOGS.,I must tell you a story about this Tom Thrasher. Poor Tom! he got
1543,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""come up with,"" not long ago, by some fun-loving boys that lived in"
1544,ON BARKING DOGS.,his neighborhood. Tom had been boasting of his great feats in jumping.
1545,ON BARKING DOGS.,"He could jump higher than any boy on Blue Hill. In fact, he had just"
1546,ON BARKING DOGS.,"jumped over the fence around Captain Corning's goat pasture, which, as"
1547,ON BARKING DOGS.,"everybody knows, was eight rails high, and verily believed he could"
1548,ON BARKING DOGS.,"have cleared it just as easily, if it had been two rails higher. That"
1549,ON BARKING DOGS.,was the kind of language he used to this company of boys. They did not
1550,ON BARKING DOGS.,believe a word he said.
1551,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1552,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Let's try Tom,"" one whispered to another, ""let's try the fellow, and"
1553,ON BARKING DOGS.,"see how high he can jump."""
1554,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1555,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Say, Tom,"" said one of the boys, ""will you go down to the captain's"
1556,ON BARKING DOGS.,"goat pasture with us, and try that thing over again?"""
1557,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1558,ON BARKING DOGS.,Tom did not seem to be very fierce for going. But all the boys urged
1559,ON BARKING DOGS.,"him so hard, that he finally consented and went. When he got to the"
1560,ON BARKING DOGS.,"goat pasture, he measured the fence with his eye; and from the manner"
1561,ON BARKING DOGS.,"in which he shrugged his shoulders, it was pretty clear that he"
1562,ON BARKING DOGS.,considered the fence a very high one indeed. He was not at all in a
1563,ON BARKING DOGS.,hurry about performing the feat. But the roguish boys would not let
1564,ON BARKING DOGS.,him off.
1565,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1566,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Come, Tom,"" said one."
1567,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1568,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Now for it,"" said another."
1569,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1570,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""No backing out,"" said a third."
1571,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1572,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""It's only eight rails high,"" said a fourth."
1573,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1574,ON BARKING DOGS.,"Still, somehow or other, Tom could not get his courage quite up to the"
1575,ON BARKING DOGS.,"point. The best thing he could have done, in my way of thinking, when"
1576,ON BARKING DOGS.,"he found himself so completely cornered was to have said, ""Well,"
1577,ON BARKING DOGS.,"boys, there's no use in mincing the matter at all. I am a little"
1578,ON BARKING DOGS.,dunce. I can no more jump over that fence than I can build a steamboat
1579,ON BARKING DOGS.,"or catch a streak of lightning."" But that was not his way of getting"
1580,ON BARKING DOGS.,out of the scrape.
1581,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1582,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Let me give the word now,"" said one of the lads. ""I'll say 'one, two,"
1583,ON BARKING DOGS.,"three,' and when I come to 'three,' you shall run and jump."""
1584,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1585,ON BARKING DOGS.,"""Go ahead,"" said Tom."
1586,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1587,ON BARKING DOGS.,"And the other boy began: ""_One--two--three_""--"
1588,ON BARKING DOGS.,
1589,ON BARKING DOGS.,"Tom started, and ran. I'm not sure but he had boasted so much about"
1590,ON BARKING DOGS.,"his jumping, that he had almost made himself believe he really could"
1591,ON BARKING DOGS.,"jump over that fence. At any rate, he tried it, and--failed, of"
1592,ON BARKING DOGS.,course. His feet struck the fence about three quarters of the distance
1593,ON BARKING DOGS.,"from the ground, and over he went, head foremost, into the goat"
1594,ON BARKING DOGS.,pasture. It was fortunate for him that he did not break his neck. As
1595,ON BARKING DOGS.,"it was, his _spirit_ was broken, and that was about all. He went home"
1596,ON BARKING DOGS.,a much humbler boy than he was when he came to the goat pasture; and a
1597,ON BARKING DOGS.,"somewhat wiser one, too. After that unfortunate leap, if Tom ever"
1598,ON BARKING DOGS.,"boasted largely of what he could do and what he had done, it was a"
1599,ON BARKING DOGS.,"very common thing for his playmates to say, ""Take care, Tom; remember"
