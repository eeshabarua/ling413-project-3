217,THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL,With paper wrapped around each face.
218,THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL,I'm sure they all would suffocate
219,THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL,Or meet some other dreadful fate.
220,THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL,I'd gladly take them on my arm
221,THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL,"And keep them safe from every harm,"

236,THE QUARREL,"And they picked a quarrel that grew and grew,"
237,THE QUARREL,Because they had nothing else to do.
238,THE QUARREL,"Said the dog, ""I really would like to hear"
239,THE QUARREL,"Why you never stir nor frisk nor purr,"
240,THE QUARREL,"But sit like a mummy there."""
241,THE QUARREL,
242,THE QUARREL,"Up spoke in a temper the china puss,"
243,THE QUARREL,Glad of an opening for a fuss:
244,THE QUARREL,"""Dear Mr. Puppy, I can't recall"
245,THE QUARREL,That I ever heard you bark at all.
246,THE QUARREL,"Your bark is a wooden bark, 'tis true,"
247,THE QUARREL,"But as to that,"" said the China Cat,"
248,THE QUARREL,"""My mew is a china mew."""
249,THE QUARREL,
250,THE QUARREL,"So they bristled and quarreled, more and more,"
251,THE QUARREL,Till the baby came creeping across the floor.
252,THE QUARREL,"He took the cat by his whiskers frail,"
253,THE QUARREL,"He grasped the dog by his wooden tail,"
254,THE QUARREL,And banged them together--and after that
255,THE QUARREL,"Left them, a wiser Wooden Dog"
256,THE QUARREL,And a sadder China Cat.
257,THE QUARREL,
258,THE QUARREL,"Now, children, just between you and me,"

287,MY PLAYMATES,"She asks, ""What shall we play?"""

1808,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Leap and laugh and race and run
1809,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Like a child that's full of fun!--
1810,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,"Crinkle, crinkle through the meadows,"
1811,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Hiding in the woodland shadows;
1812,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Making here and there a pool
1813,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,In some leafy covert cool
1814,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,For the Lady Birch to see
1815,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Just how fair and sweet is she.
1816,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,
1817,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Can you guess where I have been?
1818,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,By a brook where willows lean;
1819,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,"With a book whereon to look,"
1820,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,"In some little shady nook,"
1821,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,If that I should weary grow
1822,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Of that lovelier book I know
1823,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Whose sweet leaves the wind is turning--
1824,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Full of lessons for my learning.
1825,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,There are little songs to hear
1826,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,If you bend a listening ear;
1827,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,And no printed book can be
1828,A SUMMER HOLIDAY,Half so dear and sweet to me.

1835,TWO POCKETS,There are two bulging pockets that I have in mind.
1836,TWO POCKETS,Just listen and see if the owners you'll find.
1837,TWO POCKETS,"In one--it's quite shocking--there's a round wad of gum,"
1838,TWO POCKETS,"A china doll's head and a half finished sum,"
1839,TWO POCKETS,"A thimble, a handkerchief--sticky, I fear--"
1840,TWO POCKETS,A dolly's blue cap and some jackstones are here.
1841,TWO POCKETS,"In the other are marbles and fishhooks and strings,"
1842,TWO POCKETS,"Some round shiny stones and a red top that sings,"
1843,TWO POCKETS,"A few apple cores and a tin full of bait,"
1844,TWO POCKETS,A big black jack-knife in a sad bladeless state.
1845,TWO POCKETS,And now I wonder how many can guess
1846,TWO POCKETS,Which pocket Bob owns and which one does Bess?
