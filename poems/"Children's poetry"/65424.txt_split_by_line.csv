54,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,"When in the autumn of 1905, I created the characters of TEDDY-B and"
55,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,TEDDY-G I builded better than I knew. I brought these bears out of their
56,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,mountain den in Colorado and started them on their tour of the East to
57,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,"teach children that animals, even bears, may have some measure of human"
58,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,feeling; that the primary purpose of animals is not necessarily that of
59,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,supplying sport for the hunter. That this lesson has been abundantly
60,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,taught is proven by the overwhelming welcome given the Teddy Bears by
61,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,the boys and girls of the United States; and it is safe to say that the
62,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,traditional “bear will get you” has now and forever lost its frightening
63,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,significance.
64,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,
65,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,This book is a sequel to “The Travels and Adventures of the Roosevelt
66,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,"Bears,” and completes the story of the tour of TEDDY-B and TEDDY-G from"
67,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,Colorado to Washington. The third volume will report in jingle and
68,MORE ABOUT THESE BEARS,picture the tour of the Teddy Bears abroad.

139,NEW YORK,
140,NEW YORK,
141,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
142,NEW YORK,
143,NEW YORK,The Roosevelt Bears were born out West
144,NEW YORK,"In a big ravine near a mountain crest,"
145,NEW YORK,Where they lived as cubs and had such play
146,NEW YORK,As Teddy Bears have every day.
147,NEW YORK,But they learned some things as years went by
148,NEW YORK,"Of cities great and buildings high,"
149,NEW YORK,"And trains that run at rapid speed,"
150,NEW YORK,"And schools which teach folks how to read,"
151,NEW YORK,And circus clowns and phonograph
152,NEW YORK,"And other things which make folks laugh,"
153,NEW YORK,And big hotels where meals they say
154,NEW YORK,Are served in style both night and day.
155,NEW YORK,They had heard of men of great renown
156,NEW YORK,Who lived and died in Boston town;
157,NEW YORK,Of rulers brave and statesmen bold
158,NEW YORK,And millionaires with barrels of gold;
159,NEW YORK,Of men who work just day by day
160,NEW YORK,For boys and girls and daily pay;
161,NEW YORK,And of one they heard who works for fun:
162,NEW YORK,The President at Washington.
163,NEW YORK,
164,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
165,NEW YORK,
166,NEW YORK,These bears some travel books had found
167,NEW YORK,Which told them the world is round.
168,NEW YORK,They made up their minds that they would see
169,NEW YORK,And learn about geography
170,NEW YORK,And visit cities everywhere
171,NEW YORK,And introduce the Teddy Bear.
172,NEW YORK,They found some gold in a cave one day
173,NEW YORK,Which they could use to pay their way.
174,NEW YORK,
175,NEW YORK,[Illustration:
176,NEW YORK,
177,NEW YORK,“_They found some gold in a cave one day._”
178,NEW YORK,]
179,NEW YORK,
180,NEW YORK,So one bright morn they said good-bye
181,NEW YORK,"To cave and creek and mountain high,"
182,NEW YORK,"To an old bobcat with a bandaged knee,"
183,NEW YORK,"To a young cougar and squirrels three,"
184,NEW YORK,"To a big-horn sheep and a mountain deer,"
185,NEW YORK,And to other friends that lived quite near;
186,NEW YORK,And with bags on backs and sticks in hand
187,NEW YORK,They started their tramp across the land.
188,NEW YORK,The black bear’s name was TEDDY-B;
189,NEW YORK,"The B for black or brown, you see."
190,NEW YORK,
191,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
192,NEW YORK,
193,NEW YORK,And TEDDY-G was the gray bear’s name;
194,NEW YORK,The G for gray; but both bears came
195,NEW YORK,For “Teddy” because
196,NEW YORK,Children called them Teddy Bears.
197,NEW YORK,
198,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
199,NEW YORK,
200,NEW YORK,The “Teddy” part is a name they found
201,NEW YORK,"On hat and tree and leggings round,"
202,NEW YORK,"On belt and boot and plates of tin,"
203,NEW YORK,"And scraps of paper and biscuits thin,"
204,NEW YORK,And other things a hunter dropped
205,NEW YORK,At a mountain camp where he had stopped.
206,NEW YORK,
207,NEW YORK,The story tells how these Teddy Bears
208,NEW YORK,"Scattered forever all blues and cares,"
209,NEW YORK,"And made fun and frolic and mischief too,"
210,NEW YORK,And did some tricks for bears quite new;
211,NEW YORK,
212,NEW YORK,"And how some boys, the stories tell,"
213,NEW YORK,Liked these two Teddy Bears so well
214,NEW YORK,That they made a million for the stores to sell:
215,NEW YORK,"Some quite little, for children small,"
216,NEW YORK,And some as big as the bears are tall;
217,NEW YORK,
218,NEW YORK,"The brown ones looking like TEDDY-B,"
219,NEW YORK,And the white as funny as TEDDY-G.

226,NEW YORK,They started their tramp across the land.”
227,NEW YORK,]
228,NEW YORK,
229,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
230,NEW YORK,
231,NEW YORK,The story goes on to tell how far
232,NEW YORK,"These two bears rode in a Pullman car,"
233,NEW YORK,And the tricks they played on folks that night
234,NEW YORK,When the colored porter put out the light;
235,NEW YORK,
236,NEW YORK,And how TEDDY-G wouldn’t sleep upstairs
237,NEW YORK,"“On a shelf,” he said, “too small for bears.”"
238,NEW YORK,He wanted a window; he wanted to see;
239,NEW YORK,And he kept folks awake till half-past three.
240,NEW YORK,
241,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
242,NEW YORK,
243,NEW YORK,And the story tells of other tricks
244,NEW YORK,"In the dining car, and of a mix"
245,NEW YORK,When TEDDY-G pulled a rope on top
246,NEW YORK,And brought the train to a sudden stop;
247,NEW YORK,
248,NEW YORK,And how the two were put off the train
249,NEW YORK,On a Kansas farm in a shower of rain.
250,NEW YORK,The fun they had from that time on
251,NEW YORK,Fills every page of Book Number One.
252,NEW YORK,
253,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
254,NEW YORK,
255,NEW YORK,They started by learning the famous trick
256,NEW YORK,How farmer boys get ahead so quick.
257,NEW YORK,
258,NEW YORK,"But the things they did would take your breath,"
259,NEW YORK,For they scared the farmer half to death.
260,NEW YORK,
261,NEW YORK,"The horses were put at gathering eggs,"
262,NEW YORK,"And pigs walked round on two hind legs,"
263,NEW YORK,And sheep were given the corn to hoe
264,NEW YORK,And potatoes to plant and wheat to sow.
265,NEW YORK,
266,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
267,NEW YORK,
268,NEW YORK,The story tells how an angry bull
269,NEW YORK,Made a pasture field look pretty full
270,NEW YORK,And chased the two bears round a stack
271,NEW YORK,And over the top and down and back.
272,NEW YORK,
273,NEW YORK,"From there to a district school they went,"
274,NEW YORK,"On mischief and education bent,"
275,NEW YORK,"Where things were done by TEDDY-B,"
276,NEW YORK,Who hit the desk and said that he
277,NEW YORK,
278,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
279,NEW YORK,
280,NEW YORK,Would make letters dance and figures fly
281,NEW YORK,And good boys laugh and bad boys cry;
282,NEW YORK,"The questions he gave; and the boys, their look;"
283,NEW YORK,They had never seen them in a book:
284,NEW YORK,
285,NEW YORK,If a camel can go without water a week
286,NEW YORK,How long can he go if he owns a creek?
287,NEW YORK,"And this, to bound the moon and sky,"
288,NEW YORK,And name the capital of by-and-by;
289,NEW YORK,
290,NEW YORK,"And a hundred more as hard and tough,"
291,NEW YORK,Till the children said they had enough;
292,NEW YORK,But when they left the school that day
293,NEW YORK,"The children were happy, the farmers say."
294,NEW YORK,
295,NEW YORK,The story tells how in railway style
296,NEW YORK,They ran an engine for a mile
297,NEW YORK,And spent a day at a county show
298,NEW YORK,And helped the boys to make things go;
299,NEW YORK,How they walked on ropes drawn good and tight
300,NEW YORK,And jumped through hoops and landed right;
301,NEW YORK,
302,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
303,NEW YORK,
304,NEW YORK,And of the ride in an old balloon
305,NEW YORK,Which took them half-way to the moon;
306,NEW YORK,And things that happened in the sky that night
307,NEW YORK,And the way the world went out of sight;
308,NEW YORK,And how they landed in Lincoln Park
309,NEW YORK,"In Chicago town just ’fore dark,"
310,NEW YORK,
311,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
312,NEW YORK,
313,NEW YORK,And the big hotel on a busy street
314,NEW YORK,Where waiters brought them things to eat.
315,NEW YORK,"How they rang for bell boys, just for fun,"
316,NEW YORK,To give them a quarter and see them run;
317,NEW YORK,And the fun they made in vaudeville;
318,NEW YORK,Children are laughing about it still.
319,NEW YORK,
320,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
321,NEW YORK,
322,NEW YORK,And the bargain sale; TEDDY-G got lost;
323,NEW YORK,And the things they bought and what they cost;
324,NEW YORK,"And their trip to Niagara Falls that night,"
325,NEW YORK,"And what they thought of Niagara’s height,"
326,NEW YORK,And the picnic boys and the boating stunt
327,NEW YORK,When they shot the rapids in a punt;
328,NEW YORK,And how the boys made cheering go
329,NEW YORK,When the train pulled out for Buffalo.
330,NEW YORK,
331,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
332,NEW YORK,
333,NEW YORK,The story tells of their further jaunt
334,NEW YORK,And of TEDDY-G at a restaurant;
335,NEW YORK,How he missed his train and lost his mate;
336,NEW YORK,For TEDDY-B had risen late;
337,NEW YORK,And the jolly crowds the bears to greet
338,NEW YORK,To cheer them all along the street
339,NEW YORK,
340,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
341,NEW YORK,
342,NEW YORK,As they rode from station to Common green
343,NEW YORK,In Boston town like king or queen;
344,NEW YORK,And of the home on Beacon Hill
345,NEW YORK,Where Priscilla Alden and her brother Will
346,NEW YORK,Entertained them gladly days and nights
347,NEW YORK,While they were seeing the Boston sights.
348,NEW YORK,
349,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
350,NEW YORK,
351,NEW YORK,But the things they did in Boston town
352,NEW YORK,Are done in picture and written down
353,NEW YORK,"In Volume One by Teddy’s paw,"
354,NEW YORK,The jolliest book you ever saw.
355,NEW YORK,It tells how they captured Bunker Hill
356,NEW YORK,And worked like soldiers with stubborn will;
357,NEW YORK,And how they got lost in Boston squares
358,NEW YORK,Where criss-cross streets run everywheres;
359,NEW YORK,
360,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
361,NEW YORK,
362,NEW YORK,And the time they had at Plymouth Rock
363,NEW YORK,When trying to make forefathers talk;
364,NEW YORK,And the auto ride to Lexington
365,NEW YORK,"Which nearly cost them all their fun,"
366,NEW YORK,For TEDDY-G would chauffeur be
367,NEW YORK,And he ran that car like sixty-three;
368,NEW YORK,It didn’t run; he made it sail
369,NEW YORK,And landed himself and his mate in jail.
370,NEW YORK,
371,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
372,NEW YORK,
373,NEW YORK,"The story tells of their Harvard tricks,"
374,NEW YORK,Where they got themselves in another mix
375,NEW YORK,"In getting degrees, a double-L-D,"
376,NEW YORK,Which didn’t fit well on TEDDY-G;
377,NEW YORK,"It tells about the talking machine,"
378,NEW YORK,The funniest thing they had ever seen;
379,NEW YORK,
380,NEW YORK,How they danced a two-step and sang as well
381,NEW YORK,And heard Uncle Josh his stories tell;
382,NEW YORK,It tells of the time when they went to see
383,NEW YORK,Where the Boston patriots made good tea
384,NEW YORK,In seventeen hundred and sixty-three;
385,NEW YORK,
386,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
387,NEW YORK,
388,NEW YORK,"And then of their sail in a little skiff,"
389,NEW YORK,And how a storm hit them a biff
390,NEW YORK,"And sent them out on the ocean wide,"
391,NEW YORK,Half-way across to the other side;
392,NEW YORK,And how at noon there came in sight
393,NEW YORK,A tower of ice all glistening white;
394,NEW YORK,
395,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
396,NEW YORK,
397,NEW YORK,"And how they met away out, there"
398,NEW YORK,On this iceberg white a polar bear;
399,NEW YORK,And the stories he told of a northern pole
400,NEW YORK,"Which was never seen by a living soul,"
401,NEW YORK,"But it carried a flag both night and day,"
402,NEW YORK,The stars and stripes of the U. S. A.;
403,NEW YORK,
404,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
405,NEW YORK,
406,NEW YORK,And the story tells of the rescue made
407,NEW YORK,And how the steamer crowds hurrahed
408,NEW YORK,As “Yankee Doodle” the brass band played;
409,NEW YORK,"And then it tells, this jolly book,"
410,NEW YORK,How reporters met them at Sandy Hook
411,NEW YORK,And asked them questions and pictures took;
412,NEW YORK,"And of New York and its buildings high,"
413,NEW YORK,"And how the bears made money fly,"
414,NEW YORK,"And dressed in style to see the town,"
415,NEW YORK,To do Fifth Avenue up and down;
416,NEW YORK,
417,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
418,NEW YORK,
419,NEW YORK,"And the guide they hired, wee Muddy Pete,"
420,NEW YORK,"A lad whose home was on the street,"
421,NEW YORK,"And his little dog, a terrier white,"
422,NEW YORK,Pete’s boon companion day and night.
423,NEW YORK,The story tells of the circus show
424,NEW YORK,Where the two bears helped to make things go;
425,NEW YORK,
426,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
427,NEW YORK,
428,NEW YORK,How like heroes of a hundred fights
429,NEW YORK,The Roosevelt Bears in colored tights
430,NEW YORK,"Stepped in the ring to dance or sing,"
431,NEW YORK,To ride or tumble or anything.
432,NEW YORK,
433,NEW YORK,So these Teddy Bears are here to stay:
434,NEW YORK,They came from the West one summer’s day
435,NEW YORK,And journeyed East from town to town
436,NEW YORK,And gathered fame and much renown.
437,NEW YORK,
438,NEW YORK,[Illustration]
439,NEW YORK,
440,NEW YORK,Book Number One (boys know it well)
441,NEW YORK,The pictures show and the stories tell
442,NEW YORK,Of how they crossed the U. S. A.
443,NEW YORK,(And made folks laugh both night and day)
444,NEW YORK,"To New York City, there to be told"
445,NEW YORK,That Teddy Bears in the shops were sold.
446,NEW YORK,But the bears in the shops are only toys
447,NEW YORK,Made to please good girls and boys.
448,NEW YORK,"These Roosevelt Bears, TEDDIES-B and G,"
449,NEW YORK,Are as full of mischief as you or me;
450,NEW YORK,They laugh and talk and sleep and eat
451,NEW YORK,And go around on two hind feet
452,NEW YORK,And ride on cars and wear good clothes;
453,NEW YORK,"And the things they do, dear only knows,"
454,NEW YORK,For they read from books and music play
455,NEW YORK,And lose themselves nearly every day.
456,NEW YORK,But the story here and these pictures new
457,NEW YORK,Tell things about them just as true
458,NEW YORK,"As the things that happened, children say,"
459,NEW YORK,From West to East along the way.

510,FIRE,And tumbled off a dozen feet
511,FIRE,From the trolley top down to the street.
512,FIRE,
513,FIRE,[Illustration]
514,FIRE,
515,FIRE,The car was stopped; TEDDY-B got out
516,FIRE,To see what the trouble was all about;
517,FIRE,The conductor gave expert advice;
518,FIRE,Muddy Pete replied with words not nice;
519,FIRE,While Cribs stood round as if to say
520,FIRE,“Let us try it again some other day.”
521,FIRE,"“The thing that struck me,” said TEDDY-G,"
522,FIRE,As he walked to the curb on hand and knee.
523,FIRE,
524,FIRE,"“Struck me all over, outside and in,"
525,FIRE,"At every place like a prodding pin,"
526,FIRE,And burned like fire and did all so quick
527,FIRE,I hadn’t time to learn the trick.”
528,FIRE,"“Let the car go on,” said TEDDY-B,"
529,FIRE,“We’ll stay right here this town to see
530,FIRE,"And get some lunch and look around,"
531,FIRE,"And walk up that hill to that college ground,"
532,FIRE,And climb that pole on the public square
533,FIRE,And show the children playing there
534,FIRE,That the Roosevelt Bears have been to school
535,FIRE,And know A B C by rote and rule.”
536,FIRE,
537,FIRE,[Illustration]
538,FIRE,
539,FIRE,"“You may go yourself,” said TEDDY-G,"
540,FIRE,"“And see the town, but as for me,"
541,FIRE,I climbed one pole to-day before
542,FIRE,And it left my bones a trifle sore.
543,FIRE,I’ll stay right here and rest a bit
544,FIRE,The several places where I got hit.”
545,FIRE,While thus they talked Muddy Pete and Cribs
546,FIRE,Went off to buy some roasted ribs
547,FIRE,And fried potatoes and muffins hot
548,FIRE,And three cups of coffee in a pot.
549,FIRE,
550,FIRE,"As they ate their lunch they heard a ring,"
551,FIRE,Both quick and loud: ding! ding! ding! ding!
552,FIRE,"“A fire! fire!” cried Muddy Pete,"
553,FIRE,And off the four ran down the street.
554,FIRE,TEDDY-G forgot about electricity
555,FIRE,And ran as fast as TEDDY-B.
556,FIRE,
557,FIRE,They found the fire in a dry goods store
558,FIRE,And making its way towards three or four
559,FIRE,Of the largest shops on the busiest street:
560,FIRE,"A clothing house and a store with meat,"
561,FIRE,
562,FIRE,And a great big grocery on the right
563,FIRE,And not a fireman yet in sight.
564,FIRE,The firemen’s hall was across the street
565,FIRE,And in half a minute Captain Muddy Pete
566,FIRE,
567,FIRE,[Illustration]
568,FIRE,
569,FIRE,Had told some boys that the job was theirs
570,FIRE,And had given orders to the Roosevelt Bears
571,FIRE,
572,FIRE,"About the wagons and reel and hose,"
573,FIRE,And hooks and ladders and firemen’s clothes.

583,FIRE,Boost out the reel; get busy quick;
584,FIRE,
585,FIRE,Hitch up that rubber to that spouter there;
586,FIRE,Twist round the stopper and let ’er tear.
587,FIRE,"Hang on to that nozzle, you TEDDY-G,"

597,FIRE,The water struck the fire and smoke.
598,FIRE,In sixty seconds the Roosevelt team

617,_TEDDY-G._,
618,_TEDDY-G._,They saved two boys from the highest floor
619,_TEDDY-G._,Who were in a room and had locked the door.
620,_TEDDY-G._,"The wind was blowing both hard and high,"
621,_TEDDY-G._,And it carried fire to roofs near-by.

623,_TEDDY-G._,TEDDY-G was ordered by Muddy Pete

641,_TEDDY-B._,And offered them cash which they wouldn’t take.
642,_TEDDY-B._,
643,_TEDDY-B._,"He ordered a carriage with coachman swell,"

788,WAX MUSEE,’Twas three o’clock when they left to see

790,WAX MUSEE,
791,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
792,WAX MUSEE,
793,WAX MUSEE,They found Buster Brown in the entrance hall
794,WAX MUSEE,And a cat climbing up the building wall
795,WAX MUSEE,With Tige below looking up at puss
796,WAX MUSEE,And Buster’s mother trying to stop the fuss.
797,WAX MUSEE,"“Good afternoon,” said TEDDY-B,"
798,WAX MUSEE,“Is this Buster Brown and Tige I see?”

805,WAX MUSEE,TEDDY-B and G! How do you do!
806,WAX MUSEE,You’re the jolliest bears I ever saw.”
807,WAX MUSEE,And Buster shook each by the paw
808,WAX MUSEE,While Tige seemed glad that he was near
809,WAX MUSEE,And put on a smile from ear to ear.
810,WAX MUSEE,
811,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
812,WAX MUSEE,
813,WAX MUSEE,"“You come with us,” said Buster Brown,"
814,WAX MUSEE,"“We know this place, upstairs and down;"

816,WAX MUSEE,Who haven’t changed for a hundred years.

820,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
821,WAX MUSEE,
822,WAX MUSEE,But Buster’s mother made him stay
823,WAX MUSEE,Right where he was in wax and clay;
824,WAX MUSEE,And Tige looked round for a place to hide

826,WAX MUSEE,
827,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
828,WAX MUSEE,
829,WAX MUSEE,They saw the eagle which stole the child
830,WAX MUSEE,And carried it up in the mountains wild.
831,WAX MUSEE,They stopped for a moment to see the King
832,WAX MUSEE,And to ask Madame Patti if she would sing.

834,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
835,WAX MUSEE,
836,WAX MUSEE,"They saw Emperor William in a soldier suit,"

839,WAX MUSEE,Turned the tails of his moustache the other way.
840,WAX MUSEE,
841,WAX MUSEE,"At the Roman Forum, TEDDY-B spoke out"
842,WAX MUSEE,And asked Mark Antony what ’twas all about:
843,WAX MUSEE,This Roman crowd and Cæsar slain
844,WAX MUSEE,And why they were doing the thing again.
845,WAX MUSEE,
846,WAX MUSEE,And thus they went from place to place
847,WAX MUSEE,Looking at people of every race
848,WAX MUSEE,And crimes committed and prisoners hung
849,WAX MUSEE,And no complaint from any tongue.
850,WAX MUSEE,
851,WAX MUSEE,[Illustration]
852,WAX MUSEE,
853,WAX MUSEE,At the lions’ den TEDDY-G was wild;
854,WAX MUSEE,A lion had killed a little child:
855,WAX MUSEE,“I’ll go right in and smash his face.”
856,WAX MUSEE,But a man who was there to guard the place
857,WAX MUSEE,
858,WAX MUSEE,"Spoke up and said, “That lion in there"
859,WAX MUSEE,Is not afraid of a Roosevelt Bear;
860,WAX MUSEE,
861,WAX MUSEE,"He’s made of wax, and that savage look"
862,WAX MUSEE,He wears all the time like a picture book.”
863,WAX MUSEE,
864,WAX MUSEE,"But TEDDY-G replied that he,"
865,WAX MUSEE,"If he owned the place, would let folks see"
866,WAX MUSEE,That lions who did such things as they
867,WAX MUSEE,Shouldn’t live at all in wax or clay.
868,WAX MUSEE,
869,WAX MUSEE,Then on they went upstairs to guess
870,WAX MUSEE,How Ajab played his game of chess.
871,WAX MUSEE,
872,WAX MUSEE,"Said TEDDY-G, “See if you can"
873,WAX MUSEE,Play checkers with this wooden man;
874,WAX MUSEE,And while you play I’ll take off the lid
875,WAX MUSEE,And find out where the man is hid.”

882,WAX MUSEE,

886,WAX MUSEE,The first time in a hundred years.
887,WAX MUSEE,
888,WAX MUSEE,"TEDDY-G looked at him from head to heels,"
889,WAX MUSEE,"And his side door opened to see the wheels,"
890,WAX MUSEE,And the man’s mainspring and his wooden heart
891,WAX MUSEE,"He examined with care and took apart,"
892,WAX MUSEE,But he couldn’t find out high or low
893,WAX MUSEE,How this man of wood made the checkers go.
894,WAX MUSEE,
895,WAX MUSEE,TEDDY-B was polite and said “Good-bye;”
896,WAX MUSEE,"And the man got up and wiped his eye,"
897,WAX MUSEE,"And held out his hand as well ’s he could,"

906,WAX MUSEE,
907,WAX MUSEE,"“Resolved, _That mothers should never scold,"

958,WEST POINT,The day was fine and the Bears were free
959,WEST POINT,To take a River boat to see
960,WEST POINT,The Palisades and Tarrytown
961,WEST POINT,And to view the Hudson up and down.
962,WEST POINT,
963,WEST POINT,[Illustration]
964,WEST POINT,
965,WEST POINT,A request had come from a young cadet
966,WEST POINT,"Of West Point school, whom the Bears had met,"
967,WEST POINT,"To dine at the West Point Army Mess,"
968,WEST POINT,"And to see the boys in their army dress,"
969,WEST POINT,"And to sleep on an army barracks cot,"
970,WEST POINT,"And to try their luck at a target shot,"
971,WEST POINT,
972,WEST POINT,"And to ride bare-backed in the hurdle shute,"
973,WEST POINT,"Or to join a band with drum and flute,"
974,WEST POINT,Or to hear good stories of army fights
975,WEST POINT,After taps are sounded to put out the lights.
976,WEST POINT,So they sent a wire to the cadet to say
977,WEST POINT,That they would call that very day.

983,WEST POINT,]
984,WEST POINT,
985,WEST POINT,They made the trip with but one mishap:
986,WEST POINT,The wind blew off a newsboy’s cap
987,WEST POINT,As he walked around on the steamer deck
988,WEST POINT,Calling out the news of a railway wreck
989,WEST POINT,And selling his papers and chewing gum
990,WEST POINT,To the crowd of tourists “going some.”
991,WEST POINT,
992,WEST POINT,[Illustration]
993,WEST POINT,
994,WEST POINT,TEDDY-G made a jump as he saw it go
995,WEST POINT,And he and the cap went down below.
996,WEST POINT,Like a diver he struck the water right
997,WEST POINT,And quick as a wink was out of sight.
998,WEST POINT,
999,WEST POINT,"“Man’s overboard,” was called aloud;"
1000,WEST POINT,And a cheer went up from the tourist crowd
1001,WEST POINT,As they saw in the water in a little while
1002,WEST POINT,The face of a bear with a pleasant smile.
1003,WEST POINT,
1004,WEST POINT,"The boat was stopped and a rope thrown out,"
1005,WEST POINT,And in answer to the captain’s shout
1006,WEST POINT,"TEDDY-G called back, “The water’s fine;"
1007,WEST POINT,I’ve got the bait; pull in your line.”

1026,WEST POINT,"TEDDY-G on board, all dripping wet;"
1027,WEST POINT,"The children laughed, he looked so queer,"
1028,WEST POINT,With the newsboy’s cap hung on his ear.
1029,WEST POINT,He bowed to tourists left and right
1030,WEST POINT,And said something about his appetite.
1031,WEST POINT,He asked the steward to bring on some meals
1032,WEST POINT,As the steamer band played “Silver Heels.”

1042,WEST POINT,At West Point landing the Bears were met
1043,WEST POINT,By a double carriage with the young cadet
1044,WEST POINT,And a cavalry mount to escort them round
1045,WEST POINT,To see the buildings on the ground.
1046,WEST POINT,"They drove about for an hour or less,"
1047,WEST POINT,Then went to their barrack rooms to dress
1048,WEST POINT,In soldier suits for the evening mess.
1049,WEST POINT,TEDDY-B said he’d be Colonel’s aide
1050,WEST POINT,"And inspect the boys on dress parade,"
1051,WEST POINT,While TEDDY-G said he’d march or stand
1052,WEST POINT,As leader of the soldier band.
1053,WEST POINT,
1054,WEST POINT,"The parade dismissed and the supper through,"
1055,WEST POINT,The Bears had nothing else to do
1056,WEST POINT,But to roll themselves in barrack wraps
1057,WEST POINT,And to put out the lights at the sound of taps.
1058,WEST POINT,
1059,WEST POINT,[Illustration]
1060,WEST POINT,
1061,WEST POINT,At reveille at six next day
1062,WEST POINT,They were wide awake and bright and gay
1063,WEST POINT,And dressed and ready for hours of fun
1064,WEST POINT,With cavalry horse or battery gun.
1065,WEST POINT,
1066,WEST POINT,The boys had fun when TEDDY-B
1067,WEST POINT,Rode a cavalry horse down a shute to see
1068,WEST POINT,How to jump the walls and the hurdles take
1069,WEST POINT,Without a tumble or balk or break.
1070,WEST POINT,
1071,WEST POINT,"The horse was tricky, but the Bear was game"
1072,WEST POINT,"And he made him clear each thing that came,"
1073,WEST POINT,Whether wall or water or brush or bar.
1074,WEST POINT,TEDDY-B would have tried a railway car
1075,WEST POINT,
1076,WEST POINT,Or a barn or a tree or a load of hay
1077,WEST POINT,Or any old thing that came in his way.
1078,WEST POINT,"The finest riding, the officers say,"
1079,WEST POINT,That was done at West Point for many a day.
1080,WEST POINT,
1081,WEST POINT,[Illustration]
1082,WEST POINT,
1083,WEST POINT,TEDDY-G took his turn at soldier fun
1084,WEST POINT,When he loaded and fired a battery gun.
1085,WEST POINT,He charged in powder and cannon ball;
1086,WEST POINT,"“So simple,” he said, “it’s nothing at all.”"
1087,WEST POINT,
1088,WEST POINT,He asked a cadet his hat to keep
1089,WEST POINT,Till he stepped to the muzzle to take a peep
1090,WEST POINT,"To see if the ball was in all right,"
1091,WEST POINT,And if things in front were out of sight.
1092,WEST POINT,"What happened next no one can tell,"
1093,WEST POINT,TEDDY-G was lifted in air a spell
1094,WEST POINT,
1095,WEST POINT,[Illustration]
1096,WEST POINT,
1097,WEST POINT,And whirled around so quick in space
1098,WEST POINT,He didn’t remember just what took place.
1099,WEST POINT,"“I caught that ball, all right,” said he,"
1100,WEST POINT,When the officer questioned TEDDY-G;
1101,WEST POINT,
1102,WEST POINT,“But I don’t like catching balls like that;
1103,WEST POINT,My place I think is at the bat.
1104,WEST POINT,Next time you pitch don’t throw so quick;
1105,WEST POINT,You struck me like a load of brick.”
1106,WEST POINT,
1107,WEST POINT,"Said the officer, “For bravery shown"
1108,WEST POINT,We’ll give you a title all your own;
1109,WEST POINT,You can drop your Harvard L and D
1110,WEST POINT,And be known as Colonel TEDDY-G.”
1111,WEST POINT,
1112,WEST POINT,The boys got out the fife and drum
1113,WEST POINT,And made things all around them hum
1114,WEST POINT,As they marched ahead of the Roosevelt Bears
1115,WEST POINT,In army step down the flight of stairs
1116,WEST POINT,
1117,WEST POINT,To take the ferry at half-past four
1118,WEST POINT,"Across the river to the other shore,"
1119,WEST POINT,Where a train was waiting to take them down
1120,WEST POINT,The eastern bank and back to town.
1121,WEST POINT,
1122,WEST POINT,"“Let us go to-morrow,” said TEDDY-G,"
1123,WEST POINT,“And a first-class game of baseball see;
1124,WEST POINT,That ball they pitched at West Point school
1125,WEST POINT,Had hardly time enough to cool;
1126,WEST POINT,It struck my paws so fiery hot
1127,WEST POINT,I thought for a minute that I was shot.”

1143,BASE BALL,To go with him to an East Side street
1144,BASE BALL,To visit children who never see
1145,BASE BALL,Either grass or field or flower or tree.
1146,BASE BALL,They loaded up like old Saint Nick
1147,BASE BALL,With bundles piled on high and thick;
1148,BASE BALL,Bouquets of flowers for children sick
1149,BASE BALL,"And toys and candy for those at play,"
1150,BASE BALL,"And a hundred other things, folks say,"
1151,BASE BALL,Who saw them on the street that day.
1152,BASE BALL,
1153,BASE BALL,"They went around from door to door,"
1154,BASE BALL,Where bears had never been before;
1155,BASE BALL,Climbed flights of stairs and bumped their heads
1156,BASE BALL,To cheer up lads who were sick in beds;
1157,BASE BALL,"Threw bouquets into windows high,"
1158,BASE BALL,"And picked nice toys and let them fly,"
1159,BASE BALL,"And candy boxes and twigs of green,"

1175,BASE BALL,
1176,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1177,BASE BALL,
1178,BASE BALL,But the jolliest sport of the day began
1179,BASE BALL,When they met an organ-grinder man
1180,BASE BALL,With a monkey trained to act the clown
1181,BASE BALL,And pick up pennies boys throw down.
1182,BASE BALL,TEDDY-G asked the man if he could go
1183,BASE BALL,With his monkey band for an hour or so;
1184,BASE BALL,TEDDY-B said he the troupe would join
1185,BASE BALL,And see that rich folks shelled out coin.
1186,BASE BALL,
1187,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1188,BASE BALL,
1189,BASE BALL,He’d give the monkey double pay:
1190,BASE BALL,Five cents an hour for half a day.
1191,BASE BALL,"And the organ man may go, said they,"
1192,BASE BALL,And join some other kind of play.
1193,BASE BALL,"“Or if you’re tired,” the two Bears said,"
1194,BASE BALL,“Go home for the day and go to bed;
1195,BASE BALL,We’ll use your organ and monkey clown
1196,BASE BALL,And pay you half a dollar down
1197,BASE BALL,And two dollars more when we are through
1198,BASE BALL,And return your band as good as new.

1200,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1201,BASE BALL,
1202,BASE BALL,With help from Cribs and Muddy Pete

1204,BASE BALL,"This bargain made, the Bears set out"
1205,BASE BALL,To give the children round about
1206,BASE BALL,And old folks too along the street
1207,BASE BALL,The funniest kind of music treat.

1213,BASE BALL,And polkas gallop and waltzes race
1214,BASE BALL,And street-songs step at a lively pace.
1215,BASE BALL,While TEDDY-B climbed up on top
1216,BASE BALL,Of the music-box stood on its prop
1217,BASE BALL,And threw the monkey and made him yell

1227,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1228,BASE BALL,
1229,BASE BALL,The crowd of children filled the square;
1230,BASE BALL,Five hundred boys and girls were there;
1231,BASE BALL,And scores of men stopped work to see
1232,BASE BALL,The tricks of TEDDIES-B and G
1233,BASE BALL,Nickels enough and quarters too
1234,BASE BALL,"And silver dollars, not a few,"
1235,BASE BALL,
1236,BASE BALL,Were collected that day by the players four
1237,BASE BALL,To give a fresh air week down by the shore
1238,BASE BALL,To boys and girls a score or more
1239,BASE BALL,Who had never seen the sea before.
1240,BASE BALL,
1241,BASE BALL,The afternoon was good and hot
1242,BASE BALL,And the Bears sat down in a vacant lot
1243,BASE BALL,To count their cash and rest their feet
1244,BASE BALL,And eat some lunch with Muddy Pete.
1245,BASE BALL,
1246,BASE BALL,They returned to the organ-grinder man
1247,BASE BALL,His music-box and collection can
1248,BASE BALL,"And his monkey clown and some money too,"
1249,BASE BALL,Just as he bargained they should do.
1250,BASE BALL,
1251,BASE BALL,They gave the monkey an extra dime
1252,BASE BALL,"For working two hours over time,"
1253,BASE BALL,"And a box of nuts as a special treat,"

1259,BASE BALL,With bags of sand and ball and bat

1261,BASE BALL,And asked if they the Bears could hire.
1262,BASE BALL,

1265,BASE BALL,"“We’re going to play,” a lad spoke up,"

1268,BASE BALL,But they couldn’t come to the game to-day.”
1269,BASE BALL,
1270,BASE BALL,"“And the Bowery nine,” another said,"
1271,BASE BALL,"“Are bigger boys by half-a-head,"
1272,BASE BALL,And good at bat and quick to run;
1273,BASE BALL,They beat us last time two to one.”
1274,BASE BALL,
1275,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1276,BASE BALL,
1277,BASE BALL,"“They don’t play fair,” said another lad,"
1278,BASE BALL,“They count all balls both good and bad;
1279,BASE BALL,They claimed a foul when I made a base
1280,BASE BALL,And when I objected they slapped my face.”
1281,BASE BALL,
1282,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1283,BASE BALL,
1284,BASE BALL,"“The Bowery nine,” said TEDDY-B,"

1287,BASE BALL,And win that silver cup just the same.”
1288,BASE BALL,
1289,BASE BALL,"“Give me some pointers,” said TEDDY-G,"
1290,BASE BALL,“This game you play is new to me.”
1291,BASE BALL,The Bears were coached in every rule
1292,BASE BALL,And they both caught on like boys at school.
1293,BASE BALL,
1294,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1295,BASE BALL,
1296,BASE BALL,"The Bowery boys, in a little while,"
1297,BASE BALL,Came on the lot in baseball style.
1298,BASE BALL,They read off rules to the other nine
1299,BASE BALL,And helped lay out the diamond line.
1300,BASE BALL,
1301,BASE BALL,"In size, they said, among themselves,"
1302,BASE BALL,These Roosevelt Bears are number twelves;
1303,BASE BALL,But the Bowery captain bet his hat
1304,BASE BALL,That neither Bear could pitch or bat.
1305,BASE BALL,
1306,BASE BALL,"“This game,” he said, “is as good as won;"
1307,BASE BALL,We’ll beat those fellows ten to one.”
1308,BASE BALL,

1310,BASE BALL,
1311,BASE BALL,A Bowery boy went to the bat
1312,BASE BALL,While the other eight on some lumber sat
1313,BASE BALL,To watch the play and wait their turn
1314,BASE BALL,And see the Bears their fingers burn.
1315,BASE BALL,
1316,BASE BALL,TEDDY-B as catcher in mask and pad
1317,BASE BALL,Met every ball both good and bad
1318,BASE BALL,"With snap and skill so sure and quick,"
1319,BASE BALL,He seemed to know the baseball trick;
1320,BASE BALL,
1321,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1322,BASE BALL,
1323,BASE BALL,While TEDDY-G at the pitcher’s box
1324,BASE BALL,Put balls to bat like hammer knocks
1325,BASE BALL,
1326,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1327,BASE BALL,
1328,BASE BALL,And with curves so neat and twists so new
1329,BASE BALL,The fielders hadn’t a thing to do;
1330,BASE BALL,For not a boy could make a hit
1331,BASE BALL,And one by one the plate they quit.
1332,BASE BALL,"Said Muddy Pete, “Their cake is dough”"
1333,BASE BALL,"As he marked the score, a great big O."
1334,BASE BALL,"“It’s our turn now,” said TEDDY-B,"
1335,BASE BALL,“We’ll let those Bowery fellows see
1336,BASE BALL,That the team that wins this game to-day
1337,BASE BALL,Will make their score by honest play.”
1338,BASE BALL,And of all the batting that was ever done
1339,BASE BALL,"In games that lost or in games that won,"
1340,BASE BALL,"In timing hits and in making base,"
1341,BASE BALL,"And in running home in the wildest race,"
1342,BASE BALL,This play that day of the Roosevelt Bears
1343,BASE BALL,Beat baseball records everywheres.
1344,BASE BALL,
1345,BASE BALL,They knocked that ball so hard and high
1346,BASE BALL,"Above the clouds up in the sky,"
1347,BASE BALL,That while it tarried out of sight
1348,BASE BALL,The Bears went round with all their might
1349,BASE BALL,
1350,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1351,BASE BALL,
1352,BASE BALL,And scored so fast for that silver cup
1353,BASE BALL,That Muddy Pete could scarce keep up.
1354,BASE BALL,"Nine innings each they didn’t get,"
1355,BASE BALL,For the Roosevelt Bears would be batting yet
1356,BASE BALL,If the Bowery boys hadn’t stopped the score
1357,BASE BALL,At naught for them to sixty-four.

1369,BASE BALL,
1370,BASE BALL,The Bears went out to a country place
1371,BASE BALL,To see a machine take its trial race;
1372,BASE BALL,Invented by a New Jersey man
1373,BASE BALL,And made to fly on a novel plan.
1374,BASE BALL,
1375,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1376,BASE BALL,
1377,BASE BALL,This trial trip was to prove that day
1378,BASE BALL,That machines that fly have come to stay.
1379,BASE BALL,When the hour arrived to cut the cord
1380,BASE BALL,There wasn’t a man who would go aboard.
1381,BASE BALL,The Bears said they would make the trip
1382,BASE BALL,And every racing record whip
1383,BASE BALL,If they only knew how to steer the ship.
1384,BASE BALL,"“We’ve sailed before,” said TEDDY-B,"
1385,BASE BALL,“We hit Chicago down a tree
1386,BASE BALL,From an old balloon that brought us there
1387,BASE BALL,From a Missouri town at a county fair.”
1388,BASE BALL,"“I’m not afraid,” said TEDDY-G,"
1389,BASE BALL,“I’d like to go to the moon to see
1390,BASE BALL,If the man up there charges entrance fees
1391,BASE BALL,And what he does with all the cheese.”
1392,BASE BALL,
1393,BASE BALL,But as they talked the machine got wise
1394,BASE BALL,And with buzz and whiz it began to rise
1395,BASE BALL,And broke the ropes that held it tight
1396,BASE BALL,And went towards the clouds and out of sight
1397,BASE BALL,With TEDDY-B and TEDDY-G
1398,BASE BALL,Grabbing at anything they could see:
1399,BASE BALL,
1400,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1401,BASE BALL,
1402,BASE BALL,The one on a bar beneath the sail
1403,BASE BALL,And the other on a rope to make a tail.
1404,BASE BALL,They started so quick and went so high
1405,BASE BALL,They hadn’t a chance to say good-bye.
1406,BASE BALL,
1407,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1408,BASE BALL,
1409,BASE BALL,"They had ridden before and lively too,"
1410,BASE BALL,On cow-boy horses and in frail canoe;

1424,BASE BALL,They went over town and farm and creek
1425,BASE BALL,"In one straight line like a lightning streak,"
1426,BASE BALL,And it wasn’t forty minutes when
1427,BASE BALL,They came in sight of William Penn
1428,BASE BALL,Looking so wise and straight and tall
1429,BASE BALL,On the top of Philadelphia’s city hall.
1430,BASE BALL,"TEDDY-B called out from where he sat,"
1431,BASE BALL,“There’s a man ahead; I see his hat;
1432,BASE BALL,His hand is out; he means to try
1433,BASE BALL,To catch the rope as we go by.”
1434,BASE BALL,And TEDDY-G in cow-boy style
1435,BASE BALL,"Let out the rope, nearly half a mile,"
1436,BASE BALL,And as it coiled he pulled with might
1437,BASE BALL,And William Penn he lassoed tight.
1438,BASE BALL,A crowd of children down below
1439,BASE BALL,Looked up and saw the Bears let go
1440,BASE BALL,"And come from the clouds like sailors bold,"
1441,BASE BALL,"With not a thing but the rope to hold,"
1442,BASE BALL,
1443,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1444,BASE BALL,
1445,BASE BALL,[Illustration:
1446,BASE BALL,
1447,BASE BALL,"“_They came from the clouds like sailors bold, with not a thing but"
1448,BASE BALL,the rope to hold._”
1449,BASE BALL,]
1450,BASE BALL,
1451,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1452,BASE BALL,
1453,BASE BALL,"And land all right on the old man’s hat,"
1454,BASE BALL,Where both sat down to have a chat
1455,BASE BALL,And look about and view the town
1456,BASE BALL,And ask each other how they’d get down.
1457,BASE BALL,
1458,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1459,BASE BALL,
1460,BASE BALL,They looked over the brim to see Penn’s face
1461,BASE BALL,And ask him questions about the place:
1462,BASE BALL,
1463,BASE BALL,What would happen if they should fall?
1464,BASE BALL,And how long it took to build the hall?
1465,BASE BALL,
1466,BASE BALL,And what it cost and if he thought it nice
1467,BASE BALL,To pay so much for expert advice?
1468,BASE BALL,
1469,BASE BALL,And one thing sure they’d like to know
1470,BASE BALL,Why this Quaker town was considered slow?
1471,BASE BALL,
1472,BASE BALL,A crowd soon gathered round the square;
1473,BASE BALL,"Police and engineers were there,"
1474,BASE BALL,
1475,BASE BALL,"And business men and children too,"
1476,BASE BALL,And each one wondering what to do;
1477,BASE BALL,For how to get the two Bears down
1478,BASE BALL,Was soon being asked by half the town.
1479,BASE BALL,
1480,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1481,BASE BALL,
1482,BASE BALL,The Mayor came out with megaphone
1483,BASE BALL,And called aloud up the tower of stone
1484,BASE BALL,And promised Father Penn a dime
1485,BASE BALL,If he’d give the Bears a high old time.
1486,BASE BALL,
1487,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1488,BASE BALL,
1489,BASE BALL,Not very far from where they sat
1490,BASE BALL,A door was opened in the Quaker hat
1491,BASE BALL,And a man put out his head to say
1492,BASE BALL,"That the Roosevelt Bears could come that way,"
1493,BASE BALL,But the door was small and it wouldn’t do
1494,BASE BALL,For neither Bear could be crowded through.
1495,BASE BALL,
1496,BASE BALL,"Said TEDDY-B, “Go to the street"
1497,BASE BALL,And bring a rope six hundred feet
1498,BASE BALL,And William here will hold one end
1499,BASE BALL,While we to the square below descend.”
1500,BASE BALL,
1501,BASE BALL,This plan was tried and in half an hour
1502,BASE BALL,The Bears had landed from the tower
1503,BASE BALL,And had shaken hands right then and there
1504,BASE BALL,With every child around the square.
1505,BASE BALL,
1506,BASE BALL,"From there they went, the papers say,"
1507,BASE BALL,"To a Broad Street bank to draw their pay,"
1508,BASE BALL,Or to cash a check which TEDDY-G
1509,BASE BALL,Had got in New York as their circus fee.
1510,BASE BALL,
1511,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1512,BASE BALL,
1513,BASE BALL,When they asked for money the man inside
1514,BASE BALL,"Said, “You’ll have to be identified:"
1515,BASE BALL,"Perhaps your names are what you say,"
1516,BASE BALL,But prove it you must some other way.”
1517,BASE BALL,
1518,BASE BALL,"“Is that check good?” said TEDDY-B,"
1519,BASE BALL,"“Well, if it is, I’ll let you see"
1520,BASE BALL,That G is he and B is me.”
1521,BASE BALL,But before he had time to act the bear
1522,BASE BALL,The check was taken and the cash was there.
1523,BASE BALL,
1524,BASE BALL,To a shop they went on Chestnut Street
1525,BASE BALL,And dressed up new from head to feet
1526,BASE BALL,And got the bill and paid the fee
1527,BASE BALL,And started out the town to see.
1528,BASE BALL,
1529,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1530,BASE BALL,
1531,BASE BALL,Two little lads named Jack and Will
1532,BASE BALL,Had bought four tickets for vaudeville;
1533,BASE BALL,Four seats up front at a children’s show
1534,BASE BALL,That was given to help poor boys to go
1535,BASE BALL,To a training school where men are paid
1536,BASE BALL,To teach young lads a useful trade.
1537,BASE BALL,The boys had heard of the Roosevelt Bears
1538,BASE BALL,And they spent their money for the extra chairs
1539,BASE BALL,That very day on Chestnut Street
1540,BASE BALL,To give the Bears this special treat.
1541,BASE BALL,
1542,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1543,BASE BALL,
1544,BASE BALL,"The boys had followed the Bears a square,"
1545,BASE BALL,Intending to ask if they would care
1546,BASE BALL,To use up their time that day to go
1547,BASE BALL,With two little lads to the children’s show.
1548,BASE BALL,Jack was bravest and walked close behind
1549,BASE BALL,To see if the Bears were really kind.
1550,BASE BALL,"“You speak to TEDDY-B,” said he,"
1551,BASE BALL,“And I’ll put the question to TEDDY-G.”
1552,BASE BALL,"“All right!” said Will, and he stepped ahead"
1553,BASE BALL,And this to TEDDY-B he said:
1554,BASE BALL,
1555,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1556,BASE BALL,
1557,BASE BALL,"“Mr. TEDDY-B, will you come with me"
1558,BASE BALL,Right now a children’s show to see?
1559,BASE BALL,I have your ticket; it’s paid for too;
1560,BASE BALL,I bought it specially for you.”
1561,BASE BALL,"“That was good of you; of course I’ll go,”"
1562,BASE BALL,"Said TEDDY-B, “to the children’s show;"
1563,BASE BALL,We’re here to make the jolliest kind
1564,BASE BALL,Of fun for every child we find.”
1565,BASE BALL,"“Me too,” said Jack; ’twas all he said;"
1566,BASE BALL,His courage wasn’t in his head;
1567,BASE BALL,
1568,BASE BALL,[Illustration:
1569,BASE BALL,
1570,BASE BALL,“_But TEDDY-G to answer Jack lifted him high up on his back._”
1571,BASE BALL,]
1572,BASE BALL,
1573,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1574,BASE BALL,
1575,BASE BALL,But TEDDY-G to answer Jack
1576,BASE BALL,Lifted him high up on his back
1577,BASE BALL,And danced a jig right then and there
1578,BASE BALL,
1579,BASE BALL,To show the crowd that a Roosevelt Bear
1580,BASE BALL,For serious people didn’t care;
1581,BASE BALL,
1582,BASE BALL,They lived for fun and their fun they’d share
1583,BASE BALL,Free of expense and everywhere.
1584,BASE BALL,
1585,BASE BALL,[Illustration]
1586,BASE BALL,
1587,BASE BALL,But the things that happened to Jack and Will
1588,BASE BALL,That afternoon at vaudeville
1589,BASE BALL,
1590,BASE BALL,Were not on the program of the children’s show;
1591,BASE BALL,"For the Roosevelt Bears, folks say who know,"
1592,BASE BALL,
1593,BASE BALL,Made the biggest hit of their lives that day
1594,BASE BALL,And put up an afternoon of play
1595,BASE BALL,The like of which was never seen
1596,BASE BALL,"By old or young, by king or queen."

1607,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1608,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1609,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1610,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1611,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"The theatre chairs were filled with fun,"
1612,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,For a boy or girl was in every one
1613,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Except the four which Jack and Will
1614,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the Roosevelt Bears had come to fill.
1615,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1616,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The band was playing the latest air
1617,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And laughing children everywhere
1618,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,As the Bears walked down the central aisle
1619,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,In their summer suits cut Philadelphia style.
1620,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1621,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,They looked so jolly and smiled so sweet
1622,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,That the children clapped and stamped their feet
1623,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And waved their hands and stood on chairs
1624,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And cried “Hurrah for the Roosevelt Bears!”
1625,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1626,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But the Bears were large and the seats were small
1627,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And they found they couldn’t sit down at all;
1628,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"So they stood in the aisle to view the crowd,"
1629,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And thus spoke TEDDY-B out loud:
1630,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1631,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1632,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1633,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,“Young ladies and gentlemen; children dear;
1634,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And chairman too, if there is one here,"
1635,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1636,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"TEDDY-G and I have come to stay,"
1637,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"To hear you laugh and to see the play,"
1638,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1639,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And since we can’t very well sit down
1640,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"We’ll go on the stage and help the clown,"
1641,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1642,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And stand and sit on wall or floor
1643,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And do some tricks we have done before,"
1644,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And some quite old and some quite new,"
1645,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And keep it up till the show is through.”
1646,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1647,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1648,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1649,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"The children called for TEDDY-G,"
1650,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But he shook his head and said that he
1651,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Could sing a song or dance a jig,"
1652,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Or sit on chairs either small or big,"
1653,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1654,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Or talk to girls or with them dine,"
1655,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But to make a speech wasn’t quite his line.
1656,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1657,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"The speeches through, a theatre page"
1658,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Took the two Bears back upon the stage.
1659,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1660,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,As the curtain rolled up to the top
1661,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,A man at the back asked the Bears to stop:
1662,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"“Two clowns are on the stage,” said he,"
1663,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,“They have started their piece and I’ll let you see
1664,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,That you can’t interrupt or make a noise
1665,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Or you’ll spoil this show for these girls and boys.”
1666,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1667,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"“Your advice is right,” said TEDDY-B,"
1668,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And out they went the clowns to see.
1669,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The clowns were scared when they saw the Bears
1670,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Step up behind them unawares,"
1671,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And they ran for doors at left and right
1672,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And as quick as wink were out of sight.

1677,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1678,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"“As Dublin Mike and Pat from Cork,"
1679,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,They came on the stage to look for work.”
1680,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,]
1681,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1682,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1683,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1684,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But they were ordered back to earn their fee
1685,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And to take a turn with TEDDIES-B and G.
1686,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And from that hour the play went smart
1687,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,For the two bears helped in every part.
1688,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"They made those two clowns march and sing,"
1689,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Jump over chairs and through a ring,"
1690,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And climb up poles and ride a wheel
1691,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And do a clog-dance, toe and heel."
1692,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And when they finished amid loud applause
1693,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The Bears ran off on all four paws
1694,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,With the clowns on backs with jolly noise
1695,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Throwing kisses back to girls and boys.
1696,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The orchestra played “A Boy called Taps”
1697,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And then appeared a troupe of Japs:
1698,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"A dozen little men in tights,"
1699,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The heroes of a hundred fights.
1700,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1701,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,For a little while the Bears stood by
1702,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And watched the Japs their muscles try,"
1703,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And saw them balance balls and bricks
1704,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"On parasols and billiard sticks,"
1705,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And climb up ladders out of sight
1706,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And fall again and land all right.
1707,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1708,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Then TEDDY-B said he’d like to do
1709,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,A Western schoolboy trick he knew.
1710,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,He made the Japs stand in a row
1711,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And take hold of hands and not let go.
1712,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Then he caught one end and with whirling clip
1713,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,He showed them how to crack the whip.
1714,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1715,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The Japs went whizzing in the air
1716,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And whirled in circles everywhere;
1717,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But they did the trick so smart and neat
1718,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,That every Jap lit on his feet.
1719,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1720,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,A man with hoops was next to play
1721,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And he asked if TEDDY-G would stay
1722,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And help him show the boys and girls
1723,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,How wooden hoops were taught their twirls.
1724,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But this trick with hoops put TEDDY-G
1725,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,In so many circles he couldn’t see.
1726,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1727,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1728,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1729,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,They came flying at him through the air
1730,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And rolling in from everywhere;
1731,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And try his best he couldn’t throw
1732,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,A single hoop and make it go.
1733,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1734,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1735,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1736,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"He was hooped around from head to paw,"
1737,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The funniest sight you ever saw;
1738,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But he enjoyed the fun and said that he
1739,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Wore rings enough that day for three.
1740,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1741,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1742,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1743,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But the jolliest thing that day was when
1744,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The two Bears dressed as Irishmen:
1745,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,A Dublin Mike and a Pat from Cork
1746,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Came on the stage to look for work;
1747,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,TEDDY-G as Mike with workman’s hod
1748,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And TEDDY-B as Pat from Blarney sod;
1749,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1750,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"With blackthorn sticks their foes to hit,"
1751,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And filled to the brim with Irish wit.
1752,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Their Irish brogue in joke and song
1753,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Made the children laugh both loud and long.
1754,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1755,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1756,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1757,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The last part of the show that day
1758,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"Was sleight of hand, the programs say,"
1759,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But why it failed to work out well
1760,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The man who tried it couldn’t tell.
1761,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1762,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"A trunk was brought, a solid mass,"
1763,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,With iron locks and bound in brass.
1764,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The Bears were asked to get inside;
1765,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The trunk was locked and with rope was tied
1766,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the man announced that at his command
1767,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,He’d slide a curtain and there would stand
1768,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The Roosevelt Bears outside and free
1769,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,With the trunk unlocked by any key.
1770,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1771,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1772,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1773,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"But it didn’t work; the Bears weren’t there,"
1774,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And it gave the man a little scare
1775,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1776,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"To find he couldn’t do the trick,"
1777,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the trunk was unlocked pretty quick
1778,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1779,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"For fear they’d smother for want of air,"
1780,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But the Bears had gone no one knows where.
1781,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1782,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The trunk was empty; not as they feared;
1783,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The Roosevelt Bears had disappeared.
1784,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"The Bears had gone, but no one knew"
1785,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Just where to look or what to do.
1786,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1787,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Detectives hunted high and low
1788,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And questioned folks who ought to know,"
1789,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And listened for the slightest sound
1790,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And hunted rooms beneath the ground,"
1791,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"And through the halls walked round and round,"
1792,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,But not a trace of the Bears they found.
1793,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1794,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,[Illustration]
1795,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1796,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,At supper-time at home that night
1797,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,The boys and girls told of their flight;
1798,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the jokes they cracked and tricks they played
1799,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the jolliest kind of fun they made.
1800,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And how they saw them locked and tied
1801,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,So tight and fast that children cried.
1802,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1803,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Some little girls and wee boys too
1804,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Wouldn’t go to bed until they knew
1805,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,How TEDDY-B and TEDDY-G
1806,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Got out of the trunk without a key;
1807,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,
1808,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,"But their papas told them not to mind,"
1809,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,That some one the Bears that night would find
1810,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,And the papers sure the following day
1811,PHILADELPHIA CHILDREN,Would explain in full how they got away.

1826,ATLANTIC CITY,How the Bears got out of the box that day
1827,ATLANTIC CITY,"Was never known, the children say;"
1828,ATLANTIC CITY,"But that afternoon, about half-past four,"
1829,ATLANTIC CITY,"They engaged fine rooms on the seventh floor,"
1830,ATLANTIC CITY,
1831,ATLANTIC CITY,"About half-way up and half-way down,"
1832,ATLANTIC CITY,Of the best hotel there was in town;
1833,ATLANTIC CITY,"And there they stayed, enjoying a rest"
1834,ATLANTIC CITY,
1835,ATLANTIC CITY,"And eating things the very best,"
1836,ATLANTIC CITY,And seeing reporters and playing pool
1837,ATLANTIC CITY,And learning things not taught in school.

1843,ATLANTIC CITY,]
1844,ATLANTIC CITY,
1845,ATLANTIC CITY,"Said TEDDY-B one morning bright,"
1846,ATLANTIC CITY,After spending a hot and sleepless night:
1847,ATLANTIC CITY,“The weather’s warm and sticky too
1848,ATLANTIC CITY,For fellows dressed like me and you;
1849,ATLANTIC CITY,I move we take a little run
1850,ATLANTIC CITY,Down to the shore for some ocean fun.
1851,ATLANTIC CITY,
1852,ATLANTIC CITY,"I’ve heard it said that the bathing there,"
1853,ATLANTIC CITY,"With sandy bottoms everywhere,"
1854,ATLANTIC CITY,"Is quite a fad with men of wealth,"
1855,ATLANTIC CITY,Who go there simply for their health.”
1856,ATLANTIC CITY,
1857,ATLANTIC CITY,"“My health is good,” said TEDDY-G;"
1858,ATLANTIC CITY,“And I’ve wealth enough for you and me;
1859,ATLANTIC CITY,"But if bathing’s fun, that’s what I need;"
1860,ATLANTIC CITY,My health consists of fun and feed.”
1861,ATLANTIC CITY,
1862,ATLANTIC CITY,So off they went that very day
1863,ATLANTIC CITY,To try Atlantic City spray
1864,ATLANTIC CITY,
1865,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration:

1867,ATLANTIC CITY,"Copyright, 1907, by Edward Stern & Co., Inc."
1868,ATLANTIC CITY,
1869,ATLANTIC CITY,"“Across the sand in running dash,"
1870,ATLANTIC CITY,They struck the breakers with a splash.”
1871,ATLANTIC CITY,]
1872,ATLANTIC CITY,
1873,ATLANTIC CITY,They took a ferry to Camden town
1874,ATLANTIC CITY,And got a train which shot them down
1875,ATLANTIC CITY,Across New Jersey and to the sea
1876,ATLANTIC CITY,So quick they scarce had time to see
1877,ATLANTIC CITY,
1878,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1879,ATLANTIC CITY,
1880,ATLANTIC CITY,The porter boy who brushed their clothes
1881,ATLANTIC CITY,And told them that hotels in rows
1882,ATLANTIC CITY,Lined every street and the ocean front
1883,ATLANTIC CITY,So thick they wouldn’t have to hunt.
1884,ATLANTIC CITY,
1885,ATLANTIC CITY,"And bathing houses, a score or more,"
1886,ATLANTIC CITY,He said they’d find them near the shore.
1887,ATLANTIC CITY,They walked the boardwalk to and fro
1888,ATLANTIC CITY,And took a peep at every show;
1889,ATLANTIC CITY,
1890,ATLANTIC CITY,They heard bands play and auctioneers
1891,ATLANTIC CITY,Make speeches which reduced to tears
1892,ATLANTIC CITY,The crowds of buyers who bargains sought
1893,ATLANTIC CITY,But didn’t need the goods they bought.
1894,ATLANTIC CITY,
1895,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1896,ATLANTIC CITY,
1897,ATLANTIC CITY,They took a turn with a wheeling chair
1898,ATLANTIC CITY,"Of double size, to fit a bear,"
1899,ATLANTIC CITY,"With TEDDY-B, the lazy kind,"
1900,ATLANTIC CITY,"And TEDDY-G, the man behind."
1901,ATLANTIC CITY,
1902,ATLANTIC CITY,A palmist read their paws to see
1903,ATLANTIC CITY,How long they’d live and what would be
1904,ATLANTIC CITY,Their fortunes in the years to come
1905,ATLANTIC CITY,When as millionaires they’d be going some.
1906,ATLANTIC CITY,They saw the fish-haul on the pier
1907,ATLANTIC CITY,And the loaded net with fishes queer.
1908,ATLANTIC CITY,
1909,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1910,ATLANTIC CITY,
1911,ATLANTIC CITY,They rode the donkeys on the sand
1912,ATLANTIC CITY,And held some children by the hand
1913,ATLANTIC CITY,While rides they took on donkey back
1914,ATLANTIC CITY,And made the bathers clear the track.
1915,ATLANTIC CITY,
1916,ATLANTIC CITY,They went below with shivery feel
1917,ATLANTIC CITY,In a little boat where the water-wheel
1918,ATLANTIC CITY,Went splashing round with all its might
1919,ATLANTIC CITY,And pushed their boat into darkest night.
1920,ATLANTIC CITY,
1921,ATLANTIC CITY,And then to a boardwalk place they went
1922,ATLANTIC CITY,Two colored bathing suits to rent.
1923,ATLANTIC CITY,They dressed themselves like thousands more
1924,ATLANTIC CITY,Who were walking up and down the shore;
1925,ATLANTIC CITY,And across the sand in running dash
1926,ATLANTIC CITY,They struck the breakers with a splash.
1927,ATLANTIC CITY,
1928,ATLANTIC CITY,"Of all the fun of every sort,"
1929,ATLANTIC CITY,"Since Columbus sailed from Genoa’s port,"
1930,ATLANTIC CITY,That the old Atlantic ever had
1931,ATLANTIC CITY,"With ocean bathers, good or bad,"
1932,ATLANTIC CITY,
1933,ATLANTIC CITY,"With buccaneers or pirate crafts,"
1934,ATLANTIC CITY,"Or shipwrecked crews on lonesome rafts,"
1935,ATLANTIC CITY,"With fishermen in ocean wave,"
1936,ATLANTIC CITY,"Or boats sent out their lives to save,"
1937,ATLANTIC CITY,
1938,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1939,ATLANTIC CITY,
1940,ATLANTIC CITY,Or tourists bound for foreign clime
1941,ATLANTIC CITY,"With dinners upset all the time,"
1942,ATLANTIC CITY,With ocean fish of every form
1943,ATLANTIC CITY,"Which swim the same in calm or storm,"
1944,ATLANTIC CITY,
1945,ATLANTIC CITY,With Admiral Drake or Captain Kidd
1946,ATLANTIC CITY,"Who stole some gold and got it hid,"
1947,ATLANTIC CITY,Or with careless boys of whom you’ve read
1948,ATLANTIC CITY,"Who sometimes fall in over head,—"
1949,ATLANTIC CITY,
1950,ATLANTIC CITY,"This fun the Atlantic had that day,"
1951,ATLANTIC CITY,"Some fifty thousand bathers say,"
1952,ATLANTIC CITY,Beat every record for a thousand years
1953,ATLANTIC CITY,And made waves laugh themselves to tears.
1954,ATLANTIC CITY,
1955,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1956,ATLANTIC CITY,
1957,ATLANTIC CITY,For the Roosevelt Bears had nerve and pluck
1958,ATLANTIC CITY,And as they faced each wave to duck
1959,ATLANTIC CITY,They plunged right in and got upset
1960,ATLANTIC CITY,Head over paws and awful wet.
1961,ATLANTIC CITY,
1962,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration]
1963,ATLANTIC CITY,
1964,ATLANTIC CITY,They took boys out in water deep
1965,ATLANTIC CITY,And made them from their shoulders leap;
1966,ATLANTIC CITY,"And rescued swimmers, four or five,"
1967,ATLANTIC CITY,And brought them back to shore alive;
1968,ATLANTIC CITY,And when they tired of the ocean’s whirls
1969,ATLANTIC CITY,"They played on the sand with boys and girls,"
1970,ATLANTIC CITY,"And ran and danced and had lots of fun,"
1971,ATLANTIC CITY,And dried themselves in the mid-day sun.
1972,ATLANTIC CITY,
1973,ATLANTIC CITY,"When back they went to get their suits,"
1974,ATLANTIC CITY,"To put on trousers, coats and boots,"
1975,ATLANTIC CITY,"Said TEDDY-G from his little house,"
1976,ATLANTIC CITY,“This bathing suit wouldn’t fit a mouse;
1977,ATLANTIC CITY,It’s shrunk all up like a lady’s glove
1978,ATLANTIC CITY,And won’t come off by pull or shove.”
1979,ATLANTIC CITY,
1980,ATLANTIC CITY,"Said TEDDY-B from the box next door,"
1981,ATLANTIC CITY,“Why didn’t you put on three or four?”
1982,ATLANTIC CITY,But TEDDY-G didn’t see the joke
1983,ATLANTIC CITY,And said he’d rip the thing or choke.
1984,ATLANTIC CITY,
1985,ATLANTIC CITY,And rip he did from end to end
1986,ATLANTIC CITY,In a way no stitch would ever mend.
1987,ATLANTIC CITY,"“It came off that way both smooth and nice,”"
1988,ATLANTIC CITY,Said TEDDY-G when he asked the price.
1989,ATLANTIC CITY,
1990,ATLANTIC CITY,They went that night by lucky chance
1991,ATLANTIC CITY,To an ocean pier where a cake-walk dance
1992,ATLANTIC CITY,Was on in style with couples six
1993,ATLANTIC CITY,Who knew full well the cake-walk tricks.
1994,ATLANTIC CITY,
1995,ATLANTIC CITY,[Illustration:
1996,ATLANTIC CITY,
1997,ATLANTIC CITY,“_All four danced with toe and paw the smartest cake-walk you ever
1998,ATLANTIC CITY,saw._”
1999,ATLANTIC CITY,]
2000,ATLANTIC CITY,
2001,ATLANTIC CITY,Two pickaninnies won the prize;
2002,ATLANTIC CITY,They beat all records for their size;
2003,ATLANTIC CITY,And as they did their last encore
2004,ATLANTIC CITY,"The Roosevelt Bears went on the floor,"
2005,ATLANTIC CITY,And all four danced with toe and paw
2006,ATLANTIC CITY,The smartest cake-walk you ever saw.
2007,ATLANTIC CITY,
2008,ATLANTIC CITY,The dancing finished with laugh and cheer
2009,ATLANTIC CITY,Then all the children on the pier
2010,ATLANTIC CITY,Shook hands with TEDDIES-B and G
2011,ATLANTIC CITY,And asked them both to come to see
2012,ATLANTIC CITY,"A children’s dance, a pretty sight,"
2013,ATLANTIC CITY,Which they would give the following night.
2014,ATLANTIC CITY,
2015,ATLANTIC CITY,But the Bears replied with much regret
2016,ATLANTIC CITY,That Philadelphia they had not seen yet;
2017,ATLANTIC CITY,They must go back and crackers buy
2018,ATLANTIC CITY,"To celebrate Fourth of July,"
2019,ATLANTIC CITY,For they were bound to show the world
2020,ATLANTIC CITY,That when stars and stripes were first unfurled
2021,ATLANTIC CITY,
2022,ATLANTIC CITY,And liberty rang sweet and loud
2023,ATLANTIC CITY,"For warriors brave and patriots proud,"
2024,ATLANTIC CITY,"This flag and bell, right then and there,"
2025,ATLANTIC CITY,Meant freedom for both man and bear.

2043,FOURTH,"To Market Street, to a fireworks’ store,"
2044,FOURTH,"And bought a load of crackers red,"
2045,FOURTH,"And torpedoes round like balls of lead,"
2046,FOURTH,And great big whirlers which you light
2047,FOURTH,"And then run off with all your might,"
2048,FOURTH,And flags and kites and pistol toys:
2049,FOURTH,The kind to give to little boys;
2050,FOURTH,And rockets which go whizzing high
2051,FOURTH,To shoot bright stars around the sky;
2052,FOURTH,And sticks to hold and turn about
2053,FOURTH,While balls of fire come popping out;
2054,FOURTH,"And drums to beat and horns to blow,"
2055,FOURTH,And things to shoot and things to throw;
2056,FOURTH,And small balloons in colors gay
2057,FOURTH,And a hundred flags to give away;
2058,FOURTH,In all about twelve dollars’ worth
2059,FOURTH,To celebrate July the Fourth.

2065,FOURTH,
2066,FOURTH,They didn’t sleep a wink that night
2067,FOURTH,"But started out before ’twas light,"
2068,FOURTH,To historic Independence Square.
2069,FOURTH,"“For that,” said TEDDY-B, “is where"
2070,FOURTH,This western world beyond the sea
2071,FOURTH,Unfurled the flag of liberty;
2072,FOURTH,And that’s the place and this the date
2073,FOURTH,Where loyalty must celebrate.”
2074,FOURTH,"“Oh you come off,” said TEDDY-G,"
2075,FOURTH,“It’s fun that I am here to see;
2076,FOURTH,Who cares to-day who won the game?
2077,FOURTH,We’ll shoot off crackers just the same.”
2078,FOURTH,And this is how the two Bears talked
2079,FOURTH,As down the street to the Square they walked:
2080,FOURTH,
2081,FOURTH,[Illustration]
2082,FOURTH,
2083,FOURTH,TEDDY-B of heroes brave and bold
2084,FOURTH,And things they did in days of old;
2085,FOURTH,While TEDDY-G just had his say
2086,FOURTH,About things to do that very day.

2092,FOURTH,
2093,FOURTH,At the Liberty Bell they took a try
2094,FOURTH,And hoisted it up good and high
2095,FOURTH,"And rang it out both loud and clear,"
2096,FOURTH,And at every ring there went up a cheer;
2097,FOURTH,For the only day in all the year
2098,FOURTH,When the crack doesn’t spoil the tone sent forth
2099,FOURTH,"Is Independence Day, July the Fourth."
2100,FOURTH,"At least that’s what the children say,"
2101,FOURTH,And they know this bell from Z to A.
2102,FOURTH,
2103,FOURTH,[Illustration]
2104,FOURTH,
2105,FOURTH,But the fun began with the Roosevelt Bears
2106,FOURTH,When boys stole on them unawares
2107,FOURTH,And put a match to TEDDY-G
2108,FOURTH,"In his coat-tail pocket, where, you see,"
2109,FOURTH,"He had stored some crackers, a good-sized bunch,"
2110,FOURTH,Along with hard-boiled eggs for lunch.

2119,FOURTH,
2120,FOURTH,Lickety-split-pat-pit-bang-boo!
2121,FOURTH,"And the coat tail smoked and split in two,"
2122,FOURTH,And hard-boiled eggs shot here and there
2123,FOURTH,And the Bear went up and down in air.
2124,FOURTH,"But he told the lads he didn’t care,"
2125,FOURTH,That fun might start in anywhere;
2126,FOURTH,
2127,FOURTH,"At front or back, in hat or boot,"
2128,FOURTH,Put punk to powder and let it shoot.
2129,FOURTH,"“We are out,” he said, “for fun and noise"
2130,FOURTH,"And when fun is trump, boys will be boys.”"
2131,FOURTH,And from that hour the lads and he
2132,FOURTH,Shared all there was to do or see.
2133,FOURTH,
2134,FOURTH,[Illustration]
2135,FOURTH,
2136,FOURTH,"They strung a wire from tree to tree,"
2137,FOURTH,And then the fellows with TEDDY-B
2138,FOURTH,"Put crackers all along the wire,"
2139,FOURTH,To prepare the field for an army fire.
2140,FOURTH,
2141,FOURTH,"Said TEDDY-G, as he explained the play,"
2142,FOURTH,"“We’ll fasten a flag on the wire half-way,"
2143,FOURTH,And you boys under yonder tree
2144,FOURTH,"Who have taken sides with TEDDY-B,"
2145,FOURTH,
2146,FOURTH,"When I say the word, you put your fire"

2156,TEDDY-B,
2157,TEDDY-B,"While I, if my boys a hand will lend,"
2158,TEDDY-B,Will put a match to the other end.
2159,TEDDY-B,"To reach the flag first, that’s the game,"
2160,TEDDY-B,And the side which wins this piece of fame
2161,TEDDY-B,Wins all the crackers big or small
2162,TEDDY-B,Which haven’t gone off when time I call.
2163,TEDDY-B,
2164,TEDDY-B,If on both sides the armies flunk
2165,TEDDY-B,Both captains use again their punk.”
2166,TEDDY-B,When both the sides the rules did know
2167,TEDDY-B,"TEDDY-G called out, “One! two! three! Go!”"
2168,TEDDY-B,
2169,TEDDY-B,[Illustration]
2170,TEDDY-B,
2171,TEDDY-B,And at the words two armies shot
2172,TEDDY-B,Their cracker guns both quick and hot
2173,TEDDY-B,As on they marched along the wire
2174,TEDDY-B,In powder smoke and blazing fire.
2175,TEDDY-B,
2176,TEDDY-B,The flag was won by TEDDY-G
2177,TEDDY-B,"And prisoners taken, ninety-three"
2178,TEDDY-B,"Of the finest crackers the others had,"
2179,TEDDY-B,"All not shot off, both good and bad."
2180,TEDDY-B,
2181,TEDDY-B,[Illustration]
2182,TEDDY-B,
2183,TEDDY-B,But this army game was children’s play
2184,TEDDY-B,Compared with things they did that day:
2185,TEDDY-B,"From noon till night they let things go,"
2186,TEDDY-B,"In sky above and on earth below,"
2187,TEDDY-B,
2188,TEDDY-B,[Illustration]
2189,TEDDY-B,
2190,TEDDY-B,"With slap and bang, in smoke and noise,"
2191,TEDDY-B,Like any two July Fourth boys.
2192,TEDDY-B,
2193,TEDDY-B,[Illustration]
2194,TEDDY-B,
2195,TEDDY-B,They sent balloons up to the clouds
2196,TEDDY-B,"And a dozen kites to please the crowds,"
2197,TEDDY-B,And then shot rockets just to try
2198,TEDDY-B,To hit the things up in the sky;
2199,TEDDY-B,They dug a hole down in the ground
2200,TEDDY-B,And filled it full of crackers round
2201,TEDDY-B,And shot them off to hear the sound.
2202,TEDDY-B,
2203,TEDDY-B,"They burned their paws and scorched their hair,"
2204,TEDDY-B,And when darkness came they did their share
2205,TEDDY-B,"Of firing rockets everywhere,"
2206,TEDDY-B,"And in burning lights, a fiery red,"
2207,TEDDY-B,Till long past time for going to bed.
2208,TEDDY-B,
2209,TEDDY-B,[Illustration]
2210,TEDDY-B,
2211,TEDDY-B,"When the day was o’er said TEDDY-B,"

2214,TEDDY-B,"The elephant and polar bear,"
2215,TEDDY-B,"The lions, tigers, and kangaroos,"
2216,TEDDY-B,And tell them one and all the news:
2217,TEDDY-B,
2218,TEDDY-B,That July the Fourth is the day that we
2219,TEDDY-B,Who own and love this country
2220,TEDDY-B,"Do celebrate in smoke and noise,"
2221,TEDDY-B,That we may teach our girls and boys

2255,ZOO,"As they reached the high fence round the Zoo,"
2256,ZOO,"In the early morning, about half-past two,"
2257,ZOO,“Is to get in there with this load of cake

2260,ZOO,"“And throw this rope back here to me,"
2261,ZOO,And pull up the baskets one by one
2262,ZOO,And we’ll land in there a good-sized ton
2263,ZOO,"Of the finest cake that was ever made,"
2264,ZOO,And strawberry tarts and lemonade
2265,ZOO,And cherry pie and sugar sticks
2266,ZOO,And red ice cream in good-sized bricks
2267,ZOO,And peanut candy and chocolate eclairs
2268,ZOO,And other things quite new to bears.”
2269,ZOO,
2270,ZOO,“Don’t waste your time in telling me;
2271,ZOO,"I bought these things,” said TEDDY-G;"

2274,ZOO,
2275,ZOO,[Illustration]
2276,ZOO,
2277,ZOO,And out a limb and dropped below
2278,ZOO,"And called out, “All right; I’m in; let go.”"
2279,ZOO,And up went baskets two by two
2280,ZOO,Over the fence into the Zoo;
2281,ZOO,
2282,ZOO,[Illustration]
2283,ZOO,
2284,ZOO,And before the day began to break
2285,ZOO,The Bears had camped with their load of cake
2286,ZOO,On a grassy knoll where they couldn’t hide
2287,ZOO,And with dens and pens on every side.
2288,ZOO,"“We’re in here now,” said TEDDY-B;"
2289,ZOO,“What do you say we do?” said he.
2290,ZOO,
2291,ZOO,"“Let’s feed the animals,” said TEDDY-G;"
2292,ZOO,“I move we let out two or three
2293,ZOO,And bring them here and feed them cake
2294,ZOO,And see just how our show will take;
2295,ZOO,"And if they are pleased, why we’ll go round"
2296,ZOO,And let loose everything on the ground.”
2297,ZOO,
2298,ZOO,To the elephant house the two Bears went
2299,ZOO,"And stirred up the biggest elephant,"
2300,ZOO,And marched him over to their cake
2301,ZOO,Before he had time to get half awake.
2302,ZOO,
2303,ZOO,"“You mind these things,” said TEDDY-G,"
2304,ZOO,“Our breakfast hour is half-past three.
2305,ZOO,If you are good you can have a snack
2306,ZOO,To keep you chewing till we come back.”
2307,ZOO,And they gave old Bolivar (that was his name)
2308,ZOO,Some things to eat till back they came.

2317,ZOO,

2319,ZOO,Where monkeys of every size and age
2320,ZOO,Were using hands and feet and lungs
2321,ZOO,And saying good-morning in a thousand tongues.
2322,ZOO,
2323,ZOO,TEDDY-B made them promise they’d be good
2324,ZOO,(At least that’s what he understood)
2325,ZOO,If he’d open the cage and let them out

2338,ZOO,"And winked at each other a little queer,"
2339,ZOO,And nodded their heads and seemed to say
2340,ZOO,That the two Bears’ orders they’d obey.
2341,ZOO,
2342,ZOO,"The cage was opened and the crowd went out,"
2343,ZOO,"Little and big, with laugh and shout,"
2344,ZOO,"Upsetting each other across the green,"
2345,ZOO,The funniest bunch that was ever seen.
2346,ZOO,
2347,ZOO,[Illustration]
2348,ZOO,
2349,ZOO,The Bears went then to the beaver pond
2350,ZOO,
2351,ZOO,And told the beavers if they were fond
2352,ZOO,
2353,ZOO,Of good ice cream served by baboons
2354,ZOO,
2355,ZOO,To bring on their tails to use for spoons.
2356,ZOO,
2357,ZOO,They saw some foxes red and gray
2358,ZOO,And asked them to dine with them that day.
2359,ZOO,The wolves looked hungry and said they’d see
2360,ZOO,That all left over was given them free.
2361,ZOO,
2362,ZOO,The rhinoceros couldn’t accept their treat;
2363,ZOO,He had some rheumatics in his feet.
2364,ZOO,But in a cage near-by a kangaroo
2365,ZOO,Jumped twenty feet when they let him through.
2366,ZOO,
2367,ZOO,[Illustration]
2368,ZOO,
2369,ZOO,An ostrich standing six feet high
2370,ZOO,Called out to the Bears as they went by
2371,ZOO,To hurry around with a piece of pie.
2372,ZOO,
2373,ZOO,[Illustration]
2374,ZOO,
2375,ZOO,Two mountain goats with curling horn
2376,ZOO,"Said the mountain crest where they were born,"
2377,ZOO,
2378,ZOO,Their father rented just for thanks
2379,ZOO,"To the Roosevelt Bears to play their pranks,"
2380,ZOO,
2381,ZOO,And this they thought was cause indeed
2382,ZOO,Why they should be asked to the morning feed.
2383,ZOO,
2384,ZOO,A hedgehog and a porcupine
2385,ZOO,"Were the next pair asked by the Bears to dine,"
2386,ZOO,Then a dromedary chewing his cud
2387,ZOO,"Said he wouldn’t budge from where he stood,"
2388,ZOO,
2389,ZOO,But if they’d bring him a piece of cake
2390,ZOO,He’d see if he liked their kind of bake.
2391,ZOO,
2392,ZOO,From there they went to the animals’ cage
2393,ZOO,Where they found the tigers in a rage
2394,ZOO,And the lions roaring to beat the band
2395,ZOO,In language the Bears didn’t understand.
2396,ZOO,
2397,ZOO,[Illustration]
2398,ZOO,
2399,ZOO,A chimpanzee came near to see
2400,ZOO,And he made a face at TEDDY-G.
2401,ZOO,He was eating pie and said he feared
2402,ZOO,That their basket lunch had disappeared.
2403,ZOO,
2404,ZOO,The Bears took warning and started back
2405,ZOO,"To find ten keepers on their track,"
2406,ZOO,And animals both big and small
2407,ZOO,"Running wild on every mall,"
2408,ZOO,And Bolivar with his trumpet loud
2409,ZOO,Calling for help to stop the crowd.
2410,ZOO,
2411,ZOO,The monkeys had gone in a solid bunch
2412,ZOO,"And captured the whole of the picnic lunch,"
2413,ZOO,"And out on limbs and high up on poles,"
2414,ZOO,"And on top of roofs and into holes,"
2415,ZOO,"And every monkey with cake or jam,"
2416,ZOO,"Or pie or tart or sandwich ham,"
2417,ZOO,
2418,ZOO,Or nuts or lemonade or cheese;
2419,ZOO,"And Bolivar shaking poles and trees,"
2420,ZOO,"And hungry wolves and the kangaroo,"
2421,ZOO,And mountain goats and a deer or two
2422,ZOO,"Running wild from place to place,"
2423,ZOO,Helping on the monkey chase.

2429,ZOO,]
2430,ZOO,
2431,ZOO,
2432,ZOO,’Twas noon that day when keepers ten
2433,ZOO,"And a police brigade of fifty men,"
2434,ZOO,And a hundred boys and firemen six
2435,ZOO,Got the monkey troupe to stop their tricks.
2436,ZOO,
2437,ZOO,The Bears looked on throughout the show
2438,ZOO,And helped on the fun by laughing so
2439,ZOO,"For TEDDY-G, since he was a cub,"
2440,ZOO,"Or at Bunker Hill down in the Hub,"
2441,ZOO,Said that making fun seemed to be his forte
2442,ZOO,And that he never had such lively sport.
2443,ZOO,
2444,ZOO,But the keeper made him change his laugh
2445,ZOO,When he locked them up with a big giraffe
2446,ZOO,And told them to stay and pay a fine
2447,ZOO,When the police court met next day at nine.

2461,FISHING,
2462,FISHING,[Illustration]
2463,FISHING,
2464,FISHING,When the Roosevelt Bears had paid their fine
2465,FISHING,"For the mischief done and the monkey shine,"
2466,FISHING,They said good-bye to the big giraffe
2467,FISHING,And told him his neck was too long by half;
2468,FISHING,
2469,FISHING,And asked the time it took his food
2470,FISHING,To reach his body from where he chewed;
2471,FISHING,"And why he held his head so high,"
2472,FISHING,And the size of collars he had to buy;
2473,FISHING,
2474,FISHING,[Illustration]
2475,FISHING,
2476,FISHING,And why he was neither round nor square;
2477,FISHING,But the old giraffe didn’t seem to care;
2478,FISHING,He wagged his tail and winked his eye
2479,FISHING,And nodded his head to say good-bye.
2480,FISHING,
2481,FISHING,"When they quit the Zoo and got outside,"
2482,FISHING,“Let us take a train for a little ride;
2483,FISHING,I’m tired of town and want to see
2484,FISHING,"A farm or stream,” said TEDDY-B."
2485,FISHING,
2486,FISHING,"So a train they took without the fare,"
2487,FISHING,For where it went they didn’t care.
2488,FISHING,"When “Tickets, please,” the conductor said,"
2489,FISHING,TEDDY-G began to scratch his head
2490,FISHING,"And to think up names of towns he knew,"
2491,FISHING,Like Hoboken and Kalamazoo;
2492,FISHING,
2493,FISHING,"But when “Tickets, please,” he said again,"
2494,FISHING,TEDDY-G got busy with a ten
2495,FISHING,"And said, “Take this for your railway pay"
2496,FISHING,And stop the train some time to-day
2497,FISHING,Where fishing’s good if you go that way.”
2498,FISHING,The conductor asked them questions strange
2499,FISHING,About their plans as he gave them change
2500,FISHING,
2501,FISHING,[Illustration]
2502,FISHING,
2503,FISHING,And slips of paper with holes punched through;
2504,FISHING,He said a fishing stream he knew;
2505,FISHING,
2506,FISHING,He’d stop the train at any rate
2507,FISHING,And show them where to buy some bait
2508,FISHING,And fishing poles and hook and line
2509,FISHING,And a jolly inn to sleep and dine.
2510,FISHING,
2511,FISHING,"They reached the place that day at two,"
2512,FISHING,"And said good-bye to the railroad crew,"
2513,FISHING,

2517,FISHING,
2518,FISHING,"“They met a lad on his way from school,"
2519,FISHING,Whom they stopped to question about a rule.”
2520,FISHING,]
2521,FISHING,
2522,FISHING,And went by a path up a mountain ridge
2523,FISHING,As the train went on across a bridge.
2524,FISHING,They found the place and got fitted out
2525,FISHING,"With six poles apiece both long and stout,"
2526,FISHING,And bait enough and lines and hooks
2527,FISHING,To fish a year in a dozen brooks.
2528,FISHING,
2529,FISHING,"For said TEDDY-G, “If fishing’s play"
2530,FISHING,"Then I want enough, for I mean to stay"
2531,FISHING,Right by the game for at least a week
2532,FISHING,Until every fish that’s in the creek
2533,FISHING,Is caught and deemed and cooked and ate
2534,FISHING,Or cut up in pieces to use for bait.”
2535,FISHING,So down their rods and lines they took
2536,FISHING,To the stream below to try their luck.
2537,FISHING,
2538,FISHING,[Illustration]
2539,FISHING,
2540,FISHING,Of all the fishing that was ever done
2541,FISHING,"By Izaak Walton or his eldest son,"
2542,FISHING,"Or by boys who fish with pins for hooks,"
2543,FISHING,"That we read about in the picture books,"
2544,FISHING,Or for salmon trout which weigh a ton
2545,FISHING,"That they say are caught in Oregon,"
2546,FISHING,
2547,FISHING,[Illustration]
2548,FISHING,
2549,FISHING,"Or for shad in the River Delaware,"
2550,FISHING,"Or for pike or black bass anywhere,"
2551,FISHING,The fish that day caught by the Bears
2552,FISHING,Would take first prizes at all the fairs;
2553,FISHING,
2554,FISHING,"And the way they caught them left and right,"
2555,FISHING,"And the way they coaxed the fish to bite,"
2556,FISHING,"And the way they tossed the fish in air,"
2557,FISHING,"Landing in trees and everywhere,"
2558,FISHING,"And the way they made the chipmunks run,"
2559,FISHING,"The fish, themselves, enjoyed the fun."
2560,FISHING,
2561,FISHING,"For one fish spoke, vows TEDDY-G,"
2562,FISHING,"A great big pounder, two or three,"
2563,FISHING,And said he wouldn’t miss the game
2564,FISHING,Even if he never lived again.
2565,FISHING,"“A sport,” he said, “like TEDDY-G,"
2566,FISHING,Is the kind that fishes love to see.”
2567,FISHING,
2568,FISHING,[Illustration]
2569,FISHING,
2570,FISHING,TEDDY-G got his line caught in a tree
2571,FISHING,And climbed up on high to get it free
2572,FISHING,"When a ’possum called down from above,"
2573,FISHING,“If you come up here you’ll get a shove
2574,FISHING,
2575,FISHING,Which will toss you off and break your head
2576,FISHING,And put you fifteen weeks in bed.”
2577,FISHING,But TEDDY-G just shook with glee
2578,FISHING,"And said, “I’ll come right up to see.”"
2579,FISHING,The ’possum scared and trembled so
2580,FISHING,He fell off the limb and down below
2581,FISHING,Where TEDDY-B broke an ugly fall
2582,FISHING,By catching him like a rubber ball.
2583,FISHING,
2584,FISHING,They fed that ’possum fishes eight
2585,FISHING,And gave him hook and line and bait
2586,FISHING,And told him stories about the Zoo
2587,FISHING,And the things they let the monkeys do.
2588,FISHING,
2589,FISHING,[Illustration]
2590,FISHING,
2591,FISHING,They met a man by the stream that day
2592,FISHING,"Who has fished for a hundred years they say,"
2593,FISHING,"In ocean, river, creek and pond,"
2594,FISHING,"And mountain brook and lake beyond,"
2595,FISHING,"With statesmen bold and actors gay,"
2596,FISHING,And farmer lads found by the way.
2597,FISHING,
2598,FISHING,"He told them stories of fish he’d caught,"
2599,FISHING,"And when fish were few, of fish he’d bought."
2600,FISHING,And then had talked of this big land
2601,FISHING,And of men he knew on every hand:
2602,FISHING,The true to love and those to hate
2603,FISHING,Who fish for gain with stolen bait.
2604,FISHING,
2605,FISHING,He told them how to have most fun
2606,FISHING,When they struck the town of Washington;
2607,FISHING,"“Because,” he said, “though I’m on the shelf,"
2608,FISHING,I had some fun there once myself.”
2609,FISHING,
2610,FISHING,TEDDY-B said he would like to know
2611,FISHING,How near a Roosevelt Bear could go
2612,FISHING,To the Capitol or Monument
2613,FISHING,Without being shot by the President.
2614,FISHING,
2615,FISHING,[Illustration]
2616,FISHING,
2617,FISHING,"But the man replied, “Trout-fishing’s fine,"
2618,FISHING,But shooting bears isn’t in my line.
2619,FISHING,
2620,FISHING,Take my advice and take your gun
2621,FISHING,When you turn your steps towards Washington.”
2622,FISHING,
2623,FISHING,They shook his hand both long and tight
2624,FISHING,And said they’d leave that very night.
2625,FISHING,
2626,FISHING,"They could get a train, they said, at four"
2627,FISHING,For Washington and Baltimore.
2628,FISHING,
2629,FISHING,[Illustration]
2630,FISHING,
2631,FISHING,They tramped along a country pike
2632,FISHING,"And wished for horses, train or bike,"
2633,FISHING,"Till they met a lad on his way from school,"
2634,FISHING,Whom they stopped to question about a rule
2635,FISHING,"To multiply and square and add,"
2636,FISHING,"And what teachers did with lessons bad,"
2637,FISHING,"And who made spelling and what ’twas for,"
2638,FISHING,"And the day and hour of the next big war,"
2639,FISHING,"And what athletics were all about,"
2640,FISHING,"And where figures go when you rub them out,"
2641,FISHING,"And why the moon isn’t always round,"
2642,FISHING,"And the difference between a noise and sound,"
2643,FISHING,"And on a fence, how long ’twould take"
2644,FISHING,"To rest an hour or a dinner bake,"
2645,FISHING,"And how things inside the earth were done,"
2646,FISHING,But the lad couldn’t answer a single one.
2647,FISHING,
2648,FISHING,"Said TEDDY-G: “If it doesn’t rain,"
2649,FISHING,And you’ll tell us where to get a train
2650,FISHING,And the fare to pay and how long the run
2651,FISHING,"From the place you name to Washington,"
2652,FISHING,"And your age and weight and greatest height,"
2653,FISHING,"And two bears you know that never bite,"
2654,FISHING,"I’ll give you a dollar, quick as wink,"
2655,FISHING,And let you have it before you think.”
2656,FISHING,
2657,FISHING,[Illustration]
2658,FISHING,
2659,FISHING,Though he never learned this dollar trick
2660,FISHING,"The lad was bright and he answered quick,"
2661,FISHING,And they said good-bye and it didn’t rain
2662,FISHING,Till they stepped on board their Pullman train.
2663,FISHING,
2664,FISHING,"Said TEDDY-G, as he lit his pipe,"
2665,FISHING,"And bought some apples red and ripe,"
2666,FISHING,And settled down in an easy seat
2667,FISHING,"With a resting-place for both his feet,"
2668,FISHING,“I’m tired of clothes; I’m tired of fun;
2669,FISHING,When I see the town of Washington
2670,FISHING,I’m off again for the woolly West;
2671,FISHING,I like the mountains much the best;
2672,FISHING,I want to live as free as air;
2673,FISHING,I’m satisfied to be a bear.”
2674,FISHING,
2675,FISHING,"“But you forget,” said TEDDY-B,"
2676,FISHING,“That all these things we came East to see
2677,FISHING,Were made by the brains of every clime
2678,FISHING,To keep folks working all the time.”
2679,FISHING,
2680,FISHING,"“That’s all right,” said TEDDY-G,"
2681,FISHING,"“They can work ahead, but as for me"
2682,FISHING,I don’t believe that bears were made
2683,FISHING,To be busy always at a trade.”

2698,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2699,PITTSBURG,
2700,PITTSBURG,They were on the train and at their ease
2701,PITTSBURG,"When the conductor called out “Tickets, please.”"
2702,PITTSBURG,"“We have no tickets,” said TEDDY-G,"
2703,PITTSBURG,"“But cash we have, as you will see,"
2704,PITTSBURG,And to Washington we want to go
2705,PITTSBURG,To see the President and to let him know
2706,PITTSBURG,That we are fully satisfied
2707,PITTSBURG,That Uncle Sam is tall and wide
2708,PITTSBURG,"And big around, of mighty girth,"
2709,PITTSBURG,The greatest show on all the earth;
2710,PITTSBURG,His boys and girls are full of fun
2711,PITTSBURG,From Omaha to Washington.”
2712,PITTSBURG,
2713,PITTSBURG,"But the conductor said, “You ought to know"
2714,PITTSBURG,If to Washington you want to go
2715,PITTSBURG,You’ve started wrong; this train you’re on
2716,PITTSBURG,Is a Pittsburg special from Washington;
2717,PITTSBURG,"And to-morrow morning, if we’re not late,"
2718,PITTSBURG,You’ll be in Pittsburg at half-past eight.”
2719,PITTSBURG,
2720,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2721,PITTSBURG,
2722,PITTSBURG,"The Bears looked dazed and then looked mad,"
2723,PITTSBURG,And then they laughed and both looked glad.
2724,PITTSBURG,
2725,PITTSBURG,"Said TEDDY-B, “Pay up the fares;"
2726,PITTSBURG,We’ll pass to-morrow as millionaires
2727,PITTSBURG,And found a library and put through a deal
2728,PITTSBURG,Of high finance in oil or steel.”
2729,PITTSBURG,
2730,PITTSBURG,But TEDDY-G didn’t think so far;
2731,PITTSBURG,He thought of night and the sleeping car;
2732,PITTSBURG,
2733,PITTSBURG,He recalled some cranky things he said
2734,PITTSBURG,When they made him sleep in an upper bed
2735,PITTSBURG,"On a train out West, and the banjo song,"
2736,PITTSBURG,And the things they did a little wrong
2737,PITTSBURG,Till both were put right off the train
2738,PITTSBURG,On a Kansas farm in a shower of rain.
2739,PITTSBURG,
2740,PITTSBURG,The conductor heard this wise remark:
2741,PITTSBURG,"“If on this train, when the night is dark,"
2742,PITTSBURG,"You want this Bear to behave himself,"
2743,PITTSBURG,Don’t make him sleep on a Pullman shelf.”
2744,PITTSBURG,
2745,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2746,PITTSBURG,
2747,PITTSBURG,But the trip was made without mishap
2748,PITTSBURG,And both the Bears enjoyed a nap
2749,PITTSBURG,"In lower berths till eight o’clock,"
2750,PITTSBURG,When the porter gave their berths a knock
2751,PITTSBURG,"And said, “Get up; it’s broad day light;"
2752,PITTSBURG,The Iron City is now in sight.”
2753,PITTSBURG,
2754,PITTSBURG,But things outside looked black as night
2755,PITTSBURG,"And said TEDDY-B, “Do you mean to say"
2756,PITTSBURG,That this is Pittsburg and this is day?”
2757,PITTSBURG,
2758,PITTSBURG,"The man replied, “Get up; that’s smoke;"
2759,PITTSBURG,Take my advice and when you joke
2760,PITTSBURG,"About this town, don’t do it loud,"
2761,PITTSBURG,"For Pittsburg people live in a cloud,"
2762,PITTSBURG,And their ideas about a bear
2763,PITTSBURG,May be colored some by Pittsburg air.”
2764,PITTSBURG,"“What’s that you say?” called TEDDY-G,"
2765,PITTSBURG,"“You seem to know your geography,"
2766,PITTSBURG,"But let me say right here and now,"
2767,PITTSBURG,I’ll teach your Pittsburg people how
2768,PITTSBURG,"To dance and sing, to laugh and joke,"
2769,PITTSBURG,"In mountain air or city smoke,"
2770,PITTSBURG,For they must know this very day
2771,PITTSBURG,That Pittsburg too was made for play.”

2778,PITTSBURG,We’ll pass to-morrow as millionaires.’”
2779,PITTSBURG,]
2780,PITTSBURG,
2781,PITTSBURG,They took a cab to a big hotel
2782,PITTSBURG,Where things are done both smart and swell;
2783,PITTSBURG,"And breakfast over, TEDDY-B"
2784,PITTSBURG,
2785,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2786,PITTSBURG,
2787,PITTSBURG,"On mischief bent, went out to see"
2788,PITTSBURG,What the telegraph and phone could do
2789,PITTSBURG,To get a crowd their tricks to view.
2790,PITTSBURG,
2791,PITTSBURG,"He called up schools, every one in town,"
2792,PITTSBURG,And ordered all the children down
2793,PITTSBURG,To the Old Block House at noon to see
2794,PITTSBURG,The Teddy Bears teach history.
2795,PITTSBURG,
2796,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2797,PITTSBURG,
2798,PITTSBURG,Then on the Mayor he played a lark
2799,PITTSBURG,"By ordering the police to Schenley Park,"
2800,PITTSBURG,To be locked up there till after dark;
2801,PITTSBURG,"“For,” said TEDDY-B, “the police you know"
2802,PITTSBURG,Might spoil our little Block House show.”
2803,PITTSBURG,
2804,PITTSBURG,At costume shops each Teddy Bear
2805,PITTSBURG,Bought a lot of Indian things to wear.
2806,PITTSBURG,They planned at the Old Block House to meet
2807,PITTSBURG,"At the corner of a near-by street,"
2808,PITTSBURG,And from that spot like Indians race
2809,PITTSBURG,And take possession of the place.
2810,PITTSBURG,They did the trick in Wild West style;
2811,PITTSBURG,Their whoops and yells were heard a mile;
2812,PITTSBURG,
2813,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2814,PITTSBURG,
2815,PITTSBURG,But the fight was short; no one to scare;
2816,PITTSBURG,There wasn’t a soul there anywhere.
2817,PITTSBURG,They made the place from roof to floor
2818,PITTSBURG,Like seventeen hundred and sixty-four
2819,PITTSBURG,And put things into shape to fool
2820,PITTSBURG,The boys and girls from every school.
2821,PITTSBURG,
2822,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2823,PITTSBURG,
2824,PITTSBURG,"The children came, five thousand strong,"
2825,PITTSBURG,"A happy, merry, lively throng;"
2826,PITTSBURG,
2827,PITTSBURG,The little ones by teachers led
2828,PITTSBURG,"To study history, they said,"
2829,PITTSBURG,
2830,PITTSBURG,But the history lesson learned that day
2831,PITTSBURG,"Was livelier stuff, the fellows say,"
2832,PITTSBURG,
2833,PITTSBURG,Than most boys learn at public school;
2834,PITTSBURG,"For it didn’t follow any rule,"
2835,PITTSBURG,But just shot off with laughter loud
2836,PITTSBURG,In every corner of the crowd.
2837,PITTSBURG,
2838,PITTSBURG,"The Teddy Bears, as Indians brave,"
2839,PITTSBURG,Did everything but behave:
2840,PITTSBURG,They chased each other round the Block
2841,PITTSBURG,With bow and arrow and tomahawk;
2842,PITTSBURG,
2843,PITTSBURG,[Illustration:
2844,PITTSBURG,
2845,PITTSBURG,“_They chased each other round the Block with bow and arrow and
2846,PITTSBURG,tomahawk._”
2847,PITTSBURG,]
2848,PITTSBURG,
2849,PITTSBURG,They climbed to the roof and danced a jig
2850,PITTSBURG,And called to children small and big
2851,PITTSBURG,To catch the arrows every time
2852,PITTSBURG,And bring them back and get a dime;
2853,PITTSBURG,And then to finish up the sport
2854,PITTSBURG,They asked the boys to take the fort:
2855,PITTSBURG,The boys to be the soldiers bold
2856,PITTSBURG,And they as Indians the place to hold.
2857,PITTSBURG,
2858,PITTSBURG,In this the boys came out ahead;
2859,PITTSBURG,"The Bears pretended they were dead,"
2860,PITTSBURG,While the boys to do the thing up well
2861,PITTSBURG,Sent two dead Bears to the hotel.
2862,PITTSBURG,In half an hour they lived again
2863,PITTSBURG,And were out on bicycles for a spin;
2864,PITTSBURG,
2865,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2866,PITTSBURG,
2867,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2868,PITTSBURG,
2869,PITTSBURG,"This time to see men making steel,"
2870,PITTSBURG,"And in Highland Park to have a wheel,"
2871,PITTSBURG,"And to see the Zoo and the Bridge of Sighs,"
2872,PITTSBURG,"And Luna Park, where they won the prize."
2873,PITTSBURG,
2874,PITTSBURG,In the afternoon they put up a lark
2875,PITTSBURG,At the entrance gate of Highland Park.
2876,PITTSBURG,A little lad who flew a kite
2877,PITTSBURG,Had got the string caught good and tight
2878,PITTSBURG,On the entrance post when TEDDY-G
2879,PITTSBURG,Climbed up the post and said that he
2880,PITTSBURG,Would untie the knot and start the kite
2881,PITTSBURG,Up to the sky and out of sight.
2882,PITTSBURG,
2883,PITTSBURG,A rope was lying twirled around
2884,PITTSBURG,"Where workmen left it on the ground,"
2885,PITTSBURG,And TEDDY-G as quick as wink
2886,PITTSBURG,And before the men had time to think
2887,PITTSBURG,Caught up the rope and made it tight
2888,PITTSBURG,"From post to post, from left to right,"
2889,PITTSBURG,And out he went like a circus clown
2890,PITTSBURG,"And whirled around, head up and down,"
2891,PITTSBURG,And walked the rope and made more play
2892,PITTSBURG,Than folks had seen for many a day.
2893,PITTSBURG,
2894,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2895,PITTSBURG,
2896,PITTSBURG,[Illustration]
2897,PITTSBURG,
2898,PITTSBURG,At six o’clock they said good-bye
2899,PITTSBURG,To busy streets and smoky sky
2900,PITTSBURG,And to boys and girls for the day of fun
2901,PITTSBURG,And started back towards Washington.
2902,PITTSBURG,
2903,PITTSBURG,"Said TEDDY-B, as a town they passed"
2904,PITTSBURG,"Where furnaces made fiery blast,"
2905,PITTSBURG,“I’d rather be a Teddy Bear
2906,PITTSBURG,Than stand that heat and work in there;
2907,PITTSBURG,"But this old world was made, they say,"
2908,PITTSBURG,So that men would work and bears could play.”

2920,NEWSPAPER,
2921,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
2922,NEWSPAPER,
2923,NEWSPAPER,When the station clock was striking four
2924,NEWSPAPER,The Bears got off at Baltimore.
2925,NEWSPAPER,They met a newsboy on the street
2926,NEWSPAPER,Who said the newsboys were to meet
2927,NEWSPAPER,That night at six in a nook of theirs
2928,NEWSPAPER,And they’d like to have the Teddy Bears
2929,NEWSPAPER,Drop in and help them plan and think
2930,NEWSPAPER,How best to earn some extra chink.
2931,NEWSPAPER,"Said TEDDY-B, “I’d like to walk"
2932,NEWSPAPER,Around to your club and hear you talk
2933,NEWSPAPER,And make a speech and help along
2934,NEWSPAPER,"With dance or story, trick or song.”"
2935,NEWSPAPER,"“You ought to know,” the lad replied,"
2936,NEWSPAPER,“That some months ago a newsboy died.
2937,NEWSPAPER,That night his papers didn’t sell
2938,NEWSPAPER,And he had no home; no one to tell
2939,NEWSPAPER,"How cold he was and hungry too,"
2940,NEWSPAPER,And he just died; was frozen through.
2941,NEWSPAPER,We mean to give a newsboys’ show
2942,NEWSPAPER,To buy a home where the boys can go.”
2943,NEWSPAPER,
2944,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration:
2945,NEWSPAPER,
2946,NEWSPAPER,“_They met a newsboy on the street who said the newsboys were to meet
2947,NEWSPAPER,that night at six in a nook of theirs._”
2948,NEWSPAPER,]
2949,NEWSPAPER,
2950,NEWSPAPER,"This story stirred up TEDDY-G,"
2951,NEWSPAPER,"“You leave that show to me,” said he,"
2952,NEWSPAPER,“I’ll use my wit from nose to paw
2953,NEWSPAPER,To make more cash than you ever saw.”
2954,NEWSPAPER,"“I have a plan,” said TEDDY-B,"
2955,NEWSPAPER,“Let us run a paper just to see
2956,NEWSPAPER,If our sheet won’t sell like sixty-three.
2957,NEWSPAPER,We’ll fill each page with jolly stuff
2958,NEWSPAPER,And give the boys the greatest puff.
2959,NEWSPAPER,We’ll reuse the price and earn the pay
2960,NEWSPAPER,To build that home in half a day.”
2961,NEWSPAPER,So off they went to try their hand
2962,NEWSPAPER,At a job they didn’t understand:
2963,NEWSPAPER,"To edit, proof-read, print and sell"
2964,NEWSPAPER,A newspaper and do it well.
2965,NEWSPAPER,
2966,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
2967,NEWSPAPER,
2968,NEWSPAPER,The publisher took them all about
2969,NEWSPAPER,To show how a paper is gotten out.
2970,NEWSPAPER,They questioned every man they met
2971,NEWSPAPER,And with the manager made a bet
2972,NEWSPAPER,That they could put each page in rhyme
2973,NEWSPAPER,And get the paper out on time.
2974,NEWSPAPER,The bet was taken; the job was theirs;
2975,NEWSPAPER,A paper run by Teddy Bears
2976,NEWSPAPER,And they to have their own sweet way
2977,NEWSPAPER,With news and ads for a single day.
2978,NEWSPAPER,They said they’d do the best they could
2979,NEWSPAPER,And make a sheet that was bright and good.
2980,NEWSPAPER,
2981,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
2982,NEWSPAPER,
2983,NEWSPAPER,Of all the orders boys ever hear
2984,NEWSPAPER,"Who work on papers all the year,"
2985,NEWSPAPER,The orders given to the boys that night
2986,NEWSPAPER,Beat every record out of sight.
2987,NEWSPAPER,"They made the editors fume and frown,"
2988,NEWSPAPER,"And reporters chase all around the town,"
2989,NEWSPAPER,
2990,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
2991,NEWSPAPER,
2992,NEWSPAPER,"And telegraph instruments click in chime,"
2993,NEWSPAPER,"And telephone bells ring all the time,"
2994,NEWSPAPER,And linotypes go double speed
2995,NEWSPAPER,"And set up type big enough to read,"
2996,NEWSPAPER,"And advertisers fight for space,"
2997,NEWSPAPER,"And presses go at double pace,"
2998,NEWSPAPER,And everything hum on every floor
2999,NEWSPAPER,To beat all “scoops” ever made before.

3001,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
3002,NEWSPAPER,
3003,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
3004,NEWSPAPER,
3005,NEWSPAPER,But the paper was out on time next day:
3006,NEWSPAPER,"The greatest paper, newsboys say,"
3007,NEWSPAPER,That was ever printed in all the land
3008,NEWSPAPER,By the fastest press or done by hand.

3059,NEWSPAPER,When Teddy Bears would rulers be
3060,NEWSPAPER,And hunt for men in cave or tree
3061,NEWSPAPER,"With guide and gun, with horse and hound,"
3062,NEWSPAPER,In a Colorado hunting ground.
3063,NEWSPAPER,The advertisements made that night
3064,NEWSPAPER,Were what the printers call a fright:
3065,NEWSPAPER,"All shoved together, old and new,"
3066,NEWSPAPER,"Upside down and wrong side too,"
3067,NEWSPAPER,"Grocers had hats and caps for sale,"
3068,NEWSPAPER,"And tailors eggs, and barbers ale,"
3069,NEWSPAPER,"And department stores had railroad ads,"
3070,NEWSPAPER,"And big hotels sold writing pads,"
3071,NEWSPAPER,"And music stores sold soap and tea,"
3072,NEWSPAPER,"And theatres said admission free,"
3073,NEWSPAPER,"And a jeweller, the best in town,"
3074,NEWSPAPER,Offered cheap a wedding gown.
3075,NEWSPAPER,"A private school sold cheese and lard,"
3076,NEWSPAPER,And furniture was offered by the yard.
3077,NEWSPAPER,When TEDDY-B saw what was done
3078,NEWSPAPER,He said he thought ’twould make good fun.
3079,NEWSPAPER,"“For we mean,” said he, “to sell our sheet"
3080,NEWSPAPER,And every record sale to beat.”

3082,NEWSPAPER,[Illustration]
3083,NEWSPAPER,
3084,NEWSPAPER,"The papers sold at first for ten,"
3085,NEWSPAPER,But when approved by business men

3087,NEWSPAPER,And with papers in such brisk demand
3088,NEWSPAPER,You couldn’t get a single sheet
3089,NEWSPAPER,By ten o’clock upon the street.
3090,NEWSPAPER,The money made for the boys that day
3091,NEWSPAPER,Bought them a home with grounds to play
3092,NEWSPAPER,And enough to spare to give each lad
3093,NEWSPAPER,The jolliest time he ever had:
3094,NEWSPAPER,A fresh air week down by the sea
3095,NEWSPAPER,"With candy, cake and soda free."
3096,NEWSPAPER,
3097,NEWSPAPER,The Bears were glad when their work was done
3098,NEWSPAPER,"To start for the town of Washington,"

3121,WASHINGTON,
3122,WASHINGTON,When the Bears arrived in Washington
3123,WASHINGTON,They set out at once to buy a gun.
3124,WASHINGTON,They bought three guns and pistols ten
3125,WASHINGTON,And suits and belts like fighting men.
3126,WASHINGTON,When dressed complete then off they went
3127,WASHINGTON,To the house where lives the President.
3128,WASHINGTON,When they reached the grounds and the entrance
3129,WASHINGTON,gate
3130,WASHINGTON,No one was near to make them wait.
3131,WASHINGTON,The news had spread round everywheres
3132,WASHINGTON,Of this visit planned by the Roosevelt Bears.
3133,WASHINGTON,A policeman dodged behind a tree
3134,WASHINGTON,When he got first sight of TEDDY-B.
3135,WASHINGTON,Detectives wise with eagle eye
3136,WASHINGTON,"Didn’t stop to ask the reason why,"
3137,WASHINGTON,But ducked their heads behind a wall
3138,WASHINGTON,And got under cover one and all.
3139,WASHINGTON,A doorkeeper in gold and black
3140,WASHINGTON,"Said, “Wait a minute till I come back.”"
3141,WASHINGTON,
3142,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3143,WASHINGTON,
3144,WASHINGTON,And lawyers bold and statesmen brave
3145,WASHINGTON,Who make the President behave
3146,WASHINGTON,Moved out of sight as quick as wink;
3147,WASHINGTON,To offer help they didn’t think;
3148,WASHINGTON,"But they were hunters just the same,"
3149,WASHINGTON,Though hunting bears wasn’t quite their game.
3150,WASHINGTON,
3151,WASHINGTON,The boys who answer the call of bells
3152,WASHINGTON,Lost all the breath they use for yells
3153,WASHINGTON,In crossing lawns in serious fright;
3154,WASHINGTON,They rein for home with all their might.
3155,WASHINGTON,
3156,WASHINGTON,"And secretaries, three or four,"
3157,WASHINGTON,Got under desks down on the floor
3158,WASHINGTON,When they saw the Bears at the entrance door.
3159,WASHINGTON,
3160,WASHINGTON,But one little lad who was playing round
3161,WASHINGTON,"When he saw the Bears, he stood his ground"
3162,WASHINGTON,And stepped up bravely to TEDDY-G
3163,WASHINGTON,"And said, “Who is it you want to see?”"
3164,WASHINGTON,
3165,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3166,WASHINGTON,
3167,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-G in his kindliest way,"
3168,WASHINGTON,“We have traveled East and have come to-day
3169,WASHINGTON,To see the hunter who doesn’t scare
3170,WASHINGTON,And who isn’t afraid of man or bear.”
3171,WASHINGTON,
3172,WASHINGTON,"The Bears by the lad were keenly eyed,"
3173,WASHINGTON,And he said as he beckoned them both inside:
3174,WASHINGTON,“My Dad’s in here; but wipe your feet;
3175,WASHINGTON,I think you’re the kind he likes to meet.
3176,WASHINGTON,
3177,WASHINGTON,"They stepped inside, and the man they saw"
3178,WASHINGTON,Looked them over from head to paw
3179,WASHINGTON,And with outstretched hand and smiling face
3180,WASHINGTON,He gave them welcome to the place.
3181,WASHINGTON,
3182,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3183,WASHINGTON,
3184,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-G, when he caught his breath,"
3185,WASHINGTON,I thought this call meant certain death.
3186,WASHINGTON,We armed ourselves with loaded gun
3187,WASHINGTON,"When we struck this town of Washington,"
3188,WASHINGTON,For here ’twas said we’d surely see
3189,WASHINGTON,The man who chased bears up a tree
3190,WASHINGTON,And with both eyes shut on darkest night
3191,WASHINGTON,Could hit a bear and win a fight.”
3192,WASHINGTON,
3193,WASHINGTON,"“To stand your ground,” said TEDDY-B,"
3194,WASHINGTON,“Is the thing that we Bears like to see;
3195,WASHINGTON,"If fighting’s trump or simply fun,"
3196,WASHINGTON,"We stand, eyes front, and never run;"
3197,WASHINGTON,But those men of yours who guard your fort
3198,WASHINGTON,Should be taken West for a little sport
3199,WASHINGTON,And taught the things you learned out there
3200,WASHINGTON,When climbing mountains chasing bear.”
3201,WASHINGTON,
3202,WASHINGTON,But he simply laughed at what they said
3203,WASHINGTON,And joked of stories he had read
3204,WASHINGTON,In newspapers of things they’d done
3205,WASHINGTON,On their journey East to Washington.
3206,WASHINGTON,They talked away for an hour or two
3207,WASHINGTON,"Of hunting trips and friends they knew,"
3208,WASHINGTON,And this country wide and its cities great
3209,WASHINGTON,From Boston Hub to the Golden Gate.
3210,WASHINGTON,The Bears were asked to come next day
3211,WASHINGTON,At an early hour to have a play
3212,WASHINGTON,On the White House grounds and in children’s tent
3213,WASHINGTON,And to breakfast with the President.
3214,WASHINGTON,
3215,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3216,WASHINGTON,
3217,WASHINGTON,This visit o’er they started out
3218,WASHINGTON,To see the buildings all about:
3219,WASHINGTON,The Capitol with its rounded dome
3220,WASHINGTON,"Where the U. S. Senate makes its home,"
3221,WASHINGTON,And congressmen from every State
3222,WASHINGTON,Gather in halls to deliberate;
3223,WASHINGTON,"The Treasury with its vaults of gold,"
3224,WASHINGTON,"As much as a dozen trains could hold,"
3225,WASHINGTON,
3226,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3227,WASHINGTON,
3228,WASHINGTON,"And silver too, and crisp bank notes"
3229,WASHINGTON,Enough to load a hundred boats;
3230,WASHINGTON,The Library with its pictured halls
3231,WASHINGTON,And books stored high within its walls;
3232,WASHINGTON,
3233,WASHINGTON,"The gardens with their trees and flowers,"
3234,WASHINGTON,And a museum where they stayed for hours;
3235,WASHINGTON,"And last of all, built straight and high,"
3236,WASHINGTON,"A shaft that stands against the sky,"
3237,WASHINGTON,Set off with stones which good friends sent
3238,WASHINGTON,In memory of a president.

3246,WASHINGTON,]
3247,WASHINGTON,
3248,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3249,WASHINGTON,
3250,WASHINGTON,TEDDY-G said he would like to see
3251,WASHINGTON,That famous little cherry tree
3252,WASHINGTON,And get some cherries red and sweet
3253,WASHINGTON,To take back home to give a treat
3254,WASHINGTON,To the big raccoon and the mountain goat
3255,WASHINGTON,"And the old cougar and the young coyote,"
3256,WASHINGTON,To make them square and help them try
3257,WASHINGTON,To tell the truth and not to lie.
3258,WASHINGTON,
3259,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3260,WASHINGTON,
3261,WASHINGTON,So off they went that day at three
3262,WASHINGTON,Out in the country the farm to see
3263,WASHINGTON,Where George’s father used to stop
3264,WASHINGTON,And where the boy learned how to chop.
3265,WASHINGTON,They found the place as the guide books said
3266,WASHINGTON,"And the cherry stump, but no cherries red;"
3267,WASHINGTON,The stump was there and the hatchet too
3268,WASHINGTON,And neither looking very new.
3269,WASHINGTON,
3270,WASHINGTON,Said TEDDY-B when these things he saw
3271,WASHINGTON,And took the hatchet in his paw:
3272,WASHINGTON,“Of all the shrines of history
3273,WASHINGTON,Which you and I came East to see
3274,WASHINGTON,This spot right here I say is trump;
3275,WASHINGTON,This hatchet and this cherry stump.”
3276,WASHINGTON,
3277,WASHINGTON,TEDDY-G said he would like to try
3278,WASHINGTON,"Little George’s axe on a tree near-by,"
3279,WASHINGTON,To prove to the world that he could do
3280,WASHINGTON,A trick like that and own up too.
3281,WASHINGTON,And chop he did an apple tree
3282,WASHINGTON,"And left a note where all could see,"
3283,WASHINGTON,“This tree was chopped by TEDDY-G.”
3284,WASHINGTON,
3285,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3286,WASHINGTON,
3287,WASHINGTON,They breakfasted the following day
3288,WASHINGTON,With the President and had their play
3289,WASHINGTON,"For an hour before, from early dawn,"
3290,WASHINGTON,With boys and girls upon his lawn.
3291,WASHINGTON,They asked the President if he
3292,WASHINGTON,Would come out West their home to see;
3293,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-B, “We’ll treat you white"
3294,WASHINGTON,And put you up both day and night
3295,WASHINGTON,With grizzly bears and panthers wild
3296,WASHINGTON,And give you sport not quite so mild
3297,WASHINGTON,"As driving Congress with its load,"
3298,WASHINGTON,Or riding horseback down the road.”
3299,WASHINGTON,
3300,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3301,WASHINGTON,
3302,WASHINGTON,"“This strenuous life,” said TEDDY-G,"
3303,WASHINGTON,“Is too hard work by half for me;
3304,WASHINGTON,I’ll start back home this very day
3305,WASHINGTON,And for a month at home I’ll stay
3306,WASHINGTON,And rest my eyes and sleep and eat
3307,WASHINGTON,And get down again on all four feet.”
3308,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-B, “Our journey’s through;"
3309,WASHINGTON,There’s nothing left to see or do.
3310,WASHINGTON,We were treated well everywhere we went;
3311,WASHINGTON,And we have seen the President.
3312,WASHINGTON,"And now for home, that’s what I say;"
3313,WASHINGTON,But I mean to journey back this way
3314,WASHINGTON,To take a boat for London town
3315,WASHINGTON,To see the king and his golden crown.”
3316,WASHINGTON,The reporters called that afternoon
3317,WASHINGTON,When they heard the Bears were going so soon
3318,WASHINGTON,And begged a column at least of news
3319,WASHINGTON,About their trip and plans and views.
3320,WASHINGTON,TEDDY-B wrote out in boldest hand
3321,WASHINGTON,These lines that all can understand:
3322,WASHINGTON,
3323,WASHINGTON,"“To the boys we say be always gay,"
3324,WASHINGTON,And with jolly play fill every day.
3325,WASHINGTON,"Be brave, be true, be square and white,"
3326,WASHINGTON,And don’t forget to your friends to write.
3327,WASHINGTON,And to the girls: We’ve no advice;
3328,WASHINGTON,You’re everyone both sweet and nice.
3329,WASHINGTON,And to all the people whom we’ve met
3330,WASHINGTON,"Please say we leave, with much regret,"
3331,WASHINGTON,For our mountain cave and brook and tree.”
3332,WASHINGTON,
3333,WASHINGTON,Signed [Illustration: Teddy B] and [Illustration: Teddy G]
3334,WASHINGTON,
3335,WASHINGTON,As their train pulled out an army band
3336,WASHINGTON,Played airs well known o’er all the land;
3337,WASHINGTON,And boys and girls waved their good-byes.
3338,WASHINGTON,And tears filled many children’s eyes.
3339,WASHINGTON,TEDDY-B called back to the crowd that he
3340,WASHINGTON,Would come East again each one to see.
3341,WASHINGTON,And TEDDY-G said he’d do his best
3342,WASHINGTON,To treat them well if they came out West.

3352,WASHINGTON,
3353,WASHINGTON,
3354,WASHINGTON,[Illustration]
3355,WASHINGTON,
3356,WASHINGTON,As they crossed the country from East to West
3357,WASHINGTON,They stayed in their sleeping car to rest;
3358,WASHINGTON,And but once or twice looked out to see
3359,WASHINGTON,The towns passed through and country.
3360,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-G, “I’d like again"
3361,WASHINGTON,"To see that farm where we have been,"
3362,WASHINGTON,"And that country school and those boys at play,"
3363,WASHINGTON,For that was our very jolliest day.”
3364,WASHINGTON,"“What I wish most,” said TEDDY-B,"
3365,WASHINGTON,“Is when we get off this train that we
3366,WASHINGTON,Shall have those horses to carry our load
3367,WASHINGTON,Back over the hills on the mountain road.”
3368,WASHINGTON,
3369,WASHINGTON,The horses were there with saddle and rein
3370,WASHINGTON,"And met the Bears at the railway train,"
3371,WASHINGTON,And six mountain goats like baggage men
3372,WASHINGTON,Were there to help them to the glen.
3373,WASHINGTON,"As back they traveled that mountain road,"
3374,WASHINGTON,"The goats heaped high with the baggage load,"
3375,WASHINGTON,"And the Teddy Bears on broncho backs,"
3376,WASHINGTON,"Piled front and back with loaded sacks,"
3377,WASHINGTON,"They looked like bandits with their spoil,"
3378,WASHINGTON,"Or highwaymen after a day of toil,"
3379,WASHINGTON,Or perhaps more like true knights of old
3380,WASHINGTON,Returning home with captured gold.
3381,WASHINGTON,As they approached the place where they were born
3382,WASHINGTON,TEDDY-G blew loud on a trumpet horn
3383,WASHINGTON,"A West Point bugle call he knew,"
3384,WASHINGTON,"And a thousand friends came into view,"
3385,WASHINGTON,The Teddy Bears to greet with cheers
3386,WASHINGTON,By this animal camp of mountaineers;
3387,WASHINGTON,
3388,WASHINGTON,[Illustration:
3389,WASHINGTON,
3390,WASHINGTON,“_The Teddy Bears on Broncho backs piled front and back with loaded
3391,WASHINGTON,sacks._”
3392,WASHINGTON,]
3393,WASHINGTON,
3394,WASHINGTON,For the news had scattered far and wide
3395,WASHINGTON,"When the Bears would reach the mountain side,"
3396,WASHINGTON,And the crowd had come from far and near
3397,WASHINGTON,To welcome back two friends so dear.
3398,WASHINGTON,
3399,WASHINGTON,The old bobcat with the bandaged knee
3400,WASHINGTON,"Was the first to shake with TEDDY-B,"
3401,WASHINGTON,And a young cougar and a panther bold
3402,WASHINGTON,"Helped TEDDY-G his load to hold,"
3403,WASHINGTON,And two big-horn sheep and a mountain deer
3404,WASHINGTON,"Stood up on stumps to lead each cheer,"
3405,WASHINGTON,And hundreds more gave welcome hand
3406,WASHINGTON,To the most famous bears in all the land.
3407,WASHINGTON,
3408,WASHINGTON,They had gifts for each bought in the East
3409,WASHINGTON,"And they passed them round at the evening feast,"
3410,WASHINGTON,And then told stories for nights and days
3411,WASHINGTON,"About their trip and the city ways,"
3412,WASHINGTON,And the fun they had and the tricks they played
3413,WASHINGTON,"And the things they saw and where they stayed,"
3414,WASHINGTON,"And last and best, the time they spent"
3415,WASHINGTON,In Washington with the President.
3416,WASHINGTON,
3417,WASHINGTON,[Illustration:

3419,WASHINGTON,"“_They had gifts for each bought in the East, and they passed them"
3420,WASHINGTON,round at the evening feast._”
3421,WASHINGTON,]
3422,WASHINGTON,
3423,WASHINGTON,As the Bears turned in to their own home nest
3424,WASHINGTON,"And curled up snug for the winter’s rest,"
3425,WASHINGTON,"Said TEDDY-G, as he fell asleep,"
3426,WASHINGTON,“If I should pray for things to keep
3427,WASHINGTON,"Of what I’ve seen either East or West,"
3428,WASHINGTON,Its boys and girls I like the best.”
