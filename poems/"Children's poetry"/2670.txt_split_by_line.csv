20,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"Many years ago you used to rock me to sleep, cradling me in your"

22,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"that time, and I recall it with tenderness.  You were very"
23,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"beautiful then.  But you are more beautiful now; for, in the years"
24,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"that have come and gone since then, the joys and the sorrows of"
25,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,maternity have impressed their saintly grace upon the dear face I
26,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"used to kiss, and have made your gentle heart gentler still."
27,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,
28,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"Beloved lady, in memory of years to be recalled only in thought,"
29,LOVE-SONGS OF CHILDHOOD,"and in token of my gratitude and affection, I bring you these"

101,THE ROCK-A-BY LADY,

148,GARDEN AND CRADLE,Around his tinkling feet the sunbeams play;
149,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"The posies they are good to him,"
150,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"And bow them as they should to him,"
151,GARDEN AND CRADLE,As fareth he upon his kingly way;
152,GARDEN AND CRADLE,And birdlings of the wood to him
153,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"Make music, gentle music, all the day,"
154,GARDEN AND CRADLE,When our babe he goeth walking in his garden.
155,GARDEN AND CRADLE,
156,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"When our babe he goeth swinging in his cradle,"
157,GARDEN AND CRADLE,Then the night it looketh ever sweetly down;
158,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"The little stars are kind to him,"
159,GARDEN AND CRADLE,The moon she hath a mind to him
160,GARDEN AND CRADLE,And layeth on his head a golden crown;
161,GARDEN AND CRADLE,And singeth then the wind to him
162,GARDEN AND CRADLE,"A song, the gentle song of Bethlem-town,"
163,GARDEN AND CRADLE,When our babe he goeth swinging in his cradle.

168,THE NIGHT WIND,THE NIGHT WIND
169,THE NIGHT WIND,
170,THE NIGHT WIND,"Have you ever heard the wind go ""Yooooo""?"
171,THE NIGHT WIND,'T is a pitiful sound to hear!
172,THE NIGHT WIND,It seems to chill you through and through
173,THE NIGHT WIND,With a strange and speechless fear.
174,THE NIGHT WIND,'T is the voice of the night that broods outside
175,THE NIGHT WIND,"When folk should be asleep,"
176,THE NIGHT WIND,And many and many's the time I've cried
177,THE NIGHT WIND,To the darkness brooding far and wide
178,THE NIGHT WIND,Over the land and the deep:
179,THE NIGHT WIND,"""Whom do you want, O lonely night,"
180,THE NIGHT WIND,"That you wail the long hours through?"""
181,THE NIGHT WIND,And the night would say in its ghostly way:
182,THE NIGHT WIND,"""Yoooooooo!"
183,THE NIGHT WIND,Yoooooooo!
184,THE NIGHT WIND,"Yoooooooo!"""
185,THE NIGHT WIND,
186,THE NIGHT WIND,My mother told me long ago
187,THE NIGHT WIND,(When I was a little tad)
188,THE NIGHT WIND,"That when the night went wailing so,"
189,THE NIGHT WIND,Somebody had been bad;
190,THE NIGHT WIND,"And then, when I was snug in bed,"
191,THE NIGHT WIND,"Whither I had been sent,"
192,THE NIGHT WIND,"With the blankets pulled up round my head,"
193,THE NIGHT WIND,"I'd think of what my mother'd said,"
194,THE NIGHT WIND,And wonder what boy she meant!
195,THE NIGHT WIND,"And ""Who's been bad to-day?"" I'd ask"
196,THE NIGHT WIND,"Of the wind that hoarsely blew,"
197,THE NIGHT WIND,And the voice would say in its meaningful way:
198,THE NIGHT WIND,"""Yoooooooo!"
199,THE NIGHT WIND,Yoooooooo!
200,THE NIGHT WIND,"Yoooooooo!"""
201,THE NIGHT WIND,
202,THE NIGHT WIND,That this was true I must allow--
203,THE NIGHT WIND,"You'll not believe it, though!"
204,THE NIGHT WIND,"Yes, though I'm quite a model now,"
205,THE NIGHT WIND,I was not always so.
206,THE NIGHT WIND,"And if you doubt what things I say,"
207,THE NIGHT WIND,Suppose you make the test;
208,THE NIGHT WIND,"Suppose, when you've been bad some day"
209,THE NIGHT WIND,And up to bed are sent away
210,THE NIGHT WIND,From mother and the rest--
211,THE NIGHT WIND,"Suppose you ask, ""Who has been bad?"""
212,THE NIGHT WIND,And then you'll hear what's true;
213,THE NIGHT WIND,For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone:
214,THE NIGHT WIND,"""Yoooooooo!"
215,THE NIGHT WIND,Yoooooooo!
216,THE NIGHT WIND,"Yoooooooo!"""

222,KISSING TIME,
223,KISSING TIME,'T is when the lark goes soaring
224,KISSING TIME,"And the bee is at the bud,"
225,KISSING TIME,When lightly dancing zephyrs
226,KISSING TIME,Sing over field and flood;
227,KISSING TIME,When all sweet things in nature
228,KISSING TIME,Seem joyfully achime--
229,KISSING TIME,"'T is then I wake my darling,"

233,KISSING TIME,"And suck your sweets, O bee;"
234,KISSING TIME,"Sing, O ye winds of summer,"
235,KISSING TIME,Your songs to mine and me;
236,KISSING TIME,For with your song and rapture
237,KISSING TIME,Cometh the moment when
238,KISSING TIME,It's half-past kissing time
239,KISSING TIME,And time to kiss again!
240,KISSING TIME,
241,KISSING TIME,So--so the days go fleeting
242,KISSING TIME,"Like golden fancies free,"
243,KISSING TIME,And every day that cometh
244,KISSING TIME,Is full of sweets for me;
245,KISSING TIME,And sweetest are those moments
246,KISSING TIME,My darling comes to climb
247,KISSING TIME,Into my lap to mind me
248,KISSING TIME,That it is kissing time.

250,KISSING TIME,"Sometimes, maybe, he wanders"

252,KISSING TIME,"Sometimes, maybe, he loiters"
253,KISSING TIME,"In pretty, prattling play;"
254,KISSING TIME,But presently bethinks him
255,KISSING TIME,"And hastens to me then,"
256,KISSING TIME,For it's half-past kissing time
257,KISSING TIME,And time to kiss again!

320,BEARD AND BABY,"Our baby woos me with her prattle,"
321,BEARD AND BABY,"And, perching proudly on my knee,"
322,BEARD AND BABY,She gives my petted whiskers battle.
323,BEARD AND BABY,
324,BEARD AND BABY,"With both her hands she tugs away,"
325,BEARD AND BABY,While scolding at me kind o' spiteful;
326,BEARD AND BABY,You'll not believe me when I say
327,BEARD AND BABY,I find the torture quite delightful!
328,BEARD AND BABY,
329,BEARD AND BABY,"No other would presume, I ween,"
330,BEARD AND BABY,"To trifle with this hirsute wonder,"
331,BEARD AND BABY,Else would I rise in vengeful mien

343,BEARD AND BABY,
344,BEARD AND BABY,"Yes, heavenly music seems to steal"

358,THE DINKEY BIRD,"It's their playing, romping, swinging,"
359,THE DINKEY BIRD,That give great joy to me
360,THE DINKEY BIRD,While the Dinkey-Bird goes singing
361,THE DINKEY BIRD,In the amfalula tree!
362,THE DINKEY BIRD,
363,THE DINKEY BIRD,"There the gum-drops grow like cherries,"
364,THE DINKEY BIRD,And taffy's thick as peas--
365,THE DINKEY BIRD,Caramels you pick like berries
366,THE DINKEY BIRD,"When, and where, and how you please;"
367,THE DINKEY BIRD,Big red sugar-plums are clinging
368,THE DINKEY BIRD,To the cliffs beside that sea
369,THE DINKEY BIRD,Where the Dinkey-Bird is singing
370,THE DINKEY BIRD,In the amfalula tree.
371,THE DINKEY BIRD,
372,THE DINKEY BIRD,So when children shout and scamper
373,THE DINKEY BIRD,"And make merry all the day,"
374,THE DINKEY BIRD,When there's naught to put a damper
375,THE DINKEY BIRD,To the ardor of their play;
376,THE DINKEY BIRD,"When I hear their laughter ringing,"
377,THE DINKEY BIRD,Then I'm sure as sure can be
378,THE DINKEY BIRD,That the Dinkey-Bird is singing
379,THE DINKEY BIRD,In the amfalula tree.
380,THE DINKEY BIRD,
381,THE DINKEY BIRD,For the Dinkey-Bird's bravuras
382,THE DINKEY BIRD,And staccatos are so sweet--
383,THE DINKEY BIRD,"His roulades, appoggiaturas,"
384,THE DINKEY BIRD,"And robustos so complete,"
385,THE DINKEY BIRD,That the youth of every nation--
386,THE DINKEY BIRD,Be they near or far away--
387,THE DINKEY BIRD,Have especial delectation
388,THE DINKEY BIRD,In that gladsome roundelay.

391,THE DINKEY BIRD,"Their lungs begin to crow,"
392,THE DINKEY BIRD,"Their hearts get light and lighter,"
393,THE DINKEY BIRD,And their cheeks are all aglow;
394,THE DINKEY BIRD,For an echo cometh bringing
395,THE DINKEY BIRD,"The news to all and me,"
396,THE DINKEY BIRD,That the Dinkey-Bird is singing
397,THE DINKEY BIRD,In the amfalula tree.
398,THE DINKEY BIRD,
399,THE DINKEY BIRD,I'm sure you like to go there
400,THE DINKEY BIRD,To see your feathered friend--
401,THE DINKEY BIRD,And so many goodies grow there
402,THE DINKEY BIRD,You would like to comprehend!
403,THE DINKEY BIRD,"Speed, little dreams, your winging"
404,THE DINKEY BIRD,To that land across the sea
405,THE DINKEY BIRD,Where the Dinkey-Bird is singing
406,THE DINKEY BIRD,In the amfalula tree!

413,THE DRUM,"I'm a beautiful red, red drum,"
414,THE DRUM,And I train with the soldier boys;

421,THE DRUM,With a r-r-rat-tat-tat
422,THE DRUM,And a tum-titty-um-tum-tum--
423,THE DRUM,"Oh, there's bushels of fun in that"
424,THE DRUM,For boys with a little red drum!
425,THE DRUM,
426,THE DRUM,The Injuns came last night
427,THE DRUM,"While the soldiers were abed,"
428,THE DRUM,And they gobbled a Chinese kite
429,THE DRUM,And off to the woods they fled!
430,THE DRUM,The woods are the cherry-trees
431,THE DRUM,"Down in the orchard lot,"
432,THE DRUM,And the soldiers are marching to seize
433,THE DRUM,The booty the Injuns got.
434,THE DRUM,"With tum-titty-um-tum-tum,"
435,THE DRUM,"And r-r-rat-tat-tat,"
436,THE DRUM,When soldiers marching come
437,THE DRUM,Injuns had better scat!
438,THE DRUM,
439,THE DRUM,"Step up there, little Fred,"
440,THE DRUM,"And, Charley, have a mind!"
441,THE DRUM,Jim is as far ahead
442,THE DRUM,As you two are behind!
443,THE DRUM,Ready with gun and sword
444,THE DRUM,Your valorous work to do--
445,THE DRUM,Yonder the Injun horde
446,THE DRUM,Are lying in wait for you.
447,THE DRUM,And their hearts go pitapat
448,THE DRUM,When they hear the soldiers come
449,THE DRUM,With a r-r-rat-tat-tat
450,THE DRUM,And a tum-titty-um-tum-tum!
451,THE DRUM,
452,THE DRUM,Course it's all in play!
453,THE DRUM,The skulking Injun crew
454,THE DRUM,That hustled the kite away
455,THE DRUM,"Are little white boys, like you!"
456,THE DRUM,"But ""honest"" or ""just in fun,"""
457,THE DRUM,It is all the same to me;
458,THE DRUM,"And, when the battle is won,"
459,THE DRUM,Home once again march we
460,THE DRUM,With a r-r-rat-tat-tat
461,THE DRUM,And tum-titty-um-tum-tum;

469,THE DEAD BABE,
470,THE DEAD BABE,"Last night, as my dear babe lay dead,"
471,THE DEAD BABE,In agony I knelt and said:
472,THE DEAD BABE,"""O God! what have I done,"
473,THE DEAD BABE,"Or in what wise offended Thee,"
474,THE DEAD BABE,That Thou should'st take away from me
475,THE DEAD BABE,My little son?
476,THE DEAD BABE,
477,THE DEAD BABE,"""Upon the thousand useless lives,"
478,THE DEAD BABE,"Upon the guilt that vaunting thrives,"
479,THE DEAD BABE,Thy wrath were better spent!
480,THE DEAD BABE,Why should'st Thou take my little son--
481,THE DEAD BABE,Why should'st Thou vent Thy wrath upon
482,THE DEAD BABE,"This innocent?"""
483,THE DEAD BABE,
484,THE DEAD BABE,"Last night, as my dear babe lay dead,"
485,THE DEAD BABE,Before mine eyes the vision spread
486,THE DEAD BABE,Of things that might have been:
487,THE DEAD BABE,"Licentious riot, cruel strife,"
488,THE DEAD BABE,"Forgotten prayers, a wasted life"
489,THE DEAD BABE,Dark red with sin!
490,THE DEAD BABE,
491,THE DEAD BABE,"Then, with sweet music in the air,"
492,THE DEAD BABE,I saw another vision there:
493,THE DEAD BABE,A Shepherd in whose keep
494,THE DEAD BABE,A little lamb--my little child!
495,THE DEAD BABE,"Of worldly wisdom undefiled,"
496,THE DEAD BABE,Lay fast asleep!
497,THE DEAD BABE,
498,THE DEAD BABE,"Last night, as my dear babe lay dead,"
499,THE DEAD BABE,In those two messages I read
500,THE DEAD BABE,A wisdom manifest;
501,THE DEAD BABE,"And though my arms be childless now,"
502,THE DEAD BABE,I am content--to Him I bow
503,THE DEAD BABE,Who knoweth best.

631,THE DUEL,Nor one nor t' other had slept a wink!
632,THE DUEL,The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate
633,THE DUEL,Appeared to know as sure as fate
634,THE DUEL,There was going to be a terrible spat.
635,THE DUEL,(I wasn't there; I simply state
636,THE DUEL,What was told to me by the Chinese plate!)
637,THE DUEL,
638,THE DUEL,"The gingham dog went ""bow-wow-wow!"""
639,THE DUEL,"And the calico cat replied ""mee-ow!"""
640,THE DUEL,"The air was littered, an hour or so,"
641,THE DUEL,"With bits of gingham and calico,"
642,THE DUEL,While the old Dutch clock in the chimney place
643,THE DUEL,"Up with its hands before its face,"
644,THE DUEL,For it always dreaded a family row!

652,THE DUEL,Employing every tooth and claw

1252,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Saddled and bridled for Bumpville;
1253,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"Leap to the back of this steed, if you dare,"
1254,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,And gallop away to Bumpville!
1255,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"I hope you'll be sure to sit fast in your seat,"
1256,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"For this calico mare is prodigiously fleet,"
1257,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,And many adventures you're likely to meet
1258,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,As you journey along to Bumpville.
1259,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,
1260,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,This calico mare both gallops and trots
1261,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,While whisking you off to Bumpville;
1262,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"She paces, she shies, and she stumbles, in spots,"
1263,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,In the tortuous road to Bumpville;
1264,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,And sometimes this strangely mercurial steed
1265,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"Will suddenly stop and refuse to proceed,"
1266,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"Which, all will admit, is vexatious indeed,"
1267,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,When one is en route to Bumpville!
1268,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,
1269,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"She's scared of the cars when the engine goes ""Toot!"""
1270,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Down by the crossing at Bumpville;
1271,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,You'd better look out for that treacherous brute
1272,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Bearing you off to Bumpville!
1273,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"With a snort she rears up on her hindermost heels,"
1274,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,And executes jigs and Virginia reels--
1275,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Words fail to explain how embarrassed one feels
1276,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Dancing so wildly to Bumpville!
1277,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,

1283,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"There are rivers to ford, there are fences to jump,"
1284,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"And the corduroy road it goes bumpytybump,"
1285,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Mile after mile to bumpville!
1286,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,
1287,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,Perhaps you'll observe it's no easy thing
1288,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"Making the journey to Bumpville,"
1289,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"So I think, on the whole, it were prudent to bring"
1290,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,An end to this ride to Bumpville;
1291,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"For, though she has uttered no protest or plaint,"
1292,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,The calico mare must be blowing and faint--
1293,THE RIDE TO BUMPVILLE,"What's more to the point, I'm blowed if I ain't!"

1314,THE BROOK,"The rushes are dead in the old-time place,"
1315,THE BROOK,And the willows I knew when a child was I.
1316,THE BROOK,"And the brook it seemeth to me to say,"
