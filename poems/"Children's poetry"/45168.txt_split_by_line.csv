66,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
67,PREFACE.,
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,"It is with feelings of great humility, from a sense of her own"
70,PREFACE.,"deficiency in the important duties of a mother, that the writer of the"
71,PREFACE.,following rhymes submits them to the public. Her wish is to convey a
72,PREFACE.,"few useful hints to nurse-maids, as well as to those mothers who have"
73,PREFACE.,had but little experience in the care of children.
74,PREFACE.,
75,PREFACE.,"Many young mothers, more especially in the middle circles of life, have"
76,PREFACE.,"scarcely leisure to make education a study; while others, perhaps,"
77,PREFACE.,do not reflect on the very great importance of early habits; to such
78,PREFACE.,"persons, the few practical observations contained in the notes, may"
79,PREFACE.,not be unacceptable.
80,PREFACE.,
81,PREFACE.,"The subjection of the will, in the first place, by _mild_ yet firm and"
82,PREFACE.,"persevering conduct, will generally ensure success to the parent, and"
83,PREFACE.,will save the child _hours_ and even _days_ of fretfulness and sorrow.
84,PREFACE.,
85,PREFACE.,The employment of a nurse-maid is a responsible one; those who really
86,PREFACE.,"perform their duty from pure and conscientious motives, will not lose"
87,PREFACE.,their reward; and though such may feel _themselves_ to be placed in
88,PREFACE.,"a very humble situation, they are, in reality, laying the foundation"
89,PREFACE.,"for future happiness or misery. In the first three years of childhood,"
90,PREFACE.,that basis is often formed upon which the conduct of future life is
91,PREFACE.,"built. If self-will, and a spirit of contradiction, be allowed to take"
92,PREFACE.,"deep root in the infant mind, Divine Grace _only_ can counteract their"
93,PREFACE.,"evils. But, on the other hand, if good feelings be cherished, and the"
94,PREFACE.,"evil passions (which _all_ have more or less, by nature,) be gradually"
95,PREFACE.,"subjected, early blossoms of virtue will appear; and, by the blessing"
96,PREFACE.,"of Providence, those beautiful fruits will be matured, by which the"
97,PREFACE.,"tree may be known to be good; and by which, from the cradle to the"
98,PREFACE.,"grave, the designs of the benevolent Creator will be accomplished."

103,PREFACE.,
104,PREFACE.,"The writer only wishes to say, that these rhymes were undertaken at"
105,PREFACE.,"the particular request of a valued friend of hers, who has bestowed"
106,PREFACE.,"much of his time, with truly benevolent intentions, in adding to the"
107,PREFACE.,instruction and amusement of the rising generation; and she cannot but
108,PREFACE.,acknowledge the obligation she feels for the kind assistance he has
109,PREFACE.,lent her in several of the subjects which occupy the following pages.
110,PREFACE.,
111,PREFACE.,"The design of the writer is, that _each piece_ shall convey some"
112,PREFACE.,"hint which may tend to the physical or moral advantage of the child,"
113,PREFACE.,"in those duties which immediately devolve upon a mother, and her"
114,PREFACE.,"nurse-maid; so that, while they are amusing their little ones with the"
115,PREFACE.,"recital of a simple narrative, adapted to the most humble capacity,"
116,PREFACE.,they may sometimes be pleasantly reminded of their own obligations.

304,A WALK IN THE COUNTRY.,
305,A WALK IN THE COUNTRY.,NOTE.--Children are sent out into the country for the benefit of
