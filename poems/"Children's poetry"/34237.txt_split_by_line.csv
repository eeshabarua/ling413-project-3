622,INTRODUCTION,
623,INTRODUCTION,
624,INTRODUCTION,"There is no doubt, I fear, that certain people are born without, as"
625,INTRODUCTION,"certain other people are born with, a love of poetry. Any natural gift"
626,INTRODUCTION,"is a great advantage, of course, be it physical, mental, or spiritual."
627,INTRODUCTION,The dear old tales which suggest the presence of fairies at the cradle
628,INTRODUCTION,"of the new-born child, dealing out, not very impartially, talents,"
629,INTRODUCTION,"charms, graces, are not so far from the real truth. You may have been"
630,INTRODUCTION,"given a straight nose, a rosy cheek, a courteous manner, a lively wit, a"
631,INTRODUCTION,"generous disposition; but perhaps the Fairy Fine-Ear, who hears the"
632,INTRODUCTION,"grass grow, and the leaf-buds throb, had a pressing engagement at"
633,INTRODUCTION,somebody else's cradle-side when you most needed her benefactions. There
634,INTRODUCTION,"is another elf too, a Dame o' Dreams; she is clad all in color-of-rose,"
635,INTRODUCTION,and when she touches your eyelids you see visions forever after;
636,INTRODUCTION,"beautiful haunting things hidden from duller eyes, visions made of stars"
637,INTRODUCTION,and dew and magic. Never any great poet lived but these two fairies were
638,INTRODUCTION,"present at his birth, and it may be that they stole a moment to visit"
639,INTRODUCTION,"you. If such was the case you love, need, crave poetry, to understand"
640,INTRODUCTION,"yourself, your neighbor, the world, God; and you will find that nothing"
641,INTRODUCTION,"else will satisfy you so completely as the years go on. If, on the other"
642,INTRODUCTION,"hand, these highly mythical but interesting personages were absent when"
643,INTRODUCTION,"the question of your natural endowment was being settled, do not take it"
644,INTRODUCTION,"too much to heart, but try to make good the deficiencies."
645,INTRODUCTION,
646,INTRODUCTION,You must have liked the rhymes and jingles of your nursery-days:

654,INTRODUCTION,How does your garden grow?
655,INTRODUCTION,
656,INTRODUCTION,"I am certain you remember what pleasure it gave you to make ""contrary"""
657,INTRODUCTION,"rhyme with ""Mary"" instead of pronouncing it in the proper and prosy way."
658,INTRODUCTION,
659,INTRODUCTION,"""But"" you answer, ""I did indeed like that sort of verse, and am still"
660,INTRODUCTION,"fond of it when it dances and prances, or trips and patters and tinkles;"
661,INTRODUCTION,"it is what is termed ""sublime"" poetry that is dull and difficult to"
662,INTRODUCTION,understand; the verb is always a long distance from its subject; the
663,INTRODUCTION,"punctuation comes in the middle of the lines, so that it reads like"
664,INTRODUCTION,"prose in spite of one, and it is generally sprinkled with allusions to"
665,INTRODUCTION,"Calypso, Oedipus, Eurydice, Hesperus, Corydon, Arethusa, and the"
666,INTRODUCTION,Acroceraunian Mountains; or at any rate with people and places which one
667,INTRODUCTION,"has to look up in the atlas and dictionary."""
668,INTRODUCTION,
669,INTRODUCTION,"Of course, all poems are not equally simple in sound and sense. It does"
670,INTRODUCTION,"not require much intelligence to read or chant Poe's Raven, and if one"
671,INTRODUCTION,"does not quite understand it, one is so taken captive by the weird,"
672,INTRODUCTION,"haunting music of the lines, the recurrence of phrases and repetition of"
673,INTRODUCTION,"words, that one does not think about its meaning:"
674,INTRODUCTION,
675,INTRODUCTION,"""While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
676,INTRODUCTION,"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
677,INTRODUCTION,"''Tis some visitor, I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door--"

680,INTRODUCTION,"The moment, however, that your eye falls upon the following lines from"
681,INTRODUCTION,"""Paradise Lost"" you confess privately that if you were obliged to parse"

689,INTRODUCTION,"They sat them down;"""
690,INTRODUCTION,
691,INTRODUCTION,"Very well then, do not try to parse them; Paradise Lost was not written"
692,INTRODUCTION,exclusively for the grammarians; content yourself with enjoying the
693,INTRODUCTION,"picture; the frisking of the beasts of the earth, while Adam and Eve"
694,INTRODUCTION,watched them from a fountain-side in Paradise.
695,INTRODUCTION,
696,INTRODUCTION,"No one need be ashamed of liking a good deal of rhyme and rhythm, swing"
697,INTRODUCTION,"and movement and melody in poetry; absolute perfection of form, though"
698,INTRODUCTION,"all too rarely attained, is one of the chief delights of the"
699,INTRODUCTION,"verse-lover. ""_The procession of beautiful sounds that is a poem,_"" says"
700,INTRODUCTION,Walter Raleigh. It is quite natural to love the music of verse before
701,INTRODUCTION,"you catch the deeper thought, and you feel, in some of the greatest"
702,INTRODUCTION,"poetry, as if only the angels could have put the melodious words"
703,INTRODUCTION,together. There is more in this music than meets the eye or ear; it is
704,INTRODUCTION,"what differentiates prose from poetry, which, to quote Wordsworth, is"
705,INTRODUCTION,the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge. Prose it is said can never
706,INTRODUCTION,"be too truthful or too wise, but song is more than mere Truth and"
707,INTRODUCTION,"Wisdom, it is the ""rose upon Truth's lips, the light in Wisdom's eyes."""
708,INTRODUCTION,That is why the thought in it finds its way to the very heart of one and
709,INTRODUCTION,"makes one glow and tremble, fills one with desire to do some splendid"
710,INTRODUCTION,"action, right some wrong, be something other than one is, more noble,"
711,INTRODUCTION,"more true, more patient, more courageous."
712,INTRODUCTION,
713,INTRODUCTION,We who have selected the poems in this book have had to keep in mind the
714,INTRODUCTION,various kinds of young people who are to read it. The boys may wish that
715,INTRODUCTION,"there were more story and battle poems, and verses ringing with spirited"
716,INTRODUCTION,and war-like adventures; the girls may think that there are too many
717,INTRODUCTION,"already; while both, perhaps, may miss certain old favorites like"
718,INTRODUCTION,"Horatius or The Ancient Mariner, omitted because of their great length."
719,INTRODUCTION,Some of you will yawn if the book flies open at Milton; some will be
720,INTRODUCTION,bored whenever they chance upon Pope; others will never read Wordsworth
721,INTRODUCTION,"except on compulsion. Romantic little maids will turn away from ""Tacking"
722,INTRODUCTION,"Ship off Shore,"" while their brothers will disdain ""The Swan's Nest"
723,INTRODUCTION,"Among the Reeds""; but it was necessary to make the book for all sorts"
724,INTRODUCTION,"and conditions of readers, and such a volume must contain a taste of the"
725,INTRODUCTION,"best things, whether your special palate is ready for them or not. When"
726,INTRODUCTION,"you are twenty-one you may say, loftily, ""I do not care for Pope and"
727,INTRODUCTION,"Dryden, I prefer Spenser and Tennyson, or Ben Jonson and Herrick,"" or"
728,INTRODUCTION,"whatever you really do prefer,--but now, although, of course, you have"
729,INTRODUCTION,"your personal likes and dislikes, you cannot be sure that they are based"
730,INTRODUCTION,on anything real or that they will stand the test of time and
731,INTRODUCTION,experience.
732,INTRODUCTION,
733,INTRODUCTION,"So you will find between these covers we hope, a little of everything"
734,INTRODUCTION,"good, for we have searched the pages of the great English-speaking poets"
735,INTRODUCTION,"to find verses that you would either love at first sight, or that you"
736,INTRODUCTION,would grow to care for as you learn what is worthy to be loved. Where we
737,INTRODUCTION,"found one beautiful verse, quite simple and wholly beautiful, we have"
738,INTRODUCTION,"given you that, if it held a complete thought or painted a picture"
739,INTRODUCTION,"perfect in itself, even although we omitted the very next one, which"
740,INTRODUCTION,perhaps would have puzzled and wearied the younger ones with its
741,INTRODUCTION,involved construction or difficult phraseology.
742,INTRODUCTION,
743,INTRODUCTION,"Will you think, I wonder, that this very simple talk is too informal to"
744,INTRODUCTION,be quite proper when one remembers that it is to serve as introduction
745,INTRODUCTION,to the greatest poets that ever lived? Informality is very charming in
746,INTRODUCTION,"its place, no doubt (for so the thought might cross your mind), but one"
747,INTRODUCTION,"does not use it with kings and queens; still the least things, you know,"
748,INTRODUCTION,"may sometimes explain or interpret the greatest. The brook might say, ""I"
749,INTRODUCTION,"am nothing in myself, I know, but I am showing you the way to the ocean;"
750,INTRODUCTION,"follow on if you wish to see something really vast and magnificent."""
751,INTRODUCTION,
752,INTRODUCTION,There are besides gracious courtesies to be observed on certain
753,INTRODUCTION,occasions. If a famous poet or author should chance to come to your
754,INTRODUCTION,"village or city and appear before the people, someone would have to"
755,INTRODUCTION,introduce the stranger and commend him to your attention; and if he did
756,INTRODUCTION,it modestly it would only be an act of kindliness; a wish to serve you
757,INTRODUCTION,and at the same time bespeak for him a gentle and a friendly hearing.
758,INTRODUCTION,"Once introduced--Presto, change! If he is a great poet he is a great"
759,INTRODUCTION,"wizard; the words he uses, the method and manner in which he uses them,"
760,INTRODUCTION,"the cadence of his verse, the thoughts he calls to your mind, the way he"
761,INTRODUCTION,"brings the quick color to your cheek and the tear to your eye, all these"
762,INTRODUCTION,"savor of magic, nothing else. Who could be less than modest in his"
763,INTRODUCTION,presence? Who could but wish to bring the whole world under his spell?
764,INTRODUCTION,"You will readily be modest, too, when you confront these splendid poems,"
765,INTRODUCTION,even although some of you may not wholly comprehend as yet their
766,INTRODUCTION,grandeur and their majesty; may not fully understand their claim to
767,INTRODUCTION,immortality. Where is there a girl who would not make a low curtsey to
768,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare's Silvia, Milton's Sabrina, Wordsworth's Lucy, or Mrs."
769,INTRODUCTION,Browning's Elizabeth? And if there is a boy who could stand with his
770,INTRODUCTION,"head covered before Horatius, Hervé Riel, Sir Launfal, or Motherwell's"
771,INTRODUCTION,Cavalier he is not one of those we had in mind when we made this book.
772,INTRODUCTION,Neither is it altogether the personality of hero or heroine that fills
773,INTRODUCTION,us with reverence; it is the beauty and perfection of the poem itself
774,INTRODUCTION,that almost brings us to our knees in worship. A little later on you
775,INTRODUCTION,"will have the same feeling of admiration and awe for Shelley's Skylark,"
776,INTRODUCTION,"Emerson's Snow Storm, Wordsworth's Daffodils, Keats's Daybreak, and for"
777,INTRODUCTION,"many another poem not included in this book, to which you must hope to"
778,INTRODUCTION,"grow. For it is a matter of growth after all, and growth, in mind and"
779,INTRODUCTION,"spirit, as in body, is largely a matter of will. It is all ours, the"
780,INTRODUCTION,beauty in the world: your task is merely to enter into possession.
781,INTRODUCTION,"Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare are yours as much as another's. The"
782,INTRODUCTION,great treasury of inspiring thoughts that has been heaped together as
783,INTRODUCTION,"the ages went by, that ""rich deposit of the centuries,"" is your"
784,INTRODUCTION,heritage; if you wish to assert your heirship no one can say you nay; if
785,INTRODUCTION,"you will to be a Croesus in the things of the mind and spirit, no one"
786,INTRODUCTION,can ever keep you poor.
787,INTRODUCTION,
788,INTRODUCTION,"We have brought you only English verse, so you must wait for the years"
789,INTRODUCTION,"to give you Homer, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Schiller, Victor Hugo, and"
790,INTRODUCTION,many another; and of English verse we have only given a hint of the
791,INTRODUCTION,treasures in store for you later on.
792,INTRODUCTION,
793,INTRODUCTION,"We have quoted you poems from the grand old masters, those ""bards"
794,INTRODUCTION,"sublime,"""
795,INTRODUCTION,
796,INTRODUCTION,"""Whose distant footsteps echo"
797,INTRODUCTION,"Through the corridors of Time,"""
798,INTRODUCTION,
799,INTRODUCTION,and many a verse:--
800,INTRODUCTION,
801,INTRODUCTION,"--""from some humbler poet"
802,INTRODUCTION,Whose songs gushed from his heart
803,INTRODUCTION,"As showers from the clouds of summer,"
804,INTRODUCTION,Or tears from the eyelids start;
805,INTRODUCTION,"Who through long days of labor,"
806,INTRODUCTION,"And nights devoid of ease,"
807,INTRODUCTION,Still heard in his soul the music
808,INTRODUCTION,"Of wonderful melodies."""
809,INTRODUCTION,
810,INTRODUCTION,"Since you will not like everything in the book equally well, may we"
811,INTRODUCTION,"advise you how to use it? First find something you know and love, and"
812,INTRODUCTION,"read it over again. (Penitent, indeed, shall we be if it has been"
813,INTRODUCTION,omitted!) The meeting will be like one with a dear playfellow and friend
814,INTRODUCTION,"in a new and strange house, and the house will seem less strange after"
815,INTRODUCTION,you have met and welcomed the friend.
816,INTRODUCTION,
817,INTRODUCTION,Then search the pages until you see a verse that speaks to you
818,INTRODUCTION,"instantly, catches your eye, begs you to read it, willy-nilly. There are"
819,INTRODUCTION,"dozens of such poems in this collection, as simple as if they had been"
820,INTRODUCTION,written for six-year-olds instead of for the grown-up English-speaking
821,INTRODUCTION,"world: little masterpieces like Tennyson's Brook, Kingsley's Clear and"
822,INTRODUCTION,"Cool, Shakespeare's Fairy Songs, Burns's Mountain Daisy, Emerson's"
823,INTRODUCTION,"Rhodora, Motherwell's Blithe Bird, Hogg's Skylark, Wordsworth's Pet"
824,INTRODUCTION,"Lamb, Scott's Ballads, and scores of others."
825,INTRODUCTION,
826,INTRODUCTION,"This so far is pure pleasure, but why not, as another step, find"
827,INTRODUCTION,"something difficult, something you instinctively draw back from? It will"
828,INTRODUCTION,"probably be Milton, Pope, Dryden, Browning, or Shelley. You cannot find"
829,INTRODUCTION,"any ""story"" in it; its rhymes do not run trippingly off the tongue;"
830,INTRODUCTION,"there are a few strange and unpronounceable words, the punctuation and"
831,INTRODUCTION,"phrasing puzzle you, and worse than all you are obliged to read it two"
832,INTRODUCTION,"or three times before you really understand its meaning. Very well, that"
833,INTRODUCTION,"is nothing to be ashamed of, and you surely do not want to be vanquished"
834,INTRODUCTION,"by a difficulty. You will realize some time or other that all learning,"
835,INTRODUCTION,"like all life, is a sort of obstacle race in which the strongest wins."
836,INTRODUCTION,
837,INTRODUCTION,I once said to a dear old minister who was preaching to a very ignorant
838,INTRODUCTION,"and unlearned congregation, ""It must be very difficult, sir, for you to"
839,INTRODUCTION,"preach down to them""; for he was a man of rare scholarship and true"
840,INTRODUCTION,"wisdom;--""I try to be very simple a part of the time,"" he answered, ""but"
841,INTRODUCTION,not always; about once a month I fling the fodder so high in the rack
842,INTRODUCTION,"that no man can catch at a single straw without stretching his neck!"""
843,INTRODUCTION,
844,INTRODUCTION,"Now pray do not laugh at that illustration; smile if you will, but it"
845,INTRODUCTION,serves the purpose. Just as we develop our muscles by exercising our
846,INTRODUCTION,"bodies, so do we grow strong mentally and spiritually by this"
847,INTRODUCTION,"""stretching"" process. You are not obliged to love an impersonal, remote,"
848,INTRODUCTION,"or complex poem intimately and passionately, but read it faithfully if"
849,INTRODUCTION,you do not wish to be wholly blind and deaf to beauties of sense or
850,INTRODUCTION,"sound that happier people see and hear. Joubert says most truly: ""You"
851,INTRODUCTION,"will find poetry nowhere unless you bring some with you,"" but there are"
852,INTRODUCTION,some splendid things in verse as in prose that you stand in too great
853,INTRODUCTION,"awe of to love in any real, childlike way. It is never scenes from"
854,INTRODUCTION,Paradise Lost that run through your mind when you are going to sleep. It
855,INTRODUCTION,"is something with a lilt, like:"
856,INTRODUCTION,
857,INTRODUCTION,"""Up the airy mountain,"
858,INTRODUCTION,"Down the rushy glen,"
859,INTRODUCTION,We daren't go a-hunting
860,INTRODUCTION,"For fear of little men;"""
861,INTRODUCTION,
862,INTRODUCTION,"or a poem with a gallant action in it like Marco Bozzaris, or with a"
863,INTRODUCTION,"charming story like The Singing Leaves, or a mysterious and musical one,"
864,INTRODUCTION,"like Kubla Khan or The Bells, or something that when first you read it"
865,INTRODUCTION,"made you a little older and a little sadder, in an odd, unaccustomed way"
866,INTRODUCTION,quite unlike that of real grief:
867,INTRODUCTION,
868,INTRODUCTION,"""A feeling of sadness and longing"
869,INTRODUCTION,That is not akin to pain
870,INTRODUCTION,And resembles sorrow only
871,INTRODUCTION,"As the mist resembles rain."""
872,INTRODUCTION,
873,INTRODUCTION,When you read that verse of Longfellow's afterwards you see that he has
874,INTRODUCTION,"expressed your mood exactly. That is what it means to be a poet, and"
875,INTRODUCTION,"that is what poetry is always doing for us; revealing, translating"
876,INTRODUCTION,"thoughts we are capable of feeling, but not expressing."
877,INTRODUCTION,
878,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps you will not for a long time see the beauty of certain famous
879,INTRODUCTION,"reflective poems like Gray's Elegy, but we must include a few of such"
880,INTRODUCTION,"things whether they appeal to you very strongly or not, merely because"
881,INTRODUCTION,"it is necessary that you should have an acquaintance, if not a"
882,INTRODUCTION,"friendship, with lines that the world by common consent has agreed to"
883,INTRODUCTION,"call immortal. They show you, without your being conscious of it, show"
884,INTRODUCTION,"you by their lines ""all gold and seven times refined,""--how beautiful"
885,INTRODUCTION,the English language can be when it is used by a master of style. Young
886,INTRODUCTION,"people do not think or talk very much about style, but they come under"
887,INTRODUCTION,its spell unconsciously and respond to its influence quickly enough. To
888,INTRODUCTION,give a sort of definition: style is a way of saying or writing a thing
889,INTRODUCTION,so that people are _compelled to listen._ When you grow sensitive to
890,INTRODUCTION,"beauty of language you become, in some small degree at least, capable of"
891,INTRODUCTION,"using it yourself. You could not, for instance, read daily these"
892,INTRODUCTION,"""honey-tongued"" poets without gathering a little sweetness for your own"
893,INTRODUCTION,unruly member.
894,INTRODUCTION,
895,INTRODUCTION,There are certain spiritual lessons to be gained from many of these
896,INTRODUCTION,"immortal poems, lessons which the oldest as well as the youngest might"
897,INTRODUCTION,well learn. Turn to Milton's Ode on his Blindness. It is not easy
898,INTRODUCTION,"reading, but you will begin to care for it when experience brings you"
899,INTRODUCTION,"the meaning of the line, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" It"
900,INTRODUCTION,is one of a class of poems that have been living forces from age to age;
901,INTRODUCTION,"that have quickened aspiration, aroused energy, deepened conviction;"
902,INTRODUCTION,that have infused a nobler ardor and loftier purpose into life wherever
903,INTRODUCTION,and whenever they were read.
904,INTRODUCTION,
905,INTRODUCTION,Prefacing each of the divisions of this volume you will find a page or
906,INTRODUCTION,"""interleaf"" of comment on, and appreciation of, the poems that follow."
907,INTRODUCTION,These pages you may read or not as you are minded; they are only
908,INTRODUCTION,friendly or informal letters from an old traveller to a pilgrim who has
909,INTRODUCTION,just taken his staff in hand.
910,INTRODUCTION,
911,INTRODUCTION,"By and by you will add poem after poem to your list of favorites, and"
912,INTRODUCTION,"so, gradually, you will make your own volume of Golden Numbers, which"
913,INTRODUCTION,will be far better than any book we can fashion for you. Perhaps you
914,INTRODUCTION,"will copy single verses and whole poems in it and, later, learn them by"
915,INTRODUCTION,"heart. Such treasures of memory ""will henceforth no longer be"
916,INTRODUCTION,"forgettable, detachable parts of your mind's furniture, but well-springs"
917,INTRODUCTION,"of instinct forever."""

934,INTERLEAVES,"Here is the Year's Processional in verse; the story of her hours, her"
935,INTERLEAVES,"days, her seasons, told as only poets can, because they see and hear"
936,INTERLEAVES,"things not revealed to you and me, and are able by their magic to make"
937,INTERLEAVES,us sharers in the revelation. Read the first six poems and ask yourself
938,INTERLEAVES,whether you have ever realized the glories of the common day; from the
939,INTERLEAVES,"moment when morning from her orient chambers comes, and the lark at"
940,INTERLEAVES,"heaven's gate sings, to the hour when the moon, unveiling her peerless"
941,INTERLEAVES,"light, throws her silver mantle o'er the dark, and the firmament glows"
942,INTERLEAVES,with living sapphires.
943,INTERLEAVES,
944,INTERLEAVES,"It is the task of poetry not only to say noble things, but to say them"
945,INTERLEAVES,"nobly; having beautiful fancies, to clothe them in beautiful phrases,"
946,INTERLEAVES,and if you search these poems you will find some of the most wonderful
947,INTERLEAVES,word-pictures in the English language. How charming Drayton's
948,INTERLEAVES,description of the summer breeze:
949,INTERLEAVES,
950,INTERLEAVES,"""_The wind had no more strength than this,"
951,INTERLEAVES,"That leisurely it blew,"

954,INTERLEAVES,

3952,PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY.,"""Must I thank you then,"" said the king, ""Sir Lark,"

5353,INTERLEAVES,Most of these songs come to you from the masters of English poetry.
5354,INTERLEAVES,"Nations, like individuals, have their ""play-spells,"" and Shakespeare,"
5355,INTERLEAVES,"Drayton, and ""rare Ben Jonson"" belong to that wonderful age of Elizabeth"
5356,INTERLEAVES,when more than ten score of poets were making England a veritable nest
5357,INTERLEAVES,of singing-birds.
5358,INTERLEAVES,
5359,INTERLEAVES,Dowden says of the exquisite songs scattered through Shakespeare's
5360,INTERLEAVES,"plays, that if they do not make their own way, like the notes in the"
5361,INTERLEAVES,"wildwood, no words will open the dull ear to take them in. Of Drayton we"
5362,INTERLEAVES,"give you here ""The Arming of Pigwiggen,"" from ""Nymphidia,"" and later on"
5363,INTERLEAVES,"""The Battle of Agincourt,"" called, respectively, the best fantastic poem"
5364,INTERLEAVES,and the best war poem in the language.
5365,INTERLEAVES,
5366,INTERLEAVES,Then comes Milton the sublime; Milton set apart among poets; so that the
5367,INTERLEAVES,"adjective Miltonic has come to be a synonym for gravity, loftiness, and"
5368,INTERLEAVES,"majesty. After Milton, Dryden, often called the greatest poet of a"
5369,INTERLEAVES,little age; but if he lacked the true sublimity he reverenced in the
5370,INTERLEAVES,"great Puritan, he was still the first, and perhaps the greatest, master"
5371,INTERLEAVES,"of satirical poetry. Then, more than half a century afterward, comes"
5372,INTERLEAVES,Coleridge with his dreamy grace and his touch of the supernatural; his
5373,INTERLEAVES,"marvellous poetic gift, of sudden blossoming and sad and premature"
5374,INTERLEAVES,"decay. Contemporary with Coleridge was Shelley, the master singer of his"

5377,INTERLEAVES,
5378,INTERLEAVES,When these two voices were hushed the Victorian era was dawning and the

5381,INTERLEAVES,"insight, and nobility of thought, gave his name to the Tennysonian age."

6239,X,"He had fallen to the ground outright,"
6240,X,"For rugged and dim was his onward track,"
6241,X,"But there came a spotted toad in sight,"
6242,X,And he laughed as he jumped upon her back:
6243,X,"He bridled her mouth with a silkweed twist,"
6244,X,He lashed her sides with an osier thong;
6245,X,"And now, through evening's dewy mist,"

6428,II,And I should look like a fountain of gold
6429,II,Springing alone
6430,II,"With a shrill inner sound,"
6431,II,Over the throne
6432,II,In the midst of the hall;
6433,II,Till that great sea-snake under the sea
6434,II,From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps
6435,II,Would slowly trail himself sevenfold
6436,II,"Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate"
6437,II,With his large calm eyes for the love of me.
6438,II,And all the mermen under the sea
6439,II,Would feel their immortality
6440,II,Die in their hearts for the love of me.
6441,II,
6442,III,III
6443,III,
6444,III,"But at night I would wander away, away,"
6445,III,"I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,"
6446,III,And lightly vault from the throne and play
6447,III,With the mermen in and out of the rocks;
6448,III,"We would run to and fro, and hide and seek,"
6449,III,"On the broad sea-wolds in the crimson shells,"
6450,III,Whose silvery spikes are nearest the sea.
6451,III,"But if any came near I would call and shriek,"
6452,III,And adown the steep like a wave I would leap
6453,III,From the diamond ledges that jut from the dells;
6454,III,"For I would not be kiss'd by all who would list,"
6455,III,Of the bold merry mermen under the sea;
6456,III,"They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,"
6457,III,In the purple twilights under the sea;
6458,III,"But the king of them all would carry me,"
6459,III,"Woo me, win me, and marry me,"
6460,III,In the branching jaspers under the sea;
6461,III,Then all the dry pied things that be
6462,III,In the hueless mosses under the sea
6463,III,"Would curl round my silver feet silently,"
6464,III,All looking up for the love of me.
6465,III,And if I should carol aloud from aloft
6466,III,All things that are forked and horned and soft
6467,III,"Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,"
6468,III,All looking down for the love of me.

6771,INTERLEAVES,
6772,INTERLEAVES,"In ancient tapestries, centuries old, you sometimes see, wrought in"
6773,INTERLEAVES,"delicate needlework that is faded with the lapse of years, pictures of"
6774,INTERLEAVES,the sports of the period. There will be quaint scenes showing otter and
6775,INTERLEAVES,"bear hunting, swans' nesting, hawking, chasing the deer, and the like;"
6776,INTERLEAVES,"in-door scenes, too, depicting pretty pages strumming musical"
6777,INTERLEAVES,"instruments, and lovely ladies at their tambour or 'broidery frames."
6778,INTERLEAVES,
6779,INTERLEAVES,The poetry of each passing age preserves pictures of its plays and
6780,INTERLEAVES,"diversions still more perfectly than worn and tattered tapestry, and the"
6781,INTERLEAVES,verses we have chosen cover a bewildering variety of pastimes and
6782,INTERLEAVES,recreations. The poets have sounded the praises of almost every kind of
6783,INTERLEAVES,"sport: angling, swimming, skating, bubble-blowing, going a-Maying,"
6784,INTERLEAVES,"walking, riding, whittling, nutting, the country pleasures of ""the"
6785,INTERLEAVES,"barefoot boy,"" the joys of reading, the delights of music, and the"
6786,INTERLEAVES,exhilarations of cruising and travelling. One poem of the immediate
6787,INTERLEAVES,"present, Beeching's ""Bicycling Song,"" shows us that the sport of the"
6788,INTERLEAVES,moment need not of necessity be too commonplace to be wrought into
6789,INTERLEAVES,verse. At first thought the amusements of these latter days are so swift
6790,INTERLEAVES,"and breathless, so complicated with steam, electricity, and other great"
6791,INTERLEAVES,"forces of the new era, that they seem less poetic than the picturesque"
6792,INTERLEAVES,"frolics of milkmaids and shepherds, the games of the old Greeks or the"
6793,INTERLEAVES,"gay sports of the days of chivalry. But after all, as Lowell said,"
6794,INTERLEAVES,"""there is as much poetry in the iron horses that eat fire as in those of"
6795,INTERLEAVES,"Diomed that fed on men. If you cut an apple across, you may trace in it"

11595,THOMAS GRAY.,Of creature more tractable none ever heard;
11596,THOMAS GRAY.,In the height of her speed she would stop at a word;
11597,THOMAS GRAY.,"But again with a word, when the curate said, ""Hey,"""
11598,THOMAS GRAY.,She put forth her mettle and gallop'd away.
11599,THOMAS GRAY.,
11600,THOMAS GRAY.,"As near to the gates of the city he rode,"

11602,THOMAS GRAY.,"The good priest discover'd, with eyes of desire,"
11603,THOMAS GRAY.,A mulberry tree in a hedge of wild brier;
11604,THOMAS GRAY.,"On boughs long and lofty, in many a green shoot,"
11605,THOMAS GRAY.,"Hung, large, black and glossy, the beautiful fruit."
11606,THOMAS GRAY.,
11607,THOMAS GRAY.,The curate was hungry and thirsty to boot;
11608,THOMAS GRAY.,"He shrunk from the thorns, though he long'd for the fruit;"
11609,THOMAS GRAY.,"With a word he arrested his courser's keen speed,"
11610,THOMAS GRAY.,And he stood up erect on the back of his steed;
11611,THOMAS GRAY.,"On the saddle he stood while the creature stood still,"
11612,THOMAS GRAY.,And he gather'd the fruit till he took his good fill.
11613,THOMAS GRAY.,
11614,THOMAS GRAY.,"""Sure never,"" he thought, ""was a creature so rare,"

11620,THOMAS GRAY.,
11621,THOMAS GRAY.,"He stood with his head in the mulberry tree,"

11623,THOMAS GRAY.,"At the sound of the word the good mare made a push,"
11624,THOMAS GRAY.,And down went the priest in the wild-brier bush.
11625,THOMAS GRAY.,"He remember'd too late, on his thorny green bed,"

11719,JOHN GAY.,
11720,JOHN GAY.,"My sister and my sister's child,"

11738,JOHN GAY.,"Which is both bright and clear."""
11739,JOHN GAY.,
11740,JOHN GAY.,John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife;
11741,JOHN GAY.,O'erjoyed was he to find
11742,JOHN GAY.,"That though on pleasure she was bent,"
11743,JOHN GAY.,She had a frugal mind.
11744,JOHN GAY.,
11745,JOHN GAY.,"The morning came, the chaise was brought,"
11746,JOHN GAY.,But yet was not allow'd
11747,JOHN GAY.,"To drive up to the door, lest all"
11748,JOHN GAY.,Should say that she was proud.
11749,JOHN GAY.,
11750,JOHN GAY.,"So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,"
11751,JOHN GAY.,Where they did all get in;
11752,JOHN GAY.,"Six precious souls, and all agog"
11753,JOHN GAY.,To dash through thick and thin.
11754,JOHN GAY.,
11755,JOHN GAY.,"Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,"
11756,JOHN GAY.,"Were never folk so glad,"

11759,JOHN GAY.,
11760,JOHN GAY.,"John Gilpin at his horse's side,"
11761,JOHN GAY.,"Seized fast the flowing mane,"
11762,JOHN GAY.,"And up he got, in haste to ride,"

11764,JOHN GAY.,"For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,"
11765,JOHN GAY.,"His journey to begin,"
11766,JOHN GAY.,"When, turning round his head, he saw"
11767,JOHN GAY.,Three customers come in.
11768,JOHN GAY.,
11769,JOHN GAY.,"So down he came; for loss of time,"
11770,JOHN GAY.,"Although it grieved him sore,"

11782,JOHN GAY.,"When I do exercise."""
11783,JOHN GAY.,
11784,JOHN GAY.,"Now mistress Gilpin, careful soul!"
11785,JOHN GAY.,"Had two stone bottles found,"
11786,JOHN GAY.,"To hold the liquor that she loved,"
11787,JOHN GAY.,And keep it safe and sound.
11788,JOHN GAY.,
11789,JOHN GAY.,"Each bottle had a curling ear,"
11790,JOHN GAY.,"Through which the belt he drew,"
11791,JOHN GAY.,"And hung a bottle on each side,"
11792,JOHN GAY.,To make his balance true.
11793,JOHN GAY.,
11794,JOHN GAY.,"Then over all, that he might be"
11795,JOHN GAY.,"Equipp'd from top to toe,"
11796,JOHN GAY.,"His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,"
11797,JOHN GAY.,He manfully did throw.
11798,JOHN GAY.,
11799,JOHN GAY.,Now see him mounted once again
11800,JOHN GAY.,"Upon his nimble steed,"
11801,JOHN GAY.,Full slowly pacing o'er the stones
11802,JOHN GAY.,With caution and good heed.
11803,JOHN GAY.,
11804,JOHN GAY.,"But, finding soon a smoother road"
11805,JOHN GAY.,"Beneath his well-shod feet,"
11806,JOHN GAY.,"The snorting beast began to trot,"
11807,JOHN GAY.,"Which gall'd him in his seat,"
11808,JOHN GAY.,
11809,JOHN GAY.,"So ""Fair and softly,"" John he cried,"
11810,JOHN GAY.,But John he cried in vain;
11811,JOHN GAY.,"That trot became a gallop soon,"
11812,JOHN GAY.,In spite of curb and rein.
11813,JOHN GAY.,
11814,JOHN GAY.,"So stooping down, as needs he must"
11815,JOHN GAY.,"Who cannot sit upright,"
11816,JOHN GAY.,"He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,"
11817,JOHN GAY.,And eke with all his might.
11818,JOHN GAY.,
11819,JOHN GAY.,"His horse, who never in that sort"
11820,JOHN GAY.,"Had handled been before,"
11821,JOHN GAY.,What thing upon his back had got
11822,JOHN GAY.,Did wonder more and more.
11823,JOHN GAY.,
11824,JOHN GAY.,"Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,"
11825,JOHN GAY.,Away went hat and wig!
11826,JOHN GAY.,He little dreamt when he set out
11827,JOHN GAY.,Of running such a rig!
11828,JOHN GAY.,
11829,JOHN GAY.,"The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,"
11830,JOHN GAY.,"Like streamer long and gay,"
11831,JOHN GAY.,"Till, loop and button failing both,"
11832,JOHN GAY.,At last it flew away.
11833,JOHN GAY.,
11834,JOHN GAY.,Then might all people well discern
11835,JOHN GAY.,The bottles he had slung;
11836,JOHN GAY.,"A bottle swinging at each side,"
11837,JOHN GAY.,As hath been said or sung.
11838,JOHN GAY.,
11839,JOHN GAY.,"The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,"
11840,JOHN GAY.,"Up flew the windows all,"
11841,JOHN GAY.,"And ev'ry soul cried out, ""Well done!"""
11842,JOHN GAY.,As loud as he could bawl.
11843,JOHN GAY.,
11844,JOHN GAY.,Away went Gilpin--who but he?
11845,JOHN GAY.,His fame soon spread around--
11846,JOHN GAY.,"""He carries weight!"" ""He rides a race!"""
11847,JOHN GAY.,"""'T is for a thousand pound!"""
11848,JOHN GAY.,
11849,JOHN GAY.,"And still, as fast as he drew near,"
11850,JOHN GAY.,"'T was wonderful to view,"
11851,JOHN GAY.,How in a trice the turnpike-men
11852,JOHN GAY.,Their gates wide open threw.
11853,JOHN GAY.,
11854,JOHN GAY.,"And now, as he went bowing down"
11855,JOHN GAY.,"His reeking head full low,"
11856,JOHN GAY.,The bottles twain behind his back
11857,JOHN GAY.,Were shattered at a blow.
11858,JOHN GAY.,
11859,JOHN GAY.,"Down ran the wine into the road,"
11860,JOHN GAY.,"Most piteous to be seen,"
11861,JOHN GAY.,Which made his horse's flanks to smoke
11862,JOHN GAY.,As they had basted been.
11863,JOHN GAY.,
11864,JOHN GAY.,"But still he seem'd to carry weight,"
11865,JOHN GAY.,"With leathern girdle braced,"
11866,JOHN GAY.,For all might see the bottle-necks
11867,JOHN GAY.,Still dangling at his waist.
11868,JOHN GAY.,
11869,JOHN GAY.,Thus all through merry Islington
11870,JOHN GAY.,"These gambols he did play,"
11871,JOHN GAY.,Until he came unto the Wash
11872,JOHN GAY.,Of Edmonton so gay.
11873,JOHN GAY.,
11874,JOHN GAY.,And there he threw the Wash about
11875,JOHN GAY.,"On both sides of the way,"
11876,JOHN GAY.,"Just like unto a trundling mop,"
11877,JOHN GAY.,Or a wild-goose at play.
11878,JOHN GAY.,
11879,JOHN GAY.,At Edmonton his loving wife
11880,JOHN GAY.,From the balcony spied
11881,JOHN GAY.,"Her tender husband, wond'ring much"
11882,JOHN GAY.,To see how he did ride.
11883,JOHN GAY.,
11884,JOHN GAY.,"""Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house!"""
11885,JOHN GAY.,They all at once did cry;
11886,JOHN GAY.,"""The dinner waits and we are tired:"""
11887,JOHN GAY.,"Said Gilpin--""So am I!"""
11888,JOHN GAY.,
11889,JOHN GAY.,But yet his horse was not a whit
11890,JOHN GAY.,Inclined to tarry there;
11891,JOHN GAY.,For why?--his owner had a house
11892,JOHN GAY.,"Full ten miles off, at Ware,"
11893,JOHN GAY.,"So like an arrow swift he flew,"
11894,JOHN GAY.,Shot by an archer strong;
11895,JOHN GAY.,So did he fly--which brings me to
11896,JOHN GAY.,The middle of my song.
11897,JOHN GAY.,
11898,JOHN GAY.,"Away went Gilpin, out of breath."
11899,JOHN GAY.,"And sore against his will,"
11900,JOHN GAY.,Till at his friend the Calender's
11901,JOHN GAY.,His horse at last stood still.
11902,JOHN GAY.,
11903,JOHN GAY.,"The Calender, amazed to see"
11904,JOHN GAY.,"His neighbour in such trim,"
11905,JOHN GAY.,"Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,"
11906,JOHN GAY.,And thus accosted him:--
11907,JOHN GAY.,
11908,JOHN GAY.,"""What news? what news? your tidings tell,"
11909,JOHN GAY.,Tell me you must and shall--
11910,JOHN GAY.,"Say why bare-headed you are come,"
11911,JOHN GAY.,"Or why you come at all?"""
11912,JOHN GAY.,
11913,JOHN GAY.,"Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,"
11914,JOHN GAY.,"And loved a timely joke,"
11915,JOHN GAY.,And thus unto the Calender
11916,JOHN GAY.,In merry guise he spoke:--
11917,JOHN GAY.,
11918,JOHN GAY.,"""I came because your horse would come;"
11919,JOHN GAY.,"And if I well forebode,"
11920,JOHN GAY.,"My hat and wig will soon be here,"
11921,JOHN GAY.,"They are upon the road."""
11922,JOHN GAY.,
11923,JOHN GAY.,"The Calender, right glad to find"
11924,JOHN GAY.,"His friend in merry pin,"
11925,JOHN GAY.,"Returned him not a single word,"
11926,JOHN GAY.,But to the house went in;
11927,JOHN GAY.,
11928,JOHN GAY.,"Whence straight he came with hat and wig,"
11929,JOHN GAY.,"A wig that flow'd behind,"
11930,JOHN GAY.,"A hat not much the worse for wear,"
11931,JOHN GAY.,Each comely in its kind.
11932,JOHN GAY.,
11933,JOHN GAY.,"He held them up, and in his turn"
11934,JOHN GAY.,Thus show'd his ready wit:--
11935,JOHN GAY.,"""My head is twice as big as yours,"
11936,JOHN GAY.,They therefore needs must fit.
11937,JOHN GAY.,
11938,JOHN GAY.,But let me scrape the dirt away
11939,JOHN GAY.,That hangs upon your face;
11940,JOHN GAY.,"And stop and eat, for well you may"
11941,JOHN GAY.,"Be in a hungry case."""
11942,JOHN GAY.,
11943,JOHN GAY.,"Said John--""It is my wedding-day,"
11944,JOHN GAY.,"And all the world would stare,"
11945,JOHN GAY.,"If wife should dine at Edmonton,"
11946,JOHN GAY.,"And I should dine at Ware."""
11947,JOHN GAY.,
11948,JOHN GAY.,"So, turning to his horse, he said--"
11949,JOHN GAY.,"""I am in haste to dine;"
11950,JOHN GAY.,"'T was for your pleasure you came here,"
11951,JOHN GAY.,"You shall go back for mine."""
11952,JOHN GAY.,
11953,JOHN GAY.,"Ah, luckless speech and bootless boast!"
11954,JOHN GAY.,For which he paid full dear;
11955,JOHN GAY.,"For, while he spake, a braying ass"
11956,JOHN GAY.,Did sing most loud and clear;
11957,JOHN GAY.,"Whereat his horse did snort, as he"
11958,JOHN GAY.,"Had heard a lion roar,"
11959,JOHN GAY.,"And gallop'd off with all his might,"
11960,JOHN GAY.,As he had done before.
11961,JOHN GAY.,
11962,JOHN GAY.,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
11963,JOHN GAY.,Went Gilpin's hat and wig!
11964,JOHN GAY.,"He lost them sooner than at first,"
11965,JOHN GAY.,For why?--they were too big!
11966,JOHN GAY.,
11967,JOHN GAY.,"Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw"
11968,JOHN GAY.,Her husband posting down
11969,JOHN GAY.,"Into the country far away,"
11970,JOHN GAY.,She pull'd out half-a-crown;
11971,JOHN GAY.,
11972,JOHN GAY.,And thus unto the youth she said

13267,III,
13268,III,"And the first Leaf, when it was opened,"
13269,III,"Sang: ""I am Walter the page,"

13947,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,There she sees the highway near
13948,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Winding down to Camelot;
13949,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"There the river eddy whirls,"
13950,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And there the surly village churls,"
13951,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And the red cloaks of market-girls,"
13952,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Pass onward from Shalott.
13953,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
13954,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,"
13955,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"An abbot on an ambling pad,"
13956,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Sometimes a curly shepherd lad,"
13957,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Or long-haired page in crimson clad,"

13959,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And sometimes thro' the mirror blue
13960,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The knights come riding two and two:

13962,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Lady of Shalott.
13963,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
13964,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,But in her web she still delights
13965,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"To weave the mirror's magic sights,"
13966,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,For often thro' the silent nights
13967,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"A funeral, with plumes and lights."
13968,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And music, went to Camelot:"
13969,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Or when the moon was overhead,"
13970,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Came two young lovers lately wed;
13971,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"""I am half sick of shadows,"" said"

13976,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,"

13979,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And flamed upon the brazen greaves
13980,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Of bold Sir Lancelot.
13981,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,A red-cross knight forever kneeled
13982,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"To a lady in his shield,"

13990,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,As he rode down to Camelot:
13991,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And from his blazoned baldric slung
13992,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"A mighty silver bugle hung,"
13993,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And as he rode his armor rung,"
13994,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Beside remote Shalott.
13995,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
13996,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,All in the blue unclouded weather
13997,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Thick-jewelled shone the saddle-leather,"
13998,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The helmet and the helmet-feather
13999,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Burned like one burning flame together,"
14000,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,As he rode down to Camelot.
14001,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"As often through the purple night,"
14002,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Below the starry clusters bright,"

14005,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
14006,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,His broad clear brow in sunlight glowed;
14007,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,On burnished hooves his war-horse trode;
14008,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,From underneath his helmet flowed
14009,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"His coal-black curls as on he rode,"
14010,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,As he rode down to Camelot.
14011,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,From the bank and from the river
14012,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"He flashed into the crystal mirror,"

14018,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"She saw the water lily bloom,"
14019,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"She saw the helmet and the plume,"
14020,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,She looked down to Camelot.
14021,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Out flew the web and floated wide;
14022,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The mirror cracked from side to side;
14023,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"""The curse is come upon me,"" cried"

14030,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"The broad stream in his banks complaining,"
14031,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Heavily the low sky raining
14032,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Over towered Camelot;
14033,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Down she came and found a boat
14034,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Beneath a willow left afloat,"
14035,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And round about the prow she wrote,"
14036,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,_The Lady of Shalott._
14037,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
14038,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And down the river's dim expanse--
14039,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Like some bold seër in a trance,"
14040,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Seeing all his own mischance--
14041,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,With a glassy countenance
14042,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Did she look to Camelot.
14043,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And at the closing of the day
14044,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"She loosed the chain, and down she lay;"
14045,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"The broad stream bore her far away,"
14046,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Lady of Shalott.
14047,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
14048,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Lying, robed in snowy white"
14049,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,That loosely flew to left and right--
14050,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The leaves upon her falling light--
14051,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Thro' the noises of the night
14052,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,She floated down to Camelot:
14053,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,And as the boat-head wound along
14054,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"The willowy hills and fields among,"
14055,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"They heard her singing her last song,"
14056,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Lady of Shalott.
14057,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,
14058,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Heard a carol, mournful, holy,"
14059,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,"
14060,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Till her blood was frozen slowly,"
14061,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"And her eyes were darkened wholly,"
14062,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,Turned to towered Camelot;
14063,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,For ere she reached upon the tide
14064,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"The first house by the water-side,"
14065,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"Singing in her song she died,"
14066,SIR WALTER SCOTT.,The Lady of Shalott.

15073,BAYARD TAYLOR.,The freed dove flew to the Rajah's tower--
15074,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Fled from the slaughter of Moslem kings--
15075,BAYARD TAYLOR.,And the thorns have covered the city of Gaur.
15076,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"Dove--dove--oh, homing dove!"
15077,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"Little white traitor, with woe on thy wings!"
15078,BAYARD TAYLOR.,
15079,BAYARD TAYLOR.,The Rajah of Dacca rode under the wall;
15080,BAYARD TAYLOR.,He set in his bosom a dove of flight--
15081,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"""If she return, be sure that I fall."""
15082,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"Dove--dove--oh, homing dove!"
15083,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Pressed to his heart in the thick of the fight.

15085,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"""Fire the palace, the fort, and the keep--"

15094,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"And the dove--the dove--oh, the homing dove!"
15095,BAYARD TAYLOR.,She thought of her cote on the palace wall.
15096,BAYARD TAYLOR.,
15097,BAYARD TAYLOR.,She opened her wings and she flew away--
15098,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Fluttered away beyond recall;
15099,BAYARD TAYLOR.,She came to the palace at break of day.
15100,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"Dove--dove--oh, homing dove!"
15101,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Flying so fast for a kingdom's fall.
15102,BAYARD TAYLOR.,
15103,BAYARD TAYLOR.,The Queens of Dacca they slept in flame--
15104,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Slept in the flame of the palace old--
15105,BAYARD TAYLOR.,To save their honour from Moslem shame.
15106,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"And the dove--the dove--oh, the homing dove!"
15107,BAYARD TAYLOR.,She cooed to her young where the smoke-cloud rolled.
15108,BAYARD TAYLOR.,
15109,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"The Rajah of Dacca rode far and fleet,"
15110,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"Followed as fast as a horse could fly,"
15111,BAYARD TAYLOR.,He came and the palace was black at his feet;
15112,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"And the dove--the dove--oh, the homing dove!"
15113,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Circled alone in the stainless sky.
15114,BAYARD TAYLOR.,
15115,BAYARD TAYLOR.,So the dove flew to the Rajah's tower--
15116,BAYARD TAYLOR.,Fled from the slaughter of Moslem kings;
15117,BAYARD TAYLOR.,"So the thorns covered the city of Gaur,"
15118,BAYARD TAYLOR.,And Dacca was lost for a white dove's wings.

15129,I,The Abbot of Inisfalen
15130,I,Awoke ere dawn of day;
15131,I,Under the dewy green leaves
15132,I,Went he forth to pray.
15133,I,
15134,I,The lake around his island
15135,I,"Lay smooth and dark and deep,"
15136,I,"And, wrapt in a misty stillness,"
15137,I,The mountains were all asleep.
15138,I,
15139,I,"Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac,"
15140,I,When the dawn was dim and gray;
15141,I,The prayers of his holy office
15142,I,He faithfully 'gan say.
15143,I,
15144,I,"Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac,"
15145,I,"When the dawn was waxing red,"
15146,I,And for his sins' forgiveness
15147,I,A solemn prayer he said.
15148,I,
15149,I,Low kneel'd that holy Abbot
15150,I,When the dawn was waxing clear;
15151,I,And he pray'd with loving-kindness
15152,I,For his convent brethren dear.
15153,I,
15154,I,"Low kneel'd that blessed Abbot,"
15155,I,When the dawn was waxing bright;
15156,I,"He pray'd a great prayer for Ireland,"
15157,I,He pray'd with all his might.
15158,I,
15159,I,"Low kneel'd that good old father,"
15160,I,While the sun began to dart;
15161,I,"He pray'd a prayer for all mankind,"
15162,I,He pray'd it from his heart.
15163,I,

15165,II,
15166,II,The Abbot of Inisfalen
15167,II,Arose upon his feet;
15168,II,"He heard a small bird singing,"
15169,II,"And, oh, but it sung sweet!"
15170,II,
15171,II,He heard a white bird singing well
15172,II,Within a holly-tree;
15173,II,A song so sweet and happy
15174,II,Never before heard he.
15175,II,
15176,II,"It sung upon a hazel,"
15177,II,It sung upon a thorn;
15178,II,He had never heard such music
15179,II,Since the hour that he was born.
15180,II,
15181,II,"It sung upon a sycamore,"
15182,II,It sung upon a briar;
15183,II,To follow the song and hearken
15184,II,This Abbot could never tire.
15185,II,
15186,II,Till at last he well bethought him
15187,II,He might no longer stay;
15188,II,"So he bless'd the little white singing-bird,"
15189,II,And gladly went his way.
15190,II,
15191,III,III
15192,III,
15193,III,"But when he came to his Abbey walls,"
15194,III,He found a wondrous change;
15195,III,"He saw no friendly faces there,"
15196,III,For every face was strange.
15197,III,
15198,III,The strangers spoke unto him;
15199,III,And he heard from all and each
15200,III,"The foreign tone of the Sassenach,"
15201,III,Not wholesome Irish speech.
15202,III,
15203,III,"Then the oldest monk came forward,"
15204,III,In Irish tongue spake he:
15205,III,"""Thou wearest the holy Augustine's dress,"
15206,III,"And who hath given it to thee?"""
15207,III,
15208,III,"""I wear the holy Augustine's dress,"
15209,III,"And Cormac is my name,"
15210,III,The Abbot of this good Abbey
15211,III,By grace of God I am.
15212,III,
15213,III,"""I went forth to pray, at the dawn of day;"
15214,III,"And when my prayers were said,"
15215,III,I hearkened awhile to a little bird
15216,III,"That sung above my head."""
15217,III,
15218,III,"The monks to him made answer,"
15219,III,"""Two hundred years have gone o'er,"
15220,III,"Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate,"
15221,III,And never was heard of more.
15222,III,
15223,III,"""Matthias now is our Abbot,"
15224,III,And twenty have passed away.
15225,III,The stranger is lord of Ireland;
15226,III,"We live in an evil day."""
15227,III,
15228,IV,IV
15229,IV,
15230,IV,"""Now give me absolution;"
15231,IV,"For my time is come,"" said he."
15232,IV,And they gave him absolution
15233,IV,As speedily as might be.
15234,IV,
15235,IV,"Then, close outside the window,"
15236,IV,The sweetest song they heard
15237,IV,That ever yet since the world began
15238,IV,Was uttered by any bird.
15239,IV,
15240,IV,"The monks looked out and saw the bird,"
15241,IV,Its feathers all white and clean;
15242,IV,"And there in a moment, beside it,"
15243,IV,Another white bird was seen.
15244,IV,
15245,IV,"Those two they sung together,"
15246,IV,"Waved their white wings, and fled;"
15247,IV,"Flew aloft, and vanished;"
15248,IV,But the good old man was dead.
15249,IV,
15250,IV,They buried his blessed body
15251,IV,Where lake and greensward meet;
15252,IV,"A carven cross above his head,"
15253,IV,A holly-bush at his feet;
15254,IV,
15255,IV,Where spreads the beautiful water
15256,IV,"To gay or cloudy skies,"
15257,IV,And the purple peaks of Killarney
15258,IV,From ancient woods arise.

15284,WILLIAM ALLINGHAM.,Once over this brook and rail.
15285,WILLIAM ALLINGHAM.,
15286,WILLIAM ALLINGHAM.,Trap! trap! I heard their echoing hoofs

15437,VII,"Smiling first a little smile,"
15438,VII,As if he knew what magic slept
15439,VII,In his quiet pipe the while;
15440,VII,"Then, like a musical adept,"
15441,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
15442,VII,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
15443,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
15444,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe had uttered,"
15445,VII,You heard as if an army muttered;
15446,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
15447,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
15448,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
15449,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"

15501,IX,For council dinners made rare havoc

15548,XII,Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
15549,XII,Never gave the enraptured air)
15550,XII,There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
15551,XII,"Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,"
15552,XII,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,"
15553,XII,"Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,"

15573,XIII,To where the Weser rolled its waters
15574,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
15575,XIII,"However he turned from South to West,"
15576,XIII,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,"

15582,XIII,"When, lo, as they reached the mountain side,"
15583,XIII,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
15584,XIII,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
15585,XIII,"And the Piper advanced, and the children followed,"
15586,XIII,"And when all were in to the very last,"
15587,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
15588,XIII,"Did I say all? No! One was lame,"

15638,XIV,Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
15639,XIV,Was sure for the future to lose his labour.
15640,XIV,Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern

15643,XIV,"They wrote the story on a column,"
15644,XIV,And on the great church-window painted
15645,XIV,"The same, to make the world acquainted"

17174,INTERLEAVES,"been told, like the old nursery tales, from generation to generation,"
17175,INTERLEAVES,"altered, abbreviated, patched, and added to, as they passed from mouth"
17176,INTERLEAVES,"to mouth of poet, high harper, gleeman, wandering minstrel,"
17177,INTERLEAVES,"ballad-monger, and camp-follower. Some of them were repeated by the"
17178,INTERLEAVES,humble stroller who paid for a corner in the chimney-nook by the
17179,INTERLEAVES,practice of his rude art; others were sung by minstrels of the court;
17180,INTERLEAVES,most of them were chanted to a tune which served for a score of similar
17181,INTERLEAVES,"songs, while the verses were frequently interrupted by refrains of one"
17182,INTERLEAVES,"sort or another, as, for instance, in ""Hynde Horn,"" which is sometimes"
17183,INTERLEAVES,printed as follows:
17184,INTERLEAVES,

17189,INTERLEAVES,
17190,INTERLEAVES,"Many of the ballads are gloomy and tragic stories, but told simply and"
17191,INTERLEAVES,with right feeling; others are gay tales of true love ending happily.
17192,INTERLEAVES,"Some, like ""Sir Patrick Spens"" and ""Chevy Chace,"" are built upon"
17193,INTERLEAVES,"historical foundations, and others, while not following history, have a"
17194,INTERLEAVES,"real personage for hero or heroine. Lord Beichan, for instance, is"
17195,INTERLEAVES,"supposed to be Gilbert Becket, father of the famous Saint Thomas of"
17196,INTERLEAVES,"Canterbury, while Glenlogie is Sir George, one of the ""gay Gordons,"" but"
17197,INTERLEAVES,"whoever they are, wise abbots, jolly friars, or noble outlaws, they are"

18163,OLD BALLAD.,
18164,OLD BALLAD.,The gallant greyhounds swiftly ran
18165,OLD BALLAD.,To chase the fallow deer;
18166,OLD BALLAD.,On Monday they began to hunt
18167,OLD BALLAD.,Ere daylight did appear;
18168,OLD BALLAD.,
18169,OLD BALLAD.,And long before high noon they had
18170,OLD BALLAD.,A hundred fat bucks slain;
18171,OLD BALLAD.,"Then having dined, the drovers went"
18172,OLD BALLAD.,To rouse the deer again.
18173,OLD BALLAD.,
18174,OLD BALLAD.,"The bowmen mustered on the hills,"
18175,OLD BALLAD.,Well able to endure;
18176,OLD BALLAD.,"And all their rear, with special care,"
18177,OLD BALLAD.,That day was guarded sure.
18178,OLD BALLAD.,
18179,OLD BALLAD.,"The hounds ran swiftly through the woods,"
18180,OLD BALLAD.,"The nimble deer to take,"
18181,OLD BALLAD.,That with their cries the hills and dales
18182,OLD BALLAD.,An echo shrill did make.
18183,OLD BALLAD.,
18184,OLD BALLAD.,"Lord Percy to the quarry went,"
18185,OLD BALLAD.,To view the slaughtered deer;
18186,OLD BALLAD.,"Quoth he, ""Earl Douglas promisèd"
18187,OLD BALLAD.,This day to meet me here;
18188,OLD BALLAD.,
18189,OLD BALLAD.,"""But if I thought he would not come,"
18190,OLD BALLAD.,"No longer would I stay;"""
18191,OLD BALLAD.,With that a brave young gentleman
18192,OLD BALLAD.,Thus to the Earl did say:
18193,OLD BALLAD.,
18194,OLD BALLAD.,"""Lo, yonder doth Earl Douglas come,"
18195,OLD BALLAD.,His men in armor bright;
18196,OLD BALLAD.,Full twenty hundred Scottish spears
18197,OLD BALLAD.,All marching in our sight;
18198,OLD BALLAD.,
18199,OLD BALLAD.,"""All men of pleasant Teviotdale,"
18200,OLD BALLAD.,"Fast by the river Tweed;"""
18201,OLD BALLAD.,"""Then cease your sports,"" Earl Percy said,"
18202,OLD BALLAD.,"""And take your bows with speed;"
18203,OLD BALLAD.,
18204,OLD BALLAD.,"""And now with me, my countrymen,"
18205,OLD BALLAD.,Your courage forth advance;
18206,OLD BALLAD.,"For never was there champion yet,"
18207,OLD BALLAD.,"In Scotland or in France,"
18208,OLD BALLAD.,
18209,OLD BALLAD.,"""That ever did on horseback come,"
18210,OLD BALLAD.,"But if my hap it were,"
18211,OLD BALLAD.,"I durst encounter man for man,"
18212,OLD BALLAD.,"With him to break a spear."""
18213,OLD BALLAD.,
18214,OLD BALLAD.,"Earl Douglas on his milk-white steed,"
18215,OLD BALLAD.,"Most like a baron bold,"
18216,OLD BALLAD.,"Rode foremost of his company,"
18217,OLD BALLAD.,Whose armor shone like gold.
18218,OLD BALLAD.,
18219,OLD BALLAD.,"""Show me,"" said he, ""whose men you be,"
18220,OLD BALLAD.,"That hunt so boldly here,"
18221,OLD BALLAD.,"That, without my consent, do chase"
18222,OLD BALLAD.,"And kill my fallow-deer."""
18223,OLD BALLAD.,
18224,OLD BALLAD.,"The first man that did answer make,"
18225,OLD BALLAD.,Was noble Percy he--
18226,OLD BALLAD.,"Who said, ""We list not to declare,"
18227,OLD BALLAD.,Nor show whose men we be:
18228,OLD BALLAD.,
18229,OLD BALLAD.,"""Yet will we spend our dearest blood"
18230,OLD BALLAD.,"Thy chiefest harts to slay."""
18231,OLD BALLAD.,"Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,"
18232,OLD BALLAD.,And thus in rage did say:
18233,OLD BALLAD.,
18234,OLD BALLAD.,"""Ere thus I will out-bravèd be,"
18235,OLD BALLAD.,One of us two shall die;
18236,OLD BALLAD.,"I know thee well, an earl thou art--"
18237,OLD BALLAD.,"Lord Percy, so am I."
18238,OLD BALLAD.,
18239,OLD BALLAD.,"""But trust me, Percy, pity it were,"
18240,OLD BALLAD.,"And great offence, to kill"
18241,OLD BALLAD.,"Any of these our guiltless men,"
18242,OLD BALLAD.,For they have done no ill.
18243,OLD BALLAD.,
18244,OLD BALLAD.,"""Let thou and I the battle try,"
18245,OLD BALLAD.,"And set our men aside."""
18246,OLD BALLAD.,"""Accursed be he,"" Earl Percy said,"
18247,OLD BALLAD.,"""By whom this is denied."""
18248,OLD BALLAD.,
18249,OLD BALLAD.,"Then stepped a gallant squire forth,"
18250,OLD BALLAD.,"Witherington was his name,"
18251,OLD BALLAD.,"Who said, ""I would not have it told"
18252,OLD BALLAD.,"To Henry, our king, for shame,"
18253,OLD BALLAD.,
18254,OLD BALLAD.,"""That e'er my captain fought on foot,"
18255,OLD BALLAD.,And I stood looking on.
18256,OLD BALLAD.,"You two be earls,"" said Witherington,"
18257,OLD BALLAD.,"""And I a squire alone;"
18258,OLD BALLAD.,
18259,OLD BALLAD.,"""I'll do the best that do I may,"
18260,OLD BALLAD.,While I have power to stand;
18261,OLD BALLAD.,"While I have power to wield my sword,"
18262,OLD BALLAD.,"I'll fight with heart and hand."""
18263,OLD BALLAD.,
18264,OLD BALLAD.,Our English archers bent their bows--
18265,OLD BALLAD.,Their hearts were good and true;
18266,OLD BALLAD.,"At the first flight of arrows sent,"
18267,OLD BALLAD.,Full fourscore Scots they slew.
18268,OLD BALLAD.,
18269,OLD BALLAD.,"Yet stays Earl Douglas on the bent,"
18270,OLD BALLAD.,As Chieftain stout and good;
18271,OLD BALLAD.,"As valiant Captain, all unmoved,"
18272,OLD BALLAD.,The shock he firmly stood.
18273,OLD BALLAD.,
18274,OLD BALLAD.,"His host he parted had in three,"
18275,OLD BALLAD.,As leader ware and tried;
18276,OLD BALLAD.,And soon his spearmen on their foes
18277,OLD BALLAD.,Bore down on every side.
18278,OLD BALLAD.,
18279,OLD BALLAD.,Throughout the English archery
18280,OLD BALLAD.,They dealt full many a wound;
18281,OLD BALLAD.,But still our valiant Englishmen
18282,OLD BALLAD.,All firmly kept their ground.
18283,OLD BALLAD.,
18284,OLD BALLAD.,"And throwing straight their bows away,"
18285,OLD BALLAD.,They grasped their swords so bright;
18286,OLD BALLAD.,"And now sharp blows, a heavy shower,"
18287,OLD BALLAD.,On shields and helmets light.
18288,OLD BALLAD.,
18289,OLD BALLAD.,They closed full fast on every side--
18290,OLD BALLAD.,No slackness there was found;
18291,OLD BALLAD.,And many a gallant gentleman
18292,OLD BALLAD.,Lay gasping on the ground.
18293,OLD BALLAD.,
18294,OLD BALLAD.,"In truth, it was a grief to see"
18295,OLD BALLAD.,"How each one chose his spear,"
18296,OLD BALLAD.,And how the blood out of their breasts
18297,OLD BALLAD.,Did gush like water clear.
18298,OLD BALLAD.,
18299,OLD BALLAD.,At last these two stout earls did meet;
18300,OLD BALLAD.,"Like captains of great might,"
18301,OLD BALLAD.,"Like lions wode, they laid on lode,"
18302,OLD BALLAD.,And made a cruel fight.
18303,OLD BALLAD.,
18304,OLD BALLAD.,"They fought until they both did sweat,"
18305,OLD BALLAD.,"With swords of tempered steel,"
18306,OLD BALLAD.,"Until the blood, like drops of rain,"
18307,OLD BALLAD.,They trickling down did feel.
18308,OLD BALLAD.,
18309,OLD BALLAD.,"""Yield thee, Lord Percy,"" Douglas said;"
18310,OLD BALLAD.,"""In faith I will thee bring"
18311,OLD BALLAD.,Where thou shalt high advancèd be
18312,OLD BALLAD.,"By James, our Scottish king."
18313,OLD BALLAD.,
18314,OLD BALLAD.,"""Thy ransom I will freely give,"
18315,OLD BALLAD.,"And this report of thee,"
18316,OLD BALLAD.,Thou art the most courageous knight
18317,OLD BALLAD.,"That ever I did see."""
18318,OLD BALLAD.,
18319,OLD BALLAD.,"""No, Douglas,"" saith Earl Percy then,"
18320,OLD BALLAD.,"""Thy proffer I do scorn;"
18321,OLD BALLAD.,I will not yield to any Scot
18322,OLD BALLAD.,"That ever yet was born."""
18323,OLD BALLAD.,
18324,OLD BALLAD.,With that there came an arrow keen
18325,OLD BALLAD.,"Out of an English bow,"
18326,OLD BALLAD.,"Which struck Earl Douglas to the heart,"
18327,OLD BALLAD.,A deep and deadly blow;
18328,OLD BALLAD.,
18329,OLD BALLAD.,Who never spake more words than these:
18330,OLD BALLAD.,"""Fight on, my merry men all;"
18331,OLD BALLAD.,"For why, my life is at an end;"
18332,OLD BALLAD.,"Lord Percy sees my fall."""
18333,OLD BALLAD.,
18334,OLD BALLAD.,"Then leaving life, Earl Percy took"
18335,OLD BALLAD.,The dead man by the hand;
18336,OLD BALLAD.,"And said, ""Earl Douglas, for thy life"
18337,OLD BALLAD.,Would I had lost my land!
18338,OLD BALLAD.,
18339,OLD BALLAD.,"""In truth, my very heart doth bleed"
18340,OLD BALLAD.,With sorrow for thy sake;
18341,OLD BALLAD.,For sure a more redoubted knight
18342,OLD BALLAD.,"Mischance did never take."""
18343,OLD BALLAD.,
18344,OLD BALLAD.,A knight amongst the Scots there was
18345,OLD BALLAD.,"Who saw Earl Douglas die,"
18346,OLD BALLAD.,Who straight in wrath did vow revenge
18347,OLD BALLAD.,Upon the Earl Percy.
18348,OLD BALLAD.,
18349,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir Hugh Montgomery was he called,"
18350,OLD BALLAD.,"Who, with a spear full bright,"
18351,OLD BALLAD.,"Well mounted on a gallant steed,"
18352,OLD BALLAD.,Ran fiercely through the fight;
18353,OLD BALLAD.,
18354,OLD BALLAD.,"And past the English archers all,"
18355,OLD BALLAD.,Without a dread or fear;
18356,OLD BALLAD.,And through Earl Percy's body then
18357,OLD BALLAD.,He thrust his hateful spear;
18358,OLD BALLAD.,
18359,OLD BALLAD.,With such vehement force and might
18360,OLD BALLAD.,"He did his body gore,"
18361,OLD BALLAD.,The staff ran through the other side
18362,OLD BALLAD.,A large cloth-yard and more.
18363,OLD BALLAD.,
18364,OLD BALLAD.,"So thus did both these nobles die,"
18365,OLD BALLAD.,Whose courage none could stain.
18366,OLD BALLAD.,An English archer then perceived
18367,OLD BALLAD.,The noble Earl was slain.
18368,OLD BALLAD.,
18369,OLD BALLAD.,"He had a bow bent in his hand,"
18370,OLD BALLAD.,Made of a trusty tree;
18371,OLD BALLAD.,An arrow of a cloth-yard long
18372,OLD BALLAD.,To the hard head haled he.
18373,OLD BALLAD.,
18374,OLD BALLAD.,Against Sir Hugh Montgomery
18375,OLD BALLAD.,"So right the shaft he set,"
18376,OLD BALLAD.,The gray goose wing that was thereon
18377,OLD BALLAD.,In his heart's blood was wet.
18378,OLD BALLAD.,
18379,OLD BALLAD.,This fight did last from break of day
18380,OLD BALLAD.,Till setting of the sun:
18381,OLD BALLAD.,"For when they rung the evening-bell,"
18382,OLD BALLAD.,The battle scarce was done.
18383,OLD BALLAD.,
18384,OLD BALLAD.,With stout Earl Percy there was slain
18385,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir John of Egerton,"
18386,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,"
18387,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir James, that bold baròn."
18388,OLD BALLAD.,
18389,OLD BALLAD.,"And with Sir George and stout Sir James,"
18390,OLD BALLAD.,"Both knights of good account,"
18391,OLD BALLAD.,"Good Sir Ralph Raby there was slain,"
18392,OLD BALLAD.,Whose prowess did surmount.
18393,OLD BALLAD.,
18394,OLD BALLAD.,For Witherington needs must I wail
18395,OLD BALLAD.,As one in doleful dumps;
18396,OLD BALLAD.,"For when his legs were smitten off,"
18397,OLD BALLAD.,He fought upon his stumps.
18398,OLD BALLAD.,
18399,OLD BALLAD.,And with Earl Douglas there was slain
18400,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir Hugh Montgomery,"
18401,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir Charles Murray, that from the field,"
18402,OLD BALLAD.,One foot would never flee.
18403,OLD BALLAD.,
18404,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir Charles Murray of Ratcliff, too--"
18405,OLD BALLAD.,His sister's son was he;
18406,OLD BALLAD.,"Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,"
18407,OLD BALLAD.,But saved he could not be.
18408,OLD BALLAD.,
18409,OLD BALLAD.,And the Lord Maxwell in like case
18410,OLD BALLAD.,Did with Earl Douglas die:
18411,OLD BALLAD.,"Of twenty hundred Scottish spears,"
18412,OLD BALLAD.,Scarce fifty-five did fly.
18413,OLD BALLAD.,
18414,OLD BALLAD.,"Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,"
18415,OLD BALLAD.,Went home but fifty-three;
18416,OLD BALLAD.,"The rest on Chevy-Chace were slain,"
18417,OLD BALLAD.,Under the greenwood tree.
18418,OLD BALLAD.,
18419,OLD BALLAD.,"Next day did many widows come,"
18420,OLD BALLAD.,Their husbands to bewail;
18421,OLD BALLAD.,"They washed their wounds in brinish tears,"
18422,OLD BALLAD.,But all would not prevail.
18423,OLD BALLAD.,
18424,OLD BALLAD.,"Their bodies, bathed in purple blood,"
18425,OLD BALLAD.,They bore with them away;
18426,OLD BALLAD.,"They kissed them dead a thousand times,"
18427,OLD BALLAD.,Ere they were clad in clay.
18428,OLD BALLAD.,
18429,OLD BALLAD.,"The news was brought to Edinburgh,"
18430,OLD BALLAD.,"Where Scotland's king did reign,"
18431,OLD BALLAD.,That brave Earl Douglas suddenly
18432,OLD BALLAD.,Was with an arrow slain:
18433,OLD BALLAD.,
18434,OLD BALLAD.,"""Oh heavy news,"" King James did say;"
18435,OLD BALLAD.,"""Scotland can witness be"
18436,OLD BALLAD.,I have not any captain more
18437,OLD BALLAD.,"Of such account as he."""
18438,OLD BALLAD.,
18439,OLD BALLAD.,Like tidings to King Henry came
18440,OLD BALLAD.,"Within as short a space,"
18441,OLD BALLAD.,That Percy of Northumberland
18442,OLD BALLAD.,Was slain in Chevy-Chace:
18443,OLD BALLAD.,
18444,OLD BALLAD.,"""Now God be with him,"" said our king,"
18445,OLD BALLAD.,"""Since 'twill no better be;"
18446,OLD BALLAD.,I trust I have within my realm
18447,OLD BALLAD.,Five hundred as good as he:
18448,OLD BALLAD.,
18449,OLD BALLAD.,"""Yet shall not Scots or Scotland say"
18450,OLD BALLAD.,But I will vengeance take:
18451,OLD BALLAD.,"I'll be revenged on them all,"
18452,OLD BALLAD.,"For brave Earl Percy's sake."""
18453,OLD BALLAD.,
18454,OLD BALLAD.,This vow full well the king performed
18455,OLD BALLAD.,After at Humbledown;
18456,OLD BALLAD.,"In one day fifty knights were slain,"
18457,OLD BALLAD.,With lords of high renown;
18458,OLD BALLAD.,
18459,OLD BALLAD.,"And of the rest, of small account,"
18460,OLD BALLAD.,Did many hundreds die:
18461,OLD BALLAD.,"Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chace,"
18462,OLD BALLAD.,Made by the Earl Percy.
18463,OLD BALLAD.,
18464,OLD BALLAD.,"God save the king, and bless this land,"
18465,OLD BALLAD.,"With plenty, joy and peace;"
18466,OLD BALLAD.,"And grant, henceforth, that foul debate"
18467,OLD BALLAD.,'Twixt noblemen may cease!
18468,OLD BALLAD.,
18469,OLD BALLAD.,OLD BALLAD.
18470,OLD BALLAD.,
18471,OLD BALLAD.,
18472,OLD BALLAD.,_Hynde Horn_
18473,OLD BALLAD.,
18474,OLD BALLAD.,"""Oh, it's Hynde Horn fair, and it's Hynde Horn free;"
18475,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, where were you born, and in what countrie?"""
18476,OLD BALLAD.,"""In a far distant countrie I was born;"
18477,OLD BALLAD.,"But of home and friends I am quite forlorn."""
18478,OLD BALLAD.,
18479,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, it's seven long years he served the king,"
18480,OLD BALLAD.,But wages from him he ne'er got a thing:
18481,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, it's seven long years he served, I ween,"
18482,OLD BALLAD.,And all for love of the king's daughter Jean.
18483,OLD BALLAD.,
18484,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, he gave to his love a silver wand,"
18485,OLD BALLAD.,Her sceptre of rule over fair Scotland;
18486,OLD BALLAD.,"With three singing laverocks set thereon,"
18487,OLD BALLAD.,For to mind her of him when he was gone.
18488,OLD BALLAD.,
18489,OLD BALLAD.,"And his love gave to him a gay gold ring,"
18490,OLD BALLAD.,With three shining diamonds set therein;
18491,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, his love gave to him this gay gold ring,"
18492,OLD BALLAD.,Of virtue and value above all thing;
18493,OLD BALLAD.,"Saying--""While the diamonds do keep their hue,"
18494,OLD BALLAD.,You will know that my love holds fast and true;
18495,OLD BALLAD.,"But when the diamonds grow pale and wan,"
18496,OLD BALLAD.,"I'll be dead, or wed to another man."""
18497,OLD BALLAD.,
18498,OLD BALLAD.,"Then the sails were spread, and away sail'd he;"
18499,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, he sail'd away to a far countrie;"
18500,OLD BALLAD.,"And when he had been seven years to sea,"
18501,OLD BALLAD.,Hynde Horn look'd to see how his ring might be.
18502,OLD BALLAD.,
18503,OLD BALLAD.,"But when Hynde Horn look'd the diamonds upon,"
18504,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, he saw that they were both pale and wan;"
18505,OLD BALLAD.,"And at once he knew, from their alter'd hue,"
18506,OLD BALLAD.,That his love was dead or had proved untrue.
18507,OLD BALLAD.,
18508,OLD BALLAD.,"Oh, the sails were spread, and away sail'd he"
18509,OLD BALLAD.,Back over the sea to his own countrie;
18510,OLD BALLAD.,"Then he left the ship when it came to land,"
18511,OLD BALLAD.,And he met an auld beggar upon the strand.
18512,OLD BALLAD.,
18513,OLD BALLAD.,"""What news, thou auld beggar man?"" said he;"
18514,OLD BALLAD.,"""For full seven years I've been over the sea."""
18515,OLD BALLAD.,"Then the auld man said--""The strangest of all"
18516,OLD BALLAD.,Is the curious wedding in our king's hall.
18517,OLD BALLAD.,
18518,OLD BALLAD.,"""For there's a king's daughter, came frae the wast,"
18519,OLD BALLAD.,Has been married to him these nine days past;
18520,OLD BALLAD.,"But unto him a wife the bride winna be,"
18521,OLD BALLAD.,"For love of Hynde Horn, far over the sea."""
18522,OLD BALLAD.,
18523,OLD BALLAD.,"""Now, auld man, give to me your begging weed,"
18524,OLD BALLAD.,And I will give to thee my riding steed;
18525,OLD BALLAD.,"And, auld man, give to me your staff of tree,"
18526,OLD BALLAD.,And my scarlet cloak I will give to thee.
18527,OLD BALLAD.,
18528,OLD BALLAD.,"""And you must teach me the auld beggar's role,"
18529,OLD BALLAD.,"As he goes his rounds, and receives his dole."""
18530,OLD BALLAD.,"The auld man he did as young Hynde Horn said,"
18531,OLD BALLAD.,And taught him the way to beg for his bread.
18532,OLD BALLAD.,
18533,OLD BALLAD.,"Then Hynde Horn bent him to his staff of tree,"
18534,OLD BALLAD.,And to the king's palace away hobbled he;
18535,OLD BALLAD.,"And when he arrived at the king's palace gate,"
18536,OLD BALLAD.,To the porter he thus his petition did state:
18537,OLD BALLAD.,
18538,OLD BALLAD.,"""Good porter, I pray, for Saints Peter and Paul,"
18539,OLD BALLAD.,"And for sake of the Saviour who died for us all,"
18540,OLD BALLAD.,"For one cup of wine, and one bit of bread,"
18541,OLD BALLAD.,To an auld man with travel and hunger bestead.
18542,OLD BALLAD.,
18543,OLD BALLAD.,"""And ask the fair bride, for the sake of Hynde Horn,"
18544,OLD BALLAD.,"To hand them to one so sadly forlorn."""
18545,OLD BALLAD.,"Then the porter for pity the message convey'd,"
18546,OLD BALLAD.,And told the fair bride all the beggar man said.
18547,OLD BALLAD.,
18548,OLD BALLAD.,"And when she did hear it, she tripp'd down the stair,"
18549,OLD BALLAD.,And in her fair hands did lovingly bear
18550,OLD BALLAD.,"A cup of red wine, and a farle of cake,"
18551,OLD BALLAD.,"To give the old man, for loved Hynde Horn's sake."
18552,OLD BALLAD.,
18553,OLD BALLAD.,"And when she came to where Hynde Horn did stand,"
18554,OLD BALLAD.,With joy he did take the cup from her hand;
18555,OLD BALLAD.,"Then pledged the fair bride, the cup out did drain,"
18556,OLD BALLAD.,"Dropp'd in it the ring, and return'd it again."
18557,OLD BALLAD.,
18558,OLD BALLAD.,"""Oh, found you that ring by sea or on land,"
18559,OLD BALLAD.,"Or got you that ring off a dead man's hand?"""
18560,OLD BALLAD.,"""Oh, I found not that ring by sea or on land,"
18561,OLD BALLAD.,But I got that ring from a fair lady's hand.
18562,OLD BALLAD.,
18563,OLD BALLAD.,"""As a pledge of true love she gave it to me,"
18564,OLD BALLAD.,"Full seven years ago, as I sail'd o'er the sea;"
18565,OLD BALLAD.,"But now that the diamonds are chang'd in their hue,"
18566,OLD BALLAD.,"I know that my love has to me proved untrue."""
18567,OLD BALLAD.,
18568,OLD BALLAD.,"""Oh, I will cast off my gay costly gown,"
18569,OLD BALLAD.,"And follow thee on from town unto town,"
18570,OLD BALLAD.,"And I will take the gold combs from my hair,"
18571,OLD BALLAD.,"And follow my true love for ever mair."""
