105,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
106,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
107,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"THERE was once a little Brownie, who lived--where do you think he lived?"
108,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,in a coal-cellar.
109,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
110,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Now a coal-cellar may seem a most curious place to choose to live in;
111,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"but then a Brownie is a curious creature--a fairy, and yet not one of"
112,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"that sort of fairies who fly about on gossamer wings, and dance in the"
113,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"moonlight, and so on. He never dances; and as to wings, what use would"
114,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"they be to him in a coal-cellar? He is a sober, stay-at-home, household"
115,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"elf--nothing much to look at, even if you did see him, which you are not"
116,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"likely to do--only a little old man, about a foot high, all dressed in"
117,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"brown, with a brown face and hands, and a brown peaked cap, just the"
118,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"color of a brown mouse. And, like a mouse, he hides in corners--especially"
119,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"kitchen corners, and only comes out after dark when nobody is about, and"
120,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,so sometimes people call him Mr. Nobody.
121,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
122,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"I said you were not likely to see him. I never did, certainly, and never"
123,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"knew any body that did; but still, if you were to go into Devonshire,"
124,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"you would hear many funny stories about Brownies in general, and so I"
125,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"may as well tell you the adventures of this particular Brownie, who"
126,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,belonged to a family there; which family he had followed from house to
127,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"house, most faithfully, for years and years."
128,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
129,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,A good many people had heard him--or supposed they had--when there were
130,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,extraordinary noises about the house; noises which must have come from a
131,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,mouse or a rat--or a Brownie. But nobody had ever seen him except the
132,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,children--the three little boys and three little girls--who declared he
133,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"often came to play with them when they were alone, and was the nicest"
134,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"companion in the world, though he was such an old man--hundreds of years"
135,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"old! He was full of fun and mischief, and up to all sorts of tricks, but"
136,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,he never did any body any harm unless they deserved it.
137,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
138,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Brownie was supposed to live under one particular coal, in the darkest"
139,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"corner of the cellar, which was never allowed to be disturbed. Why he"
140,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"had chosen it nobody knew, and how he lived there, nobody knew either,"
141,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"nor what he lived upon. Except that, ever since the family could"
142,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"remember, there had always been a bowl of milk put behind the"
143,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,coal-cellar door for the Brownie's supper. Perhaps he drank it--perhaps
144,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"he didn't: anyhow, the bowl was always found empty next morning. The old"
145,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Cook, who had lived all her life in the family, had never forgotten to"
146,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"give Brownie his supper; but at last she died, and a young cook came in"
147,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"her stead, who was very apt to forget every thing. She was also both"
148,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"careless and lazy, and disliked taking the trouble to put a bowl of milk"
149,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"in the same place every night for Mr. Nobody. ""She didn't believe in"
150,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Brownies,"" she said; ""she had never seen one, and seeing's believing."""
151,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"So she laughed at the other servants, who looked very grave, and put"
152,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"the bowl of milk in its place as often as they could, without saying"
153,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,much about it.
154,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
155,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"But once, when Brownie woke up, at his usual hour for rising--ten"
156,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"o'clock at night, and looked round in search of his supper--which was,"
157,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"in fact, his breakfast--he found nothing there. At first he could not"
158,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"imagine such neglect, and went smelling and smelling about for his bowl"
159,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,of milk--it was not always placed in the same corner now--but in vain.
160,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
161,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""This will never do,"" said he; and being extremely hungry, began running"
162,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,about the coal-cellar to see what he could find. His eyes were as useful
163,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,in the dark as in the light--like a pussy-cat's; but there was nothing
164,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"to be seen--not even a potato paring, or a dry crust, or a well-gnawed"
165,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"bone, such as Tiny the terrier sometimes brought into the coal-cellar"
166,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"and left on the floor--nothing, in short, but heaps of coals and"
167,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"coal-dust; and even a Brownie cannot eat that, you know."
168,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
169,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""Can't stand this; quite impossible!"" said the Brownie, tightening his"
170,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,belt to make his poor little inside feel less empty. He had been asleep
171,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"so long--about a week, I believe, as was his habit when there was"
172,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"nothing to do--that he seemed ready to eat his own head, or his boots,"
173,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"or any thing. 'What's to be done? Since nobody brings my supper, I must"
174,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,go and fetch it.'
175,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
176,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"He spoke quickly, for he always thought quickly, and made up his mind in"
177,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"a minute. To be sure it was a very little mind, like his little body;"
178,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"but he did the best he could with it, and was not a bad sort of old"
179,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"fellow, after all. In the house he had never done any harm, and often"
180,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"some good, for he frightened away all the rats, mice, and black-beetles."
181,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Not the crickets--he liked them, as the old Cook had done: she said"
182,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"they were such cheerful creatures, and always brought luck to the house."
183,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"But the young Cook could not bear them, and used to pour boiling water"
184,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"down their holes, and set basins of beer for them with little wooden"
185,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"bridges up to the brim, that they might walk up, tumble in, and be"
186,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,drowned.
187,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
188,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,So there was not even a cricket singing in the silent house when Brownie
189,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"put his head out of his coal-cellar door, which, to his surprise, he"
190,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"found open. Old Cook used to lock it every night, but the young Cook had"
191,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"left that key, and the kitchen and pantry keys too, all dangling in the"
192,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"lock, so that any thief might have got in, and wandered all over the"
193,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,house without being found out.
194,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
195,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""Hurrah, here's luck!"" cried Brownie, tossing his cap up in the air, and"
196,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,bounding right through the scullery into the kitchen. It was quite
197,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"empty, but there was a good fire burning itself out--just for its own"
198,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"amusement, and the remains of a capital supper spread on the"
199,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,table--enough for half a dozen people being left still.
200,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
201,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Would you like to know what there was? Devonshire cream, of course; and"
202,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"part of a large dish of junket, which is something like curds and whey."
203,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Lots of bread-and-butter and cheese, and half an apple-pudding. Also a"
204,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"great jug of cider and another of milk, and several half-full glasses,"
205,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"and no end of dirty plates, knives, and forks. All were scattered about"
206,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"the table in the most untidy fashion, just as the servants had risen"
207,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"from their supper, without thinking to put any thing away."
208,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
209,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Brownie screwed up his little old face and turned up his button of a
210,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"nose, and gave a long whistle. You might not believe it, seeing he lived"
211,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"in a coal-cellar; but really he liked tidiness, and always played his"
212,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,pranks upon disorderly or slovenly folk.
213,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
214,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"[Illustration: He wanted his supper, and oh! what a supper he did"
215,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,eat!--Page 11]
216,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
217,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""Whew!"" said he; ""here's a chance. What a supper I'll get now!"""
218,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
219,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"And he jumped on to a chair and thence to the table, but so quietly that"
220,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"the large black cat with four white paws, called Muff, because she was"
221,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"so fat and soft and her fur so long, who sat dozing in front of the"
222,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"fire, just opened one eye and went to sleep again. She had tried to get"
223,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"her nose into the milk-jug, but it was too small; and the junket-dish"
224,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"was too deep for her to reach, except with one paw. She didn't care much"
225,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"for bread and cheese and apple-pudding, and was very well fed besides;"
226,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"so, after just wandering round the table, she had jumped down from it"
227,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"again, and settled herself to sleep on the hearth."
228,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
229,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"But Brownie had no notion of going to sleep. He wanted his supper, and"
230,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"oh! what a supper he did eat! first one thing and then another, and then"
231,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,trying every thing all over again. And oh! what a lot he drank--first
232,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"milk and then cider, and then mixed the two together in a way that would"
233,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"have disagreed with any body except a Brownie. As it was, he was obliged"
234,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"to slacken his belt several times, and at last took it off altogether."
235,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,But he must have had a most extraordinary capacity for eating and
236,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"drinking--since, after he had nearly cleared the table, he was just as"
237,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,lively as if he had had no supper at all.
238,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
239,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Now his jumping was a little awkward, for there happened to be a clean"
240,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"white tablecloth: as this was only Monday, it had had no time to get"
241,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,dirty--untidy as the Cook was. And you know Brownie lived in a
242,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"coal-cellar, and his feet were black with running about in coal dust. So"
243,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"wherever he trod, he left the impression behind, until at last the whole"
244,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,tablecloth was covered with black marks.
245,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
246,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Not that he minded this; in fact, he took great pains to make the cloth"
247,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"as dirty as possible; and then laughing loudly, ""Ho, ho, ho!"" leaped on"
248,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"to the hearth, and began teasing the cat; squeaking like a mouse, or"
249,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"chirping like a cricket, or buzzing like a fly; and altogether"
250,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"disturbing poor Pussy's mind so much, that she went and hid herself in"
251,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"the farthest corner, and left him the hearth all to himself, where he"
252,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,lay at ease till daybreak.
253,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
254,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Then, hearing a slight noise overhead, which might be the servants"
255,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"getting up, he jumped on to the table again--gobbled up the few"
256,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"remaining crumbs for his breakfast, and scampered off to his"
257,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"coal-cellar; where he hid himself under his big coal, and fell asleep"
258,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,for the day.
259,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
260,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Well, the Cook came downstairs rather earlier than usual, for she"
261,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,remembered she had to clear off the remains of supper; but lo and
262,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"behold, there was nothing left to clear. Every bit of food was eaten"
263,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"up--the cheese looked as if a dozen mice had been nibbling at it, and"
264,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,nibbled it down to the very rind; the milk and cider were all drunk--and
265,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"mice don't care for milk and cider, you know. As for the apple-pudding,"
266,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,it had vanished altogether; and the dish was licked as clean as if
267,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Boxer, the yard-dog, had been at it in his hungriest mood."
268,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
269,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""And my white table-cloth--oh, my clean white table-cloth! What can have"
270,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"been done to it?"" cried she, in amazement. For it was all over little"
271,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"black footmarks, just the size of a baby's foot--only babies don't wear"
272,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"shoes with nails in them, and don't run about and climb on kitchen"
273,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,tables after all the family have gone to bed.
274,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
275,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Cook was a little frightened; but her fright changed to anger when she
276,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,saw the large black cat stretched comfortably on the hearth. Poor Muff
277,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,had crept there for a little snooze after Brownie went away.
278,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
279,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""You nasty cat! I see it all now; it's you that have eaten up all the"
280,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,supper; it's you that have been on my clean table-cloth with your dirty
281,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"paws."""
282,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
283,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,[Illustration: Cook beat poor Pussy till the creature ran mewing away]
284,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
285,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"They were white paws, and as clean as possible; but the Cook never"
286,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"thought of that, any more than she did of the fact that cats don't"
287,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,usually drink cider or eat apple-pudding.
288,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
289,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""I'll teach you to come stealing food in this way; take that--and"
290,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"that--and that!"""
291,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
292,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Cook got hold of a broom and beat poor Pussy till the creature ran
293,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"mewing away. She couldn't speak, you know--unfortunate cat! and tell"
294,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,people that it was Brownie who had done it all.
295,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
296,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Next night Cook thought she would make all safe and sure; so, instead of"
297,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"letting the cat sleep by the fire, she shut her up in the chilly"
298,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"coal-cellar, locked the door, put the key in her pocket, and went off to"
299,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,bed--leaving the supper as before.
300,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
301,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"When Brownie woke up and looked out of his hole, there was, as usual, no"
302,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"supper for him, and the cellar was close shut. He peered about, to try"
303,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"and find some cranny under the door to creep out at, but there was none."
304,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"And he felt so hungry that he could almost have eaten the cat, who kept"
305,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"walking to and fro in a melancholy manner--only she was alive, and he"
306,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"couldn't well eat her alive: besides, he knew she was old, and had an"
307,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"idea she might be tough; so he merely said, politely, ""How do you do,"
308,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Mrs. Pussy?"" to which she answered nothing--of course."
309,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
310,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Something must be done, and luckily Brownies can do things which nobody"
311,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"else can do. So he thought he would change himself into a mouse, and"
312,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"gnaw a hole through the door. But then he suddenly remembered the cat,"
313,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"who, though he had decided not to eat her, might take this opportunity"
314,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,of eating him. So he thought it advisable to wait till she was fast
315,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"asleep, which did not happen for a good while. At length, quite tired"
316,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"with walking about, Pussy turned round on her tail six times, curled"
317,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"down in a corner, and fell fast asleep."
318,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
319,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Immediately Brownie changed himself into the smallest mouse possible;
320,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"and, taking care not to make the least noise, gnawed a hole in the door,"
321,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"and squeezed himself through, immediately turning into his proper shape"
322,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"again, for fear of accidents."
323,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
324,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,The kitchen fire was at its last glimmer; but it showed a better supper
325,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"than even last night, for the Cook had had friends with her--a brother"
326,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,and two cousins--and they had been exceedingly merry. The food they had
327,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"left behind was enough for three Brownies at least, but this one managed"
328,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"to eat it all up. Only once, in trying to cut a great slice of beef, he"
329,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"let the carving-knife and fork fall with such a clatter, that Tiny the"
330,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"terrier, who was tied up at the foot of the stairs, began to bark"
331,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"furiously. However, he brought her her puppy, which had been left in a"
332,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"basket in a corner of the kitchen, and so succeeded in quieting her."
333,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
334,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"After that he enjoyed himself amazingly, and made more marks than ever"
335,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,on the white table-cloth; for he began jumping about like a pea on a
336,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"trencher, in order to make his particularly large supper agree with him."
337,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
338,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Then, in the absence of the cat, he teased the puppy for an hour or two,"
339,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"till hearing the clock strike five, he thought it as well to turn into a"
340,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"mouse again, and creep back cautiously into his cellar. He was only just"
341,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"in time, for Muff opened one eye, and was just going to pounce upon him,"
342,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,when he changed himself back into a Brownie. She was so startled that
343,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"she bounded away, her tail growing into twice its natural size, and her"
344,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"eyes gleaming like round green globes. But Brownie only said, ""Ha, ha,"
345,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"ho!"" and walked deliberately into his hole."
346,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
347,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,When Cook came downstairs and saw that the same thing had happened
348,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"again--that the supper was all eaten, and the table-cloth blacker than"
349,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"ever with the extraordinary footmarks, she was greatly puzzled. Who"
350,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"could have done it all? Not the cat, who came mewing out of the"
351,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,coal-cellar the minute she unlocked the door. Possibly a rat--but then
352,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,would a rat have come within reach of Tiny?
353,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
354,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""It must have been Tiny herself, or her puppy,"" which just came rolling"
355,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"out of its basket over Cook's feet. ""You little wretch! You and your"
356,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"mother are the greatest nuisance imaginable. I'll punish you!"""
357,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
358,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"And, quite forgetting that Tiny had been safely tied up all night, and"
359,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,that her poor little puppy was so fat and helpless it could scarcely
360,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"stand on its legs, to say nothing of jumping on chairs and tables, she"
361,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,gave them both such a thrashing that they ran howling together out of
362,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"the kitchen door, where the kind little kitchen-maid took them up in her"
363,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,arms.
364,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
365,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""You ought to have beaten the Brownie, if you could catch him,"" said"
366,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"she, in a whisper. ""He will do it again and again, you'll see, for he"
367,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"can't bear an untidy kitchen. You'd better do as poor old Cook did, and"
368,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"clear the supper things away, and put the odds and ends safe in the"
369,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"larder; also,"" she added, mysteriously, ""if I were you, I'd put a bowl"
370,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"of milk behind the coal-cellar door."""
371,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
372,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"""Nonsense!"" answered the young Cook, and flounced away. But afterward"
373,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"she thought better of it, and did as she was advised, grumbling all the"
374,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"time, but doing it."
375,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,
376,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"Next morning the milk was gone! Perhaps Brownie had drunk it up, anyhow"
377,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"nobody could say that he hadn't. As for the supper, Cook having safely"
378,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"laid it on the shelves of the larder, nobody touched it. And the"
379,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"table-cloth, which was wrapped up tidily and put in the dresser drawer,"
380,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"came out as clean as ever, with not a single black footmark upon it. No"
381,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,"mischief being done, the cat and the dog both escaped beating, and"
382,BROWNIE AND THE COOK,Brownie played no more tricks with any body--till the next time.

395,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
396,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"THE ""next time"" was quick in coming, which was not wonderful,"
397,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,considering there was a Brownie in the house. Otherwise the house was
398,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"like most other houses, and the family like most other families. The"
399,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"children also: they were sometimes good, sometimes naughty, like other"
400,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"children; but, on the whole, they deserved to have the pleasure of a"
401,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Brownie to play with them, as they declared he did--many and many a"
402,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,time.
403,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
404,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"A favorite play-place was the orchard, where grew the biggest"
405,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"cherry-tree you ever saw. They called it their ""castle,"" because it rose"
406,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"up ten feet from the ground in one thick stem, and then branched out"
407,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"into a circle of boughs, with a flat place in the middle, where two or"
408,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"three children could sit at once. There they often did sit, turn by"
409,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"turn, or one at a time--sometimes with a book, reading; and the biggest"
410,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,boy made a sort of rope-ladder by which they could climb up and
411,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"down--which they did all winter, and enjoyed their ""castle"" very much."
412,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
413,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,But one day in spring they found their ladder cut away! The Gardener
414,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"had done it, saying it injured the tree, which was just coming into"
415,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"blossom. Now this Gardener was a rather gruff man, with a growling"
416,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"voice. He did not mean to be unkind, but he disliked children; he said"
417,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,they bothered him. But when they complained to their mother about the
418,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"ladder, she agreed with Gardener that the tree must not be injured, as"
419,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,it bore the biggest cherries in all the neighborhood--so big that the
420,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"old saying of ""taking two bites at a cherry,"" came really true."
421,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
422,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Wait till the cherries are ripe,"" said she; and so the little people"
423,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"waited, and watched it through its leafing and blossoming--such sheets"
424,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"of blossom, white as snow!--till the fruit began to show, and grew large"
425,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,and red on every bough.
426,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
427,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"At last one morning the mother said, ""Children, should you like to help"
428,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"gather the cherries to-day?"""
429,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
430,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Hurrah!"" they cried, ""and not a day too soon; for we saw a flock of"
431,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"starlings in the next field--and if we don't clear the tree, they will."""
432,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
433,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Very well; clear it, then. Only mind and fill my basket quite full, for"
434,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"preserving. What is over you may eat, if you like."""
435,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
436,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Thank you, thank you!"" and the children were eager to be off; but the"
437,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,mother stopped them till she could get the Gardener and his ladder.
438,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
439,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""For it is he must climb the tree, not you; and you must do exactly as"
440,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,he tells you; and he will stop with you all the time and see that you
441,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"don't come to harm."""
442,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
443,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"This was no slight cloud on the children's happiness, and they begged"
444,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,hard to go alone.
445,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
446,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Please, might we? We will be so good!"""
447,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
448,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,[Illustration: When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the
449,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,trunk of the cherry-tree]
450,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
451,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,The mother shook her head. All the goodness in the world would not help
452,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"them if they tumbled off the tree, or ate themselves sick with cherries."
453,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""You would not be safe, and I should be so unhappy!"""
454,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
455,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"To make mother ""unhappy"" was the worst rebuke possible to these"
456,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"children; so they choked down their disappointment, and followed the"
457,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Gardener as he walked on ahead, carrying his ladder on his shoulder. He"
458,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"looked very cross, and as if he did not like the children's company at"
459,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,all.
460,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
461,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"They were pretty good, on the whole, though they chattered a good deal;"
462,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,but Gardener said not a word to them all the way to the orchard. When
463,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"they reached it, he just told them to ""keep out of his way and not"
464,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"worrit him,"" which they politely promised, saying among themselves that"
465,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,they should not enjoy their cherry-gathering at all. But children who
466,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"make the best of things, and try to be as good as they can, sometimes"
467,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,have fun unawares.
468,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
469,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,When the Gardener was steadying his ladder against the trunk of the
470,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"cherry-tree, there was suddenly heard the barking of a dog, and a very"
471,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"fierce dog, too. First it seemed close beside them, then in the"
472,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"flower-garden, then in the fowl-yard."
473,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
474,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Gardener dropped the ladder out of his hands. ""It's that Boxer! He has"
475,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"got loose again! He will be running after my chickens, and dragging his"
476,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"broken chain all over my borders. And he is so fierce, and so delighted"
477,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"to get free. He'll bite any body who ties him up, except me."""
478,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
479,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Hadn't you better you go and see after him?"""
480,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
481,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Gardener thought it was the eldest boy who spoke, and turned round"
482,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,angrily; but the little fellow had never opened his lips.
483,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
484,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Here there was heard a still louder bark, and from a quite different"
485,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,part of the garden.
486,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
487,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""There he is--I'm sure of it! jumping over my bedding-out plants, and"
488,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"breaking my cucumber frames. Abominable beast!--just let me catch him!"""
489,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Off Gardener darted in a violent passion, throwing the ladder down upon"
490,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"the grass, and forgetting all about the cherries and the children."
491,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
492,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"The instant he was gone, a shrill laugh, loud and merry, was heard close"
493,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"by, and a little brown old man's face peeped from behind the"
494,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,cherry-tree.
495,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
496,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""How d'ye do?--Boxer was me. Didn't I bark well? Now I'm come to play"
497,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"with you."""
498,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
499,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,The children clapped their hands; for they knew they were going to have
500,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,some fun if Brownie was there--he was the best little playfellow in the
501,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,world. And then they had him all to themselves. Nobody ever saw him
502,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,except the children.
503,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
504,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Come on!"" cried he, in his shrill voice, half like an old man's, half"
505,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"like a baby's. ""Who'll begin to gather the cherries?"""
506,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
507,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,[Illustration: A little brown old man's face peeped from behind the
508,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,cherry-tree.--Page 20]
509,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
510,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,They all looked blank; for the tree was so high to where the branches
511,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"sprang, and besides, their mother had said they were not to climb. And"
512,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,the ladder lay flat upon the grass--far too heavy for little hands to
513,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,move.
514,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
515,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""What! you big boys don't expect a poor little fellow like me to lift"
516,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"the ladder all by myself? Try! I'll help you."""
517,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
518,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"Whether he helped or not, no sooner had they taken hold of the ladder"
519,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"than it rose up, almost of its own accord, and fixed itself quite safely"
520,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,against the tree.
521,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
522,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""But we must not climb--mother told us not,"" said the boys, ruefully."
523,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Mother said we were to stand at the bottom and pick up the cherries."""
524,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
525,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Very well. Obey your mother. I'll just run up the tree myself."""
526,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
527,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,Before the words were out of his mouth Brownie darted up the ladder like
528,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"a monkey, and disappeared among the fruit-laden branches."
529,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
530,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"The children looked dismayed for a minute, till they saw a merry brown"
531,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,face peeping out from the green leaves at the very top of the tree.
532,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
533,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Biggest fruit always grows highest,"" cried the Brownie. ""Stand in a"
534,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"row, all you children. Little boys, hold out your caps: little girls,"
535,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"make a bag of your pinafores. Open your mouths and shut your eyes, and"
536,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"see what the queen will send you."""
537,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
538,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,They laughed and did as they were told; whereupon they were drowned in a
539,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"shower of cherries--cherries falling like hailstones, hitting them on"
540,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"their heads, their cheeks, their noses--filling their caps and"
541,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"pinafores, and then rolling and tumbling on to the grass, till it was"
542,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,strewn thick as leaves in autumn with the rosy fruit.
543,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
544,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,What a glorious scramble they had--these three little boys and three
545,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,little girls! How they laughed and jumped and knocked their heads
546,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"together in picking up the cherries, yet never quarreled--for there were"
547,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"such heaps, it would have been ridiculous to squabble over them; and"
548,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"besides, whenever they began to quarrel, Brownie always ran away. Now he"
549,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"was the merriest of the lot; ran up and down the tree like a cat, helped"
550,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"to pick up the cherries, and was first-rate at filling the large"
551,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,market-basket.
552,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
553,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""We were to eat as many as we liked, only we must first fill the"
554,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"basket,"" conscientiously said the eldest girl; upon which they all set"
555,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"to at once, and filled it to the brim."
556,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
557,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Now we'll have a dinner-party,"" cried the Brownie; and squatted down"
558,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"like a Turk, crossed his queer little legs, and sticking his elbows upon"
559,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"his knees, in a way that nobody but a Brownie could manage. ""Sit in a"
560,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"ring! sit in a ring! and we'll see who can eat fastest."""
561,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
562,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"The children obeyed. How many cherries they devoured, and how fast they"
563,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"did it, passes my capacity of telling. I only hope they were not ill"
564,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"next day, and that all the cherry-stones they swallowed by mistake did"
565,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,not disagree with them. But perhaps nothing does disagree with one when
566,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"one dines with a Brownie. They ate so much, laughing in equal"
567,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"proportion, that they had quite forgotten the Gardener--when, all of a"
568,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"sudden, they heard him clicking angrily the orchard gate, and talking to"
569,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,himself as he walked through.
570,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
571,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""That nasty dog! It wasn't Boxer, after all. A nice joke! to find him"
572,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"quietly asleep in his kennel after having hunted him, as I thought, from"
573,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,one end of the garden to the other! Now for the cherries and the
574,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"children--bless us, where are the children? And the cherries? Why, the"
575,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,tree is as bare as a blackthorn in February! The starlings have been at
576,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"it, after all. Oh dear! oh dear!"""
577,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
578,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""Oh dear! oh dear!"" echoed a voice from behind the tree, followed by"
579,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,shouts of mocking laughter. Not from the children--they sat as demure as
580,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"possible, all in a ring, with their hands before them, and in the centre"
581,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"the huge basket of cherries, piled as full as it could possibly hold."
582,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,But the Brownie had disappeared.
583,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
584,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"""You naughty brats, I'll have you punished!"" cried the Gardener, furious"
585,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"at the laughter, for he never laughed himself. But as there was nothing"
586,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,wrong; the cherries being gathered--a very large crop--and the ladder
587,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,found safe in its place--it was difficult to say what had been the harm
588,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,done and who had done it.
589,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,
590,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"So he went growling back to the house, carrying the cherries to the"
591,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"mistress, who coaxed him into good temper again, as she sometimes did;"
592,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"bidding also the children to behave well to him, since he was an old"
593,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"man, and not really bad--only cross. As for the little folks, she had"
594,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,"not the slightest intention of punishing them; and, as for Brownie, it"
595,BROWNIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE,was impossible to catch him. So nobody was punished at all.

611,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"wander anywhere, in order to play tricks upon those whom he thought had"

624,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
625,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Then you'd better hold your tongue, and mind your own business,"""
626,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"returned the Cook, who was of a sharp temper, and would not stand being"

651,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"are a deal better. You'll find out your mistake some day."""
652,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
653,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""And so will you when that old Alderney runs dry. You'll wish you had"
654,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"taken my advice, and fattened and sold her."""
655,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
656,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Alderney cows won't sell for fattening, and women's advice is never"
657,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,worth twopence. Yours isn't worth even a half-penny. What are you
658,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"laughing at?"""
659,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
660,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""I wasn't laughing,"" said the wife, angrily; and, in truth, it was not"
661,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"she, but little Brownie, running under the barrow which the Gardener was"
662,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"wheeling along, and very much amused that people should be so silly as"
663,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,to squabble about nothing.
664,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
665,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"It was still early morning; for, whatever this old couple's faults might"
666,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"be, laziness was not one of them. The wife rose with the dawn to feed"
667,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,her poultry and collect her eggs; the husband also got through as much
668,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,work by breakfast-time as many an idle man does by noon. But Brownie had
669,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,been beforehand with them this day.
670,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
671,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"When all the fowls came running to be fed, the big Brahma hen who had"
672,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"watched the ducklings was seen wandering forlornly about, and clucking"
673,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,mournfully for her young brood--she could not find them anywhere. Had
674,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"she been able to speak, she might have told how a large white Aylesbury"
675,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"duck had waddled into the farmyard, and waddled out again, coaxing them"
676,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"after her, no doubt in search of a pond. But missing they were, most"
677,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,certainly.
678,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
679,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Cluck, cluck, cluck!"" mourned the miserable hen-mother--and, ""Oh, my"
680,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"ducklings, my ducklings!"" cried the Gardener's wife--""Who can have"
681,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"carried off my beautiful ducklings?"""
682,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
683,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Rats, maybe,"" said the Gardener, cruelly, as he walked away. And as he"
684,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,went he heard the squeak of a rat below his wheelbarrow. But he could
685,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"not catch it, any more than his wife could catch the Aylesbury duck. Of"
686,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,course not. Both were--the Brownie!
687,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
688,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Just at this moment the six little people came running into the
689,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"farmyard. When they had been particularly good, they were sometimes"
690,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"allowed to go with Gardener a-milking, each carrying his or her own mug"
691,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"for a drink of milk, warm from the cow. They scampered after him--a"
692,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"noisy tribe, begging to be taken down to the field, and holding out"
693,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,their six mugs entreatingly.
694,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
695,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""What! six cupfuls of milk, when I haven't a drop to spare, and Cook is"
696,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,always wanting more? Ridiculous nonsense! Get along with you; you may
697,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,come to the field--I can't hinder that--but you'll get no milk to-day.
698,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Take your mugs back again to the kitchen."""
699,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
700,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"[Illustration: A noisy tribe, holding out their six mugs entreatingly.]"
701,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
702,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"The poor little folks made the best of a bad business, and obeyed; then"
703,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"followed Gardener down to the field, rather dolefully. But it was such a"
704,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,beautiful morning that they soon recovered their spirits. The grass
705,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"shone with dew, like a sheet of diamonds, the clover smelled so sweet,"
706,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,and two skylarks were singing at one another high up in the sky. Several
707,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"rabbits darted past, to their great amusement, especially one very large"
708,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"rabbit--brown, not gray--which dodged them in and out, and once nearly"
709,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"threw Gardener down, pail and all, by running across his feet; which set"
710,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"them all laughing, till they came where Dolly, the cow, lay chewing the"
711,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,cud under a large oak-tree.
712,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
713,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"It was great fun to stir her up, as usual, and lie down, one after the"
714,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"other, in the place where she had lain all night long, making the grass"
715,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"flat, and warm, and perfumy with her sweet breath. She let them do it,"
716,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,and then stood meekly by; for Dolly was the gentlest cow in the world.
717,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
718,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,But this morning something strange seemed to possess her. She altogether
719,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"refused to be milked--kicked, plunged, tossed over the pail, which was"
720,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,luckily empty.
721,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
722,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Bless the cow! what's wrong with her? It's surely you children's fault."
723,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Stand off, the whole lot of you. Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!"""
724,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
725,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"But Dolly was any thing but good. She stood switching her tail, and"
726,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,looking as savage as so mild an animal possibly could look.
727,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
728,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""It's all your doing, you naughty children! You have been playing her"
729,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"some trick, I know,"" cried the Gardener, in great wrath."
730,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
731,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"They assured him they had done nothing, and indeed, they looked as quiet"
732,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,as mice and as innocent as lambs. At length the biggest boy pointed out
733,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,a large wasp which had settled in Dolly's ear.
734,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
735,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""That accounts for everything,"" said the Gardener."
736,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
737,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,But it did not mend everything; for when he tried to drive it away it
738,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"kept coming back and back again, and buzzing round his own head and the"
739,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,cow's with a voice that the children thought was less like a buzz of a
740,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,wasp than the sound of a person laughing. At length it frightened Dolly
741,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"to such an extent that, with one wild bound she darted right away, and"
742,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,galloped off to the farther end of the field.
743,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
744,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""I'll get a rope and tie her legs together,"" cried the Gardener,"
745,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"fiercely. ""She shall repent giving me all this trouble--that she shall!"""
746,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
747,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Ha, ha, ha!"" laughed somebody. The Gardener thought it was the"
748,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"children, and gave one of them an angry cuff as he walked away. But they"
749,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"knew it was somebody else, and were not at all surprised when, the"
750,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"minute his back was turned, Dolly came walking quietly back, led by a"
751,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,little wee brown man who scarcely reached up to her knees. Yet she let
752,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"him guide her, which he did as gently as possible, though the string he"
753,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"held her by was no thicker than a spider web, floating from one of her"
754,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,horns.
755,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
756,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Soh, Dolly! good Dolly!"" cried Brownie, mimicking the Gardener's voice."
757,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Now we'll see what we can do. I want my breakfast badly--don't you,"
758,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"little folks?"""
759,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
760,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Of course they did, for the morning air made them very hungry."
761,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
762,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Very well--wait a bit, though. Old people should be served first, you"
763,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"know. Besides, I want to go to bed."""
764,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
765,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Go to bed in the daylight!"" The children all laughed, and then looked"
766,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"quite shy and sorry, lest they might have seemed rude to the little"
767,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Brownie. But he--he liked fun; and never took offence when none was
768,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,meant.
769,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
770,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"He placed himself on the milking-stool, which was so high that his"
771,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"little legs were dangling half-way down, and milked and milked--Dolly"
772,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,standing as still as possible--till he had filled the whole pail. Most
773,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,astonishing cow! she gave as much as two cows; and such delicious milk
774,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,as it was--all frothing and yellow--richer than even Dolly's milk had
775,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"ever been before. The children's mouths watered for it, but not a word"
776,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"said they--even when, instead of giving it to them, Brownie put his own"
777,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"mouth to the pail, and drank and drank, till it seemed as if he were"
778,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,never going to stop. But it was decidedly a relief to them when he
779,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"popped his head up again, and lo! the pail was as full as ever!"
780,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
781,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Now, little ones, now's your turn. Where are your mugs?"""
782,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
783,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"All answered mournfully, ""We've got none. Gardener made us take them"
784,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"back again."""
785,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
786,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Never mind--all right. Gather me half a dozen of the biggest buttercups"
787,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"you can find."""
788,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
789,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""What nonsense!"" thought the children; but they did it. Brownie laid the"
790,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"flowers in a row upon the eldest girl's lap--blew upon them one by one,"
791,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,and each turned into the most beautiful golden cup that ever was seen!
792,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
793,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Now, then, every one take his own mug, and I'll fill it."""
794,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
795,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"He milked away--each child got a drink, and then the cups were filled"
796,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,again. And all the while Dolly stood as quiet as possible--looking
797,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"benignly round, as if she would be happy to supply milk to the whole"
798,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"parish, if the Brownie desired it."
799,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
800,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Soh, Dolly! Thank you, Dolly!"" said he, again, mimicking the Gardener's"
801,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"voice, half growling, half coaxing. And while he spoke, the real voice"
802,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,was heard behind the hedge. There was a sound as of a great wasp flying
803,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"away, which made Dolly prick up her ears, and look as if the old"
804,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,savageness was coming back upon her. The children snatched up their
805,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"mugs, but there was no need, they had all turned into buttercups again."
806,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
807,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Gardener jumped over the stile, as cross as two sticks, with an old rope"
808,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,in his hand.
809,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
810,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Oh, what a bother I've had! Breakfast ready, and no milk yet--and such"
811,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"a row as they are making over those lost ducklings. Stand back, you"
812,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"children, and don't hinder me a minute. No use begging--not a drop of"
813,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"milk shall you get. Hillo, Dolly? Quiet old girl!"""
814,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
815,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Quiet enough she was this time--but you might as well have milked a
816,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,plaster cow in a London milking-shop. Not one ringing drop resounded
817,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"against the empty pail; for, when they peeped in, the children saw, to"
818,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"their amazement, that it was empty."
819,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
820,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"[Illustration: Each child got a drink, and then the cups were filled"
821,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,again.--Page 32]
822,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
823,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""The creature's bewitched!"" cried the Gardener, in a great fury. ""Or"
824,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"else somebody has milked her dry already. Have you done it? or you?"" he"
825,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,asked each of the children.
826,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
827,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,They might have said No--which was the literal truth--but then it would
828,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"not have been the whole truth, for they knew quite well that Dolly had"
829,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"been milked, and also who had done it. And their mother had always"
830,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,taught them that to make a person believe a lie is nearly as bad as
831,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,telling him one. Yet still they did not like to betray the kind little
832,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Brownie. Greatly puzzled, they hung their heads and said nothing."
833,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
834,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Look in your pail again,"" cried a voice from the other side of Dolly."
835,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,And there at the bottom was just the usual quantity of milk--no more and
836,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,no less.
837,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
838,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"The Gardener was very much astonished. ""It must be the Brownie!"""
839,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"muttered he, in a frightened tone; and, taking off his hat, ""Thank you,"
840,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"sir,"" said he to Mr. Nobody--at which the children all burst out"
841,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"laughing. But they kept their own counsel, and he was afraid to ask them"
842,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,any more questions.
843,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
844,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"By-and-by his fright wore off a little. ""I only hope the milk is good"
845,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"milk, and will poison nobody,"" said he, sulkily. ""However, that's not my"
846,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,affair. You children had better tell your mother all about it. I left
847,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"her in the farmyard in a pretty state of mind about her ducklings."""
848,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
849,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Perhaps Brownie heard this, and was sorry, for he liked the children's"
850,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"mother, who had always been kind to him. Besides, he never did any body"
851,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"harm who did not deserve it; and though, being a Brownie, he could"
852,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"hardly be said to have a conscience, he had something which stood in the"
853,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,place of one--a liking to see people happy rather than miserable.
854,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
855,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"So, instead of going to bed under his big coal for the day, when, after"
856,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"breakfast, the children and their mother came out to look at a new brood"
857,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"of chickens, he crept after them and hid behind the hencoop where the"
858,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"old mother-hen was put, with her young ones round her."
859,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
860,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"There had been great difficulty in getting her in there, for she was a"
861,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,hen who hatched her brood on independent principles. Instead of sitting
862,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"upon the nice nest that the Gardener made for her, she had twice gone"
863,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"into a little wood close by and made a nest for herself, which nobody"
864,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"could ever find; and where she hatched in secret, coming every second"
865,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"day to be fed, and then vanishing again, till at last she re-appeared in"
866,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"triumph, with her chickens running after her. The first brood there had"
867,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"been twelve, but of this there were fourteen--all from her own eggs, of"
868,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"course, and she was uncommonly proud of them. So was the Gardener, so"
869,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,was the mistress--who liked all young things. Such a picture as they
870,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"were! fourteen soft, yellow, fluffy things, running about after their"
871,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"mother. It had been a most troublesome business to catch--first her, and"
872,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"then them, to put them under the coop. The old hen resisted, and pecked"
873,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"furiously at Gardener's legs, and the chickens ran about in frantic"
874,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"terror, chirping wildly in answer to her clucking."
875,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
876,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"At last, however, the little family was safe in shelter, and the"
877,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"chickens counted over, to see that none had been lost in the scuffle."
878,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"How funny they were! looking so innocent and yet so wise, as chickens"
879,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"do--peering out at the world from under their mother's wing, or hopping"
880,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"over her back, or snuggled all together under her breast, so that"
881,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"nothing was seen of them but a mass of yellow legs, like a great"
882,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,centiped.
883,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
884,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""How happy the old hen is,"" said the children's mother, looking on, and"
885,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"then looking compassionately at that other forlorn old hen, who had"
886,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"hatched the ducklings, and kept wandering about the farmyard, clucking"
887,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"miserably, ""Those poor ducklings, what can have become of them? If rats"
888,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"had killed them, we should have found feathers or something; and weasels"
889,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,would have sucked their brains and left them. They must have been
890,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"stolen, or wandered away, and died of cold and hunger--my poor"
891,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"ducklings!"""
892,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
893,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"The mistress sighed, for she could not bear any living thing to suffer."
894,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,And the children nearly cried at the thought of what might be happening
895,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,to their pretty ducklings. That very minute a little wee brown face
896,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"peered through a hole in the hencoop, making the old mother-hen fly"
897,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,furiously at it--as she did at the slightest shadow of an enemy to her
898,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"little ones. However, no harm happened--only a guinea-fowl suddenly ran"
899,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"across the farmyard, screaming in its usual harsh voice. But it was not"
900,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"the usual sort of guinea-fowl, being larger and handsomer than any of"
901,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,theirs.
902,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
903,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Oh, what a beauty of a creature! how did it ever come into our"
904,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"farmyard,"" cried the delighted children; and started off after it, to"
905,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,catch it if possible.
906,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
907,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"But they ran, and they ran--through the gate and out into the lane; and"
908,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"the guinea-fowl still ran on before them, until, turning round a corner,"
909,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"they lost sight of it, and immediately saw something else, equally"
910,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,curious. Sitting on the top of a big thistle--so big that he must have
911,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,had to climb it just like a tree--was the Brownie. His legs were
912,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"crossed, and his arms too, his little brown cap was stuck knowingly on"
913,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"one side, and he was laughing heartily."
914,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
915,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""How do you do? Here I am again. I thought I wouldn't go to bed after"
916,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"all. Shall I help you to find the ducklings? Very well! come along."""
917,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
918,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"They crossed the field, Brownie running beside them, and as fast as they"
919,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"could, though he looked such an old man; and sometimes turning over on"
920,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"legs and arms like a Catherine wheel--which they tried to imitate, but"
921,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"generally failed, and only bruised their fingers and noses."
922,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
923,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"He lured them on and on till they came to the wood, and to a green path"
924,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"in it, which well as they knew the neighborhood, none of the children"
925,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"had ever seen before. It led to a most beautiful pond, as clear as"
926,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"crystal and as blue as the sky. Large trees grew round it, dipping their"
927,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"branches in the water, as if they were looking at themselves in a glass."
928,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,And all about their roots were quantities of primroses--the biggest
929,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,primroses the little girls had ever seen. Down they dropped on their fat
930,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"knees, squashing more primroses than they gathered, though they tried to"
931,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,gather them all; and the smallest child even began to cry because her
932,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,hands were so full that the flowers dropped through her fingers. But the
933,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"boys, older and more practical, rather despised primroses."
934,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
935,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""I thought we had come to look for ducklings,"" said the eldest. ""Mother"
936,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"is fretting dreadfully about her ducklings. Where can they be?"""
937,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
938,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Shut your eyes, and you'll see,"" said the Brownie, at which they all"
939,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"laughed, but did it; and when they opened their eyes again, what should"
940,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,they behold but a whole fleet of ducklings sailing out from the roots of
941,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"an old willow-tree, one after the other, looking as fat and content as"
942,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"possible, and swimming as naturally as if they had lived on a pond--and"
943,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"this particularly pond, all their days."
944,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
945,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Count them,"" said the Brownie, ""the whole eight--quite correct. And"
946,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"then try and catch them--if you can."""
947,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
948,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Easier said than done. The boys set to work with great
949,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,satisfaction--boys do so enjoy hunting something. They coaxed them--they
950,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,shouted at them--they threw little sticks at them; but as soon as they
951,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,wanted them to go one way the fleet of ducklings immediately turned
952,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"round and sailed another way, doing it so deliberately and majestically,"
953,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"that the children could not help laughing. As for little Brownie, he sat"
954,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"on a branch of the willow-tree, with his legs dangling down to the"
955,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"surface of the pond, kicking at the water-spiders, and grinning with all"
956,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"his might. At length, quite tired out, in spite of their fun, the"
957,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"children begged for his help, and he took compassion on them."
958,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
959,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"""Turn round three times and see what you can find,"" shouted he."
960,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
961,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Immediately each little boy found in his arms, and each little girl in"
962,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"her pinafore, a fine fat duckling. And there being eight of them, the"
963,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"two elder children had each a couple. They were rather cold and damp,"
964,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"and slightly uncomfortable to cuddle, ducks not being used to cuddling."
965,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Poor things! they struggled hard to get away. But the children hugged
966,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"them tight, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them through the"
967,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"wood, forgetting, in their joy, even to say ""Thank you"" to the little"
968,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,Brownie.
969,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
970,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"When they reached their mother she was as glad as they, for she never"
971,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,thought to see her ducklings again; and to have them back alive and
972,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"uninjured, and watch them running to the old hen, who received them with"
973,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"an ecstasy of delight, was so exciting, that nobody thought of asking a"
974,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,single question as to where they had been found.
975,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
976,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"When the mother did ask, the children told her about Brownie's taking"
977,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,them to the beautiful pond--and what a wonderful pond it was; how green
978,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,the trees were round it; and how large the primroses grew. They never
979,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,tired of talking about it and seeking for it. But the odd thing was
980,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"that, seek as they might, they never could find it again. Many a day did"
981,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"the little people roam about one by one, or all together, round the"
982,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"wood, often getting themselves sadly draggled with mud and torn with"
983,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,brambles--but the beautiful pond they never found again.
984,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,
985,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"Nor did the ducklings, I suppose; for they wandered no more from the"
986,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"farmyard, to the old mother-hen's great content. They grew up into fat"
987,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,and respectable ducks--five white ones and three gray ones--waddling
988,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"about, very content, though they never saw water, except the tank which"
989,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"was placed for them to paddle in. They lived a lazy, peaceful, pleasant"
990,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"life for a long time, and were at last killed and eaten with green peas,"
991,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,"one after the other, to the family's great satisfaction, if not to their"
992,BROWNIE IN THE FARMYARD,own.

1004,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1005,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1006,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"FOR the little Brownie, though not given to horsemanship, did once take"
1007,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"a ride, and a very remarkable one it was. Shall I tell you all about it?"
1008,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1009,BROWNIE'S RIDE,The six little children got a present of something they had longed for
1010,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"all their lives--a pony. Not a rocking-horse, but a real live pony--a"
1011,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Shetland pony, too, which had traveled all the way from the Shetland"
1012,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Isles to Devonshire--where every body wondered at it, for such a"
1013,BROWNIE'S RIDE,creature had not been seen in the neighborhood for years and years. She
1014,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"was no bigger than a donkey, and her coat, instead of being smooth like"
1015,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"a horse's, was shaggy like a young bear's. She had a long tail, which"
1016,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"had never been cut, and such a deal of hair in her mane and over her"
1017,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"eyes that it gave her quite a fierce countenance. In fact, among the"
1018,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"mild and tame Devonshire beasts, the little Shetland pony looked almost"
1019,BROWNIE'S RIDE,like a wild animal. But in reality she was the gentlest creature in the
1020,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"world. Before she had been many days with them, she began to know the"
1021,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"children quite well; followed them about, ate corn out of the bowl they"
1022,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"held out to her; nay, one day, when the eldest little girl offered her"
1023,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"bread-and-butter, she stooped her head and took it from the child's"
1024,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"hand, just like a young lady. Indeed, Jess--that was her name--was"
1025,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"altogether so lady-like in her behavior, that more than once Cook"
1026,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"allowed her to walk in at the back-door, when she stood politely warming"
1027,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"her nose at the kitchen-fire for a minute or two, then turned round and"
1028,BROWNIE'S RIDE,as politely walked out again. But she never did any mischief; and was so
1029,BROWNIE'S RIDE,quiet and gentle a creature that she bade fair soon to become as great a
1030,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"pet in the household as the dog, the cat, the kittens, the puppies, the"
1031,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"fowls, the ducks, the cow, the pig, and all the other members of the"
1032,BROWNIE'S RIDE,family.
1033,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1034,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"The only one who disliked her, and grumbled at her, was the Gardener."
1035,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"This was odd; because, though cross to children, the old man was kind to"
1036,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"dumb beasts. Even his pig knew his voice and grunted, and held out his"
1037,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"nose to be scratched; and he always gave each successive pig a name,"
1038,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jack or Dick, and called them by it, and was quite affectionate to them,"
1039,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"one after the other, until the very day that they were killed. But they"
1040,BROWNIE'S RIDE,were English pigs--and the pony was Scotch--and the Devonshire Gardener
1041,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"hated every thing Scotch, he said; besides, he was not used to groom's"
1042,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"work, and the pony required such a deal of grooming on account of her"
1043,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"long hair. More than once Gardener threatened to clip it short, and turn"
1044,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"her into a regular English pony, but the children were in such distress"
1045,BROWNIE'S RIDE,and mother forbade any such spoiling of Jessie's personal appearance.
1046,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1047,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"At length, to keep things smooth, and to avoid the rough words and even"
1048,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"blows which poor Jess sometimes got, they sought in the village for a"
1049,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"boy to look after her, and found a great rough, shock-headed lad named"
1050,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Bill, who, for a few shillings a week, consented to come up every"
1051,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"morning and learn the beginning of a groom's business; hoping to end, as"
1052,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"his mother said he should, in sitting, like the squire's fat coachman,"
1053,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"as broad as he was long, on the top of the hammer-cloth of a grand"
1054,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"carriage, and do nothing all day but drive a pair of horses as stout as"
1055,BROWNIE'S RIDE,himself a few miles along the road and back again.
1056,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1057,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Bill would have liked this very much, he thought, if he could have been"
1058,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"a coachman all at once, for if there was one thing he disliked, it was"
1059,BROWNIE'S RIDE,work. He much preferred to lie in the sun all day and do nothing; and he
1060,BROWNIE'S RIDE,only agreed to come and take care of Jess because she was such a very
1061,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"little pony, that looking after her seemed next door to doing nothing."
1062,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But when he tried it, he found his mistake. True, Jess was a very gentle"
1063,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"beast, so quiet that the old mother-hen with fourteen chicks used,"
1064,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"instead of roosting with the rest of the fowls, to come regularly into"
1065,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"the portion of the cow-shed which was partitioned off for a stable, and"
1066,BROWNIE'S RIDE,settle under a corner of Jess's manger for the night; and in the morning
1067,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the chicks would be seen running about fearlessly among her feet and
1068,BROWNIE'S RIDE,under her very nose.
1069,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1070,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But, for all that, she required a little management, for she did not"
1071,BROWNIE'S RIDE,like her long hair to be roughly handled; it took a long time to clean
1072,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"her; and, though she did not scream out like some silly little children"
1073,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"when her hair was combed, I am afraid she sometimes kicked and bounced"
1074,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"about, giving Bill a deal of trouble--all the more trouble, the more"
1075,BROWNIE'S RIDE,impatient Bill was.
1076,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1077,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"And then he had to keep within call, for the children wanted their pony"
1078,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"at all hours. She was their own especial property, and they insisted"
1079,BROWNIE'S RIDE,upon learning to ride--even before they got a saddle. Hard work it was
1080,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"to stick on Jess's bare back, but by degrees the boys did it, turn and"
1081,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"turn about, and even gave their sisters a turn too--a very little"
1082,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"one--just once round the field and back again, which was quite enough,"
1083,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"they considered, for girls. But they were very kind to their little"
1084,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"sisters, held them on so that they could not fall, and led Jess"
1085,BROWNIE'S RIDE,carefully and quietly: and altogether behaved as elder brothers should.
1086,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1087,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Nor did they squabble very much among themselves, though sometimes it"
1088,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"was rather difficult to keep their turns all fair, and remember"
1089,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"accurately which was which. But they did their best, being, on the"
1090,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"whole, extremely good children. And they were so happy to have their"
1091,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"pony, that they would have been ashamed to quarrel over her."
1092,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1093,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Also, one very curious thing kept them on their good behavior. Whenever"
1094,BROWNIE'S RIDE,they did begin to misconduct themselves--to want to ride out of their
1095,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"turns, or to domineer over one another, or the boys, joining together,"
1096,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"tried to domineer over the girls, as I grieve to say boys not seldom"
1097,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"do--they used to hear in the air, right over their heads, the crack of"
1098,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"an unseen whip. It was none of theirs, for they had not got a whip; that"
1099,BROWNIE'S RIDE,was a felicity which their father had promised when they could all ride
1100,BROWNIE'S RIDE,like a young gentleman and ladies; but there was no mistaking the
1101,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"sound--indeed, it always startled Jess so that she set off galloping,"
1102,BROWNIE'S RIDE,and could not be caught again for many minutes.
1103,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1104,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"This happened several times, until one of them said, ""Perhaps it's the"
1105,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Brownie."" Whether it was or not, it made them behave better for a good"
1106,BROWNIE'S RIDE,while; till one unfortunate day the two eldest began contending which
1107,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"should ride foremost and which hindmost on Jess's back, when"
1108,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Crick--crack!"" went the whip in the air, frightening the pony so much"
1109,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"that she kicked up her heels, tossed both the boys over her head, and"
1110,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"scampered off, followed by a loud ""Ha, ha, ha!"""
1111,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1112,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"It certainly did not come from the two boys, who had fallen--quite"
1113,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"safely, but rather unpleasantly--into a large nettle-bed; whence they"
1114,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"crawled out, rubbing their arms and legs, and looking too much ashamed"
1115,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"to complain. But they were rather frightened and a little cross, for"
1116,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jess took a skittish fit, and refused to be caught and mounted again,"
1117,BROWNIE'S RIDE,till the bell rang for school--when she grew as meek as possible. Too
1118,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"late--for the children were obliged to run indoors, and got no more"
1119,BROWNIE'S RIDE,rides for the whole day.
1120,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1121,BROWNIE'S RIDE,Jess was from this incident supposed to be on the same friendly terms
1122,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"with Brownie as were the rest of the household. Indeed, when she came,"
1123,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the children had taken care to lead her up to the coal-cellar door and
1124,BROWNIE'S RIDE,introduce her properly--for they knew Brownie was very jealous of
1125,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"strangers, and often played them tricks. But after that piece of"
1126,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"civility he would be sure, they thought, to take her under his"
1127,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"protection. And sometimes, when the little Shetlander was restless and"
1128,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"pricked up her ears, looking preternaturally wise under those shaggy"
1129,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"brows of hers, the children used to say to one another, ""Perhaps she"
1130,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"sees the Brownie."""
1131,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1132,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Whether she did or not, Jess sometimes seemed to see a good deal that"
1133,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"others did not see, and was apparently a favorite with the Brownie, for"
1134,BROWNIE'S RIDE,she grew and thrived so much that she soon became the pride and delight
1135,BROWNIE'S RIDE,of the children and of the whole family. You would hardly have known her
1136,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"for the rough, shaggy, half-starved little beast that had arrived a few"
1137,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"weeks before. Her coat was so silky, her limbs so graceful, and her head"
1138,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"so full of intelligence, that every body admired her. Then even Gardener"
1139,BROWNIE'S RIDE,began to admire her too.
1140,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1141,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""I think I'll get upon her back; it will save me walking down to the"
1142,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"village,"" said he, one day. And she actually carried him--though, as his"
1143,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"feet nearly touched the ground, it looked as if the man were carrying"
1144,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"the pony, and not the pony the man. And the children laughed so"
1145,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"immoderately, that he never tried it afterward."
1146,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1147,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Nor Bill neither, though he had once thought he should like a ride, and"
1148,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"got astride on Jess; but she quickly ducked her head down, and he"
1149,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"tumbled over it. Evidently she had her own tastes as to her riders, and"
1150,BROWNIE'S RIDE,much preferred little people to big ones.
1151,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1152,BROWNIE'S RIDE,Pretty Jess! when cantering round the paddock with the young folk she
1153,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"really was quite a picture. And when at last she got a saddle--a new,"
1154,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"beautiful saddle, with a pommel to take off and on, so as to suit both"
1155,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"boys and girls--how proud they all were, Jess included! That day they"
1156,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"were allowed to take her into the market-town--Gardener leading her, as"
1157,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Bill could not be trusted--and every body, even the blacksmith, who"
1158,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"hoped by-and-by to have the pleasure of shoeing her, said, what a"
1159,BROWNIE'S RIDE,beautiful pony she was!
1160,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1161,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"After this, Gardener treated Jess a great deal better, and showed Bill"
1162,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"how to groom her, and kept him close at it too, which Bill did not like"
1163,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"at all. He was a very lazy lad, and whenever he could shirk work he did"
1164,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"it; and many a time when the children wanted Jess, either there was"
1165,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"nobody to saddle her, or she had not been properly groomed, or Bill was"
1166,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"away at his dinner, and they had to wait till he came back and could put"
1167,BROWNIE'S RIDE,her in order to be taken out for a ride like a genteel animal--which I
1168,BROWNIE'S RIDE,am afraid neither pony nor children enjoyed half so much as the old ways
1169,BROWNIE'S RIDE,before Bill came.
1170,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1171,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Still, they were gradually becoming excellent little horsemen and"
1172,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"horsewomen--even the youngest, only four years old, whom all the rest"
1173,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"were very tender over, and who was often held on Jess's back and given a"
1174,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"ride out of her turn because she was a good little girl, and never cried"
1175,BROWNIE'S RIDE,for it. And seldomer and seldomer was heard the mysterious sound of the
1176,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"whip in the air, which warned them of quarreling--Brownie hated"
1177,BROWNIE'S RIDE,quarreling.
1178,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1179,BROWNIE'S RIDE,[Illustration: Jess quickly ducked her head down and Bill tumbled over
1180,BROWNIE'S RIDE,it.]
1181,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1182,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"In fact, their only trouble was Bill, who never came to his work in"
1183,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"time, and never did things when wanted, and was ill-natured, lazy, and"
1184,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"cross to the children, so that they disliked him very much."
1185,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1186,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""I wish the Brownie would punish you,"" said one of the boys; ""you'd"
1187,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"behave better then."""
1188,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1189,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""The Brownie!"" cried Bill, contemptuously; ""if I caught him, I'd kick"
1190,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"him up in the air like this!"""
1191,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1192,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"And he kicked up his cap--his only cap, it was--which, strange to"
1193,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"relate, flew right up, ever so high, and lodged at the very top of a"
1194,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"tree which overhung the stable, where it dangled for weeks and weeks,"
1195,BROWNIE'S RIDE,during which time poor Bill had to go bareheaded.
1196,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1197,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"He was very much vexed, and revenged himself by vexing the children in"
1198,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"all sorts of ways. They would have told their mother, and asked her to"
1199,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"send Bill away, only she had a great many anxieties just then, for their"
1200,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"old grandmother was very ill, and they did not like to make a fuss about"
1201,BROWNIE'S RIDE,any thing that would trouble her.
1202,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1203,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"So Bill staid on, and nobody found out what a bad, ill-natured, lazy boy"
1204,BROWNIE'S RIDE,he was.
1205,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1206,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But one day the mother was sent for suddenly, not knowing when she"
1207,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"should be able to come home again. She was very sad, and so were the"
1208,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"children, for they loved their grandmother--and as the carriage drove"
1209,BROWNIE'S RIDE,off they all stood crying round the front-door for ever so long.
1210,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1211,BROWNIE'S RIDE,The servants even cried too--all but Bill.
1212,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1213,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""It's an ill wind that blows nobody good,"" said he. ""What a jolly time I"
1214,BROWNIE'S RIDE,shall have! I'll do nothing all day long. Those troublesome children
1215,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"sha'n't have Jess to ride; I'll keep her in the stable, and then she"
1216,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"won't get dirty, and I shall have no trouble in cleaning her. Hurrah!"
1217,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"what fun!"""
1218,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1219,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"He put his hands in his pockets, and sat whistling the best part of the"
1220,BROWNIE'S RIDE,afternoon.
1221,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1222,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"The children had been so unhappy, that for that day they quite forgot"
1223,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jess; but next morning, after lessons were over, they came begging for a"
1224,BROWNIE'S RIDE,ride.
1225,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1226,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""You can't get one. The stable-door's locked and I've lost the key."" (He"
1227,BROWNIE'S RIDE,had it in his pocket all the time.)
1228,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1229,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""How is poor Jess to get her dinner?"" cried a thoughtful little girl."
1230,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Oh, how hungry she will be!"""
1231,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1232,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"And the child was quite in distress, as were the two other girls. But"
1233,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the boys were more angry than sorry.
1234,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1235,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""It was very stupid of you, Bill, to lose the key. Look about and find"
1236,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"it, or else break open the door."""
1237,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1238,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""I won't,"" said Bill; ""I dare say the key will turn up before night, and"
1239,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"if it doesn't, who cares? You get riding enough and too much. I'll not"
1240,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"bother myself about it, or Jess either."""
1241,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1242,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"And Bill sauntered away. He was a big fellow, and the little lads were"
1243,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"rather afraid of him. But as he walked, he could not keep his hand out"
1244,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"of his trowsers-pocket, where the key felt growing heavier and heavier,"
1245,BROWNIE'S RIDE,till he expected it every minute to tumble through and come out at his
1246,BROWNIE'S RIDE,boots--convicting him before all the children of having told a lie.
1247,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1248,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Nobody was in the habit of telling lies to them, so they never suspected"
1249,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"him, but went innocently searching about for the key--Bill all the while"
1250,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"clutching it fast. But every time he touched it, he felt his fingers"
1251,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"pinched, as if there was a cockroach in his pocket--or little"
1252,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"lobster--or something, anyhow, that had claws. At last, fairly"
1253,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"frightened, he made an excuse to go into the cow-shed, took the key out"
1254,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"of his pocket and looked at it, and finally hid it in a corner of the"
1255,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"manger, among the hay."
1256,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1257,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"As he did so, he heard a most extraordinary laugh, which was certainly"
1258,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"not from Dolly the cow, and, as he went out of the shed, he felt the"
1259,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"same sort of pinch at his ankles, which made him so angry that he kept"
1260,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"striking with his whip in all directions, but hit nobody for nobody was"
1261,BROWNIE'S RIDE,there.
1262,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1263,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But Jess--who, as soon as she heard the children's voices, set up a most"
1264,BROWNIE'S RIDE,melancholy whinnying behind the locked stable-door--began to neigh
1265,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"energetically. And Boxer barked, and the hens cackled, and the"
1266,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"guinea-fowls cried ""Come back, come back!"" in their usual insane"
1267,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"fashion--indeed, the whole farmyard seemed in such an excited state,"
1268,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"that the children got frightened lest Gardener should scold them, and"
1269,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"ran away, leaving Bill master of the field."
1270,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1271,BROWNIE'S RIDE,What an idle day he had! How he sat on the wall with his hands in his
1272,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"pockets, and lounged upon the fence, and sauntered around the garden! At"
1273,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"length, absolutely tired of doing nothing, he went and talked with the"
1274,BROWNIE'S RIDE,Gardener's wife while she was hanging out her clothes. Gardener had gone
1275,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"down to the lower field, with all the little folks after him, so that he"
1276,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"knew nothing of Bill's idling, or it might have come to an end."
1277,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1278,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"By-and-by Bill thought it was time to go home to his supper. ""But first"
1279,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"I'll give Jess her corn,"" said he, ""double quantity, and then I need not"
1280,BROWNIE'S RIDE,come back to give her her breakfast so early in the morning. Soh! you
1281,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"greedy beast! I'll be at you presently, if you don't stop that noise."""
1282,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1283,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"For Jess, at sound of his footsteps, was heard to whinny in the most"
1284,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"imploring manner, enough to have melted a heart of stone."
1285,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1286,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""The key--where on earth did I put the key?"" cried Bill, whose constant"
1287,BROWNIE'S RIDE,habit it was to lay things out of his hand and then forget where he had
1288,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"put them, causing himself endless loss of time in searching for them--as"
1289,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"now. At last he suddenly remembered the corner of the cow's manger,"
1290,BROWNIE'S RIDE,where he felt sure he had left it. But the key was not there.
1291,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1292,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""You can't have eaten it, you silly old cow,"" said he, striking Dolly on"
1293,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the nose as she rubbed herself against him--she was an affectionate
1294,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"beast. ""Nor you, you stupid old hen!"" kicking the mother of the brood,"
1295,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"who, with her fourteen chicks, being shut out of their usual"
1296,BROWNIE'S RIDE,roosting-place--Jess's stable--kept pecking about under Dolly's legs.
1297,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""It can't have gone without hands--of course it can't."" But most"
1298,BROWNIE'S RIDE,certainly the key was gone.
1299,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1300,BROWNIE'S RIDE,What in the world should Bill do? Jess kept on making a pitiful
1301,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"complaining. No wonder, as she had not tasted food since morning. It"
1302,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"would have made any kind-hearted person quite sad to hear her, thinking"
1303,BROWNIE'S RIDE,how exceedingly hungry the poor pony must be.
1304,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1305,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Little did Bill care for that, or for anything, except that he should be"
1306,BROWNIE'S RIDE,sure to get into trouble as soon as he was found out. When he heard
1307,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Gardener coming into the farmyard, with the children after him, Bill"
1308,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"bolted over the wall like a flash of lightning, and ran away home,"
1309,BROWNIE'S RIDE,leaving poor Jess to her fate.
1310,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1311,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"All the way he seemed to hear at his heels a little dog yelping, and"
1312,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"then a swarm of gnats buzzing round his head, and altogether was so"
1313,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"perplexed and bewildered, that when he got into his mother's cottage he"
1314,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"escaped into bed, and pulled the blanket over his ears to shut out the"
1315,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"noise of the dog and the gnats, which at last turned into a sound like"
1316,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"somebody laughing. It was not his mother, she didn't often laugh, poor"
1317,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"soul!--Bill bothered her quite too much for that, and he knew it."
1318,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Dreadfully frightened, he hid his head under the bedclothes, determined"
1319,BROWNIE'S RIDE,to go to sleep and think about nothing till next day.
1320,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1321,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Meantime Gardener returned, with all the little people trooping after"
1322,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"him. He had been rather kinder to them than usual this day, because he"
1323,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"knew their mother had gone away in trouble, and now he let them help him"
1324,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"to roll the gravel, and fetch up Dolly to be milked, and watch him milk"
1325,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"her in the cow-shed--where, it being nearly winter, she always spent the"
1326,BROWNIE'S RIDE,night now. They were so well amused that they forgot all about their
1327,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"disappointment as to the ride, and Jess did not remind them of it by"
1328,BROWNIE'S RIDE,her whinnying. For as soon as Bill was gone she grew silent.
1329,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1330,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"At last one little girl, the one who had cried over Jess's being left"
1331,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"hungry, remembered the poor pony, and, peeping through a crevice in the"
1332,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"cow-shed, saw her stand contentedly munching at a large bowlful of corn."
1333,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1334,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""So Bill did find the key. I'm very glad,"" thought the kind little"
1335,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"maiden, and to make sure looked again, when--what do you think she"
1336,BROWNIE'S RIDE,beheld squatting on the manger? Something brown--either a large brown
1337,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"rat, or a small brown man. But she held her tongue, since, being a very"
1338,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"little girl, people sometimes laughed at her for the strange things she"
1339,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"saw. She was quite certain she did see them, for all that."
1340,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1341,BROWNIE'S RIDE,So she and the rest of the children went indoors and to bed. When they
1342,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"were fast asleep, something happened. Something so curious, that the"
1343,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"youngest boy, who, thinking he heard Jess neighing, got up to look out,"
1344,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"was afraid to tell, lest he too should be laughed at, and went back to"
1345,BROWNIE'S RIDE,bed immediately.
1346,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1347,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"In the middle of the night, a little old brown man carrying a lantern,"
1348,BROWNIE'S RIDE,or at least having a light in his hand that looked like a lantern--went
1349,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"and unlocked Jess's stable, and patted her pretty head. At first she"
1350,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"started, but soon she grew quiet and pleased, and let him do what he"
1351,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"chose with her. He began rubbing her down, making the same funny hissing"
1352,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"with his mouth that Bill did, and all grooms do--I never could find out"
1353,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"why. But Jess evidently liked it, and stood as good as possible."
1354,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1355,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"[Illustration: Up the bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping.--Page"
1356,BROWNIE'S RIDE,55]
1357,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1358,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Isn't it nice to be clean?"" said the wee man, talking to her as if she"
1359,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"were a human being, or a Brownie. ""And I dare say your poor little"
1360,BROWNIE'S RIDE,legs ache with standing so long. Shall we have a run together? the moon
1361,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"shines bright in the clear, cold night. Dear me! I'm talking poetry."""
1362,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1363,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But Brownies are not poetical fairies, quite commonplace, and up to all"
1364,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"sorts of work. So, while he talked, he was saddling and bridling Jess,"
1365,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"she not objecting in the least. Finally, he jumped on her back."
1366,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1367,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""'Off, said the stranger--off, off, and away!'"" sang Brownie mimicking a"
1368,BROWNIE'S RIDE,song of the Cook's. People in that house often heard their songs
1369,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"repeated in the oddest way, from room to room, everybody fancying it was"
1370,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"somebody else that did it. But it was only the Brownie. ""Now, 'A"
1371,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting morning!'"""
1372,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1373,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Or night--for it was the middle of the night, though bright as day--and"
1374,BROWNIE'S RIDE,Jess galloped and the Brownie sat on her back as merrily as if they had
1375,BROWNIE'S RIDE,gone hunting together all their days.
1376,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1377,BROWNIE'S RIDE,Such a steeple-chase it was! They cleared the farmyard at a single
1378,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"bound, and went flying down the road, and across the ploughed field, and"
1379,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"into the wood. Then out into the open country, and by-and-by into a"
1380,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"dark, muddy lane--and oh! how muddy Devonshire lanes can be sometimes!"
1381,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1382,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Let's go into the water to wash ourselves,"" said Brownie, and coaxed"
1383,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jess into a deep stream, which she swam as bravely as possible--she had"
1384,BROWNIE'S RIDE,not had such a frolic since she left her native Shetland Isles. Up the
1385,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"bank she scrambled, her long hair dripping as if she had been a"
1386,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"water-dog instead of a pony. Brownie, too, shook himself like a rat or a"
1387,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"beaver, throwing a shower round him in all directions."
1388,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1389,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Never mind; at it again, my lass!"" and he urged Jess into the water"
1390,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"once more. Out she came, wetter and brisker than ever, and went back"
1391,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"home again through the lane, and the wood, and the ploughed field,"
1392,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"galloping like the wind, and tossing back her ears and mane and tail,"
1393,BROWNIE'S RIDE,perfectly frantic with enjoyment.
1394,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1395,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But when she reached her stable, the plight she was in would have driven"
1396,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"any respectable groom frantic too. Her sides were white with foam, and"
1397,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the mud was sticking all over her like a plaster. As for her beautiful
1398,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"long hair, it was all caked together in a tangle, as if all the combs in"
1399,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the world would never make it smooth again. Her mane especially was
1400,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"plaited into knots, which people in Devonshire call elf-locks, and say,"
1401,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"when they find them on their horses, that it is because the fairies have"
1402,BROWNIE'S RIDE,been riding them.
1403,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1404,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Certainly, poor Jess had been pretty well ridden that night. When just"
1405,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"as the dawn began to break, Gardener got up and looked into the"
1406,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"farmyard, his sharp eye caught sight of the stable-door wide open."
1407,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1408,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"""Well done, Bill,"" shouted he, ""up early at last. One hour before"
1409,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"breakfast is worth three after."""
1410,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1411,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But no Bill was there; only Jess, trembling and shaking, all in a foam,"
1412,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"and muddy from head to foot, but looking perfectly cheerful in her mind."
1413,BROWNIE'S RIDE,And out from under her fore legs ran a small creature which Gardener
1414,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"mistook for Tiny, only Tiny was gray, and this dog was brown, of course!"
1415,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1416,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"I should not like to tell you all that was said to Bill when, an hour"
1417,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"after breakfast-time, he came skulking up to the farm. In fact, words"
1418,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"failing, Gardener took a good stick and laid it about Bill's shoulders,"
1419,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"saying he would either do this, or tell the mistress of him, and how he"
1420,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"had left the stable-door open all night, and some bad fellow had stolen"
1421,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jess, and galloped her all across the country, till, if she hadn't been"
1422,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"the cleverest pony in the world, she never could have got back again."
1423,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1424,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Bill durst not contradict this explanation of the story, especially as"
1425,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the key was found hanging up in its proper place by the kitchen door.
1426,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"And when he went to fetch it, he heard the most extraordinary sound in"
1427,BROWNIE'S RIDE,the coal-cellar close by--like somebody snoring or laughing. Bill took
1428,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"to his heels, and did not come back for a whole hour."
1429,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1430,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"But when he did come back, he made himself as busy as possible. He"
1431,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"cleaned Jess, which was half a day's work at least. Then he took the"
1432,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"little people a ride, and afterward put his stable in the most beautiful"
1433,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"order, and altogether was such a changed Bill, that Gardener told him he"
1434,BROWNIE'S RIDE,must have left himself at home and brought back somebody else: whether
1435,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"or not, the boy certainly improved, so that there was less occasion to"
1436,BROWNIE'S RIDE,find fault with him afterward.
1437,BROWNIE'S RIDE,
1438,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"Jess lived to be quite an old pony, and carried a great many"
1439,BROWNIE'S RIDE,"people--little people always, for she herself never grew any bigger. But"
1440,BROWNIE'S RIDE,I don't think she ever carried a Brownie again.

1452,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1453,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1454,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,WINTER was a grand time with the six little children especially when
1455,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,they had frost and snow. This happened seldom enough for it to be the
1456,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,greatest possible treat when it did happen; and it never lasted very
1457,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"long, for the winters are warm in Devonshire."
1458,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1459,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"There was a little lake three fields off, which made the most splendid"
1460,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,sliding-place imaginable. No skaters went near it--it was not large
1461,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"enough; and besides, there was nobody to skate, the neighborhood being"
1462,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,lonely. The lake itself looked the loneliest place imaginable. It was
1463,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,not very deep--not deep enough to drown a man--but it had a gravelly
1464,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"bottom, and was always very clear. Also, the trees round it grew so"
1465,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"thick that they sheltered it completely from the wind, so, when it did"
1466,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"freeze, it generally froze as smooth as a sheet of glass."
1467,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1468,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""The lake bears!"" was such a grand event, and so rare, that when it did"
1469,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"occur, the news came at once to the farm, and the children carried it as"
1470,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"quickly to their mother. For she had promised them that, if such a"
1471,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,thing did happen this year--it did not happen every year--lessons should
1472,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"be stopped entirely, and they should all go down to the lake and slide,"
1473,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"if they liked, all day long."
1474,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1475,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"So one morning, just before Christmas, the eldest boy ran in with a"
1476,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,countenance of great delight.
1477,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1478,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Mother, mother, the lake bears!"" (It was rather a compliment to call it"
1479,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"a lake, it being only about twenty yards across and forty long.) ""The"
1480,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"lake really bears!"""
1481,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1482,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Who says so?"""
1483,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1484,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Bill. Bill has been on it for an hour this morning, and has made us two"
1485,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"such beautiful slides, he says--an upslide and a down-slide. May we go"
1486,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"directly?"""
1487,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1488,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,The mother hesitated.
1489,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1490,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""You promised, you know,"" pleaded the children."
1491,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1492,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Very well, then; only be careful."""
1493,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1494,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""And may we slide all day long, and never come home for dinner or any"
1495,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"thing?"""
1496,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1497,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Yes, if you like. Only Gardener must go with you, and stay all day."""
1498,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1499,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"This they did not like at all; nor, when Gardener was spoken to, did he."
1500,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1501,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""You bothering children! I wish you may all get a good ducking in the"
1502,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"lake! Serve you right for making me lose a day's work, just to look"
1503,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,after you little monkeys. I've a great mind to tell your mother I won't
1504,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"do it."""
1505,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1506,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But he did not, being fond of his mistress. He was also fond of his"
1507,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"work, but he had no notion of play. I think the saying of, ""All work and"
1508,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"no play makes Jack a dull boy,"" must have been applied to him, for"
1509,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Gardener, whatever he had been as a boy, was certainly a dull and"
1510,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,melancholy man. The children used to say that if he and idle Bill could
1511,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"have been kneaded into one, and baked in the oven--a very warm"
1512,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,oven--they would have come out rather a pleasant person.
1513,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1514,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"As it was, Gardener was any thing but a pleasant person; above all, to"
1515,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"spend a long day with, and on the ice, where one needs all one's"
1516,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"cheerfulness and good-humor to bear pinched fingers and numbed toes, and"
1517,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"trips and tumbles, and various uncomfortablenesses."
1518,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1519,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""He'll growl at us all day long--he'll be a regular spoil-sport!"""
1520,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"lamented the children. ""Oh! mother, mightn't we go alone?"""
1521,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1522,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""No!"" said the mother; and her ""No"" meant no, though she was always very"
1523,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"kind. They argued the point no more, but started off, rather"
1524,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"downhearted. But soon they regained their spirits, for it was a bright,"
1525,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"clear, frosty day--the sun shining, though not enough to melt the ice,"
1526,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"and just sufficient to lie like a thin sprinkling over the grass, and"
1527,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,turn the brown branches into white ones. The little people danced along
1528,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"to keep themselves warm, carrying between them a basket which held their"
1529,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,lunch. A very harmless lunch it was--just a large brown loaf and a lump
1530,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"of cheese, and a knife to cut it with. Tossing the basket about in their"
1531,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"fun, they managed to tumble the knife out, and were having a search for"
1532,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"it in the long grass, when Gardener came up, grumpily enough."
1533,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1534,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""To think of trusting you children with one of the table-knives and a"
1535,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,basket! what a fool Cook must be! I'll tell her so; and if they're lost
1536,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"she'll blame me: give me the things."""
1537,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1538,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"He put the knife angrily in one pocket. ""Perhaps it will cut a hole in"
1539,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"it,"" said one of the children, in rather a pleased tone than otherwise;"
1540,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,then he turned the lunch all out on the grass and crammed it in the
1541,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"other pocket, hiding the basket behind a hedge."
1542,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1543,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I'm sure I'll not be at the trouble of carrying it,"" said he, when the"
1544,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"children cried out at this; ""and you shan't carry it either, for you'll"
1545,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,knock it about and spoil it. And as for your lunch getting warm in my
1546,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"pocket, why, so much the better this cold day."""
1547,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1548,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"It was not a lively joke, and they knew the pocket was very dirty;"
1549,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"indeed, the little girls had seen him stuff a dead rat into it only the"
1550,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"day before. They looked ready to cry; but there was no help for them,"
1551,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"except going back and complaining to their mother, and they did not like"
1552,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"to do that. Besides, they knew that, though Gardener was cross, he was"
1553,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"trustworthy, and she would never let them go down to the lake without"
1554,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,him.
1555,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1556,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"So they followed him, trying to be as good as they could--though it was"
1557,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"difficult work. One of them proposed pelting him with snowballs, as they"
1558,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,pelted each other. But at the first--which fell in his neck--he turned
1559,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"round so furiously, that they never sent a second, but walked behind him"
1560,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,as meek as mice.
1561,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1562,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"As they went, they heard little steps pattering after them."
1563,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1564,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Perhaps it is the Brownie to play with us--I wish he would,"" whispered"
1565,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"the youngest girl to the eldest boy, whose hand she generally held; and"
1566,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"then the little pattering steps sounded again, traveling through the"
1567,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"snow, but they saw nobody--so they said nothing."
1568,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1569,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,The children would have liked to go straight to the ice; but Gardener
1570,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"insisted on taking them a mile round, to look at an extraordinary animal"
1571,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,which a farmer there had just got--sent by his brother in Australia. The
1572,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,two old men stood gossiping so long that the children wearied
1573,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,extremely. Every minute seemed an hour till they got on the ice.
1574,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1575,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"At last one of them pulled Gardener's coat-tails, and whispered that"
1576,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,they were quite ready to go.
1577,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1578,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Then I'm not,"" and he waited ever so much longer, and got a drink of"
1579,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"hot cider, which made him quite lively for a little while."
1580,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1581,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But by the time they reached the lake, he was as cross as ever. He"
1582,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"struck the ice with his stick, but made no attempt to see if it really"
1583,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,did bear--though he would not allow the children to go one step upon it
1584,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,till he had tried.
1585,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1586,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I know it doesn't bear, and you'll just have to go home again--a good"
1587,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"thing too--saves me from losing a day's work."""
1588,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1589,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Try, only try; Bill said it bore,"" implored the boys, and looked"
1590,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"wistfully at the two beautiful slides--just as Bill said, one up and one"
1591,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"down--stretching all across the lake; ""of course it bears, or Bill could"
1592,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"not have made these slides."""
1593,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1594,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Bill's an ass!"" said the Gardener, and put his heavy foot cautiously on"
1595,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,the ice. Just then there was seen jumping across it a creature which
1596,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,certainly had never been seen on ice before. It made the most
1597,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"extraordinary bounds on its long hind legs, with its little fore legs"
1598,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"tucked up in front of it as if it wanted to carry a muff; and its long,"
1599,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"stiff tail sticking out straight behind, to balance it itself with"
1600,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"apparently. The children at first started with surprise, and then burst"
1601,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"out laughing, for it was the funniest creature, and had the funniest way"
1602,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"of getting along, that they had ever seen in their lives."
1603,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1604,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""It's the kangaroo!"" said Gardener, in great excitement. ""It has got"
1605,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,loose--and it's sure to be lost--and what a way Mr. Giles will be in! I
1606,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"must go and tell him. Or stop, I'll try and catch it."""
1607,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1608,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But in vain--it darted once or twice across the ice, dodging him, as it"
1609,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,were; and once coming so close that he nearly caught it by the tail--to
1610,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,the children's great delight--then it vanished entirely.
1611,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1612,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I must go and tell Mr. Giles directly,"" said Gardener, and then"
1613,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,stopped. For he had promised not to leave the children; and it was such
1614,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"a wild-goose chase, after an escaped kangaroo. But he might get half a"
1615,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"crown as a reward, and he was sure of another glass of cider."
1616,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1617,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""You just stop quiet here, and I'll be back in five minutes,"" said he to"
1618,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"the children. ""You may go a little way on the ice--I think it's sound"
1619,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"enough; only mind you don't tumble in, for there'll be nobody to pull"
1620,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"you out."""
1621,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1622,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Oh no,"" said the children, clapping their hands. They did not care for"
1623,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"tumbling in, and were quite glad there was nobody there to pull them"
1624,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"out. They hoped Gardener would stop a very long time away--only, as some"
1625,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"one suggested when he was seen hurrying across the snowy field, he had"
1626,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"taken away their lunch in his pocket, too."
1627,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1628,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Off they darted, the three elder boys, with a good run; the biggest of"
1629,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,the girls followed after them; and soon the whole four were skimming one
1630,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"after the other, as fast as a railway train, across the slippery ice."
1631,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"And, like a railway train, they had a collision, and all came tumbling"
1632,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"one over the other, with great screaming and laughing, to the high bank"
1633,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,on the other side. The two younger ones stood mournfully watching the
1634,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,others from the opposite bank--when there stood beside them a small
1635,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,brown man.
1636,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1637,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Ho-ho! little people,"" said he, coming between them and taking hold of"
1638,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"a hand of each. His was so warm and theirs so cold, that it was quite"
1639,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"comfortable. And then, somehow, they found in their mouths a nice"
1640,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"lozenge--I think it was peppermint, but am not sure; which comforted"
1641,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,them still more.
1642,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1643,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Did you want me to play with you?"" cried the Brownie; ""then here I am."
1644,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"What shall we do? Have a turn on the ice together?"""
1645,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1646,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,No sooner said than done. The two children felt themselves floating
1647,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,along--it was more like floating than running--with Brownie between
1648,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"them; up the lake, and down the lake, and across the lake, not at all"
1649,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"interfering with the sliders--indeed, it was a great deal better than"
1650,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"sliding. Rosy and breathless, their toes so nice and warm, and their"
1651,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,hands feeling like mince-pies just taken out of the oven--the little
1652,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,ones came to a standstill.
1653,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1654,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"The elder ones stopped their sliding, and looked toward Brownie with"
1655,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"entreating eyes. He swung himself up to a willow bough, and then turned"
1656,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,head over heels on to the ice.
1657,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1658,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Halloo! you don't mean to say you big ones want a race too! Well, come"
1659,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"along--if the two eldest will give a slide to the little ones."""
1660,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1661,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"He watched them take a tiny sister between them, and slide her up one"
1662,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"slide and down another, screaming with delight. Then he took the two"
1663,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,middle children in either hand.
1664,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1665,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""One, two, three, and away!"" Off they started--scudding along as light"
1666,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"as feathers and as fast as steam-engines, over the smooth, black ice, so"
1667,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,clear that they could see the bits of stick and water-grasses frozen in
1668,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"it, and even the little fishes swimming far down below--if they had only"
1669,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,looked long enough.
1670,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1671,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"When all had had their fair turns, they began to be frightfully hungry."
1672,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1673,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,[Illustration: The two little children felt themselves floating
1674,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,along--with Brownie between them--Page 64]
1675,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1676,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Catch a fish for dinner, and I'll lend you a hook,"" said Brownie. At"
1677,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"which they all laughed, and then looked rather grave. Pulling a cold,"
1678,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,raw live fish from under the ice and eating it was not a pleasant idea
1679,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"of dinner. ""Well, what would you like to have? Let the little one"
1680,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"choose."""
1681,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1682,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"She said, after thinking a minute, that she should like a currant-cake."
1683,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1684,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""And I'd give all you a bit of it--a very large bit--I would indeed!"""
1685,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"added she, almost with the tears in her eyes--she was so very hungry."
1686,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1687,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Do it, then!"" said the Brownie, in his little squeaking voice."
1688,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1689,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Immediately the stone that the little girl was sitting on--a round, hard"
1690,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"stone, and so cold!--turned into a nice hot cake--so hot that she jumped"
1691,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"up directly. As soon as she saw what it was, she clapped her hands for"
1692,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,joy.
1693,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1694,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful cake! only we haven't got a knife to"
1695,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"cut it."""
1696,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1697,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"The boys felt in all their pockets, but somehow their knives never were"
1698,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,there when they were wanted.
1699,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1700,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Look! you've got one in your hand!"" said Brownie to the little one; and"
1701,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"that minute a bit of stick she held turned into a bread-knife--silver,"
1702,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"with an ivory handle--big enough and sharp enough, without being too"
1703,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"sharp. For the youngest girl was not allowed to use sharp knives, though"
1704,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"she liked cutting things excessively, especially cakes."
1705,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1706,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""That will do. Sit you down and carve the dinner. Fair shares and don't"
1707,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"let any body eat too much. Now begin, ma'am,"" said the Brownie, quite"
1708,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"politely, as if she had been ever so old."
1709,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1710,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Oh, how proud the little girl was. How bravely she set to work, and cut"
1711,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"five of the biggest slices you ever saw, and gave them to her brothers"
1712,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"and sisters, and was just going to take the sixth slice for herself,"
1713,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,when she remembered the Brownie.
1714,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1715,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I beg your pardon,"" said she, as politely as he, though she was such a"
1716,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"very little girl, and turned round to the wee brown man. But he was"
1717,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,nowhere to be seen. The slices of cake in the children's hands remained
1718,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"cake, and uncommonly good it was, and such substantial eating that it"
1719,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,did nearly the same as dinner; but the cake itself turned suddenly to a
1720,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"stone again, and the knife into a bit of stick."
1721,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1722,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,For there was the Gardener coming clumping along by the bank of the
1723,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"lake, and growling as he went."
1724,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1725,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Have you got the kangaroo?"" shouted the children, determined to be"
1726,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"civil, if possible."
1727,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1728,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""This place is bewitched, I think,"" said he, ""The kangaroo was fast"
1729,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"asleep in the cow-shed. What! how dare you laugh at me?"""
1730,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1731,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But they hadn't laughed at all. And they found it no laughing matter,"
1732,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"poor children, when Gardener came on the ice, and began to scold them"
1733,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,and order them about. He was perfectly savage with crossness; for the
1734,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"people at Giles's Farm had laughed at him very much, and he did not like"
1735,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,to be laughed at--and at the top of the field he had by chance met his
1736,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"mistress, and she asked him severely how he could think of leaving the"
1737,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,children alone.
1738,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1739,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Altogether, his conscience pricked him a good deal, and when people's"
1740,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"consciences prick them, sometimes they get angry with other people,"
1741,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"which is very silly, and only makes matters worse."
1742,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1743,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""What have you been doing all this time?"" said he."
1744,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1745,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""All this five minutes?"" said the oldest boy, mischievously; for"
1746,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Gardener was only to be away five minutes, and he had staid a full"
1747,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"hour. Also, when he fumbled in his pocket for the children's lunch--to"
1748,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"stop their tongues, perhaps--he found it was not there."
1749,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1750,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"They set up a great outcry; for, in spite of the cake, they could have"
1751,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"eaten a little more. Indeed, the frost had such an effect upon all their"
1752,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"appetites, that they felt not unlike that celebrated gentleman of whom"
1753,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,it is told that
1754,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1755,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""He ate a cow, and ate a calf,"
1756,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"He ate an ox, and ate a half;"
1757,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"He ate a church, he ate the steeple,"
1758,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"He ate the priest, and all the people,"
1759,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"And said he hadn't had enough then."""
1760,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1761,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""We're so hungry, so very hungry! Couldn't you go back again and fetch"
1762,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"us some dinner?"" cried they, entreatingly."
1763,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1764,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Not I, indeed. You may go back to dinner yourselves. You shall, indeed,"
1765,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,for I want my dinner too. Two hours is plenty long enough to stop on the
1766,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"ice."""
1767,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1768,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""It isn't two hours--it's only one."""
1769,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1770,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Well, one will do better than more. You're all right now--and you might"
1771,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"soon tumble in, or break your legs on the slide. So come away home."""
1772,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1773,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"It wasn't kind of Gardener, and I don't wonder the children felt it"
1774,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"hard; indeed, the eldest boy resisted stoutly."
1775,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1776,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Mother said we might stop all day, and we will stop all day. You may go"
1777,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"home if you like."""
1778,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1779,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I won't, and you shall!"" said Gardener, smacking a whip that he carried"
1780,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"in his hand. ""Stop till I catch you, and I'll give you this about your"
1781,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"back, my fine gentleman."""
1782,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1783,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"And he tried to follow, but the little fellow darted across the ice,"
1784,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,objecting to be either caught or whipped. It may have been rather
1785,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"naughty, but I am afraid it was great fun dodging the Gardener up and"
1786,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"down; he being too timid to go on the slippery ice, and sometimes"
1787,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,getting so close that the whip nearly touched the lad.
1788,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1789,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Bless us! there's the kangaroo again!"" said he, starting. Just as he"
1790,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"had caught the boy, and lifted the whip, the creature was seen"
1791,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"hop-hopping from bank to bank. ""I can't surely be mistaken this time; I"
1792,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"must catch it."""
1793,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1794,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Which seemed quite easy, for it limped as if it was lame, or as if the"
1795,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"frost had bitten its toes, poor beast! Gardener went after it, walking"
1796,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"cautiously on the slippery, crackling ice, and never minding whether or"
1797,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"not he walked on the slides, though they called out to him that his"
1798,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,nailed boots would spoil them.
1799,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1800,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But whether it was that ice which bears a boy will not bear a man, or"
1801,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"whether at each lame step of the kangaroo there came a great crack, is"
1802,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"more than I can tell. However, just as Gardener reached the middle of"
1803,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"the lake, the ice suddenly broke, and in he popped.--The kangaroo too,"
1804,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"apparently, for it was not seen afterward."
1805,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1806,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,What a hullaballoo the poor man made! Not that he was drowning--the lake
1807,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"was too shallow to drown any body, but he got terribly wet, and the"
1808,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"water was very cold. He soon scrambled out, the boys helping him; and"
1809,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"then he hobbled home as fast as he could, not even saying thank you, or"
1810,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,taking the least notice of them.
1811,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1812,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"Indeed, nobody took notice of them--nobody came to fetch them, and they"
1813,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,might have staid sliding the whole afternoon. Only somehow they did not
1814,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,feel quite easy in their minds. And though the hole in the ice closed up
1815,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"immediately, and it seemed as firm as ever, still they did not like to"
1816,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,slide upon it again.
1817,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1818,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""I think we had better go home and tell mother every thing,"" said one of"
1819,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"them. ""Besides, we ought to see what has become of poor Gardener. He was"
1820,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"very wet."""
1821,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1822,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Yes, but oh, how funny he looked!"" And they all burst out laughing at"
1823,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"the recollection of the figure he cut, scrambling out through the ice"
1824,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"with his trowsers dripping up to the knees, and the water running out of"
1825,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"his boots, making a little pool, wherever he stepped."
1826,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1827,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""And it freezes so hard, that by the time he gets home his clothes will"
1828,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,be as stiff as a board. His wife will have to put him to the fire to
1829,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"thaw before he can get out of them."""
1830,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1831,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"[Illustration: The ice suddenly broke, and in he popped.]"
1832,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1833,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,Again the little people burst into shouts of laughter. Although they
1834,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"laughed, they were a little sorry for the poor old Gardener, and hoped"
1835,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"no great harm had come to him, but that he had got safe home and been"
1836,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,dried by his own warm fire.
1837,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1838,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"The frosty mist was beginning already to rise, and the sun, though still"
1839,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"high up in the sky, looked like a ball of red-hot iron as the six"
1840,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"children went homeward across the fields--merry enough still, but not"
1841,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,quite so merry as they had been a few hours before.
1842,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1843,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"""Let's hope mother won't be vexed with us,"" said they, ""but will let us"
1844,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,come back again to-morrow. It wasn't our fault that Gardener tumbled
1845,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"in."""
1846,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1847,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"As somebody said this, they all heard quite distinctly, ""Ha, ha, ha!"""
1848,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"and ""Ho, ho, ho!"" and a sound of little steps pattering behind."
1849,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,
1850,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,"But whatever they thought, nobody ventured to say that it was the fault"
1851,BROWNIE ON THE ICE,of the Brownie.

1866,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,say that any of his tricks will be the last. For there's no stopping a
1867,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Brownie, and no getting rid of him either. This one had followed the"
1868,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"family from house to house, generation after generation--never any"
1869,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"older, and sometimes seeming even to grow younger by the tricks he"
1870,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"played. In fact, though he looked like an old man, he was a perpetual"
1871,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,child.
1872,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1873,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"To the children he never did any harm, quite the contrary. And his chief"
1874,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,misdoings were against those who vexed the children. But he gradually
1875,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"made friends with several of his grown up enemies. Cook, for instance,"
1876,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"who had ceased to be lazy at night and late in the morning, found no"
1877,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,more black footmarks on her white table cloth. And Brownie found his
1878,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"basin of milk waiting for him, night after night, behind the coal-cellar"
1879,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,door.
1880,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1881,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Bill, too, got on well enough with his pony, and Jess was taken no more"
1882,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,night-rides. No ducks were lost; and Dolly gave her milk quite
1883,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,comfortably to whoever milked her. Alas! this was either Bill or the
1884,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Gardener's wife now. After that adventure on the ice, poor Gardener very"
1885,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"seldom appeared; when he did, it was on two crutches, for he had had"
1886,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"rheumatism in his feet, and could not stir outside his cottage door."
1887,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Bill, therefore, had double work; which was probably all the better for"
1888,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,Bill.
1889,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1890,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"The garden had to take care of itself; but this being winter-time, it"
1891,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"did not much signify. Besides, Brownie seldom went into the garden,"
1892,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,except in summer; during the hard weather he preferred to stop in his
1893,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"coal-cellar. It might not have been a lively place, but it was warm, and"
1894,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,he liked it.
1895,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1896,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"He had company there, too; for when the cat had more kittens--the kitten"
1897,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,he used to tease being grown up now--they were all put in a hamper in
1898,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the coal-cellar; and of cold nights Brownie used to jump in beside them,"
1899,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,and be as warm and as cozy as a kitten himself. The little things never
1900,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,were heard to mew; so it may be supposed they liked his society. And the
1901,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,old mother-cat evidently bore him no malice for the whipping she had got
1902,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,by mistake; so Brownie must have found means of coaxing her over. One
1903,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,thing you may be sure of--all the while she and her kittens were in his
1904,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"coal-cellar, he took care never to turn himself into a mouse."
1905,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1906,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"He was spending the winter, on the whole, very comfortably, without much"
1907,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"trouble either to himself or his neighbors, when one day, the"
1908,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"coal-cellar being nearly empty, two men, and a great wagon-load of coals"
1909,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"behind them, came to the door, Gardener's wife following."
1910,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1911,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""My man says you're to give the cellar a good cleaning out before you"
1912,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"put any more in,"" said she, in her sharp voice; ""and don't be lazy about"
1913,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"it. It'll not take you ten minutes, for it's nearly all coal-dust,"
1914,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"except that one big lump in the corner--you might clear that out too."""
1915,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1916,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Stop, it's the Brownie's lump! better not meddle with it,"" whispered"
1917,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,the little scullery-maid.
1918,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1919,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Don't you meddle with matters that can't concern you,"" said the"
1920,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Gardener's wife, who had been thinking what a nice help it would be to"
1921,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"her fire. To be sure, it was not her lump of coal, but she thought she"
1922,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"might take it; the mistress would never miss it, or the Brownie either."
1923,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,He must be a very silly old Brownie to live under a lump of coal.
1924,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1925,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"So she argued with herself, and made the men lift it. ""You must lift it,"
1926,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"you see, if you are to sweep the coal-cellar out clean. And you may as"
1927,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"well put it on the barrow, and I'll wheel it out of your way."""
1928,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1929,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"This she said in quite a civil voice, lest they should tell of her, and"
1930,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,stood by while it was being done. It was done without any thing
1931,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"happening, except that a large rat ran out of the coal-cellar door,"
1932,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"bouncing against her feet, and frightening her so much that she nearly"
1933,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,tumbled down.
1934,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1935,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""See what nonsense it is to talk of Brownies living in a coal-cellar."
1936,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Nothing lives there but rats, and I'll have them poisoned pretty soon,"
1937,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"and get rid of them."""
1938,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1939,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"But she was rather frightened all the same, for the rat had been such a"
1940,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"very big rat, and had looked at her, as it darted past, with such wild,"
1941,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"bright, mischievous eyes--brown eyes, of course--that she all but jumped"
1942,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,with surprise.
1943,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1944,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"However, she had got her lump of coal, and was wheeling it quietly away,"
1945,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"nobody seeing, to her cottage at the bottom of the garden. She was a"
1946,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"hard-worked woman, and her husband's illness made things harder for her."
1947,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Still, she was not quite easy at taking what did not belong to her."
1948,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1949,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""I don't suppose any body will miss the coal,"" she repeated. ""I dare say"
1950,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,the mistress would have given it to me if I had asked her; and as for
1951,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"its being the Brownie's lump--fudge! Bless us! what's that?"""
1952,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1953,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"For the barrow began to creak dreadfully, and every creak sounded like"
1954,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the cry of a child, just as if the wheel were going over its leg and"
1955,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,crushing its poor little bones.
1956,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1957,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""What a horrid noise! I must grease the barrow. If only I knew where"
1958,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"they keep the grease-box. All goes wrong, now my old man's laid up. Oh,"
1959,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"dear! oh dear!"""
1960,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1961,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"For suddenly the barrow had tilted over, though there was not a single"
1962,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"stone near, and the big coal was tumbled on to the ground, where it"
1963,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"broke into a thousand pieces. Gathering it up again was hopeless, and it"
1964,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"made such a mess on the gravel-walk, that the old woman was thankful her"
1965,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"misfortune happened behind the privet hedge, where nobody was likely to"
1966,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,come.
1967,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1968,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""I'll take a broom and sweep it up to-morrow. Nobody goes near the"
1969,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"orchard now, except me when I hang out the clothes; so I need say"
1970,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"nothing about it to the old man or any body. But ah! deary me, what a"
1971,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"beautiful lot of coal I've lost!"""
1972,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1973,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"She stood and looked at it mournfully, and then went into her cottage,"
1974,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,where she found two or three of the little children keeping Gardener
1975,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,company. They did not dislike to do this now; but he was so much kinder
1976,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"than he used to be--so quiet and patient, though he suffered very much."
1977,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,And he had never once reproached them for what they always
1978,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,remembered--how it was ever since he was on the ice with them that he
1979,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,had got the rheumatism.
1980,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1981,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,[Illustration: Suddenly the barrow had tilted over.]
1982,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1983,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"So, one or other of them made a point of going to see him every day, and"
1984,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"telling him all the funny things they could think of--indeed, it was a"
1985,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,contest among them who should first make Gardener laugh. They did not
1986,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,succeed in doing that exactly; but they managed to make him smile; and
1987,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,he was always gentle and grateful to them; so that they sometimes
1988,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,thought it was rather nice his being ill.
1989,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1990,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"But his wife was not pleasant; she grumbled all day long, and snapped at"
1991,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"him and his visitors; being especially snappish this day, because she"
1992,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,had lost her big coal.
1993,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1994,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""I can't have you children come bothering here,"" said she, crossly. ""I"
1995,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"want to wring out my clothes, and hang them to dry. Be off with you!"""
1996,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
1997,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Let us stop a little--just to tell Gardener this one curious thing"
1998,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,about Dolly and the pig--and then we'll help you to take your clothes to
1999,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the orchard; we can carry your basket between us--we can, indeed."""
2000,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2001,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,That was the last thing the woman wished; for she knew the that the
2002,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,children would be sure to see the mess on the gravel-walk--and they
2003,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,were such inquisitive children--they noticed every thing. They would
2004,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"want to know all about it, and how the bits of coal came there. It was"
2005,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,very a awkward position. But people who take other people's property
2006,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,often do find themselves in awkward positions.
2007,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2008,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Thank you, young gentlemen,"" said she, quite politely; ""but indeed the"
2009,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"basket is too heavy for you. However, you may stop and gossip a little"
2010,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"longer with my old man. He likes it."""
2011,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2012,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"And, while they were shut up with Gardener in his bedroom, off she went,"
2013,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"carrying the basket on her head, and hung her clothes carefully out--the"
2014,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"big things on lines between the fruit trees, and the little things, such"
2015,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"as stockings and pocket handkerchiefs, stuck on the gooseberry-bushes,"
2016,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,or spread upon the clean green grass.
2017,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2018,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Such a fine day as it is! they'll dry directly,"" said she, cheerfully,"
2019,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"to herself. ""Plenty of sun, and not a breath of wind to blow them about."
2020,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"I'll leave them for an hour or two, and come and fetch them in before it"
2021,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"grows dark. Then I shall get all my folding done by bedtime, and have a"
2022,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"clear day for ironing to-morrow."""
2023,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2024,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"But when she did fetch them in, having bundled them all together in the"
2025,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"dusk of the evening, never was such a sight as those clothes! They were"
2026,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"all twisted in the oddest way--the stockings turned inside out, with the"
2027,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,heels and toes tucked into the legs; the sleeves of the shirts tied
2028,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"together in double knots, the pocket-handkerchiefs made into round"
2029,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"balls, so tight that if you had pelted a person with them they would"
2030,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"have given very hard blows indeed. And the whole looked as if, instead"
2031,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"of lying quietly on the grass and bushes, they had been dragged through"
2032,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"heaps of mud and then stamped upon, so that there was not a clean inch"
2033,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,upon them from end to end.
2034,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2035,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""What a horrid mess!"" cried the Gardener's wife, who had been at first"
2036,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"very angry, and then very frightened. ""But I know what it is; that nasty"
2037,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Boxer has got loose again. It's he that has done it."""
2038,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2039,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Boxer wouldn't tie shirt-sleeves in double knots, or make balls of"
2040,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"pocket-handkerchiefs,"" Gardener was heard to answer, solemnly."
2041,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2042,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Then it's those horrid children; they are always up to some mischief or"
2043,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"other--just let me catch them!"""
2044,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2045,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""You'd better not,"" said somebody in a voice exactly like Gardener's,"
2046,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"though he himself declared he had not spoken a word. Indeed, he was fast"
2047,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,asleep.
2048,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2049,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Well, it's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of,"" the"
2050,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Gardener's wife said, supposing she was talking to her husband all the"
2051,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"time; but soon she held her tongue, for she found here and there among"
2052,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the clothes all sorts of queer marks--marks of fingers, and toes, and"
2053,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"heels, not in mud at all, but in coal-dust, as black as black could be."
2054,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2055,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Now, as the place where the big coal had tumbled out of the barrow was"
2056,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"fully fifty yards from the orchard, and, as the coal could not come to"
2057,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the clothes, and the clothes could not go without hands, the only"
2058,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"conclusion she could arrive at was--well, no particular conclusion at"
2059,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,all!
2060,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2061,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"It was too late that night to begin washing again; besides, she was"
2062,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"extremely tired, and her husband woke up rather worse than usual, so she"
2063,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"just bundled the clothes up anyhow in a corner, put the kitchen to"
2064,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"rights, and went mournfully to bed."
2065,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2066,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Next morning she got up long before it was light, washed her clothes"
2067,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"through all over again, and, it being impossible to dry them by the"
2068,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"fire, went out with them once more, and began spreading them out in"
2069,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"their usual corner, in a hopeless and melancholy manner. While she was"
2070,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"at it, the little folks came trooping around her. She didn't scold them"
2071,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"this time, she was too low-spirited."
2072,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2073,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""No! my old man isn't any better, and I don't fancy he ever will be,"""
2074,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"said she, in answer to their questions. ""And every thing's going wrong"
2075,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"with us--just listen!"" And she told the trick which had been played her"
2076,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,about the clothes.
2077,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2078,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"The little people tried not to laugh, but it was so funny; and even now,"
2079,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the minute she had done hanging them out, there was something so droll"
2080,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"in the way the clothes blew about, without any wind; the shirts hanging"
2081,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"with their necks downward, as if there was a man inside them; and the"
2082,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"drawers standing stiffly astride on the gooseberry-bushes, for all the"
2083,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,world as if they held a pair of legs still. As for Gardener's
2084,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"night-caps--long, white cotton, with a tassel at the top--they were"
2085,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,alarming to look at; just like a head stuck on the top of a pole.
2086,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2087,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"The whole thing was so peculiar, and the old woman so comical in her"
2088,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"despair, that the children, after trying hard to keep it in, at last"
2089,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,broke into shouts of laughter. She turned furiously upon them.
2090,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2091,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""It was you who did it!"""
2092,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2093,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""No, indeed it wasn't!"" said they, jumping farther to escape her blows."
2094,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"For she had got one of her clothes-props, and was laying about her in"
2095,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the most reckless manner. However, she hurt nobody, and then she"
2096,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"suddenly burst out, not laughing, but crying."
2097,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2098,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""It's a cruel thing, whoever has done it, to play such tricks on a poor"
2099,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"old body like me, with a sick husband that she works hard for, and not a"
2100,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"child to help her. But I don't care. I'll wash my clothes again, if it's"
2101,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"twenty times over, and I'll hang them out again in the very place, just"
2102,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"to make you all ashamed of yourselves."""
2103,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2104,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Perhaps the little people were ashamed of themselves, though they really"
2105,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"had not done the mischief. But they knew quite well who had done it, and"
2106,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"more than once they were about to tell; only they were afraid, if they"
2107,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"did so, they should vex the Brownie so much that he would never come and"
2108,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,play with them any more.
2109,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2110,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"So they looked at one another without speaking, and when the Gardener's"
2111,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"wife had emptied her basket and dried her eyes, they said to her, very"
2112,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,kindly:
2113,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2114,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Perhaps no harm may come to your clothes this time. We'll sit and watch"
2115,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"them till they are dry."""
2116,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2117,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Just as you like; I don't care. Them that hides can find, and them that"
2118,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"plays tricks knows how to stop 'em."""
2119,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2120,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"It was not a civil speech, but then things were hard for the poor old"
2121,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"woman. She had been awake nearly all night, and up washing at daybreak;"
2122,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"her eyes were red with crying, and her steps weary and slow. The little"
2123,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"children felt quite sorry for her, and, instead of going to play, sat"
2124,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,watching the clothes as patiently as possible.
2125,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2126,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"Nothing came near them. Sometimes, as before, the things seemed to dance"
2127,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"about without hands, and turn into odd shapes, as if there were people"
2128,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,inside them; but not a creature was seen and not a sound was heard. And
2129,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"though there was neither wind nor sun, very soon all the linen was"
2130,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,perfectly dry.
2131,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2132,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Fetch one of mother's baskets, and we'll fold it up as tidily as"
2133,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"possible--that is, the girls can do it, it's their business--and we boys"
2134,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"will carry it safe to Gardener's cottage."""
2135,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2136,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"So said they, not liking to say that they could not trust it out of"
2137,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"their sight for fear of Brownie, whom, indeed, they were expecting to"
2138,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,see peer round from every bush. They began to have a secret fear that
2139,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"he was rather a naughty Brownie; but then, as the eldest little girl"
2140,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"whispered, ""He was only a Brownie, and knew no better."" Now they were"
2141,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"growing quite big children, who would be men and women some time; when"
2142,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,they hoped they would never do any thing wrong. (Their parents hoped the
2143,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"same, but doubted it.)"
2144,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2145,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"In a serious and careful manner they folded up the clothes, and laid"
2146,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"them one by one in the basket without any mischief, until, just as the"
2147,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"two biggest boys were lifting their burden to carry it away, they felt"
2148,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,something tugging at it from underneath.
2149,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2150,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Halloo! Where are you taking all this rubbish? Better give it to me."""
2151,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2152,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""No, if you please,"" said they, very civilly, not to offend the little"
2153,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"brown man. ""We'll not trouble you, thanks! We'd rather do it ourselves;"
2154,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"for poor Gardener is very ill, and his wife is very miserable, and we"
2155,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"are extremely sorry for them both."""
2156,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2157,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Extremely sorry!"" cried Brownie, throwing up his cap in the air, and"
2158,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"tumbling head over heels in an excited manner. ""What in the world does"
2159,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"extremely sorry mean?"""
2160,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2161,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"The children could not explain, especially to a Brownie; but they"
2162,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"thought they understood--anyhow, they felt it. And they looked so"
2163,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,sorrowful that the Brownie could not tell what to make of it.
2164,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2165,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"He could not be said to be sorry, since, being a Brownie, and not a"
2166,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"human being, knowing right from wrong, he never tried particularly to do"
2167,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"right, and had no idea that he was doing wrong. But he seemed to have an"
2168,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"idea that he was troubling the children, and he never liked to see them"
2169,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,look unhappy.
2170,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2171,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"So he turned head over heels six times running, and then came back"
2172,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,again.

2174,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""The silly old woman! I washed her clothes for her last night in a way"
2175,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"she didn't expect. I hadn't any soap, so I used a little mud and"

2178,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,

2184,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"that they stood and stared in the utmost amazement, and quite forgot the"

2186,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2187,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Seek till you find, seek till you find,"

2190,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"They heard him singing this remarkable rhyme, long after they had lost"
2191,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,sight of him. And then they all set about searching; but it was a long
2192,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"while before they found, and still longer before they could decide,"
2193,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"which was the biggest gooseberry-bush, each child having his or her"
2194,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,opinion--sometimes a very strong one--on the matter. At last they agreed
2195,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"to settle it by pulling half-a-dozen little sticks, to see which stick"
2196,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"was the longest, and the child that held it was to decide the"
2197,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,gooseberry-bush.
2198,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2199,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"This done, underneath the branches what should they find but the"
2200,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"identical basket of clothes! only, instead of being roughly dried, they"
2201,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,were all starched and ironed in the most beautiful manner. As for the
2202,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"shirts, they really were a picture to behold, and the stockings were all"
2203,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"folded up, and even darned in one or two places, as neatly as possible."
2204,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"And strange to tell, there was not a single black mark of feet or"

2206,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2207,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"""Kind little Brownie! clever little Brownie!"" cried the children in"
2208,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"chorus, and thought this was the most astonishing trick he had ever"
2209,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,played.
2210,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2211,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"What the Gardener's wife said about it, whether they told her any thing,"
2212,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,or allowed her to suppose that the clothes had been done in their own
2213,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"laundry instead of the Brownie's (wherever that establishment might be),"
2214,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,is more than I can tell. Of one thing only I am certain--that the little
2215,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"people said nothing but what was true. Also, that the very minute they"
2216,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,got home they told their mother every thing.
2217,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2218,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,But for a long time after that they were a good deal troubled. Gardener
2219,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"got better, and went hobbling about the place again, to his own and"
2220,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"every body's great content, and his wife was less sharp-tongued and"
2221,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"complaining than usual--indeed, she had nothing to complain of. All the"
2222,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"family were very flourishing, except the little Brownie."
2223,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2224,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,Often there was heard a curious sound all over the house; it might have
2225,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,been rats squeaking behind the wainscot--the elders said it was--but the
2226,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,children were sure it was a sort of weeping and wailing.

2234,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2235,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"A most forlorn tune it was, ending in a dreary minor key, and it lasted"
2236,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,for months and months--at least the children said it did. And they were
2237,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"growing quite dull for want of a playfellow, when, by the greatest good"
2238,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"luck in the world, there came to the house not only a new lot of"
2239,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"kittens, but a new baby. And the new baby was everybody's pet, including"
2240,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,the Brownie's.

2242,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,[Illustration: The new baby was everybody's pet.--Page 87]
2243,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2244,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"From that time, though he was not often seen, he was continually heard"
2245,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"up and down the staircase, where he was frequently mistaken for Tiny or"
2246,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"the cat, and sent sharply down again, which was wasting a great deal of"
2247,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,wholesome anger upon Mr. Nobody. Or he lurked in odd corners of the
2248,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"nursery, whither the baby was seen crawling eagerly after nothing in"
2249,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"particular, or sitting laughing with all her might at something--probably"
2250,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,her own toes.
2251,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2252,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"But, as Brownie was never seen, he was never suspected. And since he did"
2253,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"no mischief--neither pinched the baby nor broke the toys, left no soap"
2254,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,in the bath and no footmarks about the room--but was always a
2255,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"well-conducted Brownie in every way, he was allowed to inhabit the"
2256,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"nursery (or supposed to do so, since, as nobody saw him, nobody could"

2258,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,
2259,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"After that he retired into his coal-cellar, and, for all I know, he may"
2260,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"live there still, and have gone through hundreds of adventures since;"
2261,BROWNIE AND THE CLOTHES,"but as I never heard them, I can't tell them. Only I think, if I could"

2273,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2274,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,A SLENDER young Blackbird built in a thorn-tree
2275,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,A spruce little fellow as ever could be;
2276,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"His bill was so yellow, his feathers so black,"
2277,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"So long was his tail, and so glossy his back,"
2278,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"That good Mrs. B., who sat hatching her eggs,"
2279,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And only just left them to stretch her poor legs,"
2280,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And pick for a minute the worm she preferred,"
2281,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Thought there never was seen such a beautiful bird.
2282,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2283,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,And such a kind husband! how early and late
2284,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"He would sit at the top of the old garden gate,"
2285,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And sing, just as merry as if it were June,"
2286,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Being ne'er out of patience, or temper, or tune."
2287,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""So unlike those Rooks, dear; from morning till night"
2288,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"They seem to do nothing but quarrel and fight,"
2289,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And wrangle and jangle, and plunder--while we"
2290,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Sit, honest and safe, in our pretty thorn-tree."""
2291,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2292,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Just while she was speaking, a lively young Rook"
2293,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Alit with a flap that the thorn-bush quite shook,"
2294,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And seizing a stick from the nest--""Come, I say,"
2295,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"That will just suit me, neighbor""--flew with it away"
2296,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,The lady loud twittered--her husband soon heard:
2297,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Though peaceful, he was not a cowardly bird;"
2298,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,And with arguments angry enough to o'erwhelm
2299,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,A whole Rookery--flew to the top of the elm.
2300,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2301,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""How dare you, you--"" (thief he was going to say;"
2302,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,But a civiller sentiment came in the way:
2303,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"For he knew 'tis no good, and it anyhow shames"
2304,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"A gentleman, calling strange gentlemen names:)"
2305,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""Pray what is your motive, Sir Rook, for such tricks,"

2308,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,At which the whole colony set up a--caw!

2311,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""I've built my small nest with much labor and pain."
2312,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"I'm a poor singing gentleman, Sirs, it is true,"
2313,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Though cockneys do often mistake me for you;
2314,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"But I keep Mrs. Blackbird, and four little eggs,"

2321,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"At least, not at first: for it must be confessed"
2322,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Poor Blackbird lost many a stick from his nest;
2323,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And his unkind grand neighbors with scoffing caw-caws,"
2324,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"In his voice and his character found many flaws,"
2325,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And jeered him and mocked him; but when they'd all done,"
2326,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,He flew to his tree and sang cheerily on.
2327,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2328,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,At length May arrived with her garlands of leaves;
2329,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"The swallows were building beneath the farm-eaves,"
2330,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Wrens, linnets, and sparrows, on every hedge-side,"
2331,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Were bringing their families out with great pride;

2333,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"With a flutter and clamor that never did stop,"
2334,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"The haughty old Rooks held their heads up so high,"
2335,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,And dreamed not of trouble--until it drew nigh!
2336,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2337,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"One morning at seven, as he came with delight"
2338,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"To his wife's pretty parlor of may-blossoms white,"
2339,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Having fed all his family ere rise of sun,--"
2340,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Mr. Blackbird perceived--a big man with a gun;
2341,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Who also perceived him: ""See, Charlie, among"
2342,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"That may, sits the Blackbird we've heard for so long:"
2343,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,Most likely his nest's there--how frightened he looks!

2345,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2346,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,I don't say 'twas cruel--I can't say 'twas kind--
2347,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,On the subject I haven't quite made up my mind:
2348,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"But those guns went pop-popping all morning, alas!"
2349,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And young Rooks kept dropping among the long grass,"
2350,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"Till good Mr. Blackbird, who watched the whole thing,"
2351,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"For pity could scarcely a single note sing,"
2352,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,And in the May sunset he hardly could bear
2353,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,To hear the returning Rooks' caw of despair.
2354,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,
2355,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""O, dear Mrs. Blackbird,"" at last warbled he,"
2356,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""How happy we are in our humble thorn-tree;"

2359,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"""And then our dear children,"" the mother replied,"
2360,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And she nested them close to her warm feathered side,"
2361,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,"And with a soft twitter of drowsy content,"
2362,THE BLACKBIRD AND THE ROOKS.,In the quiet May moonlight to sleep they all went.

3293,DICK AND I,"The best, grandest party we ever did try:"
3294,DICK AND I,And I'm very happy--but Dick is so shy!
3295,DICK AND I,
3296,DICK AND I,"I've got a white ball-dress, and flowers in my hair,"
3297,DICK AND I,"And a scarf, with a brooch too, mamma let me wear:"
3298,DICK AND I,"Silk stockings, and shoes with high heels, I declare!"
3299,DICK AND I,
3300,DICK AND I,There is to be music--a real soldier's band:
3301,DICK AND I,"And _I_ mean to waltz, and eat ice, and be fanned,"
3302,DICK AND I,"Like a grown-up young lady, the first in the land."
3303,DICK AND I,
3304,DICK AND I,"But Dick is so stupid, so silent and shy:"
3305,DICK AND I,"Has never learnt dancing, so says he won't try--"
3306,DICK AND I,Yet Dick is both older and wiser than I.
3307,DICK AND I,
3308,DICK AND I,And I'm fond of my brother--this darling old Dick:
3309,DICK AND I,"I'll hunt him in corners wherever he stick,"
3310,DICK AND I,He's bad at a party--but at school he's a brick!
3311,DICK AND I,
3312,DICK AND I,"So good at his Latin, at cricket, football,"
3313,DICK AND I,Whatever he tries at. And then he's so tall!
3314,DICK AND I,Yet at play with the children he's best of us all.
3315,DICK AND I,
3316,DICK AND I,"And his going to the party is just to please _me_,"
3317,DICK AND I,Poor Dick! so good-natured. How dull he will be!
3318,DICK AND I,"But he says I shall dance ""like a wave o' the sea."""
3319,DICK AND I,
3320,DICK AND I,"That's Shakespeare, his Shakespeare, he worships him so."
3321,DICK AND I,"Our Dick he writes poems, though none will he show;"
3322,DICK AND I,"I found out his secret, but I won't tell: no, no."
3323,DICK AND I,
3324,DICK AND I,"And when he's a great man, a poet you see,"
3325,DICK AND I,O dear! what a proud little sister I'll be;

3338,GRANDPAPA,"Grandpapa once lived in one little room,"
3339,GRANDPAPA,Grandpapa worked all day long at his loom:
3340,GRANDPAPA,"He speaks with queer accent, does dear grandpapa,"
3341,GRANDPAPA,And not half so well as papa and mamma.
3342,GRANDPAPA,"The girls think his clothes are a little rough,"
3343,GRANDPAPA,But the boys all declare they can't love him enough.
3344,GRANDPAPA,
3345,GRANDPAPA,"A man of the people in manners and mind,"

3347,GRANDPAPA,"Makes the best of his lot still, where'er it be cast."
3348,GRANDPAPA,"A sturdy old Englishman, game to the last."
