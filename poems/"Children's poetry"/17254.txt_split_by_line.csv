42,BOOK,
43,BOOK,Where Bobby lives there is a hill--
44,BOOK,"A hill so steep and high,"
45,BOOK,'Twould fill the bill for Jack and Jill
46,BOOK,Their famous act to try
47,BOOK,
48,BOOK,Once Bobby's Go-cart broke away
49,BOOK,And down this hill it kited.
50,BOOK,The careless Nurse screamed in dismay
51,BOOK,But Bobby was delighted
52,BOOK,
53,BOOK,"He clapped his hands, in manner rude,"
54,BOOK,And laughed in high elation--
55,BOOK,"While, close behind, the Nurse pursued"
56,BOOK,In hopeless consternation
57,BOOK,
58,BOOK,[Illustration]
59,BOOK,
60,BOOK,An Officer slid off the lid
61,BOOK,"As Bobby hove in sight,"
62,BOOK,"And bellowed out, ""You're scorchin', kid--"
63,BOOK,"I'll run you in all right!"""
64,BOOK,
65,BOOK,But down the Go-cart swiftly sped
66,BOOK,"And smashed that Cop completely,"
67,BOOK,And as he sailed o'er Bobby's head
68,BOOK,Bob snipped a button neatly!
69,BOOK,
70,BOOK,[Illustration]
71,BOOK,
72,BOOK,A funny Son of sunny Greece
73,BOOK,"Was standing near the curb,"
74,BOOK,"Beside his push-cart, wrapped in peace,"
75,BOOK,That naught could well disturb
76,BOOK,
77,BOOK,But all at once he got a shock--
78,BOOK,"The Go-cart speeding down,"
79,BOOK,Collided with his fancy stock
80,BOOK,And littered up the town!
81,BOOK,
82,BOOK,[Illustration]
83,BOOK,
84,BOOK,The runaway then swerved a bit
85,BOOK,"And snapped a Hydrant, short;"
86,BOOK,Which accident proved quite a hit
87,BOOK,Of rather novel sort
88,BOOK,
89,BOOK,The Water spouted in a jet
90,BOOK,"As much as ten feet high,"
91,BOOK,And all were soaked and nearly choked
92,BOOK,Who chanced to be nearby!
93,BOOK,
94,BOOK,[Illustration]
95,BOOK,
96,BOOK,"A farmer's wife, Miss' Angy Moore,"
97,BOOK,Was trudging up the grade.
98,BOOK,A basketful of eggs she bore
99,BOOK,To barter with in trade
100,BOOK,
101,BOOK,The Go-cart and the Lady met
102,BOOK,"(Informally, no doubt)"
103,BOOK,And made a sort of omelette
104,BOOK,And spread it round about!
105,BOOK,
106,BOOK,[Illustration]
107,BOOK,
108,BOOK,"A Painter on a ladder perched,"
109,BOOK,Was working at his calling--
110,BOOK,Against its foot the Go-cart lurched
111,BOOK,And sent the fellow sprawling
112,BOOK,
113,BOOK,His pot of paint came tumbling down
114,BOOK,"And wrong side up, it settled"
115,BOOK,About a Chappie's flaxen crown--
116,BOOK,"Oh, my! but he was nettled!"
117,BOOK,
118,BOOK,[Illustration]
119,BOOK,
120,BOOK,A German Band across the street
121,BOOK,"Its way was slowly wending,"
122,BOOK,"Which was a movement indiscreet,"
123,BOOK,The way that things were tending
124,BOOK,
125,BOOK,"The Go-cart struck the bass drum square,"
126,BOOK,And passed completely through it.
127,BOOK,The Drummer madly tore his hair
128,BOOK,"And said, ""Vy did you do it?"""
129,BOOK,
130,BOOK,[Illustration]
131,BOOK,
132,BOOK,Some Workingmen were putting in
133,BOOK,A heavy plate-glass front.
134,BOOK,The Go-cart then came rushing in
135,BOOK,And did its little stunt
136,BOOK,
137,BOOK,It smashed to bits a crystal pane
138,BOOK,"Two sweating men were bearing,"
139,BOOK,And sped on down the slanting plane
140,BOOK,And left them mad and swearing!
141,BOOK,
142,BOOK,[Illustration]
143,BOOK,
144,BOOK,An automobile big and brown
145,BOOK,"Was chugging up the hill,"
146,BOOK,And met the Go-cart plunging down
147,BOOK,With speed that boded ill
148,BOOK,
149,BOOK,At once there rose a noise and din
150,BOOK,Of people in dismay.
151,BOOK,A Sandwich-man then butted in
152,BOOK,And opened up a way!
153,BOOK,
154,BOOK,[Illustration]
155,BOOK,
156,BOOK,A Lad was rushing with a Hat
157,BOOK,Some Lady had been buying--
158,BOOK,"The Go-cart caught--and laid him flat,"
159,BOOK,And sent the hat-box flying
160,BOOK,
161,BOOK,The Hat fell out and settled down
162,BOOK,Upon our Bobby's head.
163,BOOK,"""Say, I'm the swellest kid in town!"""
164,BOOK,The precious rascal said
165,BOOK,
166,BOOK,[Illustration]
167,BOOK,
168,BOOK,A Newsboy next was somehow hit--
169,BOOK,"The Go-cart, swift and dextrous,"
170,BOOK,Contrived to muss him up a bit
171,BOOK,And fill the air with extras
172,BOOK,
173,BOOK,"One copy Bobby neatly scooped,"
174,BOOK,"And saw this wild display,"
175,BOOK,In type so bold it fairly whooped:
