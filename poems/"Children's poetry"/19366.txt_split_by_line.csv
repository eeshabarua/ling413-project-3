42,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Punky Dunk on a day in the middle of May
43,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Looked around like a wise little cat,"
44,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And he said with surprise: ""Can I trust my own eyes?"
45,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Well, what do you know about that?"""
46,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
47,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
48,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
49,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"For a wagon of blue, with a man in blue, too,"
50,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,At the sidewalk was just backing up.
51,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And the man brought a crate that was heavy of weight
52,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And inside was a gay spotted pup.
53,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
54,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
55,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
56,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Now Punky felt hurt as he gazed very pert
57,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"At the gay spotted pup in the box,"
58,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"For the pup was all white, save for spots black as night"
59,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"On his back and his tail, ears and sox."
60,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
61,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
62,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
63,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""Meow!"" said the cat, ""That pup is too fat"
64,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,To run or to climb up a tree.
65,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,The baby won't like that gay spotted tike
66,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"As well as I know he likes me."""
67,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
68,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
69,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
70,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Punky said: ""He may run, but he won't be much fun,"
71,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"He may set, or may bark, or may point."""
72,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"You see, Punky's heart was beginning to smart"
73,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And his nose was put clear out of joint.
74,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
75,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
76,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
77,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"The pup was let out, and he ran all about"
78,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,So happy was he to be free.
79,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Then Punky said: ""Meow!"" the dog said: ""Bow-wow!"""
80,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And Punky said: ""Look out for me!"""
81,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
82,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
83,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
84,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,He raised up his hair and tried hard to scare
85,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"The pup, so he would run away,"
86,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,But the pup shook his head and in dog talk he said:
87,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""No, Punky, I've come here to stay."""
88,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
89,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
90,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
91,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Then Punky, quite rash, at the pup made a dash,"
92,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,But the pup stood his ground very bold.
93,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And Punky then stopped so quick that he dropped
94,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And over and over he rolled.
95,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
96,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
97,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
98,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Then the pup with a bark started in for a lark
99,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"But Punky thought he meant to fight,"
100,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And he ran up a tree just as fast as could be
101,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And he stayed there until it was night.
102,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
103,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
104,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
105,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Punky Dunk has made up with the gay spotted pup
106,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And with Baby they play every day.
107,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Don't you think, little friends, that this little tale ends"
108,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,In the very best kind of way?
