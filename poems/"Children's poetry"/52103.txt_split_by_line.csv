157,AND HIS CAT.,
158,AND HIS CAT.,"God prosper long our good Lord Mayor,"
159,AND HIS CAT.,And give him wealth and wit!
160,AND HIS CAT.,A little wisdom too mote well
161,AND HIS CAT.,His judgement-seat befit.
162,AND HIS CAT.,
163,AND HIS CAT.,"Come listen all ye prentice lads,"
164,AND HIS CAT.,"Sore set to drudge and fast,"
165,AND HIS CAT.,How that good luck and industrie
166,AND HIS CAT.,Will make a man at last.
167,AND HIS CAT.,
168,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: Whittington,]"
169,AND HIS CAT.,
170,AND HIS CAT.,"When our third Edward ruled the land,"
171,AND HIS CAT.,"A king of glorious fame,"
172,AND HIS CAT.,"An humble boy there lived also,"
173,AND HIS CAT.,Dick Whittington by name.
174,AND HIS CAT.,
175,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: an orphan boy,]"
176,AND HIS CAT.,
177,AND HIS CAT.,His father and his mother too
178,AND HIS CAT.,Were laid beneath the sod:
179,AND HIS CAT.,"But he was left, and all alone"
180,AND HIS CAT.,The path of misery trod.
181,AND HIS CAT.,
182,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: destitute,]"
183,AND HIS CAT.,
184,AND HIS CAT.,"No woollen hose wore he, nor shoes"
185,AND HIS CAT.,Upon his shivering feet;
186,AND HIS CAT.,A tatter’d cloak was all he had
187,AND HIS CAT.,To ward the rain and sleet.
188,AND HIS CAT.,
189,AND HIS CAT.,"Yet, though his breast was cold without,"
190,AND HIS CAT.,His heart was warm within;
191,AND HIS CAT.,"And he grumbled not, for well he wot"
192,AND HIS CAT.,That envy is a sin.
193,AND HIS CAT.,
194,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: but industrious,]"
195,AND HIS CAT.,
196,AND HIS CAT.,And he would fight with all his might
197,AND HIS CAT.,To earn his daily bread:
198,AND HIS CAT.,"Alas, to think how oft he went"
199,AND HIS CAT.,All supperless to bed!
200,AND HIS CAT.,
201,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: had heard great reports of London.]
202,AND HIS CAT.,
203,AND HIS CAT.,"Now he had heard of London town,"
204,AND HIS CAT.,And what the folks did there:
205,AND HIS CAT.,"How aldermen did eat and drink,"
206,AND HIS CAT.,And plenty had to spare.
207,AND HIS CAT.,
208,AND HIS CAT.,"And how the streets were full of shops,"
209,AND HIS CAT.,And shops were full of food;
210,AND HIS CAT.,"Of beef, and mutton, cheese and ham,"
211,AND HIS CAT.,And every thing that’s good.
212,AND HIS CAT.,
213,AND HIS CAT.,And how the men and women all
214,AND HIS CAT.,Were lords and ladies there;
215,AND HIS CAT.,And little boys were rigg’d as smart
216,AND HIS CAT.,As monkeys at a fair.
217,AND HIS CAT.,
218,AND HIS CAT.,"But what most wonderful did seem,"
219,AND HIS CAT.,"Of all he had heard told,"
220,AND HIS CAT.,Was how the streets of that great town
221,AND HIS CAT.,Were paved with solid gold.
222,AND HIS CAT.,
223,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: Resolved to get there,]"
224,AND HIS CAT.,
225,AND HIS CAT.,"Heyday! thought he, if only I"
226,AND HIS CAT.,Could get to that fine place!
227,AND HIS CAT.,’Twould not be long ere I would change
228,AND HIS CAT.,My miserable case.
229,AND HIS CAT.,
230,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: he makes his way on foot.]
231,AND HIS CAT.,
232,AND HIS CAT.,Now started off for London town
233,AND HIS CAT.,"Before the break of day,"
234,AND HIS CAT.,He fared beside a waggoner
235,AND HIS CAT.,Who drove his team that way.
236,AND HIS CAT.,
237,AND HIS CAT.,All day they trudged until the sun
238,AND HIS CAT.,Had sunk behind the hill;
239,AND HIS CAT.,And when he rose again next morn
240,AND HIS CAT.,He saw them trudging still.
241,AND HIS CAT.,
242,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: His joy to behold that land of plenty.]
243,AND HIS CAT.,
244,AND HIS CAT.,At length a multitudinous smoke
245,AND HIS CAT.,Hid half th’ horizon round:
246,AND HIS CAT.,And such a sight of chimney-pots!
247,AND HIS CAT.,Dick gaped with joy and stound.
248,AND HIS CAT.,
249,AND HIS CAT.,He thought how often he had lain
250,AND HIS CAT.,Beneath the cold damp air;
251,AND HIS CAT.,"While here was house-room sure for all,"
252,AND HIS CAT.,And fires i’faith to spare.
253,AND HIS CAT.,
254,AND HIS CAT.,’Twere hard indeed if one should need
255,AND HIS CAT.,A chimney-corner here:
256,AND HIS CAT.,And from the drays that block’d the ways
257,AND HIS CAT.,Small lack could be of beer.
258,AND HIS CAT.,
259,AND HIS CAT.,"’Twas thus thought Dick, and so full quick"
260,AND HIS CAT.,The waggoner he left;
261,AND HIS CAT.,"And was not long, ere thro’ the throng"
262,AND HIS CAT.,His nimble way he cleft.
263,AND HIS CAT.,
264,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: His subsequent disappointment;]
265,AND HIS CAT.,
266,AND HIS CAT.,"Thro’ street, thro’ lane, full fast he ran;"
267,AND HIS CAT.,But marvell’d to behold
268,AND HIS CAT.,"The ways all strown with dirt and stone,"
269,AND HIS CAT.,And not with solid gold.
270,AND HIS CAT.,
271,AND HIS CAT.,"And folks were not all lords he thought,"
272,AND HIS CAT.,Nor ladies of degree:
273,AND HIS CAT.,"For here were rags, and here were tags,"
274,AND HIS CAT.,As in his own countrie.
275,AND HIS CAT.,
276,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: when hungry and cold,]"
277,AND HIS CAT.,
278,AND HIS CAT.,"Yet, where such plenty seem’d of all"
279,AND HIS CAT.,"A hungry lad mote need,"
280,AND HIS CAT.,Tho’ rags were there he did not care:
281,AND HIS CAT.,He could not fail to speed.
282,AND HIS CAT.,
283,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: he is neither fed by the victualler;]
284,AND HIS CAT.,
285,AND HIS CAT.,So at a shop he made a stop:
286,AND HIS CAT.,Before his well-spread board
287,AND HIS CAT.,"The vict’ller stood, in jolly mood;"
288,AND HIS CAT.,Dick thought he was a lord.
289,AND HIS CAT.,
290,AND HIS CAT.,In cap ydight and waistcoat white
291,AND HIS CAT.,He beckon’d folks within;
292,AND HIS CAT.,While fumes arose to tell the nose
293,AND HIS CAT.,Of all that savoury bin.
294,AND HIS CAT.,
295,AND HIS CAT.,Dick’s joy was great to see the meat;
296,AND HIS CAT.,So in he ran with haste:
297,AND HIS CAT.,Alas! roast beef is nought but grief
298,AND HIS CAT.,To such as may not taste.
299,AND HIS CAT.,
300,AND HIS CAT.,The vict’ller’s eye right scornfully
301,AND HIS CAT.,Scann’d Dick from foot to head;
302,AND HIS CAT.,"Who begg’d, for love of God above,"
303,AND HIS CAT.,A bit of meat and bread.
304,AND HIS CAT.,
305,AND HIS CAT.,“For one small groat it may be bought;
306,AND HIS CAT.,“I’faith it is not dear:
307,AND HIS CAT.,"“But no sirloin withouten coin,"
308,AND HIS CAT.,“Nor room for beggars here.”
309,AND HIS CAT.,
310,AND HIS CAT.,Thereat a pamper’d cur rush’d forth
311,AND HIS CAT.,And bit Dick’s naked feet:
312,AND HIS CAT.,Who by the wrathful victualler
313,AND HIS CAT.,Was shoved into the street.
314,AND HIS CAT.,
315,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: nor covered by the clothier;]
316,AND HIS CAT.,
317,AND HIS CAT.,Next shivering in his tatter’d dress
318,AND HIS CAT.,He view’d a clothier’s store;
319,AND HIS CAT.,"But, as he was all penniless,"
320,AND HIS CAT.,They drove him from the door.
321,AND HIS CAT.,
322,AND HIS CAT.,"Ah, tradesmen sleek! ah, Christians meek!"
323,AND HIS CAT.,"Why will ye swell with pride,"
324,AND HIS CAT.,When ragged want or wretched woe
325,AND HIS CAT.,Stands shivering at your side?
326,AND HIS CAT.,
327,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: nor even heeded by any body.]
328,AND HIS CAT.,
329,AND HIS CAT.,"Alas, poor boy! what could he do?"
330,AND HIS CAT.,The busy crowd swept past:
331,AND HIS CAT.,"But all on self intent, or pelf,"
332,AND HIS CAT.,No eye on him was cast.
333,AND HIS CAT.,
334,AND HIS CAT.,"He strove to beg: some heard him not,"
335,AND HIS CAT.,And some would not believe:
336,AND HIS CAT.,"Some heard him and believed him too,"
337,AND HIS CAT.,But yet would not relieve.
338,AND HIS CAT.,
339,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: Want most grievous in the midst of plenty.]
340,AND HIS CAT.,
341,AND HIS CAT.,"Oh! hunger is a galling thing,"
342,AND HIS CAT.,Where nought is there to eat;
343,AND HIS CAT.,But three times more it galleth sore
344,AND HIS CAT.,To starve midst bread and meat.
345,AND HIS CAT.,
346,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: At last he is noticed by a merchant-citizen,]"
347,AND HIS CAT.,
348,AND HIS CAT.,Now just as Dick all spent and sick
349,AND HIS CAT.,"Had laid him down to die,"
350,AND HIS CAT.,A citizen of gentle mien
351,AND HIS CAT.,It chanced came walking by.
352,AND HIS CAT.,
353,AND HIS CAT.,"A merchant he of high degree,"
354,AND HIS CAT.,With ruffles all of lace;
355,AND HIS CAT.,And Nature’s true nobility
356,AND HIS CAT.,Was blazon’d in his face.
357,AND HIS CAT.,
358,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: who takes him home, and feeds him.]"
359,AND HIS CAT.,
360,AND HIS CAT.,"He up did pick and home led Dick,"
361,AND HIS CAT.,And gave him food to eat:
362,AND HIS CAT.,"Then sent him to a clean warm bed,"
363,AND HIS CAT.,Not back into the street.
364,AND HIS CAT.,
365,AND HIS CAT.,“Thank God! for that I pass’d that way
366,AND HIS CAT.,"“This night,“ the good man cried;"
367,AND HIS CAT.,"“For had I walk’d another way,"
368,AND HIS CAT.,“Poor boy! he might have died.”
369,AND HIS CAT.,
370,AND HIS CAT.,"The morning come, Dick early rose,"
371,AND HIS CAT.,And thank’d him from his heart;
372,AND HIS CAT.,And told him how no friend on earth
373,AND HIS CAT.,He had to take his part.
374,AND HIS CAT.,
375,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: This merchant becomes his friend.]
376,AND HIS CAT.,
377,AND HIS CAT.,"“Then I’m your friend,” the kind man cried,"
378,AND HIS CAT.,“And you shall live with me:
379,AND HIS CAT.,"“And you shall tend my merchandize,"
380,AND HIS CAT.,“And keep my granary.”
381,AND HIS CAT.,
382,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: and employs him in his granary;]
383,AND HIS CAT.,
384,AND HIS CAT.,"How danced for joy the lucky boy,"
385,AND HIS CAT.,To see his alter’d plight!
386,AND HIS CAT.,"He watch’d his granary by day,"
387,AND HIS CAT.,And lock’d it fast by night.
388,AND HIS CAT.,
389,AND HIS CAT.,"Now stored within this granary,"
390,AND HIS CAT.,"Were corn and wine and oil,"
391,AND HIS CAT.,And cheese and other precious things
392,AND HIS CAT.,Which rats and mice do spoil.
393,AND HIS CAT.,
394,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: where there lived a cat,]"
395,AND HIS CAT.,
396,AND HIS CAT.,So there with Dick ydwelt a cat;
397,AND HIS CAT.,A tabby cat was she:
398,AND HIS CAT.,"As sleek and soft, and eke as fat,"
399,AND HIS CAT.,As any cat could be.
400,AND HIS CAT.,
401,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: of social temper,]"
402,AND HIS CAT.,
403,AND HIS CAT.,"And she about his legs would purr,"
404,AND HIS CAT.,And on his knees would sit;
405,AND HIS CAT.,"And every meal he took, for her"
406,AND HIS CAT.,He saved a dainty bit.
407,AND HIS CAT.,
408,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: and high quality.]
409,AND HIS CAT.,
410,AND HIS CAT.,And not a mouse came near her house
411,AND HIS CAT.,But swallow’d was alive:
412,AND HIS CAT.,And not a rat but felt her pat:
413,AND HIS CAT.,No wonder she did thrive!
414,AND HIS CAT.,
415,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: The birth of a kitten:]
416,AND HIS CAT.,
417,AND HIS CAT.,"Now scarce three moons had waned and fill’d,"
418,AND HIS CAT.,"Since Dick’s lone hours she cheer’d,"
419,AND HIS CAT.,"When at her side, as Heaven will’d,"
420,AND HIS CAT.,A kitten there appear’d.
421,AND HIS CAT.,
422,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: and Dick’s twofold delight thereafter.]
423,AND HIS CAT.,
424,AND HIS CAT.,Then Dick’s delight was doubled quite;
425,AND HIS CAT.,"For one may well avouch,"
426,AND HIS CAT.,Whatever fun there was in one
427,AND HIS CAT.,In two was twice as much.
428,AND HIS CAT.,
429,AND HIS CAT.,"[Sidenote: This kitten’s surpassing beauty,]"
430,AND HIS CAT.,
431,AND HIS CAT.,All black and red this kitten’s head
432,AND HIS CAT.,Look’d like a polish’d stone:
433,AND HIS CAT.,All red and black this kitten’s back
434,AND HIS CAT.,Like tortoiseshell it shone.
435,AND HIS CAT.,
436,AND HIS CAT.,Full sure I am that well its dam
437,AND HIS CAT.,Might dote on such a kit:
438,AND HIS CAT.,The very rats that flee from cats
439,AND HIS CAT.,Would stand and stare at it.
440,AND HIS CAT.,
441,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: and most pleasant humour.]
442,AND HIS CAT.,
443,AND HIS CAT.,"Its tail it whisk’d and leapt and frisk’d,"
444,AND HIS CAT.,In weather fair and foul:
445,AND HIS CAT.,"Or cold, or hot, it matter’d not"
446,AND HIS CAT.,To such a merry soul.
447,AND HIS CAT.,
448,AND HIS CAT.,But who could see such joyful glee
449,AND HIS CAT.,And not be joyous too?
450,AND HIS CAT.,So Dick forgot his sorry lot
451,AND HIS CAT.,And laugh’d as others do.
452,AND HIS CAT.,
453,AND HIS CAT.,[Sidenote: Dick acquires his first property.]
454,AND HIS CAT.,
455,AND HIS CAT.,"Which when the merchant saw, and how"

457,AND HIS CAT.,Of his free gift to Whittington
458,AND HIS CAT.,He gave it for his own.

470,PART II.,That ye may know this true story
471,PART II.,And live in charity.
472,PART II.,

495,PART II.,To the ship’s captain told.
496,PART II.,
497,PART II.,[Sidenote: Dick’s jesting offer]
498,PART II.,
499,PART II.,"Then half in jest, and half in shame,"
500,PART II.,Dick fetch’d his kitten down:
501,PART II.,"“I too,” he to the captain cried,"
502,PART II.,“Will venture all my own.”
503,PART II.,
504,PART II.,[Sidenote: to the surprise of all]
505,PART II.,
506,PART II.,"The servants laugh’d: Dick would have wept,"
507,PART II.,And therefore laugh’d the more;
508,PART II.,But soon they stared for wonderment
509,PART II.,Who laugh’d so loud before.
510,PART II.,
511,PART II.,[Sidenote: taken in earnest by the Captain.]
512,PART II.,
513,PART II.,"For now the Captain, “Done,” he cried,"
514,PART II.,“A bargain by my fay:”
515,PART II.,"And call’d the ship’s-mate in a trice,"
516,PART II.,To stow the cat away.
517,PART II.,
518,PART II.,[Sidenote: The cat is taken aboard.]
519,PART II.,
520,PART II.,"He came so quick, no time had Dick"
521,PART II.,To countervail his joke:
522,PART II.,So all aboard poor Puss was stored
523,PART II.,Among the sea-going folk.
524,PART II.,
525,PART II.,[Sidenote: The ship sails.]
526,PART II.,
527,PART II.,"Now from her mooring, all ataut,"
528,PART II.,"Put off at turn of tide,"
529,PART II.,Adown the river’s ebbing flood
530,PART II.,The gallant bark did glide.
531,PART II.,
532,PART II.,"And, like some heavenward-soaring bird,"
533,PART II.,She faced the open seas;
534,PART II.,And seem’d as sick of land to spread
535,PART II.,Her wings before the breeze.
536,PART II.,
537,PART II.,[Sidenote: The cat at sea.]
538,PART II.,
539,PART II.,"Then, as she flew, Puss fetch’d a mew,"
540,PART II.,As if to say--poor me!
541,PART II.,To think that I a land-bred cat
542,PART II.,Should thus be press’d to sea!
543,PART II.,
544,PART II.,"But, ere a week was past and gone,"
545,PART II.,"He changed this plaintive tone,"
546,PART II.,"And, like a jolly sailor-boy,"
547,PART II.,Purr’d gaily up and down.
548,PART II.,
549,PART II.,For lean and fat a ship-board cat
550,PART II.,He found hath both to spare;
551,PART II.,And legs by hosts for rubbing posts
552,PART II.,Are always lounging there.
553,PART II.,
554,PART II.,"And then he oft would run aloft,"
555,PART II.,And just look out to sea;
556,PART II.,Nor e’er a boy could scream _ahoy_
557,PART II.,In shriller note than he.
558,PART II.,
559,PART II.,[Sidenote: The ship’s course.]
560,PART II.,
561,PART II.,"The fresh wind blew; the light bark flew,"
562,PART II.,And clear’d the channel’s mouth;
563,PART II.,"Through Biscay’s bay then cut her way,"
564,PART II.,And bore towards the South.
565,PART II.,
566,PART II.,[Sidenote: Bound for Africa.]
567,PART II.,
568,PART II.,"For she was bound for Afric ground,"
569,PART II.,Where wretched negroes dwell;
570,PART II.,"Who waste their days in idle ways,"
571,PART II.,As I am loth to tell.
572,PART II.,
573,PART II.,Nathless the soil withouten toil
574,PART II.,God’s gracious bounty yields;
575,PART II.,And gum drops free from every tree
576,PART II.,Along the sunny fields.
577,PART II.,
578,PART II.,And we are told how dust of gold
579,PART II.,Stains all the river sands:
580,PART II.,And huge beasts shed their ivory tusks
581,PART II.,About the desert lands.
582,PART II.,
583,PART II.,[Sidenote: The unthriftiness of the negroes.]
584,PART II.,
585,PART II.,Now what is not with trouble got
586,PART II.,Is seldom kept with care:
587,PART II.,For foresight and economy
588,PART II.,To idlesse strangers are.
589,PART II.,
590,PART II.,"So these poor souls their goodly stores,"
591,PART II.,"Not needed for the day,"
592,PART II.,For trifles and for tromperie
593,PART II.,They barter all away.

596,PART II.,

600,PART II.,Saint Vincent’s cape appear’d.
601,PART II.,
602,PART II.,Still southward yet three days three nights
603,PART II.,Her steady prow she bore;
604,PART II.,But when again Sol gilt the main
605,PART II.,Was spied Marocco’s shore.
606,PART II.,
607,PART II.,[Sidenote: anchors off the coast of Marocco.]
608,PART II.,
609,PART II.,Now shouts of joy and busy noise
610,PART II.,Salute the rising day:
611,PART II.,"The coast was made, the ship was stay’d,"
612,PART II.,And anchor’d in the bay.
613,PART II.,
614,PART II.,"As when a stranger hawk, that long"
615,PART II.,"Hath soar’d in middle air,"
616,PART II.,"Borne earthward on a tree alights,"
617,PART II.,And makes his station there;
618,PART II.,
619,PART II.,The myriad tenants of the grove
620,PART II.,Would fain his purpose know;
621,PART II.,"And flock around, yet hold aloof"
622,PART II.,For fear to meet a foe:
623,PART II.,
624,PART II.,[Sidenote: The wonderment of the negroes.]
625,PART II.,
626,PART II.,"’Twas thus the negroes throng’d the beach,"
627,PART II.,To view a ship at sea:
628,PART II.,While some drew down their light canoes;
629,PART II.,What mote the strange bark be?
630,PART II.,
631,PART II.,"Or friend--or foe? They long’d to know,"
632,PART II.,Yet durst not venture near:
633,PART II.,"Till soon the boat was all afloat,"
634,PART II.,And off to lay their fear.
635,PART II.,
636,PART II.,[Sidenote: Their king and queen]
637,PART II.,
638,PART II.,"Afront were seen a king and queen,"
639,PART II.,Whom all the rest obey’d:
640,PART II.,And all the good things of the land
641,PART II.,"Belong’d to them, ’twas said."
642,PART II.,
643,PART II.,[Sidenote: invited by the Captain]
644,PART II.,
645,PART II.,"Which when the captain heard, and how"
646,PART II.,"They had an ample hoard,"
647,PART II.,Their companie requested he
648,PART II.,To dine with him on board.
649,PART II.,
650,PART II.,[Sidenote: go on board.]
651,PART II.,
652,PART II.,"Now, wafted o’er the azure lake,"
653,PART II.,"The king and eke his queen,"
654,PART II.,Behold them seated on the deck:
655,PART II.,The captain sat between.
656,PART II.,
657,PART II.,[Sidenote: Puss salutes his Majesty after European fashion.]
658,PART II.,
659,PART II.,"But ere the dinner it was served,"
660,PART II.,"While yawn’d the king for meat,"
661,PART II.,"Just to divert the royal mind,"
662,PART II.,Puss rubb’d against his feet.
663,PART II.,
664,PART II.,Now you must know the royal toe
665,PART II.,It ticklish was to touch:
666,PART II.,"But Puss rubb’d he so daintily,"
667,PART II.,The king he liked it much.
668,PART II.,
669,PART II.,"Then to his bride he spake aside,"
670,PART II.,"And e’en was speaking yet,"
671,PART II.,"When lo!--the platter came,--whereat"
672,PART II.,The rest he did forget.
673,PART II.,
674,PART II.,[Sidenote: The dinner.]
675,PART II.,
676,PART II.,"Now both did eat their fill of meat,"
677,PART II.,As suiteth royalty:
678,PART II.,"No lack was there of the ship’s best fare,"
679,PART II.,And grog flow’d copiously.
680,PART II.,
681,PART II.,"[Sidenote: Puss joins the carousal,]"
682,PART II.,
683,PART II.,"And both did quaff, and both did laugh,"
684,PART II.,And both sang merrily:
685,PART II.,"Till Puss could stay no more away,"
686,PART II.,But came to join the glee.
687,PART II.,
688,PART II.,[Sidenote: his pleasantry.]
689,PART II.,
690,PART II.,"His tail he whisk’d, and leapt and frisk’d,"
691,PART II.,As he was wont before:
692,PART II.,Whereat the king and eke the queen
693,PART II.,For very mirth did roar.
694,PART II.,
695,PART II.,[Sidenote: The royal whim]
696,PART II.,
697,PART II.,"Then up he gat, and sware an oath--"
698,PART II.,"That, for so droll a thing,"
699,PART II.,"In barter, of his choicest goods"
700,PART II.,A shipload he would bring.
701,PART II.,
702,PART II.,[Sidenote: indulged at much cost.]
703,PART II.,
704,PART II.,"Thereat the captain--“Done,” he cried"
705,PART II.,“A bargain by my fay!”
706,PART II.,And sent his whole ship’s-company
707,PART II.,To fetch the goods away.
708,PART II.,
709,PART II.,[Sidenote: A merry night.]
710,PART II.,
711,PART II.,"Now laugh’d the king and laugh’d the Queen,"
712,PART II.,And laugh’d the captain he:
713,PART II.,A bargain struck at festive board
714,PART II.,Doth please so mightily.
715,PART II.,
716,PART II.,"The goods were brought, the ship was fraught,"
717,PART II.,And stow’d away full tight.
718,PART II.,"The king and queen, they drank till e’en,"
719,PART II.,And slept on board that night.
720,PART II.,
721,PART II.,[Sidenote: The next morning.]
722,PART II.,
723,PART II.,The captain rose at early dawn
724,PART II.,And call’d to th’ king anon:
725,PART II.,"“This cat is thine, this cargo’s mine;"
726,PART II.,And now I must begone.”
727,PART II.,
728,PART II.,"The king awoke and waked the queen,"
729,PART II.,"Who slept so heavily,"
730,PART II.,"That full ten minutes pass’d away,"
731,PART II.,Before that she could see.
732,PART II.,
733,PART II.,[Sidenote: The king’s maudlin humour.]
734,PART II.,
735,PART II.,Then clasping Puss within her arms
736,PART II.,She nursed him like a child.
737,PART II.,The king his humour now was sad;
738,PART II.,Nathless the monarch smiled.
739,PART II.,
740,PART II.,[Sidenote: The king and queen depart with puss.]
741,PART II.,
742,PART II.,"Then down the vessel’s side he stepp’d,"
743,PART II.,And down the queen stepp’d she.
744,PART II.,And Puss was handed down perforce
745,PART II.,To join their company.
746,PART II.,
747,PART II.,"Alongside lay the king’s canoe,"
748,PART II.,Well mann’d with negroes ten;
749,PART II.,"Who swift row’d off the royal pair,"
750,PART II.,With Puss all snug between.
751,PART II.,
752,PART II.,"[Sidenote: The ship weighs anchor,]"
753,PART II.,
754,PART II.,"Then sung the Captain--“all hand’s up,"
755,PART II.,The anchor haul amain:
756,PART II.,"Unfurl the sails, and point the prow"
757,PART II.,For British lands again.”
758,PART II.,
759,PART II.,[Sidenote: and sails homeward.]

761,PART II.,Tis done: from out the tranquil bay

780,PART III.,
781,PART III.,[Sidenote: His regret at its loss;]

787,PART III.,
788,PART III.,"[Sidenote: His melancholy vein,]"
789,PART III.,
790,PART III.,Then all was lonely as before;
791,PART III.,Again he rued his plight:
792,PART III.,"He moped in solitude all day,"
793,PART III.,And lay awake all night.
794,PART III.,
795,PART III.,[Sidenote: and wayward fancy.]
796,PART III.,
797,PART III.,So dismal and so desolate
798,PART III.,"The granary now it seem’d,"

801,PART III.,
802,PART III.,"[Sidenote: He deserts his trust,]"
803,PART III.,
804,PART III.,Alas! how weak our nature is

808,PART III.,
809,PART III.,[Sidenote: and wanders into the fields.]
810,PART III.,

815,PART III.,
816,PART III.,[Sidenote: The Lord Mayor’s day.]
817,PART III.,

836,PART III.,
837,PART III.,[Sidenote: What they seemed to say.]
838,PART III.,
839,PART III.,They seem’d to say--_Turn Whit-ting-ton_:

841,PART III.,"And when he listen’d still, they said--"
842,PART III.,_Lord May-or of Lon-don_.
843,PART III.,

847,PART III.,The same an hundred times.
848,PART III.,

853,PART III.,Oh shame! to be so false while he

855,PART III.,
856,PART III.,"He turn’d, and reach’d the granary"

860,PART III.,
861,PART III.,"[Sidenote: his good resolves,]"

890,PART III.,He stood withouten fear.
891,PART III.,
892,PART III.,[Sidenote: A visiter]
893,PART III.,
894,PART III.,"Again the day had pass’d away,"

899,PART III.,[Sidenote: brings tidings of his luck.]
900,PART III.,
901,PART III.,“Hallo! hallo! why batter so?”

904,PART III.,And in the Captain sprung.
905,PART III.,
906,PART III.,"“Good luck, good luck! my jolly buck!"

911,PART III.,[Sidenote: His incredulity.]
912,PART III.,
913,PART III.,"But Dick was so much used to woe,"
914,PART III.,He dared not trust on weal:
915,PART III.,Nor had he zest to point a jest
916,PART III.,To rouse the sailor’s peal.
917,PART III.,
918,PART III.,[Sidenote: The congratulations of the household.]
919,PART III.,
920,PART III.,Till soon the household made aware
921,PART III.,"Came rattling at the door,"
922,PART III.,"And greeted Maister Whittington,"
923,PART III.,Who was poor Dick before.
924,PART III.,
925,PART III.,"They led him forth a man of worth,"
926,PART III.,And humbly call’d him _Sire_;
927,PART III.,And placed him in a huge arm-chair
928,PART III.,Before the merchant’s fire.
929,PART III.,
930,PART III.,The good man heard the rumour’d word
931,PART III.,And eke his daughter fair;
932,PART III.,And both ran straight to where he sate
933,PART III.,All in this huge arm-chair.
934,PART III.,
935,PART III.,"’Twas then the merchant laugh’d aloud,"
936,PART III.,And then the maiden smiled:
937,PART III.,And then the servants bow’d to him
938,PART III.,They had before reviled.
939,PART III.,
940,PART III.,[Sidenote: The virtue of riches.]
941,PART III.,
942,PART III.,"For Poverty may blameless be,"
943,PART III.,Yet is an unblest thing;
944,PART III.,"And wealth, for all that good men preach,"
945,PART III.,Doth sure obeisance bring.
946,PART III.,
947,PART III.,"This truth found Dick, who grew full quick"
948,PART III.,Into an honour’d man;
949,PART III.,Yet was he loth to let his luck
950,PART III.,Abide where it began.
951,PART III.,
952,PART III.,"[Sidenote: His active industry,]"
953,PART III.,
954,PART III.,So join’d he jolly venturers
955,PART III.,In every good emprise;
956,PART III.,It was no niggard share he staked
957,PART III.,In all their argosies.
958,PART III.,
959,PART III.,[Sidenote: rewarded.]
960,PART III.,
961,PART III.,All lucky he came off at sea;
962,PART III.,"But luckier far on land,"
963,PART III.,Whenas the merchant’s daughter fair
964,PART III.,Gave him her heart and hand.
965,PART III.,
966,PART III.,[Sidenote: His honours.]
967,PART III.,
968,PART III.,"Next he became an Alderman,"
969,PART III.,And Lord Mayor before long:
970,PART III.,And then--oh! how the bells of Bow
971,PART III.,Did greet him with _ding-dong_.
972,PART III.,
973,PART III.,E’en on that day they seem’d to say
974,PART III.,_Lord May-or of Lon-don_:
975,PART III.,But when he listen’d still they said
976,PART III.,_Sir Rich-ard Whit-ting-ton_.
977,PART III.,
978,PART III.,[Sidenote: His charity.]
979,PART III.,
980,PART III.,Then thought he on the luckless lad
981,PART III.,That swept the granary floor;
982,PART III.,Nor ever in the pride of wealth
983,PART III.,Did he forget the poor.
984,PART III.,
985,PART III.,"And so God save our good Lord Mayor,"

1020,THE THREE WISHES.,Were join’d a simple pair;
1021,THE THREE WISHES.,"The man in sooth was wondrous poor,"
1022,THE THREE WISHES.,The woman wondrous fair.
1023,THE THREE WISHES.,
1024,THE THREE WISHES.,"[Sidenote: Love is not covetous,]"
1025,THE THREE WISHES.,
1026,THE THREE WISHES.,"What wonder then that they should love,"
1027,THE THREE WISHES.,As none e’er loved before;
1028,THE THREE WISHES.,"And tho’ few worldly goods they had,"
1029,THE THREE WISHES.,They coveted no more.

1031,THE THREE WISHES.,"[Sidenote: but, whether woman’s, or man’s,]"
1032,THE THREE WISHES.,
1033,THE THREE WISHES.,"For woman is a generous thing,"
1034,THE THREE WISHES.,And loves for love alone;
1035,THE THREE WISHES.,"And man he loves for beauty’s sake,"
1036,THE THREE WISHES.,And dotes on flesh and bone.
1037,THE THREE WISHES.,
1038,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: consists not with starvation;]
1039,THE THREE WISHES.,
1040,THE THREE WISHES.,"But flesh and bone they must be fed,"
1041,THE THREE WISHES.,As all the world doth know;
1042,THE THREE WISHES.,Withouten food the loveliest flesh
1043,THE THREE WISHES.,Most hideous soon doth grow.
1044,THE THREE WISHES.,
1045,THE THREE WISHES.,"Nor bone will thrive on love alone,"

1053,THE THREE WISHES.,"And though he was so poor,"
1054,THE THREE WISHES.,"The man, who had no goods within,"
1055,THE THREE WISHES.,Scarce passed without the door.
1056,THE THREE WISHES.,
1057,THE THREE WISHES.,"The woman loved him still so much,"
1058,THE THREE WISHES.,She wish’d for nought instead;
1059,THE THREE WISHES.,"Yet did she pine, each night to go"
1060,THE THREE WISHES.,All supperless to bed.

1068,THE THREE WISHES.,
1069,THE THREE WISHES.,"I too, quoth she, do love thee now"
1070,THE THREE WISHES.,As ne’er I loved before;
1071,THE THREE WISHES.,"Yet, were I not so hungry, I"
1072,THE THREE WISHES.,Methinks should love thee more.

1076,THE THREE WISHES.,"Alas, said he, that poverty"

1078,THE THREE WISHES.,"I fain would work,--but love thee so,"
1079,THE THREE WISHES.,I cannot leave thy side:
1080,THE THREE WISHES.,
1081,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: and unavailing wishes:]
1082,THE THREE WISHES.,
1083,THE THREE WISHES.,I wish that we were very rich!
1084,THE THREE WISHES.,"She answer’d,--I am thine:"
1085,THE THREE WISHES.,"And, though I never cared for wealth,"
1086,THE THREE WISHES.,Thy wishes shall be mine.
1087,THE THREE WISHES.,
1088,THE THREE WISHES.,Scarce had they spoke when on the hearth
1089,THE THREE WISHES.,Appear’d a little fay:
1090,THE THREE WISHES.,"So beautiful she was, the room"
1091,THE THREE WISHES.,It shone as bright as day.
1092,THE THREE WISHES.,
1093,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: of which even the full indulgence]
1094,THE THREE WISHES.,
1095,THE THREE WISHES.,"Then waving thrice her lily hand,"
1096,THE THREE WISHES.,In silver tones she spake;—
1097,THE THREE WISHES.,"Thrice may ye wish what wish ye please,"
1098,THE THREE WISHES.,And thrice your wish shall take.
1099,THE THREE WISHES.,
1100,THE THREE WISHES.,"I am your guardian fay, she said,"
1101,THE THREE WISHES.,And joy to see your love:
1102,THE THREE WISHES.,What would ye more to make you blest
1103,THE THREE WISHES.,As spirits are above?
1104,THE THREE WISHES.,
1105,THE THREE WISHES.,"The beauteous fay then vanishing,"
1106,THE THREE WISHES.,The man he kiss’d his wife;
1107,THE THREE WISHES.,And swore he never was before
1108,THE THREE WISHES.,So happy in his life.
1109,THE THREE WISHES.,
1110,THE THREE WISHES.,"Now shall I be a lord, said he,"
1111,THE THREE WISHES.,"A bishop, or a king?"
1112,THE THREE WISHES.,"We’ll think it o’er to night, nor wish"
1113,THE THREE WISHES.,In haste for any thing.
1114,THE THREE WISHES.,
1115,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: would end in folly.]
1116,THE THREE WISHES.,
1117,THE THREE WISHES.,"Be it, said she; to-morrow then"
1118,THE THREE WISHES.,"We’ll wish one wish, my dear:"
1119,THE THREE WISHES.,"In the meantime, I only wish"
1120,THE THREE WISHES.,We had some pudding here.
1121,THE THREE WISHES.,
1122,THE THREE WISHES.,"Ah! luckless wish! upon the word,"
1123,THE THREE WISHES.,A pudding straightway came:
1124,THE THREE WISHES.,"At which the man wax’d high with rage,"
1125,THE THREE WISHES.,The woman low with shame.
1126,THE THREE WISHES.,
1127,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: Then folly begets anger;]
1128,THE THREE WISHES.,
1129,THE THREE WISHES.,"And as she hid her blushing eyes,"
1130,THE THREE WISHES.,And crouch’d upon a stool;
1131,THE THREE WISHES.,"The man he rose and stamp’d his foot,"
1132,THE THREE WISHES.,And cursed her for a fool.
1133,THE THREE WISHES.,
1134,THE THREE WISHES.,"He stamp’d his foot, and clench’d his fist,"
1135,THE THREE WISHES.,And scarce refrain’d from blows:
1136,THE THREE WISHES.,"A pudding! zounds, cried he, I wish"
1137,THE THREE WISHES.,You had it at your nose!
1138,THE THREE WISHES.,
1139,THE THREE WISHES.,"Up rose the pudding as he spake,"
1140,THE THREE WISHES.,"And, like an air-balloon,"
1141,THE THREE WISHES.,"Was borne aloft in empty space,"
1142,THE THREE WISHES.,But oh! it settled soon:
1143,THE THREE WISHES.,
1144,THE THREE WISHES.,"[Sidenote: and anger strife,]"
1145,THE THREE WISHES.,
1146,THE THREE WISHES.,Too soon it settled on the nose
1147,THE THREE WISHES.,Of his unhappy wife:
1148,THE THREE WISHES.,Alas! how soon an angry word
1149,THE THREE WISHES.,Turns harmony to strife!
1150,THE THREE WISHES.,
1151,THE THREE WISHES.,For now the woman sobb’d aloud
1152,THE THREE WISHES.,To feel the pudding there;
1153,THE THREE WISHES.,"And in her turn was angry too,"
1154,THE THREE WISHES.,And call’d the man a bear.
1155,THE THREE WISHES.,
1156,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: followed by remorse and shame.]
1157,THE THREE WISHES.,
1158,THE THREE WISHES.,"But when their anger had burnt out,"
1159,THE THREE WISHES.,Its ash remain’d behind;
1160,THE THREE WISHES.,Remorse and shame that they had been
1161,THE THREE WISHES.,So foolish and so blind.
1162,THE THREE WISHES.,
1163,THE THREE WISHES.,"The man brake silence first, and said,—"
1164,THE THREE WISHES.,"Two wishes now are gone,"
1165,THE THREE WISHES.,"And nothing gain’d; but one remains,"
1166,THE THREE WISHES.,And much may still be done.—
1167,THE THREE WISHES.,
1168,THE THREE WISHES.,Oh were it so! but I have gain’d
1169,THE THREE WISHES.,What much I wish to lose--
1170,THE THREE WISHES.,"The woman blurted, as she saw"
1171,THE THREE WISHES.,The pudding at her nose.
1172,THE THREE WISHES.,
1173,THE THREE WISHES.,"Then off the pudding flew amain,"
1174,THE THREE WISHES.,And roll’d into the dish:
1175,THE THREE WISHES.,For she in sooth unwittingly
1176,THE THREE WISHES.,Had wish’d the other wish.
1177,THE THREE WISHES.,
1178,THE THREE WISHES.,"Now when the man saw what was done,"
1179,THE THREE WISHES.,His choler quick return’d;
1180,THE THREE WISHES.,"But when he look’d into her face,"
1181,THE THREE WISHES.,With love again he burn’d.
1182,THE THREE WISHES.,
1183,THE THREE WISHES.,"[Sidenote: But love consists with a lowly estate,]"
1184,THE THREE WISHES.,
1185,THE THREE WISHES.,"For now she smiled as she was wont,"
1186,THE THREE WISHES.,"And seem’d so full of charms,"
1187,THE THREE WISHES.,That all unmindful of the past
1188,THE THREE WISHES.,He rush’d into her arms.
1189,THE THREE WISHES.,
1190,THE THREE WISHES.,"Oh! how I joy thou’rt not, she said,"
1191,THE THREE WISHES.,"Nor bishop, king, nor lord!"
1192,THE THREE WISHES.,"I love thee better as thou art,"
1193,THE THREE WISHES.,"I do, upon my word!"
1194,THE THREE WISHES.,
1195,THE THREE WISHES.,"And I, said he, do dote on thee:"
1196,THE THREE WISHES.,"For now the pudding’s gone,"
1197,THE THREE WISHES.,There’s not a face in any place
1198,THE THREE WISHES.,So pretty as thine own!
1199,THE THREE WISHES.,
1200,THE THREE WISHES.,"[Sidenote: so there be contentment,]"
1201,THE THREE WISHES.,
1202,THE THREE WISHES.,"But as we have the pudding here,"
1203,THE THREE WISHES.,"’Tis all we want,--said she,"
1204,THE THREE WISHES.,Suppose we just sit down awhile
1205,THE THREE WISHES.,And eat it merrily.
1206,THE THREE WISHES.,
1207,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: and industry.]
1208,THE THREE WISHES.,
1209,THE THREE WISHES.,"With all my heart, my love, said he,"
1210,THE THREE WISHES.,For I am hungry too:
1211,THE THREE WISHES.,"From this time forth, I’ll strive to earn"
1212,THE THREE WISHES.,Enough for me and you.
1213,THE THREE WISHES.,
1214,THE THREE WISHES.,[Sidenote: Moral.]
1215,THE THREE WISHES.,
1216,THE THREE WISHES.,"The fay then reappear’d, and spake"
1217,THE THREE WISHES.,The moral of my song:—
1218,THE THREE WISHES.,"“Man wants but little here below,"
1219,THE THREE WISHES.,Nor wants that little long.”
1220,THE THREE WISHES.,
1221,THE THREE WISHES.,"Love is a heavenly prize in sooth,"
1222,THE THREE WISHES.,"But earthborn flesh and bone,"
1223,THE THREE WISHES.,"If they would love, must live as well,"
1224,THE THREE WISHES.,And cannot love alone.
1225,THE THREE WISHES.,
1226,THE THREE WISHES.,"Then strive to earn the bread of life,"
1227,THE THREE WISHES.,And guard your body’s health;
1228,THE THREE WISHES.,"But mark--enough is all you want,"
1229,THE THREE WISHES.,And competence is wealth.
1230,THE THREE WISHES.,
1231,THE THREE WISHES.,"And to that happy soul, who love"
1232,THE THREE WISHES.,"With competency blends,"
1233,THE THREE WISHES.,Contentment is a crown of joy!—
1234,THE THREE WISHES.,And here the moral ends.

1266,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"A LITTLE girl once lived in a cottage near a tree,"
1267,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"A pretty little girl she was, and good as she could be."
1268,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Her father often kiss’d her; and her mother loved her so,"
1269,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"That if the king had pledged his crown for her, she had said--no."
1270,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Her grandmother, who lived in a village through a wood,"
1271,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Had made her little granddaughter a nice red riding-hood,"
1272,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,This riding-hood she used to wear whenever she walk’d out;
1273,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"It was so smart, the boys and girls would follow her about."
1274,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And all the neighbours loved her, and to see her often came;"
1275,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,And little Dame Red-riding-hood they call’d her for her name.
1276,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1277,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"One beautiful fine morning when her mother had been churning,"
1278,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,This little girl upon the hearth some nice sweet cakes was turning:
1279,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And whisper’d softly to herself, how well our oven bakes!"
1280,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Oh, how I wish that grandmamma could taste these nice sweet cakes!"
1281,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Her mother who was close behind, and heard her little mutter,"
1282,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Then you shall take her some, she said, with some of my fresh butter."
1283,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"But loiter not upon the road, nor from the footpath stray,"
1284,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,For many wicked folks there be might harm thee by the way.
1285,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"As soon as she had heard these words, oh! how she jump’d for joy!"
1286,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,For she old granny loved as much as most love a new toy.
1287,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"She put on her red-riding-hood, and started off in haste;"
1288,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,All eager for her grandmother her nice sweet cakes to taste.
1289,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And thus as on she trotted with her basket on her arm,"
1290,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,She little thought that any one would wish to do her harm.
1291,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1292,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Now when she came into the wood, through which the footpath lay,"
1293,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"The birds were singing all around, the flowers were blooming gay."
1294,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Such yellow buttercups she saw, such violets white and blue,"
1295,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Such primroses, such sweet-briars, and honey-suckles too;"
1296,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"That, oh! she thought within herself, I wish Mamma were here:"
1297,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,I’m sure she’d let me stop awhile; there can be nought to fear:
1298,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,I must just pick these pretty flowers which smell so fresh and sweet:
1299,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,’Twill be so nice to take her home a nose-gay for a treat.
1300,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"She told me not to loiter here, nor from the footpath stray;"
1301,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And so I wont stop very long, nor wander far away."
1302,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And so she stopp’d, nor thought of harm, because she knew not what:"
1303,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,Enough it should have been to know--Mamma had told her not.
1304,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And from the path she stray’d away, and pick’d a thousand flowers;"
1305,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,And all the birds did welcome her within their leafy bowers.
1306,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"But, as it so fell out, a wolf was basking in the grass,"
1307,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,And soon with his sharp hazel eyes espied the little lass.
1308,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And then he trotted up to her, and right before her stood:"
1309,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"How do you do, my dear? said he; what brings you to my wood?"
1310,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Now though his coat was very rough, his words were soft and kind;"
1311,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,And not a single thought of fear e’er cross’d her simple mind.
1312,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And so she freely said,--I go to see my Granny, Sir,"
1313,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,Who lives in yonder village in the cottage near the fir.
1314,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"I am her little pet, you know, and take her nice sweet cakes--"
1315,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Good bye; said he, and brush’d away thro’ bushes and thro’ brakes."
1316,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And not five minutes had pass’d by since he had quitted her,"
1317,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,Before he reach’d the village and the cottage near the fir.
1318,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1319,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,He rubb’d and scratch’d against the door; but she was ill in bed;
1320,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And when he tried to make a knock, she feebly raised her head;"
1321,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And cried, who knocks at Martha’s door, and poor old Martha wakes?"
1322,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"It is your little pet, said he, who brings you nice sweet cakes."
1323,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"God help you, dearest child, she cried, so pull the string you know;"
1324,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And up the latch will go, my love, and you may enter so."
1325,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Then up he jump’d to reach the string, and open flew the door;"
1326,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And in he walk’d, and fasten’d it, just as it was before."
1327,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Alas! alas!--as you or I on bread and milk would sup,"
1328,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,The greedy wolf this poor old dame he gobbled fairly up.
1329,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1330,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"But now, ashamed of what he’d done, he jump’d into her bed;"
1331,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And put her gown upon his back, her cap upon his head."
1332,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"But ere he long had lain, there came the very little pet,"
1333,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,Who long’d to tell her Granny of the kind wolf she had met.
1334,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And gently tapping at the door, she whisper’d soft and still;"
1335,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And the false wolf spake huskily, as he were very ill:"
1336,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Who knocks at Martha’s door, he cried, and poor old Martha wakes?"
1337,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"It is her little pet, said she, who brings her nice sweet cakes."
1338,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"God help you, dearest, cried the wolf, so pull the string you know;"
1339,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And up the latch will go, my love, and you may enter so."
1340,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Then up she jump’d to reach the string, and open flew the door;"
1341,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And in she stepp’d, and fasten’d it, just as it was before."
1342,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1343,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Now take off your red riding-hood, and come to me in bed:"
1344,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"He spake with an affected voice, and cover’d up his head."
1345,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"The little damsel, as he spoke, just saw his hairy nose:"
1346,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Yet now she did as she was bid, and so pull’d off her clothes."
1347,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1348,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Oh! Granny, what rough arms you’ve got! I’m not afraid, cried she:"
1349,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Rough arms? my dearest child, he said; better for hugging thee."
1350,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Oh! Granny, what sharp eyes you’ve got! I’m half afraid, cried she:"
1351,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Sharp eyes? my dearest child, he said; better for seeing thee."
1352,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Oh! Granny, what long ears you’ve got! I’m quite afraid, cried she:"
1353,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Long ears? my dearest child, he said; better for hearing thee."
1354,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Oh! Granny, what wide lips you’ve got! I think you’ll swallow me:"
1355,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Wide lips? my dearest child, he said; better for kissing thee."
1356,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Thus having said, he kisses gave her one--two--three--and four;"
1357,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"And then--he would have eat her up, but he could eat no more."
1358,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,
1359,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"So little people all take heed, and do as you are bid;"
1360,LITTLE RED-RIDING-HOOD,"Lest you some day should meet a wolf, as this poor maiden did."

1397,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,OLD Cormoran of Michael’s mount
1398,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"By all his teeth he swore,"
1399,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"That he would eat more butcher’s meat,"
1400,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Than a whole host from Cornwall’s coast
1401,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Of ten or fifteen score.
1402,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1403,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,In Arthur’s reign this Giant lived;
1404,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,A Giant huge was he:
1405,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"His name was known in every town,"
1406,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"From Devon’s border to Land’s-end,"
1407,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And eke from sea to sea.
1408,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1409,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Six fingers on each hand he bore,"
1410,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Six toes upon each foot:
1411,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,An ox’s hide his glove supplied;
1412,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And three times ten stout Cornish men
1413,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Could sleep within his boot.
1414,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1415,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And while he bathed his monstrous legs,"
1416,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And straddled in the seas,"
1417,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,The bravest ship of Arthur’s fleet
1418,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Might sail between his knees.
1419,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1420,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,His breath was like a gale of wind
1421,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,As now-a-days it blows:
1422,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,His sneeze was like a hurricane;
1423,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And leagues around was heard the sound
1424,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,When he did blow his nose.
1425,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1426,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,His laugh was like a thunderclap
1427,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,If e’er in jest he spoke;
1428,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And the waves that lay in Michael’s bay
1429,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Shook, like a merry company,"
1430,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Responsive to his joke.
1431,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1432,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Thrice every day he gorged his fill,"
1433,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And thrice he drank as well:
1434,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"One herd at least of salted swine,"
1435,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"One hundred fatted beeves in brine,"
1436,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And eke a thousand casks of wine,"
1437,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Were stow’d within his cell.
1438,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1439,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"On every sabbath day at morn,"
1440,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"While Church-bells toll’d for prayer,"
1441,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"He took his club and took his horn,"
1442,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And took his belt with iron welt,"
1443,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And through the sea did fare.
1444,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1445,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Then foraging the country round
1446,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,He pillaged every farm;
1447,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And hogs and sheep and oxen too
1448,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Were fell’d by his strong arm:
1449,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And then he bound them in his belt,"
1450,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And round his waist huge loads did pack,"
1451,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And swung the rest across his back,"
1452,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And sought his isle again:
1453,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And not a man of all who dwelt
1454,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Or high or low within that shire,"
1455,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Or peasant, parson or esquire,"
1456,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,But dreaded Cormoran.
1457,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1458,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The very magistrates themselves,"
1459,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Who once a fortnight did dispense
1460,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"King Arthur’s justice at Penzance,"
1461,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Despite of justice and of law
1462,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,He made them cater for his maw:
1463,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And tho’ they lived in rusty pride,"
1464,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Nor took their country’s pay,"
1465,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"He spared them not for that a jot,"
1466,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,But used to say the balance lay
1467,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Upon the country’s side.
1468,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1469,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"In sooth it was a grievous sight,"
1470,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And sad it is to tell,"
1471,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"When Cormoran came o’er the sea,"
1472,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,What fearful things befel:
1473,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"He had no shame of his ill name,"
1474,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,No sneaking thief was born;
1475,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,But standing stiff on the main cliff
1476,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Nine times he wound his horn.
1477,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1478,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Oh then I ween you might have seen
1479,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,All nature in despair!
1480,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The bird soar’d high toward the sky,"
1481,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,The wild beast sought his lair.
1482,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1483,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The sheep ran huddling to a nook,"
1484,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,As they had seen a wolf:
1485,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The snorting colt defied the brook,"
1486,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Or plunged into the gulf.
1487,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1488,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The lazy-grouping steers, that grazed"
1489,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Upon the mountain fell,"
1490,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Forgot their pasture all amazed,"
1491,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And pour’d into the dell.
1492,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1493,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,The pigs that buried in the straw
1494,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Lay grunting snug and warm,"
1495,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Now helter-skelter scurried off,"
1496,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,As if they smelt a storm.
1497,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1498,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The watch-dog tore against his chain,"
1499,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,As he would choke with rage:
1500,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"But when he listen’d once agen,"
1501,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"He knew the voice of Cormoran,"
1502,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And skulk’d into his den.
1503,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1504,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"From every steeple on the coast,"
1505,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"And eke from every tower,"
1506,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,The village bells right merrily
1507,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Did chime the matins-hour;
1508,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"But when they heard th’ accursed blast,"
1509,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Each sturdy sexton stood aghast;
1510,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The rope it glided from his grasp,"
1511,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And silence reign’d around:
1512,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Save here and there where sudden jerk
1513,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Had follow’d interrupted work,"
1514,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Like dying man’s convulsive gasp,"
1515,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,There came a jangling sound.
1516,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,
1517,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"The lads and lasses, who that morn"
1518,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Had donn’d their high-day trim,"
1519,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Were pacing solemnly to prayer,"
1520,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,In modest guise and prim.
1521,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Apart they walk’d in decent pride,"
1522,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And scarcely ventured side by side:
1523,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,But hark! it was--it was--
1524,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,’Twas Cormoran! they knew the sound
1525,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"That paralysed the country round,"
1526,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And hurried off in mass.
1527,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Forgetful now of prayer and pride
1528,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"In groups they thrid the forest wide,"
1529,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Or lurk in caves together:
1530,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,And here and there a plighted pair
1531,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,"Wander aloof in mute despair,"
1532,JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.,Or crouch upon the heather.

1539,PART II.,
1540,PART II.,_Ingentes animos angusto in pectore._
1541,PART II.,
1542,PART II.,"IN Cornwall then there lived a youth,"
1543,PART II.,(Such may that land ne’er lack)
1544,PART II.,"His mother call’d him “Johnny dear,”"
1545,PART II.,His father call’d him Jack.
1546,PART II.,
1547,PART II.,"In sooth he was of gentle mien,"
1548,PART II.,And of a nature kind:
1549,PART II.,"And though his body it was small,"
1550,PART II.,It held a mighty mind.
1551,PART II.,
1552,PART II.,"For he had read of fairy tales,"
1553,PART II.,And deeds of high emprize;
1554,PART II.,"And envied knights who died in fights,"
1555,PART II.,Or lived in ladies’ eyes.
1556,PART II.,
1557,PART II.,"And not a wrestling match there was,"
1558,PART II.,But Jack would try his skill;
1559,PART II.,And not a fair but Jack was there
1560,PART II.,To wreak his merry will.
1561,PART II.,
1562,PART II.,"And while he sat upon some rock,"
1563,PART II.,"And watch’d his sheep by day,"
1564,PART II.,"His eyes were with his silly flock,"
1565,PART II.,His soul was far away.
1566,PART II.,
1567,PART II.,Sometimes he went to beard intent
1568,PART II.,A Giant in his den;
1569,PART II.,Sometimes he thought he singly fought
1570,PART II.,With twice two hundred men:
1571,PART II.,
1572,PART II.,"And when he found himself aground,"
1573,PART II.,Not caring to be slain
1574,PART II.,"He sprang afoot, and off he shot"
1575,PART II.,Till he might breathe again.
1576,PART II.,
1577,PART II.,Now Jack while he sat thoughtfully
1578,PART II.,"One glorious sabbath morn,"
1579,PART II.,"It so befel, as I did tell,"
1580,PART II.,That Cormoran wound his horn.
1581,PART II.,
1582,PART II.,"The ewes were browsing o’er the downs,"
1583,PART II.,And scatter’d far away;
1584,PART II.,"The lusty lambs had drain’d their dams,"
1585,PART II.,And gamboll’d off to play.
1586,PART II.,
1587,PART II.,Now all did prick their ears right quick
1588,PART II.,Astounded at the blast;
1589,PART II.,"As if a kite had soar’d in sight,"
1590,PART II.,Or fox had skulken past.
1591,PART II.,
1592,PART II.,"And then they scour’d about the lay,"
1593,PART II.,"And piteously did bleat,"
1594,PART II.,Till in the throng that rush’d along
1595,PART II.,Each one its own might meet.
1596,PART II.,
1597,PART II.,"Cried Jack--It is a shame, I wis,"
1598,PART II.,A burning shame to see
1599,PART II.,"This Cormoran, a single man,"
1600,PART II.,Defy the whole countrie!
1601,PART II.,
1602,PART II.,What! tho’ no hand on Cornish land
1603,PART II.,Can wield the giant’s axe:
1604,PART II.,"One heart there is as stout as his,"
1605,PART II.,And that one heart is Jack’s.
1606,PART II.,
1607,PART II.,"And, if I know a trick or two"
1608,PART II.,"May serve me in good stead,"
1609,PART II.,This very night my mark I’ll write
1610,PART II.,Upon the giant’s head.
1611,PART II.,
1612,PART II.,"That day pass’d by most tediously,"
1613,PART II.,"And Jack the hours did count,"
1614,PART II.,Till night came on and he was gone
1615,PART II.,Alone to Michael’s mount.
1616,PART II.,
1617,PART II.,"His horn was at his collar hung,"
1618,PART II.,His hatchet in his hand;
1619,PART II.,Adown his side his spade was tied;
1620,PART II.,A pickaxe at his back was slung;
1621,PART II.,And thus he left the land.
1622,PART II.,
1623,PART II.,"Across the bay he held his way,"
1624,PART II.,And swam with all his might;
1625,PART II.,It was so dark he scarce could mark
1626,PART II.,The mountain’s frowning height.
1627,PART II.,
1628,PART II.,"But soon he gain’d the rocky land,"
1629,PART II.,And dripping from the wave
1630,PART II.,"He peer’d around, till he had found"
1631,PART II.,The hateful giant’s cave.
1632,PART II.,
1633,PART II.,There right afore the giant’s door
1634,PART II.,He dug a huge big hole;
1635,PART II.,Full deep and wide on every side
1636,PART II.,He scoop’d it like a mole.
1637,PART II.,
1638,PART II.,With muchel toil he moved the soil;
1639,PART II.,"And then, to hide his tricks,"
1640,PART II.,Above the cavern’s gaping mouth
1641,PART II.,He wove a frame of sticks.
1642,PART II.,
1643,PART II.,A frame of sticks just strong enough
1644,PART II.,To bear the living sward;
1645,PART II.,"Which he so laid o’er as it was before,"
1646,PART II.,Not a trace of the hole appear’d.
1647,PART II.,
1648,PART II.,"Then pickaxe, spade, and hatchet too"
1649,PART II.,Upon the ground he cast:
1650,PART II.,And he took his horn to salute the morn
1651,PART II.,And blew a jolly blast.
1652,PART II.,
1653,PART II.,"Now how he danced, and how he pranced,"
1654,PART II.,To think what he had done!
1655,PART II.,"But when he heard what then he heard,"
1656,PART II.,He well nigh burst for fun.
1657,PART II.,
1658,PART II.,“Holloa--Yaugh! Holloa--Yaugh!
1659,PART II.,Who dares wake Cormoran?
1660,PART II.,"As I am good, by my father’s blood,"
1661,PART II.,I smell a breathing man!”
1662,PART II.,
1663,PART II.,"Then he rubb’d his eyes and drove to rise,"
1664,PART II.,"But woke so tardily,"
1665,PART II.,"That while he yawn’d the morning dawn’d,"
1666,PART II.,And Jack bethought to flee.
1667,PART II.,
1668,PART II.,But while yet slumber his lids did cumber
1669,PART II.,He blew another blast;
1670,PART II.,"And the giant rush’d out and blink’d about,"
1671,PART II.,Till Jack he spied at last.
1672,PART II.,
1673,PART II.,What whipster is that scarce as tall as a cat?
1674,PART II.,He’ll do to broil or bake:
1675,PART II.,But he’s too small for me withal
1676,PART II.,This long night’s fast to break.
1677,PART II.,
1678,PART II.,"Tis Jack, I swear! ah Jack, mon cher,"
1679,PART II.,This is a merry bout!
1680,PART II.,I’ll pay your score--and all before
1681,PART II.,Your mother knows you’re out.
1682,PART II.,
1683,PART II.,So on he strode: but soon he trod
1684,PART II.,Aboon Jack’s handywork;
1685,PART II.,"When in he fell, and roll’d pell-mell"
1686,PART II.,Blaspheming like a Turk.
1687,PART II.,
1688,PART II.,"Then Jack peep’d in, and rubb’d his chin,"
1689,PART II.,While thus he spake his foe:—
1690,PART II.,"Now, as you’re good, by your father’s blood,"
1691,PART II.,"Dear giant, swear not so."
1692,PART II.,
1693,PART II.,"Why thus perplex’d and sorely vex’d,"
1694,PART II.,Kind heart! for me and mine?
1695,PART II.,My mother knows I’m out;--but does
1696,PART II.,Your father know you’re in?
1697,PART II.,
1698,PART II.,At Jack’s keen wit the giant bit
1699,PART II.,His flesh with grief and pain:
1700,PART II.,Then with mock glee--Bravo! cried he:
1701,PART II.,Now help me out again.
1702,PART II.,
1703,PART II.,Jack quick replied: on either side
1704,PART II.,With both your hands hold tight:
1705,PART II.,"While I take care to seize your hair,"
1706,PART II.,And pull with all my might.
1707,PART II.,
1708,PART II.,The Giant did as he was bid;
1709,PART II.,When Jack his humour spoke:
1710,PART II.,For though so brave and seeming grave
1711,PART II.,He dearly loved a joke.
1712,PART II.,
1713,PART II.,"“Stay, stay: the air is cold up here,"
1714,PART II.,And you are delicate:
1715,PART II.,It sure were best to breakfast first;
1716,PART II.,I well can spare to wait.
1717,PART II.,
1718,PART II.,"But broil not me, who am you see"
1719,PART II.,Scarce taller than a cat:
1720,PART II.,"Not half enough, besides I’m tough;"
1721,PART II.,Do pray instead take--that:”—
1722,PART II.,
1723,PART II.,"Whereat a thump he dealt so plump,"
1724,PART II.,"Upon the Giant’s head,"
1725,PART II.,"That down he roll’d upon the mould,"
1726,PART II.,And there he lay like dead.
1727,PART II.,
1728,PART II.,Then Jack jump’d down and kneeling on
1729,PART II.,Him pull’d his clasp-knife out;
1730,PART II.,"And here he gash’d, and there he slash’d,"
1731,PART II.,As one would crimp a trout.
1732,PART II.,
1733,PART II.,Now such a flood of giant’s blood
1734,PART II.,"Came rushing from each wound,"
1735,PART II.,"Jack well had need to off with speed,"
1736,PART II.,Or sooth he had been drown’d.
1737,PART II.,
1738,PART II.,"Then up he sprang, and, like a cock"
1739,PART II.,"That dead hath struck his foe,"
1740,PART II.,"He stood aloof upon a rock,"
1741,PART II.,And thus began to crow.
1742,PART II.,
1743,PART II.,The deed is done! the game is won!
1744,PART II.,Great Cormoran is slain!
1745,PART II.,"Now frisk and leap, my pretty sheep,"
1746,PART II.,All merrily again.
1747,PART II.,
1748,PART II.,The deed is done! the game is won!
1749,PART II.,Right glorious Jack will be:
1750,PART II.,All Cornwall’s coast his fame shall boast
1751,PART II.,For this great victory!
1752,PART II.,
1753,PART II.,"But who can know who struck the blow,"
1754,PART II.,Since none were here to see?
1755,PART II.,What boots to Jack if he go back
1756,PART II.,Without some true trophee?
1757,PART II.,
1758,PART II.,For men in sooth are wondrous loth
1759,PART II.,To spend a word of praise:
1760,PART II.,Though great and small are prodigal
1761,PART II.,Of evil words always.
1762,PART II.,
1763,PART II.,But off to bear the Giant’s gear
1764,PART II.,Jack was too weak of limb:
1765,PART II.,He scarce could stand the weight on land;
1766,PART II.,Then how with it to swim?
1767,PART II.,
1768,PART II.,Wherefor he felt beneath his belt;
1769,PART II.,Perchance he there mote wear
1770,PART II.,"A signet, or some love-token,"
1771,PART II.,Or lock of lady’s hair.
1772,PART II.,
1773,PART II.,"For who so fierce, but love may pierce"
1774,PART II.,"His breast, to all unknown?"
1775,PART II.,"What heart so sere, but springs a tear"
1776,PART II.,In secret and alone?
1777,PART II.,
1778,PART II.,But Cormoran was not the man
1779,PART II.,To rue his lonely couch:
1780,PART II.,Nor pledge nor plight of lady bright
1781,PART II.,Was there within his pouch.
1782,PART II.,
1783,PART II.,"There lay alone a steer’s thigh-bone,"
1784,PART II.,"Sharp pointed, huge, and thick;"
1785,PART II.,Wherewith he used (for tell’t I must)
1786,PART II.,His monstrous teeth to pick.
1787,PART II.,
1788,PART II.,"Now this took Jack, and on his back"
1789,PART II.,He slung the ugly spoil:
1790,PART II.,"And thus again he swam the main,"
1791,PART II.,Sore sick of blood and toil.
1792,PART II.,
1793,PART II.,"The morn was bright, the breeze was light,"
1794,PART II.,Jack stemm’d the wave meanwhile:
1795,PART II.,And all Penzance came forth to see
1796,PART II.,Who left the Giant’s isle.
1797,PART II.,
1798,PART II.,"They mark’d him ride the buoyant tide,"
1799,PART II.,As one of stubborn mind;
1800,PART II.,And how he cleft his way and left
1801,PART II.,A blood-red track behind.—
1802,PART II.,
1803,PART II.,Now Jack once more on Cornwall’s shore
1804,PART II.,Unslung his huge trophee:
1805,PART II.,"And all flock’d round, and mark’d with stound"
1806,PART II.,What this strange thing mote be.
1807,PART II.,
1808,PART II.,So thick! so long! so sharp! so strong!
1809,PART II.,They saw the truth full quick:
1810,PART II.,For who but he its lord could be?
1811,PART II.,’Twas Cormoran’s own tooth-pick!
1812,PART II.,
1813,PART II.,"And who could seize that pocket-piece,"
1814,PART II.,Nor pay for’t with his head?
1815,PART II.,And who e’er felt beneath that belt?
1816,PART II.,It must be he was dead!
1817,PART II.,
1818,PART II.,"Then did they shout with joyous rout,"
1819,PART II.,And Jack bore off amain:
1820,PART II.,"Right up Penzance they led their dance,"
1821,PART II.,Then led it down again.
1822,PART II.,
1823,PART II.,It chanced that morn the Ealdorman
1824,PART II.,Sat there in civic state;
1825,PART II.,On matters high of polity
1826,PART II.,For to deliberate.
1827,PART II.,
1828,PART II.,So when this noise of men and boys
1829,PART II.,"Resounded through the street,"
1830,PART II.,He felt the weight of high estate
1831,PART II.,And trembled in his seat.
1832,PART II.,
1833,PART II.,But soon a scout who had peep’d out
1834,PART II.,These welcome tidings told:—
1835,PART II.,"“They bring a lad--some thief, or pad!”"
1836,PART II.,Whereat he waxed more bold.
1837,PART II.,
1838,PART II.,For though he had no heart to beard
1839,PART II.,"A burglar stout and tall,"
1840,PART II.,"He yet was glad to trounce a lad,"
1841,PART II.,Because he was so small.
1842,PART II.,
1843,PART II.,"But threats soon turn to promises,"
1844,PART II.,"And punishment to praise,"
1845,PART II.,When Jack walks in and on the board
1846,PART II.,The giant’s tooth-pick lays!
1847,PART II.,
1848,PART II.,"The Ealdorman is all astound,"
1849,PART II.,And scarce his eyes believes;
1850,PART II.,For ’twas long syne that he did dine
1851,PART II.,Upon his own fat beeves.
1852,PART II.,
1853,PART II.,"As fitting meed for such brave deed,"
1854,PART II.,He fain would wealth bestow:
1855,PART II.,But money there was then as rare
1856,PART II.,"As now-a-days, I trow."
1857,PART II.,
1858,PART II.,But honour shone more bright than coin
1859,PART II.,Before Jack’s noble eyes:
1860,PART II.,Awake--asleep--he still might keep
1861,PART II.,Untarnish’d this fair prize.
1862,PART II.,
1863,PART II.,"The Ealdorman then rising up,"
1864,PART II.,"While Jack before him knelt,"
1865,PART II.,"In Arthur’s name he dubb’d him knight,"
1866,PART II.,And girt him with a belt.
1867,PART II.,
1868,PART II.,"The belt it was of good leather,"
1869,PART II.,With letters stamp’d of gold;
1870,PART II.,And all the world might read thereon
1871,PART II.,This simple history told:—
