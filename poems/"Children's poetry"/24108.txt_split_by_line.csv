11,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
12,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Adapted from the French of La Fontaine.

20,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","E-Book Created by Tyler Anderson,"
21,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",as a birthday present to little

27,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",They May Become Better Acquainted

33,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",A Preface For Parents
34,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
35,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",La Fontaine composed the most entertaining Fables ever
36,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","written in any language, and made them a model of literary"
37,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",perfection; yet our translators and compilers have somehow
38,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","neglected him. His Fables are lyric poetry of a high order,"
39,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",and this alone has doubtless been a barrier to a better
40,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",acquaintance with his work when transferred to our own
41,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","tongue. Done into prose, the Fables are no longer"
42,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","La Fontaine, but take their place with the many"
43,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","respectable, dull translations which English readers try to"
44,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",admire because they are classics--though the soul that
45,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",made them such has been separated from the dead body.
46,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
47,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",It has seemed to me that while the full enjoyment of
48,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",La Fontaine must always be reserved for those who can
49,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","read him in French, it might be possible at least to convey"
50,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",something of his originality and blithe spirit through the
51,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",medium of light verse. In making the attempt I am fully
52,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","aware of my temerity, and the criticism it will invite. To"
53,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",excuse the one and to meet the other I have taken refuge
54,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","in the term ""adaptation""--even though the word applies"
55,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",only in part to my paraphrases. Some of the Fables in
56,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","this book are translations in a true sense, and keep"
57,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",closely to the text. From others I have erased such
58,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","political, mythological and literary allusions (in which"
59,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",La Fontaine abounds) as are either obsolete or
60,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",unintelligible to a child.
61,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
62,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",But my chief literary sin--if sin it be--is twofold. In the first
63,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",place I have departed wholly from the metrical arrangements
64,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",of the originals--substituting therefore a variety of forms in
65,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",line and stanza that more accord with the modern and
66,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",American ear. In the second place I have had the
67,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","hardihood--as in ""The Lion and The Gnat""--to modify the"
68,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",elegance of the original with phrases more appropriate to
69,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","our contemporary beasts. Animal talk, I feel sure, has lost"
70,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",something of its stateliness since the days when our
71,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",French author overheard it. The Owl is no less pedantic
72,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","perhaps, but the Lion certainly has declined in"
73,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",majesty--along with our human kings.
74,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
75,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","For these offenses, La Fontaine--who forgave everyone--is"
76,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","bound to forgive me. The most good-humored Frenchmen,"
77,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",he could condone all faults but dullness. That offense
78,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",against French fundamental principles invariably put him
79,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",to sleep--whether the bore who button-holed him was a
80,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",savant of the Sorbonne or just an ordinary ass.
81,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
82,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",One thing more. This little collection from his 240 Fables is
83,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","meant, first of all, for children. In assembling it no Fable"
84,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",was admitted that has not been approved by generations
85,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",of the young and old. No apologue addressed to the
86,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","mature intelligence alone, or framed to fit the society"
87,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","of his day, is here included."
88,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
89,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Many books which men have agreed to call classics are
90,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",seldom taken down from the shelves. It is otherwise with
91,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",La Fontaine. His Fables were eagerly read by the great
92,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","men and women of his time, and are still read and"
93,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",enjoyed all the world over.
94,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
95,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",The causes of this lasting popularity are not obscure. From
96,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","the earliest period--whether in India, Greece, Arabia or"
97,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Rome--the Fable has pleased and instructed mankind. It
98,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","told important truths, easily perceived, in an entertaining"
99,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",way; and often said more in a few words than could be
100,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","said through any other kind of writing. Now, no one person"
101,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",is the author of the Fables we know so well. Aesop did not
102,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",write the Fables bearing his name. There is even reason to
103,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","believe that Aesop is himself a Fable. At any rate, the"
104,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","things ascribed to him are the work of many hands, and"
105,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",have undergone many changes. These old stories of
106,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","animals began to be written so long ago, and the history"
107,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","of them is so vague and confusing, that only in recent"
108,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","years have scholars at last been able to trace them, and"
109,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",to fix their authorship.
110,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
111,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","The significant thing to keep in mind is that, for twentieth"
112,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","century readers, the best Fables are not merely the best"
113,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","ones ever written, but the best ones re-written. In other"
114,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","words, the Fable was for centuries an old story in a rough"
115,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","state, and the writers who have made it most interesting"
116,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",are the writers who told it over again in a manner that
117,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","makes it Art. A Greek named Babrius, of whom almost"
118,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","nothing is known, is remembered because he collected"
119,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",and versified some of the so-called Fables of Aesop. A
120,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Roman slave named Phaedrus also put these Fables
121,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",into Latin verse; and his work to-day is a text book in
122,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",our colleges.
123,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
124,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Among modern writers, it was reserved for La Fontaine to"
125,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",take these ancient themes and make them his own--just
126,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","as Moliere, ""taking his own wherever he found it,"" borrowed"
127,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",freely from the classics for his greatest plays; just as
128,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Shakespeare re-formed forgotten tales with the glow and
129,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","splendor of surpassing genius, so La Fontaine turned to"
130,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","India, Greece, Italy, and furnishing the old Fables and"
131,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","facetious tales, refreshed them with his originality. Some"
132,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","of them were his own inventions, but for the most part"
133,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","they were ""Aesop"" and Phaedrus, made over by poetic"
134,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",art and vivified with a wit and humor characteristically
135,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",French.
136,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
137,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","But if La Fontaine's fame endures, it is not alone that he"
138,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",was the greatest lyric poet of a great literary period.
139,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Apart from the wit and fancy of his creations--apart from
140,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","the philosophy, wisdom, and knowledge of human nature"
141,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","that so delighted Moliere, Boileau and Racine--his Fables"
142,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",disclose the goodness and simplicity of one who lived
143,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","much with Nature, and cared nothing for the false"
144,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",splendors of the court. Living most of his life in the
145,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","country, the woods, and streams and fields had been a"
146,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",constant source of inspiration. He saw animals through
147,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",the eyes of a naturalist and poet; and when he came to
148,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","make them talk, the little fishes ""talked like little"
149,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","fishes--not like whales"". With Shakespeare's banished"
150,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Frenchman in the Forest of Arden, he"
151,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,"
152,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Sermons in stones, and good in everything."
153,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
154,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",An anecdote often told of him aptly illustrates his habit
155,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","of mind. He was late in coming to a fashionable dinner,"
156,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",and his excuse was this:
157,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""I hope you will pardon me,"" he said. ""I was detained at"
158,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","the funeral of an ant, and I could not come until the"
159,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","ceremony was over."""
160,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
161,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","This was not a pleasantry, but the truth. He had been"
162,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","watching an ant-hill, and was so absorbed in observing"
163,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",a dead ant carried off by the living colonists for burial
164,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",that he had forgotten his engagement.
165,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
166,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","The first six volumes of the Fables--published in 1668,"
167,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","when he was 47, and in Paris--were an immediate and"
168,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","brilliant success, at a time when French genius was in"
169,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",full flower. But the literary men of that golden age got
170,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","their pecuniary reward not from the public, but from"
171,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","patrons. Later in life, when La Fontaine at last was"
172,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","graciously recognized by the grand monarch, he"
173,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",appeared before the royal presence to receive his due.
174,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Even then, with his usual absentmindedness, he forgot"
175,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","to bring the book he was to present, and left behind him"
176,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",in the carriage the purse of gold the King bestowed
177,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",upon him.
178,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
179,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","However, the Fables brought him much in fame and"
180,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",friendship. Everybody loved La Fontaine. Favorite of great
181,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","lords and ladies, the court of Louis XIV could not make"
182,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","him otherwise than natural. Poor and improvident, poverty"
183,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",had no pangs for him. No sorrow ever gave him a
184,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",sleepless hour. To the last he lived up to his
185,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",nickname--Bon-homme. And it is the gentle and good
186,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",man who is always looking out at us at us from the
187,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",fables he refashioned for all time.

192,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
193,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
194,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",This book contains the following Fables
195,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",from the French of La Fontaine:

218,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",The Frog Who Wished To Be As Big As The Ox.
219,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
220,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",There was a little Fog
221,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Whose home was in a bog,"
222,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",And he worried 'cause he wasn't big enough.
223,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",He sees an ox and cries:
224,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""That's just about my size,"
225,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","If I stretch myself--Say Sister, see me puff!"""
226,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
227,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","So he blew, blew, blew,"
228,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Saying: ""Sister, will that do?"""
229,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",But she shook her head. And then he lost his wits.
230,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",For he stretched and puffed again
231,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Till he cracked beneath the strain,"
232,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","And burst, and flew about in little bits."
233,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
234,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
235,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
236,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",The Grasshopper And The Ant.
237,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
238,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","The Grasshopper, singing"
239,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","All summer long,"
240,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Now found winter stinging,"
241,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",And ceased in his song.
242,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Not a morsel or crumb in his cupboard--
243,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","So he shivered, and ceased in his song."
244,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
245,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Miss Ant was his neighbor;
246,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",To her he went:
247,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""O, you're rich from labor,"
248,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",And I've not a cent.
249,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Lend me food, and I vow I'll return it,"
250,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Though at present I have not a cent."""
251,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
252,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","The Ant's not a lender,"
253,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",I must confess.
254,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Her heart's far from tender
255,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",To one in distress.
256,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","So she said: ""Pray, how passed you the summer,"
257,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","That in winter you come to distress?"""
258,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
259,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""I sang through the summer,"""
260,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Grasshopper said.
261,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""But now I am glummer"
262,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Because I've no bread."""
263,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""So you sang!"" sneered the Ant. ""That relieves me."
264,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Now it's winter--go dance for your bread!"""
265,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
266,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
267,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
268,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",The Cat And The Fox.
269,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
270,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","The Cat and the Fox once took a walk together,"
271,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Sharpening their wits with talk about the weather
272,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","And as their walking sharpened appetite, too;"
273,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",They also took some things they had no right to.
274,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Cream, that is so delicious when it thickens,"
275,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Pleased the Cat best. The Fox liked little chickens.
276,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
277,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","With stomachs filled, they presently grew prouder,"
278,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",And each began to try to talk the louder--
279,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Bragging about his skill, and strength, and cunning."
280,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""Pooh!"" said the Fox. ""You ought to see me running."
281,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Besides, I have a hundred tricks. You Cat, you!"
282,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","What can you do when Mr. Dog comes at you?"""
283,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""To tell the truth,"" the Cat said, ""though it grieve me"
284,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","I've but one trick. Yet that's enough--believe me!"""
285,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
286,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","There came a pack of fox-hounds--yelping, baying."
287,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","""Pardon me"", said the Cat. ""I can't be staying."
288,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","This is my trick."" And up a tree he scurried,"
289,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Leaving the Fox below a trifle worried.
290,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
291,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",In vain he tried his hundred tricks and ruses
292,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",(The sort of thing that Mr. Dog confuses)--
293,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","Doubling, and seeking one hole, then another--"
294,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Smoked out of each until he thought he'd smother.
295,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","At last as he once more came out of cover,"
296,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",Two nimble dogs pounced on him--All was over!

309,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",
310,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,","So greedy was he,"
311,"FABLES IN RHYME FOR LITTLE FOLKS,",He was not satisfied.
