50,PREFACE,
51,TO THE MOTHER,TO THE MOTHER
52,TO THE MOTHER,
53,TO THE MOTHER,"_""A Court as of angels,"
54,TO THE MOTHER,"A public not to be bribed,"
55,TO THE MOTHER,"Not to be entreated,"
56,TO THE MOTHER,"Not to be overawed.""_"
57,TO THE MOTHER,
58,TO THE MOTHER,"_Such is the audience--in long clothes or short frocks, in pinafores"
59,TO THE MOTHER,"or kilts, or in the brief trousers that bespeak the budding man--such"
60,TO THE MOTHER,"is the crowing, laughing court, the toddling public that awaits these"
61,TO THE MOTHER,verses._
62,TO THE MOTHER,
63,TO THE MOTHER,"_Every home, large or small, poor or rich, that has a child in it, is"
64,TO THE MOTHER,"a Pinafore Palace, and we have borrowed the phrase from one of"
65,TO THE MOTHER,"childhood's most whimsical and devoted poets-laureate, thinking no"
66,TO THE MOTHER,other words would so well express our meaning._
67,TO THE MOTHER,
68,TO THE MOTHER,"_If the two main divisions of the book--""The Royal Baby"" and ""Little"
69,TO THE MOTHER,"Prince and Princess""--should seem to you a trifle sentimental it will"
70,TO THE MOTHER,be because you forget for the moment the gayety and humor of the
71,TO THE MOTHER,title with its delightful assumptions of regal dignity and state.
72,TO THE MOTHER,"Granted the Palace itself, everything else falls easily into line, and"
73,TO THE MOTHER,if you cannot readily concede the royal birth and bearing of your
74,TO THE MOTHER,neighbor's child you will see nothing strange in thinking of your own
75,TO THE MOTHER,"nursling as little prince or princess, and so you will be able to"
76,TO THE MOTHER,"accept gracefully the sobriquet of Queen Mother, which is yours by the"
77,TO THE MOTHER,same invincible logic!_
78,TO THE MOTHER,
79,TO THE MOTHER,"_Oh, yes, we allow that instead of being gravely editorial in our"
80,TO THE MOTHER,"attitude, we have played with the title, as well as with all the"
81,TO THE MOTHER,"sub-titles and classifications, feeling that it was the next"
82,TO THE MOTHER,pleasantest thing to playing with the babies themselves. It was so
83,TO THE MOTHER,delightful to re-read the well-loved rhymes of our own childhood and
84,TO THE MOTHER,try to find others worthy to put beside them; so delicious to imagine
85,TO THE MOTHER,the hundreds of young mothers who would meet their old favorites in
86,TO THE MOTHER,these particular pages; and so inspiring to think of the thousands of
87,TO THE MOTHER,new babies whose first hearing of nursery classics would be associated
88,TO THE MOTHER,"with this red-covered volume, that we found ourselves in a joyous mood"
89,TO THE MOTHER,which we hope will be contagious. Nothing is surer than that a certain
90,TO THE MOTHER,gayety of heart and mind constitute the most wholesome climate for
91,TO THE MOTHER,"young children. ""The baby whose mother has not charmed him in his"
92,TO THE MOTHER,cradle with rhyme and song has no enchanting dreams; he is not gay and
93,TO THE MOTHER,"he will never be a great musician,"" so runs the old Swiss saying._"
94,TO THE MOTHER,
95,TO THE MOTHER,"_Youthful mothers, beautifully and properly serious about their"
96,TO THE MOTHER,"strange new duties and responsibilities, need not fear that Mother"
97,TO THE MOTHER,Goose is anything but healthful nonsense. She holds a place all her
98,TO THE MOTHER,"own, and the years that have rolled over her head (some of the rhymes"
99,TO THE MOTHER,going back to the sixteenth century) only give her a firmer footing
100,TO THE MOTHER,among the immortals. There are no real substitutes for her unique
101,TO THE MOTHER,"rhymes, neither can they be added to nor imitated; for the world"
102,TO THE MOTHER,nowadays is seemingly too sophisticated to frame just this sort of
103,TO THE MOTHER,"merry, light-hearted, irresponsible verse which has mellowed with the"
104,TO THE MOTHER,"years. ""These ancient rhymes,"" says Andrew Lang, ""are smooth stones"
105,TO THE MOTHER,"from the brook of time, worn round by constant friction of tongues"
106,TO THE MOTHER,"long silent.""_"
107,TO THE MOTHER,
108,TO THE MOTHER,"_Nor is your use of this ""light literature of the infant scholar"" in"
109,TO THE MOTHER,"the nursery without purpose or value. You are developing ear, mind,"
110,TO THE MOTHER,"and heart, and laying a foundation for a later love of the best things"
111,TO THE MOTHER,"in poetry. Whatever else we may do or leave undone, if we wish to"
112,TO THE MOTHER,widen the spiritual horizon of our children let us not close the
113,TO THE MOTHER,"windows on the emotional and imaginative sides. ""There is in every one"
114,TO THE MOTHER,"of us a poet whom the man has outlived."" Do not let the poetic"
115,TO THE MOTHER,instinct die of inanition; keep it alive in the child by feeding his
116,TO THE MOTHER,"youthful ardor, strengthening his insight, guarding the sensitiveness"
117,TO THE MOTHER,"and delicacy of his early impressions, and cherishing the fancies that"
118,TO THE MOTHER,"are indeed ""the trailing clouds of glory"" he brings with him ""from God"
119,TO THE MOTHER,"who is his home.""_"
120,TO THE MOTHER,
121,TO THE MOTHER,_The rhythm of verse will charm his senses even in his baby days;
122,TO THE MOTHER,later on he will feel the beauty of some exquisite lyric phrase as
123,TO THE MOTHER,"keenly as you do, for the ear will have been opened and will be"
124,TO THE MOTHER,satisfied only with what is finest and best._
125,TO THE MOTHER,
126,TO THE MOTHER,"_The second division of the book ""Little Prince and Princess"" will"
127,TO THE MOTHER,"take the children out of the nursery into the garden, the farmyard,"
128,TO THE MOTHER,"and the world outside the Palace, where they will meet and play with"
129,TO THE MOTHER,"their fellows in an ever-widening circle of social activity. ""Baby's"
130,TO THE MOTHER,"Hush-a-byes"" in cradle or mother's lap will now give place to the"
131,TO THE MOTHER,"quiet cribside talks called ""The Palace Bed Time"" and ""The Queen"
132,TO THE MOTHER,"Mother's Counsel""; and in the story hour ""The Palace Jest-Book"" will"
133,TO THE MOTHER,furnish merriment for the youngsters who laughed the year before over
134,TO THE MOTHER,the simpler nonsense of Mother Goose._
135,TO THE MOTHER,
136,TO THE MOTHER,_When the pinafores themselves are cast aside Pinafore Palace will be
137,TO THE MOTHER,"outgrown, and you can find something better suited to the developing"
138,TO THE MOTHER,"requirements of the nursery folk in ""The Posy Ring."" Then the third"
139,TO THE MOTHER,"volume in our series--""Golden Numbers""--will give boys and girls from"
140,TO THE MOTHER,ten to fifteen a taste of all the best and soundest poetry suitable to
141,TO THE MOTHER,"their age, and after that they may enter on their full birthright,"
142,TO THE MOTHER,"""the rich deposit of the centuries.""_"
143,TO THE MOTHER,
144,TO THE MOTHER,"_No greater love for a task nor happiness in doing it, no more ardent"
145,TO THE MOTHER,"wish to please a child or meet a mother's need, ever went into a book"
146,TO THE MOTHER,than have been wrought into this volume and its three predecessors. We
147,TO THE MOTHER,hope that it will find its way into the nurseries where wealth has
148,TO THE MOTHER,provided every means of ministering to the young child's growth in
149,TO THE MOTHER,"body, mind, and soul; and if some of the Pinafore Palaces should be"
150,TO THE MOTHER,"neat little kitchens, what joy it would be to think of certain young"
151,TO THE MOTHER,queen-mothers taking a breath between tasks to sit by the fire and
152,TO THE MOTHER,"read to their royal babies while the bread is baking, the kettle"
153,TO THE MOTHER,"boiling, or the potatoes bubbling in the pot._"
154,TO THE MOTHER,
155,TO THE MOTHER,"_""Where does Pinafore Palace stand?"
156,TO THE MOTHER,"Right in the middle of Lilliput Land.""_"
157,TO THE MOTHER,
158,TO THE MOTHER,_And Lilliput Land is (or ought to be) the freeest country in the
159,TO THE MOTHER,"universe. Its shining gates open wide at dawn, closing only at sunset,"
160,TO THE MOTHER,and toddling pilgrims with eager faces enter and wander about at will.
161,TO THE MOTHER,"Decked in velvet or clad in rags the friendly porter pays no heed, for"
162,TO THE MOTHER,the pinafores hide all class distinctions._
163,TO THE MOTHER,
164,TO THE MOTHER,"_""We're bound for Pinafore Palace, sir,"""
165,TO THE MOTHER,They say to the smiling gatekeeper.
166,TO THE MOTHER,"""Do we need, if you please, an entrance ticket"
167,TO THE MOTHER,"Before we pass through your magic wicket?"""
168,TO THE MOTHER,"""Oh, no, little Prince and Princess dear,"
169,TO THE MOTHER,"All pinafores freely enter here!""_"

2017,NURSERY NOVELS,When I was a bachelor
2018,NURSERY NOVELS,I lived by myself;
2019,NURSERY NOVELS,And all the bread and cheese I got

2022,NURSERY NOVELS,The rats and the mice
2023,NURSERY NOVELS,"They made such a strife,"
2024,NURSERY NOVELS,I was forced to go to London

2026,NURSERY NOVELS,
2027,NURSERY NOVELS,"The streets were so bad,"
2028,NURSERY NOVELS,"And the lanes were so narrow,"
2029,NURSERY NOVELS,I was forced to bring my wife home

2031,NURSERY NOVELS,
2032,NURSERY NOVELS,"The wheelbarrow broke,"

2037,NURSERY NOVELS,

2039,NURSERY NOVELS,No bigger than my thumb;
2040,NURSERY NOVELS,"I put him in a pint-pot,"
2041,NURSERY NOVELS,And there I bade him drum.
2042,NURSERY NOVELS,
2043,NURSERY NOVELS,"I bought a little horse,"
2044,NURSERY NOVELS,That galloped up and down;
2045,NURSERY NOVELS,"I bridled him, and saddled him,"
2046,NURSERY NOVELS,And sent him out of town.
2047,NURSERY NOVELS,
2048,NURSERY NOVELS,"I gave him little garters,"
2049,NURSERY NOVELS,"To garter up his hose,"
2050,NURSERY NOVELS,"And a little handkerchief,"
2051,NURSERY NOVELS,To wipe his little nose.

2053,NURSERY NOVELS,
2054,NURSERY NOVELS,"Sing a song of sixpence,"
2055,NURSERY NOVELS,A pocket full of rye;
2056,NURSERY NOVELS,Four-and-twenty blackbirds
2057,NURSERY NOVELS,Baked in a pie;
2058,NURSERY NOVELS,
2059,NURSERY NOVELS,When the pie was opened
2060,NURSERY NOVELS,The birds began to sing;
2061,NURSERY NOVELS,Was not that a dainty dish
2062,NURSERY NOVELS,To set before the King?
2063,NURSERY NOVELS,
2064,NURSERY NOVELS,"The King was in his counting-house,"
2065,NURSERY NOVELS,Counting out his money;
2066,NURSERY NOVELS,"The Queen was in the parlour,"
2067,NURSERY NOVELS,Eating bread and honey;
2068,NURSERY NOVELS,
2069,NURSERY NOVELS,The maid was in the garden
2070,NURSERY NOVELS,Hanging out the clothes;
2071,NURSERY NOVELS,"When up came a blackbird,"
2072,NURSERY NOVELS,And nipped off her nose.
2073,NURSERY NOVELS,
2074,NURSERY NOVELS,
2075,NURSERY NOVELS,"Little Bo-peep, she lost her sheep,"
2076,NURSERY NOVELS,And can't tell where to find them;
2077,NURSERY NOVELS,"Leave them alone, and they'll come home,"
2078,NURSERY NOVELS,And bring their tails behind them.
2079,NURSERY NOVELS,
2080,NURSERY NOVELS,"Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,"
2081,NURSERY NOVELS,And dreamed she heard them bleating;
2082,NURSERY NOVELS,"When she awoke she found it a joke,"
2083,NURSERY NOVELS,For they still were all fleeting.
2084,NURSERY NOVELS,
2085,NURSERY NOVELS,"Then up she took her little crook,"
2086,NURSERY NOVELS,Determined for to find them;
2087,NURSERY NOVELS,"She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,"
2088,NURSERY NOVELS,For they'd left their tails behind them!
2089,NURSERY NOVELS,
2090,NURSERY NOVELS,"It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray,"
2091,NURSERY NOVELS,Unto a meadow hard by--
2092,NURSERY NOVELS,"There she espied their tails side by side,"
2093,NURSERY NOVELS,All hung on a tree to dry.
2094,NURSERY NOVELS,
2095,NURSERY NOVELS,"She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,"
2096,NURSERY NOVELS,And over the hillocks she raced;
2097,NURSERY NOVELS,"And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,"
2098,NURSERY NOVELS,That each tail should be properly placed.
2099,NURSERY NOVELS,
2100,NURSERY NOVELS,
2101,NURSERY NOVELS,"There was a little man,"
2102,NURSERY NOVELS,"And he had a little gun,"
2103,NURSERY NOVELS,"And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;"
2104,NURSERY NOVELS,"He went to the brook,"
2105,NURSERY NOVELS,"And he saw a little duck,"
2106,NURSERY NOVELS,"And he shot it right through the head, head, head."
2107,NURSERY NOVELS,
2108,NURSERY NOVELS,"He carried it home,"
2109,NURSERY NOVELS,"To his good wife Joan,"
2110,NURSERY NOVELS,"And bid her make a fire for to bake, bake, bake,"
2111,NURSERY NOVELS,To roast the little duck
2112,NURSERY NOVELS,"He had shot in the brook,"
2113,NURSERY NOVELS,"And he'd go fetch her next the drake, drake, drake."
2114,NURSERY NOVELS,
2115,NURSERY NOVELS,"The drake had gone to sail,"
2116,NURSERY NOVELS,"With his nice curly tail,"
2117,NURSERY NOVELS,"The little man made it his mark, mark, mark."
2118,NURSERY NOVELS,"But he let off his gun,"
2119,NURSERY NOVELS,"And he fired too soon,"
2120,NURSERY NOVELS,"So the drake flew away with a quack, quack, quack."
2121,NURSERY NOVELS,
2122,NURSERY NOVELS,
2123,NURSERY NOVELS,"Three little kittens, they lost their mittens,"
2124,NURSERY NOVELS,"And they began to cry,"

2145,NURSERY NOVELS,"_Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r._"
2146,NURSERY NOVELS,
2147,NURSERY NOVELS,"The three little kittens put on their mittens,"
2148,NURSERY NOVELS,And soon ate up the pie;
2149,NURSERY NOVELS,"_O mother dear,_"
2150,NURSERY NOVELS,"_We greatly fear,_"
2151,NURSERY NOVELS,_That we have soiled our mittens._
2152,NURSERY NOVELS,Soiled your mittens!
2153,NURSERY NOVELS,You naughty kittens!
2154,NURSERY NOVELS,"Then they began to sigh,"
2155,NURSERY NOVELS,"_Mee-ow; mee-ow, mee-ow._"
2156,NURSERY NOVELS,"Then they began to sigh,"
2157,NURSERY NOVELS,"_Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow._"
2158,NURSERY NOVELS,
2159,NURSERY NOVELS,"The three little kittens they washed their mittens,"
2160,NURSERY NOVELS,And hung them out to dry;
2161,NURSERY NOVELS,"_O mother dear,_"
2162,NURSERY NOVELS,"_Do you not hear,_"
2163,NURSERY NOVELS,_That we have washed our mittens?_
2164,NURSERY NOVELS,Washed your mittens!
2165,NURSERY NOVELS,"O, you're good kittens."
2166,NURSERY NOVELS,But I smell a rat close by:

4227,THE PALACE PETS,"When Midget was a puppy,"
4228,THE PALACE PETS,"And to the farm was brought,"
4229,THE PALACE PETS,She found that there were many things
4230,THE PALACE PETS,A puppy must be taught.
4231,THE PALACE PETS,
4232,THE PALACE PETS,Her mother oft had told her
4233,THE PALACE PETS,The first thing to be known
4234,THE PALACE PETS,"Was how to gnaw and bite, and thus"
4235,THE PALACE PETS,Enjoy a toothsome bone.
4236,THE PALACE PETS,
4237,THE PALACE PETS,So Midget practiced biting
4238,THE PALACE PETS,"On everything around,"
4239,THE PALACE PETS,"But that was not approved at all,"
4240,THE PALACE PETS,"To her surprise, she found."
4241,THE PALACE PETS,
4242,THE PALACE PETS,"The farmer spoke severely,"
4243,THE PALACE PETS,Till Midget shook with fright;
4244,THE PALACE PETS,"The children shouted ""No, no, no!"
4245,THE PALACE PETS,"Bad Midget! Mustn't bite!"""
4246,THE PALACE PETS,
4247,THE PALACE PETS,'Twas just the same with barking;
4248,THE PALACE PETS,"At first they all said ""Hark!"""
4249,THE PALACE PETS,Whenever Midget tried her voice;
4250,THE PALACE PETS,"""Good puppy! that's it! Bark!"""
4251,THE PALACE PETS,
4252,THE PALACE PETS,"But then, as soon as Midget"
4253,THE PALACE PETS,"Could sound a sharp ""Bow-wow!"""
4254,THE PALACE PETS,"Alas! the talk was changed to ""Hush!"
4255,THE PALACE PETS,"Such noise we can't allow."""
4256,THE PALACE PETS,
4257,THE PALACE PETS,Now wasn't that a puzzle?
4258,THE PALACE PETS,"It seemed a problem dark,"
4259,THE PALACE PETS,That it was right and wrong to bite
4260,THE PALACE PETS,And right and wrong to bark.
4261,THE PALACE PETS,
4262,THE PALACE PETS,A puppy's hardest lesson
4263,THE PALACE PETS,Is when to bark and bite;
4264,THE PALACE PETS,"But Midget learned it, and became"

4280,THE PALACE PETS,"She shall sit by my side,"

4285,THE PALACE PETS,"I'll pat little Pussy,"

4289,THE PALACE PETS,"I'll not pinch her ears,"

5737,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Little baby dear, good-night."
5738,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5739,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Yes, my darling, well I know"
5740,THE PALACE BED-TIME,How the bitter wind doth blow;
5741,THE PALACE BED-TIME,And the winter's snow and rain
5742,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Patter on the window-pane:
5743,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"But they cannot come in here,"
5744,THE PALACE BED-TIME,To my little baby dear;
5745,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5746,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"For the window shutteth fast,"
5747,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Till the stormy night is past;

5758,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"As I walked over the hill one day,"
5759,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I listened, and heard a mother-sheep say,"
5760,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"""In all the green world there is nothing so sweet"
5761,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"As my little lamb, with his nimble feet;"
5762,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"With his eye so bright,"
5763,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"And his wool so white,"
5764,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Oh, he is my darling, my heart's delight!"""
5765,THE PALACE BED-TIME,And the mother-sheep and her little one
5766,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Side by side lay down in the sun;
5767,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"And they went to sleep on the hill-side warm,"
5768,THE PALACE BED-TIME,While my little lammie lies here on my arm.
5769,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5770,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I went to the kitchen, and what did I see"
5771,THE PALACE BED-TIME,But the old gray cat with her kittens three!
5772,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I heard her whispering soft: said she,"
5773,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"""My kittens, with tails so cunningly curled,"
5774,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Are the prettiest things that can be in the world.
5775,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"The bird on the tree,"

5778,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"But I love my kittens there,"
5779,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Under the rocking-chair.
5780,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I love my kittens with all my might,"
5781,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I love them at morning, noon, and night."
5782,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Now I'll take up my kitties, the kitties I love,"
5783,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"And we'll lie down together beneath the warm stove."""
5784,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Let the kittens sleep under the stove so warm,"
5785,THE PALACE BED-TIME,While my little darling lies here on my arm.
5786,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5787,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I went to the yard, and I saw the old hen"
5788,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Go clucking about with her chickens ten;
5789,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"She clucked and she scratched and she bustled away,"
5790,THE PALACE BED-TIME,And what do you think I heard the hen say?
5791,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"I heard her say, ""The sun never did shine"
5792,THE PALACE BED-TIME,On anything like to these chickens of mine.
5793,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"You may hunt the full moon and the stars, if you please,"
5794,THE PALACE BED-TIME,But you never will find ten such chickens as these.
5795,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"My dear, downy darlings, my sweet little things,"
5796,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Come, nestle now cozily under my wings."""
5797,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"So the hen said,"
5798,THE PALACE BED-TIME,And the chickens all sped
5799,THE PALACE BED-TIME,As fast as they could to their nice feather bed.
5800,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"And there let them sleep, in their feathers so warm,"

5807,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5808,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Some things go to sleep in such a funny way:
5809,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Little birds stand on one leg and tuck their heads away;
5810,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5811,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Chickens do the same, standing on their perch;"
5812,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Little mice lie soft and still as if they were in church;
5813,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5814,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Kittens curl up close in such a funny ball;
5815,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Horses hang their sleepy heads and stand still in a stall;
5816,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5817,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Sometimes dogs stretch out, or curl up in a heap;"
5818,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Cows lie down upon their sides when they would go to sleep.
5819,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5820,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"But little babies dear are snugly tucked in beds,"
5821,THE PALACE BED-TIME,"Warm with blankets, all so soft, and pillows for their heads."
5822,THE PALACE BED-TIME,
5823,THE PALACE BED-TIME,Bird and beast and babe--I wonder which of all
