263,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"deaf old lady next door, and its name is Jetty. Another is yellow, and"
264,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,belongs to the lame girl in the white house with green blinds; its name
265,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"is Topaz. The third cat is gray, with white front and paws. This is a"
266,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"lady cat, and her name is Malta; she belongs to the lady whom Johnny"
267,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"calls Mrs. Nose. Mamma does not allow him to say this, and he tries to"
268,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"remember, but sometimes he forgets; one day he said right out, “Good"
269,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"morning, Mrs. Nose!” and she only laughed, and said her nose was just"
270,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"the right size, and she needed it all to smell catnip with. She is a"
271,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"funny lady, and Johnny likes her, and Malta too."
272,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,
273,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"The fourth cat belongs to Mr. Chops the butcher, and is a big tabby,"
274,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,with green eyes and fierce whiskers. Johnny does not like him at all.
275,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"But the fifth cat is Muffet, his own dear white kitten."
276,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,
277,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"Now all these cats were friends except Bobs, the butcher’s cat. He"
278,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"lives on meat, and Mamma says perhaps that makes him cross. Anyhow, he"
279,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"is cross, and he growls and snarls and spits at Muffet and Jetty and"
280,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"Topaz and Malta, and tries to steal their fishbones, and upsets their"
281,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"milk, and is really a very horrid cat."

285,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"The story happened one night last week. Johnny was asleep, and Maggie"
286,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"was tidying up the nursery before going to bed, when suddenly she heard"
287,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"a queer noise. It came from the yard, and she stepped to the window"
288,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,and looked out. It was bright moonlight; and what do you think? The
289,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"cats were having a party in the sand box! the four friendly cats, that"
290,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"is, Muffet and Topaz and Malta and Jetty. Maggie thought Muffet must"
291,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"have invited the others, for she was sitting in the middle of the box"
292,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"with her front paws tucked under her, looking so pleased and happy;"
293,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"and the three others had their paws tucked in too, and they were all"
294,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"four talking in little soft mews, and seemed to be having a very good"
295,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"time. Then all of a sudden there was a snarl and a yowl, and that"
296,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"horrid great Bobs sprang over the fence and into the sand box, and"
297,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"began clawing and spitting and scratching right and left, just as hard"
298,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,as he could. At first the four friendly cats were too startled to do
299,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,anything; but in another minute _they_ began to spit and scratch and
300,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"claw, and there were all five of them rolling over and over, scattering"
301,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"the sand on every side, and making such a noise that it woke Johnny"
302,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"out of his sound sleep. At first he was frightened, but Maggie told"
303,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"him what it was, and said wait and see what she would do. She pushed"
304,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"up the fly screen very softly, and then she brought the great big jug"
305,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"full of water, and leaning out,—splash! she emptied it full on the"
306,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"fighting, struggling cats. _Oh!_ how they yelled! One jumped this way,"
307,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,and one jumped that; and the next moment not one was left except poor
308,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"little Muffet, sitting in the middle of the box and crying pitifully."
309,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"“Oh, _poor_ Muffy!” said Johnny. “Poor Muffy _all_ wet!” So then good"
310,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"Maggie ran down and brought Muffet up, and dried her with a towel, and"
311,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,comforted her till she purred. Johnny wanted to take her into bed with
312,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"him, but Maggie said that never would do; so,—what _do_ you think? She"
313,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"put her in the doll’s cradle with Susan Dolly, and covered her up, and"
314,JOHNNY AND HIS SAND BOX,"told her to go to sleep, and she did!"

406,THE NEW LEAVES,"At the foot of the bed stood a boy about his own age, all dressed in"
407,THE NEW LEAVES,"white, like fresh snow. He had very bright eyes, and he looked straight"
408,THE NEW LEAVES,at Tommy.
409,THE NEW LEAVES,
410,THE NEW LEAVES,“Who are you?” asked Tommy.
411,THE NEW LEAVES,
412,THE NEW LEAVES,"“I am the New Year!” said the boy. “This is my day, and I have brought"
413,THE NEW LEAVES,you your leaves.”
414,THE NEW LEAVES,
415,THE NEW LEAVES,“What leaves?” asked Tommy.
416,THE NEW LEAVES,
417,THE NEW LEAVES,"“The new ones, to be sure!” said the New Year. “I hear bad accounts of"
418,THE NEW LEAVES,you from my Daddy—”
419,THE NEW LEAVES,
420,THE NEW LEAVES,“Who is your Daddy?” asked Tommy.
421,THE NEW LEAVES,
422,THE NEW LEAVES,"“The Old Year, of course!” said the boy. “He said you asked too many"
423,THE NEW LEAVES,"questions and I see he was right. He says you are greedy, too, and that"
424,THE NEW LEAVES,"you sometimes pinch your little sister, and that one day you threw"
425,THE NEW LEAVES,"your reader into the fire. Now, all this must stop.”"
426,THE NEW LEAVES,
427,THE NEW LEAVES,"“Oh, must it?” said Tommy. He felt frightened, and did not know just"
428,THE NEW LEAVES,what to say.
429,THE NEW LEAVES,
430,THE NEW LEAVES,"The boy nodded. “If it does not stop,” he said, “you will grow worse"
431,THE NEW LEAVES,"and worse every year, till you grow up into a Horrid Man. Do you want"
432,THE NEW LEAVES,to be a Horrid Man?”
433,THE NEW LEAVES,
434,THE NEW LEAVES,“N-no!” said Tommy.
435,THE NEW LEAVES,
436,THE NEW LEAVES,“Then you must stop being a horrid boy!” said the New Year. “Take your
437,THE NEW LEAVES,"leaves!” and he held out a packet of what looked like copy-book leaves,"
438,THE NEW LEAVES,"all sparkling white, like his own clothes."
439,THE NEW LEAVES,
440,THE NEW LEAVES,"“Turn over one of these every day,” he said, “and soon you will be a"
441,THE NEW LEAVES,good boy instead of a horrid one.”
442,THE NEW LEAVES,
443,THE NEW LEAVES,Tommy took the leaves and looked at them. On each leaf a few words
444,THE NEW LEAVES,"were written. On one it said, “Help your mother!” On another, “Don’t"
445,THE NEW LEAVES,"pull the cat’s tail!” On another, “Don’t eat so much!” And on still"
446,THE NEW LEAVES,"another, “Don’t fight Billy Jenkins!”"
447,THE NEW LEAVES,
448,THE NEW LEAVES,“Oh!” cried Tommy. “I _have_ to fight Billy Jenkins! He said—”
449,THE NEW LEAVES,
450,THE NEW LEAVES,“Good-by!” said the New Year. “I shall come again when I am old to see
451,THE NEW LEAVES,"whether you have been a good boy or a horrid one. Remember,"
452,THE NEW LEAVES,
453,THE NEW LEAVES,“Horrid boy makes horrid man;
454,THE NEW LEAVES,You alone can change the plan.”
455,THE NEW LEAVES,

457,THE NEW LEAVES,
458,THE NEW LEAVES,He turned away and opened the window. A cold wind blew in and swept the
459,THE NEW LEAVES,leaves out of Tommy’s hand. “Stop! stop!” he cried. “Tell me—” But the
460,THE NEW LEAVES,"New Year was gone, and Tommy, staring after him, saw only his mother"
461,THE NEW LEAVES,"coming into the room. “Dear child!” she said. “Why, the wind is blowing"
462,THE NEW LEAVES,everything about.”
463,THE NEW LEAVES,
464,THE NEW LEAVES,“My leaves! My leaves!” cried Tommy; and jumping out of bed he looked
465,THE NEW LEAVES,"all over the room, but he could not find one."
466,THE NEW LEAVES,
467,THE NEW LEAVES,"“Never mind,” said Tommy. “I can turn them just the same, and I mean"

771,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“Do I look nice?” asked the Rabbit.
772,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
773,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“Very nice!” said the Chipmunk; “that is, for a person who has no tail"
774,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"to speak of. But, of course, you cannot help that.”"
775,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
776,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,The Rabbit looked into the looking-glass pond and saw his little white
777,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"blob of a tail. “Don’t you want to lend me yours, just this once?” he"
778,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,asked. “I would take great care of it!”
779,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
780,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“No, I cannot do that,” said the Chipmunk, “but I can lend you the tail"
781,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,of my late uncle. It is such a fine one that we have kept it to brush
782,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,out the nest with.”

784,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“The very thing!” said the Rabbit.
785,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
786,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,So the Chipmunk brought the tail of his late uncle and tied it on to
787,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,the Rabbit’s stub.
788,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
789,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“How does that look?” asked the Rabbit.
790,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
791,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“Fine!” said the Chipmunk. “Now tell me how I look!”
792,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
793,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“Well enough!” said the Rabbit. “Of course, you would look better if"
794,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,you had long ears.”
795,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
796,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“Dear me!” said the Chipmunk; and he, too, looked into the"

798,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
799,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“Why, yes,” said the Rabbit. “There is a pair that belonged to my"

807,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
808,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“Splendid!” said the Rabbit. “Now let us go and make our New Year’s
809,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,calls. Where shall we go first?”
810,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
811,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“I wish to call on Miss Woodchuck!” said the Chipmunk.

813,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“So do I,” said the Rabbit. “We will go there first.” And off they went."
814,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
815,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"They came to Miss Woodchuck’s door and knocked, and she opened the"
816,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"door. “Mercy!” she cried. “Who are you, and what do you want?”"
817,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
818,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"“We are Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Chipmunk,” said the two friends, “and we"
819,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,have come to make you a New Year’s call.”
820,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
821,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“More likely you have come to steal the nuts!” said the lady angrily.

823,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,of them. Who ever heard of a long-tailed rabbit or a long-eared
824,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"squirrel? Get along with you! You are frights, and probably thieves as"
825,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,well.” And she shut the door in their faces.
826,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
827,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,The two friends walked a little way in silence; then they stopped and
828,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,looked at each other.
829,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
830,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“You said I looked fine!” said the Rabbit.
831,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
832,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“I—I meant the tail!” said the Chipmunk. “It is a fine tail. But you
833,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,said I looked splendid!”
834,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
835,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“I was thinking of the ears!” said the Rabbit. “They are splendid ears.”
836,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
837,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,They walked on until they came once more to the looking-glass pond.
838,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"They looked at themselves; then they looked at each other; then, all in"
839,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"a minute, off came the long ears and tail."
840,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
841,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“There!” cried the Chipmunk. “Now we look as we were meant to look; and
842,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"I am bound to say, Rabbit, that it is much more becoming to you.”"
843,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
844,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“So it is to you!” replied the Rabbit. “Now shall we call on Miss
845,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,Woodchuck again?”
846,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
847,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,“Come on!” said the Chipmunk.
848,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,
849,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"So they went to Miss Woodchuck’s house, and knocked once more at the"
850,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"door, and Miss Woodchuck opened it. “Oh!” she cried. “Mr. Chipmunk and"
851,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,"Mr. Rabbit, how do you do? I am so glad to see you. A happy New Year to"
852,NEW YEAR’S DAY IN THE WOOD,you both!”

944,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,Once upon a time there was a donkey who lived in a field where there
945,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"was no pond; so he had never seen his own image, and he thought he was"
946,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,the biggest and strongest and handsomest creature in the world.
947,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
948,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"One day a lion came through the field, and, being a polite beast,"
949,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"stopped to greet the donkey. “Good morning, friend!” he said. “What a"
950,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,fine day this is!”
951,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
952,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“Fine enough, I dare say!” said the donkey. “I never think about the"
953,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,weather. I have other things to think about.”
954,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
955,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,“Indeed!” said the lion. “May I ask what things?”
956,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
957,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,“None of your business!” said the donkey rudely; and he set up a loud
958,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"braying, thinking to frighten the lion away."
959,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
960,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,“Why do you bray?” asked the lion.
961,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
962,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,“Bray!” cried the donkey. “That was not braying—it was roaring!”
963,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
964,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“If you think I don’t know braying from roaring,” said the lion, still"
965,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"politely, “you are mistaken. That was a bray.”"
966,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
967,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,[Illustration]
968,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
969,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“Very well!” shouted the donkey. “If that was, this shall not be!” and"
970,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,he uttered a long and loud “Hee-haw!” and kicked up his heels in angry
971,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,pride. “What do you call that?” he asked proudly.
972,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
973,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“I call it a bray,” replied the lion; “and a very ugly one. You see,"
974,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"after all, you are a donkey; look at the length of your ears!”"
975,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
976,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“How dare you?” cried the donkey. “My ears are the finest in the world,"
977,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"everybody says so. And as for roaring, if I have not scared you yet,"
978,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,just listen to me now!” And flinging up his heels again he bellowed
979,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,till his own long ears tingled with the sound.
980,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
981,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"He expected the lion to be terrified, but the lion merely smiled."
982,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
983,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"“You certainly can make a most hideous noise,” he said; “but when all"
984,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"is said and done, it is only a bray. If you really wish to know how a"
985,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,roar sounds I shall be happy to oblige you.”
986,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
987,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,The King of Beasts then began to lash his tail and pretended to fall
988,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"into a great passion. His eyes flashed fire, his tawny mane bristled;"
989,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"he opened his great mouth, and a roar like thunder filled the air. The"
990,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"donkey, after one terrified look, took to his heels and scampered off"
991,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"as fast as he could go, tumbled into a ditch, and lay there all day,"
992,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,not daring to move for fear.
993,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,
994,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,"The lion went on his way smiling. “It is a pity,” he said, “for a"
995,THE BOASTFUL DONKEY,person to live in a place where he cannot see what he looks like.”

1470,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1471,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1472,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"One day Johnny followed Mamma up into the attic, where there are all"
1473,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"kinds of pleasant things, and he saw a very pleasant thing indeed. It"
1474,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"was a small dish, white with pink roses all over it; really and truly,"
1475,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"it was the prettiest dish that ever was. Johnny said, “O-o-oh! may I"
1476,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,have that dish for mine?”
1477,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1478,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"Mamma looked, and then she took the dish in her hand and thought a"
1479,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,minute. Mamma always likes to be sure about things before she says
1480,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,“Yes!” for fear it might not really be “yes” after all. But now she
1481,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"nodded her head, and said, “Yes, Johnny, you may have it.”"
1482,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1483,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,“O-oh!” said Johnny. “For my welly own?”
1484,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1485,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"“For your very own. The rest of the set is broken, and I have just kept"
1486,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,this dish because it is so pretty. Now you may take it down into the
1487,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"nursery, and have it for a bath for Flora.”"
1488,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1489,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,[Illustration: “NOW HE GAVE HER ONE IN THE ROSY-POSY DISH.”]
1490,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1491,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"Flora was a small doll, all china, and her clothes came off, so she"
1492,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"could have a bath any time, and Johnny often gave her one. Now he gave"
1493,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"her one in the rosy-posy dish, and it was just exactly the right size,"
1494,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"and Johnny was so pleased, and said, “Oh, thank you, _dear_ Mamma!”"
1495,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"without having to be told. (Sometimes he forgets to say “thank you,”"
1496,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,but he is getting to be quite good about it.)
1497,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1498,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"The next time Johnny went down-stairs, he took the doll’s bath to show"
1499,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"to Maggie, and she said ’twas the pick of the world for a dish, and"
1500,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"asked Johnny to lave her bake a cake in it; but Johnny said no, not"
1501,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"now, though perhaps by and by, for now he must take it out to show"
1502,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"to Muffy. Muffet was out in the sand-box, and when Johnny showed her"
1503,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"the dish she mewed and rubbed against his legs, and seemed to want"
1504,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,something very much.
1505,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1506,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"“Maggie,” said Johnny, “Muffy wants something! What do you suppose it"
1507,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,is?”
1508,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1509,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,“Sure she might be wanting a sup o’ milk!” said Maggie. “Bring me here
1510,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"the grand dish and we’ll give the crature a sup in itself, and won’t"
1511,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"she be the proud kitty!” that is the way Maggie talks; it is a nice,"
1512,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"funny way, Johnny thinks."
1513,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1514,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"Well! so Maggie filled the pretty dish with milk, and Johnny set it"
1515,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"down in the sand box before Muffet, and she lapped it up, every single"
1516,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"drop, purring all the time. Johnny was watching her when Mamma called"
1517,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"him in to take his nap. Muffet had not quite finished, so he left the"
1518,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"dish standing, and ran in to Mamma, and then he went for his nap. When"
1519,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"he woke up it was raining hard, and it rained all the afternoon, so he"
1520,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"did not go out again, but stayed in the nursery building a Choo Choo"
1521,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"House. The next morning was bright and clear, and the very first thing"
1522,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"Johnny thought of, when he had had his bath, and Mamma was dressing"
1523,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"him, was the rosy posy dish."
1524,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1525,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"“I wants my diss,” said Johnny, “to give Flora her bath!”"
1526,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1527,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"So Mamma looked for the dish, all over the nursery, but it was not to"
1528,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,be found.
1529,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1530,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"“Where did you leave it, Johnny Boy?” said Mamma. “Think a minute!”"
1531,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1532,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"So Johnny thought a minute, and then he remembered. “I left it in the"
1533,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"sand box,” he said. “Muffy was very thirsty, and she was drinking out"
1534,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"of it, and you called me, and she hadn’t finished, and so, you see—and"
1535,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"so, you see—”"
1536,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1537,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"And Mamma said she saw. Then she looked out of the window, and said"
1538,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"yes, there was the dish, right in the sand box, beside the red tin pail"
1539,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"and the blue tin pail and the old kitchen spoon. Then she said, “Oh!"
1540,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"oh, Johnny, come here and look!”"
1541,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1542,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"So Johnny went to the window, and stood on his tippy-toe-toes, and"
1543,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,looked; and what do you think he saw? A little brown sparrow had come
1544,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"fluttering down, and was drinking out of the rosy posy dish. (You see,"
1545,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"it had rained all night, so the dish was full of water.) He perched on"
1546,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"the edge, and dipped his little beak in, and drank and drank; he must"
1547,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,have been very thirsty. And then—oh! oh! what did he do but hop down
1548,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"_into_ the dish, and begin taking his bath! He splashed, and he shook"
1549,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"himself, and rustled his feathers, and then he splashed again. “Oh!”"
1550,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"said Johnny. “Oh! Mamma, he is doing it all himself. Nobody told him"
1551,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"to, not one bit.”"
1552,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1553,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,[Illustration]
1554,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1555,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"“No, indeed!” said Mamma. “He likes to take his bath and be clean, just"
1556,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,as Johnny does. He knows it feels good to be clean.”
1557,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,
1558,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,“Mamma!” said Johnny. “I want to tell you something. Shall we have
1559,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"something else for Flora, and let the rosy posy dish be the sparrow’s"
1560,MR. SPARROW’S BATH,"bath, his ownty donty?”"

1727,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"“Where are you going in such haste, friend?” said Trusty, the"
1728,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"shepherd’s Dog, to a great wolf that was jogging along the same road."
1729,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1730,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"“If I were sure you would not betray my secret,” said the Wolf, with a"
1731,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"sly leer, “I would let you know.”"
1732,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1733,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"“You need not fear me; I shall tell no one a word of the matter,” said"
1734,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,Trusty.
1735,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1736,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"“Well, then,” said the Wolf, “you must know, as I was prowling around"
1737,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"yonder cottage I saw the farmer’s wife put a fine baby into the cradle,"
1738,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"and heard her say: ‘Lie still, my darling, and go to sleep, while I run"
1739,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,down to the village to buy bread for your father’s supper.’ As soon as
1740,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"the babe is asleep I shall go and fetch it: it is fair and fat, and"
1741,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,will make a nice supper for me and my cubs.”
1742,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1743,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"“Then,” said Trusty, “I would advise you to wait a little longer, for I"
1744,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,saw the baby’s mother step into the next house to speak to a neighbor:
1745,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,take care lest you are seen.”
1746,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1747,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,[Illustration]
1748,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1749,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"The Wolf thanked the Dog for his good advice, for he did not know that"
1750,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,the baby belonged to Trusty’s master; and he said he would take heed
1751,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,and keep close.
1752,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1753,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"Then Trusty ran home with all the speed he could. The door was ajar,"
1754,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,and the innocent baby was fast asleep in the cradle; so he lay down
1755,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,on the mat behind the door and listened for the coming of the Wolf.
1756,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,It was not long before he heard the tread of the Wolf’s feet on the
1757,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"gravel path, and in another minute the savage beast was in the room"
1758,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,and stealing with cautious steps to the cradle; but just as he was
1759,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,preparing to seize the poor baby Trusty sprang upon him and after a
1760,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,fierce struggle laid him dead on the floor.
1761,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,
1762,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,The first thing the mother saw on her return was the Wolf dead at the
1763,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"foot of the cradle, while the baby, unhurt, lay soundly sleeping on his"
1764,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"little pillow, and faithful Trusty watching beside him. She flew to"
1765,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"look the little one all over, to make sure that he was safe and sound,"
1766,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"and then, oh! how she patted and fondled the good Dog who had saved her"
1767,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"darling’s life! She called in all the neighbors, and told them what"
1768,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"Trusty had done, and from that time he became the pet of the whole"
1769,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,"village, and all the mothers wished they had such a dog to watch over"
1770,FAITHFUL TRUSTY,their children.

1780,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"Once a poor Crane was caught in a net, and could not get out. She"
1781,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"fluttered and flapped her wings, but it was of no use, she was held"
1782,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,fast.
1783,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1784,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“Oh!” she cried, “what will become of me if I cannot break this net?"
1785,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"The hunter will come and kill me, or else I shall die of hunger, and"
1786,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,if I die who will care for my poor little young ones in the nest? They
1787,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,must perish also if I do not come back to feed them.”
1788,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1789,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,Now Trusty (the same Trusty who saved the baby’s life) was in the next
1790,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"field and heard the poor Crane’s cries. He jumped over the fence, and"
1791,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,seizing the net in his teeth quickly tore it in pieces. “There!” he
1792,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"said. “Now fly back to your young ones, ma’am, and good luck to you"
1793,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,all!”
1794,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1795,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,The Crane thanked him a thousand times. “I wish all dogs were like
1796,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"you!” she said. “And I wish I could do something to help you, as you"
1797,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,have helped me.”
1798,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1799,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“Who knows?” said Trusty. “Some day I may need help in my turn, and"
1800,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,then you may remember me. My old mother used to say to me:
1801,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1802,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“To do a kind deed wherever we can,"
1803,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,Is good for bird and beast and man.”

1805,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,[Illustration]
1806,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1807,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"Then Trusty went back to mind his master’s sheep, and Mrs. Crane flew"
1808,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,to her nest and fed and tended her crane babies.
1809,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1810,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,Some time after this she was flying homeward and stopped at a clear
1811,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"pool to drink. As she did so she heard a sad, moaning sound, and"
1812,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"looking about, whom should she see but good Trusty, lying on the"
1813,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"ground, almost at the point of death. She flew to him. “Oh, my good,"
1814,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"kind friend,” she cried, “what has happened to you?”"
1815,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1816,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“A bone has stuck in my throat,” said the Dog, “and I am choking to"
1817,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,death.”
1818,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1819,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“Now, thank Heaven for my long bill!” said Mrs. Crane. “Open your"

1821,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1822,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"Trusty opened his mouth wide; the Crane darted in her long, slender"
1823,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"bill, and with a few good tugs loosened the bone and finally got it out."
1824,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1825,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“Oh! you kind, friendly bird!” cried the Dog, as he sprang to his feet"
1826,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,and capered joyfully about. “How shall I ever reward you for saving my
1827,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,life?”
1828,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,
1829,THE GRATEFUL CRANE,"“Did you not save mine first?” said Mrs. Crane. “Shake paws and claws,"

1843,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1844,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“I will be King of the Fen!” said Croaker the Frog, leaping out of the"
1845,THE KING OF THE FEN,brook upon the dry land.
1846,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1847,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“You King, indeed!” said Slyboots, a fine, fat Field Mouse with a long"
1848,THE KING OF THE FEN,"tail and bright eyes, jumping out of his hole at the foot of a hazel"
1849,THE KING OF THE FEN,"bush which grew near. “I am larger than you, and I will be King, and"
1850,THE KING OF THE FEN,the frogs shall be my subjects and cut rushes and bring me dry moss to
1851,THE KING OF THE FEN,line my nest.” And Slyboots strutted about and gave himself a great
1852,THE KING OF THE FEN,many airs.
1853,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1854,THE KING OF THE FEN,[Illustration]
1855,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1856,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“I will never consent to be ruled by a Mouse,” replied the Frog with a"
1857,THE KING OF THE FEN,disdainful air. “How finely King Slyboots would sound!”
1858,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1859,THE KING OF THE FEN,“Quite as well as King Croaker!” retorted the Mouse.
1860,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1861,THE KING OF THE FEN,Then the Frog flew into a great passion and hopped so high and croaked
1862,THE KING OF THE FEN,"so loud that the Mouse crept a little farther from him (for frogs, like"
1863,THE KING OF THE FEN,"children, look very ugly when they are out of temper); and Slyboots did"
1864,THE KING OF THE FEN,"not much like the idea of being touched by his cold paws, and he said"
1865,THE KING OF THE FEN,to himself: “In spite of this Frog’s looking so fierce and talking so
1866,THE KING OF THE FEN,loud I should not wonder if he were a coward at heart.”
1867,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1868,THE KING OF THE FEN,So he turned to the Frog and said: “As we both wish to be King of the
1869,THE KING OF THE FEN,"Fen I know of no way of ending the dispute but by fighting, and the one"
1870,THE KING OF THE FEN,that wins the fight shall be King over the other.”
1871,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1872,THE KING OF THE FEN,Then the Frog said: “Very well! We will each bring a friend to see fair
1873,THE KING OF THE FEN,play. To-morrow at twelve o’clock I shall be ready to take the field;
1874,THE KING OF THE FEN,"and if you fail to meet me here I shall be King of the Fen, and the"
1875,THE KING OF THE FEN,mice shall be my servants.” For Croaker thought Slyboots was braver
1876,THE KING OF THE FEN,"in word than in deed, as cowards are often the foremost to talk of"
1877,THE KING OF THE FEN,fighting.
1878,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1879,THE KING OF THE FEN,Then the Frog retired among the bulrushes and the Mouse ran home to his
1880,THE KING OF THE FEN,hole under the nut tree.
1881,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1882,THE KING OF THE FEN,The two rivals awoke next morning by break of day to prepare for the
1883,THE KING OF THE FEN,"combat, which was to take place at noon. The Frog was very much afraid"
1884,THE KING OF THE FEN,"of Slyboots’s sharp teeth and claws, so he fell to work and made a"
1885,THE KING OF THE FEN,"shield from the bark of an old willow tree, and then he plucked a long"
1886,THE KING OF THE FEN,"bulrush for a spear. “Now,” said he, “I am well armed: I have a shield"
1887,THE KING OF THE FEN,to defend myself and a spear to attack the enemy with. If I had but a
1888,THE KING OF THE FEN,brave friend to be my second in the fight I should do very well.”
1889,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1890,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“I will be your second,” said a great Pike, raising his head above the"
1891,THE KING OF THE FEN,"water; “I will lie close to the bank among these rushes, and if you"
1892,THE KING OF THE FEN,break your spear come to me and I will procure you another.”
1893,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1894,THE KING OF THE FEN,The Frog was well pleased at this offer. “I shall beat Slyboots in a
1895,THE KING OF THE FEN,"little time,” said he, “with such weapons and so good a friend.”"
1896,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1897,THE KING OF THE FEN,Slyboots in the meantime was not idle; he sharpened his teeth and his
1898,THE KING OF THE FEN,claws and chose a light twig from the hazel bush and said: “I only want
1899,THE KING OF THE FEN,"now a friend to be my second and see fair play.” A great Hawk, which"
1900,THE KING OF THE FEN,"was hovering near, said: “Mr. Slyboots, you may command my services at"
1901,THE KING OF THE FEN,any hour you please to name.”
1902,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1903,THE KING OF THE FEN,"Now Slyboots was somewhat afraid of the Hawk, for he thought he had"
1904,THE KING OF THE FEN,"rather a hungry look about the eyes and beak, but he dared not refuse"
1905,THE KING OF THE FEN,his offer lest he should give offence; so he thanked him for his
1906,THE KING OF THE FEN,"kindness, and at the appointed hour they went to the spot where the"
1907,THE KING OF THE FEN,Frog was waiting for them. The Pike lay in the hole among the rushes
1908,THE KING OF THE FEN,and the Hawk sat on the bough of a tree close by.
1909,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1910,THE KING OF THE FEN,[Illustration: “THE BATTLE WAS LONG AND FIERCE ON BOTH SIDES.”]
1911,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1912,THE KING OF THE FEN,The Frog and the Mouse looked at one another for a few minutes and
1913,THE KING OF THE FEN,shook their weapons. At last the Hawk and the Pike gave signal for the
1914,THE KING OF THE FEN,"fight to begin. The battle was long and fierce on both sides, and for"
1915,THE KING OF THE FEN,some time it was doubtful which would win. At last the Frog seemed to
1916,THE KING OF THE FEN,"gain ground, but at the very minute that he seemed to be winning his"
1917,THE KING OF THE FEN,spear broke in pieces.
1918,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1919,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“Alas!” croaked he in a tone of dismay, “what shall I do? Who will give"
1920,THE KING OF THE FEN,me another weapon?”
1921,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1922,THE KING OF THE FEN,"“Here is one,” cried his friend, the Pike, from among the rushes."
1923,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1924,THE KING OF THE FEN,"The Frog gave a leap of joy and sprang toward the Pike, who, opening"
1925,THE KING OF THE FEN,"his mouth, quickly put an end to the battle by swallowing the hapless"
1926,THE KING OF THE FEN,Frog at one mouthful.
1927,THE KING OF THE FEN,
1928,THE KING OF THE FEN,“I am King of the Fen now!” cried Slyboots with a joyful squeak. “Long
1929,THE KING OF THE FEN,live your Majesty!” exclaimed the crafty Hawk. As he spoke he darted
1930,THE KING OF THE FEN,"from the tree and, pouncing upon the new monarch, bore him away in his"
1931,THE KING OF THE FEN,claws and put an end to his reign and his life at the same moment.

1984,THE TREES,
1985,THE TREES,“What will you wear?” they all said to the little Fir.
1986,THE TREES,

1989,THE TREES,

1993,THE TREES,
1994,THE TREES,But the old Pine waved his dark branches and said: “Hush! hush! I know

1996,THE TREES,
1997,THE TREES,"“We know, too,” cried the Maples. “We know that in snow-time Santa"

2001,THE TREES,
2002,THE TREES,“Hush! hush!” said the old Pine. “I know what I know.”
2003,THE TREES,

2007,THE TREES,
2008,THE TREES,"Now it grew cold, and a bleak wind blew through the forest. The trees"
2009,THE TREES,shivered and drew their bright robes close around them. Colder still it
2010,THE TREES,"grew, and snow fell, and the wind moaned; one day Jack Frost came in"
2011,THE TREES,"his silver coat and touched the bright leaves with his shining brush,"
2012,THE TREES,"and they curled up and turned brown, and, one by one, fell rustling"
2013,THE TREES,to the ground. Soon the poor Maples and Birches and the purple Ash who
2014,THE TREES,"thought he looked like a King stood all bare, and the wind blew through"
2015,THE TREES,"their branches, and they shook with the cold. They looked at the Fir"
2016,THE TREES,"and wished that they had her warm, green dress. Now came Santa Claus,"
2017,THE TREES,"driving his reindeer team through the forest, cracking his whip and"
2018,THE TREES,jingling his bells. He looked at the trees with his bright eyes.

2136,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"Once upon a time in a deep wood lived a Deer and a Crow, who were great"
2137,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"friends and loved each other dearly. One day, as the Deer was roaming"
2138,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"about alone, he met Small-Wit, the Jackal."
2139,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2140,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"Small-Wit was hungry, and when he saw the fine fat Deer he said to"
2141,THE DEER AND THE CROW,himself: “Oho! if only I could have this fat Deer for my supper!” So he
2142,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"went up to the Deer, hanging his head and looking very sad."
2143,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2144,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Who are you, Friend?” asked the Deer, “and why do you look so sad?”"
2145,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2146,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“My name is Small-Wit,” said the Jackal; “and I am sad because I have"
2147,THE DEER AND THE CROW,not a friend in the world. Ah! if I could win your friendship how happy
2148,THE DEER AND THE CROW,I should be!”
2149,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2150,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Very well,” said the Deer, who was very good-natured. “Come with me,"
2151,THE DEER AND THE CROW,and we will be friends.”
2152,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2153,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"He led the way to his home, and the Jackal followed him. As they"

2156,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2157,THE DEER AND THE CROW,[Illustration]
2158,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2159,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“It is Small-Wit, the Jackal,” said the Deer. “He is lonely, and wishes"

2165,THE DEER AND THE CROW,said the Crow.
2166,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2167,THE DEER AND THE CROW,“Nay!” said the Deer. “I like this rhyme better:
2168,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2169,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Foe is friend, and friend is foe,"
2170,THE DEER AND THE CROW,As our actions make them so.”
2171,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2172,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Very good,” said Sharp-Sense: “as you will.”"
2173,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2174,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"Next morning they went off hunting, and the Jackal said to the Deer: “I"
2175,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"know a field of sweet corn, and I will take you there.”"
2176,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2177,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"So the Deer followed Small-Wit, and, sure enough, they came to a field"
2178,THE DEER AND THE CROW,of sweet young corn.
2179,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2180,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“You are a friend indeed!” cried the Deer, and he feasted till suddenly"
2181,THE DEER AND THE CROW,he fell into a snare which the farmer had laid.
2182,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2183,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Alas!” cried the Deer, “Friend Small-Wit, here am I caught by the"
2184,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"feet, and cannot move. Come, I pray you, and gnaw these cords with your"
2185,THE DEER AND THE CROW,sharp teeth and set me free!”
2186,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2187,THE DEER AND THE CROW,The Jackal came and looked at the snare. “That will hold you fast
2188,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"enough,” he said. “To-day is a fast day, but to-morrow I will have a"
2189,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"fine feast on your fat carcass, my foolish friend.” And off he went."
2190,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2191,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"Presently came along Sharp-Sense, the Crow, who had been looking for"
2192,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"his friend. “Alas!” he cried, “how did this happen, Friend Deer?”"
2193,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2194,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Through not minding what you said,” replied the Deer."
2195,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2196,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"“Well,” said the Crow, “we must do what we can. Here comes the farmer."
2197,THE DEER AND THE CROW,Do you lie still and pretend to be dead until I croak: then spring up
2198,THE DEER AND THE CROW,and be off.”
2199,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2200,THE DEER AND THE CROW,The farmer came along and saw our friend lying perfectly still. “Aha!”
2201,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"he cried, “this fellow will eat no more of my corn.”"
2202,THE DEER AND THE CROW,
2203,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"He stooped down and untied the cords of the snare, meaning to carry off"
2204,THE DEER AND THE CROW,the dead Deer; but at that moment the Crow gave a loud “Caw!” Up sprang
2205,THE DEER AND THE CROW,the Deer and in a moment was safe in the forest. The farmer flung a
2206,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"club after him; it hit Small-Wit, the Jackal, who was lurking near"
2207,THE DEER AND THE CROW,"by hoping to have a share of the spoil, and killed him; and the two"

2218,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"In a southern garden lived a family of green lizards, under the roots"
2219,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"of a palm-tree. They were merry little creatures, and their parents"
2220,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,loved them dearly.
2221,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2222,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,One day Father Lizard said to his children: “Your mother and I must go
2223,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"away this morning; now be good children; stay close together, and be"
2224,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,sure that one of you keeps watch for fear of snakes and hawks!”
2225,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2226,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,The little lizards promised; and for some time they were very careful;
2227,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"first one kept watch, and then another; but at length Sprightly said:"
2228,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"“There is no danger near. Why should we not all play together, just for"
2229,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,a little while?”
2230,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2231,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"Oh dear! they forgot their promise, and see what came of it! While they"
2232,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"were playing merrily, a great snake glided quietly out from the grass,"
2233,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"seized poor Sprightly, and carried her off to his den."
2234,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2235,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"The other lizards fled in terror. Swiftfoot ran up the tree, Longtail"
2236,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"hid in the nest, and Goldstar ran away and away, to the farthest end"
2237,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"of the garden. She did not dare to go home again, but found a hole in"
2238,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"the bank near a summerhouse, and slipping into it, stayed all night,"
2239,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,weeping for the death of her dear Sprightly.
2240,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2241,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"Next day she tried to find her way home, but the garden was large, and"
2242,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,she was too afraid of snakes to go far; so she decided to stay where
2243,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"she was, and make her home in the hole by the summerhouse."
2244,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2245,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"One day, as she was lying in the sun, Goldstar saw a boy standing near"
2246,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"her, with a cane in his hand. At first she was afraid to move, fearing"
2247,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,he might strike her; but Carlos (for that was the boy’s name) was fond
2248,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"of lizards, and would not have hurt one for the world. He spoke softly"
2249,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"to Goldstar, and she soon saw that he was kind and good. He stroked"
2250,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"her gently, first with a green leaf, then with his hand, and Goldstar"
2251,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"lay still, and was not afraid any more."
2252,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2253,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"They became great friends, and Carlos came every day to see his pretty"
2254,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"lizard and play with her. One day, as he was coming down the garden"
2255,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"walk, he saw a large hawk hovering in the air near the summerhouse,"
2256,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,just about to dart down on something. “Oh! my lizard! my lizard!” cried
2257,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"Carlos; and he ran as fast as he could to the spot, shouting and waving"
2258,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"his arms. The hawk flew screaming away, and Goldstar ran to Carlos, and"
2259,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"crept inside his jacket. She could not speak, but he knew that she was"
2260,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"glad, and perhaps was trying to thank him in her own way."
2261,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2262,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"One very hot day, Carlos was taking a nap in the summerhouse, when"
2263,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,he was waked by something running over his face. He brushed it away
2264,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"without opening his eyes, but it came again, and still again. In fact,"
2265,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"he could not get rid of it. At last he sat up, wide awake and very"
2266,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"angry, and found that it was Goldstar. He tried to shake her off, but"
2267,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"she ran into his bosom. He was going to pull her out in a pet, when,"
2268,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"looking down, he saw a large snake, with head raised and glittering"
2269,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"eyes, gliding slowly toward him. He knew its bite was fatal, and he"
2270,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"sprang up with a loud cry. The snake stopped, and then turning, glided"
2271,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,away into the bushes.
2272,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2273,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,[Illustration]
2274,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,
2275,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"Very gently, Carlos drew his little pet from his bosom, and stroked her"
2276,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"green and golden back. “Dear Goldstar,” he said, “if I saved you from"
2277,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,"the hawk, you have saved me from the serpent. I will love you and take"
2278,LITTLE GOLDSTAR,care of you as long as you live.” And so he did.

2324,THE CLEVER CROWS,"A pair of crows had their nest in a certain tree. It was a fine tree,"
2325,THE CLEVER CROWS,"and suited them well, but they had a bad neighbor, a black snake, who"
2326,THE CLEVER CROWS,often stole and ate their young ones.
2327,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2328,THE CLEVER CROWS,"“Husband,” said Mrs. Crow, “we must leave this pleasant home of ours;"
2329,THE CLEVER CROWS,we shall never be able to rear our children while that bad snake is
2330,THE CLEVER CROWS,there.”
2331,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2332,THE CLEVER CROWS,"“My dear,” replied Mr. Crow, “think no more about him. I have had"
2333,THE CLEVER CROWS,"enough of Black Snake, and I am going to get rid of him.”"
2334,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2335,THE CLEVER CROWS,“What can you do against a huge snake like that?” asked Mrs. Crow.
2336,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2337,THE CLEVER CROWS,"“Listen!” said Mr. Crow. “As you know, the Prince comes every day to"
2338,THE CLEVER CROWS,"bathe in the fountain under our tree. He has a fine gold chain, and he"
2339,THE CLEVER CROWS,"takes it off before he goes into the water, and lays it on a stone."
2340,THE CLEVER CROWS,"To-morrow, when he does this, do you take the chain in your beak (for I"
2341,THE CLEVER CROWS,"shall be away getting food for the babies), and drop it into the hollow"
2342,THE CLEVER CROWS,"of the tree, taking care to give some good loud ‘Caws’ while you do so."
2343,THE CLEVER CROWS,Then wait and see what happens!”
2344,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2345,THE CLEVER CROWS,"Sure enough, next morning the young Prince came as usual to bathe in"
2346,THE CLEVER CROWS,"the clear fountain. He took off his gold chain and laid it on a stone,"
2347,THE CLEVER CROWS,just as Mr. Crow said he would; then he began to take off his robes.
2348,THE CLEVER CROWS,"Just then down flew Mrs. Crow, took the chain in her yellow bill, and"
2349,THE CLEVER CROWS,flew up into the branches with it. “Oh! my chain! my chain!” cried the
2350,THE CLEVER CROWS,Prince. “That crow has flown away with it!”
2351,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2352,THE CLEVER CROWS,"“Have peace, your Highness!” replied his servant. “The bird has not"
2353,THE CLEVER CROWS,flown far; she has this instant dropped the chain into a hole in the
2354,THE CLEVER CROWS,"tree, and I will climb up and get it.”"
2355,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2356,THE CLEVER CROWS,"Up climbed the servant, and looked down into the hole."
2357,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2358,THE CLEVER CROWS,“Do you see my chain?” cried the Prince.
2359,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2360,THE CLEVER CROWS,"“Yes,” said the servant, “I see it, shining in the hole, but I see"
2361,THE CLEVER CROWS,something else that is not so pretty; the head of a great ugly black
2362,THE CLEVER CROWS,"snake. If your Highness will throw me up a stone, I will kill the"
2363,THE CLEVER CROWS,"creature, for it is a poisonous snake.”"
2364,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2365,THE CLEVER CROWS,[Illustration]
2366,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2367,THE CLEVER CROWS,"So the Prince threw up a stone, and the servant caught it, and killed"
2368,THE CLEVER CROWS,"the snake with it. Then he reached down into the hole, pulled out the"
2369,THE CLEVER CROWS,"gold chain, and took it back to his master, who thanked him kindly."
2370,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2371,THE CLEVER CROWS,“Ah!” said Mrs. Crow. “He is glad to get back his fine jewel; but I am

2374,THE CLEVER CROWS,for supper to-night.”
2375,THE CLEVER CROWS,
2376,THE CLEVER CROWS,"So she did! I do not know what crows like best for supper, so I cannot"

2624,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2625,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"There are many old, old stories about the dear Christ Child when he was"
2626,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"little. Not all of them are true, but all are sweet and lovely; listen"
2627,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"now, and you shall hear one."
2628,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2629,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"It had been raining in Nazareth, and the ground, which had long been"
2630,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"parched and dry, was turned to wet clay. This was a wonderful thing"
2631,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"for the children, and they all ran to play with the clay, just as you"
2632,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"boys and girls do now. Some dug canals and wells, some built houses"
2633,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,and towers; while others took the soft clay in their hands and moulded
2634,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,it into shapes of men and animals. The little Jesus joined this last
2635,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"group, and while they made dogs and cats, horses and lions, he made"
2636,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"little gray doves, and set them one by one on the edge of the fountain."
2637,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2638,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"Presently sweet Mary the Mother came to the door and looked out, to see"
2639,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,what the children were doing.
2640,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2641,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“See!” cried one little boy. “Mary Mother, see my dog! he can almost"

2643,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2644,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“Look at my lion!” cried another. “He is so big and strong, he could"
2645,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,eat up your dog in a minute.”
2646,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2647,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“Ho!” said a third. “My man here could whip your dog, and kill your"

2649,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2650,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"Mary Mother smiled, and praised the dog, the lion, and the man. Then"
2651,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"she said, “And what has my little Jesus to show me?”"
2652,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2653,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“I have made some little gray doves,” said Jesus. “See! here they are!”"
2654,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2655,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“And what can they do, my little one?” asked sweet Mary, as she"
2656,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,stroked the boy’s curly head.
2657,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2658,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"“I think they can fly!” said little Jesus. “Fly, pretty doves!”"
2659,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,
2660,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"He clapped his hands, and up flew the doves like a soft gray cloud."
2661,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"Then fluttered round the child’s fair head, and lighted for a moment on"
2662,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,his shoulders and his hands; then they spread their gray wings and flew
2663,THE LITTLE GRAY DOVES,"up into the sky, and were seen no more."

2685,MERRY CHRISTMAS,say one cross word all day; I heard them tell their mother so.”
2686,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2687,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"“I was in the nursery this morning,” said Little Cat. “The children’s"
2688,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"stockings were full of toys and sugar-plums, and they kissed each other"
2689,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"and said, ‘Merry’—something! What can it all mean?”"
2690,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2691,MERRY CHRISTMAS,[Illustration]
2692,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2693,MERRY CHRISTMAS,“Let us ask Great Old Dog!” said Little Dog. “He knows almost

2695,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2696,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"Great Old Dog was asleep, but he woke up and heard their story"
2697,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"patiently. “It was ‘Merry Christmas!’ that the children said,” he told"
2698,MERRY CHRISTMAS,them. “This is Christmas Day.”
2699,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2700,MERRY CHRISTMAS,“What does it mean?” asked Little Cat.
2701,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2702,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"“I don’t understand all about it,” said Great Old Dog; “but it is the"
2703,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"best day in the whole year, for everybody is happy and kind, and tries"
2704,MERRY CHRISTMAS,to do pleasant things for everybody else. I think some one was born who
2705,MERRY CHRISTMAS,brought kindness into the world.”
2706,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2707,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"“Well,” said Little Dog; “if everybody is going to be good we must be"
2708,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"good, too. Little Cat, I will not growl at you once to-day, even if"
2709,MERRY CHRISTMAS,they put our dinner on the same plate!”
2710,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2711,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"“Nor I at you,” said Little Cat, “even if there is only one cushion by"

2713,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2714,MERRY CHRISTMAS,“Nice Little Cat!” said Little Dog.
2715,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2716,MERRY CHRISTMAS,“Good Little Dog!” said Little Cat.
2717,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2718,MERRY CHRISTMAS,Just then in came Little Girl in her blue dress and Little Boy in his
2719,MERRY CHRISTMAS,velvet jacket. “Merry Christmas!” they cried: “Little Cat and Little
2720,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"Dog, and dear, good Great Old Dog!”"
2721,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2722,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"“We wish you Merry Christmas,"
2723,MERRY CHRISTMAS,And a happy New Year;
2724,MERRY CHRISTMAS,"A pocket full of money,"
2725,MERRY CHRISTMAS,And a heart full of cheer!”
2726,MERRY CHRISTMAS,
2727,MERRY CHRISTMAS,“Merry Christmas!” said Little Dog (but it sounded like “Yap! yap!”).

2731,MERRY CHRISTMAS,

2743,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2744,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"“Dear,” said his mother, “I have no money. We are very poor, and I can"
2745,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,hardly buy food for us all.”
2746,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2747,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,Jack hung his head; if he had not been ten the tears would have come to
2748,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"his eyes, but he was ten."
2749,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2750,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“All the other boys give presents!” he said.
2751,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2752,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“So shall you!” said his mother. “All presents are not bought with
2753,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"money. The best boy that ever lived was as poor as we are, and yet he"
2754,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,was always giving.”
2755,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2756,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Who was he?” asked Jack; “and what did he give?”
2757,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2758,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"“This is his birthday,” said the mother. “He was the good Jesus. He was"
2759,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"born in a stable, and he lived in a poor workingman’s house. He never"
2760,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"had a penny of his own, yet he gave twelve good gifts every day. Would"
2761,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,you like to try his way?”
2762,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2763,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Yes!” cried Jack.
2764,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2765,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"So his mother told him this and that; and soon after Jack started out,"
2766,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"dressed in his best suit, to give his presents."
2767,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2768,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"First, he went to Aunt Jane’s house. She was old and lame and she did"
2769,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,not like boys.
2770,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2771,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“What do you want?” she asked as she opened the door.
2772,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2773,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Merry Christmas!” said Jack. “May I stay for an hour and help you?”
2774,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2775,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. “Want to keep you out of mischief, do they?"
2776,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,Well! you may bring in some wood.”
2777,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2778,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"“Shall I split some kindling, too?” asked Jack."
2779,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2780,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“If you know how!” said Aunt Jane. “I can’t have you cutting your foot
2781,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,and messing my clean shed all up.”
2782,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2783,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"Jack found some fresh pine wood and a bright hatchet, and he split up"
2784,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"a great pile of kindling and thought it fun. He stacked it neatly, and"
2785,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,then he brought in a pail of water and filled the kettle.
2786,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2787,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“What else can I do?” he asked. “There are twenty minutes more.”
2788,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2789,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,[Illustration]
2790,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2791,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. “You might feed the pig.”
2792,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2793,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"Jack fed the pig, who thanked him in his own way."
2794,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2795,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Ten minutes more!” he said. “What shall I do now?”
2796,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2797,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. “You may sit down and tell me why you came.”
2798,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2799,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“It is a Christmas present!” said Jack. “I am giving hours for
2800,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"presents. I had twelve, but I gave one to Mother, and another one was"
2801,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,gone before I knew I had it. This hour was your present.”
2802,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2803,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Humph!” said Aunt Jane. She hobbled to the cupboard and took out a
2804,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,small round pie that smelt very good. “Here!” she said. “This is _your_
2805,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"present, and I thank you for mine. Come again, will you?”"
2806,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2807,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"“Indeed I will!” said Jack, “and thank you for the pie!”"
2808,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2809,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"Next Jack went and read for an hour to old Mr. Green, who was blind."
2810,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"He read a book about the sea, and they both liked it very much, so the"
2811,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"hour went quickly. Then it was time to help Mother get dinner, and then"
2812,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"time to eat it; that took two hours, and Aunt Jane’s pie was wonderful."
2813,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"Then Jack took the Smith baby for a ride in its carriage, as Mrs. Smith"
2814,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"was ill, and they met its grandfather, who filled Jack’s pockets with"
2815,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,candy and popcorn and invited him to a Christmas Tree that night.
2816,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2817,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"Next Jack went to see Willy Brown, who had been ill for a long time and"
2818,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,could not leave his bed. Willy was very glad to see him; they played a
2819,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"game, and then each told the other a story, and before Jack knew it the"
2820,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,clock struck six.
2821,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2822,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Oh!” cried Jack. “You have had two!”
2823,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,
2824,CHRISTMAS GIFTS,“Two what?” asked Willy.

3057,DICK’S FAMILY,"so we had always supposed: a large black bachelor, with bright green"
3058,DICK’S FAMILY,"eyes, and a very fine tail. He lived in the kitchen, and managed things"
3059,DICK’S FAMILY,"pretty much as he pleased. When Peter, the new puppy, came he thought"
3060,DICK’S FAMILY,it would be fun to tease Dick. Dick thought it would be fun to be
3061,DICK’S FAMILY,"teased, and when he had sent Peter yelping and ki-yi-ing out into the"

3068,DICK’S FAMILY,and mewed as if he were calling some one to follow him. And some one

3070,DICK’S FAMILY,
3071,DICK’S FAMILY,One very thin and wretched-looking tortoise-shell cat.
3072,DICK’S FAMILY,
3073,DICK’S FAMILY,One Maltese kitten.

3084,DICK’S FAMILY,
3085,DICK’S FAMILY,"They came on, though still very timidly, till they reached the barn."
3086,DICK’S FAMILY,"Then Dick took them under the barn and there he made them comfortable,"
3087,DICK’S FAMILY,"we do not know just how, because we cannot get under the barn, and"
3088,DICK’S FAMILY,there they stayed. And when Dick came for his supper he said to Maggie
3089,DICK’S FAMILY,"as plain as mew could speak, “Please feed my family, too!” and Maggie"
3090,DICK’S FAMILY,did.
