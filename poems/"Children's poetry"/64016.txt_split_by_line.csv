47,EIGHT O’CLOCK,Jeanette is not a sleepy-head;
48,EIGHT O’CLOCK,"An easy task, to wake her!"
49,EIGHT O’CLOCK,At eight o’clock she springs from bed--
50,EIGHT O’CLOCK,No need to call or shake her.
51,EIGHT O’CLOCK,Her brother Jean--I grieve to state--
52,EIGHT O’CLOCK,His patient _bonne_ distresses;
53,EIGHT O’CLOCK,’Tis often nearer nine than eight
54,EIGHT O’CLOCK,Before at last he dresses.

64,NINE O’CLOCK,For _déjeuner_ our children eat
65,NINE O’CLOCK,A bowl of milk and bit of bread;
66,NINE O’CLOCK,"Or sometimes, for a special treat,"
67,NINE O’CLOCK,"A _croissant_, crisp and fresh, instead."
68,NINE O’CLOCK,"Jeanette displays her bringing up,"
69,NINE O’CLOCK,For daintily she sips and lingers.
70,NINE O’CLOCK,"Her brother drains his brimming cup,"
71,NINE O’CLOCK,"And then--oh, horror!--licks his fingers!"

82,TEN O’CLOCK,Bringing books and dreadful sums.
83,TEN O’CLOCK,"Jeanette’s patience never fails,"
84,TEN O’CLOCK,But Jean his lesson-time bewails.
85,TEN O’CLOCK,For boys have better things to do
86,TEN O’CLOCK,Than multiplying two by two!

96,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,The Luxembourg is a jolly place
97,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,"To roll your hoop, and to run a race"
98,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,"With a gallant yacht, and win, of course,"
99,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,Or caper about on a mettled horse!
100,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,And your heart is gay and your cheeks are bright--
101,ELEVEN O’CLOCK,And home you go with an appetite!

111,TWELVE O’CLOCK,"Luncheon never comes too soon,"
112,TWELVE O’CLOCK,For we are nearly starved at noon!
113,TWELVE O’CLOCK,"Spinach and an omelette,"
114,TWELVE O’CLOCK,"Salad, too, and better yet"
115,TWELVE O’CLOCK,Delicious jam with creamy cheese--
116,TWELVE O’CLOCK,A dish that’s very sure to please!
117,TWELVE O’CLOCK,"Becoming gratitude they feel,"
118,TWELVE O’CLOCK,And thank _le bon Dieu_ for their meal.

129,THIRTEEN O’CLOCK,They nap at one;
130,THIRTEEN O’CLOCK,"Truth to tell,"
131,THIRTEEN O’CLOCK,The two rebel.
132,THIRTEEN O’CLOCK,"Sleep was made for night, they say,"
133,THIRTEEN O’CLOCK,And never for a sunny day!

143,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,We think it quite a jolly lark
144,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,To go a-riding in the park.
145,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,"Jeanette’s mount is safe and sure,"
146,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,Upon his back she sits secure.
147,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,"But Jean--another matter, quite!"
148,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,His steed is proud and full of fight.
149,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,“_Oo-là-là!_” His _bonne_ cries out--
150,FOURTEEN O’CLOCK,“You’ll break your neck without a doubt!”

160,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Every perfect Frenchman’s heart
161,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Thrills in keen response to Art.
162,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Great his rapture when he sees a
163,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Venus or a Mona Lisa;
164,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,And incomplete his education
165,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Lacking Art Appreciation.
166,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,So our pair must learn to know
167,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,"Da Vinci, Titian and Corot."
168,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,Their teacher knows the surest way:
169,FIFTEEN O’CLOCK,She takes them to the Louvre each day.

179,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,"Feet were made to dance on, truly;"
180,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,But Jean’s too often are unruly.
181,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,Now a dip and now a slide--
182,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,Watch the graceful Jeanette glide!
183,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,"High upon her tippy-toes,"
184,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,Light as gentlest breeze that blows.
185,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,Now a slip and now a stumble--
186,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,See her brother trip and tumble
187,SIXTEEN O’CLOCK,Flat upon his nose!

197,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,At five o’clock we take our tea;
198,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,Lighted candles on the table.
199,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,"Sister dainty as can be,"
200,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,And Brother good as he is able.
201,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,"But he is generous through and through,"
202,SEVENTEEN O’CLOCK,And gives Minette a bite or two.

212,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,After tea it’s very jolly
213,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,To play with train and Mistress Dolly.
214,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,"Over mountains, under tunnels,"
215,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,Roaring flames and smoking funnels--
216,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,Hear the engine clank and clatter!
217,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,Drowning Jeanette’s quiet chatter
218,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,As she hugs her dolly tight
219,EIGHTEEN O’CLOCK,And makes her ready for the night.

230,NINETEEN O’CLOCK,There are lessons to be done.
231,NINETEEN O’CLOCK,"But oh, how hard to concentrate"
232,NINETEEN O’CLOCK,On three from six and five times eight
233,NINETEEN O’CLOCK,"When there’s a train upon the floor,"
234,NINETEEN O’CLOCK,And bandits lurking by the door!

245,TWENTY O’CLOCK,Hastens by as if on wings.
246,TWENTY O’CLOCK,It seems you scarce have gotten up
247,TWENTY O’CLOCK,"Before it’s time again to sup,"
248,TWENTY O’CLOCK,"And say your prayers, and go to bed,"
249,TWENTY O’CLOCK,And dream of happiness ahead.
