47,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Punky Dunk, so fat, was a black and white cat"
48,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Of exceedingly tender years.
49,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"He had black on his nose and the tips of his toes,"
50,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,On the end of his tail and his ears.
51,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
52,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
53,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
54,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,He cast his lot in a very soft spot
55,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"For his bed was a box full of straw,"
56,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And he slept all night with his eyes shut tight
57,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And his little black nose on his paw.
58,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
59,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
60,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
61,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Punky Dunk would peep, though he seemed asleep,"
62,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"At the bird in its cage of brass,"
63,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And his tail he swayed when the gold fish played
64,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,In their clear little bowl of glass.
65,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
66,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
67,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
68,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""Though my coat's like silk from my drinking milk,"""
69,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"He would say, ""I often wish"
70,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,I might change my food----as I think I should----
71,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"To a meal on a nice plump fish."""
72,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
73,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
74,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
75,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"So he winked his eye and he heaved a sigh,"
76,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And he said: ""I really think"
77,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,That it would be grand to jump on that stand
78,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And see how the fishes drink."""
79,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
80,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
81,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
82,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,The fish globe round he reached with a bound
83,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And stood with his paws on the rim
84,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Looking in with an air that was certain to scare
85,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,The fish as they looked at him.
86,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
87,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
88,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
89,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,His cunning head bent and his little nose went
90,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"Right down, while his tongue flashed red----"
91,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"When, O, what a sight! The fish in their fright"
92,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Splashed water all over his head.
93,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
94,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
95,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
96,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And Punky Dunk howled and Punky Dunk yowled
97,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"And Punky Dunk fell to the floor,"
98,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,And he bristled and spat like a terrified cat
99,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,As he fled through the dining room door.
100,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
101,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
102,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
103,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"In the big glass bowl, when the waves ceased to roll"
104,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,All the little gold fish were so glad
105,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,That each wiggled his fins as he said through his grins:
106,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""That's the most fun we ever have had."""
107,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
108,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,[Illustration]
109,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,
110,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,Now Punky Dunk lies on the floor and he sighs:
111,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"""It is best for a cat to be good,"
112,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,For I cannot forget how I got my coat wet
113,ALL RIGHTS RESERVED,"When I didn't do just as I should."""
