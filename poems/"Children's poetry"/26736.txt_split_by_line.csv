60,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","I dedicate this book to you, my dearest dears, with more love than I"
61,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","have ink to write out, and more good wishes and fond hopes than any"
62,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",printer would care to print.
63,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",
64,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",You will see by these stories that the children of different countries
65,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","are pretty much alike.  I doubt not, if you were in France now, you"
66,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","would get along nicely with the little Monsieurs and Mademoiselles,"
67,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","after some coy hanging back and reconnoitring,--that is, if you only"
68,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","knew their ""lingo.""  So with the little Signors and Signorinas of"
69,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Italy, and the small Dons and Donnas of Spain.  You would find the"
70,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Dutch boys and girls, who look so sober and quaint, like men and women"
71,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","cut short, to be real children after all.  If you should visit Turkey,"
72,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",you would find the little Turks and Turkesses full of young human
73,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","nature,--love, naughtiness, grace, caprice, mischievous tricks, frolic,"
74,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","and all that.  Should you even take a trip to China,--the country"
75,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","that's right under us, you know,--you would get acquainted with the"
76,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Chinese young folks somehow, though you could only converse by signs."
77,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","The boys would look very funny to you, with their yellow tunics, and"
78,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","queer hats, and long ""pigtails,""--and the girls with their hair turned"
79,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","up into a top-knot, their slanting eyes, and their tottering walk,--for"
80,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",the rich young ladies there have no feet to speak of.  They compress
81,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","their _feet_ instead of their _waists_, because, you see, they are not"
82,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Christians.  So you could n't dance, jump the rope, play _croquet_, or"
83,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",take a run on the great Chinese wall with them; but you could play with
84,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","puzzles, have tea-parties, and pick the tea-leaves right from the"
85,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",bushes.
86,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",
87,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Children all the world over laugh and weep, quarrel and make up, play"

89,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","little brothers and sisters,--are a sweet care and a dear perplexity,"
90,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","and are God's little folk, all of them.  I think they have the best"
91,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","share of His love and of this life's happiness wherever they are.  But,"
92,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","darlings, I want you to feel that you need not envy any children on"
93,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","earth,--not the richest and proudest, not the daughters of a German"
94,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Grand Duke, with a kingdom so large that you could scarcely walk across"
95,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","it in a long summer day, nor any East-Indian Princesses, twinkling with"
96,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","diamonds, and rattling with pearls, and riding on elephants, nor"
97,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","Turkish Princesses wearing baggy satin trousers and velvet jackets, and"
98,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","walking on costly carpets, nor Chinese Princesses that don't walk at"
99,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","all, nor Spanish Princesses who go to bull-fights in splendid"
100,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","state-coaches, and wear long trains, and are every now and then"
101,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","presented to the Queen, their mother, and allowed to kiss her hand, nor"
102,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",even English Princesses who live in castles and palaces and see the
103,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA",Queen every day.  I really want you to feel that yours is a proud and
104,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","happy lot, in being true-born American girls, in having honest and"
105,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","loyal parents, in having lived during our grand sad war for Union, in"
106,"TO THE LITTLE COUSINS ANNIE, KITTY, AND CORDELIA","having heard the ringing of the bells of peace, in having loved and"

195,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""O Tommy, what a funny little woman! come and see!"" cried Harry Wilde,"
196,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"as he stood at the window of his father's house, in a pleasant English"
197,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"town.  Tommy ran to the window and looked out, and laughed louder than"
198,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,his brother.  It was indeed a funny sight to see.  In the midst of a
199,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"pelting rain, through mud and running water, there waddled along the"
200,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"queerest, quaintest little roly-poly figure you can imagine.  It was a"
201,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"dwarf woman, who, though no taller than a child of seven or eight"
202,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"years, wore an enormous bonnet, and carried an overgrown umbrella.  Her"
203,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"clothes were tucked up about her in a queer way, and altogether she was"
204,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"a very laugh-at-able little creature.  As she passed, she looked up,"
205,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"and such an odd face as she had!  The nose was large and long, as"
206,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,though it had kept on growing after the other features gave out.
207,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"Indeed, it was so big that the eyes had got into a way of looking at it"
208,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"constantly, which did not improve their beauty.  The hair was bushy,"
209,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"and of a lively red, but the mouth was quite sweet and good-humored,"
210,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"and the little crossed eyes had a merry, kindly twinkle in them."
211,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
212,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""Well,"" said Harry, ""if I were such an absurd looking body as that, I"
213,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"wouldn't show myself.  I 'd hide by day, and only come out by night,"
214,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"like an owl, would n't you, Tommy?"""
215,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
216,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""Yes,"" said the little boy, and then asked, ""Did God make her, Harry?"""
217,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
218,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""Why yes, He made what there is of her, and then I suppose He concluded"
219,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"it wasn't worth while to go on with her!"""
220,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
221,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""Harry!  Harry!"" cried the mother of the little boys, ""you must not"
222,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,talk so; it is wicked.  That poor little dwarf may be of much use in
223,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"the world, and do a great deal of good, if she has a kind heart; and"
224,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"she looks as though she had."""
225,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
226,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""I should like to know of what use such a poor wee thing can be,"" said"
227,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"Harry, shrugging his shoulders."
228,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
229,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""God knows,"" said Mrs. Wilde, ""and He did not make her in vain."""
230,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
231,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"The next day was Christmas.  The rain was over, and it was clear and"
232,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,cold.
233,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
234,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"""Hurrah!"" cried Harry from the window, ""here's our wee bit woman again."
235,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,Her hair is as fiery as ever.  I wonder the rain didn't put it out.
236,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"She might warm her hands in it, if it weren't for carrying that big"
237,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"basket."""
238,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,
239,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"Mrs. Wilde looked out.  The dwarf was trudging slowly along, bearing a"
240,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,heavy basket.  The good lady was seized with a strong desire to know
241,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"more about the strange little creature; so she hurried to her room, put"
242,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"on a bonnet and cloak, went out and followed after her, quietly.  She"
243,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,had to go a long way before her curiosity was satisfied; but at last
244,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"she saw the dwarf enter a miserable house, in the suburbs of the town."
245,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"Mrs. Wilde stole up to a window, and ventured to look in.  She saw the"
246,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"dwarf surrounded by a crowd of shouting children, to whom she was"
247,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"giving Christmas-cake, toys, and clothes from her basket.  She saw her"
248,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"give food and medicine to a poor woman, who lay on a bed in a corner."
249,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"She heard her say, ""Have the coals come?"" and the woman answer, ""Yes,"
250,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"and the blankets; God bless you!""  She saw her take up the baby, feed"
251,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"it, and play with it,--so big a baby, that Mrs. Wilde thought it ought"
252,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"to take turns in tending, with the good little dwarf.  Then the lady"
253,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"turned away in tears, and went home.  When she had told Harry what she"
254,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"had seen, he blushed deeply, and Tommy said: ""God knew better than"
255,HOW WE ACT; NOT HOW WE LOOK.,"brother what the funny little woman was good for, did n't He?"""

285,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.
286,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
287,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"It was at a rectory, in the South of England, that two young children,"
288,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"a boy and a girl, were looking out of a nursery window, on Christmas"
289,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"morning,--the morning of the first snow.  The girl, who was about seven"
290,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"years old, was a beautiful, simple-hearted, amiable child, the daughter"
291,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"of English parents, residing in India.  Some months previous to this"
292,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"winter morning she had been sent to England, on account of her delicate"
293,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"health, and confided to the care of her mother's sister, Mrs. Graham,"
294,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,the Rector's wife.  Her name was Margaret Pelham; but she was called
295,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Meggie and Meg, Peggy and Peg, and various other odd nicknames by her"
296,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,English cousins.
297,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
298,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Little Margaret's chief playmate at the Rectory was her cousin Archie,"
299,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"a boy only two years older than herself, but feeling ever so much"
300,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"bigger and wiser; for he was an only son, a clever and rather conceited"
301,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"young gentleman.  He was good-natured, and loved his cousin; but he"
302,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,loved better to tease and hoax her.  Having lived all her little life
303,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"in India, Meggie was exceedingly ignorant of customs and things in her"
304,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"new home, and was continually making laughable mistakes, and asking the"
305,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"most absurd questions.  This ""greenness,"" as he called it, gave Archie"
306,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"immense delight, and he was never tired of mystifying and hoaxing the"
307,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"sweet-tempered little girl, who never resented his quizzings and"
308,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,practical jokes.  Of course it never occurred to the silly boy that he
309,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,was just as ignorant about India as Meggie was about England.
310,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
311,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"This morning, the children being left for a time alone in the nursery,"
312,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,he was having a rare time at his favorite amusement.  Meggie had never
313,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"before seen snow, and was full of innocent wonder and admiration.  ""O"
314,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Cousin Archie!"" she said, ""the pretty white clouds we saw yesterday all"
315,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"fell down in the night!  Did you hear the noise?"""
316,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
317,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""Clouds!"" cried Archie, with a snort of contemptuous laughter; ""why,"
318,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"you poor little Hindoo, that's _snow_, and it came down so slow and"
319,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"soft that nobody heard it."""
320,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
321,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""O, is that snow?"" said Meggie, laughing good-humoredly at her own"
322,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"ignorance.  ""How beautiful it is! so soft and white.  It looks just"
323,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"like my little dovey's feathers.  I think, Archie, the angels' beds"
324,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"must be made out of snow, aren't they?"""
325,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
326,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""O yes, of course, it would be so warm and comfortable, you know."""
327,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
328,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""Yes, it looks nice and warm.  I think God must send it down to keep"
329,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"things from dying of cold.  He puts the grass and flowers to bed so,"
330,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"don't He?"" said simple and wise little Meggie."
331,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
332,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Archie could not stand this.  He shouted and clapped his hands, and"
333,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"even rolled on the carpet in an ecstasy of boyish fun, crying out, ""O,"
334,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"how jolly green! how jolly green!"""
335,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
336,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""What?"" said Meggie, ""_I_ don't see anything green.  All is white, as"
337,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,far as I can see.  The trees and bushes look as though they had
338,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"night-gowns and night-caps on.  How pretty the snow is, how clean and"
339,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"soft!  I should like to run about in it, wouldn't you, Archie?"""
340,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
341,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""O yes, it's prime fun,"" replied the mischievous boy, ""but it's no"
342,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"rarity to me.  I 'm used to it, you know.  But _you_ would delight in"
343,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"it, especially with bare feet.  That way it is jolly, better than"
344,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"wading in a brook.  Suppose you try it, Peg?"""
345,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
346,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,It required little urging to persuade the simple child to take off her
347,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,shoes and stockings and run down with her cousin to the great hall
348,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"door.  She threw on her little cloak, for she said to herself, ""The"

351,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"The children met no one on their way.  Archie, with some difficulty,"
352,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"opened the door, then said, ""Now, Peg, run quick, away out into the"
353,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"pretty snow, and see how nice it feels, just like down."""
354,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
355,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Meggie did as she was bid, and Archie slammed the door after her, and"
356,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"bolted it, laughing uproariously.  You may be sure the poor little girl"
357,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"soon found how cruelly she had been hoaxed, and ran back again.  She"
358,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"knocked at the door, crying, ""O Cousin Archie, do let me in!  The snow"
359,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"isn't nice at all; it's so cold it freezes my feet.  Do, do let me in."""
360,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
361,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,But Archie only laughed and danced like a young savage for a minute
362,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"longer, then seemed to be trying to open the door, and called out in"
363,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,some trouble that he could not move the bolt.  Little Meggie sat down
364,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,on the door-step and waited patiently till she was almost frozen.  At
365,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"last, after getting nearly exhausted in tugging at the heavy bolt,"
366,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,Archie succeeded in shoving it back.  He found his little cousin so
367,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,benumbed that he was obliged to carry her in his arms all the way to
368,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"the nursery.  Then he sat her down by the fire, chafed her hands and"
369,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"feet, and put on her stockings and shoes, saying many times, ""I am"
370,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"sorry, Meggie, dear; I am so sorry!"""
371,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
372,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""O, never mind, it was only a joke,"" said Meggie, and tried to smile,"
373,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,though she suffered a great deal more than Archie knew of.
374,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
375,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,But Meggie's troubles were only begun.  When they went down to
376,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"breakfast, Mrs. Graham, who had seen from the parlor window the tracks"
377,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"of little bare feet in the snow, questioned the children about them."
378,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Meggie owned up at once that she had run out barefoot in the snow,"
379,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"because it looked so soft and nice, but said not a word about Archie's"
380,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,having prompted her to the foolish act; and I really blush to say that
381,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,Archie himself was not frank and brave enough to acknowledge his fault.
382,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"The fact is, he was afraid of his father, who was a stern and godly"
383,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"man, and had small mercy for the sins of little folks.  Both the Rector"
384,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"and his wife reproved Meggie for her thoughtlessness, and the gentle"
385,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"little girl shed some silent tears; but, after all, I think Archie, who"
386,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"sat trying to gulp down his breakfast with a bold face, suffered the"
387,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"most.  All day long he was unusually kind to his cousin, and she soon"
388,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"got over her sadness, and was as merry and loving as ever."
389,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
390,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"The next morning, when the nursery-maid came to awake Archie, she told"
391,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"him that his cousin had been taken very ill in the night,--so ill that"
392,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"they had had to send for the doctor, who feared that she might never"
393,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"get well.  She had taken a violent cold, some way, he said."
394,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
395,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Archie hurried on his clothes, and ran down to the nursery.  He found"
396,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"his mother sitting by Meggie's little bed, looking very sad and"
397,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"anxious.  He stole up to his cousin, and taking her little hand, hot"
398,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"with fever, bent down and kissed it, with a burst of bitter tears,"
399,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"sobbing out, ""O Meggie, forgive me, do, do forgive me!"""
400,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
401,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""Forgive you for what, Archie?"" asked Mrs. Graham."
402,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
403,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""For being cruel and cowardly, mamma.  It was I who sent Meggie out"
404,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"into the snow, bare-foot, and then was afraid to take my share of the"
405,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,blame.  I was so miserable all day.  I came near owning it when you
406,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"kissed me good night, but papa looked so solemn, I _could n't_.  I did"
407,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"n't say my prayers; I felt too _mean_ to pray."""
408,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
409,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"""God forgive you, my son!"" said Mrs. Graham, somewhat sternly; but"
410,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"little Meggie murmured, in a sweet, faint voice, ""O Cousin Archie, why"
411,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"did you tell?  Maybe I would have died, and nobody but us would ever"
412,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"have known anything about it."""
413,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,
414,LITTLE FOOTMARKS IN THE SNOW.,"Meggie did not die, however.  She got well after a long illness,--quite"

479,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,The Reverend Charles Rivers was the Rector of a small country parish in
480,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"the North of England.  He was a good man, a true minister of Christ to"
481,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"his people.  He had a lovely wife, and four beautiful children, and"
482,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,there was no happier or sweeter home in all the country round than the
483,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"modest little Rectory, embowered in ivy and climbing roses."
484,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
485,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"Four or five miles from the parish church, on a noble eminence, rise"
486,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"the lofty towers of Glenmore Castle, which for centuries has been the"
487,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,great family seat of the Lords of Glenmore.  It is surrounded by
488,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"beautiful gardens, laid out in the French style, with hedges of box,"
489,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,full ten feet high.  Beyond these a noble wooded park stretches away on
490,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"all sides, for miles, taking in hill and valley, and a fairy little"
491,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"lake.  To the southward it is crossed by a lazy, loitering stream,"
492,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"shadowed by willows, fringed with flags, and in the early summer"
493,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,flecked by snowy water-lilies.
494,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
495,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,The Lord Glenmore of the time of my story was a handsome young
496,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"nobleman, married to a pretty London lady, very gay and fond of"
497,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"splendor, but kind-hearted and gentle to every one."
498,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
499,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,Whenever Lord Glenmore came up from London to his northern
500,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"estate,--usually in the shooting season of the early autumn,--the happy"
501,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"event was made known to his tenants and friends, by the running up of a"
502,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,flag on the loftiest turret of the Castle.
503,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
504,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"Mr. Rivers had been his tutor, and his Lordship always hastened to"

507,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"unceremonious way, and frequently inviting the Rector and his wife to"

509,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
510,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"During one of these pleasant dinner-parties, Lord Glenmore, turning to"

513,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,Now Laura and I want a little help.  We have had a rather embarrassing
514,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"arrival at the Castle,--the motherless little son and daughter of my"
515,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"brother, Colonel Montford.  They were sent over from India, at our"
516,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"suggestion, but we hardly know what to do with them.  They are shy and"
517,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"homesick, and thus far have had little to say to any one but their"
518,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"dusky old Ayah, their Indian nurse.  Now, children can get on best with"
519,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"children, and so, my dear madam, I beg that you will lend us"
520,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"yours,--those charming little daughters, staid Margaret and roguish"
521,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"Maud, and that fine lad Robert.  As for wee Master Alfred, my baby"

525,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,

530,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
531,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,Early on a lovely autumn morning the children at the Rectory were made
532,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,ready for the important visit.  As soon as Lord Glenmore's carriage
533,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"appeared in sight, they ran into the nursery, their faces bright with"
534,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"joyous anticipations, to bid their mamma good by.  She was sitting with"
535,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"the baby on her lap, and they all bent down to kiss ""the dear little"

540,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"""I am afraid not quite well,"" Mrs. Rivers replied; ""he seems feverish."

545,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"put yourself on your dignity with young Montford, on account of his"
546,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"shyness.  Remember, almost everything is strange to him here, and he is"
547,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"sad.  I am sure he does not mean to be haughty."""
548,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
549,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"""O yes,"" replied Robert, turning from the canine playfellow he was"
550,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"affectionately patting, ""I mean to treat him just the same as though he"
551,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,were a true-born Briton.  He isn't to blame for being only an
552,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"unfortunate Cawnpore boy, born among heathens and boa-constrictors and"
553,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"Juggernauts, and not knowing how to skate, or make snowballs.  Good by,"
554,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"mamma, don't trouble yourself about me; I 'll carry myself 'this side"

558,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
559,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"Mr. Rivers, after seeing the children off, entered the nursery, to find"

565,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
566,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,But the mother dared not leave the little one till he was asleep.  He
567,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"slept very soundly until noon, and when he awoke it was evident that he"
568,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"was seriously ill.  Mrs. Rivers again took him on her lap, but to her"
569,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"grief perceived that he did not seem to know her.  Soon, his sweet blue"
570,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"eyes were rolled upward, his brow contracted, his lips were set, and"
571,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"his tender limbs grew rigid.  Medical aid was called at once, but the"
572,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"little sufferer passed from one spasm into another, till almost ere"
573,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"physician and parents were aware that he was going, poor little Alfred"

588,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,"the day at the Castle, to remark on any change in him.  They ran into"

593,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,
594,THE DAY AT THE CASTLE.,They displayed before her presents of choice fruit and flowers from

728,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Little Ruth Mason sat one sweet June morning in the church-porch, by"
729,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"the side of her old grandfather, who stood reverently leaning on his"
730,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"staff, with his hat in his hand.  They were both watching from that"
731,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"ivied porch a touching and impressive scene,--the burial service in the"
732,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,old churchyard.
733,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
734,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Mr. Mason had been for many years the sexton of the parish, and though"
735,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"now too old to discharge the duties of the office, he felt such a"
736,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"loving interest in the parish church, one of the finest in England,"
737,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,that he could not keep away from it.  Every day he visited the scene of
738,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"his old labors, and kindly gave the new sexton the benefit of his long"
739,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,experience.  Sometimes he might be seen kneeling in silent prayer in
740,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"the noble chancel, the sunlight that streamed through the stained"
741,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,windows falling in tender glory on his venerable head.  Sometimes he
742,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"would linger by the hour in the beautiful churchyard, beside the graves"
743,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"of his wife, his son, and his son's wife, all the dear ones God had"
744,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"given him, except one little granddaughter.  This last remaining object"
745,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"of his affection and care was a lovely and loving child, of a"
746,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"peculiarly thoughtful mind, and of a sweet, constant, religious nature."
747,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"She had been carefully trained by a good grandmother, and was prudent"
748,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,and industrious beyond her years.  When not in the little village
749,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"school, she was almost always with her grandfather, his little"
750,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"companion, pupil, and house-keeper."
751,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
752,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,This interesting orphan child was most kindly regarded by many of the
753,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,good village people.  She seemed so lonely and helpless in the old
754,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"sexton's desolate cottage,--but a poor place at best.  Yet she was"
755,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,hardly an object of pity.  Her father and mother had died in her
756,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"infancy, and after her first childish grieving for her grandmother was"
757,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"past, she seemed quite happy and content with the care and"
758,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,companionship of her grandfather.  It was with difficulty that she had
759,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,been persuaded now and then to leave him to spend an afternoon at the
760,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"pleasant Rectory, when the Rector's kind wife sent for her, to amuse a"
761,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"sickly little daughter, who was very fond of her, and in whom Ruth's"
762,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"health, strength, and cheery spirit excited a pathetic wonder and"
763,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,delight.
764,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
765,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"It was the burial of this child, poor little Lilly Kingsley, which Ruth"
766,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,and her grandfather were beholding from the shadowy church-porch on
767,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"that lovely June morning.  Mr. Mason stood with his head bowed,"
768,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"intently listening to the solemn burial service, and reverently"
769,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"wondering at the providence of God, which had passed by him, so old,"
770,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"feeble, and almost useless, and taken from the good Rector and his wife"
771,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,their one only darling.
772,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
773,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth had wept bitterly over the body of her little friend, as she had"
774,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"seen it that morning, in the coffin, almost covered with white flowers,"
775,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,and nearly as white as they; but now she watched the mournful
776,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"ceremonies with a rapt and eager interest, too profound for tears.  Her"
777,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"young spirit was struggling with the mystery of death, and thoughts of"
778,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,immortality.  She knew that the wasted little body let down into the
779,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"dark grave was not all of her poor playmate, and she strove to picture"
780,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"a little angel like Lilly, only blooming, and happy, and free from"
781,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"pain, borne upwards through the still summer night, by tender angels,"
782,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"who looked back very pityingly on the grieving parents, bending over"
783,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,the death-bed of their risen darling.
784,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
785,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"So lost was the child in these thoughts, that she did not speak nor"
786,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"move till the service was over, and the weeping group that had stood by"
787,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,the grave had passed out of the churchyard.
788,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
789,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"A few days after this funeral, little Ruth coming home from school,"
790,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,found the Rector in earnest conversation with her grandfather.  She
791,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"courtesied timidly to the clergyman, but he drew her to his knee,"
792,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"looked kindly into her beautiful dark eyes, and said, ""How would Ruth"
793,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"like to live always at the Rectory, and fill the place of our little"
794,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"lost daughter?"""
795,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
796,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth's sweet face flushed with delight, and she answered, ""O, sir, I"
797,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"should dearly love such a beautiful home, and _you_ would too, would"
798,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"n't you, grandpapa?"""
799,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
800,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"The Rector looked at Mr. Mason, and the old man, drawing the child to"
801,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"him, said tenderly, ""My dear little girl, your old grandfather cannot"
802,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"leave this cottage, in which he was born, and in which he has always"
803,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"lived, until he goes to his long home."""
804,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
805,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Then _I'll_ not go,"" cried Ruth, impulsively flinging her arms about"
806,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"his neck.  ""I 'll never, never leave you.  Who would take care of you"
807,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"if I were gone?"""
808,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
809,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"The Rector smiled; but the old man answered gravely, ""I know I shall"
810,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"miss you, dear, very much; but the Lord will care for me, and He it is"
811,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,who has provided this home for my darling.  I bless His name for His
812,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"loving-kindness.  You have always been a good, obedient child to me,"
813,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and I know you will obey me, even when I send you away from me,--for"
814,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"your best good, mind, my darling."""
815,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
816,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth still wept, and begged to be allowed to stay with him; but her"
817,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"grandfather was firm, and she yielded at last.  He led her to the"
818,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Rectory, kissed and blessed her, and placed her in the arms of Mrs."
819,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Kingsley, then hobbled out of the gate, and back to his desolate"
820,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"cottage, as fast as his poor old limbs could carry him."
821,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
822,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth was very sad all the afternoon, though everybody was kind to her,"
823,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and her new mother strove tenderly to comfort her.  As evening came on,"
824,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"her heart would go back to the humble old home, and the white-haired,"
825,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"feeble old man, who she knew must be thinking of her, and missing her"
826,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"so sadly.  At length, Mrs. Kingsley conducted her to a pleasant little"
827,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"chamber, which was henceforth to be her own.  The good lady helped her"
828,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"to undress, put on her a dainty little ruffled nightgown, and knelt"
829,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,with her by her bedside while she said her prayers.  After praying in a
830,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"broken voice for her poor old grandpapa in his loneliness, the child"
831,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,remembered to ask God's blessing on her new parents.  After seeing her
832,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"in her snowy little bed, Mrs. Kingsley removed Ruth's clothes to a"
833,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"closet near by, and brought out a complete suit of garments suited to"
834,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"her new condition.  They were very neat and pretty, and Ruth, who loved"
835,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"all beautiful things, smiled on them through her tears, and reaching"
836,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"out her hand, felt of them with simple, childish delight.  Then a"
837,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"strange, thoughtful look passing over her face, she said, ""Mamma!"" Mrs."
838,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,Kingsley started.  It was the first time she had heard that name since
839,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"her Lilly died, though she had asked Ruth to call her by it when she"
840,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"was first brought to the Rectory.  But she answered, with a smile,"
841,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""What, my daughter?"""
842,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
843,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Why, mamma, laying off my faded clothes and putting on those lovely"
844,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"new ones will be like Lilly, leaving the poor, pale body she used to"
845,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"have, for her glorious angel body, won't it?"""
846,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
847,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Yes, darling,"" replied the mother, to whose heart the simple"
848,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"illustration brought a sweet, wonderful realization of the blessed"
849,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"change; and as she stooped and kissed Ruth good night, a tear fell on"
850,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,the little girl's cheek.
851,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
852,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"The adopted child slept tranquilly till nearly morning, when she awoke"
853,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"suddenly, probably from a dream of the home she had left, but thinking"
854,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"that she heard a voice above her, saying solemnly, ""Ruth, little Ruth,"
855,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"why hast thou forsaken My servant, thy grandfather?"""
856,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
857,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"She was not frightened, yet she could not sleep again, but sat up in"
858,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"her little bed, impatiently waiting for the day.  In the first gray"
859,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"light of dawn she rose, went to the closet, took out her old clothes,"
860,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and dressed herself in them, and casting scarcely a look on the new"
861,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"clothes or round the sweet little chamber, she stole softly down"
862,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"stairs.  She found a housemaid in the hall, who, not knowing the plans"
863,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"of her master and mistress in regard to the little girl, let her out,"
864,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and she ran swiftly home.  She found the cottage door unfastened, for"
865,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"the poor have little fear of burglars.  Entering quietly, and finding"
866,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"her grandpapa still asleep, she lay down by his side, and when he"
867,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"awoke, her dear arms were about his neck, and her loving eyes smiling"
868,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"into his.  At first, he forgot she had been away; but after a moment,"
869,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"he remembered, and exclaimed, ""You here, little Ruth?  Why did you come"
870,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"back, against my wish?"""
871,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
872,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Because the Lord sent me back,"" she answered, gravely."
873,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
874,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Why, child, what do you mean?"" he asked."
875,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
876,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"""Grandpapa, dear, this is how it was: There was a voice, such a sweet"
877,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and solemn voice, that came and sounded right by me, in the darkness,"
878,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"and it said, 'Ruth, little Ruth, why forsakest thou My servant, thy"
879,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"grandfather?' and I was sure it was the Lord's voice, the very same"
880,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"that spoke to little Samuel, and I could not stay after I heard it.  I"
881,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"will never leave you to live and die alone, even if the queen wants to"
882,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"adopt me.  Why, grandpapa, if God had meant you to be without me, He"
883,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"would have taken me, instead of little Lilly Kingsley.  So don't send"
884,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"me away from you, dear grandpapa; it would be wicked."""
885,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
886,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"The good old man, with tears in his dim eyes, replied, ""No, my darling"
887,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,little girl shall not be sent away again; it does seem to be the Lord's
888,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"will that you should stay with me as long as I stay."""
889,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
890,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"And so she stayed,--the faithful little Ruth.  Her good friends at the"
891,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Rectory were sorry to lose her, but not displeased with her, and were"
892,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"more kind than ever to her and her grandfather.  The next Sunday, as"
893,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"she knelt with him among the poor, she was glad in her heart that she"
894,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,was not shut away from him in the Rector's crimson-cushioned pew.
895,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
896,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"It was on a Sunday a few weeks later, that her grandfather, after their"
897,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"frugal dinner, called her to go with him to the churchyard, saying, ""A"
898,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"year ago to-day, Ruth, your dear grandmother died; let us go and spend"
899,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"an hour or two by her grave."""
900,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
901,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"They took the family Bible, and read and talked a long time, sitting on"
902,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"the daisied grass, under the pleasant shade of a willow.  At last, the"
903,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"good old man seemed to grow weary, and bowing his white head on the"
904,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"grave, with one arm flung over it, he fell asleep while Ruth was"
905,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,singing a hymn which her grandmother had taught her.  Then Ruth stole
906,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"away, and wandered about the churchyard, reading the inscriptions on"
907,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"the tombstones, till the people began to enter the church for evening"
908,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"service.  Then she returned to her grandfather, and touched him on the"
909,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"shoulder, to wake him.  But he did not move.  She called his name, but"
910,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"he did not seem to hear her.  Just then the Rector came up, and seeing"
911,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth's trouble, bent down to look into the face of the old man.  He"
912,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"raised the withered hand that lay on the mound, and held it a moment,"
913,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"looking anxious and sad.  When he laid it down, he put his arms about"
914,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"Ruth, and said, tenderly, ""My dear child, your grandfather is"
915,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,awake--_in Heaven_.  He will never wake on earth.  The Lord has taken
916,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"him."""
917,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
918,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,With a piteous cry Ruth flung herself by the side of her dead
919,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"grandfather, and called him by many fond names, weeping bitterly; and"
920,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"strong men wept in pity for her bereavement, and stood with uncovered"
921,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,heads as her grandfather was lifted and borne to his old home.
922,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
923,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,[Illustration: Ruth]
924,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,
925,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,From that old home he was carried forth to be laid by the side of his

927,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,"weeping, yet grateful, to her new home by the Rector and his wife,"
928,FAITHFUL LITTLE RUTH.,henceforth to be to them a dear and cherished child.  Few were the

1000,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"discontented, believing that other children were far happier than she."
1001,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"All such little girls as had brothers and sisters to play with them,"
1002,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"and run about with them in the woods and over the moors, she envied"
1003,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"bitterly, even though they were the children of poor peasants,--never"
1004,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,thinking it possible that they might be envying her at the same time.
1005,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1006,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Lord Blantyre resided principally at Blantyre Castle, on a noble"
1007,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"estate, among the heathery hills of Scotland.  The Castle was very"
1008,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"ancient, with towers, and turrets, and a massive gateway, but it had"
1009,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"many modern additions which beautified it, and gave it a cheerful,"
1010,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"almost home-like look.  Through the old moat there slowly ran a bright,"
1011,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"clear stream, in which grew hosts of water-lilies, and other aquatic"
1012,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"plants.  Beyond this were soft, green, close-shaven lawns and"
1013,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"shrubberies, and gardens full of fountains and statues and fairy-like"
1014,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"bowers; the stables, full of beautiful horses and ponies; the kennels,"
1015,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"where a pack of noble stag-hounds was kept; the dairy, the"
1016,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"poultry-yard, and the pretty little houses of the gold and silver"
1017,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"pheasants.  Around all was a great wooded park, filled with fleet"
1018,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,spotted deer.
1019,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1020,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"In this park Bertha often walked with her mother, or was whirled along"
1021,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"in a small open phaeton, drawn by two lovely white ponies, which Lady"
1022,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,Blantyre herself drove.
1023,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1024,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"In the wildest and most remote part of the park lived the gamekeeper,"
1025,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"who, with his wife, had been born and bred on the estate, and from"
1026,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,childhood had been in the service of the noble family.  Lady Blantyre
1027,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,never passed the cottage of Robert MacWillie in her drives without
1028,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"stopping to inquire after the health of his wife, who had once been her"
1029,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"maid, and of their fine brood of little ones.  During these visits"
1030,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Bertha became acquainted with the young foresters, and as she was of a"
1031,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"simple and amiable disposition, and not a bit haughty or conceited, she"
1032,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,liked them all heartily.  But she especially took to a little girl
1033,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"about her own age, named Lilly, and a boy a year or two older, called"
1034,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,Hughie.
1035,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1036,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,One day as Lady Blantyre and Bertha were driving along the shore of a
1037,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"miniature loch or pond, near Robert MacWillie's cottage, they saw"
1038,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Hughie and Lilly playing in a burn, or brook, which emptied into the"
1039,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"little loch.  Hughie was constructing a dam, with stones and turf and"
1040,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"heather-branches cemented with clay, and Lilly was sailing a tiny boat,"
1041,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"loaded with pebbles and flowers.  Both were barefoot, and plashing"
1042,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"fearlessly in the burn.  Lady Blantyre checked her ponies, and after"
1043,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"watching the children awhile, called them to the side of her phaeton."
1044,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Hughie took off his Glengary cap, and held it in his hand, and Lilly"
1045,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,was about to pull from her head a wild-looking wreath of daisies and
1046,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"purple heather-blooms, when Bertha exclaimed, ""Don't take it off! it is"
1047,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"so pretty; who made it?"""
1048,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1049,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Brother Hughie,"" answered Lilly, blushing."
1050,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1051,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""How good he must be!  Do you like playing and wading in the water and"
1052,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"picking wild-flowers?"""
1053,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1054,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Yes,"" said Lilly, looking down, and drawing figures in the sand with"
1055,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"her rosy little toes.  ""Hughie is gude.  I like playing wi' the burn,"
1056,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"and flowers are bonny wee things""; then, looking up timidly, she"
1057,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"offered to her friend a bunch of water-lilies, which Hughie had waded"
1058,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,far out into the pond up to his short kilt to obtain.
1059,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1060,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Thank you,"" said Bertha.  ""O how sweet they are, a thousand times"
1061,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"sweeter than those that grow in the moat, are n't they, mamma?"""
1062,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1063,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Lady Blantyre smiled, for there was really no difference, the lilies at"
1064,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,the Castle having been brought from this very pond.
1065,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1066,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""How long have you been at your great work there?"" she asked of Hughie."
1067,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1068,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""For maist a week, my Lady; but for the last twa days Domine MacGregor"
1069,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"has been down wi' an ill turn, and I hae (have) lost na time at schule"
1070,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"(school), so I hae got on weel wi' it.  It will soon be done noo."""
1071,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1072,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""And what do you intend to do with it when it is finished?"" asked the"
1073,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,lady.
1074,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1075,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""I canna say, but I think we 'll play flood-time wi' it."""
1076,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1077,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""What is that?"""
1078,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1079,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Your ladyship sees that wee-bit island; weel, we'll put on it some"
1080,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"doggies and a cat."""
1081,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1082,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Not my wee puss, Winkie?"" cried Lilly in alarm."
1083,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1084,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""No, auld black Tammy will do, and a chicken or twa, and we 'll watch"
1085,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"the water rise and rise, till the puir creatures huddle togither and"
1086,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"greet and cackle and howl, then I 'll loup (leap) intil the burn, and"
1087,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"one after anither rescue them a'."""
1088,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1089,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O, how grand that would be!"" exclaimed little Bertha, her eyes"
1090,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,flashing with excitement.
1091,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1092,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Rather cruel sport,"" said Lady Blantyre, shaking her head, yet smiling"
1093,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,in spite of herself.
1094,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1095,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Is it?"" said Hughie, his countenance falling, ""then I 'll no do it.  I"
1096,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"'ll but drive a' the duckies and fulish geese down here, and see them"
1097,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,gae quacking and skirling over the dam.  I hope _they'll_ no object to
1098,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"the sport."""
1099,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1100,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Probably not,"" said her ladyship, pleasantly."
1101,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1102,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O mamma,"" said Bertha, looking up wistfully into her face, ""how I"
1103,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"should love to play so with water and pebbles, and little boats, and"
1104,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"ducks and geese, and dams, all day long!  How happy they must be!"""
1105,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1106,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Perhaps little Lilly thinks it would be a very happy thing to be in"
1107,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"your place, my daughter,"" said Lady Blantyre."
1108,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1109,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""_Do_ you think so?"" asked Bertha, wonderingly."
1110,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1111,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Ay,"" answered Lilly, in a low, almost awestruck tone, ""I think that to"
1112,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"be Miss Bertha, and bide in a braw (fine) Castle, wad be next to being"
1113,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"an angel, or a bonnie fairy princess."""
1114,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1115,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"All laughed at this, but on the way home Bertha was very thoughtful and"
1116,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"sad.  Every time she spoke, it was to bewail her hard lot in being"
1117,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"allowed to take the air only in walks with her governess, or drives"
1118,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"with her mamma, in being obliged to wear fine clothes, to learn music"
1119,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"and dancing, ""and other tiresome things,"" and never being free to run"
1120,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"wild on the hills and heaths, wade in the ponds, and plash in the"
1121,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"burns, like the little MacWillies."
1122,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1123,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Her mother tried to show her that, as her station was different from"
1124,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"theirs, her education and habits should be different, and that she had"
1125,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"a great deal to be thankful for, and might be very happy, if she would."
1126,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1127,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Well, I think I ought at least to have a little brother to play with"
1128,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"me.  I think God might have given me _that_, and kept back some of the"
1129,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"other things."""
1130,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1131,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"At this little burst of petulance, Lady Blantyre sighed and was silent"
1132,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"for some moments.  Then she said: ""Would my little daughter like to try"
1133,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"living at the cottage of the MacWillies for a day or two, just like one"
1134,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"of their own?"""
1135,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1136,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O yes, mamma, and play with Lilly and Hughie?"""
1137,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1138,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""With Hughie and the other children.  I must have Lilly with me at the"
1139,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Castle, to make up for the loss of my little Bertha."""
1140,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1141,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O!"" said Bertha, looking a little disappointed; then she added,"
1142,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"eagerly, ""But, mamma, may I indeed do just like them?--go without a"
1143,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"bonnet, take off my shoes and stockings, and wade in the burn, and"
1144,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"patter in the nice soft clay?"""
1145,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1146,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Yes, if Lilly will consent to take your place, and play the little"
1147,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"lady at the Castle."""
1148,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1149,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"In the afternoon Lady Blantyre sent for Mrs. MacWillie, and between"
1150,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,them they arranged that their little daughters should change places on
1151,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,the morrow; and that night both Bertha and Lilly went to bed with their
1152,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"hearts full of happy anticipations, and each pitying the other."
1153,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1154,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Early in the morning, Lilly was brought to the Castle, and Bertha"
1155,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"conveyed to the cottage.  Lilly wanted to take with her her pet kitten,"
1156,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,but was told that poor little Winkle would be rather too vulgar a
1157,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,visitor for Lady Blantyre's drawing-room.  Bertha proposed to take her
1158,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"pretty King Charles spaniel, but was told that the gamekeeper's rough"
1159,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,mastiffs and terriers would make nothing of taking him by the neck and
1160,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,shaking the life out of him.  So she concluded to leave Frivole behind.
1161,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1162,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"When she reached the cottage, the little MacWillies came around her,"
1163,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"full of wonder and shy admiration.  They said nothing to her, but they"
1164,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"whispered among themselves, and their eyes looked very big and watched"
1165,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,her constantly.
1166,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1167,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Come here, Sandy and Effie!"" she said to a little boy and girl, who"
1168,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"stood with their hands behind them, gazing at her as if she really had"
1169,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"been a fairy princess.  ""Do come to me; I am your sister now, don't you"
1170,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"know?"""
1171,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1172,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"But they only drew back, and as she started toward them, scampered away"
1173,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,and hid behind their mother.
1174,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1175,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Come, Hughie,"" said the little lady, ""let us go down to the burn.  You"
1176,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"must make me a wreath like Lilly's, and play with me just as you do"
1177,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"with her, won't you?"""
1178,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1179,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Hughie gladly promised, and away they went hand in hand.  But the lad"
1180,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,could not quite forget that his playmate was the Honorable Miss Bertha
1181,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Blantyre, so he took the choicest roses from his mother's garden to"
1182,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"make a wreath for her, and for the life of him he could not be as free"
1183,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"and merry with her as with his sister.  However, he was very kind and"
1184,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"amusing, and Bertha was in high glee.  The first thing she did when"
1185,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"they reached the burnside, was to sit down and pull off her shoes and"
1186,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"stockings, then she ran up and down the sandy shore of the loch,"
1187,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"throwing pebbles and daisies into the water, sailing Lilly's little"
1188,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"boat, and laughing and singing like some wild creature.  Then she"
1189,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"helped Hughie at his dam awhile, patting the soft clay with her dainty"
1190,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,little hands.
1191,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1192,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O dear!"" she exclaimed at last."
1193,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1194,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""What's the matter, my bonnie leddie?"" said Hughie, rather"
1195,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,patronizingly.
1196,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1197,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""My feet smart so!  See how big and red they look."""
1198,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1199,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Sae they do.  You hae burned them.  The sun is hot this simmer day,"
1200,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"and the sand as weel, and ye ken (know) ye are no used to gang without"
1201,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"your shoon (shoes); wade a bit, noo, and cool your small saft feet."""
1202,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1203,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Bertha thrust one foot into the water, but drew it out instantly,"
1204,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"exclaiming, ""Ugh, how cold!"""
1205,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1206,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Ay, gin (if) ye only dip the tips o' your toes, like a fearsome cat;"
1207,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"but gin ye rin bravely intil the water, like a spaniel dog, ye'll no"
1208,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"find it cauld,"" said Hughie, taking her hand and leading her in.  But"
1209,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"Bertha still thought it cold; she caught her breath, and shrieked at"
1210,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"every step, frightened not only at the rising water, but at the tiny"
1211,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"fishes within it, and even at the insects skimming along its surface."
1212,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"As Hughie was leading her out, she trod on a stone and cut one of her"
1213,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"delicate feet quite severely.  Then, when she reached the shore, she"
1214,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"found that she could not get on her stockings and shoes, and with her"
1215,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"eyes full of tears she said, ""Ah me! what shall I do?  I can't walk"
1216,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"barefoot among the heather, my feet are so sore already."""
1217,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1218,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,[Illustration: Hughie and Bertha]
1219,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1220,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""O, dinna fash yoursel' (don't trouble yourself) about that, I 'll"
1221,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"carry you in my twa arms,"" said Hughie; and the sturdy little fellow"
1222,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,took her and carried her to the cottage.
1223,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1224,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"After having had her foot bound up, and her face bathed in cream, for"
1225,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"that was also burned, her pretty wreath having proved a very poor"
1226,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"protection from the sun, Bertha was invited to share the midday meal of"
1227,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"the children.  Being very hungry, she gladly sat up to the table and"
1228,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"took her share of milk and oatmeal cakes, or bannocks.  She liked the"
1229,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"milk, but the bannocks scratched her throat and almost brought the"
1230,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,tears to her eyes.  She wondered how the others could eat them so
1231,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,ravenously.
1232,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1233,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"After dinner the children did their best to amuse their visitor, by"
1234,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"playing games, running, leaping, and tumbling about, all very kindly"
1235,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"meant, but rough, noisy, and almost terrifying to Bertha, who was not"
1236,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,sorry when the younger ones ran out of the house to play under the
1237,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"trees.  Hughie sat by her side on the settle, and told her stories,"
1238,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"till she fell asleep.  She was very weary, and slept a long while,"
1239,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"against some cushions which Hughie placed behind her.  When she awoke,"
1240,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"she looked around wonderingly, and, missing the dear faces of her"
1241,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"mother and nurse, burst into tears."
1242,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1243,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""What's the matter wi' my bonnie bairn?"" asked Mrs. MacWillie, tenderly."
1244,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1245,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""I--want--to--go--home!"" sobbed Bertha."
1246,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1247,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""And ye shall gae hame; sae dinna greet (weep), my lammie,"" said the"
1248,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,good woman.
1249,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1250,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"In a very few minutes the gamekeeper, who, by the way, had watched the"
1251,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"children all the morning, from behind some thick bushes by the loch, to"
1252,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"see that no harm befell them, came to the door with the family"
1253,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"carriage,--a two-wheeled vehicle, called a ""dog-cart,"" drawn by a"
1254,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"shaggy old pony.  Bertha was helped into this, and, having taken a kind"
1255,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"but rather hasty leave of her rustic friends, was driven, in a little"
1256,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"lazy, shuffling trot, towards the Castle.  About half-way, who should"
1257,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"they meet but Lady Blantyre, driving Lilly MacWillie home in her"
1258,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"pony-phaeton!  She did not seem to see the dog-cart at all, but dashed"
1259,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,by it at a furious rate.
1260,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1261,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1262,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,Little Lilly had scarcely had a better day than Bertha.  From the first
1263,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"hour of her visit to the Castle she had felt ill at ease, and almost"
1264,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"homesick.  Everything there was so strange and magnificent, that all"
1265,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,the kindness she met with failed to make her feel happy and
1266,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,comfortable.  Lady Blantyre devoted herself to her amusement; she
1267,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"showed her the conservatories and the aviaries, and led her through the"
1268,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,long picture-gallery.  This last was an awful place to Lilly; she was
1269,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"frightened at the array of old-time Blantyres,--fierce soldiers in"
1270,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"armor, grim judges in enormous wigs, and grand ladies in vast hoops and"
1271,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,stupendous head-dresses.
1272,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1273,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"At lunch, Lady Blantyre had her little guest sit beside her, and"
1274,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,pressed her to eat of delicate wild-fowl and luscious fruit.  But Lilly
1275,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"was scared out of the little appetite she had, not by his lordship, who"
1276,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"sat opposite, but by the solemn footman who stood behind her chair."
1277,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"After lunch, Lady Blantyre played and sung for her, and showed her"
1278,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,Bertha's books and toys.
1279,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1280,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"At length she left her alone for a time, while she went to dress.  When"
1281,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,she returned to the drawing-room she could not see the child anywhere;
1282,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"but presently she heard a stifled sob behind the curtain of a window,"
1283,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"looking towards the gamekeeper's cottage.  She went to Lilly, and put"
1284,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"her arms about her, saying, ""What are you grieving about, my dear?"""
1285,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1286,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Let me gae hame!  I maun gae hame!"" (I must go home) said Lilly."
1287,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1288,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""So you shall, darling,"" replied the lady."
1289,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1290,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1291,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"When Lady Blantyre returned from the cottage, she found Bertha in the"
1292,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"nursery, sitting on the lap of her kind nurse Margery."
1293,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,
1294,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"""Well, has my little daughter learned content from this day's"
1295,CASTLE AND COTTAGE.,"experience?"" said the lady, smiling."

1345,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Margaret Grey was a widow, who, with three young children, lived in a"
1346,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"small cottage on the estate of Lord Dundale, in Scotland.  When her"
1347,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"husband died, Margaret had been compelled to give up the land he had"
1348,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"farmed, with the exception of a little garden, and a patch of pasturage"
1349,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"on which she supported a cow and a shaggy Highland pony, called Rab."
1350,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1351,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"This last was a very important member of the family, as without him the"
1352,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"widow could not have conveyed to market the butter and eggs, on the"
1353,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"proceeds of which the frugal little household subsisted.  For his part,"
1354,JAMIE'S FAITH.,Rab seemed fully conscious of his own important and responsible
1355,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"position in the widow's family, gave up all frisking and frolicking"
1356,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"ways, and conducted himself in a staid and sober manner on his way to"
1357,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"and from the market-town, and assumed towards the children in their"
1358,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"little rides a sort of protecting, patronizing, paternal character,"
1359,JAMIE'S FAITH.,which was really edifying to behold.
1360,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1361,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Lord Dundale was a young man, very handsome and stately, but gentle and"
1362,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"gracious, and much beloved by his family and tenants.  The children on"
1363,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"his estate looked up to him with loving reverence, as to a superior"
1364,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"being, from whom nothing but good and happiness were to be expected by"
1365,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the deserving.  For them his youth, beauty, and elegance had especial"
1366,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"poetic charms; their sweet, simple affection, their timid, grateful"
1367,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"devotion, were laid at his feet,--so that when moving among them he"
1368,JAMIE'S FAITH.,trod on unseen flowers.  They loved to hear and to tell of the grand
1369,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"and beautiful things at that fairy palace, the Castle,--a noble old"
1370,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"edifice, with massive towers, a moat, a lofty gateway, and an ancient"
1371,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"drawbridge and portcullis, which stood high in the midst of great"
1372,JAMIE'S FAITH.,forest-trees.
1373,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1374,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Lord Dundale, being in delicate health, was able to spend but a few"
1375,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"months of each year in Scotland, the climate being too severe for him;"
1376,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"but he loved the place of his birth, and was never so happy as when,"
1377,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"like Rob Roy, he could say, ""My foot is on my native heath."""
1378,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1379,JAMIE'S FAITH.,To his tenants his yearly visit to his Scottish estate was always a
1380,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"season of festivity: they hailed the signal of his return, the running"
1381,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"up of a flag on the highest tower of the Castle, with shouts of hearty"
1382,JAMIE'S FAITH.,rejoicing.
1383,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1384,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"The cottage of the Grey was on a shady lane, through which the young"
1385,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"lord often rode in the pleasant autumn mornings or evenings, sometimes"
1386,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"with a gay party of ladies and gentlemen, guests at the Castle,"
1387,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"sometimes, when the hour was early, quite alone, and sometimes with one"
1388,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"beautiful dark-eyed lady, fresh as a rose and proud as a lily, who it"
1389,JAMIE'S FAITH.,was said was one day to be the mistress of Dundale Castle.  The Grey
1390,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"children, little Effie and Jamie, noticed that when the young lord rode"
1391,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"by himself, or with ever so large a party of riders, he never failed to"
1392,JAMIE'S FAITH.,acknowledge their bows and courtesies with a nod and a pleasant word
1393,JAMIE'S FAITH.,and smile; but that when he and the dark-eyed lady together ambled
1394,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"slowly past, he did not seem to see their wistful little faces at all."
1395,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"So, in their secret hearts, they took something very like a spite"
1396,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"against the beautiful Lady Evelyn, and hoped their young lord would"
1397,JAMIE'S FAITH.,change his mind.
1398,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1399,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"One autumn evening, as Margaret Grey rode homeward from the"
1400,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"market-town, she noticed that Rab, the pony, was languid and slow, that"
1401,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"he hung his head dejectedly, and made no effort to browse along the"
1402,JAMIE'S FAITH.,hedge-rows as usual.  She supposed that he was tired with his day's
1403,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"work, but trusted that he would be well in the morning.  Alas! when the"
1404,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"morning came, poor, faithful old Rab was found dead, stretched out"
1405,JAMIE'S FAITH.,stiff and cold in his paddock!
1406,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1407,JAMIE'S FAITH.,Effie and Jamie grieved passionately over their lost friend and
1408,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"playfellow.  They sat down beside him on the grass, and, looking at his"
1409,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"poor, helpless feet, worn in their service, wept bitterly that they"
1410,JAMIE'S FAITH.,would carry them along the lane and up the hillside no more; they
1411,JAMIE'S FAITH.,patted half fearfully the shaggy neck; which would arch to their
1412,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"caresses never again; they drew back with a shudder, after touching the"
1413,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"cold lips which had so often eaten the sweet clover from their hands,"
1414,JAMIE'S FAITH.,and turned with a sense of strange wonder and awfulness from the
1415,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"death-misted eyes, which had always shone upon them with an almost"
1416,JAMIE'S FAITH.,human affection.
1417,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1418,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Margaret Grey wept also,--fewer tears than her children, but sadder."
1419,JAMIE'S FAITH.,She had many sweet and mournful memories connected with poor Rab.  Her
1420,JAMIE'S FAITH.,dear old father gave him to her on her eighteenth birthday.  She
1421,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"remembered many a joyful gallop on his back, through the lanes and over"
1422,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the moors.  She remembered how sometimes she rode him slowly, with his"
1423,JAMIE'S FAITH.,rein on his neck; for young Angus Grey walked by her side and told her
1424,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"pleasant news,--always pleasant and interesting, though always about"
1425,JAMIE'S FAITH.,the same thing.  She remembered how once he checked Rab's rein under
1426,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the shade of a hawthorn-tree, and asked her to be his wife.  She"
1427,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"remembered, too, how Rab had borne her to the Kirk, to be married to"
1428,JAMIE'S FAITH.,Angus Grey; and she thought of three other Sundays when he had carried
1429,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"her and her baby to the christening; and of yet one other time, when he"
1430,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"had drawn slowly away from her door a hearse, whereon lay the beloved"
1431,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"husband and father.  She thought, too, with tender anxiety, that now"
1432,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the last help of the widow, her humble fellow-laborer, was taken from"
1433,JAMIE'S FAITH.,her; and the grim wolf of want and hunger seemed to stand in poor dead
1434,JAMIE'S FAITH.,Rab's place.  Even the baby seemed to feel something of her anxiety and
1435,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"distress, and put up its pretty lip to cry; so to comfort it and to"
1436,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"calm herself by her usual household labor, she returned to the cottage,"
1437,JAMIE'S FAITH.,leaving Effie and Jamie still sitting beside old Rab.  Their grief had
1438,JAMIE'S FAITH.,somewhat moderated; yet they sobbed as they talked of the virtues of
1439,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the deceased, and wondered what life would be without him."
1440,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1441,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"""Ah, Jamie,"" said Effie, ""inna you wish the Lord was here now?  You ken"
1442,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"mither told us how He cured sick folk, and how He once made a mon alive"
1443,JAMIE'S FAITH.,again that had been dead four days.  He could make our Rab alive wi' a
1444,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"touch of His finger, gin (if) He would try, Jamie."""
1445,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1446,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Wee Jamie was a simple-hearted child, scarcely four summers old: his"
1447,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"little brain was easily bewildered.  For him there was but one Lord,"
1448,JAMIE'S FAITH.,the good and generous young nobleman at the Castle.  Of _his_ power and
1449,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"goodness Jamie could believe anything, and though he opened his eyes"
1450,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"wide at his sister's story, his face grew radiant with joy, as just at"
1451,JAMIE'S FAITH.,that moment he caught sight of Lord Dundale trotting slowly down the
1452,JAMIE'S FAITH.,lane on his beautiful thoroughbred bay mare.  In a moment he was over
1453,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"the fence, in the road, in the very path of the rider, crying out in an"
1454,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"agony of entreaty, ""Stop, stop, my lord! our Rab is dead; ye maun"
1455,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"(must) make him alive again!"""
1456,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1457,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Lord Dundale checked his horse, and looked down on his little"
1458,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"petitioner in silent astonishment, while Mrs. Grey ran out of the"
1459,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"cottage, with baby in her arms, and, catching hold of Jamie, strove to"
1460,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"lift him out of the way.  But the little fellow resisted sturdily,"
1461,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"crying still, ""Let him make Rab alive!  He _maun_ make him alive!"""
1462,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1463,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"""But, my little fellow,"" said the Earl, smiling, ""if Rab is really"
1464,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"dead,--and I am very sorry to hear it,--_I_ cannot make him alive: how"
1465,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"could you think of such a thing?"""
1466,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1467,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"But Jamie stood his ground, answering, ""My mither says you once made a"
1468,JAMIE'S FAITH.,big mon alive after he had been dead four days.  Rab is only a sma'
1469,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"pony, and he's been dead but a wee bit while; so it's na a hard job for"
1470,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"you.  Dinna say you will na do it."""
1471,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1472,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"""What _can_ the little lad mean, Mrs. Grey?"" asked Lord Dundale,"
1473,JAMIE'S FAITH.,utterly bewildered.
1474,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1475,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"""I dinna ken (do not know), my lord,"" she replied, ""unless, Heaven save"
1476,JAMIE'S FAITH.,us! he takes you for the Lord of lords.  I didna think the bairn was so
1477,JAMIE'S FAITH.,heathenish and so daft (foolish).  You maun forgie (must forgive) the
1478,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"poor child."""
1479,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1480,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Lord Dundale dismounted, and, taking the little fellow by the hand, by"
1481,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"a few simple questions, soon found that this was indeed Jamie's strange"
1482,JAMIE'S FAITH.,delusion.
1483,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1484,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"""My poor little laddie,"" he said, ""you are wofully mistaken.  I cannot"
1485,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"bring your dear old pony back to life.  You can never play with him, or"
1486,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"feed him, or ride him among the heather or along the burnside again."
1487,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Rab's work is done, and it is time he should rest.  But, Jamie, I can"
1488,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"give you another pony in his place, one that I hope may serve your good"
1489,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"mother as well as Rab, and that you and Effie must love for my sake."
1490,JAMIE'S FAITH.,And now good by.  I hope Jamie will yet know well the Lord most great
1491,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"and good and loving, the only true Lord of life and death."""
1492,JAMIE'S FAITH.,
1493,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"Taking a kindly leave of Mrs. Grey, the young Earl then rode on, but in"
1494,JAMIE'S FAITH.,the course of the day the groom of the Castle galloped down to the
1495,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"widow's cottage, leading the new pony, a handsome, sturdy little"
1496,JAMIE'S FAITH.,"animal, and so gentle and docile that not only Jamie but timid little"

1549,THE TRUE LORD.,
1550,THE TRUE LORD.,"Philip was an only child, fondly beloved by his parents, and, as the"

1571,THE TRUE LORD.,"But Philip, who had always, in spite of his grandeur, felt a little"

1627,THE TRUE LORD.,"of little Arty; and when, after a six months' stay in Ireland, the"
1628,THE TRUE LORD.,"noble family returned to London, little Arthur, really though not"
1629,THE TRUE LORD.,"formally adopted, went with them.  He received his earliest instruction"
1630,THE TRUE LORD.,"with Philip from a kind governess, with the best of care and the most"
1631,THE TRUE LORD.,affectionate counsel.  Lady Ellenwood was very gracious and motherly
1632,THE TRUE LORD.,"towards him, and the Earl always kind; yet he never forgot his humble"
1633,THE TRUE LORD.,"Irish parents, whom he was allowed to visit every year."
1634,THE TRUE LORD.,
1635,THE TRUE LORD.,"Thus years went on, and Arty was regarded as a beloved member of that"
1636,THE TRUE LORD.,"high family,--as the chosen friend, the brother elect, of his young"
1637,THE TRUE LORD.,"master.  They were taught by one tutor, and finally sent to school"
1638,THE TRUE LORD.,"together, always keeping along hand in hand, in the utmost brotherly"
1639,THE TRUE LORD.,"good feeling, with a great, tender love between them,--a love neither"
1640,THE TRUE LORD.,"tainted by haughty condescension on the one side, nor by flattering"
1641,THE TRUE LORD.,subserviency on the other.  It was a beautiful and marvellous affection.
1642,THE TRUE LORD.,
1643,THE TRUE LORD.,"At length the lads were spending their last vacation at home, in the"
1644,THE TRUE LORD.,"old Castle in Wicklow.  They were nearly sixteen, and as fine looking,"
1645,THE TRUE LORD.,"gallant lads as the country could boast.  Such loving, inseparable"
1646,THE TRUE LORD.,"companions were they, that they were playfully named ""David and"
1647,THE TRUE LORD.,"Jonathan."""
1648,THE TRUE LORD.,
1649,THE TRUE LORD.,The pleasure of this visit to the Castle was only marred by the illness
1650,THE TRUE LORD.,"of Mrs. O'Neill, who was thought to be in a decline.  Arthur, though so"
1651,THE TRUE LORD.,"far removed from his simple life by the patronage of the great, had"
1652,THE TRUE LORD.,"always been a good and dutiful son, while Philip had ever evinced a"
1653,THE TRUE LORD.,"remarkable fondness for the warm-hearted foster-mother, whose sad blue"
1654,THE TRUE LORD.,"eyes dwelt on his merry face with a singular expression of yearning,"
1655,THE TRUE LORD.,sorrowful tenderness.
1656,THE TRUE LORD.,
1657,THE TRUE LORD.,"It was the sixteenth birthday of Philip, Lord Alverley, and his happy"
1658,THE TRUE LORD.,"parents gave a ball in honor of the occasion.  All the ""best people"" of"
1659,THE TRUE LORD.,"the country were present, and all was brightness, music, and"
1660,THE TRUE LORD.,"gayety,--joyous hearts keeping time to light, dancing feet.  But, in"
1661,THE TRUE LORD.,"the midst of the festivities, the young lord of the _fête_ and Arthur"
1662,THE TRUE LORD.,"were summoned from the ball-room by Terence O'Neill, the lodge-keeper,"
1663,THE TRUE LORD.,who came to tell them that his poor wife had taken a turn for the
1664,THE TRUE LORD.,"worse, and was sinking rapidly, and that she desired to see her two"
1665,THE TRUE LORD.,dear lads before she should pass away.
1666,THE TRUE LORD.,
1667,THE TRUE LORD.,Without a moment's hesitation the friends set out together for the
1668,THE TRUE LORD.,Lodge.  Terence O'Neill left them there and hastened away to summon the
1669,THE TRUE LORD.,parish priest.  So it happened that the lads found themselves alone by
1670,THE TRUE LORD.,the bedside of Norah O'Neill.  They sank on their knees beside her and
1671,THE TRUE LORD.,"burst into tears.  The dying woman gazed at them with a look of wild,"
1672,THE TRUE LORD.,"passionate love, which seemed struggling with a strange fear, or"
1673,THE TRUE LORD.,remorse.
1674,THE TRUE LORD.,
1675,THE TRUE LORD.,"""O my poor lads!"" she said, ""I have loved ye both, yet ye have both"
1676,THE TRUE LORD.,much to forgive.  When the priest comes I will tell you before him all
1677,THE TRUE LORD.,"my sin,--all the wrong I have done ye both."""
1678,THE TRUE LORD.,
1679,THE TRUE LORD.,"They looked bewildered, but waited silently and patiently for the"
1680,THE TRUE LORD.,"coming of Terence and the priest.  But the anxious minutes went on, and"
1681,THE TRUE LORD.,no one came.  At last Norah half raised herself in bed and hoarsely
1682,THE TRUE LORD.,"whispered, ""He does not come, and I am dying!  I must confess to _you_,"
1683,THE TRUE LORD.,"boys; but if you can't forgive, don't curse your poor broken-hearted"
1684,THE TRUE LORD.,"mother when you know all.  You, Arthur, _are not my son_, though you"
1685,THE TRUE LORD.,"were nursed at my breast, and became like the very pulse of my heart."
1686,THE TRUE LORD.,"_You are the Earl's own son; and you, Philip, are not Lord Alverley;"
1687,THE TRUE LORD.,"you are my first-born, my only son._  I changed you in your cradles."
1688,THE TRUE LORD.,"The Countess was very ill for weeks, the Earl never left her to visit"
1689,THE TRUE LORD.,"her poor, puny baby.  It was sickly; I was sure it would die; I was"
1690,THE TRUE LORD.,tempted to put my own healthier child in its place.  I meant a kindness
1691,THE TRUE LORD.,"to my lord and lady, yet I have never known an hour's peace since that"
1692,THE TRUE LORD.,"day.  Nobody knew my secret, not even my husband, for he was away in"
1693,THE TRUE LORD.,"England, with some harvesters, at the time.  He never suspected.  I"
1694,THE TRUE LORD.,never dared lisp a word of it to the priest.  I shut it all close in my
1695,THE TRUE LORD.,"heart, where it stung like a serpent and ate like a poison.  It is"
1696,THE TRUE LORD.,"killing me.  O my poor, dear, injured lads, can you forgive me before I"
1697,THE TRUE LORD.,"die?"""
1698,THE TRUE LORD.,
1699,THE TRUE LORD.,There was an agony of supplication in the straining eyes and in the
1700,THE TRUE LORD.,broken sob.
1701,THE TRUE LORD.,
1702,THE TRUE LORD.,"Philip spoke first, very tenderly: ""As for myself, mother, I forgive"
1703,THE TRUE LORD.,"you, though you have wronged me by making me a party to a great wrong;"
1704,THE TRUE LORD.,but it was very wicked of you to keep so noble a boy as Arthur so long
1705,THE TRUE LORD.,"out of his rights."""
1706,THE TRUE LORD.,
1707,THE TRUE LORD.,"""O no,"" cried Arthur, ""I have really suffered no wrong.  God so"
1708,THE TRUE LORD.,wonderfully overruled the evil for good.  I have had all the happiness
1709,THE TRUE LORD.,"I could have had as the heir of Ellenwood Castle, and added to it, your"
1710,THE TRUE LORD.,"love, my more than brother.  So, mother dear, I too forgive you, fully"
1711,THE TRUE LORD.,"and freely, and do not despair of God's forgiveness, now that all is"
1712,THE TRUE LORD.,"well between us three."""
1713,THE TRUE LORD.,
1714,THE TRUE LORD.,Norah O'Neill lifted her bowed head and stretched out her arms with a
1715,THE TRUE LORD.,"cry, half joy, half sorrow, then fell back on her pillow.  A mist"
1716,THE TRUE LORD.,"gathered over her eyes, and she spoke no more, but her hands groped"
1717,THE TRUE LORD.,about till they found a hand of each of her boys.  These she raised one
1718,THE TRUE LORD.,"after the other to her lips, and, meekly kissing them, she died."
1719,THE TRUE LORD.,
1720,THE TRUE LORD.,The poor lads had never looked upon death before: they were both
1721,THE TRUE LORD.,"awe-struck, silent, and motionless for a while.  Then Philip bent down"
1722,THE TRUE LORD.,"and closed his mother's eyes, and pressed his lips on her forehead."
1723,THE TRUE LORD.,"But Arthur spoke first.  Laying his hand on Philip's shoulder, he said,"
1724,THE TRUE LORD.,"in a tone of eager imploring, ""Dear brother, we two only know of this"
1725,THE TRUE LORD.,"sad revelation.  Let us bury it in our hearts, and let all be as though"
1726,THE TRUE LORD.,this had never been.  You are far better suited to your present
1727,THE TRUE LORD.,position than I am.  You are one of Nature's noblemen.  It would make
1728,THE TRUE LORD.,"me wretched beyond expression to have to take from you wealth, title,"
1729,THE TRUE LORD.,"parents, everything.  I would rather die.  Let us both keep a life-long"
1730,THE TRUE LORD.,"silence about this sad affair.  I beg, I implore you."""
1731,THE TRUE LORD.,
1732,THE TRUE LORD.,"""O Arthur!"" cried Philip, reproachfully, ""I did not look for this from"
1733,THE TRUE LORD.,"_you_.  Though a peasant born, it seems, I am not base enough to do"
1734,THE TRUE LORD.,anything so dishonorable as that.  You are the last one I would wrong.
1735,THE TRUE LORD.,I will strip myself of everything that belongs to you.  You shall have
1736,THE TRUE LORD.,"your birthright."""
1737,THE TRUE LORD.,
1738,THE TRUE LORD.,"""I will not take it, Philip."""
1739,THE TRUE LORD.,
1740,THE TRUE LORD.,"""You _must_ take it, and you will yet see it is right for you to take"

1742,THE TRUE LORD.,"side of our dead mother.  Ah! here comes O'Neill, _my father_.  We will"
1743,THE TRUE LORD.,"not tell him all now."""
1744,THE TRUE LORD.,
1745,THE TRUE LORD.,"The lodge-keeper, coming too late with the priest, was so absorbed by"
1746,THE TRUE LORD.,"his grief that he noticed nothing unusual in the manner of the lads,"
1747,THE TRUE LORD.,scarcely knew when they took leave of him and returned home.
1748,THE TRUE LORD.,
1749,THE TRUE LORD.,"On the way, Arthur again urged Philip to conceal the strange secret"
1750,THE TRUE LORD.,"just revealed to them.  Philip said no word in reply, but shook his"
1751,THE TRUE LORD.,"proud young head very firmly.  As soon as they reached the Castle,"
1752,THE TRUE LORD.,"Philip strode with the step and bearing of a man to the ball-room, at"
1753,THE TRUE LORD.,the head of which stood the Earl and Countess in a gay circle of
1754,THE TRUE LORD.,"friends.  They pleasantly welcomed back the lads, but all were struck"
1755,THE TRUE LORD.,"by the paleness of the two faces,--by the look of heroic determination"
1756,THE TRUE LORD.,"in Philip's, and by Arthur's expression of agonized entreaty, as he"
1757,THE TRUE LORD.,clung to the arm of his friend.
1758,THE TRUE LORD.,
1759,THE TRUE LORD.,"With strange clearness and calmness of voice, Philip spoke: ""My Lord,"
1760,THE TRUE LORD.,"and my dear Lady, I have something strange and startling to tell you,"
1761,THE TRUE LORD.,and I desire to say it before all these guests of ours.  _I am not your
1762,THE TRUE LORD.,"son and heir._  There was a fraud perpetrated upon you in my infancy,"
1763,THE TRUE LORD.,"by the nurse, Norah O'Neill, my unhappy mother.  But you suffer no loss"
1764,THE TRUE LORD.,"now; you rather gain, for here, in our dear Arthur, is your _real_ son,"
1765,THE TRUE LORD.,"the true Lord Alverley."""
1766,THE TRUE LORD.,
1767,THE TRUE LORD.,"After a time of blank amazement and incredulity, followed by scores of"
1768,THE TRUE LORD.,"eager questions, which Philip calmly answered, the truth of the strange"
1769,THE TRUE LORD.,"story was admitted, and the Earl and Countess turned to embrace their"
1770,THE TRUE LORD.,new-found son.  But the painful excitement of the scene had been too
1771,THE TRUE LORD.,"much for that grateful, generous heart.  With a piteous look at Philip,"
1772,THE TRUE LORD.,"and a gasping sob, the poor boy fell in a swoon at the feet of his"
1773,THE TRUE LORD.,parents.
1774,THE TRUE LORD.,
1775,THE TRUE LORD.,"Well, the strange, perplexing change about was arranged after a while,"
1776,THE TRUE LORD.,"even to the names of the lads, and Philip became plain Arthur O'Neill,"
1777,THE TRUE LORD.,"and Arthur found himself Philip Alfred Reginald, Lord Alverley, &c."
1778,THE TRUE LORD.,
1779,THE TRUE LORD.,It was long before he was fully reconciled to the greatness thrust upon
1780,THE TRUE LORD.,him at the expense of his best friend.  He hated his title like a born
1781,THE TRUE LORD.,"Democrat.  Indeed, it was said that when he was first my-lorded by his"
1782,THE TRUE LORD.,"brother's valet, he flew into a most unbecoming rage.  He took to his"
1783,THE TRUE LORD.,"new condition more kindly, however, when he found that Philip was not"
1784,THE TRUE LORD.,"desperate or unhappy, that he was not too proud to accept from him such"
1785,THE TRUE LORD.,aid in life as an older brother might give.  They went to the
1786,THE TRUE LORD.,University and travelled over the Continent together.  Then Arthur
1787,THE TRUE LORD.,"O'Neill entered the army, and his regiment was soon after ordered to"

1833,THE CONSCRIPT.,"In the wars of the great Napoleon, thousands of French soldiers were"
1834,THE CONSCRIPT.,"raised by conscription,--that is, taken by lot from the working classes."
1835,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1836,THE CONSCRIPT.,"These conscripts, though they generally made good soldiers, often went"
1837,THE CONSCRIPT.,with great unwillingness and even sorrow from their humble homes and
1838,THE CONSCRIPT.,"their loved ones, to endure the hardships of weary campaigns, to risk"
1839,THE CONSCRIPT.,"life and limb in desperate battles, for they scarcely knew what, with"
1840,THE CONSCRIPT.,people against whom they had no ill-will.
1841,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1842,THE CONSCRIPT.,"On a cloudy morning in early May, a company of conscripts were marched"
1843,THE CONSCRIPT.,away from a pleasant little hamlet in the South of France.  For some
1844,THE CONSCRIPT.,"distance on their way they were followed by loving friends, some"
1845,THE CONSCRIPT.,weeping and some bravely striving to cheer them up.
1846,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1847,THE CONSCRIPT.,"At last these fell off, and the conscripts pursued their march in"
1848,THE CONSCRIPT.,"melancholy silence.  On the brow of a hill, their road passed the gates"
1849,THE CONSCRIPT.,"of an old chateau, the seat of the ancient lords of the manor, the"
1850,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Counts De Lorme.  The present Count, an old man, had lately been"
1851,THE CONSCRIPT.,"permitted to return from exile in England, to his half-ruined estate;"
1852,THE CONSCRIPT.,"but, in acknowledgment for this act of clemency, he had felt obliged to"
1853,THE CONSCRIPT.,"offer to the service of the Emperor his only son, who was now a captain"
1854,THE CONSCRIPT.,in the grand army.
1855,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1856,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Just outside the gates, on this morning, stood Count De Lorme,"
1857,THE CONSCRIPT.,evidently awaiting the conscripts.  He addressed a few words to the
1858,THE CONSCRIPT.,"sergeant, who brought his men to a halt, and called forward one Jean"
1859,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Moreau, a tall, sturdy young man, with a frank, honest face, now sadly"

1861,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1862,THE CONSCRIPT.,"""Well, Jean,"" said the old nobleman, kindly shaking the conscript's"

1884,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Jean Moreau, the handsome young blacksmith, left in his native hamlet a"
1885,THE CONSCRIPT.,"widowed mother, a good, sensible woman, formerly nurse at the chateau,"
1886,THE CONSCRIPT.,"but who, since the Revolution, had adopted the calling of a"
1887,THE CONSCRIPT.,"_blanchisseuse_, or laundress.  ""Mother Moreau,"" as everybody called"
1888,THE CONSCRIPT.,"her, had another son than Jean, fortunately too young to be drafted as"
1889,THE CONSCRIPT.,"a conscript.  Years before, this good woman had taken home a poor"
1890,THE CONSCRIPT.,"little orphan girl, who had grown up to be as a daughter to her, and"
1891,THE CONSCRIPT.,"more than a sister to Jean.  Marie Lenoir, the pretty young"
1892,THE CONSCRIPT.,"_blanchisseuse_, was in truth his betrothed wife.  The little bouquet"
1893,THE CONSCRIPT.,of May rosebuds and forget-me-nots in his button-hole was her parting
1894,THE CONSCRIPT.,gift.  As on the hill by the chateau he turned for his last look at the
1895,THE CONSCRIPT.,"dear little hamlet, nestled in the pleasant valley, he was not ashamed"
1896,THE CONSCRIPT.,"to press those flowers to his lips,--not ashamed of the tears that fell"
1897,THE CONSCRIPT.,on them.  He was too manly to fear being thought unmanly.
1898,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1899,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Months went by,--months of sad anxiety to Mother Moreau and Marie"
1900,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Lenoir, for they heard very unfrequently from Jean, and knew that he"
1901,THE CONSCRIPT.,"was always in danger.  He did not take kindly to a soldier's life, but"
1902,THE CONSCRIPT.,"he tried faithfully to do his duty, so could not be altogether unhappy."
1903,THE CONSCRIPT.,"After he had once seen the great Emperor, he felt the enthusiasm which"
1904,THE CONSCRIPT.,"that wonderful man always inspired, and longed to do something grand to"
1905,THE CONSCRIPT.,"merit his praise.  Then, by a strange and happy chance, he found"
1906,THE CONSCRIPT.,"himself in the same regiment with his beloved foster-brother, Captain"
1907,THE CONSCRIPT.,De Lorme.
1908,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1909,THE CONSCRIPT.,At length there rang over France the news of the great battle of
1910,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Austerlitz, where the Emperor commanded in person, and defeated his"
1911,THE CONSCRIPT.,"foes with fearful slaughter.  After a time of painful suspense, the"
1912,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Count De Lorme had word that his son had been badly wounded, and set"
1913,THE CONSCRIPT.,out at once for the hospital in which the young officer had been left.
1914,THE CONSCRIPT.,"But many weeks went by, and no tidings, good or evil, came to the"
1915,THE CONSCRIPT.,"friends of the conscript.  Mother Moreau, who was a brave woman, inured"
1916,THE CONSCRIPT.,"to trouble, kept up a hopeful heart; but Marie Lenoir rapidly lost the"
1917,THE CONSCRIPT.,"roses from her cheeks and the spring from her step, while the laughing"
1918,THE CONSCRIPT.,light of her soft brown eyes gave place to a look of sadness and fear.
1919,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1920,THE CONSCRIPT.,"But where was Jean?  Not dead, as his friends feared.  Not buried"
1921,THE CONSCRIPT.,"forever out of their loving sight, in the soldier's crowded and bloody"
1922,THE CONSCRIPT.,grave.  He was lying at the same hospital which had received his
1923,THE CONSCRIPT.,"foster-brother, very ill from several severe wounds; and when at last"
1924,THE CONSCRIPT.,"he rose from his bed, and staggered out into the court, one sleeve of"
1925,THE CONSCRIPT.,his military coat hung limp and empty at his side.  If Jean Moreau had
1926,THE CONSCRIPT.,"not given his life for Captain Henri, he had laid down in his service"
1927,THE CONSCRIPT.,"what was almost as dear,--his good right arm.  This was the story of"
1928,THE CONSCRIPT.,"it.  In a part of the field where the battle raged most fiercely,"
1929,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Captain De Lorme's company, in which Jean was then enrolled, was"
1930,THE CONSCRIPT.,"engaged.  At one time they were right under the eye of the Emperor, and"
1931,THE CONSCRIPT.,fought with renewed ardor and courage.
1932,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1933,THE CONSCRIPT.,"The enemy was in great force here, and desperate charges were made on"
1934,THE CONSCRIPT.,"both sides.  Seeing the standard-bearer of his regiment fall, and the"
1935,THE CONSCRIPT.,"banner in the hands of the enemy, Captain De Lorme dashed forward to"
1936,THE CONSCRIPT.,"recover it.  This he did, and was gallantly fighting his way back to"
1937,THE CONSCRIPT.,"the French ranks, when he fell, pierced in the breast by a ball, and"
1938,THE CONSCRIPT.,bleeding from more than one bayonet-thrust.  In an instant there stood
1939,THE CONSCRIPT.,"over him the tall, powerful form of the young blacksmith.  Flinging"
1940,THE CONSCRIPT.,"down his musket, and seizing the sword which the wounded officer had"
1941,THE CONSCRIPT.,"dropped, he kept off all assailants, or cut them down with terrible"
1942,THE CONSCRIPT.,"strokes of that keen and bloody weapon, flashing about him, here,"
1943,THE CONSCRIPT.,"there, on every side, like red lightning.  Lifting the fainting young"
1944,THE CONSCRIPT.,"noble, together with the standard, and bearing them on his left arm,"
1945,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Jean actually fought his way out of the enemy's ranks, step by step,"
1946,THE CONSCRIPT.,"defending both his precious charges.  He received several wounds, but"
1947,THE CONSCRIPT.,"none that disabled him, till a musket-ball went crashing through the"
1948,THE CONSCRIPT.,"bones of his right arm, and it dropped helpless at his side.  When at"
1949,THE CONSCRIPT.,"last he fell, and closed his brave eyes in a long, deep swoon, which he"
1950,THE CONSCRIPT.,"believed the sleep of death, he was at the foot of a little eminence on"
1951,THE CONSCRIPT.,"which Napoleon sat on his war-horse, surveying the terrible scene of"
1952,THE CONSCRIPT.,"carnage,--the surging sea of battle that raged around him.  Jean"
1953,THE CONSCRIPT.,wondered if the smoke of the cannon veiled from his calm eyes the agony
1954,THE CONSCRIPT.,"of dying men, and if their groans came to his ears between the volleys"
1955,THE CONSCRIPT.,"of musketry, in the pauses of stormy battle music."
1956,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1957,THE CONSCRIPT.,"As soon as Jean was able to leave his ward, he was permitted to visit"
1958,THE CONSCRIPT.,"his captain, who, however, was still very low from a fever induced by"
1959,THE CONSCRIPT.,"his wounds.  For the most time he was unconscious or delirious, and"
1960,THE CONSCRIPT.,"recognized no one.  The old Count was with him, but evidently knew not"
1961,THE CONSCRIPT.,"who had saved the life that flickered faintly in the breast of his son,"
1962,THE CONSCRIPT.,and Jean was not the man to inform him.
1963,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1964,THE CONSCRIPT.,"About a fortnight later, near the close of a weary day, two discharged"
1965,THE CONSCRIPT.,and maimed soldiers approached the secluded hamlet of De Lorme.  The
1966,THE CONSCRIPT.,"elder was crippled by a shot in the knee, the younger had lost an"
1967,THE CONSCRIPT.,"arm,--his right arm.  He was pale and thin from illness, and on one"
1968,THE CONSCRIPT.,"cheek was a bright red seam, from a deep sabre-cut.  So Jean, the"
1969,THE CONSCRIPT.,"handsome young conscript, came home."
1970,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1971,THE CONSCRIPT.,"He had borne his misfortune very cheerfully at first, but now at every"
1972,THE CONSCRIPT.,"step he grew gloomy and lost courage.  To his comrade, Jaques Paval, he"
1973,THE CONSCRIPT.,frankly confided his trouble.
1974,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1975,THE CONSCRIPT.,"It was a fear that, maimed and disfigured as he was, his Marie would no"
1976,THE CONSCRIPT.,longer be willing to accept him for her husband.  This fear grew so
1977,THE CONSCRIPT.,"strong on him, that, when they came in sight of the dear old cottage,"
1978,THE CONSCRIPT.,"he paused in an olive-grove, and sent his friend forward to prepare his"
1979,THE CONSCRIPT.,betrothed and his mother for the sad change they must see in him.
1980,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1981,THE CONSCRIPT.,[Illustration: He paused in an olive-grove.]
1982,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1983,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Jaques found Marie leaning over the gate, looking down the street.  She"
1984,THE CONSCRIPT.,was always looking out for returned soldiers now.  She seemed
1985,THE CONSCRIPT.,"disappointed that Jaques was not Jean, but greeted him kindly, and soon"
1986,THE CONSCRIPT.,drew from him all he had to tell of her doubting lover.  Calling Mother
1987,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Moreau, and Jean's young brother, she ran before them down the street,"
1988,THE CONSCRIPT.,and soon cheered the sinking heart under the olive-trees with a glad
1989,THE CONSCRIPT.,"embrace and a welcome home.  Then came the young brother, laughing loud"
1990,THE CONSCRIPT.,"to keep from crying, and affecting not to see that dangling"
1991,THE CONSCRIPT.,"coat-sleeve, or to miss the grasp of the lost right hand.  Then the"
1992,THE CONSCRIPT.,"mother, thanking God, as she fell on the breast of her son, putting the"
1993,THE CONSCRIPT.,hair from his scarred forehead and blessing him.  Pretty Marie had
1994,THE CONSCRIPT.,"shrunk a little from that ugly red mark on his cheek, but the mother"
1995,THE CONSCRIPT.,"kissed that very spot most tenderly, with murmurs of pitying love."
1996,THE CONSCRIPT.,
1997,THE CONSCRIPT.,"The next day, Jean generously offered to free Marie from her"
1998,THE CONSCRIPT.,"engagement; but she would not be freed, reproaching him with tears for"
1999,THE CONSCRIPT.,thinking so poorly of her as to suppose she would forsake him when he
2000,THE CONSCRIPT.,needed her most.
2001,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2002,THE CONSCRIPT.,"""But, Marie,"" he said, ""we shall be so poor.  My pension will be small,"
2003,THE CONSCRIPT.,"and I can do little with only a left arm."""
2004,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2005,THE CONSCRIPT.,"""But, Jean, I am young and strong, and--"""
2006,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2007,THE CONSCRIPT.,"""God and the saints will help us,"" interposed Mother Moreau."
2008,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2009,THE CONSCRIPT.,Jean and Marie responded by silently crossing themselves; and the
2010,THE CONSCRIPT.,marriage was fixed for the first Sunday of the next month.
2011,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2012,THE CONSCRIPT.,"On the evening before the wedding the Count De Lorme, who had lately"
2013,THE CONSCRIPT.,"returned to the chateau, sent word to Mother Moreau, that, with the"
2014,THE CONSCRIPT.,"permission of the wedding-party, he would be present at the church, to"
2015,THE CONSCRIPT.,give away the bride.
2016,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2017,THE CONSCRIPT.,"With that perfect punctuality which is a part of true politeness, he"
2018,THE CONSCRIPT.,"came at the exact time appointed; and, leaning on his arm, there came a"
2019,THE CONSCRIPT.,"slight, pale young officer, Captain Henri, now Colonel De Lorme.  With"
2020,THE CONSCRIPT.,"respectful eagerness Jean stepped forward to greet him, and, in his joy"
2021,THE CONSCRIPT.,"and faithful devotion, would have kissed the hand held forth, but that"
2022,THE CONSCRIPT.,"De Lorme, with a sudden impulse of affection, extended his arms, and"
2023,THE CONSCRIPT.,"the brothers in heart embraced.  This is a custom in France with men,"
2024,THE CONSCRIPT.,but only when they are equal in rank.  At this moment the young noble
2025,THE CONSCRIPT.,caught sight of that mournful empty sleeve.  A look of pain crossed his
2026,THE CONSCRIPT.,face; he gently lifted the sleeve and pressed it to his lips.
2027,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2028,THE CONSCRIPT.,"""Jean,"" he said at last, in a soft, unsteady voice, ""I bring you good"
2029,THE CONSCRIPT.,news!  The Emperor himself witnessed your gallant conduct in rescuing
2030,THE CONSCRIPT.,"me and our colors, and if you had not been disabled, you would have"
2031,THE CONSCRIPT.,"been promoted.  As it is, you will receive the pension of a lieutenant."
2032,THE CONSCRIPT.,"And, Jean, I give you joy, _mon frère_ (my brother), _he_ sends you"
2033,THE CONSCRIPT.,"_this_, the highest reward of a brave soldier of France, the best"
2034,THE CONSCRIPT.,"wedding present for a hero."""
2035,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2036,THE CONSCRIPT.,With these words the young Colonel placed on the breast of the poor
2037,THE CONSCRIPT.,"conscript a shining ornament,--the grand cross of the Legion of Honor!"
2038,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2039,THE CONSCRIPT.,So the wedding of Jean and Marie was a merry one after all.  The good
2040,THE CONSCRIPT.,"old Count not only gave away the bride, but gave with her a nice little"
2041,THE CONSCRIPT.,"_dot_, or portion.  All the villagers who were rich enough gave them"
2042,THE CONSCRIPT.,"presents, and the poor gave blessings, which doubtless turned into good"
2043,THE CONSCRIPT.,things in time.
2044,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2045,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Marie Moreau proved such an energetic, devoted wife, that Jean felt"
2046,THE CONSCRIPT.,that he had more than got his right arm back again; yet he was no
2047,THE CONSCRIPT.,"idler, for he found that with practice he could do many things with his"
2048,THE CONSCRIPT.,"left arm, and at length adopted the business of a vine-grower."
2049,THE CONSCRIPT.,
2050,THE CONSCRIPT.,"As he grew older, his beard grew heavier, so that in a few years little"
2051,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Henri, his son, had to part, with his chubby fingers, the thick, crisp"
2052,THE CONSCRIPT.,"hair, to get at that sabre-scar, when he wanted to hear the story of"
2053,THE CONSCRIPT.,"the hard fight for the young captain and the banner, and of the great"
2054,THE CONSCRIPT.,"Emperor on the hill overlooking everything with his keen, gray,"
2055,THE CONSCRIPT.,unflinching eyes.

2099,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2100,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,A scene very similar to those we so often witnessed during the sad days
2101,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"of our war, occurred one sweet June morning, about sixty years ago, in"
2102,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"a quaint little village in Switzerland, on the borders of France.  A"
2103,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,company of recruits were about departing to join a regiment in a
2104,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"neighboring town, from whence they were to march to Italy, where"
2105,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Napoleon, then First Consul, was conducting one of his great campaigns."
2106,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Around these recruits, all of them young, gathered their friends and"
2107,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"relatives, with tears and embraces and touching words of farewell."
2108,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2109,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"About a young drummer-boy, named Leopold Koerner, gathered a little"
2110,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"group on whose grief few could look without tears.  First, around the"
2111,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"lad's neck clung his pretty blue-eyed sister, Madeline; then his"
2112,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"younger brother Heinrich, ever till this day a merry, light-hearted"
2113,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"little fellow.  Then came their sturdy old grandmother, trying to put a"
2114,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"brave face on the matter, and winking vigorously to keep back the"
2115,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,tears.  Leopold's father had been killed in the great French
2116,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Revolution,--his widow had died soon after, ""of a decline,"" it was"
2117,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"said; but doubtless sorrow helped her on toward the great, sweet rest."
2118,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,The children were left to the sole care of their grandmother.  She was
2119,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"poor and old, but she had a stout, faithful heart,--she was devout and"
2120,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"determined, and battled with want and poverty like a true soldier of"
2121,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"the Lord.  She kept the children together, and brought them up ""in the"
2122,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"way they should go."""
2123,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2124,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,It was for the sake of relieving this noble old friend of some of her
2125,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"heavy care, more than from any love of a soldier's life, that Leopold,"
2126,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"at the age of fourteen, enlisted as a drummer."
2127,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2128,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"At parting with her darling, the good woman said little, but to charge"
2129,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"him to remember his father's honesty and bravery, his mother's"
2130,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"goodness, and the love of the true hearts left behind him.  ""Make all"
2131,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"thy noise with thy drum, lad; neither boast nor swear, and remember,"
2132,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"the better man the better soldier."""
2133,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2134,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Keep up good heart, brother,"" said Heinrich, with a quivering lip,"
2135,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""thou wilt come back to us some day, safe and sound, a grand"
2136,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"officer,--the General of all the drummers."""
2137,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2138,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Adieu, dear Leopold,"" sobbed Madeline; ""O, what can I do without thee?"
2139,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,I pray the holy saints and angels to turn the bullets away from thee.
2140,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,Take with thee our mother's prayer-book.  The _Forget-me-nots_ pressed
2141,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,in it are from her grave.  I shall cry my prayers now; but they will
2142,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"all be for thee.  Adieu! adieu!"""
2143,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2144,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Just then came the command, ""Forward, march!""  Leopold hastily thrust"
2145,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"his sister's gift into his bosom, kissed her for the last time, and"
2146,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"with a sad wave of the hand to his old friends, moved on in his place,"
2147,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"sturdily beating his drum, a tear-drop falling at every stroke."
2148,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2149,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Leopold first saw real hard fighting in Italy, at the great battle of"
2150,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Marengo.  In the early part of the engagement, as his regiment was"
2151,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"marching past a little hill, on which were a group of mounted officers,"
2152,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Leopold's boyish eye was caught by the figure of a tall, handsome young"
2153,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"general, mounted on a magnificent white horse.  He was very singularly"
2154,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"and splendidly dressed, in a rich Eastern-looking uniform, of scarlet,"
2155,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"azure, and gold.  At his side hung a diamond-hilted sword, suspended by"
2156,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,a girdle of gold brocade.  On his head he wore a three-cornered
2157,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"chapeau, from which rose a long, white ostrich plume, and a superb"
2158,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,heron feather.  The band that held these was clasped with brilliants of
2159,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,great value.
2160,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2161,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Ah, there is the great General Bonaparte!"" cried Leopold, to a"
2162,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"comrade.  ""I knew him at a glance."""
2163,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2164,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Which, my lad?"""
2165,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2166,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Why, that splendid officer, talking to the pale little man, in a gray"
2167,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"surtout and leather breeches."""
2168,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2169,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Ah, no, my little comrade,"" replied the other drummer, laughing, ""that"
2170,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"is Murat, General of Cavalry,--the little man in the gray surtout is"
2171,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General Bonaparte.  However, you need not blush for your hero; he is a"
2172,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,wonderful fellow at the head of a charge.  Wherever his white plume
2173,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"goes, victory follows.  You should see Bonaparte watch it, gleaming"
2174,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"above the fight, as the French cavalry goes thundering up against"
2175,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,Austrian bayonets or batteries.  They say the mad general sometimes
2176,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"shouts to the Austrian dragoons, 'Ho! who of you wants Murat's jewels?"
2177,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Let him come and take them!'  And they come one after another, to go"
2178,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"down under his sword, which falls upon them swift and sure as the"
2179,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"lightning.  Ah! he is a terrible fellow."""
2180,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2181,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,Leopold found a battle to be something yet more awful than he had
2182,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"imagined.  The roar of artillery, the rattle of musketry, the clang of"
2183,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"swords and bayonets, the stormy gallop of cavalry, the groans and"
2184,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"shrieks of wounded and dying men, appalled his very soul.  But though"
2185,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"his cheeks grew deathly white, and his eyes large and wild, he had not"
2186,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"one cowardly impulse to fly from his duty.  Again and again, he gave"
2187,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,the quick drum-beat for the advance.
2188,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2189,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"In the height of the battle, Murat dashed forward in one of his"
2190,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"overpowering cavalry charges.  Leopold, in the midst of the horrors of"
2191,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"the fight, gazed with wonder and admiration at the plumed and jewelled"
2192,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"officer, on his magnificent white horse, with its trappings of gold and"
2193,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"azure.  It was like a beautiful vision in that awful place, and a wild"
2194,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,huzza broke from the boy's lips.  Just then a cannon-ball rushed before
2195,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"him, like a small whirlwind, and carried away his drum, in a thousand"
2196,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,fragments.  He saw the same ball pass harmlessly between the legs of
2197,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"the white horse of Murat, who was then engaged in a hand-to-hand combat"
2198,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"with a tall Austrian dragoon.  Relieved from duty, the boy stood"
2199,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"watching the fiery general, forgetful of danger, scarcely hearing the"
2200,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,horrible singing of the bullets through the air.  He saw the tall
2201,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"dragoon go down, and another dash forward to fill his place.  While"
2202,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General Murat was dealing with him, Leopold saw an Austrian officer"
2203,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"spur forward, and wheel sharply a powerful black horse, with the intent"
2204,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,to attack the rash French hero from behind.  While his followers were
2205,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"engaging those of Murat, he plunged forward, with his gleaming sword"
2206,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"lifted high in air.  Leopold never know how he did it, but he broke"
2207,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"frantically through the ranks of infantry, in among the furious,"
2208,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"trampling cavalry, at the last moment, seized the Austrian's black"
2209,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"horse by the bit, and throwing his whole weight upon it, brought him to"
2210,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"his knees.  As he did so, he screamed at the top of his voice, ""This"
2211,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"way, General Murat!""  The consequence was, that the sword that would"
2212,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"have struck down his general, fell on his own presumptuous arm, nearly"
2213,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"severing it from his shoulder.  But on the instant, the white-plumed"
2214,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"hero wheeled, with his avenging sword uplifted, and the next thing the"
2215,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"drummer-boy saw, as he lay bleeding on the ground, was a great black"
2216,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,horse dashing riderless away.
2217,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2218,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General Murat saw at once the great service Leopold had done him, and"
2219,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"all that the daring act had cost the poor lad.  He paused there, and"
2220,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"stood guard over the boy, till he had seen him carefully removed to the"
2221,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"rear.  Then with his sword in one hand, a pistol in the other, and the"
2222,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"bridle in his teeth, he dashed forward again in a last wild, tremendous"
2223,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"charge, which carried the day for the French."
2224,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2225,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"The next morning, Leopold found himself an inmate of the crowded"
2226,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"hospital, surrounded with the wounded and the maimed, the fevered and"
2227,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"the dying.  But he was especially well cared for, at the command of"
2228,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General Murat, to whose interest perhaps it was owing that his arm was"
2229,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"saved, as at first the surgeons were for taking it off, and so making"
2230,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"an end of a troublesome job.  But with skilful treatment, aided by the"
2231,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"lad's youth, good habits, and patience, the great wound healed at last."
2232,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2233,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"One day, while Leopold yet lay on his cot, forbidden to stir, and"
2234,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"feeling very lonely and homesick, the dreary hospital was illuminated"
2235,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"by the entrance of General Murat, accompanied by his beautiful young"
2236,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"wife, who was a sister of General Bonaparte.  After bowing graciously"
2237,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"to the other patients, they came to the little drummer-boy.  The"
2238,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General inquired kindly after his wound, and Madame Murat thanked him"
2239,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,in the sweetest manner for saving the life of her husband.
2240,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2241,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Glory gives you a rough hand-shake at first, eh, my lad?  But, never"
2242,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"mind; it is a brusque way she has,"" said the General, smiling."
2243,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2244,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""I am thankful that she did not shake my hand off altogether, my"
2245,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General,"" replied Leopold.  ""I fear as it is, 't will be long ere I can"
2246,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"hope to help drum the way to another victory."""
2247,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2248,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Ah, well, my child, when you get strong enough to handle the"
2249,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"drum-sticks, we may find better work for you.  We shall see.  Adieu!"""
2250,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2251,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""Adieu, my General!  Adieu, Madame!"""
2252,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2253,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"Well, when Leopold applied for his old position in his regiment, he was"
2254,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"informed by his Colonel that he was to be sent to the Polytechnic, a"
2255,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"military school in Paris, to be educated for a cavalry officer, under"
2256,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,the patronage of General Murat.  This was a great up-lift in life for a
2257,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,poor peasant-boy; but he received the news with modest gratitude and
2258,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"joy, unmingled with the faintest trace of pride or conceit."
2259,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2260,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"He obtained leave to visit his home on his way to Paris, and never"
2261,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"forgot that humble home or its inmates, as he got on in his profession."
2262,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"He proved to be a good student, and grew up into a fine, soldier-like,"
2263,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,honorable man.
2264,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2265,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"General Murat and his wife continued to befriend him, even after they"
2266,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,became king and queen of Naples.
2267,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2268,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"In the battles of the Empire, the young lieutenant of cavalry so"
2269,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"distinguished himself that he rose to a high rank.  So one day, before"
2270,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"his brown hair was turned gray, and before his good grandmother's white"
2271,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"head had been hidden in the grave, Leopold Koerner entered his native"
2272,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"village a General,--though not as his brother Heinrich had prophesied,"
2273,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"""the General of all the drummers."""
2274,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,
2275,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,This was not his first visit home after leaving the Polytechnic.  Once
2276,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"he had returned to purchase, with his well-saved pay, a small property"
2277,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"for his brother, who had chosen the peaceful calling of a miller; and"
2278,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,"once again, to give away in marriage his sweet sister Madeline, who"
2279,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,became the wife of the village Notary.
2280,THE DRUMMER-BOY.,

2317,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"tempestuous night.  The wind was raving round the little inn, and"
2318,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"tearing away at windows and doors, as though mad to get at the brave"

2332,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,When the officer threw aside his plumed hat and military cloak of rich

2335,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"gruff host was greatly impressed with his importance, and willingly"

2366,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"early, and took him off in his boat.  I took him in for pity; but I"

2384,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Yes, just alive.  He must be very old, for he is almost stone blind"

2394,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"General Wallenstein bent over the dog, touched him gently, and shouted"
2395,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"in his ear his old name of ""Leon.""  The dog had not forgotten it; he"
2396,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"knew that voice, the touch of that hand.  With a plaintive, joyful cry,"
2397,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"he sprang up to the breast of his old master, nestled about blindly for"
2398,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"his hands, and licked them unreproved; then sunk down, as though faint"
2399,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"with joy, to his master's feet.  The brave soldier was overcome with"
2400,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"emotion; tears fell fast from his eyes.  ""Faithful creature,"" he"
2401,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"exclaimed, ""you have saved my child, and given him back to me.""  And"
2402,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"kneeling down, he laid his hand on the head of the poor old dog and"
2403,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,blessed him.
2404,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2405,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Just at this moment the door opened and little Carl appeared, toiling"

2408,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2409,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Come hither, Carl,"" said the soldier.  The boy flung down his fagots"

2412,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Dost thou know who I am?"""
2413,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2414,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Ah no,--the good Christmas King, perhaps,"" said the little lad,"
2415,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,looking full of innocent wonderment.
2416,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2417,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""Alas, poor child, how shouldst thou remember me!"" exclaimed General"
2418,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"Wallenstein, sadly.  Then clasping him in his arms, he said, ""But I"
2419,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"remember thee; thou art my boy, my dear, long-lost boy!  Look in my"

2421,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2422,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"""No, surely,"" said the child, sorely bewildered, ""that cannot be, for"

2424,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,
2425,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"The soldier smiled through his tears, and soon was able to convince his"
2426,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,little son that he had a better father than the old river that had
2427,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,carried him away from his tender parents.  He told him of a loving
2428,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"mother who yet sorrowed for him, and of a little blue-eyed sister, who"
2429,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"would rejoice when he came.  Carl listened, and wondered, and laughed,"
2430,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"and when he comprehended it all, slid from his father's arms and ran to"

2437,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"the little bare feet of the child were thrust out from their covering,"
2438,LITTLE CARL'S CHRISTMAS-EVE.,"it was only to bury themselves in the shaggy coat of old Leon, who lay"

2480,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Austrians and the Italians, a poor peasant-woman lay dying.  Beside her"
2481,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"bed stood a fine, sturdy-looking lad, some fourteen years of age,"
2482,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"listening reverently to the last words of his mother.  On the bed, with"
2483,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"her face hidden against that dear mother's breast, lay a little girl of"
2484,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"six or seven, trying to keep down her sobs, and to take into her"
2485,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"half-broken little heart the fond farewells, the tender and solemn"

2487,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2488,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"The dying mother grieved to leave her poor children alone in the world,"
2489,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"for they were fatherless, and had no near relatives; but she believed"
2490,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,that the same Heavenly Father who was calling her from them would care
2491,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,for them and bring them home to her at last.  To the tender love of
2492,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"that Father, and to the protection of the holy saints, she commended"

2495,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2496,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"After the burial of their mother, Giuseppe and Lucia found themselves"
2497,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"nearly penniless.  They had no friends except among the poor, so they"
2498,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"must help themselves, or suffer extreme poverty.  The boy possessed a"
2499,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"great deal of musical talent, and played well upon several instruments."
2500,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,He resolved that somehow he would make this talent serve for the
2501,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,support of himself and his little sister.  He could have enlisted as a
2502,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"drummer, but he regarded the Austrians, who then held that part of"
2503,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Italy, as the cruel oppressors of his country.  He had an especial"
2504,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"horror of them, from the fact that his father had been shot several"
2505,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"years before, for joining an unsuccessful rising against them in Milan."
2506,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2507,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"At last, Giuseppe Benedetti fixed upon a calling.  With the small sum"
2508,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,of money which a sale of the cottage furniture brought he purchased a
2509,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"set of puppets, or _marionettes_,--quaint little figures, that would"
2510,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"dance very nimbly if not gracefully to the notes of the pipes, which he"
2511,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"played like a master.  This is a rather rude, but quite an inspiring"
2512,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"musical instrument, belonging mostly to the mountain regions of Italy."
2513,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Those who play it are called _pifferari_, or pipers."
2514,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2515,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"When all was ready, Giuseppe and Lucia took an affectionate leave of"
2516,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"their kind neighbors, and set bravely out on their travels, to seek"
2517,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"their fortune.  They tramped from town to town, sometimes getting very"
2518,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"weary and discouraged, but often having very pleasant times together,"
2519,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,and never suffering from actual want.  One day they found themselves
2520,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"within a few hours' walk of Mancini, the little village in which their"
2521,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"mother had died, and concluded to revisit it.  At noon, they stopped to"
2522,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,rest in an olive-grove by the wayside.  After eating their simple
2523,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"dinner of brown bread and fresh figs, and drinking from a cool spring"
2524,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"near by, Lucia, who never tired of the wonderful performances of the"
2525,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"marionettes, asked her brother to play for them, and sat watching the"
2526,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,dancing of the miniature men and women with true childish delight.
2527,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2528,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"In the midst of their enjoyment, they were startled by the tramp of"
2529,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"horses and men coming up the road.  Giuseppe ran forwards, and looked"
2530,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"down on a band of some two hundred Italian soldiers, led by a"
2531,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"noble-looking man, mounted on a fiery white horse; but wearing, instead"
2532,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"of a showy uniform, a red-flannel shirt, gray trousers, and a slouched"
2533,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"felt hat.  As this officer saw Giuseppe standing on the high bank, with"
2534,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"little Lucia behind him, peering timidly between his legs, he reined up"
2535,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"horse, and asked in a voice sweet and sad, yet grand and commanding, if"
2536,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,there was a spring of water near by.  Giuseppe replied by offering to
2537,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"show him the one he had found, and soon conducted him and his men to a"
2538,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"little green nook, where the water gushed up sweet and fresh.  The lad"
2539,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,noticed that the noble-looking leader waited till all his soldiers had
2540,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,quenched their thirst before he drank.
2541,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2542,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"When he was ready to resume the march, he thanked the peasant-boy, and"

2550,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2551,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"The General started, and asked how he knew him."

2553,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""My father served under you at the siege of Rome, and he had a picture"

2558,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""He was shot at Milan, General."""
2559,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2560,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"The noble face of Garibaldi grew stern, but softened again as he looked"
2561,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,pityingly on the orphans.  After giving them a little money--he was
2562,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,himself too poor to give them much--he turned away and began consulting
2563,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,with one of his officers in regard to their march.  Giuseppe understood
2564,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"that their plan was to go on to Mancini, where they expected to raise"
2565,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"some more men, and to camp for the night near the village.  After a few"
2566,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"energetic words away he dashed, followed by his brave, devoted band."
2567,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2568,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"When they were gone, Giuseppe and Lucia lay down on the soft turf, and"
2569,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"talked of all they had seen and heard, till, overcome by the heat and"
2570,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"lulled by the murmur of the brook, they fell asleep.  They slept till"
2571,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"late in the afternoon, when they were awakened by the tramp of soldiers"
2572,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,again coming up the road.
2573,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2574,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""Here comes more of our brave Italians,"" exclaimed Lucia."

2576,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""No, these are Austrians,"" said Giuseppe, looking down upon them from"

2581,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2582,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Just then an Austrian officer caught sight of the lad, and leaped his"

2589,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,speak.  But poor Lucia could not see her brother murdered; she flung
2590,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"herself between him and the officer, crying out, ""Yes, we _did_ see"
2591,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"him; but please don't hurt him, or any of his brave soldiers."""

2595,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"The Austrian laughed a cruel sort of a laugh, and asked, ""Which way did"
2596,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"they go?"""
2597,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2598,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Poor Lucia could not say any more for sobbing, but pointed with her"
2599,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"hand up the road,--never in her innocence thinking of misleading him."
2600,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"It was enough; in another moment he was leading on his men, with the"
2601,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,hope of soon surprising and destroying the Italians.
2602,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2603,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"When they were out of hearing, Giuseppe flung himself on the ground,"
2604,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"crying bitterly.  ""Ah, little Lucia,"" he said, ""how could you betray"
2605,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"our General, the hope of Italy?  Why did you not let the Austrian kill"
2606,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"me?"""
2607,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2608,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""O brother, brother,"" replied the child, weeping, ""how _could_ I let"
2609,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"him?  I love _you_ better even than Garibaldi; besides, he is such a"
2610,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"great fighter, may be he will kill them all."""
2611,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2612,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""No, no,"" groaned the poor lad, ""they are too many for him, if they"
2613,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"take him by surprise."""
2614,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2615,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Suddenly he sprang up, his face looking all bright and eager, and said,"
2616,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""Little sister, now you have done our General so much mischief, are you"
2617,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"brave enough to try to save him?"""
2618,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2619,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""Why, what can such a little thing as I do?"""
2620,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2621,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""I will tell you.  You can stay here with the pipes and marionettes,"
2622,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"while I run over the mountain by a little path,--a cross-cut I"
2623,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"know,--and warn Garibaldi that the Austrians are after him.  I will be"
2624,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"back by midnight, I hope, but you must stay here till I come; there"
2625,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"will be moonlight, and it will not be cold.  Dare you stay alone?"""
2626,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2627,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"""Yes,"" answered Lucia, firmly, though turning quite pale; ""the blessed"
2628,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Mother of our Lord will watch over me, and may be our mother will come"
2629,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"with her.  I think she 's a saint; I am sure she ought to be made one."""
2630,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2631,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"With a tender kiss on the lips of his heroic little sister, Giuseppe"
2632,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,sprang away and soon disappeared over a ridge of the mountain.  After
2633,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,some narrow escapes in pursuing his perilous path along precipices and
2634,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"over torrents, he reached Mancini in time not only to warn Garibaldi,"
2635,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,but to allow him to march back through a deep ravine and intercept the
2636,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Austrians.  Taken by surprise, and in the dim evening light mistaking"
2637,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"Garibaldi's dashing little band for a large force, they made little"
2638,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"resistance, but such as were not killed in the first charge, fled or"
2639,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,surrendered.  After sending his prisoners to one of his secret mountain
2640,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"strongholds, Garibaldi despatched a trooper with Giuseppe to the"
2641,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"olive-grove, whore Lucia had been left alone.  They found her safe,"
2642,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"quietly sleeping, with her sweet little face upturned in the soft"
2643,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"moonlight.  The trooper took her up before him, on his strong, black"
2644,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"horse, and the three returned to Garibaldi's camp."
2645,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2646,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,Giuseppe and his little sister remained with the brave mountain men for
2647,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,several weeks.  The little girl became a great pet with the rough but
2648,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"kindly soldiers, and many a night she sat with them beside the"
2649,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"camp-fire, sometimes on Garibaldi's knee, and sung sweet, wild songs,"
2650,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"while Giuseppe played on his pipes, and the funny little marionettes"
2651,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,danced right merrily.
2652,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2653,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"But at last, General Garibaldi found for the good little girl a home"
2654,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"with a kind lady, who promised to bring her up as her own child.  That"
2655,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"home was in a pretty villa, on the lovely shore of Lake Como.  Giuseppe"
2656,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"remained with Garibaldi, and became a soldier."
2657,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,
2658,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"After the Austrians had been driven from Milan, he entered that city in"
2659,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"the suite of his beloved general.  One day, he went to the spot just"
2660,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"outside the walls, where a few years before his poor father was shot."
2661,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"He picked a wild poppy, and put it in his bosom, thinking that it might"
2662,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,be it had received its rich red color from the life-blood of that brave
2663,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"father.  Then, as he looked over the beautiful city, and saw waving"
2664,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"from every public building the banner of the gallant King of Sardinia,"
2665,GIUSEPPE AND LUCIA.,"instead of the ugly flag of Austria, he thanked God for Victor Emanuel,"

2702,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.
2703,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2704,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,How odd it was!  Such a funny little event!  I have often told the
2705,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"story to my one little chick, but it has always seemed to me too absurd"
2706,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,to put into print; yet you see I have finally made up my mind to tell
2707,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,you all about it.
2708,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2709,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"I was seven years old that summer,--seven, ""going on"" eight, as we"
2710,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,country children used to say.  It was the term during which I commenced
2711,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"the study of geography,--dear old Peter Parley's charming little book,"
2712,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"which first formally introduced me to the great world we live in, or"
2713,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"rather on, and first made me realize that it was round, and all that."
2714,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"It was on an afternoon in the early part of July, I am not sure,"
2715,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"though, that it was n't in the latter part of June, that it"
2716,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"happened,--the singular event I am going to tell you about.  It had"
2717,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"been dreadfully hot all day,--so hot that the very hillsides seemed to"
2718,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"pant, like the sides of the poor cattle, in the parched pastures.  I"
2719,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,thought it extremely lucky that my geography lesson that day was in
2720,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,Greenland.  I don't believe I could have been equal to a lesson in
2721,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"Mesopotamia.  I remember saying to Bob Linn, at recess, that I wished I"
2722,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"was a seal, riding on an iceberg; and he said he wished he was a white"
2723,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"bear, climbing the North Pole and sliding down backwards.  That was so"
2724,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,like Bob Linn.  He used to climb the lightning-rod of the
2725,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"meeting-house, and ring the bell at very improper hours, till Deacon"
2726,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"Jones tarred it,--the rod, not the bell.  I wonder where he is"
2727,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"now,--Bob, not the Deacon.  He was the first schoolmate to whom I told"
2728,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"what had happened that July, or June afternoon.  As I think I have"
2729,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"said, it was a very hot day; but, just before school was dismissed,"
2730,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"there came up a refreshing thunder-shower.  How we revived, in the"
2731,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"cool, moist air, like the poor wilted field-flowers!  The shrunken"
2732,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"stream in the glen grew, and took heart, and went tumbling down the"
2733,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"rocks, in its old, headlong spring-fashion.  The cattle stopped panting"
2734,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"and whisking off flies, and stood dripping and chewing, while a smile"
2735,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,of brightening greenness ran over the faded face of the pasture.
2736,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2737,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,I had a half-mile walk home.  One of the girls who lived nearer the
2738,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,school-house invited me to stay all night with her; but I thought that
2739,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"I, who was old enough to study about oceans, avalanches, earthquakes,"
2740,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"and volcanoes, ought not to be afraid of such rain, thunder, and"
2741,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"lightning as we had in our free, enlightened, and Christian country."
2742,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"So I thanked her ""no,"" which was very well; for, if I had stayed, that"
2743,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"wouldn't have happened that did happen,--or, at least, I would n't have"
2744,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"seen it.  Well, I set out for home, bravely breasting the wind, and"
2745,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"really enjoying the rain, in spite of my new sun-bonnet getting every"
2746,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,minute more limp and flappy.  I remember wondering if it was raining at
2747,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"that very time in China, right under my feet.  If so, study on it as I"
2748,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"would, I could n't make it seem any other way than that it rained"
2749,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"upwards there.  I was thinking of such things, and not expecting"
2750,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"anything particular to happen, till I got in sight of home, past the"
2751,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"old Phillips place, where it did happen.  It was here I first noticed"
2752,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"over my head the blackest of black clouds, big with barrels of rain.  I"
2753,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"started into a run, to get out of the way, when--now it is coming, what"
2754,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"I was going to relate!  No, I must first tell you that there was near"
2755,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"me then no house, nor tree, nor even bush, that it could have dropped"
2756,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"or jumped off from.  Now it really is coming!  Well, right down before"
2757,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"my eyes, straight out of that cloud, fell--_a little frog_!!  There, it"
2758,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"is out!  I like to take people by surprise, and not, like some"
2759,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"story-tellers, drag my listeners all ""round Robin Hood's barn"" before I"
2760,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,get at a thing.
2761,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2762,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"I stood stock still for a moment, in wonder and astonishment.  Then,"
2763,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"half afraid, I picked the little creature up out of the sand.  He was"
2764,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"of a greenish-brown, brightening to gold in the sun.  His limbs were"
2765,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"extremely delicate, and his eyes were as bright as diamonds.  I carried"
2766,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"him gently home, and ran with him in the greatest excitement to my"
2767,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"mother, exclaiming, ""O mamma! do look at this lovely little frog!  It"
2768,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,is n't human!  It came right down to me out of the sky.  I do believe
2769,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"it is an angel-frog!"""
2770,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2771,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"My mother laughed, but, on being told the story of Froggy's descent"
2772,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"from the clouds, said it was a great marvel and mystery where he came"
2773,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"from, and how he got there.  Glad of a chance to display my learning, I"
2774,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"said, ""Why, mamma, you know the stars are round balls, like our earth,"
2775,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"swinging in the air; and may be he was whirled off one of them, or"
2776,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"maybe he jumped off the horn of the moon last night, and has been"
2777,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"travelling ever since.  Poor little fellow! how tired he must be!"""
2778,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2779,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"When my father came in, he gave it as his opinion that the frog had"
2780,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"been carried up by a waterspout, from a lake about twenty miles"
2781,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"distant, kept up and borne along by currents of air.  At all events, he"
2782,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"was a hero and an adventurer, and I resolved to keep him as a"
2783,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"curiosity.  So I put him in a large rain-water trough, at the back of"
2784,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"the house, where he lived in apparent content, the monarch of all he"
2785,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"surveyed.  During dry times, I kept him well supplied with fresh water"
2786,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"from the well, and I frequently threw in broad dock-leaves, for him to"
2787,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"take shelter under from the heat.  He soon grew to know me, and would"
2788,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,actually come at my call from the farthest end of the trough.  He was
2789,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"very shy of others, and I was not sorry, for I wanted all his"
2790,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"affection, and was proud of his discernment.  This was thought so"
2791,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"singular that I was often sent out with visitors, to show off my pet."
2792,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,I don't believe that the keeper of the hippopotamus can be prouder of
2793,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,his mud-loving monster than I was of my lively little friend.
2794,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2795,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"My brother Will built for him a neat little ship, on which he sailed"
2796,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"about, being captain, crew, cabin-boy, and all.  One morning, while I"
2797,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"was playing with him, he hopped down the hatchway.  I shut him into the"
2798,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"little cabin, and was careless enough to forget to let him out before"
2799,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"going to school.  When I came home, I found him lying on the cabin"
2800,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"floor, still and lifeless!  He had been suffocated in the close, hot"
2801,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,air.  I am not ashamed to own that I cried heartily over the poor limp
2802,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"little body.  I wrapped it tenderly in a plantain-leaf, and laid it"
2803,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,beside my last lost kitty.
2804,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2805,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"In the evening, when I told my father of my loss, he by no means made"
2806,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"light of it, knowing my pet was no common frog."
2807,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2808,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"""Poor fellow!"" he said, ""it was as bad for him as the 'Black Hole of"
2809,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"Calcutta.'""  I did n't know what that meant then; I know now, but"
2810,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,haven't time to tell you.  Besides it is n't a pleasant story.  Then
2811,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"papa added, ""Perhaps, after all, it is only a case of suspended"
2812,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,animation.  Your little frog may have only been in a swoon.  If you
2813,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"open his grave in the morning, you may find that he has come to."""
2814,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2815,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"That was a pleasant hope to go to bed on, and you may believe I rose"
2816,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"bright and early in the morning, to run with my shingle-spade to the"
2817,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"cemetery of all my dead pets.  With an anxious heart, I removed the"
2818,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"earth, and unfolded the plantain-leaf.  Sure enough, there was my pet,"
2819,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"""alive and kicking!""  He hopped out on to a full-blown dandelion, and"
2820,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"looked about him as pert and knowing as ever.  I caught him up, and ran"
2821,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"with him into the house, crying, ""Froggy is resurrected!--Froggy is"
2822,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"resurrected!"""
2823,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2824,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"After this, nothing especial happened to him for some months.  He grew"
2825,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"in intelligence and lively graces, but not in size, remaining precisely"
2826,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"the same pretty, tiny creature as at the first.  This fairy-like,"
2827,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"unchangeable youthfulness, and his little, piping note, ""most musical,"
2828,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"most melancholy,"" made me still half believe that he was a frog of"
2829,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"another and a higher race than ours,--star-born, or a native of"
2830,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"cloud-land.  After the frosty nights of November, I used to remove the"
2831,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"thin ice from his tank, so that he could swim freely, and he did not"
2832,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"seem to suffer much from the rigors of the season.  But, on the first"
2833,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"morning in December, I found to my grief that the shallow water in the"
2834,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"trough was frozen solid, and--Froggy with it!  I could see him tightly"
2835,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"imprisoned in the clear ice, about midway from the surface.  His limbs"
2836,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"were extended, showing that he had bravely kicked against his hard fate"
2837,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"to the last.  I gave him up, then, and went into the house"
2838,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,disconsolate.  But my mother was still hopeful.  Under her directions I
2839,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"heated the kitchen shovel, and with it thawed out a block of ice some"
2840,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"inches square, with Froggy in the centre.  This I placed on the hearth"
2841,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"before the fire.  You see I did not dare to break the ice, for fear of"
2842,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,breaking with it the frozen limbs of my pet.  I watched the melting of
2843,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"the block with affectionate interest.  It was slow work, but it came to"
2844,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"an end at last, and Froggy was free.  Still, for a time he lay"
2845,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"motionless, and I feared he was dead.  Then, one limb twitched, then"
2846,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"another, and then he was alive all over, and began to hop away from the"
2847,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"fire.  I rejoiced over him with great joy, put him in a tub of water,"
2848,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"with a piece of bark to sail on, and began laying plans for keeping him"
2849,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"in-doors all winter.  But my mother said it was impossible,--that there"
2850,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"was but one way to save the life of my pet, and that was to take him"
2851,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"down to the millstream and fling him in.  There the water was deep, and"
2852,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"the frogs lived under the ice, cosey and comfortable all winter."
2853,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2854,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"""O mamma,"" I said, ""I can't make up my mind to do that.  He would miss"
2855,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"me so, and I don't believe that the other frogs would treat him well."
2856,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"He is n't of their kind, you know."""
2857,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2858,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"""I think it more likely,"" she answered, ""that they will have sense"
2859,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"enough to perceive his superiority, and will treat him"
2860,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"accordingly,--perhaps make a Prince or President of him.  He will come"
2861,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"among them as a distinguished stranger,--a travelled adventurer."""
2862,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2863,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"This consoled and determined me.  I put on my cloak and hood, and set"
2864,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"out at once, for fear I should lose courage.  I ran all the way,"
2865,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"talking to my funny little pet, and saying, I doubt not, many silly"
2866,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"things, but which, I am sure, went no further."
2867,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,
2868,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"When I came to the bank of the stream, I thought perhaps he would hop"
2869,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"in of his own accord.  I bade him farewell, and held him out over the"
2870,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,"water.  But I suppose it looked big and dreary to him, for he did not"
2871,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,stir.  I even fancied that he looked at me reproachfully for thinking
2872,MY PET FROM THE CLOUDS.,that he would be so willing to leave me.  I was obliged to give him a

2925,A TRAGEDY.,
2926,A TRAGEDY.,"The summer that I was eight years old I went to school, at our little"
2927,A TRAGEDY.,"brown country schoolhouse, alone; my elder sister going to a select"
2928,A TRAGEDY.,"school in the village, where she actually studied grammar and wrote"
2929,A TRAGEDY.,"compositions!  Our school-mistress was Miss Grey, quite a pretty young"
2930,A TRAGEDY.,"lady, but folks said not a good teacher.  They said she had ""no"
2931,A TRAGEDY.,"government,"" and certainly we had a very easy time of it.  She was what"
2932,A TRAGEDY.,"is called ""absent-minded,"" and often forgot to hear some of our"
2933,A TRAGEDY.,"lessons, and we thought it would n't be polite to remind her of them."
2934,A TRAGEDY.,"She had a soft and mournful voice, and a droopy sort of a look,"
2935,A TRAGEDY.,"especially about her hair.  She dressed a little queer sometimes, and"
2936,A TRAGEDY.,"played on the accordion, so it was whispered about that she wrote"
2937,A TRAGEDY.,"poetry.  I know she read it a good deal, and novels too.  She had in"
2938,A TRAGEDY.,"her desk a very long romance, called ""The Children of the Abbey,"" which"
2939,A TRAGEDY.,"she used to read at noontime and recess.  She read it through, and then"
2940,A TRAGEDY.,"she appeared to read it backward, for it lasted nearly all summer.  It"
2941,A TRAGEDY.,"seemed to me that the story went on and on, till it came to the last"
2942,A TRAGEDY.,"page of the book, then turned round and went the other way."
2943,A TRAGEDY.,
2944,A TRAGEDY.,"I said I went to school alone; yet after a while I had company, which"
2945,A TRAGEDY.,"no one else would have thought of much account, but which was quite a"
2946,A TRAGEDY.,comfort to me.  One day I made a purchase with my own money.  It was
2947,A TRAGEDY.,"only a little pocket-handkerchief, but such a handkerchief!  On it was"
2948,A TRAGEDY.,"printed, in bright blue, a picture of General George Washington, in"
2949,A TRAGEDY.,"full regimentals, with his sword in his hand, flanked by the Ten"
2950,A TRAGEDY.,"Commandments, and with a scroll labelled ""Constitution"" for his base."
2951,A TRAGEDY.,
2952,A TRAGEDY.,"At first I looked upon that stern face, with its strong, tight mouth,"
2953,A TRAGEDY.,"like a steel-trap just sprung, with a good deal of reverence; but as I"
2954,A TRAGEDY.,"grew familiar with him I became fond of him, and part of the time"
2955,A TRAGEDY.,"treated him as a doll; indeed, he seemed to me more real than any doll"
2956,A TRAGEDY.,"I ever had, and far dearer.  I folded him carefully every morning and"
2957,A TRAGEDY.,"laid him in my dinner-basket, over my rations, grieving that I was"
2958,A TRAGEDY.,"obliged from limited space to fold under his legs, giving them an"
2959,A TRAGEDY.,"amputated look.  But I laid him out at full length in my desk, and"
2960,A TRAGEDY.,"often lifted the cover to take an admiring look at him, during the day."
2961,A TRAGEDY.,"At night, I laid him in one of my dolls' beds, and actually ""tucked in"""
2962,A TRAGEDY.,"the ""Father of his Country,"" calling him ""George, my boy,"" and telling"
2963,A TRAGEDY.,"him to be good, and not to get up in the morning and go to hacking away"
2964,A TRAGEDY.,"at cherry-trees, with that sword of his."
2965,A TRAGEDY.,
2966,A TRAGEDY.,"He was two in one,--George I. and II.  He was little George, or the"
2967,A TRAGEDY.,"great General, just as the occasion demanded.  On the Fourth of July, I"
2968,A TRAGEDY.,"remember, he appeared in all his glory to deliver an oration to ""a"
2969,A TRAGEDY.,"large and appreciative audience"" of dolls and kittens.  He spoke in"
2970,A TRAGEDY.,"this wise: ""Fellow-Citizens, and your wives and daughters, I 'm a"
2971,A TRAGEDY.,"warrior, not an orator.  I only want to say--to say--to tell you that"
2972,A TRAGEDY.,if it had n't been for me you would n't have had any Fourth of July the
2973,A TRAGEDY.,"year round, nor any parades, nor rockets, nor squibs, nor star-spangled"
2974,A TRAGEDY.,"banners, nor pumpkin-pies, nor ginger-pop.  We should all have been"
2975,A TRAGEDY.,"British, or Irish, and worn red coats, and ate blood-puddings, and"
2976,A TRAGEDY.,"drank ale, and hurrahed for King George forevermore.  This is the"
2977,A TRAGEDY.,"truth, fellow-citizens, for I cannot tell a lie,--you know I cannot"
2978,A TRAGEDY.,"tell a lie.  But I don't want to brag over you, and if you will still"
2979,A TRAGEDY.,"be good Yankee Christians, brave and industrious, I will still be the"
2980,A TRAGEDY.,"father of your country, world without end, Amen!  Band, please strike"
2981,A TRAGEDY.,"up 'Hail Columbia!'"""
2982,A TRAGEDY.,
2983,A TRAGEDY.,By the middle of the summer the poor General's face became as badly
2984,A TRAGEDY.,"soiled as ever it was after a long march, over dusty summer roads.  Yet"
2985,A TRAGEDY.,"I declined to have him washed, fearing that, after all, his colors"
2986,A TRAGEDY.,"might not be ""true blue."""
2987,A TRAGEDY.,
2988,A TRAGEDY.,"One Monday morning my mother sent by me a note to Miss Grey, inviting"
2989,A TRAGEDY.,"her to accompany me home that day, and spend a week with us.  With my"
2990,A TRAGEDY.,"head full of thoughts of this invitation, I hurried away to school"
2991,A TRAGEDY.,"earlier than usual, and for the first time left General George behind"
2992,A TRAGEDY.,"me, lying on his bed in my chamber.  I missed him sadly during the day,"
2993,A TRAGEDY.,"but came home in triumph at night, bringing Miss Grey with me.  I took"
2994,A TRAGEDY.,"her at once about the premises, to show her my pets.  I exhibited with"
2995,A TRAGEDY.,"much pride my tame hawk Toby, but she was afraid of him; though I"
2996,A TRAGEDY.,"assured her that he was a hawk of most exemplary character, and"
2997,A TRAGEDY.,civilized to such a degree that he respected the rights of all the
2998,A TRAGEDY.,"mother-hens and ducks, and never asked for spring-chickens, but"
2999,A TRAGEDY.,"contented himself with frogs, like a Frenchman.  Then I took her to the"
3000,A TRAGEDY.,"woodshed, to see my cat, with almost a barrelful of young kittens."
3001,A TRAGEDY.,What a lovely sight it was!  Then I led her to where my speckled hen
3002,A TRAGEDY.,"kept house in a coop, with half a dozen cunning little chicks.  The"
3003,A TRAGEDY.,"hen-mother was frightened as we came near, and called to her little"
3004,A TRAGEDY.,"ones to come in out of danger; but they would n't mind, and she was"
3005,A TRAGEDY.,"very angry, and ruffled up her feathers, and scolded furiously at their"
3006,A TRAGEDY.,"disobedience.  ""I think biddies are very unamiable creatures,"" said"
3007,A TRAGEDY.,"Miss Grey.  I said nothing, but I thought to myself, ""Ah, Miss Grey, if"
3008,A TRAGEDY.,"you were a mother, with ever so many children, playing around the door"
3009,A TRAGEDY.,"so peacefully, and you shut up in jail, for no crime but scratching up"
3010,A TRAGEDY.,"food in gardens for them, and you should love them _dreadfully_, and"
3011,A TRAGEDY.,"should see two giantesses, a big giantess and a middling-sized"
3012,A TRAGEDY.,"giantess, come tramping right in among them, and you not able to help"
3013,A TRAGEDY.,"them only by ruffling up your feathers and scolding, you 'd be a little"
3014,A TRAGEDY.,"unamiable too, perhaps, for I've heard my mother say that hen nature"
3015,A TRAGEDY.,"was a good deal like human nature.""  Then I showed her our gray goose's"
3016,A TRAGEDY.,"nest, with an egg in it.  But when I expected her to be astonished, she"
3017,A TRAGEDY.,"only said, ""Why, I thought the egg of the fowl that saved Rome was much"
3018,A TRAGEDY.,"larger than this.""  Now this goose laid the largest eggs of any goose"
3019,A TRAGEDY.,"in the neighborhood.  ""Did you expect it to be as big as the _roc's_"
3020,A TRAGEDY.,"egg in 'Sinbad the Sailor'?"" I asked."
3021,A TRAGEDY.,
3022,A TRAGEDY.,"As we were passing through the yard, going to the stable, to see my"
3023,A TRAGEDY.,"brother's little colt, we encountered the week's washing, hanging on"
3024,A TRAGEDY.,"the line, and right before my eyes swung my handkerchief, with the"
3025,A TRAGEDY.,"beloved portrait almost washed out!  Indeed, scarce a ghost of the"
3026,A TRAGEDY.,great and worthy George remained.  I caught it off and burst into
3027,A TRAGEDY.,"tears, crying, ""O, it's all faded out,--it's all faded out!"""
3028,A TRAGEDY.,
3029,A TRAGEDY.,"""Why, you silly child,"" said Miss Grey, ""don't cry so for a little"
3030,A TRAGEDY.,"scrap of a handkerchief like that."""
3031,A TRAGEDY.,
3032,A TRAGEDY.,"""It ain't only a handkerchief,"" I sobbed, ""it's General Washington and"
3033,A TRAGEDY.,"my boy George both together.  I 've seen you cry, Miss Grey, over the"
3034,A TRAGEDY.,"'Children of the Abbey,' and mother says they never lived; but General"
3035,A TRAGEDY.,"Washington did live, and was the Father of his Country; and then there"
3036,A TRAGEDY.,"were all the Ten Commandments, too.  I declare Nancy is as bad as Moses"
3037,A TRAGEDY.,"was, when he smashed the tables of stone."""
3038,A TRAGEDY.,
3039,A TRAGEDY.,"But Miss Grey only laughed at my sorrow, and went into the house.  When"
3040,A TRAGEDY.,"I followed her, I whispered to mother, ""Have we got the 'Children of"
3041,A TRAGEDY.,"the Abbey'?  If we have, please give it to Miss Grey to amuse herself"
3042,A TRAGEDY.,"with."""
3043,A TRAGEDY.,
3044,A TRAGEDY.,"Then I went up stairs and laid out my dead George, and had my foolish"
3045,A TRAGEDY.,"little cry out.  After all, my great General had faded and wilted away"
3046,A TRAGEDY.,into an unsightly little rag of a handkerchief.  What a fall was there!
3047,A TRAGEDY.,We have seen some very like it in these days.
3048,A TRAGEDY.,
3049,A TRAGEDY.,"I had no heart to keep him by me any longer, so I gave him to my little"
3050,A TRAGEDY.,"brother, who put him to every possible use except that of a"
3051,A TRAGEDY.,handkerchief.  That was a hard campaign for the feeble old General.
3052,A TRAGEDY.,Sometimes he did service as the sail for a boat; sometimes green
3053,A TRAGEDY.,"apples, or rabbit feed, or worms for bait were tied up in him.  His"
3054,A TRAGEDY.,"feet, with what was left of the Constitution, were torn off and rammed"
3055,A TRAGEDY.,"into a small cannon's mouth for wadding; and, finally, he went up on"
3056,A TRAGEDY.,"the tail of a kite.  In mid-air he became detached, and dropped into a"
3057,A TRAGEDY.,"tall thorn-tree.  Here he got stuck fast, and so remained till he"
3058,A TRAGEDY.,fluttered himself to pieces bit by bit.

3087,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"oftener called ""little woman,"" for her womanly qualities, and her"

3090,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Early in the war against the Rebellion, Bertha's father and three"
3091,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"brothers enlisted in one regiment, and were very soon marched away to"
3092,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"the front, taking with them the tender, tearful blessings of the lonely"
3093,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"little household left behind.  The good wife and mother, Ernestine"
3094,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Johansen, took upon her brave heart and strong hands the entire"
3095,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"business of the little farm, having for a while only the assistance of"
3096,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"a young adopted son, an orphan nephew, who had lived with the Johansens"
3097,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,from his infancy.  But after having seen his uncle and cousins go forth
3098,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"so bravely to their grand though dreadful duty, the lad Heinrich grew"
3099,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,discontented and unhappy.  He had a man's heart in his boyish
3100,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"breast,--a heart full of patriotic ardor and devotion; and at last his"
3101,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"good aunt consented that he too should go to the war, in the only"
3102,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"capacity in which he could be accepted, as a drummer boy, in a regiment"

3104,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3105,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Bertha had grieved deeply, though quietly, in the brave, uncomplaining,"
3106,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"submissive spirit peculiar to her, at bidding adieu to her dear"
3107,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"father,--to Gustave, and Fritz, and Carl, her brothers,--but she"
3108,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,grieved no less at parting with Heinrich Holberg.  The two children had
3109,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,always been to each other the best and dearest of friends.  Almost from
3110,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"her babyhood, Heinrich had called Bertha his ""little wife,"" and she had"
3111,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"early learned to play the character, in the most demure and charming"
3112,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,manner.  She had for him a tender and clinging affection; she believed
3113,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"in him with all her heart, and he was not altogether unworthy of such"

3116,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Well, Heinrich marched away with the rest of the admirable German band,"
3117,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"proudly and gayly they said,--the pluckiest of drummer-boys.  But he"
3118,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"had seemed neither proud nor gay, a few hours before, when he had run"
3119,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"down to the little lakeside farm, to take leave of his aunt and cousin."
3120,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,He had looked pale and very sad.  He had said farewell in a voice
3121,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"choked with sobs, and when he ran down the little garden walk to the"
3122,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"road, great tears were dropping fast on the bright buttons of his new"
3123,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"uniform.  His ""little wife"" went to her little chamber, knelt down"
3124,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"beside her little bed, and said a little prayer for him,--then dashed"
3125,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"the bitter dew from her sweet violet eyes, and went about her household"

3128,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Alas, it was the same old sad story!  The father was killed at"

3131,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"after a year's hard marching and fighting, a pale, wan invalid, with"
3132,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,one sleeve of his worn blue coat hanging empty.  The third brother is
3133,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"now an officer in the triumphant Union army, and let us thank God for"

3139,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"night attack on his regiment in Tennessee, and carried off by one of"
3140,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"the robber bands of the barbarous Forrest.  His tender age, and gentle,"
3141,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"prepossessing ways, won him no pity.  He was shut up, with thousands of"
3142,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"others, in one of those horrible slaughter-pens of the South, called a"
3143,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"""stockade,"" where he languished for many months, bearing all his"

3148,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Heinrich had been religiously brought up, and while many brave men"
3149,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"about him lost all faith and hope, and believed themselves forgotten by"

3152,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"the vast field of fraternal strife brooded an infinite fatherly love,"
3153,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"and ""the peace of God that passeth all understanding."" He had never a"

3155,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"""many mansions"" of the Father would be all open to those martyrs of"
3156,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"freedom,--that there rest and sweet refreshment awaited them,--that"
3157,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"there pitiless hate and cruel wounds, hunger and fierce heat and bitter"
3158,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"cold, would torture them no more forever."
3159,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3160,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"From the time of his capture, nothing more was heard of poor Heinrich"
3161,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"in his sad home on the Lake shore, and he was at last given up as dead"

3163,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"said, that he was living still, and would come back one day, if only"
3164,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"she could keep up heart for him.  He might be so weak and ill, she"
3165,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"thought, that he would die if she once should give him up,--but not"
3166,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"till then.  O little woman, great was thy faith!  Bertha knew not that"

3170,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3171,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,She had little time for fretting about her absent friend.  Her mother's
3172,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"brave spirit had bent under the successive burdens of sorrow, and her"

3174,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"much difficulty in managing the affairs of the farm, and nearly all the"

3177,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"all went well in that humble and peaceful home, till the bitterest"
3178,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"trouble was past, and the good mother rallied and was able to take part"
3179,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"of the burden of labor and care, which, however cheerfully borne, was"
3180,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,quite too heavy for such young shoulders.
3181,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3182,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,Bertha's wise little head was perplexed.  There was to be a great
3183,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Sanitary fair in the city near by, and she felt a passionate desire to"
3184,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,contribute something towards the great and good work.  What could she
3185,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,do?  She was not rich enough to give money; she could not paint nor
3186,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,embroider; she had not the skill to manufacture elegant trifles; she
3187,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,was not old or pretty or fashionable enough to stand behind one of the
3188,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,tables.  What could she do?
3189,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3190,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,At last it occurred to her that she could contribute to the refreshment
3191,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"department a roll of butter of her own churning, from the milk of her"
3192,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"own little snow-white cow.  So, with her good mother's consent, she"
3193,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"saved all the cream off the rich milk of her pet for a week, and"
3194,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"dedicated the golden product to the soldiers.  She had two churnings,"
3195,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,and the result was five pounds of delicious butter.  Her pleasant work
3196,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"was done in the open air, before the side-door of the cottage, in sight"
3197,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"of the beautiful lake.  On the day of her second churning, her thoughts"
3198,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"were peculiarly sweet and cheerful.  She sung as gayly as the robin,"
3199,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,nestling in the vine-leaves over the cottage window.  Her soul was as
3200,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"serene as the sky, her heart as tranquil as the lake, sleeping in the"
3201,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,still sunshine.
3202,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3203,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"As Bertha worked with all the strength of her vigorous little arms, and"
3204,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"with a gay good-will, little jets of cream now and then spirted up"
3205,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"around the dasher, sometimes sprinkling her round, rosy face, and once"
3206,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,or twice reaching her smiling lips to dissolve in sweetness there; and
3207,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"she said to herself, ""How many sweet and beautiful things have gone to"
3208,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,make up this golden cream!--the tender bloom of the early summer clover
3209,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"and daisies, and dew and sunshine, and by and by, when it hardens into"
3210,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"more golden butter, and goes to the 'Sanitary,' won't more beautiful"
3211,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"things still be added to it?--pity, and love, and patriotism, and the"
3212,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"blessing of God?""  Then her thoughts wandered, and her face clouded,"
3213,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"and she murmured, ""O our poor sick and wounded soldiers!  O the poor"
3214,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"prisoners!  O my poor, dear Heinrich!"""
3215,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3216,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Just then she heard her mother call her in an eager, trembling voice."
3217,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"She ran into the cottage to see, seated in the neat kitchen, a young"
3218,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"soldier, in a faded and tattered uniform,--a pale, emaciated figure,"
3219,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"childlike in weakness, but old in suffering."
3220,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3221,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Bertha knew him rather by heart than by sight, and, falling on his"
3222,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"neck, cried, ""Dear, dear Heinrich!  I have always said the Lord would"
3223,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"bring you back, and He has, has n't he?"""
3224,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3225,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"""Yes, little wife, all that the Rebels have left of me."""
3226,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3227,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,The drummer-boy's story was sad and strange but such stories are
3228,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,painfully common now-a-days.  He had escaped from the stockade with a
3229,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,party of friends; they had been chased by bloodhounds and all retaken.
3230,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Heinrich escaped again, alone; he was befriended, fed, guided by loyal"
3231,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"negroes; he made his way, on foot, through the mountains of Tennessee,"
3232,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"and, after countless hardships and adventures, reached the glorious"
3233,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Northwest, and his home.  He was ill with a disease brought on by"
3234,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"starvation and exposure, and though he had no battle-wounds to show,"
3235,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"there were, on his neck and arms, the terrible marks of the"
3236,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"bloodhound's teeth,--surely honorable scars.  On the whole, Bertha"
3237,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Johansen thought her cousin Heinrich a hero, and I think she was right."
3238,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3239,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"But to return to the Sanitary butter,--""the little widow's mite."""
3240,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Bertha made it up into beautiful rolls, which she printed with a stamp"
3241,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"representing buttercups and clover-flowers, and it looked deliciously"
3242,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"tempting.  ""There is only five pounds,"" she said, as she walked towards"
3243,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"the Fair Grounds, bearing her offering in a neat basket, covered with a"
3244,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"snowy napkin.  ""Only five pounds; how I wish there were fifty.  If our"
3245,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"dear Lord were only here on earth, He could easily make them fifty.  If"
3246,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"He could multiply loaves of bread, I suppose He could rolls of butter."
3247,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"But, O dear, He _is n't_ here!"""
3248,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3249,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Dear Bertha, our Lord is always on earth, in the hearts of good men and"
3250,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"women,--is always ready to work through them His miracles of love and"
3251,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,mercy.
3252,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3253,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,Bertha presented her humble gift most modestly to one of the lady
3254,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"managers, who received it very graciously.  This lady was one of"
3255,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Bertha's neighbors, and knew of her beautiful life of duty, obedience,"
3256,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,and cheerful self-sacrifices.
3257,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3258,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"She told the simple story of the child to some friends about her, and"
3259,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,showed the five rolls of golden butter.  A group of gentlemen soon
3260,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"gathered near.  ""I will give a dollar a pound for that butter,"" said"
3261,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"one.  ""I will give two,"" called out another.  Then there was a laugh."
3262,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Then other bids were made,--three, four, five dollars.  It was getting"
3263,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"to be a nice little frolic, and those grave business men entered into"
3264,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"it like boys.  Higher and higher they went, till at last Bertha's"
3265,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"butter was knocked down at fifty dollars,--ten dollars a pound."
3266,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,
3267,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"As the purchaser laid down a roll of ""greenbacks"" for the golden rolls"
3268,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"of butter, a gust of wind caught the bills and blew them over the"
3269,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"counter, where the lady secured them.  ""So riches fly away in your"
3270,THE LITTLE WIDOW'S MITE.,"Sanitary Fairs,"" said the gentleman, smiling.  ""Yes,"" replied the lady,"

3332,CHAPTER I.,
3333,CHAPTER I.,"Bessie Raeburn was a very nice little girl indeed, truthful, trustful,"
3334,CHAPTER I.,"generous, and affectionate.  But she was by no means without some spicy"
3335,CHAPTER I.,"little faults of her own.  She was impulsive to rashness, and decidedly"
3336,CHAPTER I.,self-willed.  She was given to odd little romantic fancies and secret
3337,CHAPTER I.,"schemes, which sometimes got her into trouble, when she attempted to"
3338,CHAPTER I.,"carry them out.  She was an only child, and much petted and indulged in"
3339,CHAPTER I.,"a happy and luxurious home, having everything which a reasonable little"
3340,CHAPTER I.,lady in short frocks and long curls could ask for.  Yet she was not
3341,CHAPTER I.,contented; having a foolish ambition to distinguish herself by doing
3342,CHAPTER I.,"something quite out of the ordinary line of little girls,--something"
3343,CHAPTER I.,"that would make people stare, and say ""wonderful!"" ""surprising!"" ""a"
3344,CHAPTER I.,"most extraordinary child!""  She liked to say ""I dare!"" and ""I 'm not"
3345,CHAPTER I.,"afraid!""  ""I don't _fear_ anything there is,"" she would say, ""not even"
3346,CHAPTER I.,"lions, or spiders, or bears, or bumblebees,--but I don't like them near"
3347,CHAPTER I.,"me; they are disagreeable."""
3348,CHAPTER I.,
3349,CHAPTER I.,"She learned to read when very young, and took most eagerly to books of"
3350,CHAPTER I.,travel and adventure.  She passionately longed for adventures of her
3351,CHAPTER I.,"own, and often planned out exploits of a most perilous and surprising"
3352,CHAPTER I.,character.
3353,CHAPTER I.,
3354,CHAPTER I.,"One Christmas-eve, when Bessie was between seven and eight years of"
3355,CHAPTER I.,"age, a wild little scheme came into her head, as she sat curled up on a"
3356,CHAPTER I.,"sofa in the library, listening to her father, while he read to her"

3380,CHAPTER I.,"though he only belonged to the rich people.  And yet, mamma, he was"
3381,CHAPTER I.,"dreadful poor, and spent the first day of his life in a manger, with"
3382,CHAPTER I.,"cows and things; though, to be sure, he had beautiful presents, those"

3393,CHAPTER I.,"Bessie kissed him again, and called him ""a dear, handsome old darling,"""
3394,CHAPTER I.,"and then, with another last coquettish kiss through the balusters, she"
3395,CHAPTER I.,"bounded laughingly past her mamma, up the stairs, into her little room"
3396,CHAPTER I.,"and behind the door, from which point of vantage she emerged with a"
3397,CHAPTER I.,"terrific ""boo!"" intended to startle her mamma out of her senses,--but I"

3399,CHAPTER I.,
3400,CHAPTER I.,"Mrs. Raeburn, having heard her daughter repeat her simple prayer,"

3402,CHAPTER I.,"seen her nicely in bed, and put everything in order for the morning,"
3403,CHAPTER I.,left her quite alone.  And then the wonderful scheme that had flashed
3404,CHAPTER I.,"into her brain down stairs was thought over and resolutely arranged,"
3405,CHAPTER I.,"and a famous little plot of mischievous benevolence it was, as you"
3406,CHAPTER I.,shall see.
3407,CHAPTER I.,
3408,CHAPTER I.,Amid all the joyful excitement and merry confusion of Christmas
3409,CHAPTER I.,"morning, Bessie found time to think over her plan; and she would set"
3410,CHAPTER I.,her red lips very firmly whenever she felt her courage giving way the
3411,CHAPTER I.,"least in the world.  She _would_ be a heroine for once,--would have a"
3412,CHAPTER I.,"real adventure of her own to relate to a wondering and admiring circle,"
3413,CHAPTER I.,that very Christmas night.
3414,CHAPTER I.,
3415,CHAPTER I.,While mamma and servants were occupied in preparations for a large
3416,CHAPTER I.,"dinner-party, Bessie found opportunities for packing a little basket"
3417,CHAPTER I.,"with tiny tarts, apples, nuts, and candies; then she put on her pretty"
3418,CHAPTER I.,"winter coat, trimmed with fur, and her new velvet hat, with a long"
3419,CHAPTER I.,"scarlet plume, the pride of her heart, and her warm tippet and soft"
3420,CHAPTER I.,gloves and high Balmoral boots.  Then she took from her drawer a dainty
3421,CHAPTER I.,"_porte-monnaie_, well filled with bright new pennies and small silver"
3422,CHAPTER I.,"coin, and containing a little compartment lined with crimson satin,"
3423,CHAPTER I.,"wherein two gold dollars dwelt together in state, like a Mongolian king"
3424,CHAPTER I.,"and queen.  Then taking her basket on her arm, and thrusting her hands"
3425,CHAPTER I.,"into her little muff, she stole down stairs on tiptoe, and made her"
3426,CHAPTER I.,"escape from the house, unperceived by any one."
3427,CHAPTER I.,
3428,CHAPTER I.,Mr. Raeburn lived in the aristocratic part of the city of New York; and
3429,CHAPTER I.,"Bessie, thinking that she could not there carry out her plan in a"
3430,CHAPTER I.,"perfectly satisfactory manner, hailed a down-town stage.  Driver and"
3431,CHAPTER I.,passengers looked surprised to see a child taking a trip all alone; but
3432,CHAPTER I.,"Bessie had such an old, authoritative manner, that they supposed that"
3433,CHAPTER I.,"all was right.  After a long, long ride, she alighted somewhere in the"
3434,CHAPTER I.,neighborhood of the poorest and least respectable part of the city.  I
3435,CHAPTER I.,"may as well tell you now, if you have n't guessed it, Bessie was bound"
3436,CHAPTER I.,"on a mission, a charitable visit to the poor,--the miserably poor, of"
3437,CHAPTER I.,whom she had heard her father read.  She anxiously looked around her
3438,CHAPTER I.,"for a beggar-child, who should act as her guide to some home of"
3439,CHAPTER I.,"unmerited misfortune, where virtuous poverty pined, and wept, and"
3440,CHAPTER I.,waited.  Alas! there were plenty of sad little mendicants on the
3441,CHAPTER I.,"streets that day, but Bessie was not easily satisfied.  ""It must be a"
3442,CHAPTER I.,"little girl,"" she said to herself, ""very, very poor,--pale, and thin,"
3443,CHAPTER I.,"and ragged, and sorrowful, but still pretty, and mild-looking.  And she"
3444,CHAPTER I.,"must have a pretty name too, like the little girls that beg in magazine"
3445,CHAPTER I.,"stories, or sell matches, and are stolen by gypsies, and sing ballads"
3446,CHAPTER I.,"for dreadful organ-grinders, and all that.""  It was a long time before"
3447,CHAPTER I.,"she found one at all to her mind, but finally she was accosted by a"
3448,CHAPTER I.,"little girl, who looked wretched enough, to be sure,--tattered, and"
3449,CHAPTER I.,"sickly, and starved.  She was not quite up to the mark as to"
3450,CHAPTER I.,"prettiness, though she had soft, sorrowful eyes and a delicate mouth."
3451,CHAPTER I.,"Hunger, cold, and ill-treatment are not very favorable to beauty.  Then"
3452,CHAPTER I.,"the name she gave was decidedly unromantic,--_Molly Magee_.  But the"
3453,CHAPTER I.,"poor child told a piteous story, which soon brought tears to Bessie's"
3454,CHAPTER I.,"gentle eyes,--how her father was dead of fever, and her mother a"
3455,CHAPTER I.,"suffering invalid; how she was obliged to beg in the streets, from"
3456,CHAPTER I.,"morning till night, to obtain food for that poor dear mother, three"
3457,CHAPTER I.,"darling little brothers, and two sisters, twins and _blind_!  It was a"
3458,CHAPTER I.,"hard case, surely, and Bessie offered at once to go home with her"
3459,CHAPTER I.,"petitioner, to see what she could do towards alleviating the family"
3460,CHAPTER I.,"distress.  The little mendicant hesitated at first, and attempted to"
3461,CHAPTER I.,"dissuade her, but at last, as Bessie obstinately insisted on her own"
3462,CHAPTER I.,"plan of benevolence, she yielded, and rather sullenly led the way"
3463,CHAPTER I.,"homeward.  Ah, what a way it was! down one dirty street and up"
3464,CHAPTER I.,"another,--through vile courts and alleys reeking with filth, swarming"
3465,CHAPTER I.,"with idle, loud-voiced men, wretched-looking women, slatternly girls,"
3466,CHAPTER I.,and forlorn children.  Bessie's heart grew sick and her courage failed
3467,CHAPTER I.,"her.  If she had known the way back, she would gladly have made an"
3468,CHAPTER I.,inglorious retreat!
3469,CHAPTER I.,
3470,CHAPTER I.,"The guide at last conducted her down a flight of slippery steps,"
3471,CHAPTER I.,"leading to the basement of a squalid old tenement-house, in the five"
3472,CHAPTER I.,"stories of which more than as many families were packed, layer on"
3473,CHAPTER I.,"layer, and Bessie found herself in the very bosom of the distressed"
3474,CHAPTER I.,family of her humble little friend.  This home of virtuous poverty was
3475,CHAPTER I.,"not exactly what she looked for.  It was darker, dirtier, more confused"
3476,CHAPTER I.,"and noisy; it smelt worse.  There were the ""three darling little"
3477,CHAPTER I.,"brothers,"" to be sure, and they were quite satisfactorily ragged.  But"
3478,CHAPTER I.,"Bessie looked in vain for the twin-sisters, whose blindness had so"
3479,CHAPTER I.,"engaged her sympathies.  But she said to herself, ""Perhaps they, too,"
3480,CHAPTER I.,"have gone out begging, with a pair of twin dogs to lead them.""  The"
3481,CHAPTER I.,"invalid mother was surely on the mend, for she looked quite stout, and"
3482,CHAPTER I.,"her face was flushed, though that might be from fever.  She sat by an"
3483,CHAPTER I.,"old stove, smoking a short black pipe."
3484,CHAPTER I.,
3485,CHAPTER I.,[Illustration: Bessie]
3486,CHAPTER I.,
3487,CHAPTER I.,"""Well, Molly, what have you brought us?"" exclaimed this interesting"

3490,CHAPTER I.,"""_I_ have n't got anything,"" was the reply; ""but here's a rich little"

3849,CHAPTER II.,"daily papers, stating that they had taken in a little street wanderer,"
3850,CHAPTER II.,"who had evidently been born in a happier and higher condition, and"
3851,CHAPTER II.,"begging any parents who may have had a little girl stolen from them,"
3852,CHAPTER II.,"eight or nine years before, to call, with the hope of identifying her."
3853,CHAPTER II.,"But weeks, months went by, and no answer came, and Molly was not"
3854,CHAPTER II.,"claimed, except by a hideous old German organ-grinder, who could n't"
3855,CHAPTER II.,"prove property, so could n't take her away,--but took herself off,"
3856,CHAPTER II.,scolding in very low Dutch.
3857,CHAPTER II.,
3858,CHAPTER II.,"That advertisement met many thousands of careless eyes, but not the"
3859,CHAPTER II.,"sad, yearning eyes to which it would have come like the message of"
3860,CHAPTER II.,"angels,--""Glad tidings of great joy.""  Those eyes were then gazing on"
3861,CHAPTER II.,"strange tropical scenes, on orange-groves and jessamine bowers, and on"
3862,CHAPTER II.,the purple sea that washes the lovely shores of Florida.
3863,CHAPTER II.,
3864,CHAPTER II.,"All hope of finding Molly's _dream_-home being abandoned, her good"
3865,CHAPTER II.,"friends set about finding a _real_ home for her.  At last, through the"
3866,CHAPTER II.,"Reverend C---- B----, the Chief Shepherd of the Lord's lost lambs in"
3867,CHAPTER II.,"the great wicked city, they succeeded.  A farmer and his wife, good,"
3868,CHAPTER II.,"kindly, intelligent people, living pleasantly and comfortably near a"
3869,CHAPTER II.,"village among the hills of Berkshire, Massachusetts, offered to take"
3870,CHAPTER II.,"her to their home and hearts,--to adopt her as their own, for they were"
3871,CHAPTER II.,childless.
3872,CHAPTER II.,
3873,CHAPTER II.,"Bessie was grieved at the prospect of being parted from her friend,"
3874,CHAPTER II.,"whom she really loved, but was comforted by the promise of an annual"
3875,CHAPTER II.,"visit to her, in Berkshire."
3876,CHAPTER II.,
3877,CHAPTER II.,Poor little Molly wept much when she left her good friends.  They had
3878,CHAPTER II.,"not only taught her what human kindness and affection were, but had"
3879,CHAPTER II.,"taught her much about her Heavenly Father,--had led her straight to the"
3880,CHAPTER II.,"arms of His infinite love.  So her tears were not all of sadness, but"
3881,CHAPTER II.,"of tenderest gratitude, as she went from their door with kindly Farmer"
3882,CHAPTER II.,Morton.
3883,CHAPTER II.,
3884,CHAPTER II.,
3885,CHAPTER III.,CHAPTER III.
3886,CHAPTER III.,
3887,CHAPTER III.,"Our little friend Molly spent five peaceful, happy years in her home"
3888,CHAPTER III.,"among the grand old hills of Berkshire, with Farmer Morton and his"
3889,CHAPTER III.,"kind, good wife.  She was treated in every respect as a daughter, well"
3890,CHAPTER III.,"instructed in religious duties and moral obligations, and in all useful"
3891,CHAPTER III.,housewifely arts.  Nor was school education withheld.  As soon as she
3892,CHAPTER III.,"had acquired the first rudiments of knowledge, she was sent to the"
3893,CHAPTER III.,"excellent village academy, where she proved an apt and diligent"
3894,CHAPTER III.,"scholar.  In return for all this generous, fostering care, Molly (or"
3895,CHAPTER III.,_Mary Morton_ as she was usually called) gave to the kind pair who had
3896,CHAPTER III.,"so generously adopted her, all the affection, respect, and obedience"
3897,CHAPTER III.,due to parents; added to a gratitude inexpressibly deep and tender.
3898,CHAPTER III.,"Her life as a beggar-girl, half fed, half clad, and always abused, had"
3899,CHAPTER III.,been so terribly sad that she could never forget it; and her present
3900,CHAPTER III.,life seemed one of heavenly serenity and security in contrast.
3901,CHAPTER III.,
3902,CHAPTER III.,"She did not see her ""_dream_-father and mother"" as often as formerly."
3903,CHAPTER III.,"She did not need them.  But when they did come to her in her slumbers,"
3904,CHAPTER III.,"they looked happy, and smiled over her."
3905,CHAPTER III.,
3906,CHAPTER III.,"Molly was now in her fifteenth summer,--a tall, graceful girl, with a"
3907,CHAPTER III.,"sweet, delicate face.  She was still pale and slender, for she had not"
3908,CHAPTER III.,"quite outgrown the effects of the old sorrow, starvation, and exposure."
3909,CHAPTER III.,"Her face often wore an expression of pensive sadness, unsuited to her"
3910,CHAPTER III.,"years,--a faint shadow of her unhappy childhood still lingering about"
3911,CHAPTER III.,"her,--but it was always ready to brighten into cheerful smiles at a"
3912,CHAPTER III.,kind word or look.
3913,CHAPTER III.,
3914,CHAPTER III.,"Molly had made more than one visit to her friends in New York, and now"
3915,CHAPTER III.,the Raeburns were spending some weeks in the pretty village which was
3916,CHAPTER III.,scarcely a mile from the farm-house of Mr. Morton.  They were as kind
3917,CHAPTER III.,"as ever to Molly, and quite proud of her.  They took her with them on"
3918,CHAPTER III.,"all their drives among the hills, or rows upon the lakes.  Bessie"
3919,CHAPTER III.,"always spoke of her friend as ""My Molly,"" seeming to think she had in"
3920,CHAPTER III.,"her ""certain inalienable rights,"" chief of which was the right of"
3921,CHAPTER III.,discovery.  Molly never thought of disputing those rights.  She looked
3922,CHAPTER III.,"up to pretty, wayward, impulsive Bessie Raeburn as to a superior"
3923,CHAPTER III.,"being,--an angelic deliverer.  In her half-adoring gratitude and love,"
3924,CHAPTER III.,"she could have ""kissed the hem of her garment,"" or the lower flounce of"
3925,CHAPTER III.,"her pretty organdie dress.  She would often say, ""O, where would I have"
3926,CHAPTER III.,"been now, if it had not been for _you_, dear Bessie?  In a pauper's"
3927,CHAPTER III.,"grave,--or worse, in prison,--or worse still, on the streets, a wicked,"
3928,CHAPTER III.,"lost girl, loving nobody, and only knowing of God and Jesus by hearing"
3929,CHAPTER III.,"their names in dreadful oaths."""
3930,CHAPTER III.,
3931,CHAPTER III.,"""But, Molly dear,"" replied Bessie,--""I _must_ always call you Molly,--I"
3932,CHAPTER III.,"have done so little, after all.  In thanking me, don't forget papa and"
3933,CHAPTER III.,"your father Morton."""
3934,CHAPTER III.,
3935,CHAPTER III.,"""I don't forget them, nor my Father in heaven either; but you, Bessie,"
3936,CHAPTER III.,"were the first to pity me and try to help me, though I had done you"
3937,CHAPTER III.,"wrong."""
3938,CHAPTER III.,
3939,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, as for that, Molly,"" said Bessie, seriously, ""perhaps God had"
3940,CHAPTER III.,more to do with that wild Christmas expedition of mine than anybody
3941,CHAPTER III.,thought at the time.  It seemed so rash and foolish.  I have always
3942,CHAPTER III.,"thought that good policeman an angel, an Irish angel, in the rough,"
3943,CHAPTER III.,though he did not know it.  I don't believe that angels and saints ever
3944,CHAPTER III.,"have a very high opinion of themselves, do you?"""
3945,CHAPTER III.,
3946,CHAPTER III.,"This was the happiest summer of Molly's life,--it was also to prove the"
3947,CHAPTER III.,most memorable.
3948,CHAPTER III.,
3949,CHAPTER III.,"One afternoon, as she was returning from the village, down a quiet,"
3950,CHAPTER III.,"shady lane, which led through her father's farm, she was suddenly"
3951,CHAPTER III.,"confronted by the tyrant of her unhappy childhood, Patrick Magee.  He"
3952,CHAPTER III.,"was even a more wretched looking creature than of old,--shabbier,"
3953,CHAPTER III.,"dirtier, with every mark of the most degrading vice.  As he stepped"
3954,CHAPTER III.,"from behind a hazel-bush, where he had been skulking, into her path,"
3955,CHAPTER III.,"Molly gave an involuntary shriek, and shrank back from him in fear and"
3956,CHAPTER III.,aversion.
3957,CHAPTER III.,
3958,CHAPTER III.,"""Whist, darling!"" he exclaimed in a wheedling tone.  ""Be aisy, just;"
3959,CHAPTER III.,it's not meself that will harm a hair of yer head.  And sure this is
3960,CHAPTER III.,not the way you should meet yer poor ould unfortunate father.  Is this
3961,CHAPTER III.,"the kind of filial piety you 've larned from your grand friends?"""
3962,CHAPTER III.,
3963,CHAPTER III.,"""I do not believe you _are_ my father,"" replied Molly, looking directly"
3964,CHAPTER III.,"into his bleared eyes, that quailed under her gaze."
3965,CHAPTER III.,
3966,CHAPTER III.,"""Now, now, whoever heard the likes o' that?"" began Patrick, with a"
3967,CHAPTER III.,"shocked expression.  ""Denies her own father, that tiled and spint for"
3968,CHAPTER III.,"her!  Why, Molly dear, you are the image of me, barring the color of"
3969,CHAPTER III.,"the hair, mine being a trifle foxy, while yourn is a darkish brown; and"
3970,CHAPTER III.,"barring the lines of care and trouble on my brow,--the hard lines I 've"
3971,CHAPTER III.,"had no child's hand to smooth away, the saints pity me!"""
3972,CHAPTER III.,
3973,CHAPTER III.,"Hero Molly's soft heart was touched, and she asked, gently, ""Where do"
3974,CHAPTER III.,"you come from now? and what do you want of me?"""
3975,CHAPTER III.,
3976,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, I came last from New York, when, after a power of trouble, I"
3977,CHAPTER III.,found out your whereabouts.  My heart so cried out for my daughter and
3978,CHAPTER III.,"my darling boys.  You see, for the five years past I 've been, so to"
3979,CHAPTER III.,"speak, in retirement on the Hudson."""
3980,CHAPTER III.,
3981,CHAPTER III.,"""Where?"" asked Molly, bewildered."
3982,CHAPTER III.,
3983,CHAPTER III.,"""Why, in a quiet town called Sing Sing; but; faith! it's little singing"
3984,CHAPTER III.,"I did there."""
3985,CHAPTER III.,
3986,CHAPTER III.,"""Do you mean that you have been in the penitentiary?"" said Molly,"
3987,CHAPTER III.,startled.
3988,CHAPTER III.,
3989,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, not to put too fine a point on it, yes.  But you see it's a hard"
3990,CHAPTER III.,"word to pronounce, that same.  I got into what gintlemen call"
3991,CHAPTER III.,"'difficulties,' pretty soon after my Biddy died, and my poor children"
3992,CHAPTER III.,"was torn from my arms.  Somehow, I had no heart to keep up a good"
3993,CHAPTER III.,character.  I was what they call _desperate_; so I went into a
3994,CHAPTER III.,"gintleman's house one avening, without ringing the bell and sending up"
3995,CHAPTER III.,"my card, as in my better days I should have done, you know.  I went in"
3996,CHAPTER III.,"head foremost, through a back window, and when I was coming out with a"
3997,CHAPTER III.,"trifle of silver, the police nabbed me, and it was all up for a while"
3998,CHAPTER III.,with poor Pat Magee.  Now what do I want with you?  I want to know
3999,CHAPTER III.,"about my darling boys, of course.  Are they living and respectable?"""
4000,CHAPTER III.,
4001,CHAPTER III.,"""Yes,"" replied Molly; ""they are well and doing well.  I hear from them"
4002,CHAPTER III.,"twice a year, and write to them oftener."""
4003,CHAPTER III.,
4004,CHAPTER III.,"""Doing well, are they! but doing nothing for their poor ould father."
4005,CHAPTER III.,"Ah, this is a hard world."""
4006,CHAPTER III.,
4007,CHAPTER III.,"Molly could not refrain from saying, ""They _used_ to think it so, but"
4008,CHAPTER III.,"they don't now.  They have good friends, comfortable homes, and are"
4009,CHAPTER III.,"happy and industrious."""
4010,CHAPTER III.,
4011,CHAPTER III.,"""_Industrious!_ and isn't it myself that taught them to be that same?"
4012,CHAPTER III.,Niver did I spare the rod when they came home empty-handed from a day
4013,CHAPTER III.,"on the streets."""
4014,CHAPTER III.,
4015,CHAPTER III.,"Molly made no reply, but tried to pass on.  Again Patrick stopped her,"
4016,CHAPTER III.,"and said, with a strange, cunning smile, ""And so, miss, you don't"
4017,CHAPTER III.,"believe I 'm your rale father."""
4018,CHAPTER III.,
4019,CHAPTER III.,"""No,"" answered Molly, firmly.  ""I have always had indistinct"
4020,CHAPTER III.,recollections of a very different home from that wretched cellar in the
4021,CHAPTER III.,"Five Points, and of other parents than you and Mrs. Magee.  _I believe"
4022,CHAPTER III.,"you stole me when I was very young._"""
4023,CHAPTER III.,
4024,CHAPTER III.,"""No, indade.  I had nothing to do with it,"" replied Patrick, hastily."
4025,CHAPTER III.,
4026,CHAPTER III.,"""Then your wife did it?"""
4027,CHAPTER III.,
4028,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, yes.  You see, my dear, when I 'm fairly cornered, I scorns to"
4029,CHAPTER III.,lie.  That same _was_ one of the little thaving operations of the late
4030,CHAPTER III.,"Mrs. Magee, Heaven rest her sowl!"" said Patrick, rolling his eyes."
4031,CHAPTER III.,
4032,CHAPTER III.,"""O, then, for mercy's sake, tell me who and where are my parents!"""
4033,CHAPTER III.,"cried Molly, clasping her hands in an agony of entreaty."
4034,CHAPTER III.,
4035,CHAPTER III.,"""Softly, softly; bide a bit, my darling.  Nothing is sold for nothing."
4036,CHAPTER III.,I can niver consint to blacken the memory of my poor departed Biddy
4037,CHAPTER III.,"without a consideration."""
4038,CHAPTER III.,
4039,CHAPTER III.,"""What do you mean?"""
4040,CHAPTER III.,
4041,CHAPTER III.,"""Pay me fifty dollars, and I 'll make a clane breast of it, and tell"
4042,CHAPTER III.,"you all you want to know."""
4043,CHAPTER III.,
4044,CHAPTER III.,"""But, Mr. Magee,"" cried Molly, in distress, ""I have not so much money."
4045,CHAPTER III.,I have only a very few dollars of my own in the world; but I will
4046,CHAPTER III.,"promise to give it to you, and more too, as soon as I can earn it."
4047,CHAPTER III.,"Only tell me."""
4048,CHAPTER III.,
4049,CHAPTER III.,"""No, miss, I must be paid down.  'A bird in the hand is worth two in"
4050,CHAPTER III.,"the bush.'  If you have n't the money, belike your new governor, Mr."
4051,CHAPTER III.,"Morton, would pay a trifle like that for the sake of getting rid of"
4052,CHAPTER III.,"you."""
4053,CHAPTER III.,
4054,CHAPTER III.,"""He _might_ advance it for me; though he is not rich, he is so good,"""
4055,CHAPTER III.,"rejoined Molly.  ""I would ask you to come up to the house and see, only"
4056,CHAPTER III.,"he is away from home, and is not expected back till late in the"
4057,CHAPTER III.,"evening.  Please, _please_ tell me now, and trust me for your reward."
4058,CHAPTER III.,"Indeed, indeed, I will pay you some time, and be your friend always."""
4059,CHAPTER III.,
4060,CHAPTER III.,"""Your servant, miss,"" replied Patrick, with a mocking bow, ""but I 'd"
4061,CHAPTER III.,rather not trust a fine lady as has just scorned an ould friend in
4062,CHAPTER III.,"reduced circumstances, who, if he is n't her father, sure it's no fault"
4063,CHAPTER III.,"of his.  Tell your Mr. Morton that I 'll call to-morrow morning, ready"
4064,CHAPTER III.,"to arrange matters in a business-like, gintlemanly way.  But mind, _no"
4065,CHAPTER III.,"money, no sacret_.  I 'll not have my family affairs paraded in the"
4066,CHAPTER III.,"newspapers for nothing, and all Mrs. Magee's little wakenesses exposed,"
4067,CHAPTER III.,"after she's left this wicked world, and the _crowner_ has set on her,"
4068,CHAPTER III.,"and she's been dacently buried at the city's expinse, hard on to six"
4069,CHAPTER III.,"years."""
4070,CHAPTER III.,
4071,CHAPTER III.,"Molly reached home in a state of intense excitement, but, on relating"
4072,CHAPTER III.,"her strange story, was soothed and cheered by Mrs. Morton's tender,"
4073,CHAPTER III.,motherly sympathy.  Mr. Morton came home earlier than he was looked
4074,CHAPTER III.,"for, and was at once informed of the important revelation which Mr."
4075,CHAPTER III.,"Magee proposed to make for a ""consideration.""  Doubtful what course to"
4076,CHAPTER III.,"pursue, he hurried into the village to consult with Molly's first"
4077,CHAPTER III.,"friends, the Raeburns.  The consequence of this consultation was, that"
4078,CHAPTER III.,"the next morning, when Patrick Magee appeared at the farm-house, he was"
4079,CHAPTER III.,"confronted, not alone by Mr. Morton, but by Mr. Raeburn and the sheriff"
4080,CHAPTER III.,"of the county.  Taking these as mere witnesses, however, he was not"
4081,CHAPTER III.,"abashed, but greeted all with a jaunty air, and the old Irish"
4082,CHAPTER III.,"expression, ""The top of the morning to ye, gintlemen."""
4083,CHAPTER III.,
4084,CHAPTER III.,"On Mr. Morton referring to the secret he had to reveal, he said, with"
4085,CHAPTER III.,"the utmost assurance, ""Well, Mr. Morton, I 've slept on that same"
4086,CHAPTER III.,"matter, and I 've concluded that I can't in conscience consint to"
4087,CHAPTER III.,blacken the memory of the late Mrs. Magee for less nor a _hundred
4088,CHAPTER III.,"dollars_.  And sure, your honors, a rale live father and mother, rich"
4089,CHAPTER III.,"and respectable, are chape at that, to say nothing of the reputation of"
4090,CHAPTER III.,"a poor, hard-working woman, that's dead and gone, and can't defind"
4091,CHAPTER III.,"herself."""
4092,CHAPTER III.,
4093,CHAPTER III.,"""These, Mr. Magee, are the best terms you offer, then?"" asked the"
4094,CHAPTER III.,farmer.
4095,CHAPTER III.,
4096,CHAPTER III.,"""Yes; but if you don't close the bargain immadiately, I may rise a"
4097,CHAPTER III.,"trifle.  I 've been too aisy, on account of poor Molly.  My feelings"
4098,CHAPTER III.,"are too much for me."""
4099,CHAPTER III.,
4100,CHAPTER III.,"""Then, Mr. Sheriff,"" said Mr. Morton, ""you must do your duty."""
4101,CHAPTER III.,
4102,CHAPTER III.,So Patrick Magee found himself again in the stern grasp of the law.  He
4103,CHAPTER III.,"was taken to a magistrate's office for examination, but there he"
4104,CHAPTER III.,"obstinately refused to reveal a word of the important secret, saying he"
4105,CHAPTER III.,"would die first.  So he was committed to the county jail, there to"
4106,CHAPTER III.,await his trial on a charge of kidnapping.
4107,CHAPTER III.,
4108,CHAPTER III.,"For more than a week the prisoner remained sullenly silent, while poor"
4109,CHAPTER III.,"Molly suffered agonies of suspense, and her friends were fearful that"
4110,CHAPTER III.,"for lack of sufficient evidence the villain might yet escape justice,"
4111,CHAPTER III.,carrying his secret with him.
4112,CHAPTER III.,
4113,CHAPTER III.,"But at last he yielded,--subdued, not by hard fare, hard words, or"
4114,CHAPTER III.,"solitude, but by the mad thirst of the inebriate.  Since leaving the"
4115,CHAPTER III.,"penitentiary he had been drinking very hard, and now, being suddenly"
4116,CHAPTER III.,"deprived of all stimulants, his spirits sunk, his strength and appetite"
4117,CHAPTER III.,"failed, and he was threatened with the terrible disease of the"
4118,CHAPTER III.,"intemperate,--_delirium tremens_."
4119,CHAPTER III.,
4120,CHAPTER III.,"Being told by the doctor that he thought Magee must have some brandy,"
4121,CHAPTER III.,Mr. Raeburn paid a visit to the jail.  He found the prisoner sitting on
4122,CHAPTER III.,"his narrow bed, looking haggard and ill, but as sullen as ever."
4123,CHAPTER III.,
4124,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, Magee,"" said Mr. Raeburn, pleasantly, ""have you made up your"
4125,CHAPTER III.,mind to tell all you know of the parentage of that stolen child?  You
4126,CHAPTER III.,"have confessed that you connived at, if you did not assist in the"
4127,CHAPTER III.,"crime, and it may go hard with you at the trial."""
4128,CHAPTER III.,
4129,CHAPTER III.,"Patrick replied, with a furious oath, ""Niver a word more will I spake"
4130,CHAPTER III.,"about the matter, if they hang me."""
4131,CHAPTER III.,
4132,CHAPTER III.,"""If I will endeavor to get you discharged; if I will promise to give"
4133,CHAPTER III.,"you some decent clothes, and to furnish you with easy and constant"
4134,CHAPTER III.,"employment, will you tell?"""
4135,CHAPTER III.,
4136,CHAPTER III.,"""No."""
4137,CHAPTER III.,
4138,CHAPTER III.,"""If I will give you a glass of good brandy, will you tell?"""
4139,CHAPTER III.,
4140,CHAPTER III.,"Patrick started, and his dull eyes flashed, but with his old cunning he"
4141,CHAPTER III.,"replied, ""Show me first the brandy."""
4142,CHAPTER III.,
4143,CHAPTER III.,Mr. Raeburn took a flask from his pocket and poured out a glass nearly
4144,CHAPTER III.,"full.  With a trembling, outstretched hand, the poor sot cried, ""Yes,"
4145,CHAPTER III.,"yes, yer honor, give it to me, and on my word, on my sowl, I'll tell."""
4146,CHAPTER III.,
4147,CHAPTER III.,"The glass was given him, and he drained it with a sort of frantic"
4148,CHAPTER III.,"relish; then almost immediately, and very hurriedly, began his story."
4149,CHAPTER III.,
4150,CHAPTER III.,"""Molly's father is Squire Phillips, a mighty clever lawyer and a rich"
4151,CHAPTER III.,"man.  He lives at Newburgh, on the Hudson, forninst Fishkill; you mind"
4152,CHAPTER III.,"the town?"""
4153,CHAPTER III.,
4154,CHAPTER III.,"""Yes, and I have heard of Mr. Phillips; go on."""
4155,CHAPTER III.,
4156,CHAPTER III.,"""I should have said he has an office in Newburgh, but he lives on a"
4157,CHAPTER III.,"fine place up the river, out of town, a couple of miles or so.  You"
4158,CHAPTER III.,"see, when ill-luck sent me over from Ireland, where I lived in ease and"
4159,CHAPTER III.,"plenty, never taking up a spade but for devarsion, after a hard day"
4160,CHAPTER III.,"following the hounds or riding steeple-chases, I lived with Mr."
4161,CHAPTER III.,"Phillips as gardener.  But he and I niver could agree, and so parted;"
4162,CHAPTER III.,"and soon after my Biddy, who was the cook, was discharged for taking a"
4163,CHAPTER III.,drop too much just.  You see she fell down stairs with the tea-tray.
4164,CHAPTER III.,"So she had a spite against the master on my account, and against the"
4165,CHAPTER III.,"mistress on her own account, and vowed by all the saints she 'd be aven"
4166,CHAPTER III.,"with them.  After we settled in New York, many's the trip she took up"
4167,CHAPTER III.,"the river to prowl about the place (women is quare cratures, yer honor)"
4168,CHAPTER III.,for a chance to balance accounts.  But she never got a shy at them till
4169,CHAPTER III.,"one afternoon, just before dark, she found little Miss Mary, Mistress"
4170,CHAPTER III.,"Phillips's one child, playing alone on the river-bank, out of sight of"
4171,CHAPTER III.,the house; it's likely she 'd run away from a lazy nurse.  My Biddy
4172,CHAPTER III.,wasn't one of the kind that dilly-dallies or shilly-shallies: she
4173,CHAPTER III.,"pounces on the child like a hawk on a chicken, stops its mouth so it"
4174,CHAPTER III.,"could n't as much as peep, and carries it into a wood near by and hides"
4175,CHAPTER III.,"till dark.  Then she takes it over to Fishkill, where she has friends,"
4176,CHAPTER III.,"who lend her proper clothes for the child, and give it a drink that"
4177,CHAPTER III.,hushes its crying like magic just.  Then she takes the night-boat for
4178,CHAPTER III.,"New York, and in the big, crowded city the child was as completely lost"
4179,CHAPTER III.,as the small chicken I likened her to would be if the hawk should drop
4180,CHAPTER III.,it in a wide sea-marsh.  There was a great hue and cry about 'the
4181,CHAPTER III.,"mysterious disappearance of the only child of John Phillips, Esq.,'"
4182,CHAPTER III.,"(just as if no poor, hard-working man ever lost an only child!) but"
4183,CHAPTER III.,"most of the newspapers drowned her, I believe.  Biddy kept her mighty"
4184,CHAPTER III.,"close for a time, and sheared off her curls, but niver a hound of a"
4185,CHAPTER III.,detective smelt at our door.
4186,CHAPTER III.,

4230,CHAPTER III.,"full.  On reaching her pleasant chamber, where her trunk stood ready"
4231,CHAPTER III.,"packed for the journey, she sank on her knees beside her dear little"

4257,CHAPTER III.,"Molly was wakened early in the morning by the carol of an oriole, but"
4258,CHAPTER III.,"she could make nothing of his song but ""Good by, good by, good by!"" and"
4259,CHAPTER III.,the clambering roses by her window seemed sending in sweet farewell

4266,CHAPTER IV.,
4267,CHAPTER IV.,"It was the afternoon of a cool, showery summer day, when Mr. Raeburn"
4268,CHAPTER IV.,"and Mary drove through a handsome stone gateway, and up an avenue of"
4269,CHAPTER IV.,"maples, to the fine old-fashioned mansion of Mr. Phillips.  As they"
4270,CHAPTER IV.,"stood on the steps, Mr. Raeburn noticed that Mary had been much"
4271,CHAPTER IV.,"agitated by recognizing scenes once familiar to her baby eyes, and he"
4272,CHAPTER IV.,"begged her to try to be calm.  ""Remember,"" he said, ""we have no"
4273,CHAPTER IV.,"positive, reliable evidence that you are the lost child of Mr. and Mrs."
4274,CHAPTER IV.,Phillips.  You must not suddenly proclaim yourself.  They have probably
4275,CHAPTER IV.,"despaired so long that they will be unable to credit your story, if too"
4276,CHAPTER IV.,"abruptly told, and any repulse would be very painful to you.  Leave it"
4277,CHAPTER IV.,"to me to let the joyful light gradually in upon their minds, and second"
4278,CHAPTER IV.,"me when I refer to you."""
4279,CHAPTER IV.,
4280,CHAPTER IV.,"""I will do so; trust me,"" replied Mary, in a low voice."
4281,CHAPTER IV.,
4282,CHAPTER IV.,"When the servant came to the door, Mr. Raeburn inquired for Mr."
4283,CHAPTER IV.,"Phillips only, thinking it best that the first communication should be"
4284,CHAPTER IV.,"made to him alone.  They were shown into a pleasant library, opening on"
4285,CHAPTER IV.,"to a piazza by French windows, looking towards the river.  Mary seated"
4286,CHAPTER IV.,"herself on a sofa, in the most shadowed part of the room, and kept her"
4287,CHAPTER IV.,"face hidden by a thick veil.  She sat in silence, except that to her"
4288,CHAPTER IV.,"ear the beatings of her loving, impatient heart were audible.  It"
4289,CHAPTER IV.,"seemed to her a long hour that they were kept waiting, though it was"
4290,CHAPTER IV.,"probably not more than fifteen minutes.  Then the door gently opened,"
4291,CHAPTER IV.,"and Mr. Phillips entered.  Mary half rose, then sank back, faint with"
4292,CHAPTER IV.,"happiness, for she had recognized his face,--_it was that of her"
4293,CHAPTER IV.,dream-father_!
4294,CHAPTER IV.,
4295,CHAPTER IV.,Mr. Phillips was of middle age; the dark-brown curls of his hair were
4296,CHAPTER IV.,"slightly tinged with silver.  His face was very thoughtful, if not sad"
4297,CHAPTER IV.,"in expression.  His form was stately, and his manner courteous and"
4298,CHAPTER IV.,"refined,--a gentleman, every inch of him."
4299,CHAPTER IV.,
4300,CHAPTER IV.,"He pleasantly greeted by name Mr. Raeburn, who then introduced his"
4301,CHAPTER IV.,"companion as ""Miss Morton.""  Mary rose, courtesied, and again sank into"
4302,CHAPTER IV.,her seat.  The galloping heart was getting almost too much for
4303,CHAPTER IV.,"her,--she was gasping under her veil."
4304,CHAPTER IV.,
4305,CHAPTER IV.,"Mr. Phillips apologized for keeping his visitor so long waiting, and"
4306,CHAPTER IV.,"added, ""When word was brought me of your arrival, I was assisting in"
4307,CHAPTER IV.,carrying Mrs. Phillips from her sitting-room to her bedchamber.  She is
4308,CHAPTER IV.,"ill."""
4309,CHAPTER IV.,
4310,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary started, and a new terror seized her."
4311,CHAPTER IV.,
4312,CHAPTER IV.,"""Not seriously ill, I hope?"" said Mr. Raeburn."
4313,CHAPTER IV.,
4314,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, we trust not, now; but she has been very ill from a fever, and is"
4315,CHAPTER IV.,still extremely delicate.  She has been a good deal of an invalid for
4316,CHAPTER IV.,"the past fifteen years,"" said Mr. Phillips with a sigh."
4317,CHAPTER IV.,
4318,CHAPTER IV.,"After a plan formed that morning, Mr. Raeburn then requested the"
4319,CHAPTER IV.,"opinion of Mr. Phillips, as a lawyer, on an important land claim in"
4320,CHAPTER IV.,which he was interested.
4321,CHAPTER IV.,
4322,CHAPTER IV.,"As they talked on and on, Mary still sat silent and motionless.  She"
4323,CHAPTER IV.,"was hardly impatient any longer, for had she not her father's face to"
4324,CHAPTER IV.,"watch, and his voice to listen to?"
4325,CHAPTER IV.,
4326,CHAPTER IV.,At length there was a pause; then the two gentlemen began to talk about
4327,CHAPTER IV.,"the lovely scenery around them, the river, the estate, the Phillips"
4328,CHAPTER IV.,"mansion and family, and finally Mr. Raeburn said, ""I think I have"
4329,CHAPTER IV.,"heard, Mr. Phillips, a sad story of your having once lost a little"
4330,CHAPTER IV.,child in some mysterious way.  Perhaps at this remote day you will not
4331,CHAPTER IV.,"be unwilling to give me the facts of this loss."""
4332,CHAPTER IV.,
4333,CHAPTER IV.,"""Certainly not, my dear sir,"" replied Mr. Phillips, ""if you care to"
4334,CHAPTER IV.,hear so melancholy a tale.  All I myself know can be soon told.  Our
4335,CHAPTER IV.,"first child was a daughter,--a lovely, engaging little creature, the"
4336,CHAPTER IV.,"very light of our eyes.  She was rather delicate, and most carefully"
4337,CHAPTER IV.,"tended and watched till she was past three years of age.  Then, one"
4338,CHAPTER IV.,"summer day, I invited my wife to accompany me to New York, where I had"
4339,CHAPTER IV.,"business, and she had--as what woman has not?--shopping to attend to."
4340,CHAPTER IV.,"She hesitated, as little Mary's nurse was young and rather thoughtless,"
4341,CHAPTER IV.,"but I over-persuaded her and she went, giving at the last moment many"
4342,CHAPTER IV.,charges to the young girl concerning the child.
4343,CHAPTER IV.,
4344,CHAPTER IV.,"""I remember how lovingly little Mary kissed us good by that morning,"
4345,CHAPTER IV.,"and how, still unsatisfied, she ran after the carriage, commanding the"
4346,CHAPTER IV.,"coachman, in a pretty, imperious way she had, to stop till she could"
4347,CHAPTER IV.,"get another kiss.  I was a little vexed, fearing we should miss the"
4348,CHAPTER IV.,"train, yet she was obeyed, lifted up, kissed, and put down into her"
4349,CHAPTER IV.,"nurse's arms, and that was the last we ever saw of her.  How thankful I"
4350,CHAPTER IV.,have always been that we stopped for her good-by kiss.  Many a time
4351,CHAPTER IV.,"since, in my sleep, I have felt that last kiss on my lips."
4352,CHAPTER IV.,
4353,CHAPTER IV.,"""We had intended to stay till the afternoon of the next day, in New"
4354,CHAPTER IV.,"York, but at evening Mrs. Phillips grew so strangely anxious about her"
4355,CHAPTER IV.,"baby girl, whom she had never before left for a night, that we took a"
4356,CHAPTER IV.,"late train for home.  Just as we reached our station, I noticed a New"
4357,CHAPTER IV.,York boat put off from the landing.  I have since thought it was
4358,CHAPTER IV.,"possible our child was on that boat."""
4359,CHAPTER IV.,
4360,CHAPTER IV.,"Here Mary could scarcely restrain herself from crying out, ""She was!"
4361,CHAPTER IV.,"she was!"" but she shut her lips and clasped her hands tight, and was"
4362,CHAPTER IV.,still.
4363,CHAPTER IV.,
4364,CHAPTER IV.,"""When we reached home,"" continued Mr. Phillips, ""we found all in"
4365,CHAPTER IV.,"confusion and consternation, Our darling little one was missing!  She"
4366,CHAPTER IV.,"had not been seen since five o'clock, at which time she had been left"
4367,CHAPTER IV.,"by her nurse fast asleep, and to all human apprehension in perfect"
4368,CHAPTER IV.,safety.  On that day she had been allowed to have the range of the
4369,CHAPTER IV.,"house, and taking a freak to have her belated afternoon nap on the"
4370,CHAPTER IV.,"drawing-room sofa, was there put to sleep."
4371,CHAPTER IV.,
4372,CHAPTER IV.,"""The nurse took the opportunity to have a little gossip with the cook"
4373,CHAPTER IV.,"and coachman, in the kitchen, and it was a good deal more than an hour,"
4374,CHAPTER IV.,"I believe, though she declared it was not half that time, before she"
4375,CHAPTER IV.,went to look after her charge.  The room was empty; the low window was
4376,CHAPTER IV.,"open, and our bird had flown forever!"
4377,CHAPTER IV.,
4378,CHAPTER IV.,"""It was some time before the servants were really alarmed, as it was"
4379,CHAPTER IV.,"thought she was somewhere in the house or garden, hiding, after her"
4380,CHAPTER IV.,roguish way.  I think it was actually dark before they made any serious
4381,CHAPTER IV.,"and thorough effort to find her.  Indeed, I set on foot the first"
4382,CHAPTER IV.,"systematic search.  I roused all our neighbors, and employed the police"
4383,CHAPTER IV.,"of our town, and afterwards of New York and other cities; but all was"
4384,CHAPTER IV.,"in vain, utterly in vain!  No real trace of her could be found.  We"
4385,CHAPTER IV.,"could not even hear of any child answering to her description, as"
4386,CHAPTER IV.,"having been taken from the town on that day, in any direction,--except"
4387,CHAPTER IV.,"one, who was seen on the New York boat I have mentioned, and who must,"
4388,CHAPTER IV.,"I think, have been younger than ours, or it was ill or stupid, as it"
4389,CHAPTER IV.,was said the woman who had charge of it carried it constantly in her
4390,CHAPTER IV.,"arms, where it lay quite still.  Even this child we could only trace as"
4391,CHAPTER IV.,far as New York.  It seemed to disappear in the great city as a
4392,CHAPTER IV.,snowflake melts in the sea.
4393,CHAPTER IV.,
4394,CHAPTER IV.,"""Our friends all believed that our little Mary had fallen from the"
4395,CHAPTER IV.,"river-bank and had been drowned, and the body carried away by the swift"
4396,CHAPTER IV.,"current.  Some lads, who were out on the water that day in a sail-boat,"
4397,CHAPTER IV.,"said that they saw a child on the bank a little below our house,"
4398,CHAPTER IV.,"running about quite alone, apparently chasing butterflies.  But it was"
4399,CHAPTER IV.,several months before we relaxed our efforts to find her.  So many lost
4400,CHAPTER IV.,"children were brought to us in answer to our advertisements,--so many"
4401,CHAPTER IV.,"poor little homeless ones, whom nobody owned,--that it looked as though"
4402,CHAPTER IV.,"we were about to set up an orphan asylum.  In truth, we sometimes felt"
4403,CHAPTER IV.,"like it, for dear little Mary's sake.  We could not give her up, for we"
4404,CHAPTER IV.,could not believe her dead.  Our sorrow was such a _live_
4405,CHAPTER IV.,"anguish--without comfort, without rest--that we felt that the dear"
4406,CHAPTER IV.,object _must_ be living and suffering.  The tender ties that had bound
4407,CHAPTER IV.,"our hearts to her quivered with pain, but we felt that, though sorely"
4408,CHAPTER IV.,"wounded, they were not quite severed."
4409,CHAPTER IV.,
4410,CHAPTER IV.,"""Then we had strangely vivid dreams of her.  Very sad dreams they were;"
4411,CHAPTER IV.,"she always appeared to us pale, and sorrowful, and thin, as though"
4412,CHAPTER IV.,pinched with want.  Of late years we have dreamed of her more seldom;
4413,CHAPTER IV.,"and, singularly enough, when we have dreamed, she has worn to both of"
4414,CHAPTER IV.,"us a changed and happier look.  So we feel at last that somewhere, in"
4415,CHAPTER IV.,"this or a better world, 'it is well with the child.'"
4416,CHAPTER IV.,
4417,CHAPTER IV.,"""The health of Mrs. Phillips received a great shock in this loss; in"
4418,CHAPTER IV.,"fact, she has never been quite well since.  She has been threatened"
4419,CHAPTER IV.,"with consumption, and has been obliged to spend most of her winters in"
4420,CHAPTER IV.,the South.  I think she still mourns for her first-born; no other child
4421,CHAPTER IV.,"has yet been able to fill her place."""
4422,CHAPTER IV.,
4423,CHAPTER IV.,"""You have then other children?"" said Mr. Raeburn."
4424,CHAPTER IV.,
4425,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, three; two boys, of eleven and nine, and a little girl, now"
4426,CHAPTER IV.,"nearly five years old."""
4427,CHAPTER IV.,
4428,CHAPTER IV.,"Here Mary felt a happy glow overspread her veiled face, and her heart"
4429,CHAPTER IV.,palpitated with a new joy.
4430,CHAPTER IV.,
4431,CHAPTER IV.,
4432,CHAPTER IV.,"""Believe me, my dear sir,"" said Mr. Raeburn, after a pause, ""I have not"
4433,CHAPTER IV.,drawn from you this painful story from mere curiosity.  My friend now
4434,CHAPTER IV.,"present, Miss Morton, is acquainted with a young girl who believes"
4435,CHAPTER IV.,"herself to have been stolen in her early childhood, from a happy home"
4436,CHAPTER IV.,"and kind parents, by a vulgar and cruel woman, who hid her for years in"
4437,CHAPTER IV.,"a wretched den in the worst part of New York.  But, my dear Miss"
4438,CHAPTER IV.,"Morton, you can tell the story better than I; will you not do so?"""
4439,CHAPTER IV.,
4440,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary began in a voice low and tremulous, but of penetrating sweetness,"
4441,CHAPTER IV.,"thus: ""That poor young girl was, while yet a child, not wholly lost and"
4442,CHAPTER IV.,"wicked, rescued from a life of sin and beggary by some good kind"
4443,CHAPTER IV.,"friends, whom God will bless for ever and ever!  When they took pity on"
4444,CHAPTER IV.,"her, she had forgotten her true last name; it had been frightened out"
4445,CHAPTER IV.,"of her memory, or driven out by blows; but she knew that her first name"
4446,CHAPTER IV.,"was Mary, though she was only called _Molly_, and she had not forgotten"
4447,CHAPTER IV.,"her true parents, though she called them her _dream_ father and mother,"
4448,CHAPTER IV.,"because they came to her in her sleep, to kiss her and comfort her."
4449,CHAPTER IV.,She was surrounded by squalor and wretchedness; but she never quite
4450,CHAPTER IV.,"forgot her old beautiful home, for her dim sweet memories of it were"
4451,CHAPTER IV.,"all she knew of heaven."""
4452,CHAPTER IV.,
4453,CHAPTER IV.,"Here Mary rose and threw back her veil, as she continued, ""And she"
4454,CHAPTER IV.,"hopes, she believes that _this_ is her old home, for she recognizes"
4455,CHAPTER IV.,"everything around her.  O yes, I know that carved mantel, that ebony"
4456,CHAPTER IV.,"writing-case, that screen, that bust, and that picture over the"
4457,CHAPTER IV.,"cabinet.  _It is mamma's portrait!_"""
4458,CHAPTER IV.,
4459,CHAPTER IV.,Mr. Phillips uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise and started
4460,CHAPTER IV.,"forward, but immediately fearful of some mistake, calmed himself, and"
4461,CHAPTER IV.,"merely said, ""Will you let me see you without your bonnet?"""
4462,CHAPTER IV.,
4463,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary hastily uncovered her beautiful head, and stood before him, a"
4464,CHAPTER IV.,"soft, timid smile playing about her lips, and a tremulous light of love"
4465,CHAPTER IV.,and joy in her eyes.  Mr. Phillips looked from that yearning young face
4466,CHAPTER IV.,"to the one on the canvas,--so wonderfully like they were!  ""It is"
4467,CHAPTER IV.,"enough!"" he exclaimed; ""I _know_ you for our daughter, our long-lost"
4468,CHAPTER IV.,"lamb!  O Father in heaven, I thank Thee!"""
4469,CHAPTER IV.,
4470,CHAPTER IV.,"And the next moment Mary was clasped in her father's arms, her head on"
4471,CHAPTER IV.,"his breast, her arms about his neck, laughing and weeping in her"
4472,CHAPTER IV.,"passionate emotion, so long restrained."
4473,CHAPTER IV.,
4474,CHAPTER IV.,"Mr. Raeburn rose and softly loft the room, passing out on to the"
4475,CHAPTER IV.,"piazza, where he stood for many minutes, apparently admiring the fine"
4476,CHAPTER IV.,"scenery, though in fact he could see but little for the tears of tender"
4477,CHAPTER IV.,sympathy that would spring to his kindly eyes.  Whichever way he looked
4478,CHAPTER IV.,there was a water-view.
4479,CHAPTER IV.,
4480,CHAPTER IV.,"He returned just in time to see the two boys, George and Herbert,"
4481,CHAPTER IV.,introduced to their sister.  They received the good news at first in a
4482,CHAPTER IV.,"bewildered, boyish, awkward way.  They blushed and stammered, stepped"
4483,CHAPTER IV.,"forward and back, then stood stock still, and looked at Mary in silent,"
4484,CHAPTER IV.,wide-eyed wonder and admiration.
4485,CHAPTER IV.,
4486,CHAPTER IV.,"""Ah, boys,"" she said, ""I suppose I seem to you like one come back from"
4487,CHAPTER IV.,"the dead, or like another Undine, risen from the water; but won't you"
4488,CHAPTER IV.,"take my hand? see, it isn't cold!""  Then she shook hands with them and"
4489,CHAPTER IV.,"kissed them, and they rapturously returned her caress, and all was"
4490,CHAPTER IV.,right.
4491,CHAPTER IV.,
4492,CHAPTER IV.,"""Now, my dear boys,"" said Mr. Phillips, ""you have a task of"
4493,CHAPTER IV.,self-restraint before you.  It is necessary that this great joy of ours
4494,CHAPTER IV.,should be kept awhile from your mother.  She is not strong enough to
4495,CHAPTER IV.,bear it.  But she must see Mary and get accustomed to her as soon as
4496,CHAPTER IV.,possible.  I have a plan.  A new nurse is needed for Lilly; will you
4497,CHAPTER IV.,"accept the position for a few days, my darling?"""
4498,CHAPTER IV.,
4499,CHAPTER IV.,"""Most joyfully, papa."""
4500,CHAPTER IV.,
4501,CHAPTER IV.,"""I give you warning, sister, that it will not be a very jolly life for"
4502,CHAPTER IV.,"you,"" put in Master George.  ""Lilly is awfully spoiled, and will order"
4503,CHAPTER IV.,"you about, and put on all the airs of old Queen Bess."""
4504,CHAPTER IV.,
4505,CHAPTER IV.,"""That will do, George,"" said his father, with a wave of his hand."
4506,CHAPTER IV.,"""You, Mary, I am sure, will soon win Lilly's heart, though she is quite"
4507,CHAPTER IV.,"too young to be intrusted with our secret.  Having charge of her, you"
4508,CHAPTER IV.,"can have frequent access to your mother, and perhaps gradually reveal"
4509,CHAPTER IV.,yourself to her.  We must contrive to have you get your first glimpse
4510,CHAPTER IV.,"of her unseen, otherwise you might betray yourself by your emotion."
4511,CHAPTER IV.,
4512,CHAPTER IV.,"""And now, my daughter, if you are sufficiently calm, you will give me a"
4513,CHAPTER IV.,"brief account of your life since we were so sadly parted, more than"
4514,CHAPTER IV.,"twelve long years ago."""
4515,CHAPTER IV.,
4516,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary told her piteous story very simply, passing as lightly as possible"
4517,CHAPTER IV.,"over her early sorrows and hardships, but again and again bringing"
4518,CHAPTER IV.,tears to the eyes of her father and brothers.
4519,CHAPTER IV.,
4520,CHAPTER IV.,"When Mr. Phillips heard the name of Patrick Magee, he exclaimed, ""Why,"
4521,CHAPTER IV.,I had that villain under pay for months for pretending to search for
4522,CHAPTER IV.,"you in New York, and all along he had you hid in his vile den!  He must"

4524,CHAPTER IV.,
4525,CHAPTER IV.,"""He will suffer, he does suffer, father.  Poor, lost creature!  I am"

4531,CHAPTER IV.,
4532,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary came to him, all radiant with her new happiness.  ""I have seen my"
4533,CHAPTER IV.,"mother twice!"" she said.  ""The first time she was asleep.  I stole up"
4534,CHAPTER IV.,"softly to her bedside, and held my breath as I bent over her.  Her face"
4535,CHAPTER IV.,"is no longer rosy and dimpled, like the pictured face, yet far"
4536,CHAPTER IV.,"lovelier.  In repose it seemed worn and sorrowful, but O, so gentle and"
4537,CHAPTER IV.,"sweet!  I stood by her a long time, and looked and looked, trying to"
4538,CHAPTER IV.,make up a little for what I had lost.  Her dear hand lay on the
4539,CHAPTER IV.,"counterpane.  I longed to kiss it, but I dared not.  I did kiss a braid"
4540,CHAPTER IV.,"of her hair that fell over the pillow, and such a thrill went through"
4541,CHAPTER IV.,"me!  Her hair is as beautiful and dark as ever, and so are her eyes.  I"
4542,CHAPTER IV.,"looked straight into them, once this morning.  Papa presented me to"
4543,CHAPTER IV.,"her, as Lilly's new nurse.  She looked so kind and gracious, I thought"
4544,CHAPTER IV.,"I should have sunk at her feet, to beg her to bless her child.  I could"
4545,CHAPTER IV.,"not speak, and papa apologized for me by saying that I was very"
4546,CHAPTER IV.,"diffident, but that Lilly seemed to take to me, and he hoped I would do"
4547,CHAPTER IV.,"well; and then she smiled on me, and I took that for the blessing."
4548,CHAPTER IV.,
4549,CHAPTER IV.,"""I slept in the nursery with Lilly last night, in the very bed, I"
4550,CHAPTER IV.,"believe, I used to sleep in; and when I knelt beside it, I could think"
4551,CHAPTER IV.,"of no words to say but those of my little childish prayer, '_Now I lay"
4552,CHAPTER IV.,"me down to sleep._'  Was n't it strange?"""
4553,CHAPTER IV.,
4554,CHAPTER IV.,"At this moment Lilly came dancing into the parlor, to claim her new"
4555,CHAPTER IV.,"friend.  The child was a dainty little thing, as restless and radiant"
4556,CHAPTER IV.,"as a butterfly,--evidently a little spoiled, yet very charming."
4557,CHAPTER IV.,
4558,CHAPTER IV.,"The tears sprang to Mary's eyes, as her good friend rose to take leave."
4559,CHAPTER IV.,She weighed down his memory with messages for the dear ones to whom he
4560,CHAPTER IV.,"was going; and, as he gave her his hand in parting, she lifted up her"
4561,CHAPTER IV.,"sweet, ingenuous face, with a timid, grateful smile, and kissed him,"
4562,CHAPTER IV.,for the first time.  She had never before felt that she had a social
4563,CHAPTER IV.,position equal to his and dear Bessie's.
4564,CHAPTER IV.,
4565,CHAPTER IV.,"Mr. Phillips accompanied Mr. Raeburn to the station, and parted from"
4566,CHAPTER IV.,him with much regret and many heartfelt thanks and blessings.
4567,CHAPTER IV.,
4568,CHAPTER IV.,A few days later there came to Mary letters from all her friends in
4569,CHAPTER IV.,"Berkshire,--letters of loving congratulation, most grateful to her"
4570,CHAPTER IV.,heart.  One from Mr. Raeburn contained the intelligence that Patrick
4571,CHAPTER IV.,Magee had been released from prison in a very solemn way.  After a
4572,CHAPTER IV.,"terrible attack of delirium, he had fallen into a stupor, and died.  So"
4573,CHAPTER IV.,"that sinful and blinded soul had gone stumbling down the dark valley,"
4574,CHAPTER IV.,"and forth into the unknown world, where neither human pity nor judgment"
4575,CHAPTER IV.,could reach him.
4576,CHAPTER IV.,
4577,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, I hope God forgave him at the last, as I forgive him,"" said Mary,"
4578,CHAPTER IV.,weeping.
4579,CHAPTER IV.,
4580,CHAPTER IV.,"""Why, sister Mary,"" said George Phillips, ""you are n't crying for that"
4581,CHAPTER IV.,"old reprobate, are you?"""
4582,CHAPTER IV.,
4583,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, Georgie; only crying because nobody _can_ cry for him.  You see,"
4584,CHAPTER IV.,"Georgie dear, I have been wicked myself, and know how to pity the"
4585,CHAPTER IV.,"erring."""
4586,CHAPTER IV.,
4587,CHAPTER IV.,"""_You_ wicked, Mary!  I suppose you have in your mind the few little"
4588,CHAPTER IV.,lies you told when you were the bound slave of that old Irish ogre and
4589,CHAPTER IV.,his ogress.  It's my opinion the angel that writes down things don't
4590,CHAPTER IV.,"make much account of such sins."""
4591,CHAPTER IV.,
4592,CHAPTER IV.,
4593,CHAPTER IV.,"Day by day, Mary won her way to the inmost hearts of all the household."
4594,CHAPTER IV.,"Mrs. Phillips was especially interested in the young stranger, who"
4595,CHAPTER IV.,"seemed so superior to her station,--who moved about so softly, and was"
4596,CHAPTER IV.,"so careful and watchful.  She loved to have her in her apartments, and"
4597,CHAPTER IV.,"often sat and gazed at her, so mournfully, so searchingly, that Mary"
4598,CHAPTER IV.,longed inexpressibly to kneel by her side and tell her all.
4599,CHAPTER IV.,
4600,CHAPTER IV.,"At last the time came.  It was Sunday, and little Lilly's birthday."
4601,CHAPTER IV.,"Mrs. Phillips was so much better that she was brought down stairs, for"
4602,CHAPTER IV.,"the first time for many weeks, and seated on the vine-shaded piazza,"
4603,CHAPTER IV.,"overlooking the river.  She looked very happy, and there was a delicate"
4604,CHAPTER IV.,rose-tint on her cheek.  All the family were gathered around her; it
4605,CHAPTER IV.,was a jubilee of love.  Her husband sat at her side; the boys stood
4606,CHAPTER IV.,"near, leaning over the railing, watching the graceful sloops sailing"
4607,CHAPTER IV.,"by.  Mary sat on a low stool before her, showing some Bible pictures to"
4608,CHAPTER IV.,"Lilly, who wore a birthday wreath of blue violets and white rosebuds."
4609,CHAPTER IV.,"Suddenly the child was heard to say, ""This is my birthday, you know,"
4610,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary, and that's why it's so pleasant.  When is your birthday?"""
4611,CHAPTER IV.,
4612,CHAPTER IV.,"""O, never mind,"" said Mary, blushing, ""look at this picture."""
4613,CHAPTER IV.,
4614,CHAPTER IV.,"""No, no, not till you tell me when your birthday comes."""
4615,CHAPTER IV.,
4616,CHAPTER IV.,"""I cannot tell you, dear."""
4617,CHAPTER IV.,
4618,CHAPTER IV.,"""Why, don't you know?  I 'm only five years old, and I know mine."""
4619,CHAPTER IV.,
4620,CHAPTER IV.,"""Why, how is this, Mary?"" asked Mrs. Phillips; ""don't you really know"
4621,CHAPTER IV.,"your birthday?"""
4622,CHAPTER IV.,
4623,CHAPTER IV.,"Mary hesitated a moment, then replied, ""There were some sad"
4624,CHAPTER IV.,circumstances in my childhood that prevented me from knowing much even
4625,CHAPTER IV.,"about myself.  I do not know _exactly_ how old I am, but I think about"
4626,CHAPTER IV.,"fifteen."""
4627,CHAPTER IV.,
4628,CHAPTER IV.,"""About fifteen!"" repeated Mrs. Phillips, in a dreamy way, ""and your"
4629,CHAPTER IV.,"name _Mary_.  John, our Mary would have been just about her age, could"
4630,CHAPTER IV.,we have kept her; and do you know I fancy she would have looked very
4631,CHAPTER IV.,much like this young girl.  I suppose this coincidence of age and name
4632,CHAPTER IV.,has given me a peculiar interest in her.  I felt strangely drawn
4633,CHAPTER IV.,towards her at first sight.  I have an odd idea that she looks like our
4634,CHAPTER IV.,"family, somewhat as I used to look; and, stranger still, like _you_,"
4635,CHAPTER IV.,"John."""
4636,CHAPTER IV.,
4637,CHAPTER IV.,"At this, all instinctively drew near to the mother.  Mr. Phillips took"
4638,CHAPTER IV.,"her hand, and said calmly, ""My dear Caroline, nobody on earth has a"
4639,CHAPTER IV.,"better right to look like our Mary, like you and like me, than this"
4640,CHAPTER IV.,"dear young girl."""
4641,CHAPTER IV.,
4642,CHAPTER IV.,"""O John, John, tell me!  Can she he!  O blessed God!--"""
4643,CHAPTER IV.,
4644,CHAPTER IV.,"She could not utter a word more, but she stretched out her trembling"
4645,CHAPTER IV.,"arms, and Mary crept into them and lay on her mother's breast, the long"
4646,CHAPTER IV.,hunger of her heart satisfied at last!
4647,CHAPTER IV.,
4648,CHAPTER IV.,[Illustration: Mary and her mother]
4649,CHAPTER IV.,
4650,CHAPTER IV.,"""Yes, dear, this _is_ our lost child, given back to us by a gracious"
4651,CHAPTER IV.,"God,"" said Mr. Phillips.  But there was no need to tell her that; she"
4652,CHAPTER IV.,"knew all now.  Kissing her darling, patting her head, and murmuring"
4653,CHAPTER IV.,"over her sweet pet names, as though Mary were still the baby girl she"
4654,CHAPTER IV.,"had lost, she sat for a few bewildered, rapturous moments, then sank"
4655,CHAPTER IV.,back in a swoon.  She lay with such a smile on her lips that those
4656,CHAPTER IV.,about her were little alarmed.  She had only fainted under her burden
4657,CHAPTER IV.,of happiness.  She afterwards said that this swoon was like a trance of
4658,CHAPTER IV.,"heavenly joy.  She revived with a sigh, thinking it all a dream,--but"
4659,CHAPTER IV.,we know it was n't.
4660,CHAPTER IV.,
4661,CHAPTER IV.,
4662,CHAPTER IV.,"I don't know that I have anything more to tell you, except that Mrs."
4663,CHAPTER IV.,"Phillips got well very rapidly, and did n't have to go South with the"
4664,CHAPTER IV.,"birds that year.  Joy and Love are very good physicians, though they"
4665,CHAPTER IV.,"practice without a diploma, in defiance of medical professors and all"
4666,CHAPTER IV.,the college of surgeons.
4667,CHAPTER IV.,
4668,CHAPTER IV.,"Yes, one other thing.  There was a great Christmas gathering at the"
4669,CHAPTER IV.,"Phillips mansion that year.  The Raeburns and Mortons were there, with"
4670,CHAPTER IV.,"a host of Mary's uncles, aunts, and cousins, and actually two pairs of"
4671,CHAPTER IV.,grandparents.  Only think how rich she was!
4672,CHAPTER IV.,
4673,CHAPTER IV.,"On Christmas-eve there was dancing and charade-acting, there were games"
4674,CHAPTER IV.,"and _tableaux_ in the great hall; and last and best of all, there was"
4675,CHAPTER IV.,story-telling around the fragrant wood-fire in the library.
4676,CHAPTER IV.,
4677,CHAPTER IV.,"Of all the stories told that night, there was none to compare,"
4678,CHAPTER IV.,"everybody said, with the one related by pretty Bessie Raeburn, of a"
4679,CHAPTER IV.,"certain Christmas adventure of hers, and of what came of it."
