1285,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1286,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"When a new school Reader comes to the hands of the primary teacher,"
1287,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,she naturally asks: “Will this book give to my class of boys and girls
1288,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,a healthy stimulus of thought and pleasure? Will they receive through
1289,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,it valuable instruction and assistance in the mechanics of reading? Is
1290,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,the book sufficiently literary in style and artistic in form to command
1291,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"the respect and love of the children? Is it suggestive, dramatic, and"
1292,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"ethically healthful? In a word, is it worth the precious time of the"
1293,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,schoolroom?”
1294,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1295,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"To the inquiring teacher who may examine this little book, which is"
1296,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"devoted entirely to the frolics and fancies of kittens and cats, the"
1297,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,following remarks may reveal a definite educational purpose and value in
1298,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,it.
1299,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1300,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"Following the example of Mother Goose, the wise and classic rhymester"
1301,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"of the nursery, we have taken a subject dear to the heart of childhood"
1302,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,and have given it life and personality in the simple and unsophisticated
1303,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,manner of the child.
1304,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1305,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,Many of the happiest playtime experiences of children are associated
1306,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,with their kittens. They delight to dress the frolicsome yet docile
1307,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"little creatures in doll gowns and jackets, and give them long rides"
1308,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"in doll carriages, and make them sit at tiny tables and share in tea"
1309,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"parties, then put them to bed and perhaps give them water medicine for"
1310,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,an imaginary ill. Can there be a more normal and healthy pastime for a
1311,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,little child than this?
1312,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1313,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,In one respect kittens take precedence over dolls. They are _alive_.
1314,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,They _must_ be treated kindly. They will not bear the abuse and neglect
1315,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"given to many beautiful dolls. They demand attention and companionship,"
1316,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,and they return a real devotion for kindness and care. Therefore we love
1317,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"them, and especially do our children love them and delight in stories or"
1318,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,pictures of them.
1319,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1320,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,Those of us who have had glimpses of the child heart and mind know that
1321,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,stories of kittens and queens and parties yield much the same delight to
1322,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"the little reader of juvenile fiction, as do adventure and romance to the"
1323,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,grown-up reader.
1324,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,
1325,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,This simple story about the Queen of the Kitten Country and the party
1326,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"which she gives in her palace, ought, therefore, to meet one of the most"
1327,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"important requirements for a higher first grade school Reader, that of a"
1328,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,strong appeal to the child in subject matter and illustration. With the
1329,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,interest keenly aroused the difficulties in learning to read are mastered
1330,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,"quickly and with pleasure. However, the following brief suggestions are"
1331,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,given to assist any teacher who may need them in making use of the book
1332,A WORD TO THE TEACHER,to the greatest advantage for her class.

1335,SUGGESTIONS,SUGGESTIONS
1336,SUGGESTIONS,
1337,SUGGESTIONS,Before the reading of the book is begun there might well be one or two
1338,SUGGESTIONS,"story-telling periods. Each child should be encouraged to tell a story,"
1339,SUGGESTIONS,"from his own experience if possible, about a kitten, or a party, or to"
1340,SUGGESTIONS,give his idea of a queen.
1341,SUGGESTIONS,
1342,SUGGESTIONS,The children should be assisted in recalling and in learning Mother Goose
1343,SUGGESTIONS,rhymes and other verses about cats. Give them several blackboard drawing
1344,SUGGESTIONS,lessons showing cats in different positions and costumes. A frieze of
1345,SUGGESTIONS,"kittens may be started at the top of the blackboard, adding each new"
1346,SUGGESTIONS,kitten character to the row as the story progresses. This frieze will
1347,SUGGESTIONS,furnish material for several varieties of “busy work.”
1348,SUGGESTIONS,
1349,SUGGESTIONS,A valuable exercise to stimulate thought and facility of expression is to
1350,SUGGESTIONS,"assign a short page for a child to read silently, which he later gives"
1351,SUGGESTIONS,aloud in his own words before the teacher and class.
1352,SUGGESTIONS,
1353,SUGGESTIONS,Interesting and profitable reviews may be frequently had by assigning a
1354,SUGGESTIONS,"cat character to each child, having them read in order the text devoted"
1355,SUGGESTIONS,to their special character. The first review of this kind may well occur
1356,SUGGESTIONS,"at the end of page twenty, where the preparations for the party are"
1357,SUGGESTIONS,completed. When the party is over a final review may be given in dramatic
1358,SUGGESTIONS,form. The children should impersonate the different cats and tell their
1359,SUGGESTIONS,"tales to amuse the Queen, who sits on her throne. This final dramatic"
1360,SUGGESTIONS,review would naturally begin with the call of the Commanding Officer on
1361,SUGGESTIONS,page twenty-two. Each child should memorize his part and give it with
1362,SUGGESTIONS,spontaneous expression and action. Slight costuming may be prepared if
1363,SUGGESTIONS,"desired, or the blackboard frieze may furnish the cat pictures, while the"
1364,SUGGESTIONS,children give life and action to them.
1365,SUGGESTIONS,
1366,SUGGESTIONS,Other special and valuable reviews may be developed from the large amount
1367,SUGGESTIONS,"of verse in the book, each child choosing a favorite verse to read"
1368,SUGGESTIONS,or recite or to illustrate on the blackboard. The children should be
1369,SUGGESTIONS,"encouraged to make rhyming sentences and word lists of their own, using"
1370,SUGGESTIONS,the fundamental thought or words in the day’s lesson as a basis. From
1371,SUGGESTIONS,"such rhymes and lists of rhyming words, phonic work may be developed as"
1372,SUGGESTIONS,the teacher chooses.
1373,SUGGESTIONS,
1374,SUGGESTIONS,There are about six hundred words in the vocabulary of “Kittens and
1375,SUGGESTIONS,"Cats,” and though it has not been mechanically graded, it should be"
1376,SUGGESTIONS,"within easy grasp of upper first grade pupils, after the usual Primer"
1377,SUGGESTIONS,work is done. Each page of the book is a complete brief story well suited
1378,SUGGESTIONS,"to the daily lesson period. These short stories are so related, however,"
1379,SUGGESTIONS,"as to make one continuous long story, thus keeping the interest of the"
1380,SUGGESTIONS,children keen throughout the book. Books of this nature have proved a
1381,SUGGESTIONS,"great stimulus to thoughtful and fluent reading, which, after all, is the"
1382,SUGGESTIONS,high aim in primary work.
