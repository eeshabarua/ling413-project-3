86,LITTLE MOTHER.,
87,LITTLE MOTHER.,
88,LITTLE MOTHER.,"ONE day Kitty's mother called her little daughter to her, and taking"
89,LITTLE MOTHER.,"both her dimpled dots of hands in her own soft white ones, said, ""Kitty,"
90,LITTLE MOTHER.,"my darling, I am going to New York this morning, to see your dear"
91,LITTLE MOTHER.,"grandma', and I shall have to leave the house in your charge until I"
92,LITTLE MOTHER.,"come back. Do you think you can be my little housekeeper for to-day?"""
93,LITTLE MOTHER.,
94,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Oh yes, mamma! I should like that so much! I will keep house as well as"
95,LITTLE MOTHER.,"you--that is, 'most, not quite!"" and Kitty jumped up and down for joy"
96,LITTLE MOTHER.,at being trusted with such important affairs.
97,LITTLE MOTHER.,
98,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""You must take care of dear little Luly and Walter, you know; see that"
99,LITTLE MOTHER.,"they have their dinners fixed right, and go out walking with them and"
100,LITTLE MOTHER.,"nurse; and if any company comes, you must go down and see them, and say"
101,LITTLE MOTHER.,"that mamma has gone to New York, will you?"""
102,LITTLE MOTHER.,
103,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Yes, mamma; I will be just as good as pie!"" said Kitty, earnestly;"
104,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Luly and Wawa will like to have me for a mother, I guess."""
105,LITTLE MOTHER.,
106,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Yes; you are their Little Mother for to-day,"" said her mamma. ""I know"
107,LITTLE MOTHER.,"you love me, Kitty, and want to save me all the trouble you can; it"
108,LITTLE MOTHER.,"will be a great comfort to me, while I am away, to feel that I can trust"
109,LITTLE MOTHER.,"you perfectly;"" and she kissed the little, rosy cheek, I'm sure I can't"
110,LITTLE MOTHER.,"tell how many times, and Kitty felt so proud and happy that she only"
111,LITTLE MOTHER.,wished she had been trusted with a much larger family of little brothers
112,LITTLE MOTHER.,"and sisters, instead of two; that she might show the more what an"
113,LITTLE MOTHER.,"excellent Little Mother she intended to be. You would wish so too,"
114,LITTLE MOTHER.,"wouldn't you! yes, of course!"
115,LITTLE MOTHER.,
116,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Kitty May lived with her papa and mamma, Luly and Walter, Mary the"
117,LITTLE MOTHER.,"nurse, and Betty the cook, three brown horses, two red cows, a black"
118,LITTLE MOTHER.,"dog, and a white kitten, at a beautiful country seat up the Hudson"
119,LITTLE MOTHER.,"River. She was only eight years old, but her obedience to her parents,"
120,LITTLE MOTHER.,"and tender, loving care of her little brother and sister, were beautiful"
121,LITTLE MOTHER.,"to see, and a shining example to some little girls I know. On the day"
122,LITTLE MOTHER.,"that I am telling you about, her papa had gone to town, as usual, early"
123,LITTLE MOTHER.,"in the morning, and now here was mamma going too, and Kitty would be"
124,LITTLE MOTHER.,left to play lady of the house as grand as anything.
125,LITTLE MOTHER.,
126,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Well, the carriage was brought to the door, and mamma got in, after"
127,LITTLE MOTHER.,kissing her little family all round about twenty times. Everybody rushed
128,LITTLE MOTHER.,"to the front piazza to bid her good-by in their own fashion. Trip, the"
129,LITTLE MOTHER.,"black dog, jumped and barked around the horses, until they nearly kicked"
130,LITTLE MOTHER.,"him, when he sprang away, snapping out, ""No, you don't! no, you don't!"""
131,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dody, the white kitten, so called by Walter for ""Daisy,"" mewed as hard"
132,LITTLE MOTHER.,"as she could from Luly's arms. Walter crowed and chuckled, and said,"
133,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Boo-bi!"" meaning good-by; Luly lisped, ""Dood-by, dear mamma, _div_ my"
134,LITTLE MOTHER.,"_yove_ to gan'ma;"" and Kitty said, ""Good-by, mamma; I'll be a famous"
135,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Little Mother--see if I'm not!"" And so the carriage drove away."
136,LITTLE MOTHER.,
137,LITTLE MOTHER.,"When it was quite out of sight, the little girls skipped and climbed,"
138,LITTLE MOTHER.,and wee Walter was carried by nurse up stairs into the nursery; and
139,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Kitty said, ""Now, Mary, you can just go on with your sewing; you needn't"
140,LITTLE MOTHER.,mind us a bit. I'm going to take care of _the children_; mamma said
141,LITTLE MOTHER.,"so."""
142,LITTLE MOTHER.,
143,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Very well, Miss Kitty,"" said Mary; ""I'll sit in the window here, and if"
144,LITTLE MOTHER.,"you want me, you can call."""
145,LITTLE MOTHER.,
146,LITTLE MOTHER.,"So Mary fixed little Walter in his chair, and Luly got hers, and Kitty"
147,LITTLE MOTHER.,"sat down in her mamma's rocking chair, to be grander."
148,LITTLE MOTHER.,
149,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Walter's chair had a little tray fastened before it, on which his toys"
150,LITTLE MOTHER.,"were put. His dearest plaything was a ridiculous old doll, with no eyes,"
151,LITTLE MOTHER.,"half a wig, such a dilapidated pair of kid arms that the stuffing came"
152,LITTLE MOTHER.,"bursting through in every direction, making her look as if she had a"
153,LITTLE MOTHER.,"cotton plantation inside her, and the bolls were sprouting out; and such"
154,LITTLE MOTHER.,"an extremely short pair of legs in proportion to her body, that it"
155,LITTLE MOTHER.,seemed as if they must shut into her like a pair of telescopes. Besides
156,LITTLE MOTHER.,"this, there was a stale sugar peacock without a tail, a monkey that ran"
157,LITTLE MOTHER.,"up and down a stick, and a woolly dog that could open his mouth and bark"
158,LITTLE MOTHER.,"when you pressed him underneath; but the doll was the prime favorite,"
159,LITTLE MOTHER.,"after all. Walter called her Gawow, and as nobody in the house could"
160,LITTLE MOTHER.,"imagine what he meant by it, it was supposed to be a pure piece of"
161,LITTLE MOTHER.,"invention, and a very fine sort of thing."
162,LITTLE MOTHER.,
163,LITTLE MOTHER.,"The children played on peaceably together for some time, when all at"
164,LITTLE MOTHER.,once there came a ring at the bell.
165,LITTLE MOTHER.,
166,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Dear me!"" cried Kitty, springing up and smoothing down her little"
167,LITTLE MOTHER.,"black silk apron in a great flurry. ""There comes company, and I'm to go"
168,LITTLE MOTHER.,"and see them."""
169,LITTLE MOTHER.,
170,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Ou!"" said Luly; ""me want to see tompany too!"""
171,LITTLE MOTHER.,
172,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""And so you shall, you little darling!"" said Kitty, kissing her; and,"
173,LITTLE MOTHER.,"sure enough, up came Ellen, the waiter, to say that the good minister,"
174,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Mr. Lacy, was down stairs; for Mrs. May had smilingly told her, before"
175,LITTLE MOTHER.,"she went, that ""Miss Kitty would see any one who called."""
176,LITTLE MOTHER.,
177,LITTLE MOTHER.,"In high glee, yet somewhat awed by her grown-up dignity, Kitty let Mary"
178,LITTLE MOTHER.,brush her soft brown braided wig and Luly's golden curly one; then she
179,LITTLE MOTHER.,"rushed into her mother's room in a hurry, called Luly out into the"
180,LITTLE MOTHER.,"entry, and the little sisters took hold of hands and went down stairs to"
181,LITTLE MOTHER.,see the company.
182,LITTLE MOTHER.,
183,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Mr. Lacy was sitting by the window, looking out on the beautiful garden,"
184,LITTLE MOTHER.,and did not know the children had entered until he felt a mite of a hand
185,LITTLE MOTHER.,"put softly on his, and heard two little pipy voices saying, ""How do you"
186,LITTLE MOTHER.,"do, Mr. Lacy?"" The minister turned round and burst right out laughing!"
187,LITTLE MOTHER.,"for Kitty, when she ran into her mother's room, had put on--what do you"
188,LITTLE MOTHER.,"think?--why, one of mamma's caps, which was lying on the dressing table!"
189,LITTLE MOTHER.,and the queer little thing looked so funny with the lace cap perched on
190,LITTLE MOTHER.,"top of her head, that Mr. Lacy laughed heartily, and said, ""Why, Kitty!"
191,LITTLE MOTHER.,are you the old woman that lived in a shoe? or have you got bald all of
192,LITTLE MOTHER.,"a sudden, that you have taken to caps?"""
193,LITTLE MOTHER.,
194,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Oh, I'm Little Mother!"" said Kitty; ""mamma has gone to the city, and"
195,LITTLE MOTHER.,"left me to take care of _the children_, and the house, and Dody, and"
196,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Trip, until she comes back; and I'm Little Mother to all of them."""
197,LITTLE MOTHER.,
198,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Well, Little Mother,"" said Mr. Lacy, who was none of your cross,"
199,LITTLE MOTHER.,"crabbed old ministers, with faces as sour as vinegar, and voices as"
200,LITTLE MOTHER.,"sharp as a needle, who frighten children half out of their wits,"
201,LITTLE MOTHER.,"forgetful that ""of such is the kingdom of heaven;"" ""I hope your children"
202,LITTLE MOTHER.,"will be well brought up, and learn all they should. What does this one"
203,LITTLE MOTHER.,"know?"" lifting Luly to his knee."
204,LITTLE MOTHER.,
205,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I know 'ittle hymn,"" said Luly, smiling up confidently in his face."
206,LITTLE MOTHER.,
207,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Can't you say it for me?"" asked the minister. ""What is it all about?"""
208,LITTLE MOTHER.,
209,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""'Bout 'at a 'ittle child can do,"" lisped Luly."
210,LITTLE MOTHER.,
211,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Say it, Luly,"" said Kitty."
212,LITTLE MOTHER.,
213,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Luly folded her cunning fat hands over each other, and crossed her feet."
214,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Then she looked up sideways in Mr. Lacy's face, and sucked her tongue a"
215,LITTLE MOTHER.,"little bit, and at last, all at once, in a little singing voice, she"
216,LITTLE MOTHER.,began:
217,LITTLE MOTHER.,
218,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I'm a very 'ittle maid;"
219,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Hardly can I talk, 'tis true;"
220,LITTLE MOTHER.,Yet mamma I'd love to aid--
221,LITTLE MOTHER.,What can 'ittle Luly do?
222,LITTLE MOTHER.,
223,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I can go, on busy feet,"
224,LITTLE MOTHER.,Errands for her all day through;
225,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Work for her, I feel, is sweet--"
226,LITTLE MOTHER.,This can 'ittle Luly do!
227,LITTLE MOTHER.,
228,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I can hold the gate long skein"
229,LITTLE MOTHER.,When 'tis tangled and askew;
230,LITTLE MOTHER.,Never wanting to _compain_[A]--
231,LITTLE MOTHER.,This can 'ittle Luly do!
232,LITTLE MOTHER.,
233,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I can search, her book to find,"
234,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And be _glad_ to do it, too!"
235,LITTLE MOTHER.,I can always _quickly mind_--
236,LITTLE MOTHER.,This can 'ittle Luly do!
237,LITTLE MOTHER.,
238,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I can ever go up stairs"
239,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Cheerfully, when falls the dew;"
240,LITTLE MOTHER.,And with _yev'yence_[B] say my prayers--
241,LITTLE MOTHER.,This can 'ittle Luly do!
242,LITTLE MOTHER.,
243,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""GOD will help me, if I try;"
244,LITTLE MOTHER.,He good children loves to view;
245,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dear Lord Jesus, from on high,"
246,LITTLE MOTHER.,"_Pease_ tell Luly what to do!"""
247,LITTLE MOTHER.,
248,LITTLE MOTHER.,
249,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Ah! that is a beautiful hymn,"" said the good minister. ""Don't you know"
250,LITTLE MOTHER.,"any, Little Mother?"""
251,LITTLE MOTHER.,
252,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""I am learning a beautiful hymn,"" said Kitty, ""but I don't know it"
253,LITTLE MOTHER.,"yet--not quite."""
254,LITTLE MOTHER.,
255,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""No?"" said Mr. Lacy. ""Then I shall have to tell you something myself, I"
256,LITTLE MOTHER.,"declare. Here, sit down beside me, and listen very attentively."""
257,LITTLE MOTHER.,
258,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Now, what do you think the minister told them? ""Some dreadful, dismal"
259,LITTLE MOTHER.,"story, full of dreadful, wicked children, who were sent to prison, I"
260,LITTLE MOTHER.,"suppose; or an account of how, if _they_ ever dared to run down stairs,"
261,LITTLE MOTHER.,"or look out of the window, or sneeze in church, on Sundays, they never"
262,LITTLE MOTHER.,"would get to Heaven!"" perhaps you will say. Not a bit of it. He just"
263,LITTLE MOTHER.,"trotted Luly up and down on his knee, and told them these funny verses:"
264,LITTLE MOTHER.,
265,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Three little kittens from home ran away,"
266,LITTLE MOTHER.,Oh dear! oh dear!
267,LITTLE MOTHER.,And did you not hear
268,LITTLE MOTHER.,All that befell them on that day?
269,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly--"
270,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Did you ever hear, in your life, of such folly!"
271,LITTLE MOTHER.,
272,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Out they ran from their mother's door,"
273,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And skipped, and tripped,"
274,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And danced, and dipped,"
275,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Way down the road, where they'd ne'er been before!"
276,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly,"
277,LITTLE MOTHER.,Oh deary! what _will_ be the end of their folly?
278,LITTLE MOTHER.,
279,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""'Come let us go into this barn for mice!'"
280,LITTLE MOTHER.,'Oh don't!' 'Oh stuff!
281,LITTLE MOTHER.,I'm hungry enough
282,LITTLE MOTHER.,To eat anything that is sav'ry and nice!'
283,LITTLE MOTHER.,"So quoth little Dolly and Poppledy-polly,"
284,LITTLE MOTHER.,"While Dilly looked on, quite aghast at their folly!"
285,LITTLE MOTHER.,
286,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""So in it they went, quite full of their fun,"
287,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And stared, and glared,"
288,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And meauoed, and scared"
289,LITTLE MOTHER.,The poor little mice till they made them all run!
290,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly;"
291,LITTLE MOTHER.,"For Dilly, I'm sorry to say, shared their folly."
292,LITTLE MOTHER.,
293,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""But, alas! while the kittens were hunting up mice,"
294,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And munching, and crunching"
295,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Their smoking-hot _lunching_,"
296,LITTLE MOTHER.,A boy came and caught them all up in a trice!
297,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly;"
298,LITTLE MOTHER.,_Oh!_ OH! OH! what a shocking cli_max_ to their folly!
299,LITTLE MOTHER.,
300,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Oh, how they struggled and mewed in their fright!"
301,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And scratched, and snatched"
302,LITTLE MOTHER.,At the dismal old patched
303,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Bag they were thrust into, twisted up tight!"
304,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly;"
305,LITTLE MOTHER.,"I warrant, they felt bad enough for their folly."
306,LITTLE MOTHER.,
307,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Soon to a stranger house they came;"
308,LITTLE MOTHER.,"'Oh, ma'! oh, ma'!"
309,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Now, only see _thar_!'"
310,LITTLE MOTHER.,Their captor cried out to an elderly dame;
311,LITTLE MOTHER.,"While Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly"
312,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Pricked up their ears, and lamented their folly."
313,LITTLE MOTHER.,
314,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""'What, have you brought in a parcel of cats?"
315,LITTLE MOTHER.,Go straight to the pond
316,LITTLE MOTHER.,And get 'em all drowned!!
317,LITTLE MOTHER.,"I won't have them here, I can tell you; now s'cats!'"
318,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Poor Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly"
319,LITTLE MOTHER.,Set up a loud howl of distress at their folly!
320,LITTLE MOTHER.,
321,LITTLE MOTHER.,"""Off scampered the boy till he came to the bank"
322,LITTLE MOTHER.,Of a very deep pool;
323,LITTLE MOTHER.,"Oh, wasn't it _cruel_!"
324,LITTLE MOTHER.,And tossed in the bag!! To the bottom it sank!!!
325,LITTLE MOTHER.,"With Dilly (oh!), and Dolly (oh!), and Poppledy-polly (oh! oh!),"
326,LITTLE MOTHER.,"And that was the end of their fun and their folly!"""
327,LITTLE MOTHER.,
328,LITTLE MOTHER.,
329,MORAL.,MORAL.
330,MORAL.,
331,MORAL.,"""So, children, I solemnly beg and implore,"
332,MORAL.,"Whatever you do,"
333,MORAL.,"(And you're torments a _few_,)"
334,MORAL.,You'll never slip out of your dear mother's door;
335,MORAL.,"Or, like Dilly, and Dolly, and Poppledy-polly,"
336,MORAL.,"You'll surely be made to repent of your folly!"""
337,MORAL.,
338,MORAL.,"The children were very much amused with this woful history, bursting out"
339,MORAL.,"laughing without any kind of fail when Poppledy-polly, of comical memory"
340,MORAL.,"and name, was mentioned. Luly said, ""Oh, me _yike_ that name! me want to"
341,MORAL.,"call Dody Popply-polly."" This made Kitty laugh more than ever, and they"
342,MORAL.,"had a great time chasing Dody round the hall, and catching her, to bawl"
343,MORAL.,"in her ears ""Poppledy-polly!"" by way of kindly informing her that was to"
344,MORAL.,be her new name.
345,MORAL.,
346,MORAL.,"Dody didn't seem to like it much, for she jumped out of Luly's arms with"
347,MORAL.,"a squeal and a flourish of her long tail, and scampered off faster than"
348,MORAL.,"ever each time. After watching them, and laughing for a while, Mr. Lacy"
349,MORAL.,"rose to go, saying:"
350,MORAL.,
351,MORAL.,"""Good-by, Little Mother; I must go and see some of the big mothers now."
352,MORAL.,"Don't forget me on any account, and tell your mamma, when she comes"
353,MORAL.,"home, that I approve your style of housekeeping very much indeed."""
354,MORAL.,
355,MORAL.,"""Good-by, Mr. Lacy,"" said Kitty. ""Thank you for your funny story."""
356,MORAL.,
357,MORAL.,"""Tank 'ou--funny 'tory!"" repeated Luly after her sister."
358,MORAL.,
359,MORAL.,"Mr. Lacy lifted the little thing up to his shoulder, and held her there"
360,MORAL.,"a minute, saying, ""Good-by, Poppledy-polly! I hope, when I come again,"
361,MORAL.,"you will know another hymn to say."""
362,MORAL.,
363,MORAL.,"Luly didn't like much to be called Poppledy-polly, and she said, with"
364,MORAL.,"an air of considerable displeasure, ""My name Luly May;"" but when the"
365,MORAL.,"minister kissed her, and called her ""his little lamb,"" she relented, and"
366,MORAL.,"cooed, ""Me _yove_ 'ou, miniter!'"
367,MORAL.,
368,MORAL.,Then something quite sorrowful happened; for two great tears gathered in
369,MORAL.,"the minister's eyes, and came slowly rolling down his kind face. Ah! he"
370,MORAL.,"thought of his own little pet lamb, who once lisped, too, ""Me yove 'ou;"""
371,MORAL.,who said so now to the dear Jesus; and with that last thought came
372,MORAL.,"comfort. Floy was only ""sleeping""--and setting little Luly gently down,"
373,MORAL.,"Mr. Lacy laid a hand on each childish head, saying, ""God bless you, my"
374,MORAL.,"little lambs,"" and went quietly away. The children watched him drive"
375,MORAL.,"off, and then capturing Dody once more--by the end of her tail this"
376,MORAL.,time--Kitty popped her in her apron; and lugged her up stairs in
377,MORAL.,triumph.
378,MORAL.,
379,MORAL.,"There they found Wawa, sitting on the floor, with an immense pair of"
380,MORAL.,"scissors held in both hands, and an expression of extreme horror on his"
381,MORAL.,"face. Mary had left the room, and Kitty, running up to her baby brother,"
382,MORAL.,"pulled away the scissors in a great fright, exclaiming, ""Why, Wawa!"
383,MORAL.,"where did you get those?"""
384,MORAL.,
385,MORAL.,"Wawa stared astonished for a moment, his great blue eyes opened very"
386,MORAL.,"wide indeed; then he bubbled out, ""On yer fore (floor); yook! Gawow all"
387,MORAL.,"poil!"" (spoiled); and poor Wawa puckered up his little rosy mouth,"
388,MORAL.,and began to cry most piteously.
389,MORAL.,
390,MORAL.,[Illustration: KITTY POPPED HER INTO HER APRON]
391,MORAL.,
392,MORAL.,"Luly popped on the floor beside him in a minute, and pulling his curly"
393,MORAL.,"head down on her breast, she murmured, ""There--don't _c'y_, never"
394,MORAL.,"_matter_, dear _bedder_--s'eel get well!"" while Kitty lifted up poor"
395,MORAL.,"Gawow, who was indeed in a pitiable condition. Walter had ornamented her"
396,MORAL.,"face with several deep digs of the scissors, which made her look as if"
397,MORAL.,she had been to the wars and come home with a number of bullet holes in
398,MORAL.,"her. Then, not satisfied with this--what does that monkey Wawa do but"
399,MORAL.,"rip up her whole body from the neck to the waist, and shake out every"
400,MORAL.,bit of the bran all over the carpet! leaving the wretched Gawow with
401,MORAL.,not the least particle of insides.
402,MORAL.,
403,MORAL.,Did you ever hear of such a piece of mischief? But then Walter was such
404,MORAL.,a little fellow--not quite two years old; of course he didn't mean to do
405,MORAL.,"anything wrong, and nobody thought of blaming him; so Kitty called Mary"
406,MORAL.,"to come and sweep up the bran, and Luly and Walter were soon happily"
407,MORAL.,"engaged in stuffing Gawow with rags, making her look as good as new--or"
408,MORAL.,"as good as old, I might say; for she was such a direful object in the"
409,MORAL.,"first place, that it seemed as though she must have been bought in that"
410,MORAL.,"condition, and never could have been otherwise; after which they"
411,MORAL.,"dressed her in her very best bonnet and frock, and treated her to a nice"
412,MORAL.,"dance in the garden, all taking hold of hands; until Mary looked out of"
413,MORAL.,the window and called them to come up to dinner.
414,MORAL.,
415,MORAL.,"Kitty was old enough, now, to dine with the grown folks, and behaved"
416,MORAL.,"like a perfect little lady, too; but on this occasion she was going to"
417,MORAL.,take early dinner in the nursery.
418,MORAL.,
419,MORAL.,"She and Luly helped Mary pull out the nursery table, and set the three"
420,MORAL.,"little plates upon it. Walter's dinner was some mashed potato, with just"
421,MORAL.,"a tiny mite of chicken among it, minced very fine, and made into an"
422,MORAL.,"elegant hill on his plate, and a ""wishing bone"" to suck. Luly had the"
423,MORAL.,"same, only with more chicken; and Kitty cut up her own wing and slice of"
424,MORAL.,"breast, with her particular knife and fork, as nice as you please."
425,MORAL.,
426,MORAL.,"There was a great deal of merriment over the dinner, when Walter would"
427,MORAL.,"look away just as Mary gave him a spoonful of potato, watching her out"
428,MORAL.,"of the corner of his eye, though, and then bob round again and say"
429,MORAL.,"""Feed!"" just as she had put it down, thinking he didn't want any more."
430,MORAL.,"Then he insisted on making Gawow taste the wishing bone, and poked it"
431,MORAL.,"into both her eyes in succession, as if that was the usual way for"
432,MORAL.,"people to eat things. After they had finished the chicken and potato,"
433,MORAL.,"they had some nice custard pudding; and when dinner was over, Kitty"
434,MORAL.,"went right to the wash stand and _cleaned her teeth_, while Luly held up"
435,MORAL.,her mouth to have Mary brush her little pearly teeth. Do you always do
436,MORAL.,"this, little reader? If not, let me beg you to begin right away. Are"
437,MORAL.,"they done now? Very well, then let us go on with the story."
438,MORAL.,
439,MORAL.,"Pretty soon after, the children were dressed to go out walking; for it"
440,MORAL.,"was in the early spring time when all this happened, and still pleasant,"
441,MORAL.,"in the cold country, to take the middle of the day for going out. So"
442,MORAL.,"Kitty and Luly had their little blue poplin ""coat-dresses"" buttoned on,"
443,MORAL.,"and the soft white woollen hoods tied under their rosy faces, and Walter"
444,MORAL.,was decked out in _his_ new blue coat; which pleased him so much that
445,MORAL.,he distinguished himself immediately afterward by walking all alone away
446,MORAL.,"from the door to the window, quite across the room, and there sitting"
447,MORAL.,"down suddenly on the floor, much to his astonishment. At last they were"
448,MORAL.,"all ready and started off, Kitty and Luly hand in hand, and Walter in"
449,MORAL.,his little carriage.
450,MORAL.,
451,MORAL.,"The road they liked best led along the top of a high bank, and was"
452,MORAL.,"called ""Buena Vista"" terrace. There were very pretty houses built along"
453,MORAL.,"here, shaded by tall trees; and if the children peeped cautiously over"
454,MORAL.,"the iron fence that guarded the edge of the bank, they could sometimes"
455,MORAL.,see the steam cars rushing along the shore below. They were very fond
456,MORAL.,"of watching the hurrying train go by, though it frightened them a"
457,MORAL.,"little, particularly when the engine gave a shrill scream before"
458,MORAL.,stopping at the station about a quarter of a mile further on. Kitty and
459,MORAL.,"Luly couldn't help squealing too when that happened, and then laughing"
460,MORAL.,"very much, and scampering on, playing they were steam engines."
461,MORAL.,
462,MORAL.,"Just as they were passing by the prettiest house on the terrace, out"
463,MORAL.,"came a young lady that Kitty and Luly knew and loved dearly, with a"
464,MORAL.,"""tremendous dog"" stalking slowly after her."
465,MORAL.,
466,MORAL.,"""Why, Kitty!"" she cried, ""is that you? Nurse, do bring the children in."
467,MORAL.,"I want to see them so much!"""
468,MORAL.,
469,MORAL.,"So Mary went to open the gate; but before she could do so, up marched"
470,MORAL.,"Buffo, the ""tremendous dog,"" and lifted the latch with his nose! Oh, how"
471,MORAL.,Kitty and Luly did laugh and clap their hands! but their enjoyment and
472,MORAL.,"surprise were at full height when the kind young lady, whom they called"
473,MORAL.,"Miss Ella, lifted Luly, and Mary held Wawa, on Buffo's shaggy back, and"
474,MORAL.,the good fellow carried them both safely to the house. Wawa crowed and
475,MORAL.,"laughed, and drummed with his heels against the side of his charger; but"
476,MORAL.,"the brave dog never tried to shake him off, and just walked gravely"
477,MORAL.,"along, looking as trustworthy as possible. Then, when the little"
478,MORAL.,"children got off, Kitty mounted somewhat fearfully on Buffo's broad"
479,MORAL.,"back, and rode all around the grass plot, laughing with delight."
480,MORAL.,
481,MORAL.,"After that, Miss Ella made them sit down in a great rocking chair on the"
482,MORAL.,"porch, wide enough for all three to get in at once, and asked them what"
483,MORAL.,they had been doing that morning; and then Kitty told about her being
484,MORAL.,"Little Mother, and Luly said, so funny, ""Miniter tome see Luly and"
485,MORAL.,"Kitty, and tell funny 'tory 'bout Dilly, and Dolly, and Popply-polly;"
486,MORAL.,"and 'en--and 'en I talled Dody Popply-polly, and s'e wan away!"""
487,MORAL.,
488,MORAL.,"That amused Miss Ella very much, and pretty soon she opened her"
489,MORAL.,"work-box, took out a paper of lemon drops, and gave Luly, and Kitty,"
490,MORAL.,"and Wawa each a handful. Luly was a generous little puss, and wanted"
491,MORAL.,"every one to share her ""goodies;"" so she even offered a lemon drop to"
492,MORAL.,"Buffo, when, what do you think the great black fellow did? He just put"
493,MORAL.,"his great fore paws on Luly's lap, opened his wide red mouth, and eat up"
494,MORAL.,every one of the drops at a mouthful!
495,MORAL.,
496,MORAL.,"Poor Luly opened _her_ mouth in rueful astonishment, and looked very"
497,MORAL.,much as if she was going to burst out crying; but Miss Ella consoled her
498,MORAL.,"by giving her some more drops, and Wawa thrust one of his into her"
499,MORAL.,"mouth, saying, ""Dog eat Luly's d'ops; Wawa torry."""
500,MORAL.,
501,MORAL.,So they talked away till it was time to go; and then Miss Ella kissed
502,MORAL.,"her little visitors; and Buffo wanted to kiss them too, with his warm"
503,MORAL.,red tongue; but Luly took good care to be out of the way this time. I
504,MORAL.,expect the little thing thought he would eat her up like a lemon drop;
505,MORAL.,so Kitty let him lick her hand instead; and then Buffo let Miss Ella put
506,MORAL.,"Luly and Wawa on his back again, and rode them down to the gate, where"
507,MORAL.,they bid good-by to their kind friend.
508,MORAL.,
509,MORAL.,"Tea was ready for them when they came back, and ""when fell the dew"" Luly"
510,MORAL.,"and Kitty went ""cheerfully up stairs"" to bed. And now a sweet, serious"
511,MORAL.,"expression came over Little Mother's face, and her great brown eyes were"
512,MORAL.,"filled with loving reverence, as Luly, in her little white night gown,"
513,MORAL.,"bent her golden curls on the lap of her sister, and lisped out ""Now I"
514,MORAL.,"_yay_ me down to s'eep""--that dear, precious little verse that I think"
515,MORAL.,"all the children in the world must say; and prayed ""Dear Jesus"" to"
516,MORAL.,"""b'ess papa and mamma, and dear sister, and 'ittle bedder, and mate Luly"
517,MORAL.,"dood 'ittle child;"" and as Little Mother's lips were murmuring those"
518,MORAL.,"words after her, the door opened, and there stood her own dear mamma and"
519,MORAL.,"papa, just home from the city; and oh! I can't tell you half how much"
520,MORAL.,they loved their darling ones when they saw that sweet little scene.
521,MORAL.,
522,MORAL.,"And then there was a merry frolic with papa, who rode Luly and Wawa on"
523,MORAL.,"both shoulders as well as Buffo did; and a happy time with dear mamma,"
524,MORAL.,"who brought them three great oranges from grandma', and ever so many"
525,MORAL.,"kisses for her share; and a holy, blessed time when that dear mamma"
526,MORAL.,"knelt by her precious Kitty's bedside, and prayed God to bless and keep"
527,MORAL.,
528,LITTLE MOTHER.,LITTLE MOTHER.

539,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.
540,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
541,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
542,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,OF all the sweet little ten-year old maidens that ever laughed and
543,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"danced through their happy lives, I don't suppose one had such a"
544,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"wonderful doll's house, or such a fine family of dolls, as Lina. Let me"
545,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,describe the family and their residence.
546,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
547,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"In one of the upper rooms of Lina's house you would see, if you happened"
548,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"to walk in, another whole house built. It is two stories high: its front"
549,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"is red brick; and a flight of brown stone steps, made of sand-paper"
550,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"glued over wood, leads up to the entrance. It has real sashes in the"
551,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"windows, which open French fashion; a silver door-plate, with the name"
552,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"of ""Montague"" upon it; and a little mat, about as large as a half"
553,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"dollar, on the upper step! If we could make ourselves as small as dolls,"
554,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"we might walk in, and find out that the hall has a dark wood floor, some"
555,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"cunning little pictures hanging on the wall, a noble black walnut"
556,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"staircase, and is lighted with a real little hall lamp."
557,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
558,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"The parlor, on one side of this hall, has a velvet carpet on the floor,"
559,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"satin chairs and sofas, a centre table covered with tiny books, an"
560,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"étagere full of ornaments, and a wicker-work flower stand filled with"
561,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"flowers. Real little mantel and pier glasses are over the fire place,"
562,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and between the front windows, which are hung with elegant lace"
563,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"curtains; and there is, besides, a piano-forte, a gold chandelier stuck"
564,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"full of china wax-candles, and a little clock that can wind up--though"
565,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"as to its going, that has to be imagined, for it obstinately represents"
566,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the time as a quarter to twelve, morning, noon, and night!"
567,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
568,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,On the opposite side of the hall is the dining-room. It is furnished
569,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"with a fine side-board, holding a silver tea-set and some tiny glass"
570,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"goblets and decanters; a round table, which is abominably disorderly, it"
571,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"must be confessed, being spread with a table cloth all awry, and covered"
572,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,with a grand dinner of wooden chickens and vegetables of various sorts;
573,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"a mould of yellow-glass jelly, and a pair of fancy fruit dishes, made of"
574,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"cream candy. The dining-room chairs, with real leather seats, are"
575,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"scattered about, and there is even the daily newspaper thrown down on"
576,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the floor, where the master of the house may have left it! Up stairs"
577,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"there are three bedrooms, furnished in the same fashionable style; and,"
578,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"in short, such an elegant doll's house is not to be found anywhere but"
579,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,in a French toy shop. This one was brought from Paris by Lina's elder
580,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"brother, and set up in this very room last Christmas as a surprise for"
581,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,his dear little sister. But it is time I should describe the family who
582,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"lived in this elegant mansion. So, little reader, if you will only take"
583,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"fast hold of the end of the author's pen, shut up your eyes tight, and"
584,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"then open them very quick on this page, heigh! presto! you and she will"
585,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"be turned into little personages just the size of dolls, able to walk up"
586,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the brown stone steps, enter the house, and take a peep at the Montague"
587,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,family.
588,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
589,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"On a lounge by the parlor fire sits an elegant lady, who is rather"
590,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"skimpy about the wig, and therefore holds the honorable post of mamma to"
591,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the family; as this circumstance, combined with her looking excessively"
592,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"inky about the nose, gives her a somewhat aged and anxious appearance."
593,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"She wears a blue silk dress with five flounces, a lace cap, and a watch"
594,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and chain; and her name is Mrs. Charles Augustus Montague. Her husband,"
595,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"_Mr._ Charles Augustus, is a china doll with a crop of rather scrubby"
596,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"flaxen hair, which can be combed and brushed as much as Lina chooses."
597,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Although he is so rich, he has only one suit of clothes, and must even"
598,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"go to parties in a pair of checked gingham trowsers, a red vest, and a"
599,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"blue coat with brass buttons! He is supposed to be down town at present,"
600,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,which circumstance is represented by his being unceremoniously thrust
601,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,into a corner upside down.
602,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
603,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,Several smaller wax and china boys and girls represent the family of the
604,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,ill-used Mr. Montague; but the belle of the whole doll-community is his
605,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"eldest daughter, Miss Isabella Belmont Montague. She is a waxen young"
606,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,lady of the most splendid description; her hair is arranged like the
607,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"empress', whom, indeed, she greatly resembles; her feet and hands are of"
608,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"wax, and she has more dresses than I can possibly count. I am afraid you"
609,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"will scarcely believe me, but she actually has a real little ermine muff"
610,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and tippet, a pair of india-rubbers, an umbrella, a camels' hair shawl,"
611,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and _real corsets_! and was won, with all her wardrobe, at one of the"
612,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"raffles in the great Union Bazaar. You went there, didn't you--you"
613,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"cunning little kitten? and saw all the dolls? I hope you got one too, so"
614,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"I do, certainly!"
615,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
616,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,[Illustration: LINA MAKING DOLLS' CLOTHES.]
617,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
618,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Besides the Montague family, there is a numerous colony of other dolls;"
619,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"but they, poor things, live in any corner where Lina chooses to put"
620,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"them; and all day Sunday are shut up in a dark closet, with nothing to"
621,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"do but count their fingers and toes, if they can contrive to see them;"
622,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"though they have nearly as fine a wardrobe--for Lina's great amusement,"
623,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"next to playing with the whole colony, is to make new dresses for them."
624,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
625,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"One Saturday afternoon, Lina was playing with her dolls in the baby"
626,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"house, with two of her little neighbors, Minnie and Maggie Elliott, to"
627,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"keep her company. It was a dark, rainy sort of day; but what difference"
628,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,did that make to the children? _They_ never wanted to make a parcel of
629,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"stupid morning calls, or go out shopping and spend all their money on"
630,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"silly finery; no--they were full of their play in the house, and didn't"
631,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,care a doll's shoe-string how hard it rained.
632,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
633,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""Oh, dear!"" said Lina at last; ""seems to me this play is getting very"
634,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,stupid! I wish we knew something else to play at but everlasting
635,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"'house!'"""
636,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
637,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""I'll tell you what would be great fun!"" said little Minnie, looking"
638,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"wise. ""You know, Lina, we spent a week once in the country with 'Alice"
639,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Nightcaps;' and her sister, 'Aunt Fanny's' daughter, showed us such a"
640,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"nice, funny play! Instead of our being mothers, and aunts, and fathers,"
641,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and the dolls our children, the dolls were all the people themselves,"
642,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"and we moved them about and spoke for them."""
643,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
644,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""Yes, it was such a nice plan!"" said Maggie; ""you can't think, Lina."
645,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Suppose we divide these dolls into families, and play that Miss Isabella"
646,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Belmont Montague was going to be married, and all about it."""
647,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
648,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""Oh, yes! yes! that will be splendid!"" cried Lina. ""Whom will you"
649,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"manage, Maggie?"""
650,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
651,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""I'd rather have Miss Isabella,"" said Maggie."
652,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
653,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""And I want Mr. Morris,"" said Minnie. ""He shall be the lover."""
654,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
655,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""Very well, then I'll make the father and mother talk,"" said Lina,"
656,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"generously taking the less splendid dolls, without a word of mean"
657,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"complaint, such as ""There, you hateful thing, you always want the best;"""
658,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"or, ""I _do_ wish I could do as I like with _my own_ dolls!"" forgetting"
659,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,that company must be allowed to take the best always. The other dolls
660,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"were equally divided between the children, and then Lina exclaimed, with"
661,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"a delighted little skip in the air, ""Now, we are all ready to begin!"
662,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Come, girls, what time shall it be?"""
663,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
664,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"""Oh, have them at breakfast!"" chimed both the little visitors; and so,"
665,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"in defiance of the parlor clock, the time of day was supposed to be"
666,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"eight in the morning. The children, with many little chuckling pauses,"
667,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"while they considered what to do next, twitched the unlucky table cloth"
668,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"straight, put the tea-set on the table, and gave the family a wooden"
669,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"beefsteak for breakfast, and a large plateful of wooden buttered toast,"
670,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,which came from a box full of such indigestible dainties. Then they
671,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"fished Mr. Charles Augustus Montague out of the corner, and set him"
672,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"upright in a chair at the head of the table, with his newspaper fastened"
673,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"in his hands, by having a couple of large pins stuck through it and"
674,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"them. The points of the pins showed on the other side, and looked as if"
675,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,he had a few extra finger nails growing on the backs of his hands. Quite
676,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"a curiosity he'd have been for Barnum's Museum, wouldn't he? you"
677,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,precious little old toad.
678,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
679,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Mrs. Montague was seated behind the tea-tray, and Miss Isabella was"
680,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"reclining on a sofa up stairs, as if she was too lazy to come down when"
681,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,the rest of the family did. As the front door was only large enough for
682,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the dolls, the whole back of the house came away. Lina and her visitors"
683,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"delightedly sat down cross-legged on the floor behind it, and the play"
684,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"began, the children talking for the dolls."
685,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
686,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,*       *       *       *       *
687,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
688,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,MRS. MONTAGUE. (Lina speaks for her in a fine voice.) I wish you would
689,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"lay down your paper a moment, Charles; I want to speak to you."
690,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
691,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. M. Well, my dear, I am listening."
692,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
693,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. No, you are not; put down the paper! [As this couldn't very well"
694,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"be done by the gentleman himself, Maggie twitched it away for him, and"
695,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,threw it under the table.]
696,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
697,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. Now, Charles, I must say I think it is high time Isabella was"
698,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"married. She is most six months old, I declare! and it strikes me we had"
699,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,better see if we can find her a husband.
700,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
701,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. M. What you say is very sensible, my dear; so I will call to-day on"
702,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"my friend Mr. Morris, and invite him to dinner. Perhaps they will fall"
703,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,in love with each other.
704,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
705,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. Oh! but is he handsome, Mr. Montague?"
706,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
707,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. M. Handsome! I should rather think so! Why, he is nearly two feet"
708,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"high, with curly black hair; a nose that can be seen at the side--which"
709,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"is more than yours can be, Mrs. Montague--and eyes which open and shut"
710,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,of themselves when he lies down or sits up. Then he is a Seventh
711,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Regimenter, too, and always wears his uniform; which makes him look very"
712,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,genteel.
713,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
714,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. Oh, I am sure he must be lovely! Do bring him to dinner this"
715,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,very day.
716,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
717,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Here Maggie made the dining-room door open, and in walked Miss Isabella."
718,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"She wore a pink merino morning dress, open in front, to show her"
719,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"embroidered petticoat, a pair of bronze slippers with pink bows, and a"
720,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,net with steel beads in it. Maggie set her down hard in one of the
721,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"chairs, and pushed her up to the table; while Minnie, who moved the"
722,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"nigger boy doll, who waited on table, picked him up by his woolly"
723,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"top-knot, from the floor, where he had tumbled, and made him hand the"
724,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,young lady a cup of tea. Then Maggie began:
725,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
726,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MISS ISABELLA. Dear me, mamma! this tea's as cold as a stone! I wish you"
727,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,would have breakfast a little later; as I'm so tired when I come home
728,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"from a party, that I can't think of getting up at seven o'clock."
729,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
730,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. But you must get up, my love. Besides, we want plenty of time"
731,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"to-day, so's we can be ready; for we are going to have company to"
732,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,dinner.
733,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
734,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"ISABELLA. Who is coming, mamma?"
735,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
736,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. Mr. Morris, my dear."
737,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
738,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"ISABELLA. Oh, I am so glad!"
739,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
740,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. Yes, you're going to be married to-morrow, my dear; we will"
741,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"invite all our relations and friends, and you must have a white satin"
742,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,wedding dress; you certainly must.
743,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
744,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,ISABELLA. How nice! S'pose we go out and buy it now.
745,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
746,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MRS. M. We can't go to-day; it's our _eceptin_ (reception) day, you"
747,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,know.
748,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
749,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. M. Well, I 'spect I must go down town. Good-by, my dears. I shall"
750,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,certainly ask Mr. Morris to dinner. He's a very nice young man for a
751,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,small dinner party.
752,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
753,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,So the children made Mr. Montague kiss his wife and daughter; which they
754,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"did by bumping his china nose against their cheeks, until it nearly made"
755,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"a dent in the wax; and then pranced him down the front steps, and put"
756,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,him in his corner again.
757,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
758,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Then Minnie's doll came in. She took up Mr. Morris, a composition doll,"
759,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"in a Seventh Regiment uniform, who had been bought at a fair, and began"
760,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,moving him across the floor until he was opposite the door. Then she
761,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,commenced talking.
762,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
763,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. MORRIS. Why, I declare! here is Mr. Montague's house. I think I"
764,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,will go in and make a call.
765,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
766,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"And he ran up the steps, and pretended to ring the bell; but as it was"
767,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"only a handle, Lina rang the dinner bell instead."
768,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
769,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,MR. MORRIS. It's very funny they don't answer the bell!
770,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"(Ting-a-ling-ling.) Come! make haste, I want to get in."
771,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
772,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Here Minnie took up Toby, the black boy, carried him to the front door,"
773,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,and kindly opened it for him.
774,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
775,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"TOBY. Laws, massa! is dat you? I was jus' tastin' de jolly, to be sure"
776,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,it was good for dinner! so I couldn't come no sooner.
777,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
778,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,MR. MORRIS. Is Miss Isabella Belmont Montague at home?
779,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
780,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"TOBY. Yes, massa, de ladies is to hum; walk in de parlor."
781,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
782,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"So Mr. Morris came in (with Minnie's hand behind him), and sat down on"
783,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"the sofa. It was rather small for him, and he covered it up so much that"
784,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"there wasn't a bit of room for Miss Isabella, when she came down. Maggie"
785,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"had dressed her meanwhile in her green silk skirt, which had real little"
786,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"three-cornered pockets, with an embroidered pocket handkerchief sticking"
787,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"out of one, and her white tucked waist."
788,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
789,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"Up jumped Mr. Morris, and made her such an elegant bow, that his cap,"
790,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"which he was obliged to keep on all the time, in consequence of the"
791,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"strap being glued fast under his chin, fell all to one side; and looked"
792,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,as if the top of his head had accidentally come off and been stuck on
793,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,crooked.
794,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
795,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. MORRIS. Good morning, Miss Isabella; how do you do?"
796,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
797,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"_Isabella_. Very well, thank you. How do you do, Mr. Morris?"
798,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
799,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"MR. MORRIS. Oh, Miss Isabella, I should be quite well if I hadn't"
800,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,_sitch_ a pain in my heart!
801,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
802,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,"ISABELLA. A pain in your heart! What makes you have that, Mr. Morris?"
803,DOLLS AT HOUSEKEEPING.,
804,MR. MORRIS. YOU!,MR. MORRIS. YOU!
805,MR. MORRIS. YOU!,
806,ISABELLA. I!,ISABELLA. I!
807,ISABELLA. I!,
808,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Oh, Miss Isabella, you can't think how I adore you! I love"
809,ISABELLA. I!,you so much that it makes my eyes shut up when I don't want them to;
810,ISABELLA. I!,and my heart beats so that it shakes my cap all to one side!
811,ISABELLA. I!,
812,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Dear me, Mr. Morris, you are quite _afflitted_! but never"
813,ISABELLA. I!,mind--papa is going to have you to dinner to-day; you'd better go right
814,ISABELLA. I!,"down town, so he can ask you."
815,ISABELLA. I!,
816,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. But I can't eat any dinner, Miss Isabella, without you will"
817,ISABELLA. I!,marry me!
818,ISABELLA. I!,
819,ISABELLA. I!,Here Minnie tried to make Mr. Morris pop down on his knees; but as he
820,ISABELLA. I!,"wasn't a jointed doll, he lost his balance, and tumbled flat on his face"
821,ISABELLA. I!,instead.
822,ISABELLA. I!,
823,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS ISABELLA. Here, what are you doing? get up, do, and stop your"
824,ISABELLA. I!,noise! [For Minnie couldn't help a long-sounding o--h! when her doll
825,ISABELLA. I!,flopped down. So Maggie made the young lady catch hold of Mr. Morris's
826,ISABELLA. I!,"shoulder straps and help twitch him on the sofa again, to go on with his"
827,ISABELLA. I!,proposal.]
828,ISABELLA. I!,
829,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Will you marry me, Miss Isabella? I'm such a nice young"
830,ISABELLA. I!,man--you don't know--and we'll live in a real pretty house.
831,ISABELLA. I!,
832,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS ISABELLA. No, I can't marry you till after you have come to dinner;"
833,ISABELLA. I!,mamma said so.
834,ISABELLA. I!,
835,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Well, then, I must wait; but only say that you will have me."
836,ISABELLA. I!,
837,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Oh, yes!"
838,ISABELLA. I!,
839,ISABELLA. I!,At this point the children laid down the dolls and broke into such a
840,ISABELLA. I!,"merry trill of laughter, that it would have done anybody's heart good to"
841,ISABELLA. I!,hear them. It seemed so funny to have the dolls making love in this
842,ISABELLA. I!,"fashion, they couldn't help it. As soon as they were sober again, the"
843,ISABELLA. I!,play went on thus:
844,ISABELLA. I!,
845,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Well, Miss Isabella, I b'lieve I must go now; I've got an"
846,ISABELLA. I!,"old sister at home, who will scold me if I don't come back. Can't you"
847,ISABELLA. I!,"'vite her too? She has a pretty bad time, poor thing! 'cause she is so"
848,ISABELLA. I!,oldy that she is kept on a shelf till she's all dusty. Her wig is
849,ISABELLA. I!,"dreadful fuzzy, and some of it comes out and stands up at the top. But"
850,ISABELLA. I!,"I'll dust her well and stick a pin in her wig to keep it on, and make"
851,ISABELLA. I!,"her look real nice, if you'll only ask her."
852,ISABELLA. I!,
853,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Well, I guess she can come; but she must have a new dress for"
854,ISABELLA. I!,the wedding.
855,ISABELLA. I!,
856,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Yes, she shall, certainly. Good-by, Miss Isabella. I'm going"
857,ISABELLA. I!,"down town pretty soon, so your father can ask me to come."
858,ISABELLA. I!,
859,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS ISABELLA. Oh yes, do! I want you to come _velly_ much."
860,ISABELLA. I!,
861,ISABELLA. I!,*       *       *       *       *
862,ISABELLA. I!,
863,ISABELLA. I!,"""Now, Maggie, we must stop the play a little while,"" said Lina, ""and fix"
864,ISABELLA. I!,"the dinner for them."""
865,ISABELLA. I!,
866,ISABELLA. I!,"""Yes, do,"" cried Maggie; ""let's see, what shall be for dinner?"""
867,ISABELLA. I!,
868,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, chicken, that's the nicest!"" said Minnie."
869,ISABELLA. I!,
870,ISABELLA. I!,"""No, they had chicken yesterday,"" said Lina; ""let them have roast"
871,ISABELLA. I!,"beef."""
872,ISABELLA. I!,
873,ISABELLA. I!,"""Very well,"" went on Maggie, who was looking over the dishes in the box"
874,ISABELLA. I!,"of ""eatables,"" as Lina called them. ""Roast beef, mashed potatoes, and"
875,ISABELLA. I!,"macaroni."""
876,ISABELLA. I!,
877,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, not macaroni,"" cried Minnie; ""the cheese will bite their tongues."""
878,ISABELLA. I!,
879,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, yes! Mr. Morris likes macaroni,"" said her sister."
880,ISABELLA. I!,
881,ISABELLA. I!,"""Well, macaroni, then; and plum-pudding for dessert--and apples."""
882,ISABELLA. I!,
883,ISABELLA. I!,"""Ah, make them have jelly,"" said Lina; ""that's the prettiest thing in"
884,ISABELLA. I!,"the box."""
885,ISABELLA. I!,
886,ISABELLA. I!,"So the dinner was hunted out, and the three children set the table in"
887,ISABELLA. I!,"fine style; while Toby, the black boy, whose business it certainly was"
888,ISABELLA. I!,"to have done it, sat coolly in Mr. Montague's armchair, with his"
889,ISABELLA. I!,"master's newspaper in his lap, and goggled at the table without moving"
890,ISABELLA. I!,"an inch. Then Lina dressed Mrs. Montague, and Maggie and Minnie together"
891,ISABELLA. I!,"dressed Miss Isabella; and nobody dressed poor Mr. Morris, or Mr."
892,ISABELLA. I!,Charles Augustus Montague; because they unluckily had but one suit a
893,ISABELLA. I!,"piece, sewed fast on to them at that."
894,ISABELLA. I!,
895,ISABELLA. I!,"This time Miss Isabella wore a pink silk frock, with a deep puffing"
896,ISABELLA. I!,"round the bottom, finished at each edge with black velvet. Then she had"
897,ISABELLA. I!,"a long pink sash, edged with two rows of narrow black velvet; a pointed"
898,ISABELLA. I!,"belt encircled her waist, and the body of her dress was a mass of puffs,"
899,ISABELLA. I!,"with narrow black velvet between. On her head was a pink wreath, with"
900,ISABELLA. I!,long ribbon ends hanging down her back; and tied fast to her wrist was a
901,ISABELLA. I!,"pink feather fan with gold sticks. In fact, Miss Isabella looked rather"
902,ISABELLA. I!,as if she were going to a party than coming down to dinner; but the
903,ISABELLA. I!,"children thought the pink silk so charming, that she must wear it,"
904,ISABELLA. I!,whether or no.
905,ISABELLA. I!,
906,ISABELLA. I!,"Mrs. Montague wore a purple silk, a black lace shawl, and a head-dress"
907,ISABELLA. I!,of pink rosebuds and black lace.
908,ISABELLA. I!,
909,ISABELLA. I!,"When the ladies were fairly seated in the parlor, Lina rang the bell,"
910,ISABELLA. I!,"and Minnie and Maggie made Mr. Morris come in, leading his sister by the"
911,ISABELLA. I!,"hand. She was a dismal object to behold, sure enough! and if she could"
912,ISABELLA. I!,"have blushed for herself, I think she certainly would. She wore a green"
913,ISABELLA. I!,"barège dress, trimmed with flaming red ribbons; some of the gathers were"
914,ISABELLA. I!,"out at the waist, and her petticoat showed at the bottom."
915,ISABELLA. I!,
916,ISABELLA. I!,"Mr. Morris, or Minnie--I don't know which--had stuck the ends of her wig"
917,ISABELLA. I!,"down for her once, but they had come up again, and looked as if her hair"
918,ISABELLA. I!,had taken to growing with the roots uppermost. The end of her nose was
919,ISABELLA. I!,"blacker than Mrs. Montague's, and her eyes, which moved with a wire like"
920,ISABELLA. I!,"other wax dolls, had got out of order somehow, and remained stationary,"
921,ISABELLA. I!,"with nothing but the whites showing; and, altogether, poor Miss Morris"
922,ISABELLA. I!,"looked like a two-legged rag-bag come home from the wars, with both"
923,ISABELLA. I!,"eyes out, half a nose, and no hair worth mentioning."
924,ISABELLA. I!,
925,ISABELLA. I!,Lina made Mr. Montague come home as soon as she was rid of the dinner
926,ISABELLA. I!,bell; and after they had all shaken hands until their wax and kid and
927,ISABELLA. I!,"china wrists must have ached, the company rather unceremoniously marched"
928,ISABELLA. I!,right into the dining-room. I suppose Mr. Montague was tremendously
929,ISABELLA. I!,"hungry, and gave his wife's hand a good pinch when he shook it, to make"
930,ISABELLA. I!,"her hurry things up; but, however that may be, they were walked in to"
931,ISABELLA. I!,"dinner in straight order. Mr. Morris sat by Miss Isabella, with his"
932,ISABELLA. I!,"forlorn old sister on the other hand, and as the opposite side of the"
933,ISABELLA. I!,"table looked rather bare, Minnie proposed that some of the children"
934,ISABELLA. I!,should come down to fill up.
935,ISABELLA. I!,
936,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, yes--and let them be dreadfully naughty and do all sorts of"
937,ISABELLA. I!,"mischief,"" said Maggie. So Miss Angelina Seraphina Montague, and Master"
938,ISABELLA. I!,"Algernon Pop-eyes Montague (so called because he had glass eyes, which"
939,ISABELLA. I!,"stuck out in a lobster-ish fashion), were sent for in a hurry and"
940,ISABELLA. I!,"brought down by their nurse, a beautiful doll dressed as a French bonne,"
941,ISABELLA. I!,"and Maggie. Algernon wore the costume of a sailor boy, and Angelina was"
942,ISABELLA. I!,"no other than a nun in a black robe! But never mind, they did very well"
943,ISABELLA. I!,"to fill up, and sat smirking at the company very genteelly."
944,ISABELLA. I!,
945,ISABELLA. I!,"So, then, Lina made Mr. Montague begin."
946,ISABELLA. I!,
947,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MONT. Will you take some roast beef, Miss Morris?"
948,ISABELLA. I!,
949,ISABELLA. I!,"ALGERNON. No, papa, help me first!"
950,ISABELLA. I!,
951,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. M. Algy Pop-eyes Montague! be still! Here, Toby, hand Miss Morris"
952,ISABELLA. I!,her plate.
953,ISABELLA. I!,
954,ISABELLA. I!,"ALGY. Don't you do it, Toby!"
955,ISABELLA. I!,
956,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Hush up, you naughty boy!"
957,ISABELLA. I!,
958,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. M. Mr. Morris, here's some meat for you."
959,ISABELLA. I!,
960,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Take some macaroni, Mr. Morris; it's real good."
961,ISABELLA. I!,
962,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Thank you, ma'am; I think I will."
963,ISABELLA. I!,
964,ISABELLA. I!,"So the company were helped; though, as the meat and vegetables were"
965,ISABELLA. I!,"glued fast to the dishes they were on, I'm afraid they must have had"
966,ISABELLA. I!,rather a slim dinner.
967,ISABELLA. I!,
968,ISABELLA. I!,Then Maggie went on.
969,ISABELLA. I!,
970,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS ISABELLA. Mr. Morris, I think I am rather tired of that uniform of"
971,ISABELLA. I!,"yours; it makes you look too high in the neck. When we are married, you"
972,ISABELLA. I!,ought to have a dress coat.
973,ISABELLA. I!,
974,ISABELLA. I!,ANGELINA. H-a! h-a-a-a! he hasn't got any other coat! _I_ wouldn't marry
975,ISABELLA. I!,an old goose with only one suit!
976,ISABELLA. I!,
977,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. For shame, Miss! your father hadn't but one when we were"
978,ISABELLA. I!,"married; but, bless me! what _is_ Algernon doing?"
979,ISABELLA. I!,
980,ISABELLA. I!,"Sure enough, Master Algy _was_ doing something extraordinary, for Maggie"
981,ISABELLA. I!,"had made him overset the dish of potatoes in the middle of the table,"
982,ISABELLA. I!,"and then jump up and sit on the back of his chair, with both legs in the"
983,ISABELLA. I!,air!
984,ISABELLA. I!,
985,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. My pasence! _what_ a naughty boy! Toby, take this bad boy right"
986,ISABELLA. I!,up stairs; I am socked! (shocked.)
987,ISABELLA. I!,
988,ISABELLA. I!,"ALGY. Oh, boo-hoo! boo-hoo! please let me stay!"
989,ISABELLA. I!,
990,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Well, then, behave yourself."
991,ISABELLA. I!,
992,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS MORRIS. Mrs. Montague, I think you had _better_ send your children"
993,ISABELLA. I!,away; they are too bad for anything.
994,ISABELLA. I!,
995,ISABELLA. I!,"ANGELINA. Oh! oh! I wouldn't be your child for a dollar! (""That's just"
996,ISABELLA. I!,"what I say to my big sister!"" put in Maggie in her proper person.)"
997,ISABELLA. I!,
998,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Oh, they are dear little things; they only do it in fun, Miss"
999,ISABELLA. I!,Morris.
1000,ISABELLA. I!,
1001,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Well, I don't see it. If they were my children, I should"
1002,ISABELLA. I!,lock them up in a dark closet.
1003,ISABELLA. I!,
1004,ISABELLA. I!,MISS MORRIS. So should I.
1005,ISABELLA. I!,
1006,ISABELLA. I!,ANGELINA. H-a! h-a-a-a! that's just where you are kept yourself!
1007,ISABELLA. I!,
1008,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS MORRIS. Oh, I _shall_ faint!"
1009,ISABELLA. I!,
1010,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Angelina! you sha'n't have any pudding for being so bad. There,"
1011,ISABELLA. I!,"I guess it's time for dessert,""--and without condescending to ask if the"
1012,ISABELLA. I!,"company were through dinner, Mrs. Montague, with a wave of her"
1013,ISABELLA. I!,"lily-white kid hand, ordered Toby to clear away the dishes; and, the"
1014,ISABELLA. I!,"pudding and jelly being put on the table, Lina went on:"
1015,ISABELLA. I!,
1016,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. M. Miss Morris, have some plum-pudding?"
1017,ISABELLA. I!,
1018,ISABELLA. I!,"TOBY. No, take some ob de jolly, missis; he so _jolly_ good! _I_ taste"
1019,ISABELLA. I!,um!
1020,ISABELLA. I!,
1021,ISABELLA. I!,"Mr. M. Toby, I am _astonissed_! I shall have to discharge you to-morrow."
1022,ISABELLA. I!,
1023,ISABELLA. I!,"""And have an Irishman come!"" cried Minnie; ""and talk funny, like our"
1024,ISABELLA. I!,"Patrick!"""
1025,ISABELLA. I!,
1026,ISABELLA. I!,"""Yes, that will be real fun!"" said Lina. ""There, they have had dinner"
1027,ISABELLA. I!,"enough; let them go in the parlor now."""
1028,ISABELLA. I!,
1029,ISABELLA. I!,"Accordingly, the company had their chairs pushed back for them and were"
1030,ISABELLA. I!,"taken into the parlor, all but the naughty children, who had to be sent"
1031,ISABELLA. I!,"straight to bed, they were so bad. Mr. and Mrs. Montague took"
1032,ISABELLA. I!,"possession of the arm chairs, as they were the oldest; Miss Morris was"
1033,ISABELLA. I!,"accommodated with an uncommonly hard ottoman without any back, in the"
1034,ISABELLA. I!,"corner; Mr. Morris plumped down on the sofa, as that was the only seat"
1035,ISABELLA. I!,"large enough for him, and the play went on (Minnie speaking)."
1036,ISABELLA. I!,
1037,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Miss Isabella, I wish you would sing us a song."
1038,ISABELLA. I!,
1039,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Oh, really, I have _sitch_ a bad cold. I don't think I can."
1040,ISABELLA. I!,
1041,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Oh, please do, Miss Isabella! Sing that pretty song about"
1042,ISABELLA. I!,the little milkmaid.
1043,ISABELLA. I!,
1044,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Well, I'll see if I can."
1045,ISABELLA. I!,
1046,ISABELLA. I!,So Maggie made the young lady take a funny little scrap of music out of
1047,ISABELLA. I!,"the stand (called a Canterbury), and put it on the piano. The title of"
1048,ISABELLA. I!,"the piece on the outside was, ""Souvenirs de l'Opera,"" which means in"
1049,ISABELLA. I!,"English ""Recollections of the Opera,"" but it did just as well for a"
1050,ISABELLA. I!,"song. Miss Isabella was seated at the piano, and Maggie moved her hands"
1051,ISABELLA. I!,"up and down the keys, to look as if she were playing; while in her own"
1052,ISABELLA. I!,sweet bird-like voice she sang for her this song:
1053,ISABELLA. I!,
1054,ISABELLA. I!,"""'Where are you going, my pretty maid?"
1055,ISABELLA. I!,"Where are you going, my pretty maid?'"
1056,ISABELLA. I!,"'I'm going a milking, sir,' she said,"
1057,ISABELLA. I!,"'I'm going a milking, sir,' she said."
1058,ISABELLA. I!,
1059,ISABELLA. I!,"""'May I go with you, my pretty maid?"
1060,ISABELLA. I!,"May I go with you, my pretty maid?'"
1061,ISABELLA. I!,"'Yes, if you please, kind sir,' she said,"
1062,ISABELLA. I!,"'Yes, if you please, kind sir,' she said."
1063,ISABELLA. I!,
1064,ISABELLA. I!,"""'What is your father, my pretty maid?"
1065,ISABELLA. I!,"What is your father, my pretty maid?'"
1066,ISABELLA. I!,"'My father's a farmer, sir,' she said,"
1067,ISABELLA. I!,"'My father's a farmer, sir,' she said."
1068,ISABELLA. I!,
1069,ISABELLA. I!,"""'Oh, then may I marry you, my pretty maid?"
1070,ISABELLA. I!,"Then may I marry you, my pretty maid?'"
1071,ISABELLA. I!,"'Yes, if you please, kind sir,' she said,"
1072,ISABELLA. I!,"'Yes, if you please, kind sir,' she said."
1073,ISABELLA. I!,
1074,ISABELLA. I!,"""'What is your _fortune_, my pretty maid?"
1075,ISABELLA. I!,"What is your _fortune_, my pretty maid?'"
1076,ISABELLA. I!,"'My _face_ is my fortune, sir,' she said,"
1077,ISABELLA. I!,"'My _face_ is my fortune, sir,' she said."
1078,ISABELLA. I!,
1079,ISABELLA. I!,"""'Oh, then I _can't_ marry you, my pretty maid!"
1080,ISABELLA. I!,"But then I _won't_ marry you, my pretty maid!'"
1081,ISABELLA. I!,"'Nobody asked you, sir!' she said,"
1082,ISABELLA. I!,"'NOBODY ASKED YOU, SIR!!' she said!"""
1083,ISABELLA. I!,
1084,ISABELLA. I!,The dolls all clapped their hands very hard when Miss Isabella finished
1085,ISABELLA. I!,"singing, as if they liked it ""first rate."" Mr. Morris leaned back so far"
1086,ISABELLA. I!,"in his seat, either from admiration or because he was slipping off,"
1087,ISABELLA. I!,"that his eyes suddenly shut up, and opened with a queer little pop"
1088,ISABELLA. I!,"inside of him when Minnie righted him. As to Miss Morris, she glared at"
1089,ISABELLA. I!,the company with her old white eyeballs as if she was looking down
1090,ISABELLA. I!,inside of herself to see how the pudding had agreed with her.
1091,ISABELLA. I!,
1092,ISABELLA. I!,Then Maggie went on.
1093,ISABELLA. I!,
1094,ISABELLA. I!,MISS ISABELLA. There! how do you like _that_?
1095,ISABELLA. I!,
1096,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Oh, thank you, Miss Isabella; it's the sweetest song I ever"
1097,ISABELLA. I!,heard.
1098,ISABELLA. I!,
1099,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. MONTAGUE. Won't you sing us a song, Mr. Morris?"
1100,ISABELLA. I!,
1101,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. M. No, I believe I must go now. I have all my things to pack up, so"
1102,ISABELLA. I!,"we can start off travelling right away. Come, sister, stick the roots of"
1103,ISABELLA. I!,"your hair in, and open your distressed looking eyes, and let us be off"
1104,ISABELLA. I!,home.
1105,ISABELLA. I!,
1106,ISABELLA. I!,"""I wonder if her eyes _will_ open?"" said Maggie."
1107,ISABELLA. I!,
1108,ISABELLA. I!,"""Let's try!"" said Lina. ""Give the wire a good, hard pull."""
1109,ISABELLA. I!,
1110,ISABELLA. I!,"As she spoke, she caught hold of the wire and gave a tremendous jerk,"
1111,ISABELLA. I!,"when, dreadful to relate, POP! out came poor Miss Morris's eyes"
1112,ISABELLA. I!,completely! and tumbled down somewhere inside of her! leaving two great
1113,ISABELLA. I!,holes in her head of the most fearful description!
1114,ISABELLA. I!,
1115,ISABELLA. I!,The children stared at her in round-eyed astonishment. Now she was
1116,ISABELLA. I!,certainly too hideous to come to the wedding; and the little girls
1117,ISABELLA. I!,"tried to look as sorry as they could for her, but it was no use; Miss"
1118,ISABELLA. I!,"Morris was such a ridiculous object, that they all three burst into fits"
1119,ISABELLA. I!,"of laughing. Lina, who had hold of the poor thing, shook so with glee,"
1120,ISABELLA. I!,that the eyes rattled up and down inside her head like a pack of
1121,ISABELLA. I!,"crackers going off, which made the children laugh still more."
1122,ISABELLA. I!,
1123,ISABELLA. I!,"At last Minnie contrived to check herself, and made the brother say,"
1124,ISABELLA. I!,rather unfeelingly:
1125,ISABELLA. I!,
1126,ISABELLA. I!,Mr. Morris. There you go with your eyes out! A pretty figure you've made
1127,ISABELLA. I!,of yourself.
1128,ISABELLA. I!,
1129,ISABELLA. I!,Miss Isabella. Oh! _oh!!_ OH!!! OH!!!!
1130,ISABELLA. I!,
1131,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Goody, Isabella's got the hysterics! Get some water, quick! what"
1132,ISABELLA. I!,shall I do?
1133,ISABELLA. I!,
1134,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS MORRIS. Oh, my eye! my eye! it's _sich_ a pain!"
1135,ISABELLA. I!,
1136,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MONTAGUE. Toby, bring some water this minute."
1137,ISABELLA. I!,
1138,ISABELLA. I!,"TOBY. (_Minnie brings him in with a pitcher._) Here, massa, here de"
1139,ISABELLA. I!,water. My! see de ole woman wid her eye out! ha! ha!
1140,ISABELLA. I!,
1141,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Toby, put down that water, and go 'way."
1142,ISABELLA. I!,
1143,ISABELLA. I!,Minnie accordingly made believe that Toby was pouring water right on the
1144,ISABELLA. I!,"floor; then she turned the pitcher upside down in his hand, and spoke"
1145,ISABELLA. I!,for him.
1146,ISABELLA. I!,
1147,ISABELLA. I!,"TOBY. Dere de water, missis."
1148,ISABELLA. I!,
1149,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Oh! it's all over the carpet! How dare you, Toby?"
1150,ISABELLA. I!,
1151,ISABELLA. I!,"TOBY. Why, missis, you _told_ me to put down de _water_!"
1152,ISABELLA. I!,
1153,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Oh, I shall go distracted!"
1154,ISABELLA. I!,
1155,ISABELLA. I!,"MR. MORRIS. Come, sister, I 'spect you'd better go home and send for"
1156,ISABELLA. I!,"Doctor Bumpstead! Maybe he can fish up your eyes again, and stick them"
1157,ISABELLA. I!,"in right side out. A--h! good-by, Miss Isabella, good-by, Mrs. Montague!"
1158,ISABELLA. I!,
1159,ISABELLA. I!,"ALL THE DOLLS IN CHORUS. Good-by, a--h!"
1160,ISABELLA. I!,
1161,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh! did ever anybody have such a funny play before!"" cried Lina, fairly"
1162,ISABELLA. I!,"dropping Miss Morris, and clapping her hands with delight. ""I mean"
1163,ISABELLA. I!,"always to play in this way."""
1164,ISABELLA. I!,
1165,ISABELLA. I!,"""Yes, it is so nice!"" said Minnie. ""But, come, Lina, how shall we dress"
1166,ISABELLA. I!,"Miss Isabella to get married?"""
1167,ISABELLA. I!,
1168,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, she has a wedding-dress all ready,"" replied Lina; ""white silk with"
1169,ISABELLA. I!,"lace over."""
1170,ISABELLA. I!,
1171,ISABELLA. I!,"""Splendid!"" cried both the sisters."
1172,ISABELLA. I!,
1173,ISABELLA. I!,"""Now, if Mr. Morris could only have a plain suit, he would look so much"
1174,ISABELLA. I!,"more like a bridegroom."""
1175,ISABELLA. I!,
1176,ISABELLA. I!,"""Well, perhaps sister will make him one,"" said Lina; ""but what shall we"
1177,ISABELLA. I!,"do with poor Miss Morris?"""
1178,ISABELLA. I!,
1179,ISABELLA. I!,The recollection of Miss Morris's mishap set them off again laughing;
1180,ISABELLA. I!,"and finally they decided that she might come to the wedding, but must"
1181,ISABELLA. I!,"keep her handkerchief to her eyes all the time, as if she were quite"
1182,ISABELLA. I!,"overcome by having her brother married; as well she might be, for how"
1183,ISABELLA. I!,would her two holes instead of eyes compare with Miss Isabella Belmont
1184,ISABELLA. I!,Montague's charms?
1185,ISABELLA. I!,
1186,ISABELLA. I!,"This point settled, Lina and her little visitors were just beginning to"
1187,ISABELLA. I!,"review the other dolls, to see who would look best at the wedding, when"
1188,ISABELLA. I!,"a knock came at the door, and in walked Mary, Lina's nurse, to say that"
1189,ISABELLA. I!,Minnie and Maggie were sent for!
1190,ISABELLA. I!,
1191,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, what a pity!"" cried Lina. ""I wish you could stay all day, and all"
1192,ISABELLA. I!,"night, and all the rest of the time. It's too bad!"""
1193,ISABELLA. I!,
1194,ISABELLA. I!,"""Oh, that the afternoons were forty-'leven times as long!"" said Maggie."
1195,ISABELLA. I!,"""Well, we must go, I suppose. Good-by, Lina; we'll come Monday"
1196,ISABELLA. I!,"afternoon, if mamma will let us; and finish the play."""
1197,ISABELLA. I!,
1198,ISABELLA. I!,"So the children kissed each other, and Minnie and Maggie were bundled up"
1199,ISABELLA. I!,"in their warm coats and hoods, and went home. As soon as they were gone,"
1200,ISABELLA. I!,"Lina ran to her sister Alice with Mr. Morris, and begged her to make him"
1201,ISABELLA. I!,"a suit of black to get married in, as Miss Isabella had expressed her"
1202,ISABELLA. I!,"preference for that style of dress. Alice kindly promised she would, and"
1203,ISABELLA. I!,that very evening she hunted up some black cloth that was left from a
1204,ISABELLA. I!,"cloak of her mother's, and in a few hours Mr. Morris was rigged out in"
1205,ISABELLA. I!,"the last style of fashion. Here is his carte de visite, taken in his"
1206,ISABELLA. I!,"wedding clothes. You see, the photograph man left his own hat on the"
1207,ISABELLA. I!,table by mistake; doesn't it look funny?
1208,ISABELLA. I!,
1209,ISABELLA. I!,[Illustration: Portrait of Mr. Morris.]
1210,ISABELLA. I!,
1211,ISABELLA. I!,It was past Lina's bedtime before Mr. Morris was completely dressed; but
1212,ISABELLA. I!,"she was allowed to sit up ""just this once,"" and when he was finished,"
1213,ISABELLA. I!,"she kissed Alice a great many times, carried him off in triumph, and"
1214,ISABELLA. I!,"shut him up tight in a box, for fear his clothes should get tumbled."
1215,ISABELLA. I!,
1216,ISABELLA. I!,"Monday afternoon, Minnie and Maggie came again, bringing with them a"
1217,ISABELLA. I!,"dear little wax doll of Minnie's, and a great paper of sugar-plums, to"
1218,ISABELLA. I!,"""play party"" with. When Mr. Morris had been sufficiently admired in his"
1219,ISABELLA. I!,"new clothes, the children collected the other dolls, and put the"
1220,ISABELLA. I!,Montague family in their house again. Mr. Montague was left all alone in
1221,ISABELLA. I!,"the parlor to receive the company, and the ladies were up stairs in the"
1222,ISABELLA. I!,front bed room. Miss Isabella's wedding dress was spread out on the
1223,ISABELLA. I!,"elegant French bed, all ready for her to wear; and as it is a well-known"
1224,ISABELLA. I!,fact that a fashionable lady cannot possibly get dressed in less than
1225,ISABELLA. I!,"three hours, the time was put at nine o'clock, as the wedding would take"
1226,ISABELLA. I!,place at twelve.
1227,ISABELLA. I!,
1228,ISABELLA. I!,Lina then began the play:
1229,ISABELLA. I!,
1230,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. MONTAGUE. Come, my dear, it is time for you to dress; you've only"
1231,ISABELLA. I!,got three hours to get all ready in.
1232,ISABELLA. I!,
1233,ISABELLA. I!,"MISS ISABELLA. Yes, mamma, I am putting on my shoes now. (That is,"
1234,ISABELLA. I!,"Maggie was putting them on.) Oh, dear! they are a great deal too tight!"
1235,ISABELLA. I!,they hurt me _dreadfully_. Please let me take them off.
1236,ISABELLA. I!,
1237,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. No, they are not; they are a beautiful fit; don't be silly,"
1238,ISABELLA. I!,Isabella.
1239,ISABELLA. I!,
1240,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. I think you are real mean! There, they are on; now I must put"
1241,ISABELLA. I!,on my dress.
1242,ISABELLA. I!,
1243,ISABELLA. I!,"Here Maggie made her stand up, and Lina put on her dress and fastened"
1244,ISABELLA. I!,it.
1245,ISABELLA. I!,
1246,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Oh, my! what a beautiful dress! Can't I keep it on all the"
1247,ISABELLA. I!,"time, mamma?"
1248,ISABELLA. I!,
1249,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Why, no; of course not! This is your wedding dress."
1250,ISABELLA. I!,
1251,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Well, then, I mean to get married over again next year, so I"
1252,ISABELLA. I!,can wear it some more.
1253,ISABELLA. I!,
1254,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Now I must put on your veil, my dear, and then you will be all"
1255,ISABELLA. I!,ready.
1256,ISABELLA. I!,
1257,ISABELLA. I!,"Here Maggie clapped her hands to express Miss Isabella's joy, while Lina"
1258,ISABELLA. I!,put on the veil.
1259,ISABELLA. I!,
1260,ISABELLA. I!,"ISABELLA. Oh, how pretty I look!"
1261,ISABELLA. I!,
1262,ISABELLA. I!,"MRS. M. Don't be vain, Isabella. There, you are dressed; sit down now,"
1263,ISABELLA. I!,while I get ready.
1264,ISABELLA. I!,
1265,ISABELLA. I!,So Miss Isabella sat down with her new frock sticking out all around
1266,ISABELLA. I!,"her, like a perfect balloon, a most magnificent creature to behold! Her"
1267,ISABELLA. I!,"dress was made of white silk, trimmed all round the bottom with deep"
1268,ISABELLA. I!,"blonde lace, which was finished at the top with narrow silver cord. It"
1269,ISABELLA. I!,"was looped up on one side with a bouquet of white flowers, with silver"
1270,ISABELLA. I!,"leaves, and her waist was covered with a blonde lace bertha, and had a"
1271,ISABELLA. I!,"bouquet of the same flowers on the front, called a _corsage_. She wore a"
1272,ISABELLA. I!,"lace veil and a wreath of orange blossoms, and in her hand, tied fast"
1273,ISABELLA. I!,"there, was another large bouquet, and a lace-bordered pocket"
1274,ISABELLA. I!,"handkerchief. As to Mrs. Montague, she was hardly less splendidly"
1275,ISABELLA. I!,"attired, in a mauve silk with eleven flounces, a lace collar and"
1276,ISABELLA. I!,"sleeves, and a superb diamond breastpin--made of glass."
1277,ISABELLA. I!,
1278,ISABELLA. I!,"Well, dear me, I don't know how I can find room enough to describe all"
1279,ISABELLA. I!,the splendid ladies that came to the wedding. They were none of them
1280,ISABELLA. I!,"quite as elegant as Miss Isabella Belmont Montague, but they all had on"
1281,ISABELLA. I!,"their Sunday-go-to-meeting, Fourth-of-July, Christmas-and-New-Year's"
1282,ISABELLA. I!,"best clothes, and looked as fine as fiddles. Poor Miss Morris came, with"
1283,ISABELLA. I!,"her handkerchief up to her eyes, and stayed so all the time, crying as"
1284,ISABELLA. I!,"if her heart would break, I presume. She was so dismal, in her old green"
1285,ISABELLA. I!,"barège, that Minnie kindly dressed her in Mrs. Montague's purple silk,"
1286,ISABELLA. I!,"which fitted her quite well; so she didn't look so _very_ bad, after"
1287,ISABELLA. I!,all. Aren't you glad? I am.
1288,ISABELLA. I!,
1289,ISABELLA. I!,"Pretty soon in came the minister, who was no other than Angelina! as her"
1290,ISABELLA. I!,black nun's robe was the most like a gown that could be found; and when
1291,ISABELLA. I!,"she was set up with her back against the centre table, the parlor door"
1292,ISABELLA. I!,"opened, and in marched the bride and bridegroom. Minnie and Maggie held"
1293,ISABELLA. I!,"them in their proper places, and the minister married them in rhyme;"
1294,ISABELLA. I!,"which, it strikes me, was a new style. This was what he said:"
1295,ISABELLA. I!,
1296,ISABELLA. I!,"""Now you're married, you must obey;"
1297,ISABELLA. I!,"You must be true to all you say,"
1298,ISABELLA. I!,And live together all your life;
1299,ISABELLA. I!,"And I pronounce you man and wife!"""
1300,ISABELLA. I!,
1301,ISABELLA. I!,"When the marriage ceremony was over, the children set Mr. and Mrs."
1302,ISABELLA. I!,"Morris down side by side on the sofa, and leaving them to entertain the"
1303,ISABELLA. I!,"company, and talk for themselves if they could, got the supper ready."
1304,ISABELLA. I!,It was such a grand supper that they were obliged to have a table from
1305,ISABELLA. I!,up stairs besides the dining table. Everything in the box of eatables
1306,ISABELLA. I!,"was brought out, even the roast beef and buttered toast, two dishes not"
1307,ISABELLA. I!,ordinarily seen at suppers. The sugar-plums were disposed around
1308,ISABELLA. I!,"wherever room could be found, and when everything was ready, Minnie took"
1309,ISABELLA. I!,Toby to the parlor door and made him say:
1310,ISABELLA. I!,
1311,TOBY.,TOBY.
1312,TOBY.,"Ladies and gentlemens, please to come to supper,"
1313,TOBY.,"Plum cake, and cream cake, and white bread and butter."
1314,TOBY.,
1315,TOBY.,Up jumped Mr. Morris in such a violent hurry that he nearly tumbled
1316,TOBY.,"over, and offered his arm to his bride; which Minnie made him do by"
1317,TOBY.,"bending it round, and pinning his kid hand fast to his waistcoat."
1318,TOBY.,Maggie and Lina made the rest of the company walk after them in
1319,TOBY.,"procession, as fast as they could lift them up; and they all pranced and"
1320,TOBY.,paraded round by the back of the house into the dining room. Only poor
1321,TOBY.,"Miss Morris was left out, and she had tumbled off her chair, and was"
1322,TOBY.,"lying behind the piano, on the top of her head, with one leg sticking"
1323,TOBY.,"straight up in the air like an awning post, and the other foot"
1324,TOBY.,"apparently boxing her ears, as it was turned back in a most"
1325,TOBY.,"extraordinary manner, till it touched her head."
1326,TOBY.,
1327,TOBY.,"Meanwhile, there were fine times going on in the dining room. Mr."
1328,TOBY.,"Montague took the foot of the table, and the bride and groom the head."
1329,TOBY.,"As soon as they were all seated, Mr. Montague said:"
1330,TOBY.,
1331,TOBY.,"MR. MONTAGUE. Ladies and gentlemen, don't you think we'd better drink"
1332,TOBY.,"the bride's health? Here, Toby, give the company some wine glasses."
1333,TOBY.,
1334,TOBY.,"MRS. M. Dear me, ladies, what a pity! there's only six goblets; so the"
1335,TOBY.,rest will have to drink out of teacups!
1336,TOBY.,
1337,TOBY.,"ALL THE DOLLS (or all the three little girls, whichever you please). Oh,"
1338,TOBY.,never mind; that doesn't make any _difference_.
1339,TOBY.,
1340,TOBY.,"MR. MONT. The bride, ladies and gentlemen!"
1341,TOBY.,
1342,TOBY.,ALL THE DOLLS. Mrs. Morris! hurray! hurree! hurror!
1343,TOBY.,
1344,TOBY.,"MRS. M. Now, Isabella, it's time for you to change your dress, my dear."
1345,TOBY.,"You are going travelling, you know."
1346,TOBY.,
1347,TOBY.,"ISABELLA. Oh, what a pity! I don't want to take it off a bit!"
1348,TOBY.,
1349,TOBY.,"But, of course, she had to. It wouldn't have done to go travelling in a"
1350,TOBY.,"white silk dress, would it, you dear little poppet?"
1351,TOBY.,
1352,TOBY.,So Maggie took Miss Isabella (for they called her either that or Mrs.
1353,TOBY.,"Morris by turns, indifferently), away from table, and dressed her in her"
1354,TOBY.,"gray travelling dress, which was trimmed with black velvet and small"
1355,TOBY.,"steel buttons. Then she put on her second best bonnet, with a blue veil,"
1356,TOBY.,"and her India-rubbers, in case it should be damp, and locked up the"
1357,TOBY.,"wedding dress in her trunk, which was about as large as a candle box,"
1358,TOBY.,"had a real little lock and key, and her initials painted on the side."
1359,TOBY.,"When she was all ready, down she came again, to take leave of her"
1360,TOBY.,"relations and friends, who had eaten up all the wooden refreshments by"
1361,TOBY.,"this time (though, strange to say, the dishes seemed as full as ever),"
1362,TOBY.,"while Minnie, Maggie, and Lina eat up the sugar plums; and poor Miss"
1363,TOBY.,"Morris sucked her thumbs, I suppose, for not a speck of anything else"
1364,TOBY.,did she get.
1365,TOBY.,
1366,TOBY.,"There was a great time bidding good-by, and so many hard noses were"
1367,TOBY.,"bumped against the bride's cheek this time, that they made a dent, which"
1368,TOBY.,"looked quite like a dimple, and improved her appearance very much"
1369,TOBY.,"indeed. As to Mr. Morris, nobody took the slightest notice of him, as is"
1370,TOBY.,"usually the case with the bridegroom, but he didn't seem to mind it in"
1371,TOBY.,the least; for he went on smirking at the company as blandly as ever.
1372,TOBY.,Perhaps he didn't want people's noses making holes in _his_ face; you
1373,TOBY.,"wouldn't want them made in _yours_, would you? you dear little Pinkey"
1374,TOBY.,Winkey! Bless your heart! there's dimples enough in that cunning face
1375,TOBY.,already.
1376,TOBY.,
1377,TOBY.,"But now the carriage was brought round to the door, for Mr. and Mrs."
1378,TOBY.,"Morris to go on their travels. It was made of--ahem!--tin, and was drawn"
1379,TOBY.,"by two dashing tin horses, with tails like comets, and manes like"
1380,TOBY.,"waterfalls, and such a great number of bright red spots painted all"
1381,TOBY.,"over them, that they looked as if they had broken out with a kind of"
1382,TOBY.,scarlet measles.
1383,TOBY.,
1384,TOBY.,"The bride and bridegroom were put in their places, the big trunk was"
1385,TOBY.,"hoisted up in front, and away they went! and travelled all the way down"
1386,TOBY.,"the entry to the head of the stairs, and through sister Alice's room to"
1387,TOBY.,"the fireplace! My! what a long journey! 'most a hundred miles, I should"
1388,TOBY.,"think! that is, it would seem so to dolls."
1389,TOBY.,
1390,TOBY.,"Thus ended the grand play of Miss Isabella Belmont Montague's wedding,"
1391,TOBY.,"which had taken two whole afternoons to finish, and which the children"
1392,TOBY.,thought the most _interestingest_ play that ever was. If you want to
1393,TOBY.,"know what became of her after that, I advise you to go right to Lina's"
1394,TOBY.,house and ask how Mr. and Mrs. Morris come on with their housekeeping!
1395,TOBY.,That's all there is of this story--BOO!!

1401,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1402,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1403,THE FAIRY WISH.,"ONCE upon a time there lived a little old man, with his little old wife,"
1404,THE FAIRY WISH.,"in a little old house that ran on wheels. Did you ever? Well, I never"
1405,THE FAIRY WISH.,did.
1406,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1407,THE FAIRY WISH.,"The reason why the little old house ran on wheels was, that the little"
1408,THE FAIRY WISH.,"old man used to keep a monkey show in it, and drove it about for a"
1409,THE FAIRY WISH.,"caravan; with an old white horse, that had a blind eye, to draw it; but"
1410,THE FAIRY WISH.,"now the monkeys were all dead and buried, and the little old man and"
1411,THE FAIRY WISH.,"woman lived all alone-ty-donty. It had bright green blinds, bright red"
1412,THE FAIRY WISH.,"sides, a bright blue door, and bright yellow steps. On the bright blue"
1413,THE FAIRY WISH.,"door there was a bright brass knocker, which was polished up at such a"
1414,THE FAIRY WISH.,"rate that you could see your face in it, looking as l-o-n-g as anything;"
1415,THE FAIRY WISH.,"and underneath that was a bright brass door plate, with the old"
1416,THE FAIRY WISH.,"showman's name, ""Timmy Timmens,"" on it, which was also polished up until"
1417,THE FAIRY WISH.,"you could see your face in it, looking as b-r-o-a-d as anything. Did you"
1418,THE FAIRY WISH.,"_ever_? Well, I _never_ did!"
1419,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1420,THE FAIRY WISH.,Inside there was a rag carpet of all the colors of the rainbow; a little
1421,THE FAIRY WISH.,"old four-post bedstead, with a patchwork counterpane; two high-backed"
1422,THE FAIRY WISH.,"rocking chairs, with patchwork covers over the backs; a table with an"
1423,THE FAIRY WISH.,"oil cloth cover, that had a little old tea tray on it, set up against"
1424,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the wall; two bright brass candlesticks, and a china tea set; and in one"
1425,THE FAIRY WISH.,"corner was a glass cupboard, which contained the other plates and"
1426,THE FAIRY WISH.,dishes. Hung against the wall over the mantlepiece was a sampler worked
1427,THE FAIRY WISH.,"by Mrs. Timmy Timmens when she was a girl, which represented Noah's ark,"
1428,THE FAIRY WISH.,"with all the animals, of exactly the same size, done in cross stitch, in"
1429,THE FAIRY WISH.,such bright grass-green worsted that it quite set your teeth on edge to
1430,THE FAIRY WISH.,"look at it. Besides these, there was a little round stove, with a long"
1431,THE FAIRY WISH.,"stove pipe, that came out on top of the caravan, and ended with a"
1432,THE FAIRY WISH.,"flourishing weathercock, representing a fat old woman in a high gale,"
1433,THE FAIRY WISH.,with her umbrella turned inside out; which moved when the smoke came
1434,THE FAIRY WISH.,"puffing up harder than usual, and had no connection whatever with any"
1435,THE FAIRY WISH.,wind that blew.
1436,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1437,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Now, Mr. Timmy Timmens and his wife, being mighty simple old people,"
1438,THE FAIRY WISH.,"were fond of reading fairy stories, and believed entirely in every word"
1439,THE FAIRY WISH.,of them. They hadn't the smallest doubt that sprites and fairies were as
1440,THE FAIRY WISH.,"common as peas this very minute, and would have thought it quite a"
1441,THE FAIRY WISH.,matter of course if a wonderful gift had suddenly tumbled down the very
1442,THE FAIRY WISH.,"stove pipe, or a beautiful lady come bursting through the wall, and"
1443,THE FAIRY WISH.,"offered to carry them off to fairy land in a mother-of-pearl chariot,"
1444,THE FAIRY WISH.,drawn by milk-white doves. If a cat looked hard at her and mewed
1445,THE FAIRY WISH.,"piteously, the little old woman would sigh, ""Well, this _is_ fairy work,"
1446,THE FAIRY WISH.,"I'll bet a crooked sixpence! She looks like an enchanted princess, poor"
1447,THE FAIRY WISH.,"thing! don't she, Timmy, dear?"" If a donkey brayed louder than usual,"
1448,THE FAIRY WISH.,"and seemed more obstinate than ever before, the little old man would"
1449,THE FAIRY WISH.,"exclaim, ""There, I told you so! an unfortunate young man, of surpassing"
1450,THE FAIRY WISH.,"beauty, enchanted in this dreadful shape by a wicked fairy! That's plain"
1451,THE FAIRY WISH.,"to be seen! No wonder he utters such cries of distress!"" and then they"
1452,THE FAIRY WISH.,"both groaned together, and waggled their heads, and blew their noses so"
1453,THE FAIRY WISH.,"exactly in time with two yellow silk pocket handkerchiefs, that people"
1454,THE FAIRY WISH.,thought two fishmen must be blowing their horns at once. Did _you_
1455,THE FAIRY WISH.,"ever? Well, _I_ never did!"
1456,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1457,THE FAIRY WISH.,[Illustration: THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN LOOKING FOR FAIRIES.]
1458,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1459,THE FAIRY WISH.,One fine morning the little old man and woman went out to take a walk on
1460,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the common; for the house stood right beside the road, in an empty field"
1461,THE FAIRY WISH.,"of scrubby grass, with no fence round it. Just behind the house, to be"
1462,THE FAIRY WISH.,"sure, was a paling, which enclosed a garden about as big as a good-sized"
1463,THE FAIRY WISH.,"dining table, where the little old man and woman grew one or two"
1464,THE FAIRY WISH.,"cabbages, two or three tomatuses, three or four potatuses, and four or"
1465,THE FAIRY WISH.,"five radishes, for their own eating; but all the rest was just open"
1466,THE FAIRY WISH.,"common. The old woman had a large basket in her hand, all ready to pop"
1467,THE FAIRY WISH.,"down over any fairies she might see lying asleep in a bluebell, and the"
1468,THE FAIRY WISH.,"old man was leaning heavily on his stick, as he was rather feeble, and,"
1469,THE FAIRY WISH.,"besides, had the rheumatism in his big toe."
1470,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1471,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Dear me, Timmy,"" said the old woman, ""what a good thing it would be,"
1472,THE FAIRY WISH.,"now, if we could only find a kind fairy who would move our house for us"
1473,THE FAIRY WISH.,"somewhere nearer the village. Now that poor old Dobbin is dead--killed,"
1474,THE FAIRY WISH.,"I've no doubt, by a wicked enchanter--we can no longer get around from"
1475,THE FAIRY WISH.,place to place without stirring a step from the house; and we are so far
1476,THE FAIRY WISH.,"away, that we can't walk over to take tea with any of our neighbors. Do"
1477,THE FAIRY WISH.,"let us keep a sharp lookout as we walk along, and see if we can't find"
1478,THE FAIRY WISH.,"a fairy ring or a fairy flower."""
1479,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1480,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""With all my heart!"" said Tim; and so they tottered along, peering very"
1481,THE FAIRY WISH.,"hard into all the bushes, and hurrying to examine every little patch of"
1482,THE FAIRY WISH.,"grass that looked greener and brighter than the rest, in the hope that"
1483,THE FAIRY WISH.,"it was a fairy ring. All at once, the little old man stopped short, and"
1484,THE FAIRY WISH.,pointed with his stick at a beautiful spray of foxglove.
1485,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1486,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""There!"" cried Mr. Timmens."
1487,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1488,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Where?"" cried Mrs. Timmens."
1489,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1490,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Right before your eyes!"" said the little old man. ""Don't you see it? A"
1491,THE FAIRY WISH.,"fairy foxglove, as my name is Timmy Timmens!"""
1492,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1493,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""My goodness gracious, stars, and what's-his-names!"" cried the little"
1494,THE FAIRY WISH.,"old woman; ""so there is! as sure as my name is Polly Timmens!"""
1495,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1496,THE FAIRY WISH.,"So the little old man and woman hurried up to the flower, and after"
1497,THE FAIRY WISH.,"trying a great many times to stoop down, making their old joints crack"
1498,THE FAIRY WISH.,"like so many torpedoes, Mrs. Polly succeeded in plucking it, and off"
1499,THE FAIRY WISH.,"they went, pell-mell, hurry-scurry, to the little old house that ran on"
1500,THE FAIRY WISH.,"wheels, to consult their fairy story books, and see what was the right"
1501,THE FAIRY WISH.,"thing to be done in such a case! _Did_ you ever? Well, I never _did_."
1502,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1503,THE FAIRY WISH.,Down sat the little old man in _his_ rocking chair with the patchwork
1504,THE FAIRY WISH.,"cover, and down sat the little old woman in _her_ rocking chair with"
1505,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the patchwork cover; and after a long consultation of the ""Sorrows of"
1506,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Prince Popinjay,"" and the ""Wonderful History of the Princess Lillie"
1507,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Bulero and the Fairy Allinmieyeo,"" they discovered that the proper way"
1508,THE FAIRY WISH.,to do was to hold the fairy foxglove in your hand exactly as the clock
1509,THE FAIRY WISH.,"struck twelve, at noon, and say"
1510,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1511,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Rorum corum torum snoram,"
1512,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Highcum tickleme cockolorum!"""
1513,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1514,THE FAIRY WISH.,"seven times; then shut your eyes tight and wish, stand on one leg and"
1515,THE FAIRY WISH.,"turn round three times, and, presto! you would find, when you opened"
1516,THE FAIRY WISH.,"your eyes, that your wish was accomplished!"
1517,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1518,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Dear me!"" cried Mrs. Polly Timmens when her husband had finished"
1519,THE FAIRY WISH.,"reading this wonderful charm; ""how lucky it is that we should be the"
1520,THE FAIRY WISH.,"ones to find the fairy foxglove! just as we were wishing, too, for"
1521,THE FAIRY WISH.,"something of the sort. Let me see, it is half past eleven now, I"
1522,THE FAIRY WISH.,"declare! Timmy, my dear, I'll go into the garden and gather two or three"
1523,THE FAIRY WISH.,"tomatuses and three or four potatuses for dinner, for it would be a"
1524,THE FAIRY WISH.,"shame to leave our fine vegetables behind; and then, as the clock"
1525,THE FAIRY WISH.,"strikes twelve, we'll try the fairy spell, wish that our house was in"
1526,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the village, and see what comes of it."""
1527,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1528,THE FAIRY WISH.,"So the little old woman, taking a small basket off a nail, and a sharp"
1529,THE FAIRY WISH.,"knife in her hand, went into the garden to gather the vegetables. Down"
1530,THE FAIRY WISH.,"she plumped beside the bed, and began to dig and cut at the potatuses"
1531,THE FAIRY WISH.,"to get them up. Her back was turned to the house, and the tall stalks"
1532,THE FAIRY WISH.,and thick leaves of the tomato bushes quite hid it from her view when
1533,THE FAIRY WISH.,"she sat on the ground, for she was a teeny-tawny little old woman. While"
1534,THE FAIRY WISH.,"she was thus engaged, the little old man was sitting inside with the"
1535,THE FAIRY WISH.,"book open in one hand, for fear he should forget the charm, and the"
1536,THE FAIRY WISH.,"fairy foxglove tight in the other, waiting impatiently for her return."
1537,THE FAIRY WISH.,"The hands of the clock kept getting nearer and nearer to twelve, and at"
1538,THE FAIRY WISH.,last there was only one moment wanting to the time.
1539,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1540,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Why, goodness gracious me!"" cried Mr. Timmy Timmens; ""has Polly forgot"
1541,THE FAIRY WISH.,"all about the fairy wish? I declare, I have a great mind to begin"
1542,THE FAIRY WISH.,"alone."" Just as he said these words, the clock began to strike! and at"
1543,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the same moment a tremendous hullabaloo arose on the road. ""There come"
1544,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the fairies!"" squeaked the little old man; and without waiting another"
1545,THE FAIRY WISH.,"second, he stood straight up in the middle of the floor, and said, in a"
1546,THE FAIRY WISH.,trembling voice:
1547,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1548,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Rorum corum torum snorum,"
1549,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Highcum tickleme cockolorum!"""
1550,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1551,THE FAIRY WISH.,"seven times over; then, shutting up his eyes as tight as possible, stood"
1552,THE FAIRY WISH.,"on one leg, and cried, ""Please, good fairy, Polly and I wish our house"
1553,THE FAIRY WISH.,"was in the middle of the village!"""
1554,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1555,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Hardly had he said these words, than a long red object, that looked"
1556,THE FAIRY WISH.,"wonderfully like a cow's tail, suddenly whisked in at the half open"
1557,THE FAIRY WISH.,"door; the wind caught the door, and shut it to, slam! bang! and with a"
1558,THE FAIRY WISH.,jerk that made the bright brass knocker give a tremendous double knock
1559,THE FAIRY WISH.,"on the bright blue door, and sent the bright tin saucepans scattering in"
1560,THE FAIRY WISH.,"every direction, the house started suddenly down on the road on a"
1561,THE FAIRY WISH.,"double-quick trot! Did you EVER?! Well, I NEVER did!!"
1562,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1563,THE FAIRY WISH.,It happened that a large drove of cows and oxen were going down to
1564,THE FAIRY WISH.,"market that day, and being very hot, and tired, and thirsty, they"
1565,THE FAIRY WISH.,"naturally objected to being driven in that way any longer, and commenced"
1566,THE FAIRY WISH.,cutting a variety of capers that were enough to frighten you out of
1567,THE FAIRY WISH.,"your wits. At last one irascible little bull, who had been riding on the"
1568,THE FAIRY WISH.,"other ones' backs, charging at all the innocent ducks, geese, and pigs"
1569,THE FAIRY WISH.,"he could find on the road, and finally had tossed one of the men who"
1570,THE FAIRY WISH.,"were driving him right up in the air, dashed on ahead, and, seeing the"
1571,THE FAIRY WISH.,"little house with the bright red sides, took the color as a personal"
1572,THE FAIRY WISH.,"insult to himself. Down went his head and up went his heels, and in"
1573,THE FAIRY WISH.,another minute he would have bounced right into poor Mr. Timmy Timmens'
1574,THE FAIRY WISH.,"dwelling, when one of the drivers saw him, and rushing up, gave him a"
1575,THE FAIRY WISH.,good whack with his whip. Master Bull turned round to see what was to
1576,THE FAIRY WISH.,"pay; in an instant his tail was caught in the door as I told you,"
1577,THE FAIRY WISH.,"and, frightened half out of his wits, he galloped off, dragging the"
1578,THE FAIRY WISH.,"little house on wheels after him, and roaring with pain, while the"
1579,THE FAIRY WISH.,"drivers looked on, roaring with laughter."
1580,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1581,THE FAIRY WISH.,[Illustration: THE MAD BULL.]
1582,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1583,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Meanwhile, the little old man remained standing on one leg, not daring"
1584,THE FAIRY WISH.,"to open his eyes, for fear the charm would be broken, and only wishing"
1585,THE FAIRY WISH.,"that the little old woman were with him. At last the house stopped,"
1586,THE FAIRY WISH.,"moving with another jerk, that sent the little old man toppling back in"
1587,THE FAIRY WISH.,"his rocking chair, and a moment afterward the door was opened a little"
1588,THE FAIRY WISH.,"bit, and a strange voice said, ""Well, here we are at the village, old"
1589,THE FAIRY WISH.,"gentleman, begging your pardon,"" and then all was silent."
1590,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1591,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Up jumped the little old man, opening his eyes very wide this time,"
1592,THE FAIRY WISH.,"hobbled to the door, and looked out. There, sure enough, he was, in the"
1593,THE FAIRY WISH.,"pleasant, shady village street, with the church directly opposite, so"
1594,THE FAIRY WISH.,"nice for Sundays, and nothing to be seen but a drove of cows and oxen"
1595,THE FAIRY WISH.,going down the road at some distance!
1596,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1597,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Well, was there ever anything known like this?"" cried Mr. Timmy"
1598,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Timmens. ""If this isn't the most wonderful fairy doings I ever heard of!"
1599,THE FAIRY WISH.,"I must go right off to find Polly, and tell her the happy news."""
1600,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1601,THE FAIRY WISH.,"So saying, he went down the bright yellow steps, carefully shut the"
1602,THE FAIRY WISH.,"bright blue door behind him, and toddled off as fast as he could to the"
1603,THE FAIRY WISH.,common.
1604,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1605,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Now the little old woman, before she had finished digging up the"
1606,THE FAIRY WISH.,"potatuses, found the sun very warm and herself very sleepy, and thinking"
1607,THE FAIRY WISH.,"her husband would be sure to call her when twelve o'clock came, she just"
1608,THE FAIRY WISH.,"got under the shade of the tomatuses, and went off in a nice nap. When"
1609,THE FAIRY WISH.,"she woke, she jumped up in a hurry, exclaiming, ""Why, bless me--how"
1610,THE FAIRY WISH.,could I have forgotten about twelve o'clock? I must make haste into the
1611,THE FAIRY WISH.,"house this minute."" But where was the house? The little old woman stared"
1612,THE FAIRY WISH.,"all around until she nearly stared her eyes out, but it was nowhere to"
1613,THE FAIRY WISH.,be seen.
1614,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1615,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Why, my goodness gracious, stars, and what's-his-names!"" squealed the"
1616,THE FAIRY WISH.,"little old woman, letting fall her knife and basket; ""where has the"
1617,THE FAIRY WISH.,house runned to? Timmy must have tried the fairy charm without ever
1618,THE FAIRY WISH.,"telling me! I mean to go right to the village and see if it is there."""
1619,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1620,THE FAIRY WISH.,"So she gathered up her basket and knife, stuffed the basket, and her"
1621,THE FAIRY WISH.,"apron, and her pockets with all the vegetables she could carry, and"
1622,THE FAIRY WISH.,"started off for the village. Before she was half way there, however, she"
1623,THE FAIRY WISH.,"met her husband. ""Where is it?"" ""There it is!"" they called at the same"
1624,THE FAIRY WISH.,"moment, and falling into each other's arms and a mud puddle, they stood"
1625,THE FAIRY WISH.,"for a long time, saying by turns: ""Did you ever?"" ""No, I never!"" ""Would"
1626,THE FAIRY WISH.,"you believe it?"" ""Not 'less I see'd it!"" and then they took hold of"
1627,THE FAIRY WISH.,hands and trotted off to the little house that ran on wheels.
1628,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1629,THE FAIRY WISH.,"There they found it, all high and dry, under a big apple tree, looking"
1630,THE FAIRY WISH.,"as nice as ninepence. With joyful hearts they hurried inside, picked up"
1631,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the saucepans, and cooked all the tomatuses and potatuses for dinner,"
1632,THE FAIRY WISH.,"with an apple dumpling for dessert, made of some of the apples that had"
1633,THE FAIRY WISH.,"fallen off the tree; and after that, the little old man and the little"
1634,THE FAIRY WISH.,"old woman, and the bright green blinds, and the bright red walls, and"
1635,THE FAIRY WISH.,"the bright blue door with the bright brass knocker, and the bright"
1636,THE FAIRY WISH.,"yellow steps, all lived in peace and the middle of the village,"
1637,THE FAIRY WISH.,"believing more firmly than ever in the existence of fairies, and never"
1638,THE FAIRY WISH.,doubting that their house had been moved solely by the miraculous power
1639,THE FAIRY WISH.,"of the fairy spell,"
1640,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1641,THE FAIRY WISH.,"""Rorum corum torum snorum,"
1642,THE FAIRY WISH.,"Highcum tickleme cockolorum!"""
1643,THE FAIRY WISH.,
1644,THE FAIRY WISH.,And if they're not dead they live there still! Don't you believe it?
1645,THE FAIRY WISH.,Well I NEVER did!
