106,PART I.,"Where are your berries, child?"
107,PART I.,"You cannot, sure, have sold them all,"
108,PART I.,"You had a basket pil'd."""
109,PART I.,
110,PART I.,"""No, mother, as I climb'd the fence,"
111,PART I.,"The nearest way to town,"
112,PART I.,"My apron caught upon a stake,"
113,PART I.,"And so I tumbled down."""
114,PART I.,
115,PART I.,"""I scratched my arm, and tore my hair,"
116,PART I.,But still did not complain;
117,PART I.,"And had my blackberries been safe,"
118,PART I.,Should not have cared a grain.

121,PART I.,
122,PART I.,"""But when I saw them on the ground"
123,PART I.,"All scattered by my side,"
124,PART I.,"I pick'd my empty basket up,"
125,PART I.,And down I sat and cried.
126,PART I.,
127,PART I.,"""Just then a pretty little Miss"
128,PART I.,Chanced to be walking by;
129,PART I.,"She stopp'd, and looking pitiful,"
130,PART I.,She begg'd me not to cry.
131,PART I.,
132,PART I.,"""'Poor little girl, you fell,' said she,"
133,PART I.,'And must be sadly hurt'--
134,PART I.,"'O, no,' I cried, 'but see my fruit,"
135,PART I.,All mixed with sand and dirt!'
136,PART I.,
137,PART I.,"""'Well, do not grieve for that,' she said:"
138,PART I.,"'Go home, and get some more:'"
139,PART I.,"Ah, no, for I have stripp'd the vines,"
140,PART I.,These were the last they bore.
141,PART I.,
142,PART I.,"""My father, Miss, is very poor,"
143,PART I.,And works in yonder stall;
144,PART I.,
145,PART I.,"He has so many little ones,"
146,PART I.,He cannot clothe us all.
147,PART I.,
148,PART I.,"""I always long'd to go to church,"
149,PART I.,But never could I go;
150,PART I.,"For when I ask'd him for a gown,"
151,PART I.,"He always answer'd, 'No.'"
152,PART I.,
153,PART I.,"""'There's not a father in the world"
154,PART I.,That loves his children more;
155,PART I.,"I'd get you one with all my heart,"

157,PART I.,
158,PART I.,"""But when the blackberries were ripe"
159,PART I.,"He said to me one day,"
160,PART I.,"'Phebe, if you will take the time"
161,PART I.,"That's given you for play,"
162,PART I.,
163,PART I.,"""And gather blackberries enough,--"
164,PART I.,"And carry them to town,--"
165,PART I.,"To buy your bonnet and your shoes,"
166,PART I.,I'll try to get a gown.'

169,PART I.,
170,PART I.,"""O Miss, I fairly jumped for joy,"
171,PART I.,My spirits were so light:
172,PART I.,"And so, when I had leave to play,"
173,PART I.,I pick'd with all my might.
174,PART I.,
175,PART I.,"""I sold enough to get my shoes,"
176,PART I.,About a week ago;
177,PART I.,"And these, if they had not been spilt,"
178,PART I.,Would buy a bonnet too.
179,PART I.,
180,PART I.,"""But now they are gone, they all are gone,"
181,PART I.,"And I can get no more,"
182,PART I.,And Sundays I must stay at home
183,PART I.,Just as I did before.
184,PART I.,
185,PART I.,"""And, mother, then. I cried again,"
186,PART I.,As hard as I could cry;
187,PART I.,"And, looking up, I saw a tear"
188,PART I.,Was standing in her eye.
189,PART I.,
190,PART I.,"""She caught her bonnet from her head--"
191,PART I.,"'Here, here,' she cried, 'take this!'"
192,PART I.,
193,PART I.,"O, no, indeed--I fear your 'ma"
194,PART I.,"Would be offended, Miss."
195,PART I.,
196,PART I.,[Illustration]
197,PART I.,
198,PART I.,"""'My 'ma! no, never! she delights"
199,PART I.,All sorrow to beguile;
200,PART I.,"And 'tis the sweetest joy she feels,"
201,PART I.,To make the wretched smile.
202,PART I.,
203,PART I.,"""'She taught me when I had enough,"
204,PART I.,To share it with the poor:
205,PART I.,And never let a needy child
206,PART I.,Go empty from the door.
207,PART I.,
208,PART I.,[Illustration: The Church the Blackberry Girl went to.]
209,PART I.,
210,PART I.,"""'So take it, for you need not fear"
211,PART I.,"Offending her, you see;"
212,PART I.,"I have another, too, at home,"
213,PART I.,And one's enough for me.'
214,PART I.,
215,PART I.,"""So then I took it,--here it is--"
216,PART I.,For pray what could I do?
217,PART I.,"And, mother, I shall love that Miss"
218,PART I.,"As long as I love you."""

234,PART II.,They're very large and fully ripe;
235,PART II.,"Do look at them, and taste them pray."""
236,PART II.,
237,PART II.,"""O yes: they're very nice, indeed."
238,PART II.,Here's fourpence--that will buy a few:
239,PART II.,Not quite so many as I want--
240,PART II.,"However, I must make it do."""
241,PART II.,
242,PART II.,"""Nay, Miss, but you must take the whole;"""
243,PART II.,"""I can't, indeed, my money's spent;"
244,PART II.,"I should he glad to buy them all,"

255,PART II.,That little girl remember you.
256,PART II.,
257,PART II.,"""And ever since, I've been to church,"
258,PART II.,For much do I delight to go;
259,PART II.,And there I learn that works of love
260,PART II.,Are what all children ought to do.
261,PART II.,
262,PART II.,"""So then I thought within myself,"
263,PART II.,"That pretty basket, Billy wove,"
264,PART II.,"I'll fill with fruit for tha dear Miss,"
265,PART II.,For sure 'twill be a work of love.

269,PART II.,
270,PART II.,"And pick'd the nicest I could find,"
271,PART II.,"And brought them, fresh and sweet, for you."
272,PART II.,
273,PART II.,"""I know the gift is small indeed,"
274,PART II.,For such a lady to receive;
275,PART II.,But still I hope you'll not refuse
276,PART II.,"All that poor Phebe has to give."""

360,THE PET LAMB.,"I heard a voice: it said, Drink, pretty creature,"
361,THE PET LAMB.,drink!
362,THE PET LAMB.,"And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied"
363,THE PET LAMB.,A snow-white mountain Lamb with a maiden at its
364,THE PET LAMB.,side.
365,THE PET LAMB.,
366,THE PET LAMB.,"No other sheep were near; the Lamb was all alone,"
367,THE PET LAMB.,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;
368,THE PET LAMB.,With one knee on the grass did the little maiden
369,THE PET LAMB.,"kneel,"
370,THE PET LAMB.,While to that mountain Lamb she gave its evening
371,THE PET LAMB.,meal.
372,THE PET LAMB.,
373,THE PET LAMB.,"The Lamb, while from her hand he thus his"

375,THE PET LAMB.,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail
376,THE PET LAMB.,with pleasure shook.
377,THE PET LAMB.,"Drink, pretty creature, drink, she said in such a tone"

385,THE PET LAMB.,But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she
386,THE PET LAMB.,stay.
387,THE PET LAMB.,
388,THE PET LAMB.,Towards the Lamb she looked; and from that
389,THE PET LAMB.,shady place
390,THE PET LAMB.,I unobserved could see the workings of her face;
391,THE PET LAMB.,If nature to her tongue could measured numbers
392,THE PET LAMB.,"bring,"
393,THE PET LAMB.,"Thus, thought I, to her Lamb that little maid"

406,THE PET LAMB.,thy heart?
407,THE PET LAMB.,Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful
408,THE PET LAMB.,thou art:
409,THE PET LAMB.,This grass is tender grass; these flowers they

447,THE PET LAMB.,"I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and"
448,THE PET LAMB.,new.
449,THE PET LAMB.,
450,THE PET LAMB.,Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they

455,THE PET LAMB.,My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is

462,THE PET LAMB.,"It will not, will not rest! poor creature, can it be"

464,THE PET LAMB.,thee?
465,THE PET LAMB.,"Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,"
466,THE PET LAMB.,And dreams of things which thou canst neither see

468,THE PET LAMB.,
469,THE PET LAMB.,"Alas, the mountain tops that look so green and"
470,THE PET LAMB.,fair!
471,THE PET LAMB.,I've heard of fearful winds and darkness that come
472,THE PET LAMB.,there:
473,THE PET LAMB.,
474,THE PET LAMB.,"The little brooks that seem all pastime and at play,"
475,THE PET LAMB.,"When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey."
476,THE PET LAMB.,
477,THE PET LAMB.,Here thou need'st not dread the raven in the sky;

480,THE PET LAMB.,Why bleat so after me? why pull so at thy chain?
481,THE PET LAMB.,Sleep--and at break of day I will come to thee
482,THE PET LAMB.,again.
483,THE PET LAMB.,
484,THE PET LAMB.,As homeward through the lane I went with lazy
485,THE PET LAMB.,"feet,"
486,THE PET LAMB.,This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat;
487,THE PET LAMB.,"And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line,"
488,THE PET LAMB.,"That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was"
489,THE PET LAMB.,mine.
490,THE PET LAMB.,
491,THE PET LAMB.,"Again, and once again, did I repeat the song;"
492,THE PET LAMB.,"Nay, said I, more than half to the damsel must"

963,CASABIANCA,"The boy--O, where was he?"
964,CASABIANCA,"Ask of the winds, that far around"
965,CASABIANCA,With fragments strewed the sea--
966,CASABIANCA,
967,CASABIANCA,"With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,"
968,CASABIANCA,That well had borne their part;
969,CASABIANCA,But the noblest thing that perished there
970,CASABIANCA,Was that young faithful heart.
