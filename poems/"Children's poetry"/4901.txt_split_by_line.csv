20,,Introduction.

24,,
25,,The editor of the new edition of Mother Goose's Melodies knows much
26,,more about the curious history of the Boston edition than I do.  And
27,,"the reader will not need, even in these lines of mine, any light"
28,,"on the curious question about Madam Vergoose, or her son-in-law"
29,,"Mr. Fleet, or the Contes de Ma Mere l'Oye, which are so carefully"
30,,discussed in the preface.  All this is admirably discussed
31,,"also in Mr. William Whitmore's paper published in Albany in 1889,"
32,,and reprinted in Boston in 1892.  In that paper he reproduced in
33,,facsimile Isaiah Thomas's edition of Mother Goose published first
34,,in 1785.
35,,
36,,"What I want to tell, is of Mother Goose in the nineteenth Century--the"
37,,Mother Goose on which the old Boston line was brought up--a line
38,,"now nearly forgotten.  But there were days, Gentle Reader, when an"
39,,excellent body of people in this little Town of Boston grew up all
40,,"together loving and loved, brought up their children here, loving"
41,,"and loved, and amused those children from babyhood in their own"
42,,way.  The centre of the baby life of this race was Mother Goose's
43,,"Melodies in the dear little quarto edition, of which a precise copy"
44,,is in the reader's hands.
45,,
46,,"It is this Mother Goose of which the New Englander, if his age be"
47,,"more than three score years and ten, speaks when he speaks of Mother"
48,,Goose at all.  The historical ear marks in it are rather curious.
49,,Perhaps the printing of this very edition may raise up some antiquary
50,,who can tell us how it came into existence.  I wish I knew.  I hope
51,,"some reader of these lines may know.  What I know is this, that"
52,,"when the nineteenth century began, in the years from 1800 to 1820,"
53,,"the impression of what we still called the ""Mother Country"" upon"
54,,Boston was very strong.  The old nurse who took care of me in my
55,,"babyhood spoke of ""weal"" and ""winegar,"" where my father and mother"
56,,"spoke of veal and vinegar, just as if she had been a London Cockney."
57,,"Children played the games of English origin,"
58,,
59,,
60,,"""Lady Queen Anne, she sits on her throne,"""
61,,
62,,
63,,though it were fifty years after the Declaration of Independence.
64,,"I may say in passing, that within the last dozen years I stopped"
65,,"to hear some North End children sing the song Queen Anne, without"
66,,"the slightest idea, I suppose, of who Queen Anne was, or what was"
67,,"their business with her.  Alas, and alas, I did not write down the"
68,,words of that song on the moment!
69,,
70,,The truth is that Boston was still a place of foreign commerce.
71,,"Our ties with London, such as John Adams and other Revolutionaries"
72,,"spoke of so freely, still existed, and a Baby's Song Book like"
73,,"Mother Goose, might still recall, and I suppose repeat, the song"
74,,of Cockney homes.
75,,
76,,"So in the nursery, whether one of the North End sailors' home, or"
77,,"of Beacon Street, or Park Street, or Pearl Street, the baby was"
78,,sung to sleep with London ditties.
79,,
80,,
81,,"London Bridge is broken down,"
82,,"Dance over, my Lady Lee,"
83,,"London Bridge is broken down,"
84,,With a fair Ladye.
85,,Will not some of the active literary clubs of St. Ethelburger's
86,,"Church in Bishopsgate, in East London, tell us what this means:"
87,,
88,,
89,,"You owe me five shillings,"
90,,Say the bells of St. Helen's.
91,,When will you pay me?
92,,Say the bells of Old Bailey.
93,,"When I grow rich,"
94,,Say the bells of Shoreditch.
95,,"Pokers and tongs,"
96,,Say the bells of St. John's.
97,,"Kettles and pans,"
98,,Say the bells of St. Ann's.
99,,"Half-pence and farthings,"
100,,Say the bells of St. Martin's.
101,,
102,,
103,,"All this was sung to New England children, thank God without note"
104,,"or comment, and with no other explanation.  But the American traveler"
105,,"who goes into Baring Brothers', Bishopsgate, with his credit, feels"
106,,"a thrill which the clerk who attends to him does not understand,"
107,,if one speaks to him of St. Helen's or St. Ann's.
108,,
109,,All this accounts for Mother Goose as Fleet reprinted her baby songs
110,,"as early as the year 1700.  But as the reader will see, somebody"
111,,had the editing of the baby's text book who was not afraid of his
112,,own time.  I think that the very latest verses which will be found
113,,here are those of Scott's Donald Dhu.  Walter Scott wrote this
114,,for Campbell's Anthology in 1816.  The presence of these verses
115,,"fixes the latest date of any lines in the collection, except, as"
116,,"Mr. Whitmore has observed, the line ""Boston Town"" is changed into"
117,,"""Boston City,"" so that must have been written after 1822."
118,,
119,,But it is interesting to see that no American line of comment seems
120,,"to have slipped in.  There was no lack of nationalism in the air,"
121,,"but I cannot find any reference to a cent[*], a dime, a governor,"
122,,"or a President.  Now in the printed handkerchiefs, such as children"
123,,"used to buy on Election Day in the street, I remember the Ballad"
124,,"of John Gilpin ended,"
125,,
126,,
127,,"Now, let us sing, ""Long live the President"
128,,"And Gilpin, Long live he."""
129,,But the wise editor of our Boston Mother Goose had no such fears
130,,for the republicanism of his baby hearers.  Those were happy years
131,,in which the imagination of babies and their older brothers and
132,,sisters were permitted to run free.
133,,
134,,"[*][Note from Brett:  See the rhyme which starts ""Little Jack"
135,,"Nory..."" for such a reference.]"
136,,
137,,"I have asked and asked and have received no answer, as to the artist"
138,,who made many of the admirable designs which are distinctive in
139,,"this book.  Abel Bowen's[*] name is signed to one, and his initials"
140,,appear on several.  N.D. means Nathaniel Dearborn[+].  One is signed
141,,"""Chicket,""[&] but this does not account for the greater number"
142,,"of them.  I was the son of a printer and type-founder, so we had"
143,,"a ""type book"" as a classic in our nursery.  So I knew even as a"
144,,"little child, that there were pictures in Mother Goose which were"
145,,put there merely because the block from which they were printed
146,,existed in the printer's office.  But there were other designs made
147,,by some artist of genius; and who was he?  He represented the man
148,,"in the moon, hanging with one arm to the crescent of the moon.  That"
149,,"man, whoever he was, is to be ranked among the original artists of"
150,,the world.  He gave to childhood his first and best images of the
151,,blackbirds who were baked in the pie.
152,,
153,,[*][Note from Brett:  Abel Bowen (1790-1850) was Boston's first
154,,wood engraver and is perhaps most well known for his work on the
155,,"""Farmer's Almanac.""]"
156,,
157,,[+][Note from Brett:  Nathanial Dearborn (1786-1852) was with the
158,,Holland Printing Company and is perhaps most well known (in 2002)
159,,for the difficulty he had in setting plates for a 13 cent stamp
160,,used in Hawaii (second issue).  He also was a printer and author
161,,"of ""The American Textbook for Making Letters.""  He would have been"
162,,well remembered in Boston at the time of this book.]
163,,
164,,"[&][Note from Brett:  ""Chicket"" is terribly obscure and the"
165,,only reference I could possibly find was to a Mr. Chicket who was
166,,"apparently murdered in a bar (the Brushmakers Arms) in Upham, New"
167,,Hampshire and supposedly haunts the bar.  Whether this has anything
168,,"to do with the Chicket in the text is highly questionable, but"
169,,would make for a great story.]
170,,
171,,"This question I have asked again and again, and no man and no woman"
172,,has answered it.  But the chances seem to be that we owe them also
173,,"to Abel Bowen, the first wood engraver recorded among the engravers"
174,,in the period after the Revolution.  We have specimens of his work
175,,more in pictures of landscape or of buildings than in drawings of
176,,men and women.  But there can be but little doubt that most of the
177,,blocks from which the Mother Goose of our childhood were printed
178,,"were engraved by him, and there seems to be good reason to believe"
179,,that the designs were by him as well.  The pity is that no old
180,,"portfolio can be found with other designs from his pencil.  But,"
181,,"alas, the chances are that they have gone where so many other"
182,,"manuscripts have gone, which would delight the antiquaries."
183,,
184,,"Thanks to the publisher and editor of this book, the designs, of"
185,,"whatever hand, are now preserved for another generation."
186,,
187,,I have said that I am not learned in the interesting genealogical
188,,"discussion of the subject, but I like to call attention to the fact"
189,,"that the English Norwich was the birthplace and home of Fleet, and"
190,,that it is possible that in the annals of that city light may be
191,,gained as to the history of the man in the Moon.
192,,
193,,I have always thoughtt that the close connection of our maritime
194,,people with London had something to do with the names of our streets.
195,,"The most striking instance is in the name of Cornhill, where this"
196,,"very Thomas Fleet had his book store, and where book stores have"
197,,been an institution from that day to this.  Our Cornhill in its
198,,relations to our water front occupies the same conditions which
199,,the London Cornhill had and has to the river front in London.  The
200,,young reader should remember that Washington Street so far as it had
201,,one name was called the Main Street.  Coming North from our Dover
202,,"Street, the traveler passed through Orange Street, then through"
203,,"Newbury Street, next through Marlborough Street, which extended"
204,,"from Winter Street to School Street, and then through Cornhill"
205,,northward to Dock Square.  This is precisely as in passing east
206,,"through what was the Main Street of London of those days, the traveler"
207,,would have passed through the Cornhill of that thoroughfare.  The
208,,London Cornhill retains its name.  Ours was changed in 1824 to the
209,,"all-conquering name of Washington, which is now applied to the whole"
210,,"of the ""Main Street"" and ""the Neck"" of the Fathers, as indeed, it"
211,,is applied by local authorities many miles further.
212,,
213,,"But in familiar conversation, the old name Cornhill was retained"
214,,"for a generation, and indeed, would be understood to-day, if you"
215,,were speaking to Boston people more than fifty years old.  The name
216,,Cornhill is now applied to the Market Street of an earlier period.
217,,
218,,"Young readers should remember that Orange Street, Newbury street,"
219,,and Marlborough Street were names given in honour of the Prince
220,,"of Orange of the Puritan victory at Newbury, and of the Duke"
221,,of Marlborough.  All of them show what were the Whig and Puritan
222,,feelings of the people who gave them.  All three of the names in
223,,our time have been transferred from the old localities.
224,,
225,,We are all greatly obliged to Mrs. Harriet Blackstone C. Butler for
226,,the pains she has taken to rescue for popular use this interesting
227,,memorial of the education of the fathers and mothers of New England.

292,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
293,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
294,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"MR. EDITOR:--Your correspondent, N.B.S., has so decisively given"
295,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"a QUIETUS to the question as to the birthplace of Cotton Mather,"
296,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],that there is no danger of its ever being revived again.  But there
297,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"is another question of equal importance to many, to the literary"
298,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"world in particular, which should in like manner be put to rest."
299,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],WHO WAS MOTHER GOOSE? and WHEN were her melodies first given to the
300,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"world?  These are questions which have been often asked, but have"
301,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],never been satisfactorily answered.  The recent publication of a
302,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"book called ""Mother Goose for Old Folks"" has again revived these"
303,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"questions, which serves to show that the subject has not yet lost"
304,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],its interest.
305,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
306,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Many persons imagine that Mother Goose is a myth,--that no such"
307,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],person ever existed.  This is a mistake.  MOTHER GOOSE was not
308,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"only a veritable personage, but was born and resided many years in"
309,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Boston, where many of her descendants may now be found.  The last"
310,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"that bore this ancient paternal cognomen died about the year 1807,"
311,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"and was buried in the Old Granary Burying Ground, where probably lie"
312,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"the remains of the whole blood, if we may judge from the numerous"
313,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],grave-stones which mark their resting place.  The family originated in
314,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"England, but at what time they came to this country is unknown,--but"
315,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"probably about the year 1656.  This was the ""Wealthy family of"
316,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Goose"" which is immortalized by Mr. Bowditch in his book of Suffolk"
317,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Names, who at the same time has immortalized himself.  They were"
318,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"landholders in Boston, so early as 1660.  Nearly half the space"
319,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"between West and Winter streets, on Washington street, and extending"
320,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"westerly towards Tremont street, 275 feet belonged to this family,"
321,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"as did also a large tract of land on Essex, Rowe, and Bedford"
322,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"streets, upon which now stand two churches and a large number of"
323,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],dwelling houses.  SO MUCH FOR MOTHER GOOSE.  Now for her melodies.
324,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
325,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],It is well known to antiquarians that more than TWO hundred years
326,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],ago there was a small book in circulation in London bearing the
327,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"name of ""Rhymes for the nursery; or Lulla-Byes for Children,"" which"
328,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],contained MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES which have been handed down
329,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"to us and now from part of the ""Mother Goose's Melodies"" of the"
330,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"present day.  It contained also other pieces much more silly, if"
331,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"possible, and some that the AMERICAN types of the present day would"
332,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"refuse to give off an impression.  The ""cuts"" or illustrations"
333,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],thereof were of the coarsest description.
334,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
335,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],The first book of the kind known to be printed in this country bears
336,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"the title of ""Songs for the Nursery; or, Mother Goose's Melodies"
337,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"for Children.""  Something probably intended to represent a goose"
338,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"with a very long neck and mouth wide open, covered a large part"

347,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"presumed author.  Unfortunately, modern research and research at"
348,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],the time failed to substantiate the existence of this book.  This
349,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],information is culled in part from the introduction to L. Frank
350,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Baum's edition of ""Mother Goose"" in 1897.  The introduction written"

353,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],
354,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"This T. Fleet, according to Isaiah Thomas[*], was a man of considerable"
355,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"talent and of great wit and humor.  He was born in England, and"
356,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"was brought up in a printing office in the city of Bristol, where"
357,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],he afterwards worked as a journeyman.  Although he was considered
358,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"a man of sense, he was never thought to be overburdened with"
359,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],religious sentiments; he certainly was not in his latter days.  Yet
360,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],he was MORE than suspected of being actively engaged in the riotous
361,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"proceedings connected with the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, in Queen"
362,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Ann's time.  In London, Bristol, and many other places, the mobs"
363,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],and riots were of a very serious nature.  In London several meeting
364,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"houses were sacked and pulled down, and the materials and contents"
365,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"made into bonfires, and much valuable property destroyed.  Several"
366,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"of the rioters were arrested, tried and convicted.  The trials of"
367,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],some of them are now before me.  How deeply Fleet was implicated
368,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"in these disturbances was never known, but being of the same mind"
369,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"with Jack Falstaff, that ""the better part of valor is discretion,"""
370,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],thought it prudent to put the Ocean between himself and danger.  He
371,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"made his way to this country and arrived in Boston, 1712.  Being"
372,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],a man of some enterprise he soon established a printing office in
373,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street), where he printed small books,"
374,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"pamphlets, ballads, and such matter as offered.  Being industrious"
375,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"and prudent, he gradually accumulated property.  It was not long"
376,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"before he became acquainted with the ""wealthy family of Goose,"""
377,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],"a branch of which he had before known in Bristol, and was shortly"
378,[FROM THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.],married to the eldest daughter.
