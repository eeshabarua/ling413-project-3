69,THE DYING BOY.,"A little boy, by the name of Bertie, was taken very ill, and for"
70,THE DYING BOY.,sometime continued to grow weaker until he died. A few hours before his
71,THE DYING BOY.,"death he revived up, and his first request was, to be bathed in the"
72,THE DYING BOY.,"river; but his mother persuaded him to be sponged only, as the river"
73,THE DYING BOY.,water would be too cold for his weak frame. After his mother had sponged
74,THE DYING BOY.,"him with water, he desired to be dressed; when his mother dressed him in"
75,THE DYING BOY.,"his green coat and white collar, and seated him at the table with all"
76,THE DYING BOY.,"his books and worldly treasures around him. As he sat there, one would"
77,THE DYING BOY.,have thought that he was about to commence a course of study; and yet in
78,THE DYING BOY.,"the marble paleness of his features, and in the listless and languid"
79,THE DYING BOY.,"eye, there was evidence that life in the boy was like an expiring taper,"
80,THE DYING BOY.,flickering in the socket. He soon asked to go out in his little
81,THE DYING BOY.,"carriage. His grandfather, whom he very much loved, placed him in it,"
82,THE DYING BOY.,"and carefully avoiding every stone, drew him to a spot commanding the"
83,THE DYING BOY.,"entire landscape. The tide was up, and the sun was shining on the deep"
84,THE DYING BOY.,"blue waters, and bathing the distant mountains and the green meadows in"
85,THE DYING BOY.,liquid gold. The gardens and orchards around were gay in the rich
86,THE DYING BOY.,crimson blossoms of the apple tree; the air was filled with the sweet
87,THE DYING BOY.,"fragrance of flowers, and the birds were singing beautifully, when"
88,THE DYING BOY.,little Bertie looked for the last time on the scenes of earth. He could
89,THE DYING BOY.,"not remain long, and was soon taken back to the little parlor, where he"
90,THE DYING BOY.,"sat on the sofa, resting his elbows on the table. It was not long before"
91,THE DYING BOY.,the little boy died. But he was very happy. Among his last words were
92,THE DYING BOY.,"these, addressed to his little sister three years old: ""Well, Emmie,"
93,THE DYING BOY.,"very ill--me going to Jesus."" ""Oh, mamma, Emmie loves her Saviour."""

101,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,A bright eyed boy was sleeping upon a bank of blossoming clover. The
102,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"cool breeze lifted the curls from his brow, and fanned with downy wings"
103,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"his quiet slumbers, while he lay under the refreshing shade of a large"
104,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,maple tree. The birds sang to him during his happy hours of sleep. By
105,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"and by he awoke, and a beautiful gold robin sat on the spray, and sung"
106,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"a song of joy. The boy reached out his hands to secure the prize, but"
107,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,the robin spread his golden wings and soared away. He looked after it
108,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"with a longing gaze, and when it disappeared from his sight, he wept"
109,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"aloud. At this moment, a form of light approached, and took the hands of"
110,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,the child and pointed upwards; and he saw the bird soaring in freedom
111,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,and the sun shining upon its burnished plumes. Then the shining one
112,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"said; ""Do you love that beautiful bird?"" In the midst of his tears the"
113,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"child replied, ""Oh, yes."" ""Then,"" said the angel, ""shall it not wing its"
114,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"flight from flower to flower and be happy, rather than to dwell in a"
115,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"prison with thee?"" Then the streams and flowering vales of Elysium, that"
116,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"breathe the pure air of freedom, spake: ""Wouldst thou bring her back to"
117,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"thee, and make her a prisoner? Dry up thy tears, and let thy song be,"
118,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"'Stay not here, but speed thy flight, O bright one, and snuff the"
119,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,mellow air of freedom.' God made the birds to be happy in their short
120,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"existence, and ought we to deprive them of their own elements of"
121,THE BOY AND THE GOLD ROBIN.,"happiness, and take from them the freedom which they enjoy?"""

129,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"A little girl, by the name of Sarah Dean, was taught the precepts of the"

131,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,to show her some plums that a friend had given her. The mother said to
132,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"her: ""Your friend was very kind, and has given you a great many."" ""Yes,"""
133,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"replied Sarah, ""she was, and she gave me more than these, but I have"
134,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"given some away."" The mother asked to whom she had given them; when the"
135,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"child replied: ""I gave them to a girl that pushes me off the path, and"
136,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"makes faces at me."" Upon being asked why she gave them to her, she"
137,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"answered: ""Because I thought that would make her know that I wished to"
138,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"be kind to her, and perhaps she will not be unkind and rude to me"
139,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"again."" This was true. The rude girl was afterwards very good to Sarah,"
140,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,and felt very sorry that she had treated her unkindly. How truly did the
141,THE WAY TO OVERCOME EVIL.,"little girl obey the command, ""_overcome evil with good_."""

149,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"It was on a Sabbath eve, when at a friend's house, we were all sitting"
150,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"in the piazza, conversing about the efforts which were being made for"
151,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"the poor heathen, and the number of Testaments which were being sent to"
152,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,them.
153,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
154,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Father,"" said little Harriet, ""do the little heathen children wish to"
155,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"learn to read the New Testament?"""
156,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
157,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""O yes, my child, many of them do,"" said the father. ""But have they all"
158,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"got Testaments if they did know how to read?"" ""No, my love; few of them"
159,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"have ever heard about the Testament, about God, or about Jesus Christ."""
160,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Will half a dollar buy one?"" said Harriet. ""O yes, my child."""
161,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
162,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Then,"" said Harriet, ""may I sell anything I have, if I can get the"

164,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
165,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"Now, every child has some favorite toy. Harriet's was a beautiful tame"
166,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"_gray_ squirrel. It would eat from her hands, attend her in her rambles,"
167,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"and sleep on her pillow. She called its name Jenny. It was taken sick,"
168,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"and the little girl nursed it with care, but it at last died in her lap."
169,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
170,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"Little Harriet wept sadly about it, and her father tried to console"
171,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"her, and told her not to feel so."
172,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,
173,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"""Ah,"" said she, ""you know, father, you told me that I might sell"
174,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"anything I had to buy a Testament for the heathen children, and I was"
175,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"going to sell my pretty squirrel to Mr. Smith, who said he would give me"
176,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"half a dollar for it; but now my Jenny is dead."" The Father then put a"
177,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,"silver dollar into Harriet's hand, and she dried her tears, rejoicing"
178,HARRIET AND HER SQUIRREL.,that Jenny's death would be the means of his little daughter having two

193,THE REWARD.,"""Mamma, if I had told a lie to-day, I would have got a catechism."""
194,THE REWARD.,
195,THE REWARD.,"""I think that very strange, Eliza; for the Sabbath School is no place"

198,THE REWARD.,
199,THE REWARD.,"""Mother,"" said Eliza, ""I tell nothing but the truth; and now I will"

205,THE REWARD.,"were I would not look at my old one any more. Our teacher asked us all,"
206,THE REWARD.,"when we went in, if we had any catechisms, and those who said they had"
207,THE REWARD.,"not, received one from the teacher as a present. Jane, after all she"
208,THE REWARD.,"told me, by the way, denied that she had any, and Lizzy did the same."
209,THE REWARD.,"But when he asked me, I told him I had one at home; but if I had said"

396,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"Early in the morning, before it was light, and while the twilight"
397,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"gleamed through the curtainless windows, Lettice was up, dressing"
398,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,herself by the aid of the light which gleamed from the street lamp into

400,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"draw with much precaution, lest she should disturb poor Myra, who still"
401,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,slumbered on the hard mattress--drew out a shawl and began to fold it as
402,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,if to put it on.
403,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
404,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"""Alas!"" said Lettice, ""this will not do--it is threadbare, timeworn, and"
405,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"has given way in two places."" She turned it, and unfolded it, but it"
406,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,would not do. It was so shabby that she was actually ashamed to be seen
407,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"with it in the street. She put it aside, and took the liberty of"
408,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"borrowing Myra's, who was now asleep. She knew Myra would be awful cold"
409,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"when she got up, and would need it. But she must go with the work that"
410,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"morning. She thought first of preparing the fire, so that Myra, when she"
411,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"arose, would only have to light the match; but as she went to the box"
412,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"for coal she saw, with terror, how low the little store of fuel was, and"
413,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"she said to herself, ""we must have a bushel of coal to-day--better do"
414,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"without meat than fire such weather as this."" But she was cheered with"
415,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,the reflection that she should receive a little more for her work that
416,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,day than what she had from other places. It had been ordered by a
417,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,benevolent lady who had been to some trouble in getting the poor women
418,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,supplied with needle work so that they should receive the full price.
419,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"She had worked for private customers before, and always received more"
420,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"pay from them than from the shops in London, where they would beat down"
421,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,the poor to the last penny.
422,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
423,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,Poor Lettice went to the old band-box and took out a shabby old
424,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"bonnet--she looked at it, and sighed, when she thought of the appearance"
425,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"she must make; for she was going to Mrs. Danvers, and her work was some"
426,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,very nice linen for a young lady about to be married.
427,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
428,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"Just at this moment she thought of the contrast, between all the fine"
429,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"things which that young lady was to have, and her own destitution. But"
430,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,her disposition was such as not to cause her to think hard of others who
431,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,had plenty while she was poor. She was contented to receive her pay from
432,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"the wealthy, for her daily needle work. She felt that what they had, was"
433,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"not taken from her, and if she could gain in her little way by"
434,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"receiving her just earnings from the general prosperity of others, she"
435,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,would not complain. And as the thought of the increased pay came into
436,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"her mind, which she was to receive that day, she brightened up, shook"
437,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"the bonnet, pulled out the ribbons and made it look as tidy as possible,"
438,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,thinking to herself that after buying some fuel she might possibly buy a
439,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"bit of ribbon and make it look a little more spruce, when she got her"
440,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,money.
441,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,
442,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"Lettice now put on her bonnet, and Myra's shawl, and looking into the"
443,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,little three-penny glass which hung on the wall she thought she might
444,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,look quite tidy after all. The young lady for whom she made the linen
445,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"lived about twenty miles from town, but she had come in about this time,"
446,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,and was to set off home at nine o'clock that very morning. The linen was
447,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"to have been sent in the night before, but Lettice had found it"
448,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,impossible to finish it. This was why she was obliged to start so early
449,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"in the morning. She now goes to the bed to tell Myra about the fire, and"
450,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"that she had borrowed her shawl, but Myra was sound asleep, so she did"
451,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,"not disturb her, but stepped lightly over the floor and down stairs, for"
452,LETTICE TAKING HOME THE WORK.,it was getting late and she must be gone. Read the next story and you

471,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"cold morning, the snow blew, and the street was slippery. She could"
472,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"scarcely stand--her face was cold, and her hands so numbed that she"

476,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"and at last entered Grosvenor Square, where the lamps were just dying"
477,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"away before the splendid houses, while the wind rushed down the Park"
478,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,colder than ever. A few boys were about the only people yet to be seen
479,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"about, and they laughed at her as she held her bonnet down with one"
480,OR THE UNEXPECTED MEETING.,"hand, to prevent its giving way before the wind, while she carried her"

594,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"for any one to do so. A horse has a good memory, and he will never"
595,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,forget a kind master. Jonas Carter is one of those boys who likes to
596,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,take care of a horse. His father gave Jonas the whole care of an
597,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,excellent animal which he purchased for his own use. Every morning he
598,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,would go into the stable to feed and water him. As all the horses in
599,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"the neighborhood had names, Jonas gave one to his, and called him Major."
600,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"Every time he went into the stable to take care of him, Major would"
601,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"whine and paw, as if his best friend was coming to see him. Jonas kept"
602,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"him very clean and nice, so that he was always ready for use at any time"
603,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"of day. At night he made up his bed of straw, and kept the stable warm"
604,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,in winter and cool in summer. Major soon found that he was in the hands
605,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"of a kind master, and being well fed, and well cleansed, he would often"
606,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"show how proud and nice he was, by playing with Jonas in the yard. His"
607,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"young master would often let him loose in the yard, and when Jonas"
608,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"started to go in, the horse, Major, would follow him to the door, and"
609,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"when he turned him into the pasture, no one could so well catch him as"
610,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"Jonas; for every time he took him from the pasture, Jonas would give"
611,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"him some oats; so when he saw his master coming for him, he remembered"
612,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"the oats, and would come directly to him. Some horses are very difficult"
613,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"to bridle, but it was not so with Major. When Jonas came with the"
614,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"bridle, Major would hold his head down, and take in his bitts, and"
615,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,appear as docile as a lamb. He well knew that Jonas never drove him
616,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"hard, but always used him kindly. Jonas was not a selfish boy; he was"
617,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,"willing to let his friends ride a short distance; and in the picture,"
618,JONAS AND HIS HORSE.,you will see him talking with one of his young friends about his horse.

633,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,Edward Ford owned a snug little cottage with a small farm situated about
634,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"a mile from the village. When he was married to Ellen G----, who was"
635,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"said to be one of the best girls in the village, he took her to his nice"
636,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"little home, where he had every thing around very pleasant and"
637,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,comfortable. Ellen was very industrious and remarkable for her prudence
638,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"and neatness. She spun and churned, and tended her poultry, and would"
639,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"often carry her butter and eggs herself to market, which greatly added"
640,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"to their comfort. She had a beautiful-little girl, and they gave her"
641,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,the name of Lily. Things glided smoothly on until Lily was sixteen.
642,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,Edward was very fond of the violin and of reading books that were not
643,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"very useful, and as he was very fond of music, he spent a great deal"
644,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,more time in making music and playing the violin than what his wife
645,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"thought profitable. Ellen loved music, and was willing to have him read"
646,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"profitable books, but all this while she thought he might be patching up"
647,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,the fences and improving the shed for the better comfort of the cattle.
648,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"Still she would not complain, hoping all the time that he would see the"
649,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"necessity of being a little more industrious. The winter came, and all"
650,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"through its dreary months he was unable to work, as he was sick. And"
651,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"although Ellen worked hard, yet her husband required so much of her"
652,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"attention, that all her efforts availed not much to keep poverty out of"
653,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"their cottage. When the spring came, Ellen's husband was able to be"
654,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"about again, and she began to hope that Edward would be more"
655,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"industrious, and they would be able by strict economy to repair the loss"
656,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"occasioned by his winter's illness, which had put them so far"
657,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,behindhand. Edward had become lazy or disheartened. Affairs about house
658,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"continued to grow worse; his farm was ill worked or neglected, and by"
659,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"the fall, his horse and oxen had to go for necessary expenses. Ellen"
660,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"still kept her cows, but it was now very little help she received from"
661,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"her husband. He had been formerly one of the most temperate of men, but"
662,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,now he spent his days from home; and here lay Ellen's deepest sorrow. He
663,EDWARD AND ELLEN.,"was often at the village tavern, wasting in senseless riot the time,"

701,LILY FORD.,the village for the different families who depended upon her for their
702,LILY FORD.,supply of fresh butter and eggs. A year ago she had a neat little-wagon
703,LILY FORD.,"and a good horse to drive. There was something in the mind of Ellen,"

715,THE MARKET DAY.,"Mrs. Ford had three little children, Lily, Hetty, and a dear little"
716,THE MARKET DAY.,"babe. As she was now going to market, she told Lily, her oldest"
717,THE MARKET DAY.,"daughter, to take good care of the baby. Lily promised to do so. It was"
718,THE MARKET DAY.,a very cold day. For a time the children got along very well; but soon
719,THE MARKET DAY.,"the wood was all burned, not a stick or chip remained; as their father"
720,THE MARKET DAY.,"had gone away in the morning without splitting any, so they were obliged"
721,THE MARKET DAY.,"to do the best they could. The baby began to look as if it was cold, and"
722,THE MARKET DAY.,Lily said:
723,THE MARKET DAY.,
724,THE MARKET DAY.,"""Come, Hetty, we will go out and see if together we cannot roll in one"
725,THE MARKET DAY.,"of those great logs."""
726,THE MARKET DAY.,
727,THE MARKET DAY.,Hetty was eleven years old. Lily put the baby in the cradle and then
728,THE MARKET DAY.,"went out with Hetty to roll in the log. They rolled it up to the step,"
729,THE MARKET DAY.,"and got it part way into the door, but, alas! they could not get it"
730,THE MARKET DAY.,"further. There it stuck in the doorway, and the door was wide open; the"
731,THE MARKET DAY.,"wind and snow beat in from without, and the fire gradually settled away"
732,THE MARKET DAY.,in its embers.
733,THE MARKET DAY.,
734,THE MARKET DAY.,Something must now be done. Hetty put on her cloak and hood and set out
735,THE MARKET DAY.,for her mother; for she told them if anything happened to be sure and
736,THE MARKET DAY.,"come for her. Hetty soon found her mother at the village store, and"
737,THE MARKET DAY.,"without stopping to warm herself, she said:"
738,THE MARKET DAY.,
739,THE MARKET DAY.,"""O mother, come home, for little Eddy is sick, and Lily says it is the"
740,THE MARKET DAY.,"croup, and that he is dying. The fire is all out, and the room is full"
741,THE MARKET DAY.,"of snow, because the big log we tried to roll in stuck fast in the"
742,THE MARKET DAY.,"doorway."""
743,THE MARKET DAY.,
744,THE MARKET DAY.,Hetty and her mother hastened home: and as they were crossing the
745,THE MARKET DAY.,"street, there was her husband just entering the tavern. She told him"
746,THE MARKET DAY.,"about little Eddy, and he promised to go for a physician, and to come"
747,THE MARKET DAY.,"home immediately; and by the time they had gone half way home, Edward,"
748,THE MARKET DAY.,"her husband, joined them."
749,THE MARKET DAY.,
750,THE MARKET DAY.,"They hurried along, and as they came near the cottage there stood two of"
751,THE MARKET DAY.,"the cows, and under the shed was the third, the old ""spotted cow,"" which"
752,THE MARKET DAY.,Hetty thought was in the pond when she left home. To their surprise the
753,THE MARKET DAY.,"log was rolled away from the door, and as Mrs. Ford opened the door with"
754,THE MARKET DAY.,"a trembling hand, fearing her baby was dead, there was a young man"
755,THE MARKET DAY.,"sitting by a good fire, which he had made while Hetty was gone, with"
756,THE MARKET DAY.,little Eddy folded in his arms. The anxious mother bent over her baby as
757,THE MARKET DAY.,"he lay in the stranger's arms, and seeing his eyes closed, she"
758,THE MARKET DAY.,whispered:
759,THE MARKET DAY.,
760,THE MARKET DAY.,"""Is he dead?"""
761,THE MARKET DAY.,
762,THE MARKET DAY.,"""He is not, he only sleeps,"" replied the stranger."
763,THE MARKET DAY.,
764,THE MARKET DAY.,This young man came into the house in time to save the baby from the
765,THE MARKET DAY.,cold chills of death. He was ever after a friend to the family--a means
766,THE MARKET DAY.,"of Edward's reformation, so that with some assistance the mortgage on"
767,THE MARKET DAY.,"the farm was paid off, and the farm re-stocked. This stranger became the"

1072,BERTIE'S BOX.,"A very little boy by the name of ""Bertie,"" kept a box in which he"

1074,BERTIE'S BOX.,and opened it. It was full of all sorts of things. There were specimens
1075,BERTIE'S BOX.,"of stones, and shells, and moss, and grass, and dried flowers. There"
1076,BERTIE'S BOX.,"were, also, curious flies, found dead; but they were not destroyed by"
1077,BERTIE'S BOX.,"him, as he would never sacrifice a short sunny existence for self"
1078,BERTIE'S BOX.,gratification. There were a number of books and small ornamental toys
1079,BERTIE'S BOX.,"which had been given him--a drawing slate with pencils, colored chalks,"
1080,BERTIE'S BOX.,"a small box of colors, some little plates which he had colored in his"
1081,BERTIE'S BOX.,"own untaught style--a commenced copy of the hymn, ""I know that my"
1082,BERTIE'S BOX.,"Redeemer liveth""--an unfinished letter to his grandpapa, and some torn"
1083,BERTIE'S BOX.,leaves which he had found with passages of scripture upon them--a copy
1084,BERTIE'S BOX.,"of the ""lines on the death of an only son."" Also a number of sketches of"
1085,BERTIE'S BOX.,"missionary stations, chapels and schools, which he had cut out and"
1086,BERTIE'S BOX.,"colored. His mother once asked him why he cut them out, saying, that"
1087,BERTIE'S BOX.,"there might be some reading on the back of the pieces worth saving. ""Oh"
1088,BERTIE'S BOX.,"no, mamma,"" he replied, ""I looked carefully at the backs first."" In the"

1092,BERTIE'S BOX.,And as you will be pleased to know what was done with the box of

1094,BERTIE'S BOX.,"""that after he was gone, I should not know what to do with Bertie's Box"
1095,BERTIE'S BOX.,"of treasures; I therefore asked him what I should do with them."" He"
1096,BERTIE'S BOX.,"replied, ""Oh, give half to God and half to the children, and be sure to"
1097,BERTIE'S BOX.,"divide them fairly."" The money in the box was devoted to the purchase of"
1098,BERTIE'S BOX.,"the Bible--and a collecting box made in the form of a Bible; for, said"
1099,BERTIE'S BOX.,"he, ""when my friends come and give money to the children, then hold"
1100,BERTIE'S BOX.,"Bertie's box for Bertie's share."" This is a good example for all"

1145,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,Anne was the daughter of a wealthy farmer. She had a good New England
1146,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"school education, and was well bred and well taught at home in the"
1147,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,virtues and manners that constitute domestic social life. Her father
1148,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,died a year before her marriage. He left a will dividing his property
1149,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"equally between his son and daughter, giving to the son the homestead"
1150,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"with all its accumulated riches, and to the daughter the largest share"
1151,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"of the personal property, amounting to 6 or 7000 dollars. This little"
1152,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,fortune became at Anne's marriage the property of her husband. It would
1153,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,seem that the property of a woman received from her father should be
1154,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,her's. But the laws of a barbarous age fix it otherwise.
1155,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,
1156,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"Anne married John Warren, who was the youngest child, daintily bred by"
1157,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,his parents. He opened a dry goods store in a small town in the vicinity
1158,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"of B----, where he invested Anne's property. He was a farmer, and did"
1159,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,not think of the qualifications necessary to a successful merchant. For
1160,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"five or six years he went on tolerably, living _genteelly_ and"
1161,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"_recklessly_, expecting that every year's gain would make up the excess"
1162,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"of the past. When sixteen years of their married life had passed, they"
1163,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,were living in a single room in the crowded street of R----. Every penny
1164,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,of the inheritance was gone--three children had died--three survived; a
1165,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"girl of fifteen years, whom the mother was educating to be a"
1166,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"teacher--boy of twelve who was living at home, and Jessy, a pale,"
1167,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"delicate, little struggler for life, three years old."
1168,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,
1169,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,Mrs. W---- was much changed in these sixteen years. Her round blooming
1170,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"cheek was pale and sunken, her dark chestnut hair had become thin and"
1171,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"gray, her bright eyes, over-tasked by use and watching, were faded, and"
1172,ANNE CLEAVELAND.,"her whole person shrunken. Yet she had gained a great victory. Yes, it"

1443,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"a man like father, she was all that is lovable in the character of"
1444,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),woman.
1445,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),
1446,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"But the dear old home, where I grew from infancy to boyhood, and from"
1447,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"boyhood to youth, I shall never forget. It was a large house on the"
1448,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"slope of a hill, just high enough to overlook several miles of our level"
1449,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"country, and smooth enough with its soft grassy carpet for us to roll"
1450,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),down from the summit to the foot of the hill. At the back of the house
1451,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"was another hill, where we used to roll under the shade of the old elm,"
1452,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"and where Miles and I would sit whole afternoons and fly the kite, each"
1453,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"taking turns in holding the string. This was a happy place for us, and"
1454,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"especially in the spring time, when the happy looking cows grazed along"
1455,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),the pathway which winds around the elm to the stream where Kate and I
1456,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),used to sail my little boat. All summer long this place was vocal with
1457,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"the songs of birds, which built their nests in safety among the tall"
1458,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),trees of the grove in the rear of the farm. We had also the music of the
1459,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"running brook, and the pleasant hum of my father's cotton mill, which"
1460,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),brought us in our daily bread. Haying time was always a happy season for
1461,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"us boys. Father's two horses, ""_Dick_"" and ""_Bony_"" would take off the"
1462,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),farm as large a load of hay as any in the village.
1463,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),
1464,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"Years past on, and we were a happy band of brothers and sisters. After"
1465,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"Kate, came the twins, Margaret and Herbert, and last of all came the"
1466,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"youngest darling, blue eyed Dora. We had a happy childhood. Our station"
1467,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),in the world was high enough to enable us to have all the harmless
1468,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),pleasures and studies that were useful and actually necessary to boys
1469,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),and girls of our station. Father always thought that it was better in
1470,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"early youth not to force the boys to too hard study, and mother loved"
1471,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"best to see Kate and Margaret using the fingers in fabricating garments,"
1472,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"than in playing the harp. We were free, happy, roving children on"
1473,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"father's farm, unchained by the forms of fashionable life. We had no"
1474,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"costly dresses to spoil, and were permitted to play in the green fields"
1475,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"without a servant's eye, and to bathe in the clear shallow stream"
1476,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"without fear of drowning. As I have said before, these were happy days;"
1477,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),"and when I think of them gone, I often express my regret that we did not"
1478,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),improve them more for the cultivation of the mind and the affections. In
1479,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),the next story you will see that there were some passing clouds in our
1480,(SEE FRONTISPIECE.),early summer days.

1488,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,In a large family there are often diversity of character and varieties
1489,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"of mood and temper, which bring some clouds of sorrow. In our little"
1490,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,Eden of innocence there were storms now and then. Miles was a little
1491,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"wild and headstrong from his babyhood, and Margaret, though very"
1492,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"beautiful, was often wilful and vain. For five years the twins had grown"
1493,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,up together the same in beauty and health. One day an accident befell
1494,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"Herbert, and the dear child rose from his bed of sickness a pale and"
1495,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,crippled boy. His twin sister grew up tall and blooming. The twins loved
1496,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"each other very much, and it was a pleasant sight to see how the"
1497,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,deformed boy was cherished and protected by his sister Margaret. She
1498,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,would often leave us in the midst of our plays to go and sit by
1499,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"Herbert, who could not share with us in them."
1500,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1501,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"We had our yearly festivals, our cowslip gatherings, our blackberry"

1505,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"Herbert and Margaret's birthdays came in the sunny time of May, when"
1506,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,there were double rejoicings to be made. They were always set up in
1507,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"their chairs in the bower, decorated with flowers and crowned with"
1508,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"wreaths. I now think of Margaret smiling under her brilliant garland,"
1509,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,while poor Herbert looked up to her with his pale sweet face. I heard
1510,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,him once say to her when we had all gone away to pluck flowers:
1511,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1512,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"""How beautiful you are to-day, Margaret, with your rosy cheeks and"
1513,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"brown hair."""
1514,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1515,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"""But that does not make me any better or prettier than you, because I am"
1516,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"strong and you are not, or that my cheeks are red and yours are pale."""
1517,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1518,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,Miles was just carrying little Dora over the steeping stones at the
1519,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"brook, when Herbert cried:"
1520,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1521,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"""O, if I could only run and leap like Miles; but I am very helpless."""
1522,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,
1523,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"To which Margaret replied: ""Never mind, brother; I will love you and"
1524,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"take care of you all your life,"" and she said these words with a"
1525,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"sister's love, as she put her arms around the neck of her helpless"
1526,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"brother. She loved him the more, and aimed to please him by reading"
1527,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,"books to him which were his delight. This was a pleasant sight, and the"
1528,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,brothers always admired Margaret for her attention to their helpless
1529,MARGARET AND HERBERT.,brother.

1597,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"One of his sisters, who had been married some time, came with her babe"

1600,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,and told Benjamin to take care of the little child while they were gone;
1601,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,and gave him a fan to flap away the flies from his little charge. After
1602,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"some time the child appeared to smile in its sleep, and it attracted"
1603,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"young Benny's attention. He was so pleased with the smiling, sleeping,"
1604,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,babe that he thought he would see what he could do at drawing a portrait
1605,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"of it. He was only in his seventh year; he got some paper, pens, and"
1606,BENNY'S FIRST DRAWING.,"some red and black ink, and commenced his work, and soon drew the"

1645,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,Prestons in Westmoreland. For two hundred years this land had been
1646,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,theirs. Mr. Preston and his wife were industrious and respectable
1647,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"people. They had two children, Martha and John. The sister was eight"
1648,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,years older than her brother and acted a motherly part towards him. As
1649,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"her mother had to go to market, to see to the cows and dairy, and to"

1653,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,It is said that a very active mother does not _always_ make a very

1656,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,Preston said that Martha was too long in going to market with the
1657,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"butter, and she made the bread too thick, and did not press all the"
1658,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"water out of the butter, and she folded up the fleeces the wrong way,"
1659,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,and therefore she did all herself. Hence Martha was left to take the
1660,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"whole care of Johnny, and to roam about in the woods. When she was"
1661,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"about fifteen her mother died, so that Martha was left her mother's"
1662,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"place in the house, which she filled beyond the expectation of all the"
1663,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"neighbors. Her father died when Johnny was sixteen, and his last advice"
1664,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"to his daughter was, to take care of her brother, to look after his"
1665,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"worldly affairs, and above all to bear his soul in prayer to heaven,"
1666,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,where he hoped to meet the household once more. The share of her
1667,THE GREY OLD COTTAGE.,"father's property when he died, was eighty pounds. Here Martha spent her"

1687,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,
1688,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"""Lie down, Fly,--good dog--lie down,"" she said; but Fly would not mind"

1690,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"matter, and she felt she must go up to the fell; and with the foresight"
1691,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"common to the Dale's people, who knew what mountain storms are, she took"
1692,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"under her cloak a small vial of gin, which was kept in case of any"
1693,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"accident, and set out with the dog Fly. The snow fell fast, the wind"
1694,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"blew, and the drifts lay thick. She had great confidence in Fly, that if"
1695,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,any thing was the matter he would find it out. He ran straight up the
1696,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"little steep path which led through the woods. On she followed, her"
1697,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"cloak white with snow, until she came into the more open ground, where"
1698,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"she lost sight of Fly, and for a time stood bewildered, until he should"
1699,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"return and guide her. The birds and beasts had gone to rest, and the"
1700,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"stillness of the moors was awful. It was night, and dark. Suddenly she"
1701,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"heard a child's feeble voice, and in an instant she pressed on towards"
1702,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,the spot from which the sound came; soon she heard Fly's loud howl for
1703,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"aid. At last she reached the spot, and found a little boy half asleep, a"
1704,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,kind of drowsiness which precedes death. He could not speak; he could
1705,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"only moan. She moistened his lips with the gin, and poured a little down"
1706,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,his throat. She then raised him up and carried him a short distance down
1707,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,the hill; then she stopped to rest awhile; and then she got as far as
1708,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"the woods, where the winds were not so cold. Again she gave him a few"
1709,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"drops from her vial, and now he was able to walk a few steps; then"
1710,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"Martha put up a fervent prayer to God for assistance, as she dragged the"
1711,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"lost boy to her cottage. She now laid him down to the warm fire, while"
1712,THE BOY FOUND IN THE SNOW.,"Fly snuffed around him in great joy. She took off his wet clothes, and"

1884,THE GLOW WORM.,
1885,THE GLOW WORM.,"""What is it,"" cried little Frank, jumping out of bed and running to"

1893,THE GLOW WORM.,"""Take care,"" said Frank, ""that it does not burn the counterpane."" The"

1896,THE GLOW WORM.,"that the glow worm's light, though it shines so brightly, does not burn."
1897,THE GLOW WORM.,To convince Frank she told him to hold out his hand. The little boy felt
1898,THE GLOW WORM.,"afraid, but as he knew that Lucy never deceived him, he put out his"
1899,THE GLOW WORM.,"hand, and soon, to his great delight, the harmless glow worm lay in his"
1900,THE GLOW WORM.,hand. Lucy promised to tell him something about the glow worm another
1901,THE GLOW WORM.,"time. Frank went back to his bed, and Lucy bid her brothers good night,"

1904,THE GLOW WORM.,"So night after night, for weeks, the three boys saw the twinkling light"

1907,THE GLOW WORM.,it. It grieved him to hear his brothers quarrelling and saying unkind
1908,THE GLOW WORM.,words to each other; and he also thought that the poor glow worm ought
1909,THE GLOW WORM.,"not to be kept a prisoner under the glass, instead of flying over the"
1910,THE GLOW WORM.,green turf or the mossy bank. But when he tried to bring John and Robert
1911,THE GLOW WORM.,"to the same opinion, they would not hear to him. So Lucy, who was a kind"
1912,THE GLOW WORM.,"sister, when she found that the pleasure she had procured for them was"
1913,THE GLOW WORM.,"the occasion of their naughty conduct, sat down by the window and told"
1914,THE GLOW WORM.,"them to remember that God, who made the glow worm and caused its light"

1927,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"James. It was a rural spot, as it was surrounded with all the beauties"
1928,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"of nature. There were rippling streams, and winding paths through the"
1929,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"green fields and woods, sunny hills and mossy rocks. Emily, the only"
1930,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"daughter of Mr. J., had all these pleasant scenes to enjoy, and every"
1931,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,thing to make her home happy. Her father owned a noble pair of grays and
1932,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"a very fine carriage, and she had the pleasure of riding with her father"
1933,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,whenever she chose. But Emily did not live altogether for her own
1934,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,happiness; she was accustomed to go and see the people in the
1935,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"neighborhood of her home, and if any were poor or sick she would always"
1936,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,try to benefit them.
1937,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1938,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,Her mother had to put up many a bundle of nice things for her to take to
1939,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"some poor family in need. She was also fond of the works of nature, and"
1940,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,would frequently spend an hour in walking alone in the shady and rural
1941,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"places in her town. One day, as the beautiful spring had just unfolded"
1942,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"its loveliness, Emily thought she would walk out and breathe the"
1943,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,delicious air. With a heart laden with good thoughts and with a quick
1944,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,step she passed along the gravelled street and by the cultivated grounds
1945,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"and fine houses, until she reached the green turf and wooded slopes, and"
1946,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"here paused awhile under the large old trees, and thought of the"

1949,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"On her route, where the river curved around the foot of a gentle sloping"
1950,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"hill in the shadows of old forest trees, was made a rural cemetery; so"
1951,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"pleasant were its quiet paths and its cool shades in summer, that the"
1952,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,living loved to wander there. Friends came there to plant flowers upon
1953,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,the graves of dear ones they had lost.
1954,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1955,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"Through a low ivy covered gateway of stone, Emily entered the quiet"
1956,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"place. There were no massive railings, and lofty monuments, and no"
1957,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"costly devices, but God had made this place very beautiful--flowers were"
1958,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"blooming along the well trodden paths, and around the last resting"
1959,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,places of the dead. Here and there arose a simple shaft or a light
1960,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"column, and the graves of the household were bordered by a green hedge"
1961,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,or surrounded by shadowing trees.
1962,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1963,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"As Emily passed through the familiar walks, she came suddenly to a"
1964,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"grave in the remote corner of the cemetery, beside which sat a solitary"
1965,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,mourner. A small white slab lay upon the centre of the green mound and
1966,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"at its head grew a rose bush in bloom, bending, till its weight of white"
1967,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,buds and blossoms touched the long bright grass upon the grave. Emily
1968,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"was attracted by its simple beauty, and drawing near, she stooped down"
1969,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"and read upon the marble slab, ""Dear Mina."" Her young eyes filled"
1970,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"instantly with tears, for she knew that it was the darling child of a"
1971,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,lady who to her was a stranger. As she turned away from the spot she met
1972,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"a lady approaching, who passed her and kneeled down beside the grave."
1973,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"She thought she would speak to the lady, and with tender sympathy she"
1974,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"asked, ""Was it your child?"""
1975,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,
1976,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"The lady, who was deep in thought, looked up at the sound of Emily's"
1977,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"earnest voice, and answered, softly, ""Yes; 'Dear Mina' was my only"
1978,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"child."" This interview led Emily to an acquaintance with the sorrowing"
1979,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"mother, which caused her never to forget her morning ramble. She was a"
1980,EMILY'S MORNING RAMBLE.,"good woman, and at the decease of Emily's mother became her Christian"

2110,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"Two little girls went into the fields to gather flowers. Buttercups,"
2111,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"violets, and many other blossoms were in abundance. One of the girls was"
2112,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"pleased with every thing, and began to pick such flowers as came in her"
2113,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"way. In a short time she collected a great quantity of flowers, and"
2114,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"though some of them were not very handsome, yet they made a very"
2115,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,beautiful bunch. The other child was more dainty and determined to get
2116,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,her none but those which were very beautiful. The buttercups were all of
2117,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,one color and did not strike her fancy--the blue violets were too
2118,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"common, and so the little pair wandered on through the fields till they"
2119,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"were about to return home. By this time the dainty child, seeing that"
2120,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"her sister had a fine collection of flowers while she had none, began"
2121,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,to think it best to pick such as she could get. But now the flowers were
2122,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,scarce; not even a dandelion nor a flower was to be found. The little
2123,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"girl at length begged of her sister a single dandelion, and thus they"
2124,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"returned home. The children told their story, and their mother addressed"
2125,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"them thus--""My dear children, let this event teach you a lesson. Jane"
2126,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"has acted the wisest part. Content with such flowers as came in her way,"
2127,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"and not aiming at what was beyond her reach, she has been successful in"

2129,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"found, collected nothing from the field, and was finally obliged to beg"
2130,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"a simple flower from her sister. So it is, children, in passing through"
2131,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"life--gather what is good and pleasant along your path, and you will,"
2132,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"day by day, collect enough to make you contented and happy. But if you"

2134,GATHER THE FLOWERS.,"more rare and difficult to be obtained, you will meet with frequent"

2160,JANE AND HER LESSONS.,"from her first being able to read, she was very fond of reading; and at"

2167,JANE AND HER LESSONS.,"There was a very fine garden attached to Mrs. Sumner's residence, where"

2170,JANE AND HER LESSONS.,"broad leaves of the vine made a refreshing shade to it, and thereby"
2171,JANE AND HER LESSONS.,shielded the warm sun from persons under it. This little summer house
2172,JANE AND HER LESSONS.,Jane frequently occupied for her study. In the picture you see her with

2291,THE TWO ROBINS.,"of the lower branches within my reach, and very soon I discovered two"
2292,THE TWO ROBINS.,birds engaged in fighting; and they seemed to gradually descend towards
2293,THE TWO ROBINS.,"the ground. They came down lower and lower, tumbling over one another,"
2294,THE TWO ROBINS.,"and fighting with each other. They soon reached the lowest branch, and"
2295,THE TWO ROBINS.,at last came to the ground very near me. It was with some difficulty
2296,THE TWO ROBINS.,"that I parted them; and when I held one of them in each of my hands,"
2297,THE TWO ROBINS.,"they tried to get away, not because they were afraid of me but because"
2298,THE TWO ROBINS.,"they would resume the conflict. They were two young robins, and I never"
2299,THE TWO ROBINS.,before thought that the robin had such a bad spirit in its breast. Lest

2556,YOUNG USHER.,"You gave read of that remarkable man, Mr. Usher, who was Archbishop of"
2557,YOUNG USHER.,Armagh. I will tell you something about his early childhood. He was born
2558,YOUNG USHER.,"in Dublin, in the year 1580, and when a little boy he was fond of"
2559,YOUNG USHER.,"reading. He lived with his two aunts who were born blind, and who"
2560,YOUNG USHER.,acquired much knowledge of the Scriptures by hearing others read the
2561,YOUNG USHER.,Scriptures and other good books. At seven years of age he was sent to
2562,YOUNG USHER.,school in Dublin; at the end of five years he was superior in study to
2563,YOUNG USHER.,"any of his school fellows, and was thought fully qualified to enter the"
2564,YOUNG USHER.,college at Dublin.
2565,YOUNG USHER.,
2566,YOUNG USHER.,"While he was at college he learned to play at cards, and he was so much"
2567,YOUNG USHER.,taken up with this amusement that both his learning and piety were much
2568,YOUNG USHER.,"endangered. He saw the evil tendency of playing at cards, and at once"
2569,YOUNG USHER.,"relinquished the practice entirely. When he was nine years old, he heard"
2570,YOUNG USHER.,a sermon preached which made a deep impression on his mind. From that
2571,YOUNG USHER.,"time he was accustomed to habits of devotion. He loved to pray, and he"
2572,YOUNG USHER.,felt that he could not sleep quietly without first commending himself to
2573,YOUNG USHER.,the care of his Heavenly Father for protection. You see him in the
2574,YOUNG USHER.,"picture kneeling by his bed side, alone with God. When he was fourteen"
2575,YOUNG USHER.,"years old, he began to think about partaking of the Lord's supper. He"
2576,YOUNG USHER.,"thought this act to be a very solemn and important one, and required a"
2577,YOUNG USHER.,"thorough preparation. On the afternoon previous to the communion, he"
2578,YOUNG USHER.,would retire to some private place for self examination and prayer. When
2579,YOUNG USHER.,"he was but sixteen years of age, he obtained such a knowledge of"
2580,YOUNG USHER.,chronology as to have commenced the annals of the Old and New
2581,YOUNG USHER.,"Testaments, which were published many years after, and are now a general"
2582,YOUNG USHER.,standard of reference.
2583,YOUNG USHER.,
2584,YOUNG USHER.,"When his father died, he being the eldest son, the paternal estate was"
2585,YOUNG USHER.,left to him to manage. But as he feared that it would occupy too much of
2586,YOUNG USHER.,"his time and attention, he gave it entirely to his brother and sisters,"
2587,YOUNG USHER.,reserving only enough for his books and college expenses. At the age of
2588,YOUNG USHER.,"twenty he entered the ministry, and seven years after was chosen a"
2589,YOUNG USHER.,"professor in the University of Dublin. In 1640, he visited England at"
2590,YOUNG USHER.,the time of the commencement of the rebellion; all his goods were seized
2591,YOUNG USHER.,"by the popish party, except some furniture in his house, and his library"
2592,YOUNG USHER.,"at Drogheda, which was afterwards sent to London. He bore his loss with"
2593,YOUNG USHER.,"submission, but he never returned to Ireland. He had many trials to"
2594,YOUNG USHER.,"endure on account of the troublous times in England, (it being the time"
2595,YOUNG USHER.,of the civil wars.) In 1646 he received a kind invitation from the
2596,YOUNG USHER.,"Countess of Peterborough to reside in one of her houses, which proposal"
2597,YOUNG USHER.,"he accepted and lived in one of them till his death, in 1665. By the"

2693,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,she died she appeared to all who knew her to be prepared for heaven.
2694,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"While she was sick, her parents did every thing to make her comfortable"

2697,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"that she could not play with him, he would come and lay himself down at"

2700,LIZZY AND HER DOG.,"grave yard where Lizzy was laid away. One day, about five months"

3059,THE PLUM BOYS.,"a cornfield, in which there were some plum trees, full of nice ripe"

3066,THE PLUM BOYS.,
3067,THE PLUM BOYS.,"""You are a coward,"" said Henry, ""I always knew you were a coward, and if"

3070,THE PLUM BOYS.,
3071,THE PLUM BOYS.,"Just as Henry was climbing the fence, the owner of the field rose up"
3072,THE PLUM BOYS.,"from the other side of the wall, and Henry jumped back, and ran away."
3073,THE PLUM BOYS.,"Thomas had no reason to be afraid, so he stood still, and the owner of"
3074,THE PLUM BOYS.,"the field, who had heard the conversation between the boys, told him"
3075,THE PLUM BOYS.,that he was very glad to see that he was not willing to be a thief. He
3076,THE PLUM BOYS.,then told Thomas that he might step over the fence and help himself to
3077,THE PLUM BOYS.,"as many plums as he wished. The boy was pleased with the invitation, and"
3078,THE PLUM BOYS.,soon filled his pockets with plums which he could call his own. Honesty
3079,THE PLUM BOYS.,will always get its reward.

3142,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,and could never see the suffering of his fellow beings without making an
3143,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,effort for their relief. Here is one instance of his kindness and
3144,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,liberality.
3145,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,
3146,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"While he resided in Bristol, his father, Dr. Terry, took little Emerson"
3147,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,with him to ride into Hartford that he might see the city. Emerson had
3148,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"one dollar, and it was the first dollar he ever earned. He took the"
3149,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"dollar with him, thinking to buy something with it in the city. While"
3150,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"they were riding along on the way, they overtook a poor fugitive slave"
3151,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,seeking his freedom in the North. Mr. Terry kindly took the wayfaring
3152,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,man into his carriage when the poor man related to him his sufferings
3153,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"and poverty, and also his trust in God. Young Emerson's heart was"
3154,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"touched, when, of his own accord, he drew out his _first_ and _only_"
3155,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,dollar and gave it to the poor fugitive. When he returned home he told
3156,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"his mother what he had done, with a satisfaction that indicated his"
3157,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,pleasure in being able to relieve a suffering stranger. How noble was
3158,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,this act. He felt willing to forego the pleasure of spending his dollar
3159,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"for himself, for any pleasing toys, that he might help a poor wanderer"
3160,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"on the earth. When he was fifteen years of age, he was drowned in the"
3161,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,Connecticut River. He was beloved and respected by a large circle of
3162,THE FIRST DOLLAR.,"acquaintance. He was noted for his kind disposition, tender feelings,"

3217,PLEASANT PLAY.,There are many plays in which children may amuse themselves so as to

3219,PLEASANT PLAY.,"health, and all children should accustom themselves to such exercise as"
3220,PLEASANT PLAY.,will give elasticity to all the muscles of the body. Some children often
3221,PLEASANT PLAY.,"play too hard, and others, before they get through playing, get to"
3222,PLEASANT PLAY.,quarrelling. Children never appear so badly as when they quarrel with
3223,PLEASANT PLAY.,"each other. Joseph and William, Jane and little Susan, are out in the"
3224,PLEASANT PLAY.,"garden playing ""hide and seek,"" around the summer house, as you see in"

3226,PLEASANT PLAY.,"the play did not suit him, and declared he would run away. And you see"
3227,PLEASANT PLAY.,"how cross he looks at Jane, as he turns round to run away. Children"
3228,PLEASANT PLAY.,should never let anger rise in their bosoms because of some small
3229,PLEASANT PLAY.,"mistake on the part of others. They should always overlook all mistakes,"
3230,PLEASANT PLAY.,"forgive all injuries, and learn to love each other when at play, as well"

3256,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,wanted of his guinea; he told her he wished to put it in the box when it
3257,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"came round, to assist in sending the gospel to the heathen children. She"
3258,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"replied, ""a guinea is a great deal of money, George; you had better ask"
3259,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"your mother, first."" As George's mother lived very near the church, he"
3260,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"went home immediately, and said, ""Mother, will you let me have my guinea"
3261,GEORGE AND HIS GUINEA.,"to give to the mission."" George's mother saw that he was very much"
