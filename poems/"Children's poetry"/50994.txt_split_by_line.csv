81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,
83,PREFACE,"In compiling a selection of Poetry for Children, a conscientious Editor"
84,PREFACE,is bound to find himself confronted with limitations so numerous as
85,PREFACE,"to be almost disheartening. For he has to remember that his task is,"
86,PREFACE,"not to provide simple examples of the whole range of English poetry,"
87,PREFACE,but to set up a wicket-gate giving attractive admission to that wide
88,PREFACE,"domain, with its woodland glades, its pasture and arable, its walled"
89,PREFACE,"and scented gardens here and there, and so to its sunlit, and sometimes"
90,PREFACE,"misty, mountain-tops--all to be more fully explored later by those who"
91,PREFACE,are tempted on by the first glimpse. And always he must be proclaiming
92,PREFACE,"to the small tourists that there is joy, light and fresh air in that"
93,PREFACE,delectable country.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,"Briefly, I think that blank verse generally, and the drama as a"
96,PREFACE,"whole, may very well be left for readers of a riper age. Indeed, I"
97,PREFACE,believe that those who can ignore the plays of Shakespeare and his
98,PREFACE,fellow-Elizabethans till they are sixteen will be no losers in the
99,PREFACE,"long run. The bulk, too, of seventeenth and eighteenth century poetry,"
100,PREFACE,bending under its burden of classical form and crowded classical
101,PREFACE,"allusion, requires a completed education and a wide range of reading"
102,PREFACE,for its proper appreciation.
103,PREFACE,
104,PREFACE,"Much else also is barred. There are the questions of subject, of"
105,PREFACE,"archaic language and thought, and of occasional expression, which will"
106,PREFACE,"occur to everyone. Then there is dialect, and here one has to remember"
107,PREFACE,that these poems are intended for use at the very time that a child
108,PREFACE,is painfully acquiring a normal--often quite arbitrary--orthography.
109,PREFACE,Is it fair to that child to hammer into him--perhaps literally--that
110,PREFACE,"porridge is spelt porridge, and next minute to present it to him, in an"
111,PREFACE,"official ‘Reader,’ under the guise of parritch? I think not; and I have"
112,PREFACE,"accordingly kept as far as possible to the normal, though at some loss"
113,PREFACE,of material.
114,PREFACE,
115,PREFACE,In the output of those writers who have deliberately written for
116,PREFACE,"children, it is surprising how largely the subject of _death_ is found"
117,PREFACE,"to bulk. Dead fathers and mothers, dead brothers and sisters, dead"
118,PREFACE,"uncles and aunts, dead puppies and kittens, dead birds, dead flowers,"
119,PREFACE,dead dolls--a compiler of Obituary Verse for the delight of children
120,PREFACE,could make a fine fat volume with little difficulty. I have turned off
121,PREFACE,"this mournful tap of tears as far as possible, preferring that children"
122,PREFACE,"should read of the joy of life, rather than revel in sentimental"
123,PREFACE,thrills of imagined bereavement.
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,"There exists, moreover, any quantity of verse for children, which is"
126,PREFACE,merely verse and nothing more. It lacks the vital spark of heavenly
127,PREFACE,"flame, and is useless to a selector of Poetry. And then there is the"
128,PREFACE,whole corpus of verse--most of it of the present day--which is written
129,PREFACE,"_about_ children, and this has even more carefully to be avoided. When"
130,PREFACE,"the time comes that we send our parents to school, it will prove very"
131,PREFACE,useful to the compilers of their primers.
132,PREFACE,
133,PREFACE,"All these restrictions have necessarily led to two results. First,"
134,PREFACE,"that this collection is chiefly lyrical--and that, after all, is no"
135,PREFACE,bad thing. Lyric verse may not be representative of the whole range of
136,PREFACE,"English poetry, but as an introduction to it, as a Wicket-gate, there"
137,PREFACE,"is no better portal. The second result is, that it is but a small sheaf"
138,PREFACE,that these gleanings amount to; but for those children who frankly do
139,PREFACE,not care for poetry it will be more than enough; and for those who
140,PREFACE,"love it and delight in it, no ‘selection’ could ever be sufficiently"
141,PREFACE,satisfying.

933,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,I’ll make a commotion in every place!”

935,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,Creaking the signs and scattering down
936,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"Shutters; and whisking, with merciless squalls,"
937,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,Old women’s bonnets and gingerbread stalls.
938,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"There never was heard a much lustier shout,"

940,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"And the urchins, that stand with their thievish eyes"
941,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"For ever on watch, ran off each with a prize."
942,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,

944,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.

946,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"And tossed the colts’ manes all about their brows,"
947,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"Till, offended at such a familiar salute,"
948,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"They all turned their backs, and stood sullenly mute."
949,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"So on it went, capering and playing its pranks;"

969,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"There was rearing of ladders, and logs laying on"
970,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.
971,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane"
972,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"With a schoolboy, who panted and struggled in vain;"
973,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"For it tossed him and twirled him, then passed, and he stood"
974,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,With his hat in a pool and his shoe in the mud.
975,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,
976,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"But away went the wind in its holiday glee,"
977,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"And now it was far on the billowy sea,"

979,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,And the little boats darted to and fro.
980,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"But lo! it was night, and it sank to rest,"
981,THE WIND IN A FROLIC,"On the sea-bird’s rock in the gleaming West,"

1258,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"So said little Robert, and pacing along,"
1259,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"His merry Companions came forth in a throng,"
1260,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And on the smooth Grass by the side of a Wood,"
1261,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"Beneath a broad oak that for ages had stood,"
1262,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,Saw the Children of Earth and the Tenants of Air
1263,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,For an Evening’s Amusement together repair.
1264,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,
1265,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And there came the Beetle, so blind and so black,"

1269,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And there came the Moth, with his plumage of down,"
1270,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,And the Hornet in jacket of yellow and brown;
1271,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"Who with him the Wasp, his companion, did bring,"
1272,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,But they promised that evening to lay by their sting.
1273,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And the sly little Dormouse crept out of his hole,"
1274,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And brought to the feast his blind Brother, the Mole,"
1275,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"And the Snail, with his horns peeping out of his shell,"
1276,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"Came from a great distance, the length of an ell."

1280,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"The Viands were various, to each of their taste,"
1281,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,And the Bee brought her honey to crown the Repast.
1282,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,"Then close on his haunches, so solemn and wise,"
1283,THE BUTTERFLY’S BALL,The Frog from a corner look’d up to the skies;

1414,CONTENTMENT,"Went strutting round with pompous clucks,"

1421,CONTENTMENT,
1422,CONTENTMENT,"A season later, this old hen"
1423,CONTENTMENT,"Appeared, still cackling of her luck,"

1433,CONTENTMENT,"But lo! her babes were ducklings ten,"
1434,CONTENTMENT,Instead of chickens as before!
1435,CONTENTMENT,"“’Tis better,” said the old red hen,"

1446,CONTENTMENT,"And said: “’Tis best these things are so,"

1448,CONTENTMENT,
1449,CONTENTMENT,"I half suspect that many men,"

2065,KILMENY,(_A Story about one who went there_)
2066,KILMENY,
2067,KILMENY,
2068,KILMENY,Bonny Kilmeny gaed[6] up the glen;
2069,KILMENY,"But it wasna to meet Duneira’s men,"
2070,KILMENY,"Nor the rosy monk of the isle to see,"
2071,KILMENY,For Kilmeny was pure as pure could be.
2072,KILMENY,"It was only to hear the yorlin[7] sing,"
2073,KILMENY,And pull the blue cress-flower round the spring;
2074,KILMENY,"To pull the hip and the hindberrye[8],"
2075,KILMENY,And the nut that hung frae the hazel-tree;
2076,KILMENY,For Kilmeny was pure as pure could be.
2077,KILMENY,"But lang may her minnie[9] look o’er the wa’,"
2078,KILMENY,And lang may she seek in the greenwood shaw;
2079,KILMENY,"Lang the Laird o’ Duneira blame,"
2080,KILMENY,"And lang, lang greet[10] e’er Kilmeny come hame!"
2081,KILMENY,
2082,KILMENY,"When many a day had come and fled,"
2083,KILMENY,"When grief grew calm, and hope was dead,"
2084,KILMENY,"When mass for Kilmeny’s soul had been sung,"
2085,KILMENY,When the bedesman had prayed and the dead-bell rung;
2086,KILMENY,"Late, late in a gloaming, when all was still,"
2087,KILMENY,"When the fringe was red on the westlin[11] hill,"
2088,KILMENY,"The wood was sere, the moon i’ the wane,"
2089,KILMENY,"The reek[12] of the cot hung o’er the plain,"
2090,KILMENY,Like a little wee cloud in the world its lane[13];
2091,KILMENY,"When the ingle[14] lowed[15] with an eery gleam,"
2092,KILMENY,"Late, late in the gloamin’, Kilmeny came hame!"
2093,KILMENY,
2094,KILMENY,"“Kilmeny, Kilmeny, where have you been?"
2095,KILMENY,Lang hae we sought baith holt and dene;
2096,KILMENY,"By linn[16], by ford, and green-wood tree,"
2097,KILMENY,Yet you are halesome and fair to see.
2098,KILMENY,Where gat you that joup[17] of the lily sheen?
2099,KILMENY,That bonny snood[18] of the birk[19] sae green?
2100,KILMENY,"And these roses, the fairest that ever were seen?"
2101,KILMENY,"Kilmeny, Kilmeny, where have you been?”"
2102,KILMENY,
2103,KILMENY,"Kilmeny look’d up with a lovely grace,"
2104,KILMENY,But nae smile was seen on Kilmeny’s face;
2105,KILMENY,"As still was her look, and as still was her ee,"
2106,KILMENY,"As the stillness that lay on the emerald lea,"
2107,KILMENY,Or the mist that sleeps on a waveless sea.
2108,KILMENY,"For Kilmeny had been she knew not where,"
2109,KILMENY,And Kilmeny had seen what she could not declare.
2110,KILMENY,"Kilmeny had been where the cock never crew,"
2111,KILMENY,"Where the rain never fell, and the wind never blew."
2112,KILMENY,"But it seem’d as the harp of the sky had rung,"
2113,KILMENY,"And the airs of heaven play’d round her tongue,"
2114,KILMENY,"When she spake of the lovely forms she had seen,"
2115,KILMENY,And a land where sin had never been;
2116,KILMENY,"A land of love and a land of light,"
2117,KILMENY,"Withouten sun, or moon, or night;"
2118,KILMENY,"The land of vision it would seem,"
2119,KILMENY,And still an everlasting dream.

2121,KILMENY,*       *       *       *       *
2122,KILMENY,
2123,KILMENY,"They lifted Kilmeny, they led her away,"
2124,KILMENY,And she walk’d in the light of a sunless day;
2125,KILMENY,"The sky was a dome of crystal bright,"
2126,KILMENY,"The fountain of vision, and fountain of light:"
2127,KILMENY,"The emerald fields were of dazzling glow,"
2128,KILMENY,And the flowers of everlasting blow.
2129,KILMENY,"Then deep in the stream her body they laid,"
2130,KILMENY,That her youth and beauty might never fade;
2131,KILMENY,"And they smiled on heaven, when they saw her lie"
2132,KILMENY,In the stream of life that wander’d by.
2133,KILMENY,"And she heard a song, she heard it sung,"
2134,KILMENY,"She kenn’d not where; but so sweetly it rung,"
2135,KILMENY,It fell on the ear like a dream of the morn:
2136,KILMENY,“O blest be the day Kilmeny was born!”
2137,KILMENY,
2138,KILMENY,*       *       *       *       *
2139,KILMENY,
2140,KILMENY,"To sing of the sights Kilmeny saw,"
2141,KILMENY,"So far surpassing nature’s law,"
2142,KILMENY,"The singer’s voice would sink away,"
2143,KILMENY,And the string of his harp would cease to play.
2144,KILMENY,"But she saw till the sorrows of man were by,"
2145,KILMENY,And all was love and harmony;
2146,KILMENY,"Till the stars of heaven fell calmly away,"
2147,KILMENY,Like the flakes of snow on a winter day.
2148,KILMENY,
2149,KILMENY,*       *       *       *       *
2150,KILMENY,
2151,KILMENY,"When seven lang years had come and fled,"
2152,KILMENY,When grief was calm and hope was dead;
2153,KILMENY,"When scarce was remembered Kilmeny’s name,"
2154,KILMENY,"Late, late in a gloaming Kilmeny came hame!"
2155,KILMENY,"And O, her beauty was fair to see,"
2156,KILMENY,But still and steadfast was her ee!
2157,KILMENY,"Her seymar[20] was the lily flower,"
2158,KILMENY,And her cheek the moss-rose in the shower;
2159,KILMENY,And her voice like the distant melody
2160,KILMENY,That floats along the twilight sea.
2161,KILMENY,"But she loved to raike[21] the lanely glen,"
2162,KILMENY,And keepit away frae the haunts of men;
2163,KILMENY,"Her holy hymns unheard to sing,"
2164,KILMENY,"To suck the flowers, and drink the spring."
2165,KILMENY,"But wherever her peaceful form appear’d,"
2166,KILMENY,The wild beasts of the hill were cheer’d;
2167,KILMENY,"The wolf play’d blythly round the field,"
2168,KILMENY,The lordly bison low’d and kneel’d;
2169,KILMENY,"The dun deer woo’d with manner bland,"
2170,KILMENY,And cower’d aneath her lily hand.
2171,KILMENY,And all in a peaceful ring were hurl’d;
2172,KILMENY,It was like an eve in a sinless world!
2173,KILMENY,
2174,KILMENY,"When a month and a day had come and gane,"
2175,KILMENY,Kilmeny sought the green-wood wene;
2176,KILMENY,"There laid her down on the leaves sae green,"
2177,KILMENY,And Kilmeny on earth was never mair seen.

2826,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2827,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2828,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,"
2829,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
2830,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,"
2831,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
2832,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2833,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,"
2834,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
2835,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,"
2836,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,That host on the morrow lay wither’d and strown.
2837,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2838,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,"
2839,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
2840,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,"
2841,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!"
2842,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2843,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,"
2844,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:
2845,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,"
2846,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
2847,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2848,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And there lay the rider distorted and pale,"
2849,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail;
2850,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,"
2851,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown."
2852,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,
2853,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,"
2854,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
2855,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,"And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,"
2856,THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB,Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!

2872,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2873,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Up from the south at break of day,"
2874,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay,"
2875,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"The affrighted air with a shudder bore,"
2876,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain’s door,"
2877,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"The terrible grumble and rumble and roar,"
2878,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Telling the battle was on once more--
2879,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,And Sheridan twenty miles away!
2880,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2881,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,And wilder still those billows of war
2882,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Thundered along the horizon’s bar;
2883,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,And louder yet into Winchester rolled
2884,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,"
2885,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Making the blood of the listener cold
2886,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,"
2887,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,With Sheridan twenty miles away!
2888,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2889,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"But there is a road from Winchester town,"
2890,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,A good broad highway leading down;
2891,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"And there, through the flash of the morning light,"
2892,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"A steed, as black as the steeds of night,"
2893,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Was seen to pass as with eagle flight.
2894,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"As if he knew the terrible need,"
2895,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,He stretched away with his utmost speed;
2896,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Hills rose and fell, but his heart was gay,"
2897,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,With Sheridan fifteen miles away!
2898,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2899,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Still sprang from those swift hoofs, thundering south,"
2900,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"The dust, like the smoke from the cannon’s mouth,"
2901,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Or the trail of a comet sweeping faster and faster,"
2902,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster;
2903,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
2904,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,"
2905,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;
2906,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,"
2907,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,With Sheridan only ten miles away!
2908,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2909,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,The first that the General saw was the groups
2910,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Of stragglers, and then--the retreating troops!"
2911,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,What was done--what to do--a glance told him both;
2912,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"And, striking his spurs, with a terrible oath"
2913,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"He dashed down the line ’mid a storm of huzzahs,"
2914,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"And the wave of retreat checked its course there, because"
2915,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,The sight of the Master compelled it to pause.
2916,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,With foam and with dust the black charger was grey;
2917,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,By the flash of his eye and his red nostril’s play
2918,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,He seemed to the whole great army to say
2919,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"“I have brought you Sheridan, all the way"
2920,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,From Winchester town to save the day!”
2921,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,
2922,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Hurrah, hurrah, for Sheridan!"
2923,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Hurrah, hurrah, for horse and man!"
2924,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,And when their statues are placed on high
2925,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,Under the dome of the Union sky
2926,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,--The American soldier’s Temple of Fame--
2927,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"There, with the glorious General’s name,"
2928,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"Be it said in letters both bold and bright,"
2929,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,“Here is the steed that saved the day
2930,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,"By carrying Sheridan into the fight,"
2931,SHERIDAN’S RIDE,From Winchester--twenty miles away!”

2941,COLUMBUS,"Behind him lay the gray Azores,"
2942,COLUMBUS,"Behind, the Gates of Hercules;"
2943,COLUMBUS,Before him not the ghost of shores;
2944,COLUMBUS,Before him only shoreless seas.
2945,COLUMBUS,"The good mate said: “Now must we pray,"
2946,COLUMBUS,For lo! the very stars are gone.
2947,COLUMBUS,"Brave Admiral, speak; what shall I say?”"
2948,COLUMBUS,"“Why, say ‘Sail on! sail on! and on!’”"
2949,COLUMBUS,
2950,COLUMBUS,“My men grow mutinous day by day;
2951,COLUMBUS,"My men grow ghastly, wan and weak.”"
2952,COLUMBUS,The stout mate thought of home; a spray
2953,COLUMBUS,Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.
2954,COLUMBUS,"“What shall I say, brave Admiral, say,"
2955,COLUMBUS,If we sight naught but seas at dawn?”
2956,COLUMBUS,"“Why, you shall say at break of day:"
2957,COLUMBUS,‘Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!’”
2958,COLUMBUS,
2959,COLUMBUS,"They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow,"
2960,COLUMBUS,Until at last the blanched mate said:
2961,COLUMBUS,"“Why, now not even God would know"
2962,COLUMBUS,Should I and all my men fall dead.
2963,COLUMBUS,"These very winds forget their way,"
2964,COLUMBUS,For God from these dread seas is gone.
2965,COLUMBUS,"Now speak, brave Admiral, speak and say--”"
2966,COLUMBUS,He said: “Sail on! sail on! and on!”
2967,COLUMBUS,
2968,COLUMBUS,They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:
2969,COLUMBUS,“This mad sea shows his teeth to-night.
2970,COLUMBUS,"He curls his lip, he lies in wait,"
2971,COLUMBUS,He lifts his teeth as if to bite!
2972,COLUMBUS,"Brave Admiral, say but one good word:"
2973,COLUMBUS,What shall we do when hope is gone?”
2974,COLUMBUS,The words leapt like a leaping sword:
2975,COLUMBUS,“Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!”
2976,COLUMBUS,
2977,COLUMBUS,"Then, pale and worn, he paced his deck,"
2978,COLUMBUS,"And peered through darkness. Ah, that night"
2979,COLUMBUS,Of all dark nights! And then a speck--
2980,COLUMBUS,A light! A light! At last a light!
2981,COLUMBUS,"It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!"
2982,COLUMBUS,It grew to be Time’s burst of dawn.
2983,COLUMBUS,He gained a world; he gave that world
2984,COLUMBUS,Its grandest lesson: “On! sail on!”

3007,HORATIUS,Should suffer wrong no more.
3008,HORATIUS,"By the Nine Gods he swore it,"
3009,HORATIUS,"And named a trysting day,"
3010,HORATIUS,And bade his messengers ride forth
3011,HORATIUS,East and west and south and north
3012,HORATIUS,To summon his array.
3013,HORATIUS,
3014,HORATIUS,East and west and south and north
3015,HORATIUS,"The messengers ride fast,"
3016,HORATIUS,And tower and town and cottage
3017,HORATIUS,Have heard the trumpet’s blast.
3018,HORATIUS,Shame on the false Etruscan
3019,HORATIUS,"Who lingers in his home,"
3020,HORATIUS,When Porsena of Clusium
3021,HORATIUS,Is on the march for Rome.
3022,HORATIUS,
3023,HORATIUS,The horsemen and the footmen
3024,HORATIUS,Are pouring in amain
3025,HORATIUS,"From many a stately market-place,"
3026,HORATIUS,From many a fruitful plain;
3027,HORATIUS,From many a lonely hamlet
3028,HORATIUS,"Which, hid by beech and pine,"
3029,HORATIUS,Like an eagle’s nest hangs on the crest
3030,HORATIUS,Of purple Apennine;
3031,HORATIUS,
3032,HORATIUS,"From lordly Volaterræ,"
3033,HORATIUS,Where scowls the far-famed hold
3034,HORATIUS,Piled by the hands of giants
3035,HORATIUS,For godlike kings of old;
3036,HORATIUS,From sea-girt Populonia
3037,HORATIUS,Whose sentinels descry
3038,HORATIUS,Sardinia’s snowy mountain-tops
3039,HORATIUS,Fringing the southern sky;
3040,HORATIUS,
3041,HORATIUS,"From the proud mart of Pisæ,"
3042,HORATIUS,"Queen of the western waves,"
3043,HORATIUS,Where ride Massilia’s triremes
3044,HORATIUS,Heavy with fair-haired slaves;
3045,HORATIUS,From where sweet Clanis wanders
3046,HORATIUS,Through corn and vines and flowers;
3047,HORATIUS,From where Cortona lifts to heaven
3048,HORATIUS,Her diadem of towers.
3049,HORATIUS,
3050,HORATIUS,Tall are the oaks whose acorns
3051,HORATIUS,Drop in dark Auser’s rill;
3052,HORATIUS,Fat are the stags that champ the boughs
3053,HORATIUS,Of the Ciminian hill;
3054,HORATIUS,Beyond all streams Clitumnus
3055,HORATIUS,Is to the herdsman dear;
3056,HORATIUS,Best of all pools the fowler loves
3057,HORATIUS,The great Volsinian mere.
3058,HORATIUS,
3059,HORATIUS,But now no stroke of woodman
3060,HORATIUS,Is heard by Auser’s rill;
3061,HORATIUS,No hunter tracks the stag’s green path
3062,HORATIUS,Up the Ciminian hill;
3063,HORATIUS,Unwatched along Clitumnus
3064,HORATIUS,Grazes the milk-white steer;
3065,HORATIUS,Unharmed the water-fowl may dip
3066,HORATIUS,In the Volsinian mere.
3067,HORATIUS,
3068,HORATIUS,The harvests of Arretium
3069,HORATIUS,This year old men shall reap;
3070,HORATIUS,This year young boys in Umbro
3071,HORATIUS,Shall plunge the struggling sheep;
3072,HORATIUS,And in the vats of Luna
3073,HORATIUS,This year the must[24] shall foam
3074,HORATIUS,Round the white feet of laughing girls
3075,HORATIUS,Whose sires have marched to Rome.
3076,HORATIUS,
3077,HORATIUS,"There be thirty chosen prophets,"
3078,HORATIUS,"The wisest of the land,"
3079,HORATIUS,Who always by Lars Porsena
3080,HORATIUS,Both morn and evening stand:
3081,HORATIUS,Evening and morn the Thirty
3082,HORATIUS,"Have turned the verses o’er,"
3083,HORATIUS,Traced from the right on linen white
3084,HORATIUS,By mighty Seers of yore.
3085,HORATIUS,
3086,HORATIUS,And with one voice the Thirty
3087,HORATIUS,Have their glad answer given:
3088,HORATIUS,"“Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;"
3089,HORATIUS,"Go forth, beloved of Heaven;"
3090,HORATIUS,"Go, and return in glory"
3091,HORATIUS,"To Clusium’s royal dome,"
3092,HORATIUS,And hang round Nurscia’s altars
3093,HORATIUS,The golden shields of Rome.”
3094,HORATIUS,
3095,HORATIUS,And now hath every city
3096,HORATIUS,Sent up her tale of men;
3097,HORATIUS,"The foot are fourscore thousand,"
3098,HORATIUS,The horse are thousands ten.
3099,HORATIUS,Before the gates of Sutrium
3100,HORATIUS,Is met the great array.
3101,HORATIUS,A proud man was Lars Porsena
3102,HORATIUS,Upon the trysting day!
3103,HORATIUS,
3104,HORATIUS,For all the Etruscan armies
3105,HORATIUS,"Were ranged beneath his eye,"
3106,HORATIUS,"And many a banished Roman,"
3107,HORATIUS,And many a stout ally;
3108,HORATIUS,And with a mighty following
3109,HORATIUS,To join the muster came
3110,HORATIUS,"The Tusculan Mamilius,"
3111,HORATIUS,Prince of the Latian name.
3112,HORATIUS,
3113,HORATIUS,But by the yellow Tiber
3114,HORATIUS,Was tumult and affright:
3115,HORATIUS,From all the spacious champaign
3116,HORATIUS,To Rome men took their flight.
3117,HORATIUS,A mile around the city
3118,HORATIUS,The throng stopped up the ways;
3119,HORATIUS,"A fearful sight it was to see,"
3120,HORATIUS,Through two long nights and days.
3121,HORATIUS,
3122,HORATIUS,"For agèd folk on crutches,"
3123,HORATIUS,"And women great with child,"
3124,HORATIUS,And mothers sobbing over babes
3125,HORATIUS,"That clung to them and smiled,"
3126,HORATIUS,And sick men borne in litters
3127,HORATIUS,"High on the necks of slaves,"
3128,HORATIUS,And troops of sun-burned husbandmen
3129,HORATIUS,"With reaping-hooks and staves,"
3130,HORATIUS,
3131,HORATIUS,And droves of mules and asses
3132,HORATIUS,"Laden with skins of wine,"
3133,HORATIUS,"And endless flocks of goats and sheep,"
3134,HORATIUS,"And endless herds of kine,"
3135,HORATIUS,And endless trains of waggons
3136,HORATIUS,That creaked beneath the weight
3137,HORATIUS,"Of corn-sacks and of household goods,"
3138,HORATIUS,Choked every roaring gate.
3139,HORATIUS,
3140,HORATIUS,Now from the rock Tarpeian
3141,HORATIUS,Could the wan burghers spy
3142,HORATIUS,The line of blazing villages
3143,HORATIUS,Red in the midnight sky.
3144,HORATIUS,"The Fathers of the City,"
3145,HORATIUS,"They sat all night and day,"
3146,HORATIUS,For every hour some horseman came
3147,HORATIUS,With tidings of dismay.
3148,HORATIUS,
3149,HORATIUS,To eastward and to westward
3150,HORATIUS,Have spread the Tuscan bands;
3151,HORATIUS,"Nor house, nor fence, nor dovecote"
3152,HORATIUS,In Crustumerium stands.
3153,HORATIUS,Verbenna down to Ostia
3154,HORATIUS,Hath wasted all the plain;
3155,HORATIUS,"Astur hath stormed Janiculum,"
3156,HORATIUS,And the stout guards are slain.
3157,HORATIUS,
3158,HORATIUS,"I wis, in all the Senate"
3159,HORATIUS,There was no heart so bold
3160,HORATIUS,"But sore it ached, and fast it beat,"
3161,HORATIUS,When that ill news was told.
3162,HORATIUS,"Forthwith up rose the Consul,"
3163,HORATIUS,Up rose the Fathers all;
3164,HORATIUS,"In haste they girded up their gowns,"
3165,HORATIUS,And hied them to the wall.
3166,HORATIUS,
3167,HORATIUS,They held a council standing
3168,HORATIUS,Before the River-Gate;
3169,HORATIUS,"Short time was there, ye well may guess,"
3170,HORATIUS,For musing or debate.
3171,HORATIUS,Out spake the Consul roundly:
3172,HORATIUS,“The bridge must straight go down;
3173,HORATIUS,"For, since Janiculum is lost,"
3174,HORATIUS,Nought else can save the town.”
3175,HORATIUS,
3176,HORATIUS,"Just then a scout came flying,"
3177,HORATIUS,All wild with haste and fear:
3178,HORATIUS,“To arms! to arms! Sir Consul:
3179,HORATIUS,Lars Porsena is here.”
3180,HORATIUS,On the low hills to westward
3181,HORATIUS,"The Consul fixed his eye,"
3182,HORATIUS,And saw the swarthy storm of dust
3183,HORATIUS,Rise fast along the sky.
3184,HORATIUS,
3185,HORATIUS,And nearer fast and nearer
3186,HORATIUS,Doth the red whirlwind come;
3187,HORATIUS,And louder still and still more loud
3188,HORATIUS,From underneath that rolling cloud
3189,HORATIUS,"Is heard the trumpet’s war-note proud,"
3190,HORATIUS,"The trampling, and the hum."
3191,HORATIUS,And plainly and more plainly
3192,HORATIUS,"Now through the gloom appears,"
3193,HORATIUS,"Far to left and far to right,"
3194,HORATIUS,"In broken gleams of dark-blue light,"
3195,HORATIUS,"The long array of helmets bright,"
3196,HORATIUS,The long array of spears.
3197,HORATIUS,
3198,HORATIUS,And plainly and more plainly
3199,HORATIUS,Above that glimmering line
3200,HORATIUS,Now might ye see the banners
3201,HORATIUS,Of twelve fair cities shine;
3202,HORATIUS,But the banner of proud Clusium
3203,HORATIUS,"Was highest of them all,"
3204,HORATIUS,"The terror of the Umbrian,"
3205,HORATIUS,The terror of the Gaul.
3206,HORATIUS,
3207,HORATIUS,And plainly and more plainly
3208,HORATIUS,"Now might the burghers know,"
3209,HORATIUS,"By port and vest, by horse and crest,"
3210,HORATIUS,Each warlike Lucumo[25].
3211,HORATIUS,There Cilnius of Arretium
3212,HORATIUS,On his fleet roan was seen;
3213,HORATIUS,"And Astur of the fourfold shield,"
3214,HORATIUS,"Girt with the brand none else may wield,"
3215,HORATIUS,"Tolumnius with the belt of gold,"
3216,HORATIUS,And dark Verbenna from the hold
3217,HORATIUS,By reedy Thrasymene.
3218,HORATIUS,
3219,HORATIUS,Fast by the royal standard
3220,HORATIUS,"O’erlooking all the war,"
3221,HORATIUS,Lars Porsena of Clusium
3222,HORATIUS,Sate in his ivory car.
3223,HORATIUS,"By the right wheel rode Mamilius,"
3224,HORATIUS,Prince of the Latian name;
3225,HORATIUS,"And by the left false Sextus,"
3226,HORATIUS,That wrought the deed of shame.
3227,HORATIUS,
3228,HORATIUS,But when the face of Sextus
3229,HORATIUS,"Was seen among the foes,"
3230,HORATIUS,A yell that rent the firmament
3231,HORATIUS,From all the town arose.
3232,HORATIUS,On the house-tops was no woman
3233,HORATIUS,"But spat towards him, and hissed;"
3234,HORATIUS,"No child but screamed out curses,"
3235,HORATIUS,And shook its little fist.
3236,HORATIUS,
3237,HORATIUS,"But the Consul’s brow was sad,"
3238,HORATIUS,"And the Consul’s speech was low,"
3239,HORATIUS,"And darkly looked he at the wall,"
3240,HORATIUS,And darkly at the foe.
3241,HORATIUS,“Their van will be upon us
3242,HORATIUS,Before the bridge goes down;
3243,HORATIUS,"And if they once may win the bridge,"
3244,HORATIUS,What hope to save the town?”
3245,HORATIUS,
3246,HORATIUS,"Then out spake brave Horatius,"
3247,HORATIUS,The Captain of the gate:
3248,HORATIUS,“To every man upon this earth
3249,HORATIUS,Death cometh soon or late;
3250,HORATIUS,And how can man die better
3251,HORATIUS,Than facing fearful odds
3252,HORATIUS,For the ashes of his fathers
3253,HORATIUS,"And the temples of his Gods,"
3254,HORATIUS,
3255,HORATIUS,And for the tender mother
3256,HORATIUS,"Who dandled him to rest,"
3257,HORATIUS,And for the wife who nurses
3258,HORATIUS,"His baby at her breast,"
3259,HORATIUS,And for the holy maidens
3260,HORATIUS,"Who feed the eternal flame,"
3261,HORATIUS,To save them from false Sextus
3262,HORATIUS,That wrought the deed of shame?
3263,HORATIUS,
3264,HORATIUS,"Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,"
3265,HORATIUS,With all the speed ye may;
3266,HORATIUS,"I, with two more to help me,"
3267,HORATIUS,Will hold the foe in play.
3268,HORATIUS,In yon strait path a thousand
3269,HORATIUS,May well be stopped by three:
3270,HORATIUS,"Now who will stand on either hand,"
3271,HORATIUS,And keep the bridge with me?”
3272,HORATIUS,
3273,HORATIUS,"Then out spake Spurius Lartius,"
3274,HORATIUS,A Ramnian proud was he:
3275,HORATIUS,"“Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,"
3276,HORATIUS,And keep the bridge with thee.”
3277,HORATIUS,"And out spake strong Herminius,"
3278,HORATIUS,Of Titian blood was he:
3279,HORATIUS,"“I will abide on thy left side,"
3280,HORATIUS,And keep the bridge with thee.”
3281,HORATIUS,
3282,HORATIUS,"“Horatius,” quoth the Consul,"
3283,HORATIUS,"“As thou sayest, so let it be.”"
3284,HORATIUS,And straight against that great array
3285,HORATIUS,Forth went the dauntless Three.
3286,HORATIUS,For Romans in Rome’s quarrel
3287,HORATIUS,"Spared neither land nor gold,"
3288,HORATIUS,"Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life"
3289,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.
3290,HORATIUS,
3291,HORATIUS,Then none was for a party;
3292,HORATIUS,Then all were for the State;
3293,HORATIUS,"Then the great man helped the poor,"
3294,HORATIUS,And the poor man loved the great;
3295,HORATIUS,Then lands were fairly portioned;
3296,HORATIUS,Then spoils were fairly sold;
3297,HORATIUS,The Romans were like brothers
3298,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.
3299,HORATIUS,
3300,HORATIUS,Now Roman is to Roman
3301,HORATIUS,"More hateful than a foe,"
3302,HORATIUS,"And the Tribunes beard the high,"
3303,HORATIUS,And the Fathers grind the low.
3304,HORATIUS,"As we wax hot in faction,"
3305,HORATIUS,In battle we wax cold:
3306,HORATIUS,Wherefore men fight not as they fought
3307,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.
3308,HORATIUS,
3309,HORATIUS,Now while the Three were tightening
3310,HORATIUS,"Their harness on their backs,"
3311,HORATIUS,The Consul was the foremost man
3312,HORATIUS,To take in hand an axe:
3313,HORATIUS,And Fathers mixed with Commons
3314,HORATIUS,"Seized hatchet, bar, and crow,"
3315,HORATIUS,"And smote upon the planks above,"
3316,HORATIUS,And loosed the props below.
3317,HORATIUS,
3318,HORATIUS,"Meanwhile the Tuscan army,"
3319,HORATIUS,"Right glorious to behold,"
3320,HORATIUS,"Came flashing back the noonday light,"
3321,HORATIUS,"Rank behind rank, like surges bright"
3322,HORATIUS,Of a broad sea of gold.
3323,HORATIUS,Four hundred trumpets sounded
3324,HORATIUS,"A peal of warlike glee,"
3325,HORATIUS,"As that great host, with measured tread,"
3326,HORATIUS,"And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,"
3327,HORATIUS,"Rolled slowly towards the bridge’s head,"
3328,HORATIUS,Where stood the dauntless Three.
3329,HORATIUS,
3330,HORATIUS,"The Three stood calm and silent,"
3331,HORATIUS,"And looked upon the foes,"
3332,HORATIUS,And a great shout of laughter
3333,HORATIUS,From all the vanguard rose:
3334,HORATIUS,And forth three chiefs came spurring
3335,HORATIUS,Before that deep array;
3336,HORATIUS,"To earth they sprang, their swords they drew,"
3337,HORATIUS,"And lifted high their shields, and flew"
3338,HORATIUS,To win the narrow way;
3339,HORATIUS,
3340,HORATIUS,"Aunus from green Tifernum,"
3341,HORATIUS,Lord of the Hill of Vines;
3342,HORATIUS,"And Seius, whose eight hundred slaves"
3343,HORATIUS,Sicken in Ilva’s mines;
3344,HORATIUS,"And Picus, long to Clusium"
3345,HORATIUS,"Vassal in peace and war,"
3346,HORATIUS,Who led to fight his Umbrian powers
3347,HORATIUS,"From that grey crag where, girt with towers,"
3348,HORATIUS,The fortress of Nequinum lowers
3349,HORATIUS,O’er the pale waves of Nar.
3350,HORATIUS,
3351,HORATIUS,Stout Lartius hurled down Aunus
3352,HORATIUS,Into the stream beneath:
3353,HORATIUS,"Herminius struck at Seius,"
3354,HORATIUS,And clove him to the teeth:
3355,HORATIUS,At Picus brave Horatius
3356,HORATIUS,"Darted one fiery thrust,"
3357,HORATIUS,And the proud Umbrian’s gilded arms
3358,HORATIUS,Clashed in the bloody dust.
3359,HORATIUS,
3360,HORATIUS,Then Ocnus of Falerii
3361,HORATIUS,Rushed on the Roman Three;
3362,HORATIUS,"And Lausulus of Urgo,"
3363,HORATIUS,The rover of the sea;
3364,HORATIUS,"And Aruns of Volsinium,"
3365,HORATIUS,"Who slew the great wild boar,"
3366,HORATIUS,The great wild boar that had his den
3367,HORATIUS,"Amidst the reeds of Cosa’s fen,"
3368,HORATIUS,"And wasted fields, and slaughtered men,"
3369,HORATIUS,Along Albinia’s shore.
3370,HORATIUS,
3371,HORATIUS,Herminius smote down Aruns:
3372,HORATIUS,Lartius laid Ocnus low:
3373,HORATIUS,Right to the heart of Lausulus
3374,HORATIUS,Horatius sent a blow.
3375,HORATIUS,"“Lie there,” he cried, “fell pirate!"
3376,HORATIUS,"No more, aghast and pale,"
3377,HORATIUS,From Ostia’s walls the crowd shall mark
3378,HORATIUS,The track of thy destroying bark.
3379,HORATIUS,No more Campania’s hinds shall fly
3380,HORATIUS,To woods and caverns when they spy
3381,HORATIUS,Thy thrice-accursed sail.”
3382,HORATIUS,
3383,HORATIUS,But now no sound of laughter
3384,HORATIUS,Was heard amongst the foes.
3385,HORATIUS,A wild and wrathful clamour
3386,HORATIUS,From all the vanguard rose.
3387,HORATIUS,Six spears’ lengths from the entrance
3388,HORATIUS,"Halted that deep array,"
3389,HORATIUS,And for a space no man came forth
3390,HORATIUS,To win the narrow way.
3391,HORATIUS,
3392,HORATIUS,But hark! the cry is “Astur!”
3393,HORATIUS,And lo! the ranks divide;
3394,HORATIUS,And the great Lord of Luna
3395,HORATIUS,Comes with his stately stride.
3396,HORATIUS,Upon his ample shoulders
3397,HORATIUS,"Clangs loud the fourfold shield,"
3398,HORATIUS,And in his hand he shakes the brand
3399,HORATIUS,Which none but he can wield.
3400,HORATIUS,
3401,HORATIUS,He smiled on those bold Romans
3402,HORATIUS,A smile serene and high;
3403,HORATIUS,"He eyed the flinching Tuscans,"
3404,HORATIUS,And scorn was in his eye.
3405,HORATIUS,"Quoth he, “The she-wolf’s litter"
3406,HORATIUS,Stand savagely at bay:
3407,HORATIUS,"But will ye dare to follow,"
3408,HORATIUS,If Astur clears the way?”
3409,HORATIUS,
3410,HORATIUS,"Then, whirling up his broadsword"
3411,HORATIUS,"With both hands to the height,"
3412,HORATIUS,"He rushed against Horatius,"
3413,HORATIUS,And smote with all his might.
3414,HORATIUS,With shield and blade Horatius
3415,HORATIUS,Right deftly turned the blow:
3416,HORATIUS,"The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh;"
3417,HORATIUS,"It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh:"
3418,HORATIUS,The Tuscans raised a joyful cry
3419,HORATIUS,To see the red blood flow.
3420,HORATIUS,
3421,HORATIUS,"He reeled, and on Herminius"
3422,HORATIUS,He leaned one breathing-space;
3423,HORATIUS,"Then, like a wild cat mad with wounds,"
3424,HORATIUS,Sprang right at Astur’s face.
3425,HORATIUS,"Through teeth, and skull, and helmet,"
3426,HORATIUS,"So fierce a thrust he sped,"
3427,HORATIUS,The good sword stood a handbreadth out
3428,HORATIUS,Behind the Tuscan’s head.
3429,HORATIUS,
3430,HORATIUS,And the great Lord of Luna
3431,HORATIUS,"Fell at that deadly stroke,"
3432,HORATIUS,As falls on Mount Alvernus
3433,HORATIUS,A thunder-smitten oak:
3434,HORATIUS,Far o’er the crashing forest
3435,HORATIUS,The giant arms lie spread;
3436,HORATIUS,"And the pale augurs, muttering low,"
3437,HORATIUS,Gaze on the blasted head.
3438,HORATIUS,
3439,HORATIUS,On Astur’s throat Horatius
3440,HORATIUS,"Right firmly pressed his heel,"
3441,HORATIUS,"And thrice and four times tugged amain,"
3442,HORATIUS,Ere he wrenched out the steel.
3443,HORATIUS,"“And see,” he cried, “the welcome,"
3444,HORATIUS,"Fair guests, that waits you here!"
3445,HORATIUS,What noble Lucumo comes next
3446,HORATIUS,To taste our Roman cheer?”
3447,HORATIUS,
3448,HORATIUS,But at his haughty challenge
3449,HORATIUS,"A sullen murmur ran,"
3450,HORATIUS,"Mingled of wrath and shame and dread,"
3451,HORATIUS,Along that glittering van.
3452,HORATIUS,"There lacked not men of prowess,"
3453,HORATIUS,Nor men of lordly race;
3454,HORATIUS,For all Etruria’s noblest
3455,HORATIUS,Were round the fatal place.
3456,HORATIUS,
3457,HORATIUS,But all Etruria’s noblest
3458,HORATIUS,Felt their hearts sink to see
3459,HORATIUS,"On the earth the bloody corpses,"
3460,HORATIUS,In the path the dauntless Three:
3461,HORATIUS,"And, from the ghastly entrance"
3462,HORATIUS,"Where those bold Romans stood,"
3463,HORATIUS,"All shrank, like boys who unaware,"
3464,HORATIUS,"Ranging the woods to start a hare,"
3465,HORATIUS,Come to the mouth of the dark lair
3466,HORATIUS,"Where, growling low, a fierce old bear"
3467,HORATIUS,Lies amidst bones and blood.
3468,HORATIUS,
3469,HORATIUS,Was none who would be foremost
3470,HORATIUS,To lead such dire attack;
3471,HORATIUS,But those behind cried “Forward!”
3472,HORATIUS,And those before cried “Back!”
3473,HORATIUS,And backward now and forward
3474,HORATIUS,Wavers the deep array;
3475,HORATIUS,"And on the tossing sea of steel,"
3476,HORATIUS,To and fro the standards reel;
3477,HORATIUS,And the victorious trumpet-peal
3478,HORATIUS,Dies fitfully away.
3479,HORATIUS,
3480,HORATIUS,Yet one man for one moment
3481,HORATIUS,Strode out before the crowd;
3482,HORATIUS,"Well known was he to all the Three,"
3483,HORATIUS,And they gave him greeting loud.
3484,HORATIUS,"“Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!"
3485,HORATIUS,Now welcome to thy home!
3486,HORATIUS,"Why dost thou stay, and turn away?"
3487,HORATIUS,Here lies the road to Rome.”
3488,HORATIUS,
3489,HORATIUS,Thrice looked he at the city;
3490,HORATIUS,Thrice looked he at the dead;
3491,HORATIUS,"And thrice came on in fury,"
3492,HORATIUS,And thrice turned back in dread:
3493,HORATIUS,"And, white with fear and hatred,"
3494,HORATIUS,Scowled at the narrow way
3495,HORATIUS,"Where, wallowing in a pool of blood,"
3496,HORATIUS,The bravest Tuscans lay.
3497,HORATIUS,
3498,HORATIUS,But meanwhile axe and lever
3499,HORATIUS,Have manfully been plied;
3500,HORATIUS,And now the bridge hangs tottering
3501,HORATIUS,Above the boiling tide.
3502,HORATIUS,"“Come back, come back, Horatius!”"
3503,HORATIUS,Loud cried the Fathers all.
3504,HORATIUS,"“Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!"
3505,HORATIUS,"Back, ere the ruin fall!”"
3506,HORATIUS,
3507,HORATIUS,Back darted Spurius Lartius;
3508,HORATIUS,Herminius darted back:
3509,HORATIUS,"And, as they passed, beneath their feet"
3510,HORATIUS,They felt the timbers crack.
3511,HORATIUS,"But, when they turned their faces,"
3512,HORATIUS,And on the farther shore
3513,HORATIUS,"Saw brave Horatius stand alone,"
3514,HORATIUS,They would have crossed once more.
3515,HORATIUS,
3516,HORATIUS,But with a crash like thunder
3517,HORATIUS,"Fell every loosened beam,"
3518,HORATIUS,"And, like a dam the mighty wreck"
3519,HORATIUS,Lay right athwart the stream:
3520,HORATIUS,And a long shout of triumph
3521,HORATIUS,"Rose from the walls of Rome,"
3522,HORATIUS,As to the highest turret-tops
3523,HORATIUS,Was splashed the yellow foam.
3524,HORATIUS,
3525,HORATIUS,"And, like a horse unbroken"
3526,HORATIUS,"When first he feels the rein,"
3527,HORATIUS,"The furious river struggled hard,"
3528,HORATIUS,And tossed his tawny mane;
3529,HORATIUS,"And burst the curb, and bounded,"
3530,HORATIUS,Rejoicing to be free;
3531,HORATIUS,"And whirling down, in fierce career,"
3532,HORATIUS,"Battlement, and plank, and pier,"
3533,HORATIUS,Rushed headlong to the sea.
3534,HORATIUS,
3535,HORATIUS,"Alone stood brave Horatius,"
3536,HORATIUS,But constant still in mind;
3537,HORATIUS,"Thrice thirty thousand foes before,"
3538,HORATIUS,And the broad flood behind.
3539,HORATIUS,"“Down with him!” cried false Sextus,"
3540,HORATIUS,With a smile on his pale face.
3541,HORATIUS,"“Now yield thee,” cried Lars Porsena,"
3542,HORATIUS,“Now yield thee to our grace.”
3543,HORATIUS,
3544,HORATIUS,"Round turned he, as not deigning"
3545,HORATIUS,Those craven ranks to see;
3546,HORATIUS,"Nought spake he to Lars Porsena,"
3547,HORATIUS,To Sextus nought spake he;
3548,HORATIUS,But he saw on Palatinus
3549,HORATIUS,The white porch of his home;
3550,HORATIUS,And he spake to the noble river
3551,HORATIUS,That rolls by the towers of Rome.
3552,HORATIUS,
3553,HORATIUS,“O Tiber! father Tiber!
3554,HORATIUS,"To whom the Romans pray,"
3555,HORATIUS,"A Roman’s life, a Roman’s arms"
3556,HORATIUS,Take thou in charge this day!”
3557,HORATIUS,"So he spake, and speaking sheathèd"
3558,HORATIUS,"The good sword by his side,"
3559,HORATIUS,And with his harness on his back
3560,HORATIUS,Plunged headlong in the tide.
3561,HORATIUS,
3562,HORATIUS,No sound of joy or sorrow
3563,HORATIUS,Was heard from either bank;
3564,HORATIUS,"But friends and foes in dumb surprise,"
3565,HORATIUS,"With parted lips and straining eyes,"
3566,HORATIUS,Stood gazing where he sank;
3567,HORATIUS,And when above the surges
3568,HORATIUS,"They saw his crest appear,"
3569,HORATIUS,"All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,"
3570,HORATIUS,And even the ranks of Tuscany
3571,HORATIUS,Could scarce forbear to cheer.
3572,HORATIUS,
3573,HORATIUS,"But fiercely ran the current,"
3574,HORATIUS,Swollen high by months of rain:
3575,HORATIUS,And fast his blood was flowing;
3576,HORATIUS,"And he was sore in pain,"
3577,HORATIUS,"And heavy with his armour,"
3578,HORATIUS,And spent with changing blows:
3579,HORATIUS,"And oft they thought him sinking,"
3580,HORATIUS,But still again he rose.
3581,HORATIUS,
3582,HORATIUS,"Never, I ween, did swimmer,"
3583,HORATIUS,"In such an evil case,"
3584,HORATIUS,Struggle through such a raging flood
3585,HORATIUS,Safe to the landing-place:
3586,HORATIUS,But his limbs were borne up bravely
3587,HORATIUS,"By the brave heart within,"
3588,HORATIUS,And our good father Tiber
3589,HORATIUS,Bare bravely up his chin.
3590,HORATIUS,
3591,HORATIUS,“Curse on him!” quoth false Sextus;
3592,HORATIUS,“Will not the villain drown?
3593,HORATIUS,But for this stay ere close of day
3594,HORATIUS,We should have sacked the town!”
3595,HORATIUS,"“Heaven help him!” quoth Lars Porsena,"
3596,HORATIUS,“And bring him safe to shore;
3597,HORATIUS,For such a gallant feat of arms
3598,HORATIUS,Was never seen before.”
3599,HORATIUS,
3600,HORATIUS,And now he feels the bottom;
3601,HORATIUS,Now on dry earth he stands;
3602,HORATIUS,Now round him throng the Fathers
3603,HORATIUS,To press his gory hands;
3604,HORATIUS,"And now with shouts and clapping,"
3605,HORATIUS,"And noise of weeping loud,"
3606,HORATIUS,"He enters through the River-Gate,"
3607,HORATIUS,Borne by the joyous crowd.
3608,HORATIUS,
3609,HORATIUS,"They gave him of the corn-land,"
3610,HORATIUS,"That was of public right,"
3611,HORATIUS,As much as two strong oxen
3612,HORATIUS,Could plough from morn till night;
3613,HORATIUS,"And they made a molten image,"
3614,HORATIUS,"And set it up on high,"
3615,HORATIUS,And there it stands unto this day
3616,HORATIUS,To witness if I lie.
3617,HORATIUS,
3618,HORATIUS,It stands in the Comitium
3619,HORATIUS,Plain for all folk to see;
3620,HORATIUS,"Horatius in his harness,"
3621,HORATIUS,Halting upon one knee:
3622,HORATIUS,"And underneath is written,"
3623,HORATIUS,"In letters all of gold,"
3624,HORATIUS,How valiantly he kept the bridge
3625,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.
3626,HORATIUS,
3627,HORATIUS,And still his name sounds stirring
3628,HORATIUS,"Unto the men of Rome,"
3629,HORATIUS,As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
3630,HORATIUS,To charge the Volscian home;
3631,HORATIUS,And wives still pray to Juno
3632,HORATIUS,For boys with hearts as bold
3633,HORATIUS,As his who kept the bridge so well
3634,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.
3635,HORATIUS,
3636,HORATIUS,"And in the nights of winter,"
3637,HORATIUS,"When the cold north winds blow,"
3638,HORATIUS,And the long howling of the wolves
3639,HORATIUS,Is heard amidst the snow;
3640,HORATIUS,When round the lonely cottage
3641,HORATIUS,"Roars loud the tempest’s din,"
3642,HORATIUS,And the good logs of Algidus
3643,HORATIUS,Roar louder yet within;
3644,HORATIUS,
3645,HORATIUS,"When the oldest cask is opened,"
3646,HORATIUS,And the largest lamp is lit;
3647,HORATIUS,"When the chestnuts glow in the embers,"
3648,HORATIUS,And the kid turns on the spit;
3649,HORATIUS,When young and old in circle
3650,HORATIUS,Around the firebrands close;
3651,HORATIUS,"When the girls are weaving baskets,"
3652,HORATIUS,And the lads are shaping bows;
3653,HORATIUS,
3654,HORATIUS,When the goodman mends his armour
3655,HORATIUS,And trims his helmet’s plume;
3656,HORATIUS,When the goodwife’s shuttle merrily
3657,HORATIUS,Goes flashing through the loom;
3658,HORATIUS,With weeping and with laughter
3659,HORATIUS,"Still is the story told,"
3660,HORATIUS,How well Horatius kept the bridge
3661,HORATIUS,In the brave days of old.

4133,THE BROOK,
4134,THE BROOK,"I come from haunts of coot and hern[26],"
4135,THE BROOK,"I make a sudden sally,"
4136,THE BROOK,"And sparkle out among the fern,"
4137,THE BROOK,To bicker down a valley.
4138,THE BROOK,
4139,THE BROOK,"By thirty hills I hurry down,"
4140,THE BROOK,"Or slip between the ridges,"
4141,THE BROOK,"By twenty thorps[27], a little town,"
4142,THE BROOK,And half a hundred bridges.
4143,THE BROOK,
4144,THE BROOK,I chatter over stony ways
4145,THE BROOK,"In little sharps and trebles,"
4146,THE BROOK,"I bubble into eddying bays,"
4147,THE BROOK,I babble on the pebbles.
4148,THE BROOK,
4149,THE BROOK,With many a curve my banks I fret
4150,THE BROOK,"By many a field and fallow,"
4151,THE BROOK,And many a fairy foreland set
4152,THE BROOK,With willow-weed and mallow.
4153,THE BROOK,
4154,THE BROOK,"I chatter, chatter, as I flow"
4155,THE BROOK,"To join the brimming river,"
4156,THE BROOK,"For men may come and men may go,"
4157,THE BROOK,But I go on for ever.
4158,THE BROOK,
4159,THE BROOK,"I wind about and in and out,"
4160,THE BROOK,"With here a blossom sailing,"
4161,THE BROOK,"And here and there a lusty trout,"
4162,THE BROOK,And here and there a grayling.
4163,THE BROOK,
4164,THE BROOK,And here and there a foamy flake
4165,THE BROOK,"Upon me, as I travel"
4166,THE BROOK,With many a silvery waterbreak
4167,THE BROOK,Above the golden gravel.
4168,THE BROOK,
4169,THE BROOK,"I steal by lawns and grassy plots,"
4170,THE BROOK,I slide by hazel covers;
4171,THE BROOK,I move the sweet forget-me-nots
4172,THE BROOK,That grow for happy lovers.
4173,THE BROOK,
4174,THE BROOK,"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,"
4175,THE BROOK,Among my skimming swallows;
4176,THE BROOK,I make the netted sunbeam dance
4177,THE BROOK,Against my sandy shallows.
4178,THE BROOK,
4179,THE BROOK,I murmur under moon and stars
4180,THE BROOK,In brambly wildernesses;
4181,THE BROOK,I linger by my shingly bars;
4182,THE BROOK,I loiter round my cresses;
4183,THE BROOK,
4184,THE BROOK,And out again I curve and flow
4185,THE BROOK,"To join the brimming river,"

4202,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The earth, and every common sight,"
4203,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To me did seem
4204,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Apparell’d in celestial light,"
4205,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The glory and the freshness of a dream.
4206,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
4207,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Turn wheresoe’er I may,"
4208,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"By night or day,"
4209,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The things which I have seen I now can see no more.

4211,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The rainbow comes and goes,"
4212,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And lovely is the rose;

4214,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Look round her when the heavens are bare;
4215,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Waters on a starry night
4216,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Are beautiful and fair;
4217,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
4218,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"But yet I know, where’er I go,"
4219,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,That there hath passed away a glory from the earth.
4220,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
4221,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
4222,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And while the young lambs bound
4223,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"As to the tabor’s sound,"
4224,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
4225,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
4226,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And I again am strong.
4227,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
4228,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
4229,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,"
4230,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
4231,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And all the earth is gay;
4232,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Land and sea
4233,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
4234,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And with the heart of May
4235,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Doth every beast keep holiday;--
4236,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thou Child of Joy,"
4237,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!"
4238,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
4239,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Ye blessed creatures, I have heard the call"
4240,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Ye to each other make; I see
4241,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
4242,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"My heart is at your festival,"
4243,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"My head hath its coronal,"
4244,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all."
4245,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,O evil day! if I were sullen
4246,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"While Earth herself is adorning,"
4247,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"This sweet May morning,"
4248,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And the children are culling
4249,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"On every side,"
4250,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"In a thousand valleys far and wide,"
4251,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
4252,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,"
4253,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:--
4254,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
4255,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"--But there’s a tree, of many one,"
4256,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A single field which I have look’d upon,"
4257,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Both of them speak of something that is gone:
4258,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The pansy at my feet
4259,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Doth the same tale repeat:
4260,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
4261,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
4262,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
4263,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
4264,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,"
4265,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Hath had elsewhere its setting,"
4266,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And cometh from afar:
4267,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Not in entire forgetfulness,"
4268,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And not in utter nakedness,"
4269,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
4270,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"From God, who is our home:"
4271,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
4272,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
4273,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Upon the growing Boy,"
4274,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
4275,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,He sees it in his joy;
4276,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The Youth, who daily further from the east"
4277,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,"
4278,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And by the vision splendid
4279,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Is on his way attended;
4280,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"At length the man perceives it die away,"
4281,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And fade into the light of common day.

4310,TO AUTUMN,"Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,"
4311,TO AUTUMN,Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;

4313,TO AUTUMN,"Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook"
4314,TO AUTUMN,Spares the next swath and all its twinèd flowers;
4315,TO AUTUMN,And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
4316,TO AUTUMN,Steady thy laden head across a brook;
4317,TO AUTUMN,"Or by a cider-press, with patient look,"
4318,TO AUTUMN,Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

4320,TO AUTUMN,"Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?"
4321,TO AUTUMN,"Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,--"

4323,TO AUTUMN,And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
4324,TO AUTUMN,Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
4325,TO AUTUMN,"Among the river sallows[28], borne aloft"
4326,TO AUTUMN,Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
4327,TO AUTUMN,And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn[29];
4328,TO AUTUMN,Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
4329,TO AUTUMN,The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft[30];
4330,TO AUTUMN,And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

5231,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,The lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men.
5232,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,A thousand hearts beat happily; and when

5234,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Soft eyes look’d love to eyes which spake again,"
5235,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,And all went merry as a marriage-bell;

5237,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,
5238,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"Did ye not hear it?--No; ’twas but the wind,"

5241,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,"No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet"
5242,THE EVE OF WATERLOO,To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.

5876,III.,His broad clear brow in sunlight glow’d;
5877,III.,On burnish’d hooves his war-horse trode;
5878,III.,From underneath his helmet flow’d
5879,III.,"His coal-black curls as on he rode,"
5880,III.,As he rode down to Camelot.
5881,III.,From the bank and from the river
5882,III.,"He flash’d into the crystal mirror,"
5883,III.,"“Tirra lirra,” by the river"
5884,III.,Sang Sir Lancelot.
5885,III.,
5886,III.,"She left the web, she left the loom,"
5887,III.,"She made three paces thro’ the room,"
5888,III.,"She saw the water-lily bloom,"
5889,III.,"She saw the helmet and the plume,"
5890,III.,She look’d down to Camelot.
5891,III.,Out flew the web and floated wide;
5892,III.,The mirror crack’d from side to side;
5893,III.,"“The curse is come upon me,” cried"
5894,III.,The Lady of Shalott.
5895,III.,
5896,III.,
5897,IV.,IV.
5898,IV.,
5899,IV.,"In the stormy east-wind straining,"
5900,IV.,"The pale yellow woods were waning,"
5901,IV.,"The broad stream in his banks complaining,"
5902,IV.,Heavily the low sky raining
5903,IV.,Over tower’d Camelot;
5904,IV.,Down she came and found a boat
5905,IV.,"Beneath a willow left afloat,"
5906,IV.,And round about the prow she wrote
5907,IV.,_The Lady of Shalott_.
5908,IV.,
5909,IV.,And down the river’s dim expanse--
5910,IV.,"Like some bold seer in a trance,"
5911,IV.,Seeing all his own mischance--
5912,IV.,With a glassy countenance
5913,IV.,Did she look to Camelot.
5914,IV.,And at the closing of the day
5915,IV.,She loosed the chain and down she lay;
5916,IV.,"The broad stream bore her far away,"
5917,IV.,The Lady of Shalott.
5918,IV.,
5919,IV.,"Lying, robed in snowy white"
5920,IV.,That loosely flew to left and right--
5921,IV.,The leaves upon her falling light--
5922,IV.,Thro’ the noises of the night
5923,IV.,She floated down to Camelot:
5924,IV.,And as the boat-head wound along
5925,IV.,"The willowy hills and fields among,"
5926,IV.,"They heard her singing her last song,"
5927,IV.,The Lady of Shalott.
5928,IV.,
5929,IV.,"Heard a carol, mournful, holy,"
5930,IV.,"Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,"
5931,IV.,"Till her blood was frozen slowly,"
5932,IV.,"And her eyes were darken’d wholly,"
5933,IV.,Turn’d to tower’d Camelot.
5934,IV.,For ere she reached upon the tide
5935,IV.,"The first house by the water-side,"
5936,IV.,"Singing in her song she died,"
5937,IV.,The Lady of Shalott.
5938,IV.,
5939,IV.,"Under tower and balcony,"
5940,IV.,"By garden-wall and gallery,"
5941,IV.,"A gleaming shape she floated by,"
5942,IV.,"Dead-pale between the houses high,"
5943,IV.,Silent into Camelot.
5944,IV.,"Out upon the wharfs they came,"
5945,IV.,"Knight and burgher[47], lord and dame,"
5946,IV.,"And round the prow they read her name,"
5947,IV.,_The Lady of Shalott_.
5948,IV.,
5949,IV.,Who is this? and what is here?
5950,IV.,And in the lighted palace near
5951,IV.,Died the sound of royal cheer;
5952,IV.,And they cross’d themselves for fear
5953,IV.,All the knights at Camelot:
5954,IV.,But Lancelot mused a little space;
5955,IV.,"He said, “She has a lovely face;"
5956,IV.,"God in his mercy lend her grace,"
5957,IV.,The Lady of Shalott.”

5986,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Call her once before you go--
5987,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Call once yet!
5988,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,In a voice that she will know:
5989,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,“Margaret! Margaret!”
5990,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Children’s voices should be dear

5995,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"This way, this way!"
5996,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“Mother dear, we cannot stay!”"

6004,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Then come down.

6007,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
6008,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
6009,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,We heard the sweet bells over the bay?
6010,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"In the caverns where we lay,"
6011,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Through the surf and through the swell,"
6012,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The far-off sound of a silver bell?
6013,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,"
6014,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Where the winds are all asleep;
6015,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Where the spent lights quiver and gleam;
6016,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Where the salt weed sways in the stream;
6017,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,"
6018,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;
6019,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,"
6020,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Dry their mail and bask in the brine;

6027,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, was it yesterday"
6028,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,(Call yet once) that she went away?
6029,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Once she sate with you and me,"
6030,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,"
6031,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the youngest sate on her knee.
6032,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She combed its bright hair, and she tended it well,"
6033,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.
6034,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She sigh’d, she look’d up through the clear green sea;"
6035,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She said: “I must go, for my kinsfolk pray"
6036,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"In the little grey church on the shore to-day,"
6037,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,’Twill be Easter-time in the world--ah me!
6038,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee.”"
6039,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"I said, “Go up, dear heart, through the waves;"
6040,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves.”"
6041,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay."
6042,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, was it yesterday?"
6043,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
6044,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Children dear, were we long alone?"
6045,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan."
6046,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Long prayers,” I said, “in the world they say."
6047,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come!” I said, and we rose through the surf in the bay."
6048,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We went up the beach, by the sandy down"
6049,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-walled town."
6050,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,"
6051,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,To the little grey church on the windy hill.
6052,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,"
6053,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.
6054,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We climb’d on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,"
6055,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.
6056,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:
6057,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"“Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!"
6058,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Dear heart,” I said, “we are long alone."
6059,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.”"
6060,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"But, ah! she gave me never a look,"
6061,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,For her eyes were sealed to the holy book.
6062,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.
6063,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, children, call no more."
6064,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, come down, call no more."
6065,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
6066,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Down, down, down,"
6067,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Down to the depths of the sea!
6068,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She sits at her wheel in the humming town,"
6069,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Singing most joyfully.
6070,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Hark what she sings: “O joy, O joy,"
6071,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the humming street, and the child with its toy!"
6072,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;"
6073,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"For the wheel where I spun,"
6074,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the blessèd light of the sun!”
6075,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And so she sings her fill.
6076,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing most joyfully,"
6077,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Till the spindle drops from her hand,"
6078,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the whizzing wheel stands still.
6079,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She steals to the window and looks at the sand,"
6080,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And over the sand at the sea;
6081,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And her eyes are set in a stare;
6082,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And anon there breaks a sigh,"
6083,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And anon there drops a tear,"
6084,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"From a sorrow-clouded eye,"
6085,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"And a heart sorrow-laden,"
6086,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"A long, long sigh"
6087,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden
6088,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And the gleam of her golden hair.
6089,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
6090,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come away, away, children!"
6091,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Come children, come down!"
6092,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The hoarse wind blows coldly;
6093,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Lights shine in the town.
6094,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She will start from her slumber
6095,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When gusts shake the door;
6096,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"She will hear the winds howling,"
6097,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Will hear the waves roar.
6098,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We shall see, while above us"
6099,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"The waves roar and whirl,"
6100,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"A ceiling of amber,"
6101,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,A pavement of pearl.
6102,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing: “Here came a mortal,"
6103,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,But faithless was she:
6104,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And alone dwell for ever
6105,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The kings of the sea.”
6106,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,
6107,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"But, children, at midnight,"
6108,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"When soft the winds blow,"
6109,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"When clear falls the moonlight,"
6110,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When spring-tides are low:
6111,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,When sweet airs come seaward
6112,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,From heaths starr’d with broom;
6113,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And high rocks throw mildly
6114,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,On the blanch’d sands a gloom:
6115,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Up the still, glistening beaches,"
6116,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Up the creeks we will hie,"
6117,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,Over banks of bright seaweed
6118,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The ebb-tide leaves dry.
6119,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"We will gaze, from the sand-hills,"
6120,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"At the white, sleeping town;"
6121,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,At the church on the hill-side--
6122,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,And then come back down.
6123,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,"Singing: “There dwells a loved one,"
6124,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,But cruel is she.
6125,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,She left lonely for ever
6126,THE FORSAKEN MERMAN,The kings of the sea.”

6134,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6135,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6136,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"“Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!”"
6137,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That is what the Vision said.
6138,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6139,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his chamber all alone,"
6140,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Kneeling on the floor of stone,"
6141,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
6142,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For his sins of indecision,"
6143,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed for greater self-denial
6144,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In temptation and in trial;
6145,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It was noonday by the dial,"
6146,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the Monk was all alone.
6147,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6148,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Suddenly, as if it lighten’d,"
6149,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,An unwonted splendour brighten’d
6150,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,All within him and without him
6151,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In that narrow cell of stone;
6152,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And he saw the Blessed Vision
6153,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of our Lord, with light Elysian[48]"
6154,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Like a vesture wrapped about him,"
6155,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a garment round him thrown.
6156,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6157,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not as crucified and slain,"
6158,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not in agonies of pain,"
6159,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not with bleeding hands and feet,"
6160,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Did the Monk his Master see;
6161,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But as in the village street,"
6162,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In the house or harvest-field,"
6163,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Halt and lame and blind he healed,"
6164,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,When he walked in Galilee.
6165,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6166,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In an attitude imploring,"
6167,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hands upon his bosom crossed,"
6168,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Wondering, worshipping, adoring,"
6169,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.
6170,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,"
6171,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who am I, that thus thou deignest"
6172,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,To reveal thyself to me?
6173,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who am I, that from the centre"
6174,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Of thy glory thou shouldst enter
6175,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"This poor cell, my guest to be?"
6176,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6177,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Then amid his exaltation,"
6178,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Loud the convent bell appalling,"
6179,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
6180,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rang through court and corridor
6181,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With persistent iteration
6182,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,He had never heard before.
6183,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,It was now the appointed hour
6184,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When alike in sun or shower,"
6185,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Winter’s cold or summer’s heat,"
6186,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,To the convent portals came
6187,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"All the blind and halt and lame,"
6188,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"All the beggars of the street,"
6189,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For their daily dole of food
6190,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Dealt them by the brotherhood;
6191,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And their almoner[49] was he
6192,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who upon his bended knee,"
6193,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rapt in silent ecstasy
6194,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of divinest self-surrender,"
6195,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Saw the Vision and the Splendour.
6196,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6197,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Deep distress and hesitation
6198,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Mingled with his adoration;
6199,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Should he go or should he stay?
6200,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Should he leave the poor to wait
6201,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hungry at the convent gate,"
6202,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Till the Vision passed away?
6203,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Should he slight his radiant guest,"
6204,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slight his visitant celestial,"
6205,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For a crowd of ragged, bestial"
6206,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Beggars at the convent gate?
6207,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision there remain?
6208,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision come again?
6209,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6210,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Then a voice within his breast
6211,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Whispered, audible and clear,"
6212,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,As if to the outward ear:
6213,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,“Do thy duty; that is best;
6214,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Leave unto thy Lord the rest!”
6215,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Straightway to his feet he started,"
6216,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And with longing look intent
6217,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"On the Blessed Vision bent,"
6218,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slowly from his cell departed,"
6219,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Slowly on his errand went.
6220,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6221,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the gate the poor were waiting,"
6222,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Looking through the iron grating,"
6223,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With that terror in the eye
6224,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That is only seen in those
6225,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Who amid their wants and woes
6226,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hear the sound of doors that close,"
6227,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And of feet that pass them by;
6228,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Grown familiar with disfavour,"
6229,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Grown familiar with the savour
6230,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Of the bread by which men die!
6231,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But to-day, they knew not why,"
6232,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like the gate of Paradise
6233,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Seemed the convent gate to rise,"
6234,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a sacrament divine
6235,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Seemed to them the bread and wine.
6236,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his heart the Monk was praying,"
6237,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thinking of the homeless poor,"
6238,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,What they suffer and endure;
6239,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"What we see not, what we see;"
6240,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the inward voice was saying:
6241,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,“Whatsoever thing thou doest
6242,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"To the least of mine and lowest,"
6243,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That thou doest unto me!”
6244,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6245,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Unto me! but had the Vision
6246,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Come to him in beggar’s clothing,"
6247,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Come a mendicant imploring,"
6248,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Would he then have knelt adoring,"
6249,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Or have listened with derision,"
6250,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And have turned away with loathing?
6251,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6252,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thus his conscience put the question,"
6253,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Full of troublesome suggestion,"
6254,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As at length, with hurried pace,"
6255,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Towards his cell he turned his face,"
6256,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And beheld the convent bright
6257,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"With a supernatural light,"
6258,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a luminous cloud expanding
6259,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Over floor and wall and ceiling.
6260,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6261,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,But he paused with awe-struck feeling
6262,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the threshold of his door,"
6263,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For the Vision still was standing
6264,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As he left it there before,"
6265,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the convent bell appalling,"
6266,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
6267,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Summoned him to feed the poor.
6268,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
6269,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Through the long hour intervening
6270,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It had waited his return,"
6271,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"And he felt his bosom burn,"
6272,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Comprehending all the meaning,"
6273,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the Blessed Vision said,"
6274,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"“Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!”"

6292,ABOU BEN ADHEM,An angel writing in a book of gold:--

6296,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"And with a look made all of sweet accord,"
6297,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"Answer’d, “The names of those that love the Lord.”"
6298,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"“And is mine one?” said Abou. “Nay, not so,”"
6299,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,"
6300,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"But cheerly still; and said, “I pray thee, then,"
6301,ABOU BEN ADHEM,Write me as one that loves his fellow men.”
6302,ABOU BEN ADHEM,
6303,ABOU BEN ADHEM,"The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night"

6353,LOCHINVAR,"Through all the wide Border his steed was the best,"
6354,LOCHINVAR,And save his good broad-sword he weapons had none;
6355,LOCHINVAR,"He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone."
6356,LOCHINVAR,"So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,"
6357,LOCHINVAR,There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.
6358,LOCHINVAR,
6359,LOCHINVAR,"He stay’d not for brake, and he stopp’d not for stone,"
6360,LOCHINVAR,He swam the Esk river where ford there was none;
6361,LOCHINVAR,"But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate,"
6362,LOCHINVAR,"The bride had consented, the gallant came late:"
6363,LOCHINVAR,"For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,"
6364,LOCHINVAR,Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.
6365,LOCHINVAR,
6366,LOCHINVAR,"So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,"
6367,LOCHINVAR,"Among bride’s-men and kinsmen, and brothers and all:"
6368,LOCHINVAR,"Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword"
6369,LOCHINVAR,"(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),"
6370,LOCHINVAR,"“O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,"
6371,LOCHINVAR,"Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?”"
6372,LOCHINVAR,
6373,LOCHINVAR,"“I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied:--"

6383,LOCHINVAR,With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye.
6384,LOCHINVAR,"He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,--"
6385,LOCHINVAR,“Now tread we a measure!” said young Lochinvar.
6386,LOCHINVAR,
6387,LOCHINVAR,"So stately his form, and so lovely her face,"
6388,LOCHINVAR,That never a hall such a galliard[50] did grace;
6389,LOCHINVAR,"While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,"
6390,LOCHINVAR,And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;
6391,LOCHINVAR,"And the bride-maidens whisper’d, “’Twere better by far"
6392,LOCHINVAR,To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.”
6393,LOCHINVAR,
6394,LOCHINVAR,"One touch to her hand and one word in her ear,"
6395,LOCHINVAR,When they reach’d the hall door and the charger stood near;
6396,LOCHINVAR,"So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,"
6397,LOCHINVAR,So light to the saddle before her he sprung!
6398,LOCHINVAR,"“She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur[51];"
6399,LOCHINVAR,"They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,” quoth young Lochinvar."
6400,LOCHINVAR,
6401,LOCHINVAR,There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;
6402,LOCHINVAR,"Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran:"
6403,LOCHINVAR,"There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,"
6404,LOCHINVAR,But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.

6466,THE LOST BOWER,Steps in jocund childhood played--
6467,THE LOST BOWER,"Dimpled close with hill and valley,"
6468,THE LOST BOWER,Dappled very close with shade;
6469,THE LOST BOWER,"Summer-snow of apple blossoms, running up from glade to glade."

6474,THE LOST BOWER,"As it climbeth from the west,"
6475,THE LOST BOWER,"Sideway from the tree-locked valley, to the airy upland crest."
6476,THE LOST BOWER,

6478,THE LOST BOWER,"And, completing the ascent,"
6479,THE LOST BOWER,"Where the wind blows and sun dazzles,"
6480,THE LOST BOWER,Thrills in leafy tremblement:
6481,THE LOST BOWER,"Like a heart that, after climbing, beateth quickly through content."
6482,THE LOST BOWER,
6483,THE LOST BOWER,Not a step the wood advances
6484,THE LOST BOWER,O’er the open hill-top’s bound:
6485,THE LOST BOWER,"There, in green arrest, the branches"

6494,THE LOST BOWER,"And the squirrels crack the filberts, through their cheerful madrigal."
6495,THE LOST BOWER,
6496,THE LOST BOWER,"On your left, the sheep are cropping"
6497,THE LOST BOWER,The slant grass and daisies pale;
6498,THE LOST BOWER,"And five apple-trees stand, dropping"
6499,THE LOST BOWER,"Separate shadows toward the vale,"
6500,THE LOST BOWER,"Over which, in choral silence, the hills look you their “All hail!”"
6501,THE LOST BOWER,
6502,THE LOST BOWER,Yet in childhood little prized I
6503,THE LOST BOWER,That fair walk and far survey:
6504,THE LOST BOWER,"’Twas a straight walk, unadvised by"
6505,THE LOST BOWER,The least mischief worth a nay--
6506,THE LOST BOWER,Up and down--as dull as grammar on an eve of holiday!
6507,THE LOST BOWER,
6508,THE LOST BOWER,"But the wood, all close and clenching"
6509,THE LOST BOWER,"Bough in bough and root in root,--"
6510,THE LOST BOWER,No more sky (for over-branching)
6511,THE LOST BOWER,"At your head than at your foot,--"
6512,THE LOST BOWER,"Oh, the wood drew me within it, by a glamour past dispute."
6513,THE LOST BOWER,
6514,THE LOST BOWER,"Few and broken paths showed through it,"
6515,THE LOST BOWER,"Where the sheep had tried to run,--"
6516,THE LOST BOWER,Forced with snowy wool to strew it
6517,THE LOST BOWER,"Round the thickets, when anon"
6518,THE LOST BOWER,They with silly thorn-pricked noses bleated back into the sun.
6519,THE LOST BOWER,
6520,THE LOST BOWER,But my childish heart beat stronger
6521,THE LOST BOWER,Than those thickets dared to grow:
6522,THE LOST BOWER,_I_ could pierce them! _I_ could longer
6523,THE LOST BOWER,"Travel on, methought, than so!"
6524,THE LOST BOWER,Sheep for sheep-paths! braver children climb and creep where they

6530,THE LOST BOWER,"Thorns that prick and boughs that bear,"
6531,THE LOST BOWER,I stood suddenly astonished--I was gladdened unaware!
6532,THE LOST BOWER,
6533,THE LOST BOWER,"From the place I stood in, floated"
6534,THE LOST BOWER,Back the covert dim and close;
6535,THE LOST BOWER,And the open ground was suited
6536,THE LOST BOWER,"Carpet-smooth with grass and moss,"
6537,THE LOST BOWER,And the blue-bell’s purple presence signed it worthily across.
6538,THE LOST BOWER,
6539,THE LOST BOWER,"’Twas a bower for garden fitter,"
6540,THE LOST BOWER,Than for any woodland wide!
6541,THE LOST BOWER,Though a fresh and dewy glitter
6542,THE LOST BOWER,"Struck it through, from side to side,"
6543,THE LOST BOWER,"Shaped and shaven was the freshness, as by garden-cunning plied."
6544,THE LOST BOWER,
6545,THE LOST BOWER,"Rose-trees, either side the door, were"
6546,THE LOST BOWER,Growing lithe and growing tall;
6547,THE LOST BOWER,Each one set a summer warder
6548,THE LOST BOWER,"For the keeping of the hall,--"
6549,THE LOST BOWER,"With a red rose, and a white rose, leaning, nodding at the wall."
6550,THE LOST BOWER,
6551,THE LOST BOWER,As I entered--mosses hushing
6552,THE LOST BOWER,Stole all noises from my foot:
6553,THE LOST BOWER,"And a round elastic cushion,"
6554,THE LOST BOWER,"Clasped within the linden’s root,"
6555,THE LOST BOWER,"Took me in a chair of silence, very rare and absolute."
6556,THE LOST BOWER,
6557,THE LOST BOWER,"So, young muser, I sat listening"
6558,THE LOST BOWER,To my Fancy’s wildest word--
6559,THE LOST BOWER,"On a sudden, through the glistening"
6560,THE LOST BOWER,"Leaves around, a little stirred,"
6561,THE LOST BOWER,"Came a sound, a sense of music, which was rather felt than heard."
6562,THE LOST BOWER,
6563,THE LOST BOWER,"Softly, finely, it inwound me--"
6564,THE LOST BOWER,"From the world it shut me in,--"
6565,THE LOST BOWER,"Like a fountain falling round me,"
6566,THE LOST BOWER,Which with silver waters thin
6567,THE LOST BOWER,"Clips a little marble Naiad, sitting smilingly within."
6568,THE LOST BOWER,
6569,THE LOST BOWER,"Whence the music came, who knoweth?"
6570,THE LOST BOWER,_I_ know nothing. But indeed
6571,THE LOST BOWER,Pan or Faunus never bloweth
6572,THE LOST BOWER,So much sweetness from a reed
6573,THE LOST BOWER,"Which has sucked the milk of waters, at the oldest river-head."
6574,THE LOST BOWER,
6575,THE LOST BOWER,Never lark the sun can waken
6576,THE LOST BOWER,"With such sweetness! when the lark,"
6577,THE LOST BOWER,The high planets overtaking
6578,THE LOST BOWER,"In the half-evanished Dark,"
6579,THE LOST BOWER,"Casts his singing to their singing, like an arrow to the mark."
6580,THE LOST BOWER,
6581,THE LOST BOWER,Never nightingale so singeth--
6582,THE LOST BOWER,"Oh! she leans on thorny tree,"
6583,THE LOST BOWER,And her poet-soul she flingeth
6584,THE LOST BOWER,Over pain to victory!
6585,THE LOST BOWER,"Yet she never sings such music,--or she sings it not to me!"
6586,THE LOST BOWER,
6587,THE LOST BOWER,"Never blackbirds, never thrushes,"
6588,THE LOST BOWER,"Nor small finches sing as sweet,"
6589,THE LOST BOWER,When the sun strikes through the bushes
6590,THE LOST BOWER,"To their crimson clinging feet,"
6591,THE LOST BOWER,And their pretty eyes look sideways to the summer heavens complete.
6592,THE LOST BOWER,
6593,THE LOST BOWER,"In a child-abstraction lifted,"
6594,THE LOST BOWER,Straightway from the bower I passed;
6595,THE LOST BOWER,Foot and soul being dimly drifted
6596,THE LOST BOWER,"Through the greenwood, till, at last,"
6597,THE LOST BOWER,"In the hill-top’s open sunshine, I all consciously was cast."
6598,THE LOST BOWER,
6599,THE LOST BOWER,"And I said within me, laughing,"
6600,THE LOST BOWER,"I have found a bower to-day,"
6601,THE LOST BOWER,A green lusus[52]--fashioned half in
6602,THE LOST BOWER,"Chance, and half in Nature’s play--"
6603,THE LOST BOWER,"And a little bird sings nigh it, I will never more missay."
6604,THE LOST BOWER,
6605,THE LOST BOWER,"Henceforth, _I_ will be the fairy"
6606,THE LOST BOWER,"Of this bower, not built by one;"
6607,THE LOST BOWER,"I will go there, sad or merry,"
6608,THE LOST BOWER,With each morning’s benison;
6609,THE LOST BOWER,And the bird shall be my harper in the dream-hall I have won.
6610,THE LOST BOWER,
6611,THE LOST BOWER,"So I said. But the next morning,"
6612,THE LOST BOWER,"(--Child, look up into my face--"
6613,THE LOST BOWER,"’Ware, O sceptic, of your scorning!"
6614,THE LOST BOWER,This is truth in its pure grace;)
6615,THE LOST BOWER,"The next morning, all had vanished, or my wandering missed the place."
6616,THE LOST BOWER,
6617,THE LOST BOWER,"Day by day, with new desire,"
6618,THE LOST BOWER,Toward my wood I ran in faith--
6619,THE LOST BOWER,Under leaf and over brier--
6620,THE LOST BOWER,"Through the thickets, out of breath--"
6621,THE LOST BOWER,Like the prince who rescued Beauty from the sleep as long as death.
6622,THE LOST BOWER,
6623,THE LOST BOWER,"But his sword of mettle clashèd,"
6624,THE LOST BOWER,"And his arm smote strong, I ween;"
6625,THE LOST BOWER,And her dreaming spirit flashèd
6626,THE LOST BOWER,"Through her body’s fair white screen,"
6627,THE LOST BOWER,And the light thereof might guide him up the cedarn alleys green.
6628,THE LOST BOWER,
6629,THE LOST BOWER,"But for me, I saw no splendour--"
6630,THE LOST BOWER,All my sword was my child-heart;
6631,THE LOST BOWER,And the wood refused surrender
6632,THE LOST BOWER,"Of that bower it held apart,"
6633,THE LOST BOWER,"Safe as Œdipus’s grave-place, ’mid Colone’s olives swart."
6634,THE LOST BOWER,
6635,THE LOST BOWER,I have lost--oh many a pleasure--
6636,THE LOST BOWER,"Many a hope, and many a power--"
6637,THE LOST BOWER,Studious health and merry leisure--
6638,THE LOST BOWER,The first dew on the first flower!
6639,THE LOST BOWER,But the first of all my losses was the losing of the bower.
6640,THE LOST BOWER,
6641,THE LOST BOWER,"All my losses did I tell you,"
6642,THE LOST BOWER,"Ye, perchance, would look away;--"
6643,THE LOST BOWER,"Ye would answer me, “Farewell! you"
6644,THE LOST BOWER,Make sad company to-day;
6645,THE LOST BOWER,And your tears are falling faster than the bitter words you say.”
6646,THE LOST BOWER,
6647,THE LOST BOWER,For God placed me like a dial
6648,THE LOST BOWER,"In the open ground, with power;"
6649,THE LOST BOWER,"And my heart had for its trial,"
6650,THE LOST BOWER,All the sun and all the shower!
6651,THE LOST BOWER,And I suffered many losses; and my first was of the bower.

6665,ECHO AND THE FERRY,They had told us to play in the orchard (and I only seven!
6666,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"A small guest at the farm); but he said, “Oh, a girl was no good,”"

6675,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"So Oliver went, but the cowslips were tall at my feet,"

6681,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And I saw a round hole in an apple-tree rosy and old.
6682,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Then I knew! for I peeped, and I felt it was right they should"
6683,ECHO AND THE FERRY,scold!
6684,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Eggs small and eggs many. For gladness I broke into laughter;
6685,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And then some one else--oh, how softly! came after, came after"
6686,ECHO AND THE FERRY,With laughter--with laughter came after.
6687,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6688,ECHO AND THE FERRY,So this was the country; clear dazzle of azure and shiver
6689,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And whisper of leaves, and a humming all over the tall"
6690,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"White branches, a humming of bees. And I came to the wall--"
6691,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"A little low wall--and looked over, and there was the river,"
6692,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"The lane that led on to the village, and then the sweet river."
6693,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Clear-shining and slow, she had far far to go from her snow;"
6694,ECHO AND THE FERRY,But each rush gleamed a sword in the sunlight to guard her long
6695,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"flow,"
6696,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And she murmured methought, with a speech very soft, very low--"
6697,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“The ways will be long, but the days will be long,” quoth the"
6698,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"river,"
6699,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“To me a long liver, long, long!” quoth the river--the river."
6700,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6701,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"I dreamed of the country that night, of the orchard, the sky,"
6702,ECHO AND THE FERRY,The voice that had mocked coming after and over and under.
6703,ECHO AND THE FERRY,But at last--in a day or two namely--Eleven and I
6704,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Were very fast friends, and to him I confided the wonder."
6705,ECHO AND THE FERRY,He said that was Echo. “Was Echo a wise kind of bee
6706,ECHO AND THE FERRY,That had learned how to laugh: could it laugh in one’s ear and then
6707,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"fly,"
6708,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And laugh again yonder?” “No; Echo”--he whispered it low--
6709,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“Was a woman, they said, but a woman whom no one could see"
6710,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And no one could find; and he did not believe it, not he,"
6711,ECHO AND THE FERRY,But he could not get near for the river that held us asunder.
6712,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Yet I that had money--a shilling, a whole silver shilling--"
6713,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"We might cross if I thought I would spend it.” “Oh yes, I was"
6714,ECHO AND THE FERRY,willing”--
6715,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And we ran hand in hand, we ran down to the ferry, the ferry,"
6716,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And we heard how she mocked at the folk with a voice clear and merry
6717,ECHO AND THE FERRY,When they called for the ferry; but oh! she was very--was very
6718,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Swift-footed. She spoke and was gone; and when Oliver cried,"
6719,ECHO AND THE FERRY,“Hie over! hie over! you man of the ferry--the ferry!”
6720,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"By the still water’s side she was heard far and wide--she replied,"
6721,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And she mocked in her voice sweet and merry “You man of the ferry,"
6722,ECHO AND THE FERRY,You man of--you man of the ferry!”
6723,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6724,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“Hie over!” he shouted. The ferryman came at his calling,"
6725,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Across the clear reed-bordered river he ferried us fast;--
6726,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Such a chase! Hand in hand, foot to foot, we ran on; it surpassed"
6727,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"All measure her doubling--so close, then so far away falling,"
6728,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Then gone, and no more. Oh! to see her but once unaware,"
6729,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And the mouth that had mocked, but we might not (yet sure she was"
6730,ECHO AND THE FERRY,there!)
6731,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Nor behold her wild eyes and her mystical countenance fair.
6732,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6733,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"We sought in the wood, and we found the wood-wren in her stead;"
6734,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"In the field, and we found but the cuckoo that talked overhead;"
6735,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"By the brook, and we found the reed-sparrow deep-nested, in brown--"
6736,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Not Echo, fair Echo! for Echo, sweet Echo! was flown."
6737,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6738,ECHO AND THE FERRY,So we came to the place where the dead people wait till God call.
6739,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"The church was among them, grey moss over roof, over wall."
6740,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Very silent, so low. And we stood on a green grassy mound"
6741,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And looked in at a window, for Echo, perhaps, in her round"
6742,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Might have come in to hide there. But no; every oak carven seat
6743,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Was empty. We saw the great Bible--old, old, very old,"
6744,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And the parson’s great Prayer-book beside it; we heard the slow beat
6745,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Of the pendulum swing in the tower; we saw the clear gold
6746,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Of a sunbeam float down to the aisle and then waver and play
6747,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"On the low chancel step and the railing, and Oliver said,"
6748,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“Look, Katie! Look, Katie! when Lettice came here to be wed"
6749,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"She stood where that sunbeam drops down, and all white was her gown;"
6750,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And she stepped upon flowers they strewed for her.” Then quoth small
6751,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Seven,"
6752,ECHO AND THE FERRY,“Shall I wear a white gown and have flowers to walk upon ever?”
6753,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6754,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"All doubtful: “It takes a long time to grow up,” quoth Eleven;"
6755,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“You’re so little, you know, and the church is so old, it can never"
6756,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Last on till you’re tall.” And in whispers--because it was old,"
6757,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And holy, and fraught with strange meaning, half felt, but not told,"
6758,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Full of old parsons’ prayers, who were dead, of old days, of old folk"
6759,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Neither heard nor beheld, but about us, in whispers we spoke."
6760,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Then we went from it softly, and ran hand in hand to the strand,"
6761,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"While bleating of flocks and birds piping made sweeter the land,"
6762,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"And Echo came back e’en as Oliver drew to the ferry,"
6763,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“O Katie!” “O Katie!” “Come on, then!” “Come on, then!” “For, see,"
6764,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"The round sun, all red, lying low by the tree”--“by the tree.”"
6765,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“By the tree.” Ay, she mocked him again, with her voice sweet and"
6766,ECHO AND THE FERRY,merry:
6767,ECHO AND THE FERRY,“Hie over!” “Hie over!” “You man of the ferry”--“the ferry.”
6768,ECHO AND THE FERRY,“You man of the ferry--you man of--you man of--the ferry.”
6769,ECHO AND THE FERRY,
6770,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Ay, here--it was here that we woke her, the Echo of old;"
6771,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"All life of that day seems an echo, and many times told."
6772,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Shall I cross by the ferry to-morrow, and come in my white"
6773,ECHO AND THE FERRY,To that little old church? and will Oliver meet me anon?
6774,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Will it all seem an echo from childhood passed over--passed on?
6775,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Will the grave parson bless us? Hark, hark! in the dim failing light"
6776,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"I hear her! As then the child’s voice clear and high, sweet and merry"
6777,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Now she mocks the man’s tone with “Hie over! Hie over the ferry!”
6778,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"“And Katie.” “And Katie.” “Art out with the glowworms to-night,"
6779,ECHO AND THE FERRY,My Katie?” “My Katie.” For gladness I break into laughter
6780,ECHO AND THE FERRY,And tears. Then it all comes again as from far-away years;
6781,ECHO AND THE FERRY,"Again, some one else--Oh, how softly!--with laughter comes after,"
6782,ECHO AND THE FERRY,Comes after--with laughter comes after.

7034,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"So in happy mood we went,"
7035,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Laughing to the Tournament.
7036,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7037,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"What a bustle at the inn,"
7038,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"What a stir, without--within;"
7039,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Filling flagons, brimming bowls"
7040,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,For a hundred thirsty souls;
7041,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Froth in snow-flakes flowing down,"
7042,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"From the pitcher big and brown,"
7043,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,While the tankards brim and bubble
7044,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,With the balm for human trouble;
7045,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"How the maiden coyly sips,"
7046,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"How the yeoman wipes his lips,"
7047,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,How the old knight drains the cup
7048,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Slowly and with calmness up,"
7049,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And the abbot, with a prayer,"
7050,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Fills the silver goblet rare,"
7051,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Praying to the saints for strength
7052,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,As he holds it at arm’s length;
7053,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,How the jester spins the bowl
7054,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"On his thumb, then quaffs the whole;"
7055,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,How the pompous steward bends
7056,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And bows to half-a-dozen friends,"

7058,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Duly to the Tournament.
7059,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7060,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Then again the country over
7061,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Through the stubble and the clover,"
7062,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"By the crystal-dropping springs,"
7063,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Where the road dust clogs and clings
7064,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"To the pearl-leaf of the rose,"
7065,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Where the tawdry nightshade blows,"
7066,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,And the bramble twines its chains
7067,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Through the sunny village lanes,"
7068,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Where the thistle sheds its seed,"
7069,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And the goldfinch loves to feed,"
7070,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"By the milestone green with moss,"
7071,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"By the broken wayside cross,"
7072,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,In a merry band we went
7073,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Shouting to the Tournament.
7074,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7075,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Pilgrims with their hood and cowl,"
7076,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Pursy burghers cheek by jowl,"
7077,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Archers with their peacock’s wing
7078,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Fitting to the waxen string,"

7085,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,All in gay confusion went
7086,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,To the royal Tournament.
7087,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7088,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Players with the painted face
7089,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And a drunken man’s grimace,"
7090,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Grooms who praise their raw-boned steeds,"
7091,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Old wives telling maple beads,--"
7092,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Blackbirds from the hedges broke,"
7093,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Black crows from the beeches croak,"
7094,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Glossy swallows in dismay
7095,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"From the mill-stream fled away,"
7096,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"The angry swan, with ruffled breast,"
7097,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Frowned upon her osier nest,"
7098,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"The wren hopped restless on the brake,"
7099,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"The otter made the sedges shake,"
7100,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,The butterfly before our rout
7101,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Flew like a blossom blown about,"
7102,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"The coloured leaves, a globe of life,"
7103,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Spun round and scattered as in strife,"
7104,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Sweeping down the narrow lane
7105,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Like the slant shower of the rain,"
7106,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"The lark in terror, from the sod,"
7107,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Flew up and straight appealed to God,"
7108,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,As a noisy band we went
7109,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Trotting to the Tournament.
7110,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7111,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"But when we saw the holy town,"
7112,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"With its river and its down,"
7113,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Then the drums began to beat
7114,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,And the flutes piped mellow sweet;
7115,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Then the deep and full bassoon
7116,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Murmured like a wood in June,"
7117,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And the fifes, so sharp and bleak,"
7118,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,All at once began to speak.
7119,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Hear the trumpets clear and loud,"
7120,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Full-tongued, eloquent and proud,"
7121,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,And the dulcimer that ranges
7122,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Through such wild and plaintive changes;
7123,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Merry sounds the jester’s shawm[56],"
7124,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,To our gladness giving form;
7125,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"And the shepherd’s chalumeau[57],"
7126,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Rich and soft and sad and low;
7127,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Hark! the bagpipes squeak and groan--
7128,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Every herdsman has his own;
7129,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,So in measured step we went
7130,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Pacing to the Tournament.
7131,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,
7132,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"All at once the chimes break out,"
7133,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Then we hear the townsmen shout,"
7134,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,And the morris-dancers’ bells
7135,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Tinkling in the grassy dells;
7136,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,The bell thunder from the tower
7137,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,"Adds its sound of doom and power,"
7138,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,As the cannon’s loud salute
7139,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,For a moment made us mute;
7140,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Then again the laugh and joke
7141,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,On the startled silence broke;--
7142,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Thus in merry mood we went
7143,THE RIDING TO THE TOURNAMENT,Laughing to the Tournament.

7261,GENSERIC,"From Tripolis far as Tangier, from the sea to the great desert sands,"
7262,GENSERIC,"Was lord of the Moor and the African,--thirsting anon for new"

7264,GENSERIC,"Sail’d out of Carthage, and sail’d o’er the Mediterranean water;"

7266,GENSERIC,"And paused, and said, laughing, “Where next?”"
7267,GENSERIC,Then there came to the Vandal a Ghost
7268,GENSERIC,From the Shadowy Land that lies hid and unknown in the Darkness Below.
7269,GENSERIC,"And answered, “To Rome!”"
7270,GENSERIC,"Said the King to the Ghost, “And whose envoy art thou?"
7271,GENSERIC,Whence com’st thou? and name me his name that hath sent thee: and say
7272,GENSERIC,what is thine.”
7273,GENSERIC,"“From far: and His name that hath sent me is God,” the Ghost answered,"

7275,GENSERIC,"Was Hannibal once, ere thou wast: and the name that I now have is"

7277,GENSERIC,"But arise, and be swift, and return. For God waits, and the moment is"

7288,GENSERIC,Rome gave him her glorious things;
7289,GENSERIC,The keys she had conquer’d from kingdoms: the crowns she had wrested
7290,GENSERIC,from kings:
7291,GENSERIC,"And Genseric bore them away into Carthage, avenged thus on Rome,"
7292,GENSERIC,"And paused, and said, laughing, “Where next?”"

7294,GENSERIC,For now God doth need thee no longer.”
7295,GENSERIC,“Where leadest thou me by the hand?”

7308,KUBLA KHAN,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
7309,KUBLA KHAN,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
7310,KUBLA KHAN,Through caverns measureless to man
7311,KUBLA KHAN,Down to a sunless sea.
7312,KUBLA KHAN,So twice five miles of fertile ground
7313,KUBLA KHAN,With walls and towers were girdled round:
7314,KUBLA KHAN,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
7315,KUBLA KHAN,Where blossom’d many an incense-bearing tree;
7316,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
7317,KUBLA KHAN,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
7318,KUBLA KHAN,"But O, that deep romantic chasm which slanted"
7319,KUBLA KHAN,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
7320,KUBLA KHAN,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
7321,KUBLA KHAN,As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
7322,KUBLA KHAN,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
7323,KUBLA KHAN,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
7324,KUBLA KHAN,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
7325,KUBLA KHAN,A mighty fountain momently was forced;
7326,KUBLA KHAN,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
7327,KUBLA KHAN,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
7328,KUBLA KHAN,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:
7329,KUBLA KHAN,And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
7330,KUBLA KHAN,It flung up momently the sacred river.
7331,KUBLA KHAN,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
7332,KUBLA KHAN,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
7333,KUBLA KHAN,"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,"
7334,KUBLA KHAN,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
7335,KUBLA KHAN,And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
7336,KUBLA KHAN,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
7337,KUBLA KHAN,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
7338,KUBLA KHAN,Floated midway on the waves;
7339,KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
7340,KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
7341,KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
7342,KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
7343,KUBLA KHAN,
7344,KUBLA KHAN,A damsel with a dulcimer
7345,KUBLA KHAN,In a vision once I saw:
7346,KUBLA KHAN,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
7347,KUBLA KHAN,"And on her dulcimer she play’d,"
7348,KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
7349,KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me
7350,KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"
7351,KUBLA KHAN,To such a deep delight ’twould win me
7352,KUBLA KHAN,"That with music loud and long,"
7353,KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
7354,KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
7355,KUBLA KHAN,"And all who heard should see them there,"
7356,KUBLA KHAN,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
7357,KUBLA KHAN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
7358,KUBLA KHAN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
7359,KUBLA KHAN,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
7360,KUBLA KHAN,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
7361,KUBLA KHAN,And drunk the milk of Paradise.
