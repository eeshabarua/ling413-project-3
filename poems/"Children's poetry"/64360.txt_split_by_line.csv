98,THE PIRATE FROG.,
99,THE PIRATE FROG.,
100,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
101,THE PIRATE FROG.,
102,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Some boys whose names I do not know,"
103,THE PIRATE FROG.,Went out to sail their boat one day:
104,THE PIRATE FROG.,Fast to her stern they tied a line
105,THE PIRATE FROG.,So she could not sail far away
106,THE PIRATE FROG.,But little did those boys suspect
107,THE PIRATE FROG.,"That, just beyond a floating log,"
108,THE PIRATE FROG.,"With all his trusty followers,"
109,THE PIRATE FROG.,There lay in wait the Pirate Frog.]
110,THE PIRATE FROG.,
111,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
112,THE PIRATE FROG.,
113,THE PIRATE FROG.,On came the ship; out sprang the frogs—
114,THE PIRATE FROG.,"A desperate, determined crew."
115,THE PIRATE FROG.,They climbed aboard with reckless speed
116,THE PIRATE FROG.,And each one found his work to do.
117,THE PIRATE FROG.,"One cut the line, one raised the flag,"
118,THE PIRATE FROG.,The captain seized the helm to steer;
119,THE PIRATE FROG.,"And thus, on peaceful Plunkett’s Pond,"
120,THE PIRATE FROG.,Began the Pirate Frog’s career.]
121,THE PIRATE FROG.,
122,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
123,THE PIRATE FROG.,
124,THE PIRATE FROG.,Upon the shore of Plunkett’s Pond
125,THE PIRATE FROG.,Three turtles basked beneath the sun;
126,THE PIRATE FROG.,"’Twas afternoon, the spot was warm,"
127,THE PIRATE FROG.,And they were dozing every one.
128,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Their eyes were closed, they did not see"
129,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Around the point a sail appear,"
130,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Nor did they know, until too late,"
131,THE PIRATE FROG.,The dreaded Pirate Frog was near.]
132,THE PIRATE FROG.,
133,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
134,THE PIRATE FROG.,
135,THE PIRATE FROG.,The pirate crew made haste to land:
136,THE PIRATE FROG.,"They ran to where the turtles lay,"
137,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Turned all three quickly on their backs,"
138,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Then, hoisting sail, sped fast away."
139,THE PIRATE FROG.,For hours the turtles strained and scratched
140,THE PIRATE FROG.,"To turn themselves, but all in vain,"
141,THE PIRATE FROG.,Till Mrs. Muskrat came that way
142,THE PIRATE FROG.,And set them right side up again.]
143,THE PIRATE FROG.,
144,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
145,THE PIRATE FROG.,
146,THE PIRATE FROG.,"As out of Turtle Bay he sailed,"
147,THE PIRATE FROG.,"The Pirate Frog the waters scanned,"
148,THE PIRATE FROG.,And soon he steered his stolen ship
149,THE PIRATE FROG.,To catch some ducklings far from land.
150,THE PIRATE FROG.,Around the downy neck of one
151,THE PIRATE FROG.,"A lasso made of cord he cast,"
152,THE PIRATE FROG.,"And, though the victim struggled hard,"
153,THE PIRATE FROG.,The cord was strong; the knot held fast.]
154,THE PIRATE FROG.,
155,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
156,THE PIRATE FROG.,
157,THE PIRATE FROG.,"The other ducklings hurried home,"
158,THE PIRATE FROG.,When this unequal fight began:
159,THE PIRATE FROG.,All breathlessly they told the news
160,THE PIRATE FROG.,To Uncle Peter Pelican.
161,THE PIRATE FROG.,"He hurried out across the pond,"
162,THE PIRATE FROG.,And first he cut the duckling’s cord;
163,THE PIRATE FROG.,Which gave the frightened pirates time
164,THE PIRATE FROG.,To dive to safety overboard.]
165,THE PIRATE FROG.,
166,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
167,THE PIRATE FROG.,
168,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Far up the shores of Plunkett’s Pond,"
169,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Within a deep and marshy bay,"
170,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Amid the rustling rushes green,"
171,THE PIRATE FROG.,The muskrats’ cozy village lay.
172,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Now, when the older rats were gone,"
173,THE PIRATE FROG.,The little ratlings had no fear;
174,THE PIRATE FROG.,’Twould have been different had they known
175,THE PIRATE FROG.,The dreaded Pirate Frog was near.]
176,THE PIRATE FROG.,
177,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
178,THE PIRATE FROG.,
179,THE PIRATE FROG.,But soon the pirates’ flag was seen—
180,THE PIRATE FROG.,The town was taken by surprise.
181,THE PIRATE FROG.,One baby rat was caught and bound
182,THE PIRATE FROG.,And dragged on ship despite his cries.
183,THE PIRATE FROG.,But soon his bonds were gnawed apart
184,THE PIRATE FROG.,"And he for safety scaled the mast,"
185,THE PIRATE FROG.,His weight aloft o’erset the ship
186,THE PIRATE FROG.,And he laughed best for he laughed last.]
187,THE PIRATE FROG.,
188,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
189,THE PIRATE FROG.,
190,THE PIRATE FROG.,"’Twas in July; the sun was hot,"
191,THE PIRATE FROG.,"The pond was smooth, the air was still."
192,THE PIRATE FROG.,The Pirate’s vessel lay becalmed
193,THE PIRATE FROG.,Without a breeze the sail to fill;
194,THE PIRATE FROG.,But soon a plan had been devised
195,THE PIRATE FROG.,To move the ship without a sail:
196,THE PIRATE FROG.,A diving frog took down a line
197,THE PIRATE FROG.,And tied it ’round a bull-head’s tail.]
198,THE PIRATE FROG.,
199,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
200,THE PIRATE FROG.,
201,THE PIRATE FROG.,"The big fish felt a gentle tug,"
202,THE PIRATE FROG.,Then saw the line and jumped with fright.
203,THE PIRATE FROG.,"He tried in vain to shake it off,"
204,THE PIRATE FROG.,And swam away with all his might.
205,THE PIRATE FROG.,"This way and that, at race-horse speed,"
206,THE PIRATE FROG.,"He crossed the pond from side to side,"
207,THE PIRATE FROG.,"But where he went the ship went, too,"
208,THE PIRATE FROG.,And all the frogs enjoyed the ride.]
209,THE PIRATE FROG.,
210,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
211,THE PIRATE FROG.,
212,THE PIRATE FROG.,For weeks the wicked Pirate Frog
213,THE PIRATE FROG.,Had filled the water folk with fright;
214,THE PIRATE FROG.,"They hid themselves throughout the day,"
215,THE PIRATE FROG.,While few dared venture out at night.
216,THE PIRATE FROG.,Had he not grown too rash and bold
217,THE PIRATE FROG.,They might be living that way still;
218,THE PIRATE FROG.,But his career closed when he tried
219,THE PIRATE FROG.,To stop the busy water mill.]
220,THE PIRATE FROG.,
221,THE PIRATE FROG.,[Illustration:
222,THE PIRATE FROG.,
223,THE PIRATE FROG.,He planned to drive his stolen ship
224,THE PIRATE FROG.,Against the wheel and tie it fast.
225,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Nor did he think, on starting out,"
226,THE PIRATE FROG.,That this exploit would be his last.
227,THE PIRATE FROG.,"Too late he saw his grave mistake,"
228,THE PIRATE FROG.,He tried in vain to reach the shore—
229,THE PIRATE FROG.,"The pirates’ ship was ground to bits,"
230,THE PIRATE FROG.,And Plunkett’s Pond knew them no more.]

236,THE PIRATE FROG.,
237,THE PIRATE FROG.,Old Daddy Longlegs sat him down
238,THE PIRATE FROG.,And wept in deepest woe.
239,THE PIRATE FROG.,"“Alas!” he cried, “The summer’s gone"
240,THE PIRATE FROG.,“And soon will come the snow.
241,THE PIRATE FROG.,"“My children beg for warmer clothes,"
242,THE PIRATE FROG.,“But yet I must refuse
243,THE PIRATE FROG.,“For each one has so many feet
244,THE PIRATE FROG.,“I can’t buy overshoes.”]
